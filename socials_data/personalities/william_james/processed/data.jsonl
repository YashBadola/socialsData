In 1907 he\ncollected reprints in an envelope which he inscribed with the title\n'Essays in Radical Empiricism'; and he also had duplicate sets of these\nreprints bound, under the same title, and deposited for the use of\nstudents in the general Harvard Library, and in the Philosophical\nLibrary in Emerson Hall.\nTwo years later Professor James published _The Meaning of Truth_ and _A\nPluralistic Universe_, and inserted in these volumes several of the\narticles which he had intended to use in the 'Essays in Radical\nEmpiricism.' Whether he would nevertheless have carried out his original\nplan, had he lived, cannot be certainly known. Several facts, however,\nstand out very clearly. In the first place, the articles included in the\noriginal plan but omitted from his later volumes are indispensable to\nthe understanding of his other writings. To these articles he repeatedly\nalludes. Thus, in _The Meaning of Truth_ (p. 127), he says: \"This\nstatement is probably excessively obscure to any one who has not read my\ntwo articles 'Does Consciousness Exist?' and 'A World of Pure\nExperience.'\" Other allusions have been indicated in the present text.\nIn the second place, the articles originally brought together as 'Essays\nin Radical Empiricism' form a connected whole. Not only were most of\nthem written consecutively within a period of two years, but they\ncontain numerous cross-references. In the third place, Professor James\nregarded 'radical empiricism' as an _independent_ doctrine. This he\nasserted expressly: \"Let me say that there is no logical connexion\nbetween pragmatism, as I understand it, and a doctrine which I have\nrecently set forth as 'radical empiricism.' The latter stands on its own\nfeet. One may entirely reject it and still be a pragmatist.\"\n(_Pragmatism_, 1907, Preface, p. ix.) Finally, Professor James came\ntoward the end of his life to regard 'radical empiricism' as more\nfundamental and more important than 'pragmatism.' In the Preface to _The\nMeaning of Truth_ (1909), the author gives the following explanation of\nhis desire to continue, and if possible conclude, the controversy over\npragmatism: \"I am interested in another doctrine in philosophy to which\nI give the name of radical empiricism, and it seems to me that the\nestablishment of the pragmatist theory of truth is a step of first-rate\nimportance in making radical empiricism prevail\" (p. xii).\nIn preparing the present volume, the editor has therefore been governed\nby two motives. On the one hand, he has sought to preserve and make\naccessible certain important articles not to be found in Professor\nJames's other books. This is true of Essays I, II, IV, V, VIII, IX, X,\nXI, and XII. On the other hand, he has sought to bring together in one\nvolume a set of essays treating systematically of one independent,\ncoherent, and fundamental doctrine. To this end it has seemed best to\ninclude three essays (III, VI, and VII), which, although included in the\noriginal plan, were afterwards reprinted elsewhere; and one essay, XII,\nnot included in the original plan. Essays III, VI, and VII are\nindispensable to the consecutiveness of the series, and are so\ninterwoven with the rest that it is necessary that the student should\nhave them at hand for ready consultation. Essay XII throws an important\nlight on the author's general 'empiricism,' and forms an important link\nbetween 'radical empiricism' and the author's other doctrines.\nIn short, the present volume is designed not as a collection but rather\nas a treatise. It is intended that another volume shall be issued which\nshall contain papers having biographical or historical importance which\nhave not yet been reprinted in book form. The present volume is intended\nnot only for students of Professor James's philosophy, but for students\nof metaphysics and the theory of knowledge. It sets forth systematically\nand within brief compass the doctrine of 'radical empiricism.'\nA word more may be in order concerning the general meaning of this\ndoctrine. In the Preface to the _Will to Believe_ (1898), Professor\nJames gives the name \"_radical empiricism_\" to his \"philosophic\nattitude,\" and adds the following explanation: \"I say 'empiricism,'\nbecause it is contented to regard its most assured conclusions\nconcerning matters of fact as hypotheses liable to modification in the\ncourse of future experience; and I say 'radical,' because it treats the\ndoctrine of monism itself as an hypothesis, and, unlike so much of the\nhalfway empiricism that is current under the name of positivism or\nagnosticism or scientific naturalism, it does not dogmatically affirm\nmonism as something with which all experience has got to square\" (pp.\nvii-viii). An 'empiricism' of this description is a \"philosophic\nattitude\" or temper of mind rather than a doctrine, and characterizes\nall of Professor James's writings. It is set forth in Essay XII of the\npresent volume.\nIn a narrower sense, 'empiricism' is the method of resorting to\n_particular experiences_ for the solution of philosophical problems.\nRationalists are the men of principles, empiricists the men of facts.\n(_Some Problems of Philosophy_, p. 35; cf. also, _ibid._, p. 44; and\n_Pragmatism_, pp. 9, 51.) Or, \"since principles are universals, and\nfacts are particulars, perhaps the best way of characterizing the two\ntendencies is to say that rationalist thinking proceeds most willingly\nby going from wholes to parts, while empiricist thinking proceeds by\ngoing from parts to wholes.\" (_Some Problems of Philosophy_, p. 35; cf.\nalso _ibid._, p. 98; and _A Pluralistic Universe_, p. 7.) Again,\nempiricism \"remands us to sensation.\" (_Op. cit._, p. 264.) The\n\"empiricist view\" insists that, \"as reality is created temporally day by\nday, concepts ... can never fitly supersede perception.... The deeper\nfeatures of reality are found only in perceptual experience.\" (_Some\nProblems of Philosophy_, pp. 100, 97.) Empiricism in this sense is as\nyet characteristic of Professor James's philosophy _as a whole_. It is\nnot the distinctive and independent doctrine set forth in the present\nbook.\nThe only summary of 'radical empiricism' in this last and narrowest\nsense appears in the Preface to _The Meaning of Truth_ (pp. xii-xiii);\nand it must be reprinted here as the key to the text that follows.[1]\n\"Radical empiricism consists (1) first of a postulate, (2) next of a\nstatement of fact, (3) and finally of a generalized conclusion.\"\n(1) \"The postulate is that _the only things that shall be debatable\namong philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from\nexperience_. (Things of an unexperienceable nature may exist ad libitum,\nbut they form no part of the material for philosophic debate.)\" This is\n\"the principle of pure experience\" as \"a methodical postulate.\" (Cf.\nbelow, pp. 159, 241.) This postulate corresponds to the notion which the\nauthor repeatedly attributes to Shadworth Hodgson, the notion \"that\nrealities are only what they are 'known as.'\" (_Pragmatism_, p. 50;\n_Varieties of Religious Experience_, p. 443; _The Meaning of Truth_, pp.\n43, 118.) In this sense 'radical empiricism' and pragmatism are closely\nallied. Indeed, if pragmatism be defined as the assertion that \"the\nmeaning of any proposition can always be brought down to some particular\nconsequence in our future practical experience, ... the point lying in\nthe fact that the experience must be particular rather than in the fact\nthat it must be active\" (_Meaning of Truth_, p. 210); then pragmatism\nand the above postulate come to the same thing. The present book,\nhowever, consists not so much in the assertion of this postulate as in\nthe _use_ of it. And the method is successful in special applications by\nvirtue of a certain \"statement of fact\" concerning relations.\n(2) \"The statement of fact is that _the relations between things,\nconjunctive as well as disjunctive, are just as much matters of direct\nparticular experience, neither more so nor less so, than the things\nthemselves_.\" (Cf. also _A Pluralistic Universe_, p. 280; _The Will to\nBelieve_, p. 278.) This is the central doctrine of the present book. It\ndistinguishes 'radical empiricism' from the \"ordinary empiricism\" of\nHume, J. S. Mill, etc., with which it is otherwise allied. (Cf. below,\npp. 42-44.) It provides an empirical and relational version of\n'activity,' and so distinguishes the author's voluntarism from a view\nwith which it is easily confused--the view which upholds a pure or\ntranscendent activity. (Cf. below, Essay VI.) It makes it possible to\nescape the vicious disjunctions that have thus far baffled philosophy:\nsuch disjunctions as those between consciousness and physical nature,\nbetween thought and its object, between one mind and another, and\nbetween one 'thing' and another. These disjunctions need not be\n'overcome' by calling in any \"extraneous trans-empirical connective\nsupport\" (_Meaning of Truth_, Preface, p. xiii); they may now be\n_avoided_ by regarding the dualities in question as only _differences of\nempirical relationship among common empirical terms_. The pragmatistic\naccount of 'meaning' and 'truth,' shows only how a vicious disjunction\nbetween 'idea' and 'object' may thus be avoided. The present volume not\nonly presents pragmatism in this light; but adds similar accounts of the\nother dualities mentioned above.\nThus while pragmatism and radical empiricism do not differ essentially\nwhen regarded as _methods_, they are independent when regarded as\ndoctrines. For it would be possible to hold the pragmatistic theory of\n'meaning' and 'truth,' without basing it on any fundamental theory of\nrelations, and without extending such a theory of relations to residual\nphilosophical problems; without, in short, holding either to the above\n'statement of fact,' or to the following 'generalized conclusion.'\n(3) \"The generalized conclusion is that therefore _the parts of\nexperience hold together from next to next by relations that are\nthemselves parts of experience. The directly apprehended universe needs,\nin short, no extraneous trans-empirical connective support, but\npossesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous structure_.\"\nWhen thus generalized, 'radical empiricism' is not only a theory of\nknowledge comprising pragmatism as a special chapter, but a metaphysic\nas well. It excludes \"the hypothesis of trans-empirical reality\" (Cf.\nbelow, p. 195). It is the author's most rigorous statement of his theory\nthat reality is an \"experience-continuum.\" (_Meaning of Truth_, p. 152;\n_A Pluralistic Universe_, Lect. V, VII.) It is that positive and\nconstructive 'empiricism' of which Professor James said: \"Let empiricism\nonce become associated with religion, as hitherto, through some strange\nmisunderstanding, it has been associated with irreligion, and I believe\nthat a new era of religion as well as of philosophy will be ready to\nbegin.\" (_Op. cit._, p. 314; cf. _ibid._, Lect. VIII, _passim_; and _The\nVarieties of Religious Experience_, pp. 515-527.)\nThe editor desires to acknowledge his obligations to the periodicals\nfrom which these essays have been reprinted, and to the many friends of\nProfessor James who have rendered valuable advice and assistance in the\npreparation of the present volume.\nRALPH BARTON PERRY.\nCAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS.\nJanuary 8, 1912.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[1] The use of numerals and italics is introduced by the editor.\nCONTENTS\nI.

Philosophy, reflecting on the contrast, has varied in the\npast in her explanations of it, and may be expected to vary in the\nfuture. At first, 'spirit and matter,' 'soul and body,' stood for a pair\nof equipollent substances quite on a par in weight and interest. But one\nday Kant undermined the soul and brought in the transcendental ego, and\never since then the bipolar relation has been very much off its balance.\nThe transcendental ego seems nowadays in rationalist quarters to stand\nfor everything, in empiricist quarters for almost nothing. In the hands\nof such writers as Schuppe, Rehmke, Natorp, M\u00fcnsterberg--at any rate in\nhis earlier writings, Schubert-Soldern and others, the spiritual\nprinciple attenuates itself to a thoroughly ghostly condition, being\nonly a name for the fact that the 'content' of experience _is known_. It\nloses personal form and activity--these passing over to the content--and\nbecomes a bare _Bewusstheit_ or _Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt_, of which in its\nown right absolutely nothing can be said.\nI believe that 'consciousness,' when once it has evaporated to this\nestate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point of disappearing altogether.\nIt is the name of a nonentity, and has no right to a place among first\nprinciples. Those who still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo, the\nfaint rumor left behind by the disappearing 'soul' upon the air of\nphilosophy. During the past year, I have read a number of articles whose\nauthors seemed just on the point of abandoning the notion of\nconsciousness,[3] and substituting for it that of an absolute experience\nnot due to two factors. But they were not quite radical enough, not\nquite daring enough in their negations. For twenty years past I have\nmistrusted 'consciousness' as an entity; for seven or eight years past I\nhave suggested its non-existence to my students, and tried to give them\nits pragmatic equivalent in realities of experience. It seems to me that\nthe hour is ripe for it to be openly and universally discarded.\nTo deny plumply that 'consciousness' exists seems so absurd on the face\nof it--for undeniably 'thoughts' do exist--that I fear some readers will\nfollow me no farther. Let me then immediately explain that I mean only\nto deny that the word stands for an entity, but to insist most\nemphatically that it does stand for a function. There is, I mean, no\naboriginal stuff or quality of being,[4] contrasted with that of which\nmaterial objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are made;\nbut there is a function in experience which thoughts perform, and for\nthe performance of which this quality of being is invoked. That\nfunction is _knowing_. 'Consciousness' is supposed necessary to explain\nthe fact that things not only are, but get reported, are known. Whoever\nblots out the notion of consciousness from his list of first principles\nmust still provide in some way for that function's being carried on.\nI\nMy thesis is that if we start with the supposition that there is only\none primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything\nis composed, and if we call that stuff 'pure experience,' then knowing\ncan easily be explained as a particular sort of relation towards one\nanother into which portions of pure experience may enter. The relation\nitself is a part of pure experience; one of its 'terms' becomes the\nsubject or bearer of the knowledge, the knower,[5] the other becomes the\nobject known. This will need much explanation before it can be\nunderstood. The best way to get it understood is to contrast it with the\nalternative view; and for that we may take the recentest alternative,\nthat in which the evaporation of the definite soul-substance has\nproceeded as far as it can go without being yet complete. If neo-Kantism\nhas expelled earlier forms of dualism, we shall have expelled all forms\nif we are able to expel neo-Kantism in its turn.\nFor the thinkers I call neo-Kantian, the word consciousness to-day does\nno more than signalize the fact that experience is indefeasibly\ndualistic in structure. It means that not subject, not object, but\nobject-plus-subject is the minimum that can actually be. The\nsubject-object distinction meanwhile is entirely different from that\nbetween mind and matter, from that between body and soul. Souls were\ndetachable, had separate destinies; things could happen to them. To\nconsciousness as such nothing can happen, for, timeless itself, it is\nonly a witness of happenings in time, in which it plays no part. It is,\nin a word, but the logical correlative of 'content' in an Experience of\nwhich the peculiarity is that _fact comes to light_ in it, that\n_awareness of content_ takes place. Consciousness as such is entirely\nimpersonal--'self' and its activities belong to the content. To say that\nI am self-conscious, or conscious of putting forth volition, means only\nthat certain contents, for which 'self' and 'effort of will' are the\nnames, are not without witness as they occur.\nThus, for these belated drinkers at the Kantian spring, we should have\nto admit consciousness as an 'epistemological' necessity, even if we had\nno direct evidence of its being there.\nBut in addition to this, we are supposed by almost every one to have an\nimmediate consciousness of consciousness itself. When the world of outer\nfact ceases to be materially present, and we merely recall it in memory,\nor fancy it, the consciousness is believed to stand out and to be felt\nas a kind of impalpable inner flowing, which, once known in this sort of\nexperience, may equally be detected in presentations of the outer world.\n\"The moment we try to fix our attention upon consciousness and to see\n_what_, distinctly, it is,\" says a recent writer, \"it seems to vanish.\nIt seems as if we had before us a mere emptiness. When we try to\nintrospect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue; the other\nelement is as if it were diaphanous. Yet it _can_ be distinguished, if\nwe look attentively enough, and know that there is something to look\nfor.\"[6] \"Consciousness\" (Bewusstheit), says another philosopher, \"is\ninexplicable and hardly describable, yet all conscious experiences have\nthis in common that what we call their content has this peculiar\nreference to a centre for which 'self' is the name, in virtue of which\nreference alone the content is subjectively given, or appears ... While\nin this way consciousness, or reference to a self, is the only thing\nwhich distinguishes a conscious content from any sort of being that\nmight be there with no one conscious of it, yet this only ground of the\ndistinction defies all closer explanations. The existence of\nconsciousness, although it is the fundamental fact of psychology, can\nindeed be laid down as certain, can be brought out by analysis, but can\nneither be defined nor deduced from anything but itself.\"[7]\n'Can be brought out by analysis,' this author says. This supposes that\nthe consciousness is one element, moment, factor--call it what you\nlike--of an experience of essentially dualistic inner constitution, from\nwhich, if you abstract the content, the consciousness will remain\nrevealed to its own eye. Experience, at this rate, would be much like a\npaint of which the world pictures were made. Paint has a dual\nconstitution, involving, as it does, a menstruum[8] (oil, size or what\nnot) and a mass of content in the form of pigment suspended therein. We\ncan get the pure menstruum by letting the pigment settle, and the pure\npigment by pouring off the size or oil. We operate here by physical\nsubtraction; and the usual view is, that by mental subtraction we can\nseparate the two factors of experience in an analogous way--not\nisolating them entirely, but distinguishing them enough to know that\nthey are two.\nII\nNow my contention is exactly the reverse of this. _Experience, I\nbelieve, has no such inner duplicity; and the separation of it into\nconsciousness and content comes, not by way of subtraction, but by way\nof addition_--the addition, to a given concrete piece of it, of other\nsets of experiences, in connection with which severally its use or\nfunction may be of two different kinds. The paint will also serve here\nas an illustration. In a pot in a paint-shop, along with other paints,\nit serves in its entirety as so much saleable matter. Spread on a\ncanvas, with other paints around it, it represents, on the contrary, a\nfeature in a picture and performs a spiritual function. Just so, I\nmaintain, does a given undivided portion of experience, taken in one\ncontext of associates, play the part of a knower, of a state of mind, of\n'consciousness'; while in a different context the same undivided bit of\nexperience plays the part of a thing known, of an objective 'content.'\nIn a word, in one group it figures as a thought, in another group as a\nthing. And, since it can figure in both groups simultaneously we have\nevery right to speak of it as subjective and objective both at once. The\ndualism connoted by such double-barrelled terms as 'experience,'\n'phenomenon,' 'datum,' '_Vorfindung_'--terms which, in philosophy at any\nrate, tend more and more to replace the single-barrelled terms of\n'thought' and 'thing'--that dualism, I say, is still preserved in this\naccount, but reinterpreted, so that, instead of being mysterious and\nelusive, it becomes verifiable and concrete. It is an affair of\nrelations, it falls outside, not inside, the single experience\nconsidered, and can always be particularized and defined.\nThe entering wedge for this more concrete way of understanding the\ndualism was fashioned by Locke when he made the word 'idea' stand\nindifferently for thing and thought, and by Berkeley when he said that\nwhat common sense means by realities is exactly what the philosopher\nmeans by ideas. Neither Locke nor Berkeley thought his truth out into\nperfect clearness, but it seems to me that the conception I am defending\ndoes little more than consistently carry out the 'pragmatic' method\nwhich they were the first to use.\nIf the reader will take his own experiences, he will see what I mean.\nLet him begin with a perceptual experience, the 'presentation,' so\ncalled, of a physical object, his actual field of vision, the room he\nsits in, with the book he is reading as its centre; and let him for the\npresent treat this complex object in the common-sense way as being\n'really' what it seems to be, namely, a collection of physical things\ncut out from an environing world of other physical things with which\nthese physical things have actual or potential relations. Now at the\nsame time it is just _those self-same things_ which his mind, as we say,\nperceives; and the whole philosophy of perception from Democritus's time\ndownwards has been just one long wrangle over the paradox that what is\nevidently one reality should be in two places at once, both in outer\nspace and in a person's mind. 'Representative' theories of perception\navoid the logical paradox, but on the other hand they violate the\nreader's sense of life, which knows no intervening mental image but\nseems to see the room and the book immediately just as they physically\nexist.\nThe puzzle of how the one identical room can be in two places is at\nbottom just the puzzle of how one identical point can be on two lines.\nIt can, if it be situated at their intersection; and similarly, if the\n'pure experience' of the room were a place of intersection of two\nprocesses, which connected it with different groups of associates\nrespectively, it could be counted twice over, as belonging to either\ngroup, and spoken of loosely as existing in two places, although it\nwould remain all the time a numerically single thing.\nWell, the experience is a member of diverse processes that can be\nfollowed away from it along entirely different lines. The one\nself-identical thing has so many relations to the rest of experience\nthat you can take it in disparate systems of association, and treat it\nas belonging with opposite contexts.[9] In one of these contexts it is\nyour 'field of consciousness'; in another it is 'the room in which you\nsit,' and it enters both contexts in its wholeness, giving no pretext\nfor being said to attach itself to consciousness by one of its parts or\naspects, and to outer reality by another. What are the two processes,\nnow, into which the room-experience simultaneously enters in this way?\nOne of them is the reader's personal biography, the other is the history\nof the house of which the room is part. The presentation, the\nexperience, the _that_ in short (for until we have decided _what_ it is\nit must be a mere _that_) is the last term of a train of sensations,\nemotions, decisions, movements, classifications, expectations, etc.,\nending in the present, and the first term of a series of similar 'inner'\noperations extending into the future, on the reader's part. On the other\nhand, the very same _that_ is the _terminus ad quem_ of a lot of\nprevious physical operations, carpentering, papering, furnishing,\nwarming, etc., and the _terminus a quo_ of a lot of future ones, in\nwhich it will be concerned when undergoing the destiny of a physical\nroom. The physical and the mental operations form curiously incompatible\ngroups. As a room, the experience has occupied that spot and had that\nenvironment for thirty years. As your field of consciousness it may\nnever have existed until now. As a room, attention will go on to\ndiscover endless new details in it. As your mental state merely, few new\nones will emerge under attention's eye. As a room, it will take an\nearthquake, or a gang of men, and in any case a certain amount of time,\nto destroy it. As your subjective state, the closing of your eyes, or\nany instantaneous play of your fancy will suffice. In the real world,\nfire will consume it. In your mind, you can let fire play over it\nwithout effect. As an outer object, you must pay so much a month to\ninhabit it. As an inner content, you may occupy it for any length of\ntime rent-free. If, in short, you follow it in the mental direction,\ntaking it along with events of personal biography solely, all sorts of\nthings are true of it which are false, and false of it which are true if\nyou treat it as a real thing experienced, follow it in the physical\ndirection, and relate it to associates in the outer world.\nIII\nSo far, all seems plain sailing, but my thesis will probably grow less\nplausible to the reader when I pass from percepts to concepts, or from\nthe case of things presented to that of things remote. I believe,\nnevertheless, that here also the same law holds good. If we take\nconceptual manifolds, or memories, or fancies, they also are in their\nfirst intention mere bits of pure experience, and, as such, are single\n_thats_ which act in one context as objects, and in another context\nfigure as mental states. By taking them in their first intention, I mean\nignoring their relation to possible perceptual experiences with which\nthey may be connected, which they may lead to and terminate in, and\nwhich then they may be supposed to 'represent.' Taking them in this way\nfirst, we confine the problem to a world merely 'thought-of' and not\ndirectly felt or seen.[10] This world, just like the world of percepts,\ncomes to us at first as a chaos of experiences, but lines of order soon\nget traced. We find that any bit of it which we may cut out as an\nexample is connected with distinct groups of associates, just as our\nperceptual experiences are, that these associates link themselves with\nit by different relations,[11] and that one forms the inner history of a\nperson, while the other acts as an impersonal 'objective' world, either\nspatial and temporal, or else merely logical or mathematical, or\notherwise 'ideal.'\nThe first obstacle on the part of the reader to seeing that these\nnon-perceptual experiences have objectivity as well as subjectivity will\nprobably be due to the intrusion into his mind of _percepts_, that third\ngroup of associates with which the non-perceptual experiences have\nrelations, and which, as a whole, they 'represent,' standing to them as\nthoughts to things. This important function of the non-perceptual\nexperiences complicates the question and confuses it; for, so used are\nwe to treat percepts as the sole genuine realities that, unless we keep\nthem out of the discussion, we tend altogether to overlook the\nobjectivity that lies in non-perceptual experiences by themselves. We\ntreat them, 'knowing' percepts as they do, as through and through\nsubjective, and say that they are wholly constituted of the stuff called\nconsciousness, using this term now for a kind of entity, after the\nfashion which I am seeking to refute.[12]\nAbstracting, then, from percepts altogether, what I maintain is, that\nany single non-perceptual experience tends to get counted twice over,\njust as a perceptual experience does, figuring in one context as an\nobject or field of objects, in another as a state of mind: and all this\nwithout the least internal self-diremption on its own part into\nconsciousness and content. It is all consciousness in one taking; and,\nin the other, all content.\nI find this objectivity of non-perceptual experiences, this complete\nparallelism in point of reality between the presently felt and the\nremotely thought, so well set forth in a page of M\u00fcnsterberg's\n_Grundz\u00fcge_, that I will quote it as it stands.\n\"I may only think of my objects,\" says Professor M\u00fcnsterberg; \"yet, in\nmy living thought they stand before me exactly as perceived objects\nwould do, no matter how different the two ways of apprehending them may\nbe in their genesis. The book here lying on the table before me, and the\nbook in the next room of which I think and which I mean to get, are both\nin the same sense given realities for me, realities which I acknowledge\nand of which I take account. If you agree that the perceptual object is\nnot an idea within me, but that percept and thing, as indistinguishably\none, are really experienced _there, outside_, you ought not to believe\nthat the merely thought-of object is hid away inside of the thinking\nsubject. The object of which I think, and of whose existence I take\ncognizance without letting it now work upon my senses, occupies its\ndefinite place in the outer world as much as does the object which I\ndirectly see.\"\n\"What is true of the here and the there, is also true of the now and the\nthen. I know of the thing which is present and perceived, but I know\nalso of the thing which yesterday was but is no more, and which I only\nremember. Both can determine my present conduct, both are parts of the\nreality of which I keep account. It is true that of much of the past I\nam uncertain, just as I am uncertain of much of what is present if it be\nbut dimly perceived. But the interval of time does not in principle\nalter my relation to the object, does not transform it from an object\nknown into a mental state.... The things in the room here which I\nsurvey, and those in my distant home of which I think, the things of\nthis minute and those of my long-vanished boyhood, influence and decide\nme alike, with a reality which my experience of them directly feels.\nThey both make up my real world, they make it directly, they do not have\nfirst to be introduced to me and mediated by ideas which now and here\narise within me.... This not-me character of my recollections and\nexpectations does not imply that the external objects of which I am\naware in those experiences should necessarily be there also for others.\nThe objects of dreamers and hallucinated persons are wholly without\ngeneral validity. But even were they centaurs and golden mountains, they\nstill would be 'off there,' in fairy land, and not 'inside' of\nourselves.\"[13]\nThis certainly is the immediate, primary, na\u00eff, or practical way of\ntaking our thought-of world. Were there no perceptual world to serve as\nits 'reductive,' in Taine's sense, by being 'stronger' and more\ngenuinely 'outer' (so that the whole merely thought-of world seems weak\nand inner in comparison), our world of thought would be the only world,\nand would enjoy complete reality in our belief. This actually happens in\nour dreams, and in our day-dreams so long as percepts do not interrupt\nthem.\nAnd yet, just as the seen room (to go back to our late example) is\n_also_ a field of consciousness, so the conceived or recollected room is\n_also_ a state of mind; and the doubling-up of the experience has in\nboth cases similar grounds.\nThe room thought-of, namely, has many thought-of couplings with many\nthought-of things. Some of these couplings are inconstant, others are\nstable. In the reader's personal history the room occupies a single\ndate--he saw it only once perhaps, a year ago. Of the house's history,\non the other hand, it forms a permanent ingredient. Some couplings\nhave the curious stubbornness, to borrow Royce's term, of fact; others\nshow the fluidity of fancy--we let them come and go as we please.\nGrouped with the rest of its house, with the name of its town, of its\nowner, builder, value, decorative plan, the room maintains a definite\nfoothold, to which, if we try to loosen it, it tends to return, and to\nreassert itself with force.[14] With these associates, in a word, it\ncoheres, while to other houses, other towns, other owners, etc., it\nshows no tendency to cohere at all. The two collections, first of its\ncohesive, and, second, of its loose associates, inevitably come to be\ncontrasted. We call the first collection the system of external\nrealities, in the midst of which the room, as 'real,' exists; the\nother we call the stream of our internal thinking, in which, as a\n'mental image,' it for a moment floats.[15] The room thus again gets\ncounted twice over. It plays two different r\u00f4les, being _Gedanke_ and\n_Gedachtes_, the thought-of-an-object, and the object-thought-of, both\nin one; and all this without paradox or mystery, just as the same\nmaterial thing may be both low and high, or small and great, or bad\nand good, because of its relations to opposite parts of an environing\nworld.\nAs 'subjective' we say that the experience represents; as 'objective'\nit is represented. What represents and what is represented is here\nnumerically the same; but we must remember that no dualism of being\nrepresented and representing resides in the experience _per se_. In its\npure state, or when isolated, there is no self-splitting of it into\nconsciousness and what the consciousness is 'of.' Its subjectivity and\nobjectivity are functional attributes solely, realized only when the\nexperience is 'taken,' _i.e._, talked-of, twice, considered along with\nits two differing contexts respectively, by a new retrospective\nexperience, of which that whole past complication now forms the fresh\ncontent.\nThe instant field of the present is at all times what I call the 'pure'\nexperience. It is only virtually or potentially either object or subject\nas yet. For the time being, it is plain, unqualified actuality, or\nexistence, a simple _that_. In this _na\u00eff_ immediacy it is of course\n_valid_; it is _there_, we _act_ upon it; and the doubling of it in\nretrospection into a state of mind and a reality intended thereby, is\njust one of the acts. The 'state of mind,' first treated explicitly as\nsuch in retrospection, will stand corrected or confirmed, and the\nretrospective experience in its turn will get a similar treatment; but\nthe immediate experience in its passing is always 'truth,'[16] practical\ntruth, _something to act on_, at its own movement. If the world were\nthen and there to go out like a candle, it would remain truth absolute\nand objective, for it would be 'the last word,' would have no critic,\nand no one would ever oppose the thought in it to the reality\nintended.[17]\nI think I may now claim to have made my thesis clear. Consciousness\nconnotes a kind of external relation, and does not denote a special\nstuff or way of being. _The peculiarity of our experiences, that they\nnot only are, but are known, which their 'conscious' quality is invoked\nto explain, is better explained by their relations--these relations\nthemselves being experiences--to one another._\nIV\nWere I now to go on to treat of the knowing of perceptual by conceptual\nexperiences, it would again prove to be an affair of external relations.\nOne experience would be the knower, the other the reality known; and I\ncould perfectly well define, without the notion of 'consciousness,' what\nthe knowing actually and practically amounts to--leading-towards,\nnamely, and terminating-in percepts, through a series of transitional\nexperiences which the world supplies. But I will not treat of this,\nspace being insufficient.[18] I will rather consider a few objections\nthat are sure to be urged against the entire theory as it stands.\nV\nFirst of all, this will be asked: \"If experience has not 'conscious'\nexistence, if it be not partly made of 'consciousness,' of what then is\nit made? Matter we know, and thought we know, and conscious content we\nknow, but neutral and simple 'pure experience' is something we know not\nat all. Say _what_ it consists of--for it must consist of something--or\nbe willing to give it up!\"\nTo this challenge the reply is easy. Although for fluency's sake I\nmyself spoke early in this article of a stuff of pure experience, I have\nnow to say that there is no _general_ stuff of which experience at large\nis made. There are as many stuffs as there are 'natures' in the things\nexperienced. If you ask what any one bit of pure experience is made of,\nthe answer is always the same: \"It is made of _that_, of just what\nappears, of space, of intensity, of flatness, brownness, heaviness, or\nwhat not.\" Shadworth Hodgson's analysis here leaves nothing to be\ndesired.[19] Experience is only a collective name for all these sensible\nnatures, and save for time and space (and, if you like, for 'being')\nthere appears no universal element of which all things are made.\nVI\nThe next objection is more formidable, in fact it sounds quite crushing\nwhen one hears it first.\n\"If it be the self-same piece of pure experience, taken twice over, that\nserves now as thought and now as thing\"--so the objection runs--\"how\ncomes it that its attributes should differ so fundamentally in the two\ntakings. As thing, the experience is extended; as thought, it occupies\nno space or place. As thing, it is red, hard, heavy; but who ever heard\nof a red, hard or heavy thought? Yet even now you said that an\nexperience is made of just what appears, and what appears is just such\nadjectives. How can the one experience in its thing-function be made of\nthem, consist of them, carry them as its own attributes, while in its\nthought-function it disowns them and attributes them elsewhere. There is\na self-contradiction here from which the radical dualism of thought and\nthing is the only truth that can save us. Only if the thought is one\nkind of being can the adjectives exist in it 'intentionally' (to use the\nscholastic term); only if the thing is another kind, can they exist in\nit constitutively and energetically. No simple subject can take the same\nadjectives and at one time be qualified by it, and at another time be\nmerely 'of' it, as of something only meant or known.\"\nThe solution insisted on by this objector, like many other common-sense\nsolutions, grows the less satisfactory the more one turns it in one's\nmind. To begin with, _are_ thought and thing as heterogeneous as is\ncommonly said?\nNo one denies that they have some categories in common. Their relations\nto time are identical. Both, moreover, may have parts (for psychologists\nin general treat thoughts as having them); and both may be complex or\nsimple. Both are of kinds, can be compared, added and subtracted and\narranged in serial orders. All sorts of adjectives qualify our thoughts\nwhich appear incompatible with consciousness, being as such a bare\ndiaphaneity. For instance, they are natural and easy, or laborious. They\nare beautiful, happy, intense, interesting, wise, idiotic, focal,\nmarginal, insipid, confused, vague, precise, rational, casual, general,\nparticular, and many things besides. Moreover, the chapters on\n'Perception' in the psychology-books are full of facts that make for the\nessential homogeneity of thought with thing. How, if 'subject' and\n'object' were separated 'by the whole diameter of being,' and had no\nattributes in common, could it be so hard to tell, in a presented and\nrecognized material object, what part comes in through the sense-organs\nand what part comes 'out of one's own head'? Sensations and\napperceptive ideas fuse here so intimately that you can no more tell\nwhere one begins and the other ends, than you can tell, in those cunning\ncircular panoramas that have lately been exhibited, where the real\nforeground and the painted canvas join together.[20]\nDescartes for the first time defined thought as the absolutely\nunextended, and later philosophers have accepted the description as\ncorrect. But what possible meaning has it to say that, when we think of\na foot-rule or a square yard, extension is not attributable to our\nthought? Of every extended object the _adequate_ mental picture must\nhave all the extension of the object itself. The difference between\nobjective and subjective extension is one of relation to a context\nsolely. In the mind the various extents maintain no necessarily stubborn\norder relatively to each other, while in the physical world they bound\neach other stably, and, added together, make the great enveloping Unit\nwhich we believe in and call real Space. As 'outer,' they carry\nthemselves adversely, so to speak, to one another, exclude one another\nand maintain their distances; while, as 'inner,' their order is loose,\nand they form a _durcheinander_ in which unity is lost.[21] But to argue\nfrom this that inner experience is absolutely inextensive seems to me\nlittle short of absurd. The two worlds differ, not by the presence or\nabsence of extension, but by the relations of the extensions which in\nboth worlds exist.\nDoes not this case of extension now put us on the track of truth in the\ncase of other qualities? It does; and I am surprised that the facts\nshould not have been noticed long ago. Why, for example, do we call a\nfire hot, and water wet, and yet refuse to say that our mental state,\nwhen it is 'of' these objects, is either wet or hot? 'Intentionally,' at\nany rate, and when the mental state is a vivid image, hotness and\nwetness are in it just as much as they are in the physical experience.\nThe reason is this, that, as the general chaos of all our experiences\ngets sifted, we find that there are some fires that will always burn\nsticks and always warm our bodies, and that there are some waters that\nwill always put out fires; while there are other fires and waters that\nwill not act at all. The general group of experiences that _act_, that\ndo not only possess their natures intrinsically, but wear them\nadjectively and energetically, turning them against one another, comes\ninevitably to be contrasted with the group whose members, having\nidentically the same natures, fail to manifest them in the 'energetic'\nway.[22] I make for myself now an experience of blazing fire; I place it\nnear my body; but it does not warm me in the least. I lay a stick upon\nit, and the stick either burns or remains green, as I please. I call up\nwater, and pour it on the fire, and absolutely no difference ensues. I\naccount for all such facts by calling this whole train of experiences\nunreal, a mental train. Mental fire is what won't burn real sticks;\nmental water is what won't necessarily (though of course it may) put out\neven a mental fire. Mental knives may be sharp, but they won't cut real\nwood. Mental triangles are pointed, but their points won't wound. With\n'real' objects, on the contrary, consequences always accrue; and thus\nthe real experiences get sifted from the mental ones, the things from\nour thoughts of them, fanciful or true, and precipitated together as the\nstable part of the whole experience-chaos, under the name of the\nphysical world. Of this our perceptual experiences are the nucleus, they\nbeing the originally strong experiences. We add a lot of conceptual\nexperiences to them, making these strong also in imagination, and\nbuilding out the remoter parts of the physical world by their means; and\naround this core of reality the world of laxly connected fancies and\nmere rhapsodical objects floats like a bank of clouds. In the clouds,\nall sorts of rules are violated which in the core are kept. Extensions\nthere can be indefinitely located; motion there obeys no Newton's laws.\nVII\nThere is a peculiar class of experiences to which, whether we take them\nas subjective or as objective, we _assign_ their several natures as\nattributes, because in both contexts they affect their associates\nactively, though in neither quite as 'strongly' or as sharply as things\naffect one another by their physical energies. I refer here to\n_appreciations_, which form an ambiguous sphere of being, belonging with\nemotion on the one hand, and having objective 'value' on the other, yet\nseeming not quite inner nor quite outer, as if a diremption had begun\nbut had not made itself complete.[23]\nExperiences of painful objects, for example, are usually also painful\nexperiences; perceptions of loveliness, of ugliness, tend to pass muster\nas lovely or as ugly perceptions; intuitions of the morally lofty are\nlofty intuitions. Sometimes the adjective wanders as if uncertain where\nto fix itself. Shall we speak of seductive visions or of visions of\nseductive things? Of wicked desires or of desires for wickedness? Of\nhealthy thoughts or of thoughts of healthy objects? Of good impulses, or\nof impulses towards the good? Of feelings of anger, or of angry\nfeelings? Both in the mind and in the thing, these natures modify their\ncontext, exclude certain associates and determine others, have their\nmates and incompatibles. Yet not as stubbornly as in the case of\nphysical qualities, for beauty and ugliness, love and hatred, pleasant\nand painful can, in certain complex experiences, coexist.\nIf one were to make an evolutionary construction of how a lot of\noriginally chaotic pure experiences became gradually differentiated into\nan orderly inner and outer world, the whole theory would turn upon one's\nsuccess in explaining how or why the quality of an experience, once\nactive, could become less so, and, from being an energetic attribute in\nsome cases, elsewhere lapse into the status of an inert or merely\ninternal 'nature.' This would be the 'evolution' of the psychical from\nthe bosom of the physical, in which the esthetic, moral and otherwise\nemotional experiences would represent a halfway stage.\nVIII\nBut a last cry of _non possumus_ will probably go up from many readers.\n\"All very pretty as a piece of ingenuity,\" they will say, \"but our\nconsciousness itself intuitively contradicts you. We, for our part,\n_know_ that we are conscious. We _feel_ our thought, flowing as a life\nwithin us, in absolute contrast with the objects which it so\nunremittingly escorts. We can not be faithless to this immediate\nintuition. The dualism is a fundamental _datum_: Let no man join what\nGod has put asunder.\"\nMy reply to this is my last word, and I greatly grieve that to many it\nwill sound materialistic. I can not help that, however, for I, too, have\nmy intuitions and I must obey them. Let the case be what it may in\nothers, I am as confident as I am of anything that, in myself, the\nstream of thinking (which I recognize emphatically as a phenomenon) is\nonly a careless name for what, when scrutinized, reveals itself to\nconsist chiefly of the stream of my breathing. The 'I think' which Kant\nsaid must be able to accompany all my objects, is the 'I breathe' which\nactually does accompany them. There are other internal facts besides\nbreathing (intracephalic muscular adjustments, etc., of which I have\nsaid a word in my larger Psychology), and these increase the assets of\n'consciousness,' so far as the latter is subject to immediate\nperception;[24] but breath, which was ever the original of 'spirit,'\nbreath moving outwards, between the glottis and the nostrils, is, I am\npersuaded, the essence out of which philosophers have constructed the\nentity known to them as consciousness. _That entity is fictitious, while\nthoughts in the concrete are fully real. But thoughts in the concrete\nare made of the same stuff as things are._\nI wish I might believe myself to have made that plausible in this\narticle. In another article I shall try to make the general notion of a\nworld composed of pure experiences still more clear.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[2] [Reprinted from the _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Perry has\npublished a view of Consciousness which comes nearer to mine than any\nother with which I am acquainted. At present, Dr. Perry thinks, every\nfield of experience is so much 'fact.' It becomes 'opinion' or 'thought'\nonly in retrospection, when a fresh experience, thinking the same\nobject, alters and corrects it. But the corrective experience becomes\nitself in turn corrected, and thus experience as a whole is a process in\nwhich what is objective originally forever turns subjective, turns into\nour apprehension of the object. I strongly recommend Dr. Perry's\nadmirable article to my readers.\n[18] I have given a partial account of the matter in _Mind_, vol. X, p.\n27, 1885 [reprinted in _The Meaning of Truth_, pp. 1-42], and in the\n_Psychological Review_, vol. II, p. 105, 1895 [partly reprinted in _The\nMeaning of Truth_, pp. 43-50]. See also C. A. Strong's article in the\n_Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods_, vol. I, p.\n253, May 12, 1904. I hope myself very soon to recur to the matter. [See\nbelow, pp. 52 ff.]\n[19] [Cf. Shadworth Hodgson: _The Metaphysic of Experience_, vol. I.\n_passim;_ _The Philosophy of Reflection_, bk. II, ch. IV, \u00a7 3.

All his painfully accumulated points of\ndifference run gradually into their opposites, and are full of\nexceptions. [Cf. Spencer: _Principles of Psychology_, part VII, ch.\nXIX.]\n[21] I speak here of the complete inner life in which the mind plays\nfreely with its materials. Of course the mind's free play is restricted\nwhen it seeks to copy real things in real space.\n[22] [But there are also \"mental activity trains,\" in which thoughts do\n\"work on each other.\" Cf. below, p. 184, note.

The dissatisfaction with these seems due for the most\npart to a feeling that they are too abstract and academic. Life is\nconfused and superabundant, and what the younger generation appears to\ncrave is more of the temperament of life in its philosophy, even though\nit were at some cost of logical rigor and of formal purity.\nTranscendental idealism is inclining to let the world wag\nincomprehensibly, in spite of its Absolute Subject and his unity of\npurpose. Berkeleyan idealism is abandoning the principle of parsimony\nand dabbling in panpsychic speculations. Empiricism flirts with\nteleology; and, strangest of all, natural realism, so long decently\nburied, raises its head above the turf, and finds glad hands\noutstretched from the most unlikely quarters to help it to its feet\nagain. We are all biased by our personal feelings, I know, and I am\npersonally discontented with extant solutions; so I seem to read the\nsigns of a great unsettlement, as if the upheaval of more real\nconceptions and more fruitful methods were imminent, as if a true\nlandscape might result, less clipped, straight-edged and artificial.\nIf philosophy be really on the eve of any considerable rearrangement,\nthe time should be propitious for any one who has suggestions of his own\nto bring forward. For many years past my mind has been growing into a\ncertain type of _Weltanschauung_. Rightly or wrongly, I have got to the\npoint where I can hardly see things in any other pattern. I propose,\ntherefore, to describe the pattern as clearly as I can consistently with\ngreat brevity, and to throw my description into the bubbling vat of\npublicity where, jostled by rivals and torn by critics, it will\neventually either disappear from notice, or else, if better luck befall\nit, quietly subside to the profundities, and serve as a possible ferment\nof new growths or a nucleus of new crystallization.\nI. RADICAL EMPIRICISM\nI give the name of 'radical empiricism' to my _Weltanschauung_.\nEmpiricism is known as the opposite of rationalism. Rationalism tends to\nemphasize universals and to make wholes prior to parts in the order of\nlogic as well as in that of being. Empiricism, on the contrary, lays the\nexplanatory stress upon the part, the element, the individual, and\ntreats the whole as a collection and the universal as an abstraction. My\ndescription of things, accordingly, starts with the parts and makes of\nthe whole a being of the second order. It is essentially a mosaic\nphilosophy, a philosophy of plural facts, like that of Hume and his\ndescendants, who refer these facts neither to Substances in which they\ninhere nor to an Absolute Mind that creates them as its objects. But it\ndiffers from the Humian type of empiricism in one particular which makes\nme add the epithet radical.\nTo be radical, an empiricism must neither admit into its constructions\nany element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them any\nelement that is directly experienced. For such a philosophy, _the\nrelations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced\nrelations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as\n'real' as anything else in the system_. Elements may indeed be\nredistributed, the original placing of things getting corrected, but a\nreal place must be found for every kind of thing experienced, whether\nterm or relation, in the final philosophic arrangement.\nNow, ordinary empiricism, in spite of the fact that conjunctive and\ndisjunctive relations present themselves as being fully co-ordinate\nparts of experience, has always shown a tendency to do away with the\nconnections of things, and to insist most on the disjunctions.\nBerkeley's nominalism, Hume's statement that whatever things we\ndistinguish are as 'loose and separate' as if they had 'no manner of\nconnection,' James Mill's denial that similars have anything 'really' in\ncommon, the resolution of the causal tie into habitual sequence, John\nMill's account of both physical things and selves as composed of\ndiscontinuous possibilities, and the general pulverization of all\nExperience by association and the mind-dust theory, are examples of what\nI mean.[26]\nThe natural result of such a world-picture has been the efforts of\nrationalism to correct its incoherencies by the addition of\ntrans-experiential agents of unification, substances, intellectual\ncategories and powers, or Selves; whereas, if empiricism had only been\nradical and taken everything that comes without disfavor, conjunction as\nwell as separation, each at its face value, the results would have\ncalled for no such artificial correction. _Radical empiricism_, as I\nunderstand it, _does full justice to conjunctive relations_, without,\nhowever, treating them as rationalism always tends to treat them, as\nbeing true in some supernal way, as if the unity of things and their\nvariety belonged to different orders of truth and vitality altogether.\nII. CONJUNCTIVE RELATIONS\nRelations are of different degrees of intimacy. Merely to be 'with' one\nanother in a universe of discourse is the most external relation that\nterms can have, and seems to involve nothing whatever as to farther\nconsequences. Simultaneity and time-interval come next, and then\nspace-adjacency and distance. After them, similarity and difference,\ncarrying the possibility of many inferences. Then relations of activity,\ntying terms into series involving change, tendency, resistance, and the\ncausal order generally. Finally, the relation experienced between terms\nthat form states of mind, and are immediately conscious of continuing\neach other. The organization of the Self as a system of memories,\npurposes, strivings, fulfilments or disappointments, is incidental to\nthis most intimate of all relations, the terms of which seem in many\ncases actually to compenetrate and suffuse each other's being.[27]\nPhilosophy has always turned on grammatical particles. With, near, next,\nlike, from, towards, against, because, for, through, my--these words\ndesignate types of conjunctive relation arranged in a roughly ascending\norder of intimacy and inclusiveness. _A priori_, we can imagine a\nuniverse of withness but no nextness; or one of nextness but no\nlikeness, or of likeness with no activity, or of activity with no\npurpose, or of purpose with no ego. These would be universes, each with\nits own grade of unity. The universe of human experience is, by one or\nanother of its parts, of each and all these grades. Whether or not it\npossibly enjoys some still more absolute grade of union does not appear\nupon the surface.\nTaken as it does appear, our universe is to a large extent chaotic. No\none single type of connection runs through all the experiences that\ncompose it. If we take space-relations, they fail to connect minds into\nany regular system. Causes and purposes obtain only among special series\nof facts. The self-relation seems extremely limited and does not link\ntwo different selves together. _Prima facie_, if you should liken the\nuniverse of absolute idealism to an aquarium, a crystal globe in which\ngoldfish are swimming, you would have to compare the empiricist universe\nto something more like one of those dried human heads with which the\nDyaks of Borneo deck their lodges. The skull forms a solid nucleus; but\ninnumerable feathers, leaves, strings, beads, and loose appendices of\nevery description float and dangle from it, and, save that they\nterminate in it, seem to have nothing to do with one another. Even so my\nexperiences and yours float and dangle, terminating, it is true, in a\nnucleus of common perception, but for the most part out of sight and\nirrelevant and unimaginable to one another. This imperfect intimacy,\nthis bare relation of _withness_ between some parts of the sum total of\nexperience and other parts, is the fact that ordinary empiricism\nover-emphasizes against rationalism, the latter always tending to ignore\nit unduly. Radical empiricism, on the contrary, is fair to both the\nunity and the disconnection. It finds no reason for treating either as\nillusory. It allots to each its definite sphere of description, and\nagrees that there appear to be actual forces at work which tend, as time\ngoes on, to make the unity greater.\nThe conjunctive relation that has given most trouble to philosophy is\nthe _co-conscious transition_, so to call it, by which one experience\npasses into another when both belong to the same self. About the facts\nthere is no question. My experiences and your experiences are 'with'\neach other in various external ways, but mine pass into mine, and yours\npass into yours in a way in which yours and mine never pass into one\nanother. Within each of our personal histories, subject, object,\ninterest and purpose _are continuous or may be continuous_.[28] Personal\nhistories are processes of change in time, and _the change itself is one\nof the things immediately experienced_. 'Change' in this case means\ncontinuous as opposed to discontinuous transition. But continuous\ntransition is one sort of a conjunctive relation; and to be a radical\nempiricist means to hold fast to this conjunctive relation of all\nothers, for this is the strategic point, the position through which, if\na hole be made, all the corruptions of dialectics and all the\nmetaphysical fictions pour into our philosophy. The holding fast to this\nrelation means taking it at its face value, neither less nor more; and\nto take it at its face value means first of all to take it just as we\nfeel it, and not to confuse ourselves with abstract talk _about_ it,\ninvolving words that drive us to invent secondary conceptions in order\nto neutralize their suggestions and to make our actual experience again\nseem rationally possible.\nWhat I do feel simply when a later moment of my experience succeeds an\nearlier one is that though they are two moments, the transition from the\none to the other is _continuous_. Continuity here is a definite sort of\nexperience; just as definite as is the _discontinuity-experience_ which\nI find it impossible to avoid when I seek to make the transition from an\nexperience of my own to one of yours. In this latter case I have to get\non and off again, to pass from a thing lived to another thing only\nconceived, and the break is positively experienced and noted. Though the\nfunctions exerted by my experience and by yours may be the same (_e.g._,\nthe same objects known and the same purposes followed), yet the sameness\nhas in this case to be ascertained expressly (and often with difficulty\nand uncertainty) after the break has been felt; whereas in passing from\none of my own moments to another the sameness of object and interest is\nunbroken, and both the earlier and the later experience are of things\ndirectly lived.\nThere is no other _nature_, no other whatness than this absence of break\nand this sense of continuity in that most intimate of all conjunctive\nrelations, the passing of one experience into another when they belong\nto the same self. And this whatness is real empirical 'content,' just as\nthe whatness of separation and discontinuity is real content in the\ncontrasted case. Practically to experience one's personal continuum in\nthis living way is to know the originals of the ideas of continuity and\nof sameness, to know what the words stand for concretely, to own all\nthat they can ever mean. But all experiences have their conditions; and\nover-subtle intellects, thinking about the facts here, and asking how\nthey are possible, have ended by substituting a lot of static objects of\nconception for the direct perceptual experiences. \"Sameness,\" they have\nsaid, \"must be a stark numerical identity; it can't run on from next to\nnext. Continuity can't mean mere absence of gap; for if you say two\nthings are in immediate contact, _at_ the contact how can they be two?\nIf, on the other hand, you put a relation of transition between them,\nthat itself is a third thing, and needs to be related or hitched to its\nterms. An infinite series is involved,\" and so on. The result is that\nfrom difficulty to difficulty, the plain conjunctive experience has been\ndiscredited by both schools, the empiricists leaving things permanently\ndisjoined, and the rationalist remedying the looseness by their\nAbsolutes or Substances, or whatever other fictitious agencies of union\nthey may have employed.[29] From all which artificiality we can be saved\nby a couple of simple reflections: first, that conjunctions and\nseparations are, at all events, co-ordinate phenomena which, if we take\nexperiences at their face value, must be accounted equally real; and\nsecond, that if we insist on treating things as really separate when\nthey are given as continuously joined, invoking, when union is required,\ntranscendental principles to overcome the separateness we have assumed,\nthen we ought to stand ready to perform the converse act. We ought to\ninvoke higher principles of _dis_union, also, to make our merely\nexperienced disjunctions more truly real. Failing thus, we ought to let\nthe originally given continuities stand on their own bottom. We have no\nright to be lopsided or to blow capriciously hot and cold.\nIII. THE COGNITIVE RELATION\nThe first great pitfall from which such a radical standing by experience\nwill save us is an artificial conception of the _relations between\nknower and known_. Throughout the history of philosophy the subject and\nits object have been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities; and\nthereupon the presence of the latter to the former, or the\n'apprehension' by the former of the latter, has assumed a paradoxical\ncharacter which all sorts of theories had to be invented to overcome.\nRepresentative theories put a mental 'representation,' 'image,' or\n'content' into the gap, as a sort of intermediary. Common-sense theories\nleft the gap untouched, declaring our mind able to clear it by a\nself-transcending leap. Transcendentalist theories left it impossible to\ntraverse by finite knowers, and brought an Absolute in to perform the\nsaltatory act. All the while, in the very bosom of the finite\nexperience, every conjunction required to make the relation intelligible\nis given in full. Either the knower and the known are:\n(1) the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different\ncontexts; or they are\n(2) two pieces of _actual_ experience belonging to the same subject,\nwith definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience between\nthem; or\n(3) the known is a _possible_ experience either of that subject or\nanother, to which the said conjunctive transitions _would_ lead, if\nsufficiently prolonged.\nTo discuss all the ways in which one experience may function as the\nknower of another, would be incompatible with the limits of this\nessay.[30] I have just treated of type 1, the kind of knowledge called\nperception.[31] This is the type of case in which the mind enjoys direct\n'acquaintance' with a present object. In the other types the mind has\n'knowledge-about' an object not immediately there. Of type 2, the\nsimplest sort of conceptual knowledge, I have given some account in two\n[earlier] articles.[32] Type 3 can always formally and hypothetically be\nreduced to type 2, so that a brief description of that type will put the\npresent reader sufficiently at my point of view, and make him see what\nthe actual meanings of the mysterious cognitive relation may be.\nSuppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge, at ten\nminutes' walk from 'Memorial Hall,' and to be thinking truly of the\nlatter object. My mind may have before it only the name, or it may have\na clear image, or it may have a very dim image of the hall, but such\nintrinsic differences in the image make no difference in its cognitive\nfunction. Certain _extrinsic_ phenomena, special experiences of\nconjunction, are what impart to the image, be it what it may, its\nknowing office.\nFor instance, if you ask me what hall I mean by my image, and I can\ntell you nothing; or if I fail to point or lead you towards the Harvard\nDelta; or if, being led by you, I am uncertain whether the Hall I see be\nwhat I had in mind or not; you would rightly deny that I had 'meant'\nthat particular hall at all, even though my mental image might to some\ndegree have resembled it. The resemblance would count in that case as\ncoincidental merely, for all sorts of things of a kind resemble one\nanother in this world without being held for that reason to take\ncognizance of one another.\nOn the other hand, if I can lead you to the hall, and tell you of its\nhistory and present uses; if in its presence I feel my idea, however\nimperfect it may have been, to have led hither and to be now\n_terminated;_ if the associates of the image and of the felt hall run\nparallel, so that each term of the one context corresponds serially, as\nI walk, with an answering term of the others; why then my soul was\nprophetic, and my idea must be, and by common consent would be, called\ncognizant of reality. That percept was what I _meant_, for into it my\nidea has passed by conjunctive experiences of sameness and fulfilled\nintention. Nowhere is there jar, but every later moment continues and\ncorroborates an earlier one.\nIn this continuing and corroborating, taken in no transcendental sense,\nbut denoting definitely felt transitions, _lies all that the knowing of\na percept by an idea can possibly contain or signify_. Wherever such\ntransitions are felt, the first experience _knows_ the last one. Where\nthey do not, or where even as possibles they can not, intervene, there\ncan be no pretence of knowing. In this latter case the extremes will be\nconnected, if connected at all, by inferior relations--bare likeness or\nsuccession, or by 'withness' alone. Knowledge of sensible realities thus\ncomes to life inside the tissue of experience. It is _made_; and made by\nrelations that unroll themselves in time. Whenever certain\nintermediaries are given, such that, as they develop towards their\nterminus, there is experience from point to point of one direction\nfollowed, and finally of one process fulfilled, the result is that\n_their starting-point thereby becomes a knower and their terminus an\nobject meant or known_. That is all that knowing (in the simple case\nconsidered) can be known-as, that is the whole of its nature, put into\nexperiential terms. Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences we\nmay freely say that we had the terminal object 'in mind' from the\noutset, even although _at_ the outset nothing was there in us but a flat\npiece of substantive experience like any other, with no\nself-transcendency about it, and no mystery save the mystery of coming\ninto existence and of being gradually followed by other pieces of\nsubstantive experience, with conjunctively transitional experiences\nbetween. That is what we _mean_ here by the object's being 'in mind.' Of\nany deeper more real way of being in mind we have no positive\nconception, and we have no right to discredit our actual experience by\ntalking of such a way at all.\nI know that many a reader will rebel at this. \"Mere intermediaries,\" he\nwill say, \"even though they be feelings of continuously growing\nfulfilment, only _separate_ the knower from the known, whereas what we\nhave in knowledge is a kind of immediate touch of the one by the other,\nan 'apprehension' in the etymological sense of the word, a leaping of\nthe chasm as by lightning, an act by which two terms are smitten into\none, over the head of their distinctness. All these dead intermediaries\nof yours are out of each other, and outside of their termini still.\"\nBut do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping his\nbone and snapping at its image in the water? If we knew any more real\nkind of union _aliunde_, we might be entitled to brand all our\nempirical unions as a sham. But unions by continuous transition are the\nonly ones we know of, whether in this matter of a knowledge-about that\nterminates in an acquaintance, whether in personal identity, in logical\npredication through the copula 'is,' or elsewhere. If anywhere there\nwere more absolute unions realized, they could only reveal themselves to\nus by just such conjunctive results. These are what the unions are\n_worth_, these are all that _we can ever practically mean_ by union, by\ncontinuity. Is it not time to repeat what Lotze said of substances, that\nto _act like_ one is to _be_ one?[33] Should we not say here that to be\nexperienced as continuous is to be really continuous, in a world where\nexperience and reality come to the same thing? In a picture gallery a\npainted hook will serve to hang a painted chain by, a painted cable will\nhold a painted ship. In a world where both the terms and their\ndistinctions are affairs of experience, conjunctions that are\nexperienced must be at least as real as anything else. They will be'\nabsolutely' real conjunctions, if we have no transphenomenal Absolute\nready, to derealize the whole experienced world by, at a stroke. If, on\nthe other hand, we had such an Absolute, not one of our opponents'\ntheories of knowledge could remain standing any better than ours could;\nfor the distinctions as well as the conjunctions of experience would\nimpartially fall its prey. The whole question of how 'one' thing can\nknow 'another' would cease to be a real one at all in a world where\notherness itself was an illusion.[34]\nSo much for the essentials of the cognitive relation, where the\nknowledge is conceptual in type, or forms knowledge 'about' an object.\nIt consists in intermediary experiences (possible, if not actual) of\ncontinuously developing progress, and, finally, of fulfilment, when the\nsensible percept, which is the object, is reached. The percept here not\nonly _verifies_ the concept, proves its function of knowing that percept\nto be true, but the percept's existence as the terminus of the chain of\nintermediaries _creates_ the function. Whatever terminates that chain\nwas, because it now proves itself to be, what the concept 'had in mind.'\nThe towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies in\nthe fact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\n_representative_, not in any quasi-miraculous 'epistemological' sense,\nbut in the definite practical sense of being its _substitute_ in various\noperations, sometimes physical and sometimes mental, which lead us to\nits associates and results. By experimenting on our ideas of reality, we\nmay save ourselves the trouble of experimenting on the real experiences\nwhich they severally mean. The ideas form related systems, corresponding\npoint for point to the systems which the realities form; and by letting\nan ideal term call up its associates systematically, we may be led to a\nterminus which the corresponding real term would have led to in case we\nhad operated on the real world. And this brings us to the general\nquestion of substitution.\nIV. SUBSTITUTION\nIn Taine's brilliant book on 'Intelligence,' substitution was for the\nfirst time named as a cardinal logical function, though of course the\nfacts had always been familiar enough. What, exactly, in a system of\nexperiences, does the 'substitution' of one of them for another mean?\nAccording to my view, experience as a whole is a process in time,\nwhereby innumerable particular terms lapse and are superseded by others\nthat follow upon them by transitions which, whether disjunctive or\nconjunctive in content, are themselves experiences, and must in general\nbe accounted at least as real as the terms which they relate. What the\nnature of the event called 'superseding' signifies, depends altogether\non the kind of transition that obtains. Some experiences simply abolish\ntheir predecessors without continuing them in any way. Others are felt\nto increase or to enlarge their meaning, to carry out their purpose, or\nto bring us nearer to their goal. They 'represent' them, and may fulfil\ntheir function better than they fulfilled it themselves. But to 'fulfil\na function' in a world of pure experience can be conceived and defined\nin only one possible way. In such a world transitions and arrivals (or\nterminations) are the only events that happen, though they happen by so\nmany sorts of path. The only function that one experience can perform is\nto lead into another experience; and the only fulfilment we can speak of\nis the reaching of a certain experienced end. When one experience leads\nto (or can lead to) the same end as another, they agree in function. But\nthe whole system of experiences as they are immediately given presents\nitself as a quasi-chaos through which one can pass out of an initial\nterm in many directions and yet end in the same terminus, moving from\nnext to next by a great many possible paths.\nEither one of these paths might be a functional substitute for another,\nand to follow one rather than another might on occasion be an\nadvantageous thing to do. As a matter of fact, and in a general way,\nthe paths that run through conceptual experiences, that is, through\n'thoughts' or 'ideas' that 'know' the things in which they terminate,\nare highly advantageous paths to follow. Not only do they yield\ninconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the 'universal'\ncharacter[35] which they frequently possess, and to their capacity for\nassociation with one another in great systems, they outstrip the tardy\nconsecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us on towards our\nultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than the following of\ntrains of sensible perception ever could. Wonderful are the new cuts and\nthe short-circuits which the thought-paths make. Most thought-paths, it\nis true, are substitutes for nothing actual; they end outside the real\nworld altogether, in wayward fancies, utopias, fictions or mistakes. But\nwhere they do re-enter reality and terminate therein, we substitute them\nalways; and with these substitutes we pass the greater number of our\nhours.\nThis is why I called our experiences, taken all together, a quasi-chaos.\nThere is vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiences than\nwe commonly suppose. The objective nucleus of every man's experience,\nhis own body, is, it is true, a continuous percept; and equally\ncontinuous as a percept (though we may be inattentive to it) is the\nmaterial environment of that body, changing by gradual transition when\nthe body moves. But the distant parts of the physical world are at all\ntimes absent from us, and form conceptual objects merely, into the\nperceptual reality of which our life inserts itself at points discrete\nand relatively rare. Round their several objective nuclei, partly shared\nand common and partly discrete, of the real physical world, innumerable\nthinkers, pursuing their several lines of physically true cogitation,\ntrace paths that intersect one another only at discontinuous perceptual\npoints, and the rest of the time are quite incongruent; and around all\nthe nuclei of shared 'reality,' as around the Dyak's head of my late\nmetaphor, floats the vast cloud of experiences that are wholly\nsubjective, that are non-substitutional, that find not even an eventual\nending for themselves in the perceptual world--the mere day-dreams and\njoys and sufferings and wishes of the individual minds. These exist\n_with_ one another, indeed, and with the objective nuclei, but out of\nthem it is probable that to all eternity no interrelated system of any\nkind will ever be made.\nThis notion of the purely substitutional or conceptual physical world\nbrings us to the most critical of all the steps in the development of a\nphilosophy of pure experience. The paradox of self-transcendency in\nknowledge comes back upon us here, but I think that our notions of pure\nexperience and of substitution, and our radically empirical view of\nconjunctive transitions, are _Denkmittel_ that will carry us safely\nthrough the pass.\nV. WHAT OBJECTIVE REFERENCE IS.\nWhosoever feels his experience to be something substitutional even while\nhe has it, may be said to have an experience that reaches beyond itself.\nFrom inside of its own entity it says 'more,' and postulates reality\nexisting elsewhere. For the transcendentalist, who holds knowing to\nconsist in a _salto mortale_ across an 'epistemological chasm,' such an\nidea presents no difficulty; but it seems at first sight as if it might\nbe inconsistent with an empiricism like our own. Have we not explained\nthat conceptual knowledge is made such wholly by the existence of things\nthat fall outside of the knowing experience itself--by intermediary\nexperiences and by a terminus that fulfils? Can the knowledge be there\nbefore these elements that constitute its being have come? And, if\nknowledge be not there, how can objective reference occur?\nThe key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing as\nverified and completed, and the same knowing as in transit and on its\nway. To recur to the Memorial Hall example lately used, it is only when\nour idea of the Hall has actually terminated in the percept that we know\n'for certain' that from the beginning it was truly cognitive of _that_.\nUntil established by the end of the process, its quality of knowing\nthat, or indeed of knowing anything, could still be doubted; and yet the\nknowing really was there, as the result now shows. We were _virtual_\nknowers of the Hall long before we were certified to have been its\nactual knowers, by the percept's retroactive validating power. Just so\nwe are 'mortal' all the time, by reason of the virtuality of the\ninevitable event which will make us so when it shall have come.\nNow the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond this\nvirtual stage. It never is completed or nailed down. I speak not merely\nof our ideas of imperceptibles like ether-waves or dissociated 'ions,'\nor of 'ejects' like the contents of our neighbors' minds; I speak also\nof ideas which we might verify if we would take the trouble, but which\nwe hold for true although unterminated perceptually, because nothing\nsays 'no' to us, and there is no contradicting truth in sight. _To\ncontinue thinking unchallenged is, ninety-nine times out of a hundred,\nour practical substitute for knowing in the completed sense._ As each\nexperience runs by cognitive transition into the next one, and we\nnowhere feel a collision with what we elsewhere count as truth or fact,\nwe commit ourselves to the current as if the port were sure. We live, as\nit were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-crest, and our sense\nof a determinate direction in falling forward is all we cover of the\nfuture of our path. It is as if a differential quotient should be\nconscious and treat itself as an adequate substitute for a traced-out\ncurve. Our experience, _inter alia_, is of variations of rate and of\ndirection, and lives in these transitions more than in the journey's\nend. The experiences of tendency are sufficient to act upon--what more\ncould we have _done_ at those moments even if the later verification\ncomes complete?\nThis is what, as a radical empiricist, I say to the charge that the\nobjective reference which is so flagrant a character of our experiences\ninvolves a chasm and a mortal leap. A positively conjunctive transition\ninvolves neither chasm nor leap. Being the very original of what we mean\nby continuity, it makes a continuum wherever it appears. I know full\nwell that such brief words as these will leave the hardened\ntranscendentalist unshaken. Conjunctive experiences _separate_ their\nterms, he will still say: they are third things interposed, that have\nthemselves to be conjoined by new links, and to invoke them makes our\ntrouble infinitely worse. To 'feel' our motion forward is impossible.\nMotion implies terminus; and how can terminus be felt before we have\narrived? The barest start and sally forwards, the barest tendency to\nleave the instant, involves the chasm and the leap. Conjunctive\ntransitions are the most superficial of appearances, illusions of our\nsensibility which philosophical reflection pulverizes at a touch.\nConception is our only trustworthy instrument, conception and the\nAbsolute working hand in hand. Conception disintegrates experience\nutterly, but its disjunctions are easily overcome again when the\nAbsolute takes up the task.\nSuch transcendentalists I must leave, provisionally at least, in full\npossession of their creed.[36] I have no space for polemics in this\narticle, so I shall simply formulate the empiricist doctrine as my\nhypothesis, leaving it to work or not work as it may.\nObjective reference, I say then, is an incident of the fact that so much\nof our experience comes as an insufficient and consists of process and\ntransition. Our fields of experience have no more definite boundaries\nthan have our fields of view. Both are fringed forever by a _more_ that\ncontinuously develops, and that continuously supersedes them as life\nproceeds. The relations, generally speaking, are as real here as the\nterms are, and the only complaint of the transcendentalist's with which\nI could at all sympathize would be his charge that, by first making\nknowledge to consist in external relations as I have done, and by then\nconfessing that nine-tenths of the time these are not actually but only\nvirtually there, I have knocked the solid bottom out of the whole\nbusiness, and palmed off a substitute of knowledge for the genuine\nthing. Only the admission, such a critic might say, that our ideas are\nself-transcendent and 'true' already, in advance of the experiences that\nare to terminate them, can bring solidity back to knowledge in a world\nlike this, in which transitions and terminations are only by exception\nfulfilled.\nThis seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic method.\nWhen a dispute arises, that method consists in auguring what practical\nconsequences would be different if one side rather than the other were\ntrue. If no difference can be thought of, the dispute is a quarrel over\nwords. What then would the self-transcendency affirmed to exist in\nadvance of all experiential mediation or termination, be _known-as_?\nWhat would it practically result in for _us_, were it true?\nIt could only result in our orientation, in the turning of our\nexpectations and practical tendencies into the right path; and the\nright path here, so long as we and the object are not yet face to face\n(or can never get face to face, as in the case of ejects), would be the\npath that led us into the object's nearest neighborhood. Where direct\nacquaintance is lacking, 'knowledge about' is the next best thing, and\nan acquaintance with what actually lies about the object, and is most\nclosely related to it, puts such knowledge within our grasp. Ether-waves\nand your anger, for example, are things in which my thoughts will never\n_perceptually_ terminate, but my concepts of them lead me to their very\nbrink, to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful words and deeds which\nare their really next effects.\nEven if our ideas did in themselves carry the postulated\nself-transcendency, it would still remain true that their putting us\ninto possession of such effects _would be the sole cash-value of the\nself-transcendency for us_. And this cash-value, it is needless to say,\nis _verbatim et literatim_ what our empiricist account pays in. On\npragmatist principles therefore, a dispute over self-transcendency is a\npure logomachy. Call our concepts of ejective things self-transcendent\nor the reverse, it makes no difference, so long as we don't differ about\nthe nature of that exalted virtue's fruits--fruits for us, of course,\nhumanistic fruits. If an Absolute were proved to exist for other\nreasons, it might well appear that _his_ knowledge is terminated in\ninnumerable cases where ours is still incomplete. That, however, would\nbe a fact indifferent to our knowledge. The latter would grow neither\nworse nor better, whether we acknowledged such an Absolute or left him\nout.\nSo the notion of a knowledge still _in transitu_ and on its way joins\nhands here with that notion of a 'pure experience' which I tried to\nexplain in my [essay] entitled 'Does Consciousness Exist?' The instant\nfield of the present is always experience in its 'pure' state, plain\nunqualified actuality, a simple _that_, as yet undifferentiated into\nthing and thought, and only virtually classifiable as objective fact or\nas some one's opinion about fact. This is as true when the field is\nconceptual as when it is perceptual. 'Memorial Hall' is 'there' in my\nidea as much as when I stand before it. I proceed to act on its account\nin either case. Only in the later experience that supersedes the present\none is this _na\u00eff_ immediacy retrospectively split into two parts, a\n'consciousness' and its 'content,' and the content corrected or\nconfirmed. While still pure, or present, any experience--mine, for\nexample, of what I write about in these very lines--passes for 'truth.'\nThe morrow may reduce it to 'opinion.' The transcendentalist in all his\nparticular knowledges is as liable to this reduction as I am: his\nAbsolute does not save him. Why, then, need he quarrel with an account\nof knowing that merely leaves it liable to this inevitable condition?\nWhy insist that knowing is a static relation out of time when it\npractically seems so much a function of our active life? For a thing to\nbe valid, says Lotze, is the same as to make itself valid. When the\nwhole universe seems only to be making itself valid and to be still\nincomplete (else why its ceaseless changing?) why, of all things,\nshould knowing be exempt? Why should it not be making itself valid like\neverything else? That some parts of it may be already valid or verified\nbeyond dispute, the empirical philosopher, of course, like any one else,\nmay always hope.\nVI. THE CONTERMINOUSNESS OF DIFFERENT MINDS[37]\nWith transition and prospect thus enthroned in pure experience, it is\nimpossible to subscribe to the idealism of the English school. Radical\nempiricism has, in fact, more affinities with natural realism than with\nthe views of Berkeley or of Mill, and this can be easily shown.\nFor the Berkeleyan school, ideas (the verbal equivalent of what I term\nexperiences) are discontinuous. The content of each is wholly immanent,\nand there are no transitions with which they are consubstantial and\nthrough which their beings may unite. Your Memorial Hall and mine, even\nwhen both are percepts, are wholly out of connection with each other.\nOur lives are a congeries of solipsisms, out of which in strict logic\nonly a God could compose a universe even of discourse. No dynamic\ncurrents run between my objects and your objects. Never can our minds\nmeet in the _same_.\nThe incredibility of such a philosophy is flagrant. It is 'cold,\nstrained, and unnatural' in a supreme degree; and it may be doubted\nwhether even Berkeley himself, who took it so religiously, really\nbelieved, when walking through the streets of London, that his spirit\nand the spirits of his fellow wayfarers had absolutely different towns\nin view.\nTo me the decisive reason in favor of our minds meeting in _some_ common\nobjects at least is that, unless I make that supposition, I have no\nmotive for assuming that your mind exists at all. Why do I postulate\nyour mind? Because I see your body acting in a certain way. Its\ngestures, facial movements, words and conduct generally, are\n'expressive,' so I deem it actuated as my own is, by an inner life like\nmine. This argument from analogy is my _reason_, whether an instinctive\nbelief runs before it or not. But what is 'your body' here but a percept\nin _my_ field? It is only as animating _that_ object, _my_ object, that\nI have any occasion to think of you at all. If the body that you actuate\nbe not the very body that I see there, but some duplicate body of your\nown with which that has nothing to do, we belong to different universes,\nyou and I, and for me to speak of you is folly. Myriads of such\nuniverses even now may coexist, irrelevant to one another; my concern is\nsolely with the universe with which my own life is connected.\nIn that perceptual part of _my_ universe which I call _your_ body, your\nmind and my mind meet and may be called conterminous. Your mind actuates\nthat body and mine sees it; my thoughts pass into it as into their\nharmonious cognitive fulfilment; your emotions and volitions pass into\nit as causes into their effects.\nBut that percept hangs together with all our other physical percepts.\nThey are of one stuff with it; and if it be our common possession, they\nmust be so likewise. For instance, your hand lays hold of one end of a\nrope and my hand lays hold of the other end. We pull against each other.\nCan our two hands be mutual objects in this experience, and the rope not\nbe mutual also? What is true of the rope is true of any other percept.\nYour objects are over and over again the same as mine. If I ask you\n_where_ some object of yours is, our old Memorial Hall, for example, you\npoint to _my_ Memorial Hall with _your_ hand which _I_ see. If you alter\nan object in your world, put out a candle, for example, when I am\npresent, _my_ candle _ipso facto_ goes out. It is only as altering my\nobjects that I guess you to exist. If your objects do not coalesce with\nmy objects, if they be not identically where mine are, they must be\nproved to be positively somewhere else. But no other location can be\nassigned for them, so their place must be what it seems to be, the\nsame.[38]\nPractically, then, our minds meet in a world of objects which they share\nin common, which would still be there, if one or several of the minds\nwere destroyed. I can see no formal objection to this supposition's\nbeing literally true. On the principles which I am defending, a 'mind'\nor 'personal consciousness' is the name for a series of experiences run\ntogether by certain definite transitions, and an objective reality is a\nseries of similar experiences knit by different transitions. If one and\nthe same experience can figure twice, once in a mental and once in a\nphysical context (as I have tried, in my article on 'Consciousness,' to\nshow that it can), one does not see why it might not figure thrice, or\nfour times, or any number of times, by running into as many different\nmental contexts, just as the same point, lying at their intersection,\ncan be continued into many different lines. Abolishing any number of\ncontexts would not destroy the experience itself or its other contexts,\nany more than abolishing some of the point's linear continuations would\ndestroy the others, or destroy the point itself.\nI well know the subtle dialectic which insists that a term taken in\nanother relation must needs be an intrinsically different term. The crux\nis always the old Greek one, that the same man can't be tall in relation\nto one neighbor, and short in relation to another, for that would make\nhim tall and short at once. In this essay I can not stop to refute this\ndialectic, so I pass on, leaving my flank for the time exposed.[39] But\nif my reader will only allow that the same '_now_' both ends his past\nand begins his future; or that, when he buys an acre of land from his\nneighbor, it is the same acre that successively figures in the two\nestates; or that when I pay him a dollar, the same dollar goes into his\npocket that came out of mine; he will also in consistency have to allow\nthat the same object may conceivably play a part in, as being related to\nthe rest of, any number of otherwise entirely different minds. This is\nenough for my present point: the common-sense notion of minds sharing\nthe same object offers no special logical or epistemological\ndifficulties of its own; it stands or falls with the general possibility\nof things being in conjunctive relation with other things at all.\nIn principle, then, let natural realism pass for possible. Your mind and\nmine _may_ terminate in the same percept, not merely against it, as if\nit were a third external thing, but by inserting themselves into it and\ncoalescing with it, for such is the sort of conjunctive union that\nappears to be experienced when a perceptual terminus 'fulfils.' Even so,\ntwo hawsers may embrace the same pile, and yet neither one of them touch\nany other part except that pile, of what the other hawser is attached\nto.\nIt is therefore not a formal question, but a question of empirical fact\nsolely, whether, when you and I are said to know the 'same' Memorial\nHall, our minds do terminate at or in a numerically identical percept.\nObviously, as a plain matter of fact, they do _not_. Apart from\ncolor-blindness and such possibilities, we see the Hall in different\nperspectives. You may be on one side of it and I on another. The percept\nof each of us, as he sees the surface of the Hall, is moreover only his\nprovisional terminus. The next thing beyond my percept is not your\nmind, but more percepts of my own into which my first percept develops,\nthe interior of the Hall, for instance, or the inner structure of its\nbricks and mortar. If our minds were in a literal sense _con_terminous,\nneither could get beyond the percept which they had in common, it would\nbe an ultimate barrier between them--unless indeed they flowed over it\nand became 'co-conscious' over a still larger part of their content,\nwhich (thought-transference apart) is not supposed to be the case. In\npoint of fact the ultimate common barrier can always be pushed, by both\nminds, farther than any actual percept of either, until at last it\nresolves itself into the mere notion of imperceptibles like atoms or\nether, so that, where we do terminate in percepts, our knowledge is only\nspeciously completed, being, in theoretic strictness, only a virtual\nknowledge of those remoter objects which conception carries out.\nIs natural realism, permissible in logic, refuted then by empirical\nfact? Do our minds have no object in common after all?\nYes, they certainly have _Space_ in common. On pragmatic principles we\nare obliged to predicate sameness wherever we can predicate no\nassignable point of difference. If two named things have every quality\nand function indiscernible, and are at the same time in the same place,\nthey must be written down as numerically one thing under two different\nnames. But there is no test discoverable, so far as I know, by which it\ncan be shown that the place occupied by your percept of Memorial Hall\ndiffers from the place occupied by mine. The percepts themselves may be\nshown to differ; but if each of us be asked to point out where his\npercept is, we point to an identical spot. All the relations, whether\ngeometrical or causal, of the Hall originate or terminate in that spot\nwherein our hands meet, and where each of us begins to work if he wishes\nto make the Hall change before the other's eyes. Just so it is with our\nbodies. That body of yours which you actuate and feel from within must\nbe in the same spot as the body of yours which I see or touch from\nwithout. 'There' for me means where I place my finger. If you do not\nfeel my finger's contact to be 'there' in _my_ sense, when I place it on\nyour body, where then do you feel it? Your inner actuations of your body\nmeet my finger _there_: it is _there_ that you resist its push, or\nshrink back, or sweep the finger aside with your hand. Whatever farther\nknowledge either of us may acquire of the real constitution of the body\nwhich we thus feel, you from within and I from without, it is in that\nsame place that the newly conceived or perceived constituents have to be\nlocated, and it is _through_ that space that your and my mental\nintercourse with each other has always to be carried on, by the\nmediation of impressions which I convey thither, and of the reactions\nthence which those impressions may provoke from you.\nIn general terms, then, whatever differing contents our minds may\neventually fill a place with, the place itself is a numerically\nidentical content of the two minds, a piece of common property in which,\nthrough which, and over which they join. The receptacle of certain of\nour experiences being thus common, the experiences themselves might some\nday become common also. If that day ever did come, our thoughts would\nterminate in a complete empirical identity, there would be an end, so\nfar as _those_ experiences went, to our discussions about truth. No\npoints of difference appearing, they would have to count as the same.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nWith this we have the outlines of a philosophy of pure experience before\nus. At the outset of my essay, I called it a mosaic philosophy. In\nactual mosaics the pieces are held together by their bedding, for which\nbedding the Substances, transcendental Egos, or Absolutes of other\nphilosophies may be taken to stand. In radical empiricism there is no\nbedding; it is as if the pieces clung together by their edges, the\ntransitions experienced between them forming their cement. Of course\nsuch a metaphor is misleading, for in actual experience the more\nsubstantive and the more transitive parts run into each other\ncontinuously, there is in general no separateness needing to be\novercome by an external cement; and whatever separateness is actually\nexperienced is not overcome, it stays and counts as separateness to the\nend. But the metaphor serves to symbolize the fact that Experience\nitself, taken at large, can grow by its edges. That one moment of it\nproliferates into the next by transitions which, whether conjunctive or\ndisjunctive, continue the experiential tissue, can not, I contend, be\ndenied. Life is in the transitions as much as in the terms connected;\noften, indeed, it seems to be there more emphatically, as if our spurts\nand sallies forward were the real firing-line of the battle, were like\nthe thin line of flame advancing across the dry autumnal field which the\nfarmer proceeds to burn. In this line we live prospectively as well as\nretrospectively. It is 'of' the past, inasmuch as it comes expressly as\nthe past's continuation; it is 'of' the future in so far as the future,\nwhen it comes, will have continued _it_.\nThese relations of continuous transition experienced are what make our\nexperiences cognitive. In the simplest and completest cases the\nexperiences are cognitive of one another. When one of them terminates a\nprevious series of them with a sense of fulfilment, it, we say, is what\nthose other experiences 'had in view.' The knowledge, in such a case, is\nverified; the truth is 'salted down.' Mainly, however, we live on\nspeculative investments, or on our prospects only. But living on things\n_in posse_ is as good as living in the actual, so long as our credit\nremains good. It is evident that for the most part it is good, and that\nthe universe seldom protests our drafts.\nIn this sense we at every moment can continue to believe in an existing\n_beyond_. It is only in special cases that our confident rush forward\ngets rebuked. The beyond must, of course, always in our philosophy be\nitself of an experiential nature. If not a future experience of our own\nor a present one of our neighbor, it must be a thing in itself in Dr.\nPrince's and Professor Strong's sense of the term--that is, it must be\nan experience _for_ itself whose relation to other things we translate\ninto the action of molecules, ether-waves, or whatever else the\nphysical symbols may be.[40] This opens the chapter of the relations of\nradical empiricism to panpsychism, into which I can not enter now.[41]\nThe beyond can in any case exist simultaneously--for it can be\nexperienced _to have existed_ simultaneously--with the experience that\npractically postulates it by looking in its direction, or by turning or\nchanging in the direction of which it is the goal. Pending that\nactuality of union, in the virtuality of which the 'truth,' even now, of\nthe postulation consists, the beyond and its knower are entities split\noff from each other. The world is in so far forth a pluralism of which\nthe unity is not fully experienced as yet. But, as fast as verifications\ncome, trains of experience, once separate, run into one another; and\nthat is why I said, earlier in my article, that the unity of the world\nis on the whole undergoing increase. The universe continually grows in\nquantity by new experiences that graft themselves upon the older mass;\nbut these very new experiences often help the mass to a more\nconsolidated form.\nThese are the main features of a philosophy of pure experience. It has\ninnumerable other aspects and arouses innumerable questions, but the\npoints I have touched on seem enough to make an entering wedge. In my\nown mind such a philosophy harmonizes best with a radical pluralism,\nwith novelty and indeterminism, moralism and theism, and with the\n'humanism' lately sprung upon us by the Oxford and the Chicago\nschools.[42] I can not, however, be sure that all these doctrines are\nits necessary and indispensable allies. It presents so many points of\ndifference, both from the common sense and from the idealism that have\nmade our philosophic language, that it is almost as difficult to state\nit as it is to think it out clearly, and if it is ever to grow into a\nrespectable system, it will have to be built up by the contributions of\nmany co-operating minds. It seems to me, as I said at the outset of this\nessay, that many minds are, in point of fact, now turning in a direction\nthat points towards radical empiricism. If they are carried farther by\nmy words, and if then they add their stronger voices to my feebler one,\nthe publication of this essay will have been worth while.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[25] [Reprinted from the _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Cf. also \"Humanism and Truth Once\nMore,\" below, pp. 244-265.]\nIII\nTHE THING AND ITS RELATIONS[43]\nExperience in its immediacy seems perfectly fluent. The active sense of\nliving which we all enjoy, before reflection shatters our instinctive\nworld for us, is self-luminous and suggests no paradoxes. Its\ndifficulties are disappointments and uncertainties. They are not\nintellectual contradictions.\nWhen the reflective intellect gets at work, however, it discovers\nincomprehensibilities in the flowing process. Distinguishing its\nelements and parts, it gives them separate names, and what it thus\ndisjoins it can not easily put together. Pyrrhonism accepts the\nirrationality and revels in its dialectic elaboration. Other\nphilosophies try, some by ignoring, some by resisting, and some by\nturning the dialectic procedure against itself, negating its first\nnegations, to restore the fluent sense of life again, and let redemption\ntake the place of innocence. The perfection with which any philosophy\nmay do this is the measure of its human success and of its importance in\nphilosophic history. In [the last essay], 'A World of Pure Experience,'\nI tried my own hand sketchily at the problem, resisting certain first\nsteps of dialectics by insisting in a general way that the immediately\nexperienced conjunctive relations are as real as anything else. If my\nsketch is not to appear too _na\u00eff_, I must come closer to details, and\nin the present essay I propose to do so.\nI\n'Pure experience' is the name which I gave to the immediate flux of life\nwhich furnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual\ncategories. Only new-born babes, or men in semi-coma from sleep, drugs,\nillnesses, or blows, may be assumed to have an experience pure in the\nliteral sense of a _that_ which is not yet any definite _what_, tho'\nready to be all sorts of whats; full both of oneness and of manyness,\nbut in respects that don't appear; changing throughout, yet so\nconfusedly that its phases interpenetrate and no points, either of\ndistinction or of identity, can be caught. Pure experience in this state\nis but another name for feeling or sensation. But the flux of it no\nsooner comes than it tends to fill itself with emphases, and these\nsalient parts become identified and fixed and abstracted; so that\nexperience now flows as if shot through with adjectives and nouns and\nprepositions and conjunctions. Its purity is only a relative term,\nmeaning the proportional amount of unverbalized sensation which it still\nembodies.\nFar back as we go, the flux, both as a whole and in its parts, is that\nof things conjunct and separated. The great continua of time, space, and\nthe self envelope everything, betwixt them, and flow together without\ninterfering. The things that they envelope come as separate in some ways\nand as continuous in others. Some sensations coalesce with some ideas,\nand others are irreconcilable. Qualities compenetrate one space, or\nexclude each other from it. They cling together persistently in groups\nthat move as units, or else they separate. Their changes are abrupt or\ndiscontinuous; and their kinds resemble or differ; and, as they do so,\nthey fall into either even or irregular series.\nIn all this the continuities and the discontinuities are absolutely\nco-ordinate matters of immediate feeling. The conjunctions are as\nprimordial elements of 'fact' as are the distinctions and disjunctions.\nIn the same act by which I feel that this passing minute is a new pulse\nof my life, I feel that the old life continues into it, and the feeling\nof continuance in no wise jars upon the simultaneous feeling of a\nnovelty. They, too, compenetrate harmoniously. Prepositions, copulas,\nand conjunctions, 'is,' 'isn't,' 'then,' 'before,' 'in,' 'on,' 'beside,'\n'between,' 'next,' 'like,' 'unlike,' 'as,' 'but,' flower out of the\nstream of pure experience, the stream of concretes or the sensational\nstream, as naturally as nouns and adjectives do, and they melt into it\nagain as fluidly when we apply them to a new portion of the stream.\nII\nIf now we ask why we must thus translate experience from a more concrete\nor pure into a more intellectualized form, filling it with ever more\nabounding conceptual distinctions, rationalism and naturalism give\ndifferent replies.\nThe rationalistic answer is that the theoretic life is absolute and its\ninterests imperative; that to understand is simply the duty of man; and\nthat who questions this need not be argued with, for by the fact of\narguing he gives away his case.\nThe naturalist answer is that the environment kills as well as sustains\nus, and that the tendency of raw experience to extinguish the experient\nhimself is lessened just in the degree in which the elements in it that\nhave a practical bearing upon life are analyzed out of the continuum and\nverbally fixed and coupled together, so that we may know what is in the\nwind for us and get ready to react in time. Had pure experience, the\nnaturalist says, been always perfectly healthy, there would never have\narisen the necessity of isolating or verbalizing any of its terms. We\nshould just have experienced inarticulately and unintellectually\nenjoyed. This leaning on 'reaction' in the naturalist account implies\nthat, whenever we intellectualize a relatively pure experience, we ought\nto do so for the sake of redescending to the purer or more concrete\nlevel again; and that if an intellect stays aloft among its abstract\nterms and generalized relations, and does not reinsert itself with its\nconclusions into some particular point of the immediate stream of life,\nit fails to finish out its function and leaves its normal race unrun.\nMost rationalists nowadays will agree that naturalism gives a true\nenough account of the way in which our intellect arose at first, but\nthey will deny these latter implications. The case, they will say,\nresembles that of sexual love. Originating in the animal need of getting\nanother generation born, this passion has developed secondarily such\nimperious spiritual needs that, if you ask why another generation ought\nto be born at all, the answer is: 'Chiefly that love may go on.' Just\nso with our intellect: it originated as a practical means of serving\nlife; but it has developed incidentally the function of understanding\nabsolute truth; and life itself now seems to be given chiefly as a means\nby which that function may be prosecuted. But truth and the\nunderstanding of it lie among the abstracts and universals, so the\nintellect now carries on its higher business wholly in this region,\nwithout any need of redescending into pure experience again.\nIf the contrasted tendencies which I thus designate as naturalistic and\nrationalistic are not recognized by the reader, perhaps an example will\nmake them more concrete. Mr. Bradley, for instance, is an\nultra-rationalist. He admits that our intellect is primarily practical,\nbut says that, for philosophers, the practical need is simply Truth.\nTruth, moreover, must be assumed 'consistent.' Immediate experience has\nto be broken into subjects and qualities, terms and relations, to be\nunderstood as truth at all. Yet when so broken it is less consistent\nthan ever. Taken raw, it is all un-distinguished. Intellectualized, it\nis all distinction without oneness. 'Such an arrangement may _work_, but\nthe theoretic problem is not solved.' The question is '_how_ the\ndiversity can exist in harmony with the oneness.' To go back to pure\nexperience is unavailing. 'Mere feeling gives no answer to our riddle.'\nEven if your intuition is a fact, it is not an _understanding_. 'It is a\nmere experience, and furnishes no consistent view.' The experience\noffered as facts or truths 'I find that my intellect rejects because\nthey contradict themselves. They offer a complex of diversities\nconjoined in a way which it feels is not its way and which it can not\nrepeat as its own.... For to be satisfied, my intellect must understand,\nand it can not understand by taking a congeries in the lump.'[44] So Mr.\nBradley, in the sole interests of 'understanding' (as he conceives that\nfunction), turns his back on finite experience forever. Truth must lie\nin the opposite direction, the direction of the Absolute; and this kind\nof rationalism and naturalism, or (as I will now call it) pragmatism,\nwalk thenceforward upon opposite paths. For the one, those intellectual\nproducts are most true which, turning their face towards the Absolute,\ncome nearest to symbolizing its ways of uniting the many and the one.\nFor the other, those are most true which most successfully dip back into\nthe finite stream of feeling and grow most easily confluent with some\nparticular wave or wavelet. Such confluence not only proves the\nintellectual operation to have been true (as an addition may 'prove'\nthat a subtraction is already rightly performed), but it constitutes,\naccording to pragmatism, all that we mean by calling it true. Only in so\nfar as they lead us, successfully or unsuccessfully, back into sensible\nexperience again, are our abstracts and universals true or false at\nall.[45]\nIII\nIn Section VI of [the last essay], I adopted in a general way the\ncommon-sense belief that one and the same world is cognized by our\ndifferent minds; but I left undiscussed the dialectical arguments which\nmaintain that this is logically absurd. The usual reason given for its\nbeing absurd is that it assumes one object (to wit, the world) to stand\nin two relations at once; to my mind, namely, and again to yours;\nwhereas a term taken in a second relation can not logically be the same\nterm which it was at first.\nI have heard this reason urged so often in discussing with absolutists,\nand it would destroy my radical empiricism so utterly, if it were valid,\nthat I am bound to give it an attentive ear, and seriously to search its\nstrength.\nFor instance, let the matter in dispute be term _M_, asserted to be on\nthe one hand related to _L_, and on the other to _N_; and let the two\ncases of relation be symbolized by _L--M_ and _M--N_ respectively. When,\nnow, I assume that the experience may immediately come and be given in\nthe shape _L--M--N_, with no trace of doubling or internal fission in\nthe _M_, I am told that this is all a popular delusion; that _L--M--N_\nlogically means two different experiences, _L--M_ and _M--N_, namely;\nand that although the Absolute may, and indeed must, from its superior\npoint of view, read its own kind of unity into _M_'s two editions, yet\nas elements in finite experience the two _M_'s lie irretrievably\nasunder, and the world between them is broken and unbridged.\nIn arguing this dialectic thesis, one must avoid slipping from the\nlogical into the physical point of view. It would be easy, in taking a\nconcrete example to fix one's ideas by, to choose one in which the\nletter _M_ should stand for a collective noun of some sort, which noun,\nbeing related to _L_ by one of its parts and to _N_ by another, would\ninwardly be two things when it stood outwardly in both relations. Thus,\none might say: 'David Hume, who weighed so many stone by his body,\ninfluences posterity by his doctrine.' The body and the doctrine are two\nthings, between which our finite minds can discover no real sameness,\nthough the same name covers both of them. And then, one might continue:\n'Only an Absolute is capable of uniting such a non-identity.' We must, I\nsay, avoid this sort of example, for the dialectic insight, if true at\nall, must apply to terms and relations universally. It must be true of\nabstract units as well as of nouns collective; and if we prove it by\nconcrete examples we must take the simplest, so as to avoid irrelevant\nmaterial suggestions.\nTaken thus in all its generality, the absolutist contention seems to use\nas its major premise Hume's notion 'that all our distinct perceptions\nare distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives any real\nconnexion among distinct existences.'[46] Undoubtedly, since we use two\nphrases in talking first about '_M_'s relation to _L_' and then about\n'_M_'s relation to _N_,' we must be having, or must have had, two\ndistinct perceptions;--and the rest would then seem to follow duly. But\nthe starting-point of the reasoning here seems to be the fact of the two\n_phrases_; and this suggests that the argument may be merely verbal. Can\nit be that the whole dialectic consists in attributing to the experience\ntalked-about a constitution similar to that of the language in which we\ndescribe it? Must we assert the objective double-ness of the _M_ merely\nbecause we have to name it twice over when we name its two relations?\nCandidly, I can think of no other reason than this for the dialectic\nconclusion;[47] for, if we think, not of our words, but of any simple\nconcrete matter which they may be held to signify, the experience itself\nbelies the paradox asserted. We use indeed two separate concepts in\nanalyzing our object, but we know them all the while to be but\nsubstitutional, and that the _M_ in _L--M_ and the _M_ in _M--N mean_\n(_i.e._, are capable of leading to and terminating in) one self-same\npiece, _M_, of sensible experience. This persistent identity of certain\nunits (or emphases, or points, or objects, or members--call them what\nyou will) of the experience-continuum, is just one of those conjunctive\nfeatures of it, on which I am obliged to insist so emphatically.[48] For\nsamenesses are parts of experience's indefeasible structure. When I hear\na bell-stroke and, as life flows on, its after image dies away, I still\nhark back to it as 'that same bell-stroke.' When I see a thing _M_, with\n_L_ to the left of it and _N_ to the right of it, I see it _as_ one _M_;\nand if you tell me I have had to 'take' it twice, I reply that if I\n'took' it a thousand times I should still _see_ it as a unit.[49] Its\nunity is aboriginal, just as the multiplicity of my successive takings\nis aboriginal. It comes unbroken as _that M_, as a singular which I\nencounter; they come broken, as _those_ takings, as my plurality of\noperations. The unity and the separateness are strictly co-ordinate. I\ndo not easily fathom why my opponents should find the separateness so\nmuch more easily understandable that they must needs infect the whole of\nfinite experience with it, and relegate the unity (now taken as a bare\npostulate and no longer as a thing positively perceivable) to the region\nof the Absolute's mysteries. I do not easily fathom this, I say, for the\nsaid opponents are above mere verbal quibbling; yet all that I can catch\nin their talk is the substitution of what is true of certain words for\nwhat is true of what they signify. They stay with the words,--not\nreturning to the stream of life whence all the meaning of them came, and\nwhich is always ready to reabsorb them.\nIV\nFor aught this argument proves, then, we may continue to believe that\none thing can be known by many knowers. But the denial of one thing in\nmany relations is but one application of a still profounder dialectic\ndifficulty. Man can't be good, said the sophists, for man is _man_ and\n_good_ is good; and Hegel[50] and Herbart in their day, more recently A.\nSpir,[51] and most recently and elaborately of all, Mr. Bradley, informs\nus that a term can logically only be a punctiform unit, and that not one\nof the conjunctive relations between things, which experience seems to\nyield, is rationally possible.\nOf course, if true, this cuts off radical empiricism without even a\nshilling. Radical empiricism takes conjunctive relations at their face\nvalue, holding them to be as real as the terms united by them.[52] The\nworld it represents as a collection, some parts of which are\nconjunctively and others disjunctively related. Two parts, themselves\ndisjoined, may nevertheless hang together by intermediaries with which\nthey are severally connected, and the whole world eventually may hang\ntogether similarly, inasmuch as _some_ path of conjunctive transition by\nwhich to pass from one of its parts to another may always be\ndiscernible. Such determinately various hanging-together may be called\n_concatenated_ union, to distinguish it from the 'through-and-through'\ntype of union, 'each in all and all in each' (union of _total conflux_,\nas one might call it), which monistic systems hold to obtain when things\nare taken in their absolute reality. In a concatenated world a partial\nconflux often is experienced. Our concepts and our sensations are\nconfluent; successive states of the same ego, and feelings of the same\nbody are confluent. Where the experience is not of conflux, it may be of\nconterminousness (things with but one thing between); or of\ncontiguousness (nothing between); or of likeness; or of nearness; or of\nsimultaneousness; or of in-ness; or of on-ness; or of for-ness; or of\nsimple with-ness; or even of mere and-ness, which last relation would\nmake of however disjointed a world otherwise, at any rate for that\noccasion a universe 'of discourse.' Now Mr. Bradley tells us that none\nof these relations, as we actually experience them, can possibly be\nreal.[53] My next duty, accordingly, must be to rescue radical\nempiricism from Mr. Bradley. Fortunately, as it seems to me, his general\ncontention, that the very notion of relation is unthinkable clearly, has\nbeen successfully met by many critics.[54]\nIt is a burden to the flesh, and an injustice both to readers and to\nthe previous writers, to repeat good arguments already printed. So, in\nnoticing Mr. Bradley, I will confine myself to the interests of radical\nempiricism solely.\nV\nThe first duty of radical empiricism, taking given conjunctions at their\nface-value, is to class some of them as more intimate and some as more\nexternal. When two terms are _similar_, their very natures enter into\nthe relation. Being _what_ they are, no matter where or when, the\nlikeness never can be denied, if asserted. It continues predicable as\nlong as the terms continue. Other relations, the _where_ and the _when_,\nfor example, seem adventitious. The sheet of paper may be 'off' or 'on'\nthe table, for example; and in either case the relation involves only\nthe outside of its terms. Having an outside, both of them, they\ncontribute by it to the relation. It is external: the term's inner\nnature is irrelevant to it. Any book, any table, may fall into the\nrelation, which is created _pro hac vice_, not by their existence, but\nby their casual situation. It is just because so many of the\nconjunctions of experience seem so external that a philosophy of pure\nexperience must tend to pluralism in its ontology. So far as things have\nspace-relations, for example, we are free to imagine them with different\norigins even. If they could get to _be_, and get into space at all, then\nthey may have done so separately. Once there, however, they are\n_additives_ to one another, and, with no prejudice to their natures, all\nsorts of space-relations may supervene between them. The question of\nhow things could come to be anyhow, is wholly different from the\nquestion what their relations, once the being accomplished, may consist\nin.\nMr. Bradley now affirms that such external relations as the\nspace-relations which we here talk of must hold of entirely different\nsubjects from those of which the absence of such relations might a\nmoment previously have been plausibly asserted. Not only is the\n_situation_ different when the book is on the table, but the _book\nitself_ is different as a book, from what it was when it was off the\ntable.[55] He admits that \"such external relations seem possible and\neven existing.... That you do not alter what you compare or rearrange in\nspace seems to common sense quite obvious, and that on the other side\nthere are as obvious difficulties does not occur to common sense at all.\nAnd I will begin by pointing out these difficulties.... There is a\nrelation in the result, and this relation, we hear, is to make no\ndifference in its terms. But, if so, to what does it make a difference?\n[_Doesn't it make a difference to us onlookers, at least?_] and what is\nthe meaning and sense of qualifying the terms by it? [_Surely the\nmeaning is to tell the truth about their relative position._[56]] If, in\nshort, it is external to the terms, how can it possibly be true of them?\n[_Is it the 'intimacy' suggested by the little word 'of,' here, which I\nhave underscored, that is the root of Mr. Bradley's trouble?_] ... If\nthe terms from their inner nature do not enter into the relation, then,\nso far as they are concerned, they seem related for no reason at all....\nThings are spatially related, first in one way, and then become related\nin another way, and yet in no way themselves are altered; for the\nrelations, it is said, are but external. But I reply that, if so, I can\nnot _understand_ the leaving by the terms of one set of relations and\ntheir adoption of another fresh set. The process and its result to the\nterms, if they contribute nothing to it [_Surely they contribute to it\nall there is 'of' it!_] seem irrational throughout. [_If 'irrational'\nhere means simply 'non-rational,' or nondeductible from the essence of\neither term singly, it is no reproach; if it means 'contradicting' such\nessence, Mr. Bradley should show wherein and how._] But, if they\ncontribute anything, they must surely be affected internally. [_Why so,\nif they contribute only their surface? In such relations as 'on' 'a foot\naway,' 'between,' 'next,' etc., only surfaces are in question._] ... If\nthe terms contribute anything whatever, then the terms are affected\n[_inwardly altered?_] by the arrangement.... That for working purposes\nwe treat, and do well to treat, some relations as external merely I do\nnot deny, and that of course is not the question at issue here. That\nquestion is ... whether in the end and in principle a mere external\nrelation [_i.e., a relation which can change without forcing its terms\nto change their nature simultaneously_] is possible and forced on us by\nthe facts.\"[57]\nMr. Bradley next reverts to the antinomies of space, which, according to\nhim, prove it to be unreal, although it appears as so prolific a medium\nof external relations; and he then concludes that \"Irrationality and\nexternality can not be the last truth about things. Somewhere there must\nbe a reason why this and that appear together. And this reason and\nreality must reside in the whole from which terms and relations are\nabstractions, a whole in which their internal connection must lie, and\nout of which from the background appear those fresh results which never\ncould have come from the premises.\" And he adds that \"Where the whole is\ndifferent, the terms that qualify and contribute to it must so far be\ndifferent.... They are altered so far only [_How far? farther than\nexternally, yet not through and through?_] but still they are\naltered.... I must insist that in each case the terms are qualified by\ntheir whole [_Qualified how?--Do their external relations, situations,\ndates, etc., changed as these are in the new whole, fail to qualify them\n'far' enough?_], and that in the second case there is a whole which\ndiffers both logically and psychologically from the first whole; and I\nurge that in contributing to the change the terms so far are altered.\"\nNot merely the relations, then, but the terms are altered: _und zwar_ 'so\nfar.' But just _how_ far is the whole problem; and 'through-and-through'\nwould seem (in spite of Mr. Bradley's somewhat undecided utterances[58])\nto be the full Bradleyan answer. The 'whole' which he here treats as\nprimary and determinative of each part's manner of 'contributing,' simply\n_must_, when it alters, alter in its entirety. There _must_ be total\nconflux of its parts, each into and through each other. The 'must' appears\nhere as a _Machtspruch_, as an _ipse dixit_ of Mr. Bradley's\nabsolutistically tempered 'understanding,' for he candidly confesses that\nhow the parts _do_ differ as they contribute to different wholes, is\nunknown to him.[59]\nAlthough I have every wish to comprehend the authority by which Mr.\nBradley's understanding speaks, his words leave me wholly unconverted.\n'External relations' stand with their withers all unwrung, and remain,\nfor aught he proves to the contrary, not only practically workable, but\nalso perfectly intelligible factors of reality.\nVI\nMr. Bradley's understanding shows the most extraordinary power of\nperceiving separations and the most extraordinary impotence in\ncomprehending conjunctions. One would naturally say 'neither or both,'\nbut not so Mr. Bradley. When a common man analyzes certain _whats_ from\nout the stream of experience, he understands their distinctness _as thus\nisolated_. But this does not prevent him from equally well understanding\ntheir combination with each other _as originally experienced in the\nconcrete_, or their confluence with new sensible experiences in which\nthey recur as 'the same.' Returning into the stream of sensible\npresentation, nouns and adjectives, and _thats_ and abstract _whats_,\ngrow confluent again, and the word 'is' names all these experiences of\nconjunction. Mr. Bradley understands the isolation of the abstracts, but\nto understand the combination is to him impossible.[60] \"To understand\na complex _AB_,\" he says, \"I must begin with _A_ or _B_. And beginning,\nsay with _A_, if I then merely find _B_, I have either lost _A_, or I\nhave got beside _A_, [_the word 'beside' seems here vital, as meaning a\nconjunction 'external' and therefore unintelligible_] something else,\nand in neither case have I understood.[61] For my intellect can not\nsimply unite a diversity, nor has it in itself any form or way of\ntogetherness, and you gain nothing if, beside _A_ and _B_, you offer me\ntheir conjunction in fact. For to my intellect that is no more than\nanother external element. And 'facts,' once for all, are for my\nintellect not true unless they satisfy it.... The intellect has in its\nnature no principle of mere togetherness.\"[62]\nOf course Mr. Bradley has a right to define 'intellect' as the power by\nwhich we perceive separations but not unions--provided he give due\nnotice to the reader. But why then claim that such a maimed and\namputated power must reign supreme in philosophy, and accuse on its\nbehoof the whole empirical world of irrationality? It is true that he\nelsewhere attributes to the intellect a _proprius motus_ of transition,\nbut says that when he looks for _these_ transitions in the detail of\nliving experience, he 'is unable to verify such a solution.'[63]\nYet he never explains what the intellectual transitions would be like in\ncase we had them. He only defines them negatively--they are not spatial,\ntemporal, predicative, or causal; or qualitatively or otherwise serial;\nor in any way relational as we na\u00efvely trace relations, for relations\n_separate_ terms, and need themselves to be hooked on _ad infinitum_.\nThe nearest approach he makes to describing a truly intellectual\ntransition is where he speaks of _A_ and _B_ as being 'united, each\nfrom its own nature, in a whole which is the nature of both alike.'[64]\nBut this (which, _pace_ Mr. Bradley, seems exquisitely analogous to\n'taking' a congeries in a 'lump,' if not to 'swamping') suggests nothing\nbut that _conflux_ which pure experience so abundantly offers, as when\n'space,' 'white' and 'sweet' are confluent in a 'lump of sugar,' or\nkinesthetic, dermal, and optical sensations confluent in 'my hand.'[65]\nAll that I can verify in the transitions which Mr. Bradley's intellect\ndesiderates as its _proprius motus_ is a reminiscence of these and other\nsensible conjunctions (especially space-conjunctions), but a\nreminiscence so vague that its originals are not recognized. Bradley in\nshort repeats the fable of the dog, the bone, and its image in the\nwater. With a world of particulars, given in loveliest union, in\nconjunction definitely various, and variously definite, the 'how' of\nwhich you 'understand' as soon as you see the fact of them,[66] for\nthere is no 'how' except the constitution of the fact as given; with all\nthis given him, I say, in pure experience, he asks for some ineffable\nunion in the abstract instead, which, if he gained it, would only be a\nduplicate of what he has already in his full possession. Surely he\nabuses the privilege which society grants to all us philosophers, of\nbeing puzzle-headed.\nPolemic writing like this is odious; but with absolutism in possession\nin so many quarters, omission to defend my radical empiricism against\nits best known champion would count as either superficiality or\ninability. I have to conclude that its dialectic has not invalidated in\nthe least degree the usual conjunctions by which the world, as\nexperienced, hangs so variously together. In particular it leaves an\nempirical theory of knowledge[67] intact, and lets us continue to\nbelieve with common sense that one object _may_ be known, if we have any\nground for thinking that it _is_ known, to many knowers.\nIn [the next essay] I shall return to this last supposition, which\nseems to me to offer other difficulties much harder for a philosophy of\npure experience to deal with than any of absolutism's dialectic\nobjections.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[43] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

It really seems 'weird' to have to argue (as I am forced now\nto do) for the notion that it is one sheet of paper (with its two\nsurfaces and all that lies between) which is both under my pen and on\nthe table while I write--the 'claim' that it is two sheets seems so\nbrazen. Yet I sometimes suspect the absolutists of sincerity!\n[50] [For the author's criticism of Hegel's view of relations, cf. _Will\nto Believe_, pp. 278-279. ED.]\n[51] [Cf. A.

ED.]\n[52] [See above, pp. 42, 49.]\n[53] Here again the reader must beware of slipping from logical into\nphenomenal considerations. It may well be that we _attribute_ a certain\nrelation falsely, because the circumstances of the case, being complex,\nhave deceived us. At a railway station we may take our own train, and\nnot the one that fills our window, to be moving. We here put motion in\nthe wrong place in the world, but in its original place the motion is a\npart of reality. What Mr. Bradley means is nothing like this, but rather\nthat such things as motion are nowhere real, and that, even in their\naboriginal and empirically incorrigible seats, relations are impossible\nof comprehension.\n[54] Particularly so by Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, in his _Man and\nthe Cosmos_; by L. T. Hobhouse, in chapter XII (\"The Validity of\nJudgment\") of his _Theory of Knowledge_; and by F. C. S. Schiller, in\nhis _Humanism_, essay XI. Other fatal reviews (in my opinion) are\nHodder's, in the _Psychological Review_, vol. I, [1894], p. 307; Stout's\nin the _Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society_, 1901-2, p. 1; and\nMacLennan's in [_The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific\nMethods_, vol. I, 1904, p. 403].\n[55] Once more, don't slip from logical into physical situations. Of\ncourse, if the table be wet, it will moisten the book, or if it be\nslight enough and the book heavy enough, the book will break it down.\nBut such collateral phenomena are not the point at issue. The point is\nwhether the successive relations 'on' and 'not-on' can rationally (not\nphysically) hold of the same constant terms, abstractly taken. Professor\nA. E. Taylor drops from logical into material considerations when he\ninstances color-contrast as a proof that _A_, 'as contra-distinguished\nfrom _B_, is not the same thing as mere _A_ not in any way affected'\n(_Elements of Metaphysics_, p. 145). Note the substitution, for\n'related' of the word 'affected,' which begs the whole question.\n[56] But \"is there any sense,\" asks Mr. Bradley, peevishly, on p. 579,\n\"and if so, what sense in truth that is only outside and 'about'\nthings?\" Surely such a question may be left unanswered.\n[57] _Appearance and Reality_, second edition, pp. 575-576.\n[58] I say 'undecided,' because, apart from the 'so far,' which sounds\nterribly half-hearted, there are passages in these very pages in which\nMr. Bradley admits the pluralistic thesis. Read, for example, what he\nsays, on p. 578, of a billiard ball keeping its 'character' unchanged,\nthough, in its change of place, its 'existence' gets altered; or what\nhe says, on p. 579, of the possibility that an abstract quality A, B,\nor C, in a thing, 'may throughout remain unchanged' although the thing\nbe altered; or his admission that in red-hairedness, both as analyzed\nout of a man and when given with the rest of him, there may be 'no\nchange' (p. 580). Why does he immediately add that for the pluralist\nto plead the non-mutation of such abstractions would be an _ignoratio\nelenchi_? It is impossible to admit it to be such. The entire\n_elenchus_ and inquest is just as to whether parts which you can\nabstract from existing wholes can also contribute to other wholes\nwithout changing their inner nature. If they can thus mould various\nwholes into new _gestaltqualit\u00e4ten_, then it follows that the same\nelements are logically able to exist in different wholes [whether\nphysically able would depend on additional hypotheses]; that partial\nchanges are thinkable, and through-and-through change not a dialectic\nnecessity; that monism is only an hypothesis; and that an additively\nconstituted universe is a rationally respectable hypothesis also. All\nthe theses of radical empiricism, in short, follow.\n[59] _Op. cit._, pp. 577-579.\n[60] So far as I catch his state of mind, it is somewhat like this:\n'Book,' 'table,' 'on'--how does the existence of these three abstract\nelements result in _this_ book being livingly on _this_ table. Why isn't\nthe table on the book? Or why doesn't the 'on' connect itself with\nanother book, or something that is not a table? Mustn't something _in_\neach of the three elements already determine the two others to _it_, so\nthat they do not settle elsewhere or float vaguely? Mustn't the _whole\nfact be pre-figured in each part_, and exist _de jure_ before it can\nexist _de facto_? But, if so, in what can the jural existence consist,\nif not in a spiritual miniature of the whole fact's constitution\nactuating every partial factor as its purpose? But is this anything but\nthe old metaphysical fallacy of looking behind a fact _in esse_ for the\nground of the fact, and finding it in the shape of the very same fact\n_in posse_? Somewhere we must leave off with a _constitution_ behind\nwhich there is nothing.\n[61] Apply this to the case of 'book-on-table'! W. J.\n[62] _Op. cit._, pp. 570, 572.\n[63] _Op. cit._, pp. 568, 569.\n[64] _Op. cit._, p. 570.\n[65] How meaningless is the contention that in such wholes (or in\n'book-on-table,' 'watch-in-pocket,' etc.) the relation is an additional\nentity _between_ the terms, needing itself to be related again to each!\nBoth Bradley (_op. cit._, pp. 32-33) and Royce (_The World and the\nIndividual_, vol. I, p. 128) lovingly repeat this piece of profundity.\n[66] The 'why' and the 'whence' are entirely other questions, not under\ndiscussion, as I understand Mr. Bradley. Not how experience gets itself\nborn, but how it can be what it is after it is born, is the puzzle.\n[67] Above, p. 52.\nIV\nHOW TWO MINDS CAN KNOW ONE THING[68]\nIn [the essay] entitled 'Does Consciousness Exist?' I have tried to show\nthat when we call an experience 'conscious,' that does not mean that it\nis suffused throughout with a peculiar modality of being ('psychic'\nbeing) as stained glass may be suffused with light, but rather that it\nstands in certain determinate relations to other portions of experience\nextraneous to itself. These form one peculiar 'context' for it; while,\ntaken in another context of experiences, we class it as a fact in the\nphysical world. This 'pen,' for example, is, in the first instance, a\nbald _that_, a datum, fact, phenomenon, content, or whatever other\nneutral or ambiguous name you may prefer to apply. I called it in that\narticle a 'pure experience.' To get classed either as a physical pen or\nas some one's percept of a pen, it must assume a _function_, and that\ncan only happen in a more complicated world. So far as in that world it\nis a stable feature, holds ink, marks paper and obeys the guidance of a\nhand, it is a physical pen. That is what we mean by being 'physical,' in\na pen. So far as it is instable, on the contrary, coming and going with\nthe movements of my eyes, altering with what I call my fancy, continuous\nwith subsequent experiences of its 'having been' (in the past tense), it\nis the percept of a pen in my mind. Those peculiarities are what we mean\nby being 'conscious,' in a pen.\nIn Section VI of another [essay][69] I tried to show that the same\n_that_, the same numerically identical pen of pure experience, can enter\nsimultaneously into many conscious contexts, or, in other words, be an\nobject for many different minds. I admitted that I had not space to\ntreat of certain possible objections in that article; but in [the last\nessay] I took some of the objections up. At the end of that [essay] I\nsaid that still more formidable-sounding objections remained; so, to\nleave my pure-experience theory in as strong a state as possible, I\npropose to consider those objections now.\nI\nThe objections I previously tried to dispose of were purely logical or\ndialectical. No one identical term, whether physical or psychical, it\nhad been said, could be the subject of two relations at once. This\nthesis I sought to prove unfounded. The objections that now confront us\narise from the nature supposed to inhere in psychic facts specifically.\nWhatever may be the case with physical objects, a fact of consciousness,\nit is alleged (and indeed very plausibly), can not, without\nself-contradiction, be treated as a portion of two different minds, and\nfor the following reasons.\nIn the physical world we make with impunity the assumption that one and\nthe same material object can figure in an indefinitely large number of\ndifferent processes at once. When, for instance, a sheet of rubber is\npulled at its four corners, a unit of rubber in the middle of the sheet\nis affected by all four of the pulls. It _transmits_ them each, as if\nit pulled in four different ways at once itself. So, an air-particle or\nan ether-particle 'compounds' the different directions of movement\nimprinted on it without obliterating their several individualities. It\ndelivers them distinct, on the contrary, at as many several 'receivers'\n(ear, eye or what not) as may be 'tuned' to that effect. The apparent\nparadox of a distinctness like this surviving in the midst of\ncompounding is a thing which, I fancy, the analyses made by physicists\nhave by this time sufficiently cleared up.\nBut if, on the strength of these analogies, one should ask: \"Why, if two\nor more lines can run through one and the same geometrical point, or if\ntwo or more distinct processes of activity can run through one and the\nsame physical thing so that it simultaneously plays a r\u00f4le in each and\nevery process, might not two or more streams of personal consciousness\ninclude one and the same unit of experience so that it would\nsimultaneously be a part of the experience of all the different minds?\"\none would be checked by thinking of a certain peculiarity by which\nphenomena of consciousness differ from physical things.\nWhile physical things, namely, are supposed to be permanent and to have\ntheir 'states,' a fact of consciousness exists but once and _is_ a\nstate. Its _esse_ is _sentiri_; it is only so far as it is felt; and it\nis unambiguously and unequivocally exactly _what_ is felt. The\nhypothesis under consideration would, however, oblige it to be felt\nequivocally, felt now as part of my mind and again at the same time\n_not_ as a part of my mind, but of yours (for my mind is _not_ yours),\nand this would seem impossible without doubling it into two distinct\nthings, or, in other words, without reverting to the ordinary dualistic\nphilosophy of insulated minds each knowing its object representatively\nas a third thing,--and that would be to give up the pure-experience\nscheme altogether.\nCan we see, then, any way in which a unit of pure experience might enter\ninto and figure in two diverse streams of consciousness without turning\nitself into the two units which, on our hypothesis, it must not be?\nII\nThere is a way; and the first step towards it is to see more precisely\nhow the unit enters into either one of the streams of consciousness\nalone. Just what, from being 'pure,' does its becoming 'conscious'\n_once_ mean?\nIt means, first, that new experiences have supervened; and, second, that\nthey have borne a certain assignable relation to the unit supposed.\nContinue, if you please, to speak of the pure unit as 'the pen.' So far\nas the pen's successors do but repeat the pen or, being different from\nit, are 'energetically'[70] related to it, it and they will form a group\nof stably existing physical things. So far, however, as its successors\ndiffer from it in another well-determined way, the pen will figure in\ntheir context, not as a physical, but as a mental fact. It will become a\npassing 'percept,' _my_ percept of that pen. What now is that decisive\nwell-determined way?\nIn the chapter on 'The Self,' in my _Principles of Psychology_, I\nexplained the continuous identity of each personal consciousness as a\nname for the practical fact that new experiences[71] come which look\nback on the old ones, find them 'warm,' and greet and appropriate them\nas 'mine.' These operations mean, when analyzed empirically, several\ntolerably definite things, viz.:\n1. That the new experience has past time for its 'content,' and in that\ntime a pen that 'was';\n2. That 'warmth' was also about the pen, in the sense of a group of\nfeelings ('interest' aroused, 'attention' turned, 'eyes' employed, etc.)\nthat were closely connected with it and that now recur and evermore\nrecur with unbroken vividness, though from the pen of now, which may be\nonly an image, all such vividness may have gone;\n3. That these feelings are the nucleus of 'me';\n4. That whatever once was associated with them was, at least for that\none moment, 'mine'--my implement if associated with hand-feelings, my\n'percept' only, if only eye-feelings and attention-feelings were\ninvolved.\nThe pen, realized in this retrospective way as my percept, thus figures\nas a fact of 'conscious' life. But it does so only so far as\n'appropriation' has occurred; and appropriation is _part of the content\nof a later experience_ wholly additional to the originally 'pure' pen.\n_That_ pen, virtually both objective and subjective, is at its own\nmoment actually and intrinsically neither. It has to be looked back upon\nand _used_, in order to be classed in either distinctive way. But its\nuse, so called, is in the hands of the other experience, while _it_\nstands, throughout the operation, passive and unchanged.\nIf this pass muster as an intelligible account of how an experience\noriginally pure can enter into one consciousness, the next question is\nas to how it might conceivably enter into two.\nIII\nObviously no new kind of condition would have to be supplied. All that\nwe should have to postulate would be a second subsequent experience,\ncollateral and contemporary with the first subsequent one, in which a\nsimilar act of appropriation should occur. The two acts would interfere\nneither with one another nor with the originally pure pen. It would\nsleep undisturbed in its own past, no matter how many such successors\nwent through their several appropriative acts. Each would know it as\n'my' percept, each would class it as a 'conscious' fact.\nNor need their so classing it interfere in the least with their classing\nit at the same time as a physical pen. Since the classing in both cases\ndepends upon the taking of it in one group or another of associates, if\nthe superseding experience were of wide enough 'span' it could think the\npen in both groups simultaneously, and yet distinguish the two groups.\nIt would then see the whole situation conformably to what we call 'the\nrepresentative theory of cognition,' and that is what we all\nspontaneously do. As a man philosophizing 'popularly,' I believe that\nwhat I see myself writing with is double--I think it in its relations to\nphysical nature, and also in its relations to my personal life; I see\nthat it is in my mind, but that it also is a physical pen.\nThe paradox of the same experience figuring in two consciousnesses seems\nthus no paradox at all. To be 'conscious' means not simply to be, but to\nbe reported, known, to have awareness of one's being added to that\nbeing; and this is just what happens when the appropriative experience\nsupervenes. The pen-experience in its original immediacy is not aware of\nitself, it simply _is_, and the second experience is required for what\nwe call awareness of it to occur.[72] The difficulty of understanding\nwhat happens here is, therefore, not a logical difficulty: there is no\ncontradiction involved. It is an ontological difficulty rather.\nExperiences come on an enormous scale, and if we take them all\ntogether, they come in a chaos of incommensurable relations that we can\nnot straighten out. We have to abstract different groups of them, and\nhandle these separately if we are to talk of them at all. But how the\nexperiences ever _get themselves made_, or _why_ their characters and\nrelations are just such as appear, we can not begin to understand.\nGranting, however, that, by hook or crook, they _can_ get themselves\nmade, and can appear in the successions that I have so schematically\ndescribed, then we have to confess that even although (as I began by\nquoting from the adversary) 'a feeling only is as it is felt,' there is\nstill nothing absurd in the notion of its being felt in two different\nways at once, as yours, namely, and as mine. It is, indeed, 'mine' only\nas it is felt as mine, and 'yours' only as it is felt as yours. But it\nis felt as neither _by itself_, but only when 'owned' by our two several\nremembering experiences, just as one undivided estate is owned by\nseveral heirs.\nIV\nOne word, now, before I close, about the corollaries of the views set\nforth. Since the acquisition of conscious quality on the part of an\nexperience depends upon a context coming to it, it follows that the sum\ntotal of all experiences, having no context, can not strictly be called\nconscious at all. It is a _that_, an Absolute, a 'pure' experience on an\nenormous scale, undifferentiated and undifferentiable into thought and\nthing. This the post-Kantian idealists have always practically\nacknowledged by calling their doctrine an _Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_. The\nquestion of the _Beseelung_ of the All of things ought not, then, even\nto be asked. No more ought the question of its _truth_ to be asked, for\ntruth is a relation inside of the sum total, obtaining between thoughts\nand something else, and thoughts, as we have seen, can only be\ncontextual things. In these respects the pure experiences of our\nphilosophy are, in themselves considered, so many little absolutes, the\nphilosophy of pure experience being only a more comminuted\n_Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_.[73]\nMeanwhile, a pure experience can be postulated with any amount whatever\nof span or field. If it exert the retrospective and appropriative\nfunction on any other piece of experience, the latter thereby enters\ninto its own conscious stream. And in this operation time intervals make\nno essential difference. After sleeping, my retrospection is as perfect\nas it is between two successive waking moments of my time. Accordingly\nif, millions of years later, a similarly retrospective experience should\nanyhow come to birth, my present thought would form a genuine portion of\nits long-span conscious life. 'Form a portion,' I say, but not in the\nsense that the two things could be entitatively or substantively\none--they cannot, for they are numerically discrete facts--but only in\nthe sense that the _functions_ of my present thought, its knowledge, its\npurpose, its content and 'consciousness,' in short, being inherited,\nwould be continued practically unchanged. Speculations like Fechner's,\nof an Earth-soul, of wider spans of consciousness enveloping narrower\nones throughout the cosmos, are, therefore, philosophically quite in\norder, provided they distinguish the functional from the entitative\npoint of view, and do not treat the minor consciousness under discussion\nas a kind of standing material of which the wider ones _consist_.[74]\nFOOTNOTES:\n[68] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

V, 'The Compounding of Consciousness.']\nV\nTHE PLACE OF AFFECTIONAL FACTS IN A WORLD OF PURE EXPERIENCE[75]\nCommon sense and popular philosophy are as dualistic as it is possible\nto be. Thoughts, we all naturally think, are made of one kind of\nsubstance, and things of another. Consciousness, flowing inside of us in\nthe forms of conception or judgment, or concentrating itself in the\nshape of passion or emotion, can be directly felt as the spiritual\nactivity which it is, and known in contrast with the space-filling\nobjective 'content' which it envelopes and accompanies. In opposition to\nthis dualistic philosophy, I tried, in [the first essay] to show that\nthoughts and things are absolutely homogeneous as to their material, and\nthat their opposition is only one of relation and of function. There is\nno thought-stuff different from thing-stuff, I said; but the same\nidentical piece of 'pure experience' (which was the name I gave to the\n_materia prima_ of everything) can stand alternately for a 'fact of\nconsciousness' or for a physical reality, according as it is taken in\none context or in another. For the right understanding of what follows,\nI shall have to presuppose that the reader will have read that\n[essay].[76]\nThe commonest objection which the doctrine there laid down runs up\nagainst is drawn from the existence of our 'affections.' In our\npleasures and pains, our loves and fears and angers, in the beauty,\ncomicality, importance or preciousness of certain objects and\nsituations, we have, I am told by many critics, a great realm of\nexperience intuitively recognized as spiritual, made, and felt to be\nmade, of consciousness exclusively, and different in nature from the\nspace-filling kind of being which is enjoyed by physical objects. In\nSection VII. of [the first essay], I treated of this class of\nexperiences very inadequately, because I had to be so brief. I now\nreturn to the subject, because I believe that, so far from invalidating\nmy general thesis, these phenomena, when properly analyzed, afford it\npowerful support.\nThe central point of the pure-experience theory is that 'outer' and\n'inner' are names for two groups into which we sort experiences\naccording to the way in which they act upon their neighbors. Any one\n'content,' such as _hard_, let us say, can be assigned to either group.\nIn the outer group it is 'strong,' it acts 'energetically' and\naggressively. Here whatever is hard interferes with the space its\nneighbors occupy. It dents them; is impenetrable by them; and we call\nthe hardness then a physical hardness. In the mind, on the contrary, the\nhard thing is nowhere in particular, it dents nothing, it suffuses\nthrough its mental neighbors, as it were, and interpenetrates them.\nTaken in this group we call both it and them 'ideas' or 'sensations';\nand the basis of the two groups respectively is the different type of\ninterrelation, the mutual impenetrability, on the one hand, and the\nlack of physical interference and interaction, on the other.\nThat what in itself is one and the same entity should be able to\nfunction thus differently in different contexts is a natural consequence\nof the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come. To\nher offspring a tigress is tender, but cruel to every other living\nthing--both cruel and tender, therefore, at once. A mass in movement\nresists every force that operates contrariwise to its own direction, but\nto forces that pursue the same direction, or come in at right angles, it\nis absolutely inert. It is thus both energetic and inert; and the same\nis true (if you vary the associates properly) of every other piece of\nexperience. It is only towards certain specific groups of associates\nthat the physical energies, as we call them, of a content are put forth.\nIn another group it may be quite inert.\nIt is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only\nalternative between neighbors would be either physical interaction or\ncomplete inertness. In such a world the mental or the physical _status_\nof any piece of experience would be unequivocal. When active, it would\nfigure in the physical, and when inactive, in the mental group.\nBut the universe we live in is more chaotic than this, and there is room\nin it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our affectional experiences,\nof our emotions and appreciative perceptions. In the paragraphs that\nfollow I shall try to show:\n(1) That the popular notion that these experiences are intuitively given\nas purely inner facts is hasty and erroneous; and\n(2) That their ambiguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that\nsubjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of what an experience is\naboriginally made of, but of its classification. Classifications depend\non our temporary purposes. For certain purposes it is convenient to take\nthings in one set of relations, for other purposes in another set. In\nthe two cases their contexts are apt to be different. In the case of our\naffectional experiences we have no permanent and steadfast purpose that\nobliges us to be consistent, so we find it easy to let them float\nambiguously, sometimes classing them with our feelings, sometimes with\nmore physical realities, according to caprice or to the convenience of\nthe moment. Thus would these experiences, so far from being an obstacle\nto the pure experience philosophy, serve as an excellent corroboration\nof its truth.\nFirst of all, then, it is a mistake to say, with the objectors whom I\nbegan by citing, that anger, love and fear are affections purely of the\nmind. That, to a great extent at any rate, they are simultaneously\naffections of the body is proved by the whole literature of the\nJames-Lange theory of emotion.[77] All our pains, moreover, are local,\nand we are always free to speak of them in objective as well as in\nsubjective terms. We can say that we are aware of a painful place,\nfilling a certain bigness in our organism, or we can say that we are\ninwardly in a 'state' of pain. All our adjectives of worth are\nsimilarly ambiguous--I instanced some of the ambiguities [in the first\nessay].[78] Is the preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem? or is\nit a feeling in our mind? Practically we treat it as both or as either,\naccording to the temporary direction of our thought. 'Beauty,' says\nProfessor Santayana, 'is pleasure objectified'; and in Sections 10 and\n11 of his work, _The Sense of Beauty_, he treats in a masterly way of\nthis equivocal realm. The various pleasures we receive from an object\nmay count as 'feelings' when we take them singly, but when they combine\nin a total richness, we call the result the 'beauty' of the object, and\ntreat it as an outer attribute which our mind perceives. We discover\nbeauty just as we discover the physical properties of things. Training\nis needed to make us expert in either line. Single sensations also may\nbe ambiguous. Shall we say an 'agreeable degree of heat,' or an\n'agreeable feeling' occasioned by the degree of heat? Either will do;\nand language would lose most of its esthetic and rhetorical value were\nwe forbidden to project words primarily connoting our affections upon\nthe objects by which the affections are aroused. The man is really\nhateful; the action really mean; the situation really tragic--all in\nthemselves and quite apart from our opinion. We even go so far as to\ntalk of a weary road, a giddy height, a jocund morning or a sullen sky;\nand the term 'indefinite' while usually applied only to our\napprehensions, functions as a fundamental physical qualification of\nthings in Spencer's 'law of evolution,' and doubtless passes with most\nreaders for all right.\nPsychologists, studying our perceptions of movement, have unearthed\nexperiences in which movement is felt in general but not ascribed\ncorrectly to the body that really moves. Thus in optical vertigo, caused\nby unconscious movements of our eyes, both we and the external universe\nappear to be in a whirl. When clouds float by the moon, it is as if both\nclouds and moon and we ourselves shared in the motion. In the\nextraordinary case of amnesia of the Rev. Mr. Hanna, published by Sidis\nand Goodhart in their important work on _Multiple Personality_, we read\nthat when the patient first recovered consciousness and \"noticed an\nattendant walk across the room, he identified the movement with that of\nhis own. He did not yet discriminate between his own movements and those\noutside himself.\"[79] Such experiences point to a primitive stage of\nperception in which discriminations afterwards needful have not yet been\nmade. A piece of experience of a determinate sort is there, but there at\nfirst as a 'pure' fact. Motion originally simply _is_; only later is it\nconfined to this thing or to that. Something like this is true of every\nexperience, however complex, at the moment of its actual presence. Let\nthe reader arrest himself in the act of reading this article now. _Now_\nthis is a pure experience, a phenomenon, or datum, a mere _that_ or\ncontent of fact. _'Reading' simply is, is there_; and whether there for\nsome one's consciousness, or there for physical nature, is a question\nnot yet put. At the moment, it is there for neither; later we shall\nprobably judge it to have been there for both.\nWith the affectional experiences which we are considering, the\nrelatively 'pure' condition lasts. In practical life no urgent need has\nyet arisen for deciding whether to treat them as rigorously mental or as\nrigorously physical facts. So they remain equivocal; and, as the world\ngoes, their equivocality is one of their great conveniences.\nThe shifting place of 'secondary qualities' in the history of\nphilosophy[80] is another excellent proof of the fact that 'inner' and\n'outer' are not coefficients with which experiences come to us\naboriginally stamped, but are rather results of a later classification\nperformed by us for particular needs. The common-sense stage of thought\nis a perfectly definite practical halting-place, the place where we\nourselves can proceed to act unhesitatingly. On this stage of thought\nthings act on each other as well as on us by means of their secondary\nqualities. Sound, as such, goes through the air and can be intercepted.\nThe heat of the fire passes over, as such, into the water which it sets\na-boiling. It is the very light of the arc-lamp which displaces the\ndarkness of the midnight street, etc. By engendering and translocating\njust these qualities, actively efficacious as they seem to be, we\nourselves succeed in altering nature so as to suit us; and until more\npurely intellectual, as distinguished from practical, needs had arisen,\nno one ever thought of calling these qualities subjective. When,\nhowever, Galileo, Descartes, and others found it best for philosophic\npurposes to class sound, heat, and light along with pain and pleasure as\npurely mental phenomena, they could do so with impunity.[81]\nEven the primary qualities are undergoing the same fate. Hardness and\nsoftness are effects on us of atomic interactions, and the atoms\nthemselves are neither hard nor soft, nor solid nor liquid. Size and\nshape are deemed subjective by Kantians; time itself is subjective\naccording to many philosophers;[82] and even the activity and causal\nefficacy which lingered in physics long after secondary qualities were\nbanished are now treated as illusory projections outwards of phenomena\nof our own consciousness. There are no activities or effects in nature,\nfor the most intellectual contemporary school of physical speculation.\nNature exhibits only _changes_, which habitually coincide with one\nanother so that their habits are describable in simple 'laws.'[83]\nThere is no original spirituality or materiality of being, intuitively\ndiscerned, then; but only a translocation of experiences from one world\nto another; a grouping of them with one set or another of associates for\ndefinitely practical or intellectual ends.\nI will say nothing here of the persistent ambiguity of _relations_. They\nare undeniable parts of pure experience; yet, while common sense and\nwhat I call radical empiricism stand for their being objective, both\nrationalism and the usual empiricism claim that they are exclusively the\n'work of the mind'--the finite mind or the absolute mind, as the case\nmay be.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTurn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us.\nWe soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our\ninterests and emotions from the ways in which they act upon one another.\nIt does not _work_ to assume that physical objects are going to act\noutwardly by their sympathetic or antipathetic qualities. The beauty of\na thing or its value is no force that can be plotted in a polygon of\ncompositions, nor does its 'use' or 'significance' affect in the\nminutest degree its vicissitudes or destiny at the hands of physical\nnature. Chemical 'affinities' are a purely verbal metaphor; and, as I\njust said, even such things as forces, tensions, and activities can at a\npinch be regarded as anthropomorphic projections. So far, then, as the\nphysical world means the collection of contents that determine in each\nother certain regular changes, the whole collection of our appreciative\nattributes has to be treated as falling outside of it. If we mean by\nphysical nature whatever lies beyond the surface of our bodies, these\nattributes are inert throughout the whole extent of physical nature.\nWhy then do men leave them as ambiguous as they do, and not class them\ndecisively as purely spiritual?\nThe reason would seem to be that, although they are inert as regards the\nrest of physical nature, they are not inert as regards that part of\nphysical nature which our own skin covers. It is those very appreciative\nattributes of things, their dangerousness, beauty, rarity, utility,\netc., that primarily appeal to our attention. In our commerce with\nnature these attributes are what give _emphasis_ to objects; and for an\nobject to be emphatic, whatever spiritual fact it may mean, means also\nthat it produces immediate bodily effects upon us, alterations of tone\nand tension, of heart-beat and breathing, of vascular and visceral\naction. The 'interesting' aspects of things are thus not wholly inert\nphysically, though they be active only in these small corners of\nphysical nature which our bodies occupy. That, however, is enough to\nsave them from being classed as absolutely non-objective.\nThe attempt, if any one should make it, to sort experiences into two\nabsolutely discrete groups, with nothing but inertness in one of them\nand nothing but activities in the other, would thus receive one check.\nIt would receive another as soon as we examined the more distinctively\nmental group; for though in that group it be true that things do not act\non one another by their physical properties, do not dent each other or\nset fire to each other, they yet act on each other in the most energetic\nway by those very characters which are so inert extracorporeally. It is\nby the interest and importance that experiences have for us, by the\nemotions they excite, and the purposes they subserve, by their affective\nvalues, in short, that their consecution in our several conscious\nstreams, as 'thoughts' of ours, is mainly ruled. Desire introduces them;\ninterest holds them; fitness fixes their order and connection. I need\nonly refer for this aspect of our mental life, to Wundt's article 'Ueber\npsychische Causalit\u00e4t,' which begins Volume X. of his _Philosophische\nStudien_.[84]\nIt thus appears that the ambiguous or amphibious _status_ which we find\nour epithets of value occupying is the most natural thing in the world.\nIt would, however, be an unnatural status if the popular opinion which I\ncited at the outset were correct. If 'physical' and 'mental' meant two\ndifferent kinds of intrinsic nature, immediately, intuitively, and\ninfallibly discernible, and each fixed forever in whatever bit of\nexperience it qualified, one does not see how there could ever have\narisen any room for doubt or ambiguity. But if, on the contrary, these\nwords are words of sorting, ambiguity is natural. For then, as soon as\nthe relations of a thing are sufficiently various it can be sorted\nvariously. Take a mass of carrion, for example, and the\n'disgustingness' which for us is part of the experience. The sun\ncaresses it, and the zephyr wooes it as if it were a bed of roses. So\nthe disgustingness fails to _operate_ within the realm of suns and\nbreezes,--it does not function as a physical quality. But the carrion\n'turns our stomach' by what seems a direct operation--it _does_ function\nphysically, therefore, in that limited part of physics. We can treat it\nas physical or as non-physical according as we take it in the narrower\nor in the wider context, and conversely, of course, we must treat it as\nnon-mental or as mental.\nOur body itself is the palmary instance of the ambiguous. Sometimes I\ntreat my body purely as a part of outer nature. Sometimes, again, I\nthink of it as 'mine,' I sort it with the 'me,' and then certain local\nchanges and determinations in it pass for spiritual happenings. Its\nbreathing is my 'thinking,' its sensorial adjustments are my\n'attention,' its kinesthetic alterations are my 'efforts,' its visceral\nperturbations are my 'emotions.' The obstinate controversies that have\narisen over such statements as these (which sound so paradoxical, and\nwhich can yet be made so seriously) prove how hard it is to decide by\nbare introspection what it is in experiences that shall make them either\nspiritual or material. It surely can be nothing intrinsic in the\nindividual experience. It is their way of behaving towards each other,\ntheir system of relations, their function; and all these things vary\nwith the context in which we find it opportune to consider them.\nI think I may conclude, then (and I hope that my readers are now ready\nto conclude with me), that the pretended spirituality of our emotions\nand of our attributes of value, so far from proving an objection to the\nphilosophy of pure experience, does, when rightly discussed and\naccounted for, serve as one of its best corroborations.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[75] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Professor Woodbridge's _Journal\nof Philosophy_[86] seems unintentionally to have become a sort of\nmeeting place for those who follow these tendencies in America. There is\nonly a dim identity among them; and the most that can be said at present\nis that some sort of gestation seems to be in the atmosphere, and that\nalmost any day a man with a genius for finding the right word for things\nmay hit upon some unifying and conciliating formula that will make so\nmuch vaguely similar aspiration crystallize into more definite form.\nI myself have given the name of 'radical empiricism' to that version of\nthe tendency in question which I prefer; and I propose, if you will now\nlet me, to illustrate what I mean by radical empiricism, by applying it\nto activity as an example, hoping at the same time incidentally to\nleave the general problem of activity in a slightly--I fear very\nslightly--more manageable shape than before.\nMr. Bradley calls the question of activity a scandal to philosophy, and\nif one turns to the current literature of the subject--his own writings\nincluded--one easily gathers what he means. The opponents cannot even\nunderstand one another. Mr. Bradley says to Mr. Ward: \"I do not care\nwhat your oracle is, and your preposterous psychology may here be gospel\nif you please; ... but if the revelation does contain a meaning, I will\ncommit myself to this: either the oracle is so confused that its\nsignification is not discoverable, or, upon the other hand, if it can be\npinned down to any definite statement, then that statement will be\nfalse.\"[87] Mr. Ward in turn says of Mr. Bradley: \"I cannot even imagine\nthe state of mind to which his description applies.... [It] reads like\nan unintentional travesty of Herbartian psychology by one who has tried\nto improve upon it without being at the pains to master it.\"[88]\nM\u00fcnsterberg excludes a view opposed to his own by saying that with any\none who holds it a _Verst\u00e4ndigung_ with him is \"_grunds\u00e4tzlich\nausgeschlossen_\"; and Royce, in a review of Stout,[89] hauls him over\nthe coals at great length for defending 'efficacy' in a way which I, for\none, never gathered from reading him, and which I have heard Stout\nhimself say was quite foreign to the intention of his text.\nIn these discussions distinct questions are habitually jumbled and\ndifferent points of view are talked of _durcheinander_.\n(1) There is a psychological question: \"Have we perceptions of activity?\nand if so, what are they like, and when and where do we have them?\"\n(2) There is a metaphysical question: \"Is there a _fact_ of activity?\nand if so, what idea must we frame of it? What is it like? and what\ndoes it do, if it does anything?\" And finally there is a logical\nquestion:\n(3) \"Whence do we _know_ activity? By our own feelings of it solely? or\nby some other source of information?\" Throughout page after page of the\nliterature one knows not which of these questions is before one; and\nmere description of the surface-show of experience is proferred as if it\nimplicitly answered every one of them. No one of the disputants,\nmoreover, tries to show what pragmatic consequences his own view would\ncarry, or what assignable particular differences in any one's experience\nit would make if his adversary's were triumphant.\nIt seems to me that if radical empiricism be good for anything, it\nought, with its pragmatic method and its principle of pure experience,\nto be able to avoid such tangles, or at least to simplify them somewhat.\nThe pragmatic method starts from the postulate that there is no\ndifference of truth that doesn't make a difference of fact somewhere;\nand it seeks to determine the meaning of all differences of opinion by\nmaking the discussion hinge as soon as possible upon some practical or\nparticular issue. The principle of pure experience is also a methodical\npostulate. Nothing shall be admitted as fact, it says, except what can\nbe experienced at some definite time by some experient; and for every\nfeature of fact ever so experienced, a definite place must be found\nsomewhere in the final system of reality. In other words: Everything\nreal must be experienceable somewhere, and every kind of thing\nexperienced must somewhere be real.\nArmed with these rules of method let us see what face the problems of\nactivity present to us.\nBy the principle of pure experience, either the word 'activity' must\nhave no meaning at all, or else the original type and model of what it\nmeans must lie in some concrete kind of experience that can be\ndefinitely pointed out. Whatever ulterior judgments we may eventually\ncome to make regarding activity, _that sort_ of thing will be what the\njudgments are about. The first step to take, then, is to ask where in\nthe stream of experience we seem to find what we speak of as activity.\nWhat we are to think of the activity thus found will be a later\nquestion.\nNow it is obvious that we are tempted to affirm activity wherever we\nfind anything _going on_. Taken in the broadest sense, any apprehension\nof something _doing_, is an experience of activity. Were our world\ndescribable only by the words 'nothing happening,' 'nothing changing,'\n'nothing doing,' we should unquestionably call it an 'inactive' world.\nBare activity then, as we may call it, means the bare fact of event or\nchange. 'Change taking place' is a unique content of experience, one of\nthose 'conjunctive' objects which radical empiricism seeks so earnestly\nto rehabilitate and preserve. The sense of activity is thus in the\nbroadest and vaguest way synonymous with the sense of 'life.' We should\nfeel our own subjective life at least, even in noticing and proclaiming\nan otherwise inactive world. Our own reaction on its monotony would be\nthe one thing experienced there in the form of something coming to\npass.\nThis seems to be what certain writers have in mind when they insist that\nfor an experient to be at all is to be active. It seems to justify, or\nat any rate to explain, Mr. Ward's expression that we _are_ only as we\nare active,[90] for we _are_ only as experients; and it rules out Mr.\nBradley's contention that \"there is no original experience of anything\nlike activity.\"[91] What we ought to say about activities thus\nelementary, whose they are, what they effect, or whether indeed they\neffect anything at all--these are later questions, to be answered only\nwhen the field of experience is enlarged.\nBare activity would thus be predicable, though there were no definite\ndirection, no actor, and no aim. Mere restless zigzag movement, or a\nwild _Ideenflucht_, or _Rhapsodie der Wahrnehmungen_, as Kant would\nsay,[92] would constitute an active as distinguished from an inactive\nworld.\nBut in this actual world of ours, as it is given, a part at least of\nthe activity comes with definite direction; it comes with desire and\nsense of goal; it comes complicated with resistances which it\novercomes or succumbs to, and with the efforts which the feeling of\nresistance so often provokes; and it is in complex experiences like\nthese that the notions of distinct agents, and of passivity as opposed\nto activity arise. Here also the notion of causal efficacy comes to\nbirth. Perhaps the most elaborate work ever done in descriptive\npsychology has been the analysis by various recent writers of the more\ncomplex activity-situations.[93] In their descriptions, exquisitely\nsubtle some of them,[94] the activity appears as the _gestaltqualit\u00e4t_\nor the _fundirte inhalt_ (or as whatever else you may please to call\nthe conjunctive form) which the content falls into when we experience\nit in the ways which the describers set forth. Those factors in those\nrelations are what we mean by activity-situations; and to the possible\nenumeration and accumulation of their circumstances and ingredients\nthere would seem to be no natural bound. Every hour of human life\ncould contribute to the picture gallery; and this is the only fault\nthat one can find with such descriptive industry--where is it going to\nstop? Ought we to listen forever to verbal pictures of what we have\nalready in concrete form in our own breasts?[95] They never take us\noff the superficial plane. We knew the facts already--less spread out\nand separated, to be sure--but we knew them still. We always felt our\nown activity, for example, as 'the expansion of an idea with which our\nSelf is identified, against an obstacle';[96] and the following out of\nsuch a definition through a multitude of cases elaborates the obvious\nso as to be little more than an exercise in synonymic speech.\nAll the descriptions have to trace familiar outlines, and to use\nfamiliar terms. The activity is, for example, attributed either to a\nphysical or to a mental agent, and is either aimless or directed. If\ndirected it shows tendency. The tendency may or may not be resisted. If\nnot, we call the activity immanent, as when a body moves in empty space\nby its momentum, or our thoughts wander at their own sweet will. If\nresistance is met, _its_ agent complicates the situation. If now, in\nspite of resistance, the original tendency continues, effort makes its\nappearance, and along with effort, strain or squeeze. Will, in the\nnarrower sense of the word, then comes upon the scene, whenever, along\nwith the tendency, the strain and squeeze are sustained. But the\nresistance may be great enough to check the tendency, or even to reverse\nits path. In that case, we (if 'we' were the original agents or subjects\nof the tendency) are overpowered. The phenomenon turns into one of\ntension simply, or of necessity succumbed-to, according as the opposing\npower is only equal, or is superior to ourselves.\nWhosoever describes an experience in such terms as these describes an\nexperience _of_ activity. If the word have any meaning, it must denote\nwhat there is found. _There_ is complete activity in its original and\nfirst intention. What it is 'known-as' is what there appears. The\nexperiencer of such a situation possesses all that the idea contains. He\nfeels the tendency, the obstacle, the will, the strain, the triumph, or\nthe passive giving up, just as he feels the time, the space, the\nswiftness or intensity, the movement, the weight and color, the pain and\npleasure, the complexity, or whatever remaining characters the situation\nmay involve. He goes through all that ever can be imagined where\nactivity is supposed. If we suppose activities to go on outside of our\nexperience, it is in forms like these that we must suppose them, or else\ngive them some other name; for the word 'activity' has no imaginable\ncontent whatever save these experiences of process, obstruction,\nstriving, strain, or release, ultimate _qualia_ as they are of the life\ngiven us to be known.\nWere this the end of the matter, one might think that whenever we had\nsuccessfully lived through an activity-situation we should have to be\npermitted, without provoking contradiction, to say that we had been\nreally active, that we had met real resistance and had really prevailed.\nLotze somewhere says that to be an entity all that is necessary is to\n_gelten_ as an entity, to operate, or be felt, experienced, recognized,\nor in any way realized, as such.[97] In our activity-experiences the\nactivity assuredly fulfils Lotze's demand. It makes itself _gelten_. It\nis witnessed at its work. No matter what activities there may really be\nin this extraordinary universe of ours, it is impossible for us to\nconceive of any one of them being either lived through or authentically\nknown otherwise than in this dramatic shape of something sustaining a\nfelt purpose against felt obstacles and overcoming or being overcome.\nWhat 'sustaining' means here is clear to anyone who has lived through\nthe experience, but to no one else; just as 'loud,' 'red,' 'sweet,' mean\nsomething only to beings with ears, eyes, and tongues. The _percipi_ in\nthese originals of experience is the _esse_; the curtain is the picture.\nIf there is anything hiding in the background, it ought not to be called\nactivity, but should get itself another name.\nThis seems so obviously true that one might well experience astonishment\nat finding so many of the ablest writers on the subject flatly denying\nthat the activity we live through in these situations is real. Merely to\nfeel active is not to be active, in their sight. The agents that appear\nin the experience are not real agents, the resistances do not really\nresist, the effects that appear are not really effects at all.[98] It\nis evident from this that mere descriptive analysis of any one of our\nactivity-experiences is not the whole story, that there is something\nstill to tell _about_ them that has led such able writers to conceive of\na _Simon-pure_ activity, of an activity _an sich_, that does, and\ndoesn't merely appear to us to do, and compared with whose real doing\nall this phenomenal activity is but a specious sham.\nThe metaphysical question opens here; and I think that the state of mind\nof one possessed by it is often something like this: \"It is all very\nwell,\" we may imagine him saying, \"to talk about certain\nexperience-series taking on the form of feelings of activity, just as\nthey might take on musical or geometric forms. Suppose that they do so;\nsuppose we feel a will to stand a strain. Does our feeling do more than\n_record_ the fact that the strain is sustained? The _real_ activity,\nmeanwhile, is the _doing_ of the fact; and what is the doing made of\nbefore the record is made. What in the will _enables_ it to act thus?\nAnd these trains of experience themselves, in which activities appear,\nwhat makes them _go_ at all? Does the activity in one bit of experience\nbring the next bit into being? As an empiricist you cannot say so, for\nyou have just declared activity to be only a kind of synthetic object,\nor conjunctive relation experienced between bits of experience already\nmade. But what made them at all? What propels experience _\u00fcberhaupt_\ninto being? _There_ is the activity that _operates_; the activity _felt_\nis only its superficial sign.\"\nTo the metaphysical question, popped upon us in this way, I must pay\nserious attention ere I end my remarks; but, before doing so, let me\nshow that without leaving the immediate reticulations of experience, or\nasking what makes activity itself act, we still find the distinction\nbetween less real and more real activities forced upon us, and are\ndriven to much soul-searching on the purely phenomenal plane.\nWe must not forget, namely, in talking of the ultimate character of our\nactivity-experiences, that each of them is but a portion of a wider\nworld, one link in the vast chain of processes of experience out of\nwhich history is made. Each partial process, to him who lives through\nit, defines itself by its origin and its goal; but to an observer with\na wider mind-span who should live outside of it, that goal would appear\nbut as a provisional halting-place, and the subjectively felt activity\nwould be seen to continue into objective activities that led far beyond.\nWe thus acquire a habit, in discussing activity-experiences, of defining\nthem by their relation to something more. If an experience be one of\nnarrow span, it will be mistaken as to what activity it is and whose.\nYou think that _you_ are acting while you are only obeying someone's\npush. You think you are doing _this_, but you are doing something of\nwhich you do not dream. For instance, you think you are but drinking\nthis glass; but you are really creating the liver-cirrhosis that will\nend your days. You think you are just driving this bargain, but, as\nStevenson says somewhere, you are laying down a link in the policy of\nmankind.\nGenerally speaking, the onlooker, with his wider field of vision,\nregards the _ultimate outcome_ of an activity as what it is more really\ndoing; and _the most previous agent_ ascertainable, being the first\nsource of action, he regards as the most real agent in the field. The\nothers but transmit that agent's impulse; on him we put responsibility;\nwe name him when one asks us 'Who's to blame?'\nBut the most previous agents ascertainable, instead of being of longer\nspan, are often of much shorter span than the activity in view.\nBrain-cells are our best example. My brain-cells are believed to excite\neach other from next to next (by contiguous transmission of katabolic\nalteration, let us say) and to have been doing so long before this\npresent stretch of lecturing-activity on my part began. If any one\ncell-group stops its activity, the lecturing will cease or show disorder\nof form. _Cessante causa, cessat et effectus_--does not this look as if\nthe short-span brain activities were the more real activities, and the\nlecturing activities on my part only their effects? Moreover, as Hume so\nclearly pointed out,[99] in my mental activity-situation the words\nphysically to be uttered are represented as the activity's immediate\ngoal. These words, however, cannot be uttered without intermediate\nphysical processes in the bulb and vagi nerves, which processes\nnevertheless fail to figure in the mental activity-series at all. That\nseries, therefore, since it leaves out vitally real steps of action,\ncannot represent the real activities. It is something purely subjective;\nthe _facts_ of activity are elsewhere. They are something far more\ninterstitial, so to speak, than what my feelings record.\nThe _real_ facts of activity that have in point of fact been\nsystematically pleaded for by philosophers have, so far as my\ninformation goes, been of three principal types.\nThe first type takes a consciousness of wider time-span than ours to be\nthe vehicle of the more real activity. Its will is the agent, and its\npurpose is the action done.\nThe second type assumes that 'ideas' struggling with one another are the\nagents, and that the prevalence of one set of them is the action.\nThe third type believes that nerve-cells are the agents, and that\nresultant motor discharges are the acts achieved.\nNow if we must de-realize our immediately felt activity-situations for\nthe benefit of either of these types of substitute, we ought to know\nwhat the substitution practically involves. _What practical difference\nought it to make if_, instead of saying na\u00efvely that 'I' am active now\nin delivering this address, I say that _a wider thinker is active_, or\nthat _certain ideas are active_, or that _certain nerve-cells are\nactive_, in producing the result?\nThis would be the pragmatic meaning of the three hypotheses. Let us take\nthem in succession in seeking a reply.\nIf we assume a wider thinker, it is evident that his purposes envelope\nmine. I am really lecturing _for_ him; and although I cannot surely know\nto what end, yet if I take him religiously, I can trust it to be a good\nend, and willingly connive. I can be happy in thinking that my activity\ntransmits his impulse, and that his ends prolong my own. So long as I\ntake him religiously, in short, he does not de-realize my activities.\nHe tends rather to corroborate the reality of them, so long as I believe\nboth them and him to be good.\nWhen now we turn to ideas, the case is different, inasmuch as ideas are\nsupposed by the association psychology to influence each other only from\nnext to next. The 'span' of an idea or pair of ideas, is assumed to be\nmuch smaller instead of being larger than that of my total conscious\nfield. The same results may get worked out in both cases, for this\naddress is being given anyhow. But the ideas supposed to 'really' work\nit out had no prevision of the whole of it; and if I was lecturing for\nan absolute thinker in the former case, so, by similar reasoning, are my\nideas now lecturing for me, that is, accomplishing unwittingly a result\nwhich I approve and adopt. But, when this passing lecture is over, there\nis nothing in the bare notion that ideas have been its agents that would\nseem to guarantee that my present purposes in lecturing will be\nprolonged. _I_ may have ulterior developments in view; but there is no\ncertainty that my ideas as such will wish to, or be able to, work them\nout.\nThe like is true if nerve-cells be the agents. The activity of a\nnerve-cell must be conceived of as a tendency of exceedingly short\nreach, an 'impulse' barely spanning the way to the next cell--for surely\nthat amount of actual 'process' must be 'experienced' by the cells if\nwhat happens between them is to deserve the name of activity at all. But\nhere again the gross resultant, as _I_ perceive it, is indifferent to\nthe agents, and neither wished or willed or foreseen. Their being agents\nnow congruous with my will gives me no guarantee that like results will\nrecur again from their activity. In point of fact, all sorts of other\nresults do occur. My mistakes, impotencies, perversions, mental\nobstructions, and frustrations generally, are also results of the\nactivity of cells. Although these are letting me lecture now, on other\noccasions they make me do things that I would willingly not do.\nThe question _Whose is the real activity?_ is thus tantamount to the\nquestion _What will be the actual results?_ Its interest is dramatic;\nhow will things work out? If the agents are of one sort, one way; if of\nanother sort, they may work out very differently. The pragmatic meaning\nof the various alternatives, in short, is great. It makes no merely\nverbal difference which opinion we take up.\nYou see it is the old dispute come back! Materialism and teleology;\nelementary short-span actions summing themselves 'blindly,' or far\nforeseen ideals coming with effort into act.\nNa\u00efvely we believe, and humanly and dramatically we like to believe,\nthat activities both of wider and of narrower span are at work in life\ntogether, that both are real, and that the long-span tendencies yoke the\nothers in their service, encouraging them in the right direction, and\ndamping them when they tend in other ways. But how to represent clearly\nthe _modus operandi_ of such steering of small tendencies by large ones\nis a problem which metaphysical thinkers will have to ruminate upon for\nmany years to come. Even if such control should eventually grow clearly\npicturable, the question how far it is successfully exerted in this\nactual world can be answered only by investigating the details of fact.\nNo philosophic knowledge of the general nature and constitution of\ntendencies, or of the relation of larger to smaller ones, can help us to\npredict which of all the various competing tendencies that interest us\nin this universe are likeliest to prevail. We know as an empirical fact\nthat far-seeing tendencies often carry out their purpose, but we know\nalso that they are often defeated by the failure of some contemptibly\nsmall process on which success depends. A little thrombus in a\nstatesman's meningeal artery will throw an empire out of gear. I can\ntherefore not even hint at any solution of the pragmatic issue. I have\nonly wished to show you that that issue is what gives the real interest\nto all inquiries into what kinds of activity may be real. Are the forces\nthat really act in the world more foreseeing or more blind? As between\n'our' activities as 'we' experience them, and those of our ideas, or of\nour brain-cells, the issue is well-defined.\nI said a while back[100] that I should return to the 'metaphysical'\nquestion before ending; so, with a few words about that, I will now\nclose my remarks.\nIn whatever form we hear this question propounded, I think that it\nalways arises from two things, a belief that _causality_ must be exerted\nin activity, and a wonder as to how causality is made. If we take an\nactivity-situation at its face-value, it seems as if we caught _in\nflagrante delicto_ the very power that makes facts come and be. I now am\neagerly striving, for example, to get this truth which I seem half to\nperceive, into words which shall make it show more clearly. If the words\ncome, it will seem as if the striving itself had drawn or pulled them\ninto actuality out from the state of merely possible being in which they\nwere. How is this feat performed? How does the pulling _pull_? How do I\nget my hold on words not yet existent, and when they come by what means\nhave I _made_ them come? Really it is the problem of creation; for in\nthe end the question is: How do I make them _be_? Real activities are\nthose that really make things be, without which the things are not, and\nwith which they are there. Activity, so far as we merely feel it, on the\nother hand, is only an impression of ours, it may be maintained; and an\nimpression is, for all this way of thinking, only a shadow of another\nfact.\nArrived at this point, I can do little more than indicate the principles\non which, as it seems to me, a radically empirical philosophy is obliged\nto rely in handling such a dispute.\nIf there _be_ real creative activities in being, radical empiricism\nmust say, somewhere they must be immediately lived. Somewhere the\n_that_ of efficacious causing and the _what_ of it must be experienced\nin one, just as the what and the that of 'cold' are experienced in one\nwhenever a man has the sensation of cold here and now. It boots not to\nsay that our sensations are fallible. They are indeed; but to see the\nthermometer contradict us when we say 'it is cold' does not abolish\ncold as a specific nature from the universe. Cold is in the arctic\ncircle if not here. Even so, to feel that our train is moving when the\ntrain beside our window moves, to see the moon through a telescope\ncome twice as near, or to see two pictures as one solid when we look\nthrough a stereoscope at them, leaves motion, nearness, and solidity\nstill in being--if not here, yet each in its proper seat elsewhere.\nAnd wherever the seat of real causality _is_, as ultimately known 'for\ntrue' (in nerve-processes, if you will, that cause our feelings of\nactivity as well as the movements which these seem to prompt), a\nphilosophy of pure experience can consider the real causation as no\nother _nature_ of thing than that which even in our most erroneous\nexperiences appears to be at work. Exactly what appears there is what\nwe _mean_ by working, though we may later come to learn that working\nwas not exactly _there_. Sustaining, persevering, striving, paying\nwith effort as we go, hanging on, and finally achieving our\nintention--this _is_ action, this _is_ effectuation in the only shape\nin which, by a pure experience-philosophy, the whereabouts of it\nanywhere can be discussed. Here is creation in its first intention,\nhere is causality at work.[101] To treat this offhand as the bare\nillusory surface of a world whose real causality is an unimaginable\nontological principle hidden in the cubic deeps, is, for the more\nempirical way of thinking, only animism in another shape. You explain\nyour given fact by your 'principle,' but the principle itself, when\nyou look clearly at it, turns out to be nothing but a previous little\nspiritual copy of the fact. Away from that one and only kind of fact\nyour mind, considering causality, can never get.[102]\nI conclude, then, that real effectual causation as an ultimate nature,\nas a 'category,' if you like, of reality, is _just what we feel it to\nbe_, just that kind of conjunction which our own activity-series reveal.\nWe have the whole butt and being of it in our hands; and the healthy\nthing for philosophy is to leave off grubbing underground for what\neffects effectuation, or what makes action act, and to try to solve the\nconcrete questions of where effectuation in this world is located, of\nwhich things are the true causal agents there, and of what the more\nremote effects consist.\nFrom this point of view the greater sublimity traditionally attributed\nto the metaphysical inquiry, the grubbing inquiry, entirely disappears.\nIf we could know what causation really and transcendentally is in\nitself, the only _use_ of the knowledge would be to help us to recognize\nan actual cause when we had one, and so to track the future course of\noperations more intelligently out. The mere abstract inquiry into\ncausation's hidden nature is not more sublime than any other inquiry\nequally abstract. Causation inhabits no more sublime level than anything\nelse. It lives, apparently, in the dirt of the world as well as in the\nabsolute, or in man's unconquerable mind. The worth and interest of the\nworld consists not in its elements, be these elements things, or be\nthey the conjunctions of things; it exists rather in the dramatic\noutcome in the whole process, and in the meaning of the succession\nstages which the elements work out.\nMy colleague and master, Josiah Royce, in a page of his review of\nStout's _Analytic Psychology_[103] has some fine words on this point\nwith which I cordially agree. I cannot agree with his separating the\nnotion of efficacy from that of activity altogether (this I understand\nto be one contention of his) for activities are efficacious whenever\nthey are real activities at all. But the inner nature both of efficacy\nand of activity are superficial problems, I understand Royce to say; and\nthe only point for us in solving them would be their possible use in\nhelping us to solve the far deeper problem of the course and meaning of\nthe world of life. Life, says our colleague, is full of significance, of\nmeaning, of success and of defeat, of hoping and of striving, of\nlonging, of desire, and of inner value. It is a total presence that\nembodies worth. To live our own lives better in this presence is the\ntrue reason why we wish to know the elements of things; so even we\npsychologists must end on this pragmatic note.\nThe urgent problems of activity are thus more concrete. They are all\nproblems of the true relation of longer-span to shorter-span activities.\nWhen, for example, a number of 'ideas' (to use the name traditional in\npsychology) grow confluent in a larger field of consciousness, do the\nsmaller activities still co-exist with the wider activities then\nexperienced by the conscious subject? And, if so, do the wide activities\naccompany the narrow ones inertly, or do they exert control? Or do they\nperhaps utterly supplant and replace them and short-circuit their\neffects? Again, when a mental activity-process and a brain-cell series\nof activities both terminate in the same muscular movement, does the\nmental process steer the neural processes or not? Or, on the other hand,\ndoes it independently short-circuit their effects? Such are the\nquestions that we must begin with. But so far am I from suggesting any\ndefinitive answer to such questions, that I hardly yet can put them\nclearly. They lead, however, into that region of panpsychic and\nontologic speculation of which Professors Bergson and Strong have lately\nenlarged the literature in so able and interesting a way.[104] The\nresults of these authors seem in many respects dissimilar, and I\nunderstand than as yet but imperfectly; but I cannot help suspecting\nthat the direction of their work is very promising, and that they have\nthe hunter's instinct for the fruitful trails.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[85] President's Address before the American Psychological Association,\nPhiladelphia Meeting, December, 1904.

I could multiply\nsimilar quotations and would have introduced some of them into my text\nto make it more concrete, save that the mingling of different points of\nview in most of these author's discussions (not in M\u00fcnsterberg's) make\nit impossible to disentangle exactly what they mean. I am sure in any\ncase, to be accused of misrepresenting them totally, even in this note,\nby omission of the context, so the less I name names and the more I\nstick to abstract characterization of a merely possible style of\nopinion, the safer it will be. And apropos of misunderstandings, I may\nadd to this note a complaint on my own account. Professor Stout, in the\nexcellent chapter on 'Mental Activity,' in vol. I of his _Analytic\nPsychology_, takes me to task for identifying spiritual activity with\ncertain muscular feelings and gives quotations to bear him out. They are\nfrom certain paragraphs on 'the Self,' in which my attempt was to show\nwhat the central nucleus of the activities that we call 'ours' is.\n[_Principles of Psychology_, vol. I, pp. 299-305.] I found it in certain\nintracephalic movements which we habitually oppose, as 'subjective,' to\nthe activities of the transcorporeal world. I sought to show that there\nis no direct evidence that we feel the activity of an inner spiritual\nagent as such (I should now say the activity of 'consciousness' as such,\nsee [the first essay], 'Does Consciousness Exist?'). There are, in fact,\nthree distinguishable 'activities' in the field of discussion: the\nelementary activity involved in the mere _that_ of experience, in the\nfact that _something_ is going on, and the farther specification of this\n_something_ into two _whats_, an activity felt as 'ours,' and an\nactivity ascribed to objects. Stout, as I apprehend him, identifies\n'our' activity with that of the total experience-process, and when I\ncircumscribe it as a part thereof, accuses me of treating it as a sort\nof external appendage to itself (Stout: _op. cit._, vol. I, pp.\n162-163), as if I 'separated the activity from the process which is\nactive.' But all the processes in question are active, and their\nactivity is inseparable from their being. My book raised only the\nquestion of _which_ activity deserved the name of 'ours.' So far as we\nare 'persons,' and contrasted and opposed to an 'environment,' movements\nin our body figure as our activities; and I am unable to find any other\nactivities that are ours in this strictly personal sense. There is a\nwider sense in which the whole 'choir of heaven and furniture of the\nearth,' and their activities, are ours, for they are our 'objects.' But\n'we' are here only another name for the total process of experience,\nanother name for all that is, in fact; and I was dealing with the\npersonal and individualized self exclusively in the passages with which\nProfessor Stout finds fault.\nThe individualized self, which I believe to be the only thing properly\ncalled self, is a part of the content of the world experienced. The\nworld experienced (otherwise called the 'field of consciousness')\ncomes at all times with our body as its centre, centre of vision,\ncentre of action, centre of interest. Where the body is is 'here';\nwhen the body acts is 'now'; what the body touches is 'this'; all\nother things are 'there' and 'then' and 'that.' These words of\nemphasized position imply a systematization of things with reference\nto a focus of action and interest which lies in the body; and the\nsystematization is now so instinctive (was it ever not so?) that no\ndeveloped or active experience exists for us at all except in that\nordered form. So far as 'thoughts' and 'feelings' can be active, their\nactivity terminates in the activity of the body, and only through\nfirst arousing its activities can they begin to change those of the\nrest of the world. [Cf. also _A Pluralistic Universe_, p. 344, note 8.\nED.] The body is the storm centre, the origin of co-ordinates, the\nconstant place of stress in all that experience-train. Everything\ncircles round it, and is felt from its point of view. The word 'I,'\nthen, is primarily a noun of position, just like 'this' and 'here.'\nActivities attached to 'this' position have prerogative emphasis, and,\nif activities have feelings, must be felt in a peculiar way. The word\n'my' designates the kind of emphasis. I see no inconsistency whatever\nin defending, on the one hand, 'my' activities as unique and opposed\nto those of outer nature, and, on the other hand, in affirming, after\nintrospection, that they consist in movements in the head. The 'my' of\nthem is the emphasis, the feeling of perspective-interest in which\nthey are dyed.\n[99] [_Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_, sect. VII, part I,\nSelby-Bigge's edition, pp. 65 ff.]\n[100] Page 172.\n[101] Let me not be told that this contradicts [the first essay], 'Does\nConsciousness Exist?' (see especially page 32), in which it was said\nthat while 'thoughts' and 'things' have the same natures, the natures\nwork 'energetically' on each other in the things (fire burns, water\nwets, etc.) but not in the thoughts. Mental activity-trains are composed\nof thoughts, yet their members do work on each other, they check,\nsustain, and introduce. They do so when the activity is merely\nassociational as well as when effort is there. But, and this is my\nreply, they do so by other parts of their nature than those that\nenergize physically. One thought in every developed activity-series is a\ndesire or thought of purpose, and all the other thoughts acquire a\nfeeling tone from their relation of harmony or oppugnancy to this. The\ninterplay of these secondary tones (among which 'interest,'\n'difficulty,' and 'effort' figure) runs the drama in the mental series.\nIn what we term the physical drama these qualities play absolutely no\npart. The subject needs careful working out; but I can see no\ninconsistency.\n[102] I have found myself more than once accused in print of being the\nassertor of a metaphysical principle of activity. Since literary\nmisunderstandings retard the settlement of problems, I should like to\nsay that such an interpretation of the pages I have published on Effort\nand on Will is absolutely foreign to what I meant to express.\n[_Principles of Psychology_, vol. II, ch. XXVI.] I owe all my doctrines\non this subject to Renouvier; and Renouvier, as I understand him, is (or\nat any rate then was) an out and out phenomenist, a denier of 'forces'\nin the most strenuous sense. [Cf. Ch. Renouvier: _Esquisse d'une\nClassification Syst\u00e9matique des Doctrines Philosophiques_ (1885), vol.\nII, pp. 390-392; _Essais de Critique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale_ (1859), vol. II, \u00a7\u00a7 ix,\nxiii. For an acknowledgment of the author's general indebtedness to\nRenouvier, cf. _Some Problems of Philosophy_, p. 165, note. ED.] Single\nclauses in my writing, or sentences read out of their connection, may\npossibly have been compatible with a transphenomenal principle of\nenergy; but I defy anyone to show a single sentence which, taken with\nits context, should be naturally held to advocate that view. The\nmisinterpretation probably arose at first from my defending (after\nRenouvier) the indeterminism of our efforts. 'Free will' was supposed by\nmy critics to involve a supernatural agent. As a matter of plain history\nthe only 'free will' I have ever thought of defending is the character\nof novelty in fresh activity-situations. If an activity-process is the\nform of a whole 'field of consciousness,' and if each field of\nconsciousness is not only in its totality unique (as is now commonly\nadmitted) but has its elements unique (since in that situation they are\nall dyed in the total) then novelty is perpetually entering the world\nand what happens there is not pure _repetition_, as the dogma of the\nliteral uniformity of nature requires. Activity-situations come, in\nshort, each with an original touch. A 'principle' of free will if there\nwere one, would doubtless manifest itself in such phenomena, but I never\nsaw, nor do I now see, what the principle could do except rehearse the\nphenomenon beforehand, or why it ever should be invoked.\n[103] _Mind_, N. S., vol. VI, 1897; cf. pp. 392-393.\n[104] [Cf. _A Pluralistic Universe_, Lect. VI (on Bergson); H. Bergson:\n_Creative Evolution_, trans. by A. Mitchell; C. A. Strong: _Why the Mind\nhas a Body_, ch. XII. ED.]\nVII\nTHE ESSENCE OF HUMANISM[105]\nHumanism is a ferment that has 'come to stay.'[106] It is not a single\nhypothesis or theorem, and it dwells on no new facts. It is rather a\nslow shifting in the philosophic perspective, making things appear as\nfrom a new centre of interest or point of sight. Some writers are\nstrongly conscious of the shifting, others half unconscious, even though\ntheir own vision may have undergone much change. The result is no small\nconfusion in debate, the half-conscious humanists often taking part\nagainst the radical ones, as if they wished to count upon the other\nside.[107]\nIf humanism really be the name for such a shifting of perspective, it\nis obvious that the whole scene of the philosophic stage will change in\nsome degree if humanism prevails. The emphasis of things, their\nforeground and background distribution, their sizes and values, will not\nkeep just the same.[108] If such pervasive consequences be involved in\nhumanism, it is clear that no pains which philosophers may take, first\nin defining it, and then in furthering, checking, or steering its\nprogress, will be thrown away.\nIt suffers badly at present from incomplete definition. Its most\nsystematic advocates, Schiller and Dewey, have published fragmentary\nprograms only; and its bearing on many vital philosophic problems has\nnot been traced except by adversaries who, scenting heresies in advance,\nhave showered blows on doctrines--subjectivism and scepticism, for\nexample--that no good humanist finds it necessary to entertain. By their\nstill greater reticences, the anti-humanists have, in turn, perplexed\nthe humanists. Much of the controversy has involved the word 'truth.' It\nis always good in debate to know your adversary's point of view\nauthentically. But the critics of humanism never define exactly what the\nword 'truth' signifies when they use it themselves. The humanists have\nto guess at their view; and the result has doubtless been much beating\nof the air. Add to all this, great individual differences in both camps,\nand it becomes clear that nothing is so urgently needed, at the stage\nwhich things have reached at present, as a sharper definition by each\nside of its central point of view.\nWhoever will contribute any touch of sharpness will help us to make sure\nof what's what and who is who. Anyone can contribute such a definition,\nand, without it, no one knows exactly where he stands. If I offer my own\nprovisional definition of humanism[109] now and here, others may improve\nit, some adversary may be led to define his own creed more sharply by\nthe contrast, and a certain quickening of the crystallization of general\nopinion may result.\nI\nThe essential service of humanism, as I conceive the situation, is to\nhave seen that _though one part of our experience may lean upon another\npart to make it what it is in any one of several aspects in which it may\nbe considered, experience as a whole is self-containing and leans on\nnothing_.\nSince this formula also expresses the main contention of transcendental\nidealism, it needs abundant explication to make it unambiguous. It\nseems, at first sight, to confine itself to denying theism and\npantheism. But, in fact, it need not deny either; everything would\ndepend on the exegesis; and if the formula ever became canonical, it\nwould certainly develop both right-wing and left-wing interpreters. I\nmyself read humanism theistically and pluralistically. If there be a\nGod, he is no absolute all-experiencer, but simply the experiencer of\nwidest actual conscious span. Read thus, humanism is for me a religion\nsusceptible of reasoned defence, though I am well aware how many minds\nthere are to whom it can appeal religiously only when it has been\nmonistically translated. Ethically the pluralistic form of it takes for\nme a stronger hold on reality than any other philosophy I know of--it\nbeing essentially a _social_ philosophy, a philosophy of '_co_,' in\nwhich conjunctions do the work. But my primary reason for advocating it\nis its matchless intellectual economy. It gets rid, not only of the\nstanding 'problems' that monism engenders ('problem of evil,' 'problem\nof freedom,' and the like), but of other metaphysical mysteries and\nparadoxes as well.\nIt gets rid, for example, of the whole agnostic controversy, by refusing\nto entertain the hypothesis of trans-empirical reality at all. It gets\nrid of any need for an absolute of the Bradleyan type (avowedly sterile\nfor intellectual purposes) by insisting that the conjunctive relations\nfound within experience are faultlessly real. It gets rid of the need of\nan absolute of the Roycean type (similarly sterile) by its pragmatic\ntreatment of the problem of knowledge [a treatment of which I have\nalready given a version in two very inadequate articles].[110] As the\nviews of knowledge, reality and truth imputed to humanism have been\nthose so far most fiercely attacked, it is in regard to these ideas that\na sharpening of focus seems most urgently required. I proceed therefore\nto bring the views which _I_ impute to humanism in these respects into\nfocus as briefly as I can.\nII\nIf the central humanistic thesis, printed above in italics, be accepted,\nit will follow that, if there be any such thing at all as knowing, the\nknower and the object known must both be portions of experience. One\npart of experience must, therefore, either\n(1) Know another part of experience--in other words, parts must, as\nProfessor Woodbridge says,[111] represent _one another_ instead of\nrepresenting realities outside of 'consciousness'--this case is that of\nconceptual knowledge; or else\n(2) They must simply exist as so many ultimate _thats_ or facts of\nbeing, in the first instance; and then, as a secondary complication, and\nwithout doubling up its entitative single-ness, any one and the same\n_that_ must figure alternately as a thing known and as a knowledge of\nthe thing, by reason of two divergent kinds of context into which, in\nthe general course of experience, it gets woven.[112]\nThis second case is that of sense-perception. There is a stage of\nthought that goes beyond common sense, and of it I shall say more\npresently; but the common-sense stage is a perfectly definite\nhalting-place of thought, primarily for purposes of action; and, so long\nas we remain on the common-sense stage of thought, object and subject\n_fuse_ in the fact of 'presentation' or sense-perception--the pen and\nhand which I now _see_ writing, for example, _are_ the physical\nrealities which those words designate. In this case there is no\nself-transcendency implied in the knowing. Humanism, here, is only a\nmore comminuted _Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_.[113]\nIn case (1), on the contrary, the representative experience does\ntranscend itself in knowing the other experience that is its object. No\none can talk of the knowledge of the one by the other without seeing\nthem as numerically distinct entities, of which the one lies beyond the\nother and away from it, along some direction and with some interval,\nthat can be definitely named. But, if the talker be a humanist, he must\nalso see this distance-interval concretely and pragmatically, and\nconfess it to consist of other intervening experiences--of possible\nones, at all events, if not of actual. To call my present idea of my\ndog, for example, cognitive of the real dog means that, as the actual\ntissue of experience is constituted, the idea is capable of leading into\na chain of other experiences on my part that go from next to next and\nterminate at last in vivid sense-perceptions of a jumping, barking,\nhairy body. Those _are_ the real dog, the dog's full presence, for my\ncommon sense. If the supposed talker is a profound philosopher, although\nthey may not _be_ the real dog for him, they _mean_ the real dog, are\npractical substitutes for the real dog, as the representation was a\npractical substitute for them, that real dog being a lot of atoms, say,\nor of mind-stuff, that lie _where_ the sense-perceptions lie in his\nexperience as well as in my own.\nIII\nThe philosopher here stands for the stage of thought that goes beyond\nthe stage of common sense; and the difference is simply that he\n'interpolates' and 'extrapolates,' where common sense does not. For\ncommon sense, two men see the same identical real dog. Philosophy,\nnoting actual differences in their perceptions, points out the duality\nof these latter, and interpolates something between them as a more real\nterminus--first, organs, viscera, etc.; next, cells; then, ultimate\natoms; lastly, mind-stuff perhaps. The original sense-termini of the two\nmen, instead of coalescing with each other and with the real dog-object,\nas at first supposed, are thus held by philosophers to be separated by\ninvisible realities with which, at most, they are conterminous.\nAbolish, now, one of the percipients, and the interpolation changes into\n'extrapolation.' The sense-terminus of the remaining percipient is\nregarded by the philosopher as not quite reaching reality. He has only\ncarried the procession of experiences, the philosopher thinks, to a\ndefinite, because practical, halting-place somewhere on the way towards\nan absolute truth that lies beyond.\nThe humanist sees all the time, however, that there is no absolute\ntranscendency even about the more absolute realities thus conjectured or\nbelieved in. The viscera and cells are only possible percepts following\nupon that of the outer body. The atoms again, though we may never attain\nto human means of perceiving them, are still defined perceptually. The\nmind-stuff itself is conceived as a kind of experience; and it is\npossible to frame the hypothesis (such hypotheses can by no logic be\nexcluded from philosophy) of two knowers of a piece of mind-stuff and\nthe mind-stuff itself becoming 'confluent' at the moment at which our\nimperfect knowing might pass into knowing of a completed type. Even so\ndo you and I habitually represent our two perceptions and the real dog\nas confluent, though only provisionally, and for the common-sense stage\nof thought. If my pen be inwardly made of mind-stuff, there is no\nconfluence _now_ between that mind-stuff and my visual perception of\nthe pen. But conceivably there might come to be such confluence; for, in\nthe case of my hand, the visual sensations and the inward feelings of\nthe hand, its mind-stuff, so to speak, are even now as confluent as any\ntwo things can be.\nThere is, thus, no breach in humanistic epistemology. Whether knowledge\nbe taken as ideally perfected, or only as true enough to pass muster for\npractice, it is hung on one continuous scheme. Reality, howsoever\nremote, is always defined as a terminus within the general possibilities\nof experience; and what knows it is defined as an experience _that\n'represents' it, in the sense of being substitutable for it in our\nthinking_ because it leads to the same associates, _or in the sense of\n'pointing to it'_ through a chain of other experiences that either\nintervene or may intervene.\nAbsolute reality here bears the same relation to sensation as sensation\nbears to conception or imagination. Both are provisional or final\ntermini, sensation being only the terminus at which the practical man\nhabitually stops, while the philosopher projects a 'beyond' in the\nshape of more absolute reality. These termini, for the practical and the\nphilosophical stages of thought respectively, are self-supporting. They\nare not 'true' of anything else, they simply _are_, are _real_. They\n'lean on nothing,' as my italicized formula said. Rather does the whole\nfabric of experience lean on them, just as the whole fabric of the solar\nsystem, including many relative positions, leans, for its absolute\nposition in space, on any one of its constituent stars. Here, again, one\ngets a new _Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_ in pluralistic form.[114]\nIV\nIf I have succeeded in making this at all clear (though I fear that\nbrevity and abstractness between them may have made me fail), the reader\nwill see that the 'truth' of our mental operations must always be an\nintra-experiential affair. A conception is reckoned true by common sense\nwhen it can be made to lead to a sensation. The sensation, which for\ncommon sense is not so much 'true' as 'real,' is held to be\n_provisionally_ true by the philosopher just in so far as it _covers_\n(abuts at, or occupies the place of) a still more absolutely real\nexperience, in the possibility of which to some remoter experient the\nphilosopher finds reason to believe.\nMeanwhile what actually _does_ count for true to any individual trower,\nwhether he be philosopher or common man, is always a result of his\n_apperceptions_. If a novel experience, conceptual or sensible,\ncontradict too emphatically our pre-existent system of beliefs, in\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred it is treated as false. Only when the\nolder and the newer experiences are congruous enough to mutually\napperceive and modify each other, does what we treat as an advance in\ntruth result. [Having written of this point in an article in reply to\nMr. Joseph's criticism of my humanism, I will say no more about truth\nhere, but refer the reader to that review.[115]] In no case, however,\nneed truth consist in a relation between our experiences and something\narchetypal or trans-experiential. Should we ever reach absolutely\nterminal experiences, experiences in which we all agreed, which were\nsuperseded by no revised continuations, these would not be _true_, they\nwould be _real_, they would simply _be_, and be indeed the angles,\ncorners, and linchpins of all reality, on which the truth of everything\nelse would be stayed. Only such _other_ things as led to these by\nsatisfactory conjunctions would be 'true.' Satisfactory connection of\nsome sort with such termini is all that the word 'truth' means. On the\ncommon-sense stage of thought sense-presentations serve as such termini.\nOur ideas and concepts and scientific theories pass for true only so far\nas they harmoniously lead back to the world of sense.\nI hope that many humanists will endorse this attempt of mine to trace\nthe more essential features of that way of viewing things. I feel almost\ncertain that Messrs. Dewey and Schiller will do so. If the attackers\nwill also take some slight account of it, it may be that discussion will\nbe a little less wide of the mark than it has hitherto been.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[105] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Les faits mat\u00e9riels, pris dans leur mat\u00e9rialit\u00e9, ne sont pas\n_\u00e9prouv\u00e9s_, ne sont pas objets _d'exp\u00e9rience_, ne se _rapportent_ pas.\nPour qu'ils prennent la forme du syst\u00e8me dans lequel nous nous sentons\nvivre, il faut qu'ils _apparaissent_, et ce fait d'appara\u00eetre, surajout\u00e9\n\u00e0 leur existence brute, s'appelle la conscience que nous en avons, ou\npeut-\u00eatre, selon l'hypoth\u00e8se panpsychiste, qu'ils ont d'eux-m\u00eames.\nVoil\u00e0 ce dualisme inv\u00e9t\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il semble impossible de chasser de notre\nvue du monde. Ce monde peut bien exister en soi, mais nous n'en savons\nrien, car pour nous il est exclusivement un objet d'exp\u00e9rience; et la\ncondition indispensable \u00e0 cet effet, c'est qu'il soit rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 des\nt\u00e9moins, qu'il soit connu par un sujet ou par des sujets spirituels.\nObjet et sujet, voil\u00e0 les deux jambes sans lesquelles il semble que la\nphilosophie ne saurait faire un pas en avant.\nToutes les \u00e9coles sont d'accord l\u00e0-dessus, scolastique, cart\u00e9sianisme,\nkantisme, n\u00e9o-kantisme, tous admettent le dualisme fondamental. Le\npositivisme ou agnosticisme de nos jours, qui se pique de relever des\nsciences naturelles, se donne volontiers, il est vrai, le nom de\nmonisme. Mais ce n'est qu'un monisme verbal. Il pose une r\u00e9alit\u00e9\ninconnue, mais nous dit que cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sente toujours sous deux\n\"aspects,\" un c\u00f4t\u00e9 conscience et un c\u00f4t\u00e9 mati\u00e8re, et ces deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s\ndemeurent aussi irr\u00e9ductibles que les attributs fondamentaux, \u00e9tendue et\npens\u00e9e, du Dieu de Spinoza. Au fond, le monisme contemporain est du\nspinozisme pur.\nOr, comment se repr\u00e9sente-t-on cette conscience dont nous sommes tous si\nport\u00e9s \u00e0 admettre l'existence? Impossible de la d\u00e9finir, nous dit-on,\nmais nous en avons tous une intuition imm\u00e9diate: tout d'abord la\nconscience a conscience d'elle-m\u00eame. Demandez \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne que\nvous rencontrerez, homme ou femme, psychologue ou ignorant, et elle vous\nr\u00e9pondra qu'elle _se sent_ penser, jouir, souffrir, vouloir, tout comme\nelle se sent respirer. Elle per\u00e7oit directement sa vie spirituelle comme\nune esp\u00e8ce de courant int\u00e9rieur, actif, l\u00e9ger, fluide, d\u00e9licat, diaphane\npour ainsi dire, et absolument oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 quoi que ce soit de mat\u00e9riel.\nBref, la vie subjective ne para\u00eet pas seulement \u00eatre une condition\nlogiquement indispensable pour qu'il y ait un monde objectif qui\n_apparaisse_, c'est encore un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'exp\u00e9rience m\u00eame que nous\n\u00e9prouvons directement, au m\u00eame titre que nous \u00e9prouvons notre propre\ncorps.\nId\u00e9es et Choses, comment donc ne pas reconna\u00eetre leur dualisme?\nSentiments et Objets, comment douter de leur h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 absolue?\nLa psychologie soi-disant scientifique admet cette h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 comme\nl'ancienne psychologie spiritualiste l'admettait. Comment ne pas\nl'admettre? Chaque science d\u00e9coupe arbitrairement dans la trame des\nfaits un champ o\u00f9 elle se parque, et dont elle d\u00e9crit et \u00e9tudie le\ncontenu. La psychologie prend justement pour son domaine le champ des\nfaits de conscience. Elle les postule sans les critiquer, elle les\noppose aux faits mat\u00e9riels; et sans critiquer non plus la notion de ces\nderniers, elle les rattache \u00e0 la conscience par le lien myst\u00e9rieux de la\n_connaissance_, de, l'_aperception_ qui, pour elle, est un troisi\u00e8me\ngenre de fait fondamental et ultime. En suivant cette voie, la\npsychologie contemporaine a f\u00eat\u00e9 de grands triomphes. Elle a pu faire\nune esquisse de l'\u00e9volution de la vie consciente, en concevant cette\nderni\u00e8re comme s'adaptant de plus en plus compl\u00e8tement au milieu\nphysique environnant. Elle a pu \u00e9tablir un parall\u00e9lisme dans le\ndualisme, celui des faits psychiques et des \u00e9v\u00e9nements c\u00e9r\u00e9braux. Elle a\nexpliqu\u00e9 les illusions, les hallucinations, et jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point,\nles maladies mentales. Ce sont de beaux progr\u00e8s; mais il reste encore\nbien des probl\u00e8mes. La philosophie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale surtout, qui a pour devoir\nde scruter tous les postulats, trouve des paradoxes et des emp\u00eachements\nl\u00e0 o\u00f9 la science passe outre; et il n'y a que les amateurs de science\npopulaire qui ne sont jamais perplexes. Plus on va au fond des choses,\nplus on trouve d'\u00e9nigmes; et j'avoue pour ma part que depuis que je\nm'occupe s\u00e9rieusement de psychologie, ce vieux dualisme de mati\u00e8re et de\npens\u00e9e, cette h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 pos\u00e9e comme absolue des deux essences, m'a\ntoujours pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s. C'est de quelques-unes de ces\ndifficult\u00e9s que je voudrais maintenant vous entretenir.\nD'abord il y en a une, laquelle, j'en suis convaincu, vous aura frapp\u00e9s\ntous. Prenons la perception ext\u00e9rieure, la sensation directe que nous\ndonnent par exemple les murs de cette salle. Peut-on dire ici que le\npsychique et le physique sont absolument h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes? Au contraire, ils\nsont si peu h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes que si nous nous pla\u00e7ons au point de vue du sens\ncommun; si nous faisons abstraction de toutes les inventions\nexplicatives, des mol\u00e9cules et des ondulations \u00e9th\u00e9r\u00e9es, par exemple,\nqui au fond sont des entit\u00e9s m\u00e9taphysiques; si, en un mot, nous prenons\nla r\u00e9alit\u00e9 na\u00efvement et telle qu'elle nous est donn\u00e9e tout d'abord,\ncette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sensible d'o\u00f9 d\u00e9pendent nos int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux, et sur\nlaquelle se portent toutes nos actions; eh bien, cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sensible\net la sensation que nous en avons sont, au moment o\u00f9 la sensation se\nproduit, absolument identiques l'une \u00e0 l'autre. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est\nl'aperception m\u00eame. Les mots \"murs de cette salle\" ne signifient que\ncette blancheur fra\u00eeche et sonore qui nous entoure, coup\u00e9e par ces\nfen\u00eatres, born\u00e9e par ces lignes et ces angles. Le physique ici n'a pas\nd'autre contenu que le psychique. Le sujet et l'objet se confondent.\nC'est Berkeley qui le premier a mis cette v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en honneur. _Esse est\npercipi._ Nos sensations ne sont pas de petits duplicats int\u00e9rieurs des\nchoses, elles sont les choses m\u00eames en tant que les choses nous sont\npr\u00e9sentes. Et quoi que l'on veuille penser de la vie absente, cach\u00e9e, et\npour ainsi dire priv\u00e9e, des choses, et quelles que soient les\nconstructions hypoth\u00e9tiques qu'on en fasse, il reste vrai que la vie\npublique des choses, cette actualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente par laquelle elles nous\nconfrontent, d'o\u00f9 d\u00e9rivent toutes nos constructions th\u00e9oriques, et \u00e0\nlaquelle elles doivent toutes revenir et se rattacher sous peine de\nflotter dans l'air et dans l'irr\u00e9el; cette actualit\u00e9, dis-je, est\nhomog\u00e8ne, et non pas seulement homog\u00e8ne, mais num\u00e9riquement une, avec\nune certaine partie de notre vie int\u00e9rieure.\nVoil\u00e0 pour la perception ext\u00e9rieure. Quand on s'adresse \u00e0 l'imagination,\n\u00e0 la m\u00e9moire ou aux facult\u00e9s de repr\u00e9sentation abstraite, bien que les\nfaits soient ici beaucoup plus compliqu\u00e9s, je crois que la m\u00eame\nhomog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 essentielle se d\u00e9gage. Pour simplifier le probl\u00e8me, excluons\nd'abord toute r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sensible. Prenons la pens\u00e9e pure, telle qu'elle\ns'effectue dans le r\u00eave ou la r\u00eaverie, ou dans la m\u00e9moire du pass\u00e9. Ici\nencore, l'\u00e9toffe de l'exp\u00e9rience ne fait-elle pas double emploi, le\nphysique et le psychique ne se confondent-ils pas? Si je r\u00eave d'une\nmontagne d'or, elle n'existe sans doute pas en dehors du r\u00eave, mais\n_dans_ le r\u00eave elle est de nature ou d'essence parfaitement physique,\nc'est _comme_ physique qu'elle m'appara\u00eet. Si en ce moment je me permets\nde me souvenir de ma maison en Am\u00e9rique, et des d\u00e9tails de mon\nembarquement r\u00e9cent pour l'Italie, le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne pur, le fait qui se\nproduit, qu'est-il? C'est, dit-on, ma pens\u00e9e, avec son contenu. Mais\nencore ce contenu, qu'est-il? Il porte la forme d'une partie du monde\nr\u00e9el, partie distante, il est vrai, de six mille kilom\u00e8tres d'espace et\nde six semaines de temps, mais reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la salle o\u00f9 nous sommes par une\nfoule de choses, objets et \u00e9v\u00e9nements, homog\u00e8nes d'une part avec la\nsalle et d'autre part avec l'objet de mes souvenirs.\nCe contenu ne se donne pas comme \u00e9tant d'abord un tout petit fait\nint\u00e9rieur que je projetterais ensuite au loin, il se pr\u00e9sente d'embl\u00e9e\ncomme le fait \u00e9loign\u00e9 m\u00eame. Et l'acte de penser ce contenu, la\nconscience que j'en ai, que sont-ils? Sont-ce au fond autre chose que\ndes mani\u00e8res r\u00e9trospectives de nommer le contenu lui-m\u00eame, lorsqu'on\nl'aura s\u00e9par\u00e9 de tous ces interm\u00e9diaires physiques, et reli\u00e9 \u00e0 un\nnouveau groupe d'associ\u00e9s qui le font rentrer dans ma vie mentale, les\n\u00e9motions par exemple qu'il a \u00e9veill\u00e9es en moi, l'attention que j'y\nporte, mes id\u00e9es de tout \u00e0 l'heure qui l'ont suscit\u00e9 comme souvenir? Ce\nn'est qu'en se rapportant \u00e0 ces derniers associ\u00e9s que le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\narrive \u00e0 \u00eatre class\u00e9 comme _pens\u00e9e_; tant qu'il ne se rapporte qu'aux\npremiers il demeure ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne _objectif_.\nIl est vrai que nous opposons habituellement nos images int\u00e9rieures aux\nobjets, et que nous les consid\u00e9rons comme de petites copies, comme des\ncalques ou doubles, affaiblis, de ces derniers. C'est qu'un objet\npr\u00e9sent a une vivacit\u00e9 et une nettet\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles de l'image.\nIl lui fait ainsi contraste; et pour me servir de l'excellent mot de\nTaine, il lui sert de _r\u00e9ducteur_. Quand les deux sont pr\u00e9sents\nensemble, l'objet prend le premier plan et l'image \"recule,\" devient une\nchose \"absente.\" Mais cet objet pr\u00e9sent, qu'est-il en lui-m\u00eame? De\nquelle \u00e9toffe est-il fait? De la m\u00eame \u00e9toffe que l'image. Il est fait de\n_sensations_; il est chose per\u00e7ue. Son _esse_ est _percipi_, et lui et\nl'image sont g\u00e9n\u00e9riquement homog\u00e8nes.\nSi je pense en ce moment \u00e0 mon chapeau que j'ai laiss\u00e9 tout \u00e0 l'heure au\nvestiaire, o\u00f9 est le dualisme, le discontinu, entre le chapeau pens\u00e9 et\nle chapeau r\u00e9el? C'est d'un vrai _chapeau absent_ que mon esprit\ns'occupe. J'en tiens compte pratiquement comme d'une r\u00e9alit\u00e9. S'il \u00e9tait\npr\u00e9sent sur cette table, le chapeau d\u00e9terminerait un mouvement de ma\nmain: je l'enl\u00e8verais. De m\u00eame ce chapeau con\u00e7u, ce chapeau en id\u00e9e,\nd\u00e9terminera tant\u00f4t la direction de mes pas. J'irai le prendre. L'id\u00e9e\nque j'en ai se continuera jusqu'\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence sensible du chapeau, et\ns'y fondra harmonieusement.\nJe conclus donc que,--bien qu'il y ait un dualisme pratique--puisque les\nimages se distinguent des objets, en tiennent lieu, et nous y m\u00e8nent, il\nn'y a pas lieu de leur attribuer une diff\u00e9rence de nature essentielle.\nPens\u00e9e et actualit\u00e9 sont faites d'une seule et m\u00eame \u00e9toffe, qui est\nl'\u00e9toffe de l'exp\u00e9rience en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nLa psychologie de la perception ext\u00e9rieure nous m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la m\u00eame\nconclusion. Quand j'aper\u00e7ois l'objet devant moi comme une table de telle\nforme, \u00e0 telle distance, on m'explique que ce fait est d\u00fb \u00e0 deux\nfacteurs, \u00e0 une mati\u00e8re de sensation qui me p\u00e9n\u00e8tre par la voie des yeux\net qui donne l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment d'ext\u00e9riorit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, et \u00e0 des id\u00e9es qui se\nr\u00e9veillent, vont \u00e0 la rencontre de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la classent et\nl'interpr\u00e8tent. Mais qui peut faire la part, dans la table concr\u00e8tement\naper\u00e7ue, de ce qui est sensation et de ce qui est id\u00e9e? L'externe et\nl'interne, l'\u00e9tendu et l'in\u00e9tendu, se fusionnent et font un mariage\nindissoluble. Cela rappelle ces panoramas circulaires, o\u00f9 des objets\nr\u00e9els, rochers, herbe, chariots bris\u00e9s, etc., qui occupent l'avant-plan,\nsont si ing\u00e9nieusement reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la toile qui fait le fond, et qui\nrepr\u00e9sente une bataille ou un vaste paysage, que l'on ne sait plus\ndistinguer ce qui est objet de ce qui est peinture. Les coutures et les\njoints sont imperceptibles.\nCela pourrait-il advenir si l'objet et l'id\u00e9e \u00e9taient absolument\ndissemblables de nature?\n*       *       *       *       *\nJe suis convaincu que des consid\u00e9rations pareilles \u00e0 celles que je viens\nd'exprimer auront d\u00e9j\u00e0 suscit\u00e9, chez vous aussi, des doutes au sujet du\ndualisme pr\u00e9tendu.\nEt d'autres raisons de douter surgissent encore. Il y a toute une sph\u00e8re\nd'adjectifs et d'attributs qui ne sont ni objectifs, ni subjectifs d'une\nmani\u00e8re exclusive, mais que nous employons tant\u00f4t d'une mani\u00e8re et\ntant\u00f4t d'une autre, comme si nous nous complaisions dans leur ambigu\u00eft\u00e9.\nJe parle des qualit\u00e9s que nous _appr\u00e9cions_, pour ainsi dire, dans les\nchoses, leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 esth\u00e9tique, moral, leur valeur pour nous. La beaut\u00e9,\npar exemple, o\u00f9 r\u00e9side-t-elle? Est-elle dans la statue, dans la sonate,\nou dans notre esprit? Mon coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 Harvard, George Santayana, a \u00e9crit\nun livre d'esth\u00e9tique,[117] o\u00f9 il appelle la beaut\u00e9 \"le plaisir\nobjectifi\u00e9\"; et en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, c'est bien ici qu'on pourrait parler de\nprojection au dehors. On dit indiff\u00e9remment une chaleur agr\u00e9able, ou une\nsensation agr\u00e9able de chaleur. La raret\u00e9, le pr\u00e9cieux du diamant nous en\nparaissent des qualit\u00e9s essentielles. Nous parlons d'un orage affreux,\nd'un homme ha\u00efssable, d'une action indigne, et nous croyons parler\nobjectivement, bien que ces termes n'expriment que des rapports \u00e0 notre\nsensibilit\u00e9 \u00e9motive propre. Nous disons m\u00eame un chemin p\u00e9nible, un ciel\ntriste, un coucher de soleil superbe. Toute cette mani\u00e8re animiste de\nregarder les choses qui para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on primitive de penser\ndes hommes, peut tr\u00e8s bien s'expliquer (et M. Santayana, dans un autre\nlivre tout r\u00e9cent,[118] l'a bien expliqu\u00e9e ainsi) par l'habitude\nd'attribuer \u00e0 l'objet _tout_ ce que nous ressentons en sa pr\u00e9sence. Le\npartage du subjectif et de l'objectif est le fait d'une r\u00e9flexion tr\u00e8s\navanc\u00e9e, que nous aimons encore ajourner dans beaucoup d'endroits. Quand\nles besoins pratiques ne nous en tirent pas forc\u00e9ment, il semble que\nnous aimons \u00e0 nous bercer dans le vague.\nLes qualit\u00e9s secondes elles-m\u00eames, chaleur, son, lumi\u00e8re, n'ont encore\naujourd'hui qu'une attribution vague. Pour le sens commun, pour la vie\npratique, elles sont absolument objectives, physiques. Pour le\nphysicien, elles sont subjectives. Pour lui, il n'y a que la forme, la\nmasse, le mouvement, qui aient une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure. Pour le\nphilosophe id\u00e9aliste, au contraire, forme et mouvement sont tout aussi\nsubjectifs que lumi\u00e8re et chaleur, et il n'y a que la chose-en-soi\ninconnue, le \"noum\u00e8ne,\" qui jouisse d'une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 extramentale compl\u00e8te.\nNos sensations intimes conservent encore de cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Il y a des\nillusions de mouvement qui prouvent que nos premi\u00e8res sensations de\nmouvement \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es. C'est le monde entier, avec nous, qui se\nmouvait. Maintenant nous distinguons notre propre mouvement de celui des\nobjets qui nous entourent, et parmi les objets nous en distinguons qui\ndemeurent en repos. Mais il est des \u00e9tats de vertige o\u00f9 nous retombons\nencore aujourd'hui dans l'indiff\u00e9renciation premi\u00e8re.\nVous connaissez tous sans doute cette th\u00e9orie qui a voulu faire des\n\u00e9motions des sommes de sensations visc\u00e9rales et musculaires. Elle a\ndonn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 bien des controverses, et aucune opinion n'a encore conquis\nl'unanimit\u00e9 des suffrages. Vous connaissez aussi les controverses sur la\nnature de l'activit\u00e9 mentale. Les uns soutiennent qu'elle est une force\npurement spirituelle que nous sommes en \u00e9tat d'apercevoir imm\u00e9diatement\ncomme telle. Les autres pr\u00e9tendent que ce que nous nommons activit\u00e9\nmentale (effort, attention, par exemple) n'est que le reflet senti de\ncertains effets dont notre organisme est le si\u00e8ge, tensions musculaires\nau cr\u00e2ne et au gosier, arr\u00eat ou passage de la respiration, afflux de\nsang, etc.\nDe quelque mani\u00e8re que se r\u00e9solvent ces controverses, leur existence\nprouve bien clairement une chose, c'est qu'il est tr\u00e8s difficile, ou\nm\u00eame absolument impossible de savoir, par la seule inspection intime de\ncertains ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, s'ils sont de nature physique, occupant de\nl'\u00e9tendue, etc., ou s'ils sont de nature purement psychique et\nint\u00e9rieure. Il nous faut toujours trouver des raisons pour appuyer notre\navis; il nous faut chercher la classification la plus probable du\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne; et en fin de compte il pourrait bien se trouver que toutes\nnos classifications usuelles eussent eu leurs motifs plut\u00f4t dans les\nbesoins de la pratique que dans quelque facult\u00e9 que nous aurions\nd'apercevoir deux essences ultimes et diverses qui composeraient\nensemble la trame des choses. Le corps de chacun de nous offre un\ncontraste pratique presque violent \u00e0 tout le reste du milieu ambiant.\nTout ce qui arrive au dedans de ce corps nous est plus intime et\nimportant que ce qui arrive ailleurs. Il s'identifie avec notre moi, il\nse classe avec lui. Ame, vie, souffle, qui saurait bien les distinguer\nexactement? M\u00eame nos images et nos souvenirs, qui n'agissent sur le\nmonde physique que par le moyen de notre corps, semblent appartenir \u00e0 ce\ndernier. Nous les traitons comme internes, nous les classons avec nos\nsentiments affectifs. Il faut bien avouer, en somme, que la question du\ndualisme de la pens\u00e9e et de la mati\u00e8re est bien loin d'\u00eatre finalement\nr\u00e9solue.\nEt voil\u00e0 termin\u00e9e la premi\u00e8re partie de mon discours. J'ai voulu vous\np\u00e9n\u00e9trer, Mesdames et Messieurs, de mes doutes et de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, aussi\nbien que de l'importance, du probl\u00e8me.\nQuant \u00e0 moi, apr\u00e8s de longues ann\u00e9es d'h\u00e9sitation, j'ai fini par prendre\nmon parti carr\u00e9ment. Je crois que la conscience, telle qu'on se la\nrepr\u00e9sente commun\u00e9ment, soit comme entit\u00e9, soit comme activit\u00e9 pure,\nmais en tout cas comme fluide, in\u00e9tendue, diaphane, vide de tout contenu\npropre, mais se connaissant directement elle-m\u00eame, spirituelle enfin, je\ncrois, dis-je, que cette conscience est une pure chim\u00e8re, et que la\nsomme de r\u00e9alit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes que le mot conscience devrait couvrir,\nm\u00e9rite une toute autre description, description, du reste, qu'une\nphilosophie attentive aux faits et sachant faire un peu d'analyse,\nserait d\u00e9sormais en \u00e9tat de fournir ou plut\u00f4t de commencer \u00e0 fournir. Et\nces mots m'am\u00e8nent \u00e0 la seconde partie de mon discours. Elle sera\nbeaucoup plus courte que la premi\u00e8re, parce que si je la d\u00e9veloppais sur\nla m\u00eame \u00e9chelle, elle serait beaucoup trop longue. Il faut, par\ncons\u00e9quent, que je me restreigne aux seules indications indispensables.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAdmettons que la conscience, la _Bewusstheit_, con\u00e7ue comme essence,\nentit\u00e9, activit\u00e9, moiti\u00e9 irr\u00e9ductible de chaque exp\u00e9rience, soit\nsupprim\u00e9e, que le dualisme fondamental et pour ainsi dire ontologique\nsoit aboli et que ce que nous supposions exister soit seulement ce qu'on\na appel\u00e9 jusqu'ici le _contenu_, le _Inhalt_, de la conscience; comment\nla philosophie va-t-elle se tirer d'affaire avec l'esp\u00e8ce de monisme\nvague qui en r\u00e9sultera? Je vais t\u00e2cher de vous insinuer quelques\nsuggestions positives l\u00e0-dessus, bien que je craigne que, faute du\nd\u00e9veloppement n\u00e9cessaire, mes id\u00e9es ne r\u00e9pandront pas une clart\u00e9 tr\u00e8s\ngrande. Pourvu que j'indique un commencement de sentier, ce sera\npeut-\u00eatre assez.\nAu fond, pourquoi nous accrochons-nous d'une mani\u00e8re si tenace \u00e0 cette\nid\u00e9e d'une conscience surajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l'existence du contenu des choses?\nPourquoi la r\u00e9clamons-nous si fortement, que celui qui la nierait nous\nsemblerait plut\u00f4t un mauvais plaisant qu'un penseur? N'est-ce pas pour\nsauver ce fait ind\u00e9niable que le contenu de l'exp\u00e9rience n'a pas\nseulement une existence propre et comme immanente et intrins\u00e8que, mais\nque chaque partie de ce contenu d\u00e9teint pour ainsi dire sur ses\nvoisines, rend compte d'elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 d'autres, sort en quelque sorte de\nsoi pour \u00eatre sue et qu'ainsi tout le champ de l'exp\u00e9rience se trouve\n\u00eatre transparent de part en part, ou constitu\u00e9 comme un espace qui\nserait rempli de miroirs?\nCette bilat\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des parties de l'exp\u00e9rience,--\u00e0 savoir d'une part,\nqu'elles _sont_ avec des qualit\u00e9s propres; d'autre part, qu'elles sont\nrapport\u00e9es \u00e0 d'autres parties et _sues_--l'opinion r\u00e9gnante la constate\net l'explique par un dualisme fondamental de constitution appartenant \u00e0\nchaque morceau d'exp\u00e9rience en propre. Dans cette feuille de papier il\nn'y a pas seulement, dit-on, le contenu, blancheur, minceur, etc., mais\nil y a ce second fait de la conscience de cette blancheur et de cette\nminceur. Cette fonction d'\u00eatre \"rapport\u00e9,\" de faire partie de la trame\nenti\u00e8re d'une exp\u00e9rience plus compr\u00e9hensive, on l'\u00e9rige en fait\nontologique, et on loge ce fait dans l'int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame du papier, en\nl'accouplant \u00e0 sa blancheur et \u00e0 sa minceur. Ce n'est pas un rapport\nextrins\u00e8que qu'on suppose, c'est une moiti\u00e9 du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne m\u00eame.\nJe crois qu'en somme on se repr\u00e9sente la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 comme constitu\u00e9e de la\nfa\u00e7on dont sont faites les \"couleurs\" qui nous servent \u00e0 la peinture. Il\ny a d'abord des mati\u00e8res colorantes qui r\u00e9pondent au contenu, et il y a\nun v\u00e9hicule, huile ou colle, qui les tient en suspension et qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0\nla conscience. C'est un dualisme complet, o\u00f9, en employant certains\nproc\u00e9d\u00e9s, on peut s\u00e9parer chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'autre par voie de\nsoustraction. C'est ainsi qu'on nous assure qu'en faisant un grand\neffort d'abstraction introspective, nous pouvons saisir notre\nconscience sur le vif, comme une activit\u00e9 spirituelle pure, en\nn\u00e9gligeant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s compl\u00e8tement les mati\u00e8res qu'\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9\nelle \u00e9claire.\nMaintenant je vous demande si on ne pourrait pas tout aussi bien\nrenverser absolument cette mani\u00e8re de voir. Supposons, en effet, que la\nr\u00e9alit\u00e9 premi\u00e8re soit de nature neutre, et appelons-la par quelque nom\nencore ambigu, comme _ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne_, _donn\u00e9_, _Vorfindung_. Moi-m\u00eame j'en\nparle volontiers au pluriel, et je lui donne le nom d'_exp\u00e9riences\npures_. Ce sera un monisme, si vous voulez, mais un monisme tout \u00e0 fait\nrudimentaire et absolument oppos\u00e9 au soi-disant monisme bilat\u00e9ral du\npositivisme scientifique ou spinoziste.\nCes exp\u00e9riences pures existent et se succ\u00e8dent, entrent dans des\nrapports infiniment vari\u00e9s les unes avec les autres, rapports qui sont\neux-m\u00eames des parties essentielles de la trame des exp\u00e9riences. Il y a\n\"Conscience\" de ces rapports au m\u00eame titre qu'il y a \"Conscience\" de\nleurs termes. Il en r\u00e9sulte que des _groupes_ d'exp\u00e9riences se font\nremarquer et distinguer, et qu'une seule et m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience, vu la\ngrande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses rapports, peut jouer un r\u00f4le dans plusieurs\ngroupes \u00e0 la fois. C'est ainsi que dans un certain contexte de voisins,\nelle serait class\u00e9e comme un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne physique, tandis que dans un\nautre entourage elle figurerait comme un fait de conscience, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s\ncomme une m\u00eame particule d'encre peut appartenir simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 deux\nlignes, l'une verticale, l'autre horizontale, pourvu qu'elle soit situ\u00e9e\n\u00e0 leur intersection.\nPrenons, pour fixer nos id\u00e9es, l'exp\u00e9rience que nous avons \u00e0 ce moment\ndu local o\u00f9 nous sommes, de ces murailles, de cette table, de ces\nchaises, de cet espace. Dans cette exp\u00e9rience pleine, concr\u00e8te et\nindivise, telle qu'elle est l\u00e0, donn\u00e9e, le monde physique objectif et le\nmonde int\u00e9rieur et personnel de chacun de nous se rencontrent et se\nfusionnent comme des lignes se fusionnent \u00e0 leur intersection. Comme\nchose physique, cette salle a des rapports avec tout le reste du\nb\u00e2timent, b\u00e2timent que nous autres nous ne connaissons et ne conna\u00eetrons\npas. Elle doit son existence \u00e0 toute une histoire de financiers,\nd'architectes, d'ouvriers. Elle p\u00e8se sur le sol; elle durera\nind\u00e9finiment dans le temps; si le feu y \u00e9clatait, les chaises et la\ntable qu'elle contient seraient vite r\u00e9duites en cendres.\nComme exp\u00e9rience personnelle, au contraire, comme chose \"rapport\u00e9e,\"\nconnue, consciente, cette salle a de tout autres tenants et\naboutissants. Ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents ne sont pas des ouvriers, ce sont nos\npens\u00e9es respectives de tout \u00e0 l'heure. Bient\u00f4t elle ne figurera que\ncomme un fait fugitif dans nos biographies, associ\u00e9 \u00e0 d'agr\u00e9ables\nsouvenirs. Comme exp\u00e9rience psychique, elle n'a aucun poids, son\nameublement n'est pas combustible. Elle n'exerce de force physique que\nsur nos seuls cerveaux, et beaucoup d'entre nous nient encore cette\ninfluence; tandis que la salle physique est en rapport d'influence\nphysique avec tout le reste du monde.\nEt pourtant c'est de la m\u00eame salle absolument qu'il s'agit dans les deux\ncas. Tant que nous ne faisons pas de physique sp\u00e9culative, tant que\nnous nous pla\u00e7ons dans le sens commun, c'est la salle vue et sentie qui\nest bien la salle physique. De quoi parlons-nous donc si ce n'est de\n_cela_, de cette m\u00eame partie de la nature mat\u00e9rielle que tous nos\nesprits, \u00e0 ce m\u00eame moment, embrassent, qui entre telle quelle dans\nl'exp\u00e9rience actuelle et intime de chacun de nous, et que notre souvenir\nregardera toujours comme une partie int\u00e9grante de notre histoire. C'est\nabsolument une m\u00eame \u00e9toffe qui figure simultan\u00e9ment, selon le contexte\nque l'on consid\u00e8re, comme fait mat\u00e9riel et physique, ou comme fait de\nconscience intime.\nJe crois donc qu'on ne saurait traiter conscience et mati\u00e8re comme \u00e9tant\nd'essence disparate. On n'obtient ni l'une ni l'autre par soustraction,\nen n\u00e9gligeant chaque fois l'autre moiti\u00e9 d'une exp\u00e9rience de composition\ndouble. Les exp\u00e9riences sont au contraire primitivement de nature plut\u00f4t\nsimple. Elles _deviennent_ conscientes dans leur entier, elles\n_deviennent_ physiques dans leur entier; et c'est _par voie d'addition_\nque ce r\u00e9sultat se r\u00e9alise. Pour autant que des exp\u00e9riences se\nprolongent dans le temps, entrent dans des rapports d'influence\nphysique, se brisant, se chauffant, s'\u00e9clairant, etc., mutuellement,\nnous en faisons un groupe \u00e0 part que nous appelons le monde physique.\nPour autant, au contraire, qu'elles sont fugitives, inertes\nphysiquement, que leur succession ne suit pas d'ordre d\u00e9termin\u00e9, mais\nsemble plut\u00f4t ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des caprices \u00e9motifs, nous en faisons un autre\ngroupe que nous appelons le monde psychique. C'est en entrant \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\ndans un grand nombre de ces groupes psychiques que cette salle devient\nmaintenant chose consciente, chose rapport\u00e9e, chose sue. En faisant\nd\u00e9sormais partie de nos biographies respectives, elle ne sera pas suivie\nde cette sotte et monotone r\u00e9p\u00e9tition d'elle-m\u00eame dans le temps qui\ncaract\u00e9rise son existence physique. Elle sera suivie, au contraire, par\nd'autres exp\u00e9riences qui seront discontinues avec elle, ou qui auront ce\ngenre tout particulier de continuit\u00e9 que nous appelons souvenir. Demain,\nelle aura eu sa place dans chacun de nos pass\u00e9s; mais les pr\u00e9sents\ndivers auxquels tous ces pass\u00e9s seront li\u00e9s demain seront bien\ndiff\u00e9rents du pr\u00e9sent dont cette salle jouira demain comme entit\u00e9\nphysique.\nLes deux genres de groupes sont form\u00e9s d'exp\u00e9riences, mais les rapports\ndes exp\u00e9riences entre elles diff\u00e8rent d'un groupe \u00e0 l'autre. C'est donc\npar addition d'autres ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes qu'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne donn\u00e9 devient conscient\nou connu, ce n'est pas par un d\u00e9doublement d'essence int\u00e9rieure. La\nconnaissance des choses leur _survient_, elle ne leur est pas immanente.\nCe n'est le fait ni d'un moi transcendental, ni d'une _Bewusstheit_ ou\nacte de conscience qui les animerait chacune. _Elles se connaissent\nl'une l'autre_, ou plut\u00f4t il y en a qui connaissent les autres; et le\nrapport que nous nommons connaissance n'est lui-m\u00eame, dans beaucoup de\ncas, qu'une suite d'exp\u00e9riences interm\u00e9diaires parfaitement susceptibles\nd'\u00eatre d\u00e9crites en termes concrets. Il n'est nullement le myst\u00e8re\ntranscendant o\u00f9 se sont complus tant de philosophes.\nMais ceci nous m\u00e8nerait beaucoup trop loin. Je ne puis entrer ici dans\ntous les replis de la th\u00e9orie de la connaissance, ou de ce que, vous\nautres Italiens, vous appelez la gnos\u00e9ologie. Je dois me contenter de\nces remarques \u00e9court\u00e9es, ou simples suggestions, qui sont, je le crains,\nencore bien obscures faute des d\u00e9veloppements n\u00e9cessaires.\nPermettez donc que je me r\u00e9sume--trop sommairement, et en style\ndogmatique--dans les six th\u00e8ses suivantes:\n*       *       *       *       *\n_1^o La Conscience, telle qu'on l'entend ordinairement, n'existe pas,\npas plus que la Mati\u00e8re, \u00e0 laquelle Berkeley a donn\u00e9 le coup de gr\u00e2ce;_\n_2^o Ce qui existe et forme la part de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que le mot de \"Conscience\"\nrecouvre, c'est la susceptibilit\u00e9 que poss\u00e8dent les parties de\nl'exp\u00e9rience d'\u00eatre rapport\u00e9es ou connues;_\n_3^o Cette susceptibilit\u00e9 s'explique par le fait que certaines\nexp\u00e9riences peuvent mener les unes aux autres par des exp\u00e9riences\ninterm\u00e9diaires nettement caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es, de telle sorte que les unes se\ntrouvent jouer le r\u00f4le de choses connues, les autres celui de sujets\nconnaissants;_\n_4^o On peut parfaitement d\u00e9finir ces deux r\u00f4les sans sortir de la\ntrame de l'exp\u00e9rience m\u00eame, et sans invoquer rien de transcendant;_\n_5^o Les attributions sujet et objet, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et repr\u00e9sentatif, chose\net pens\u00e9e, signifient donc une distinction pratique qui est de la\nderni\u00e8re importance, mais qui est d'ordre_ FONCTIONNEL _seulement, et\nnullement ontologique comme le dualisme classique se la repr\u00e9sente;_\n_6^o En fin de compte, les choses et les pens\u00e9es ne sont point\nfonci\u00e8rement h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes, mais elles sont faites d'une m\u00eame \u00e9toffe,\n\u00e9toffe qu'on ne peut d\u00e9finir comme telle, mais seulement \u00e9prouver, et\nque l'on peut nommer, si on veut, l'\u00e9toffe de l'exp\u00e9rience en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral._\nFOOTNOTES:\n[116] [A communication made (in French) at the Fifth International\nCongress of Psychology, in Rome, April 30, 1905.

[The series of articles referred to\nis reprinted above. ED.]\n[117] _The Sense of Beauty_, pp. 44 ff.\n[118] _The Life of Reason_ [vol. I, \"Reason in Common Sense,\" p. 142].\nIX\nIS RADICAL EMPIRICISM SOLIPSISTIC?[119]\nIf all the criticisms which the humanistic _Weltanschauung_ is receiving\nwere as _sachgem\u00e4ss_ as Mr. Bode's,[120] the truth of the matter would\nmore rapidly clear up. Not only is it excellently well written, but it\nbrings its own point of view out clearly, and admits of a perfectly\nstraight reply.\nThe argument (unless I fail to catch it) can be expressed as follows:\nIf a series of experiences be supposed, no one of which is endowed\nimmediately with the self-transcendent function of reference to a\nreality beyond itself, no motive will occur within the series for\nsupposing anything beyond it to exist. It will remain subjective, and\ncontentedly subjective, both as a whole and in its several parts.\nRadical empiricism, trying, as it does, to account for objective\nknowledge by means of such a series, egregiously fails. It can not\nexplain how the notion of a physical order, as distinguished from a\nsubjectively biographical order, of experiences, ever arose.\nIt pretends to explain the notion of a physical order, but does so by\nplaying fast and loose with the concept of objective reference. On the\none hand, it denies that such reference implies self-transcendency on\nthe part of any one experience; on the other hand, it claims that\nexperiences _point_. But, critically considered, there can be no\npointing unless self-transcendency be also allowed. The conjunctive\nfunction of pointing, as I have assumed it, is, according to my critic,\nvitiated by the fallacy of attaching a bilateral relation to a term _a\nquo_, as if it could stick out substantively and maintain itself in\nexistence in advance of the term _ad quem_ which is equally required for\nit to be a concretely experienced fact. If the relation be made\nconcrete, the term _ad quem_ is involved, which would mean (if I succeed\nin apprehending Mr. Bode rightly) that this latter term, although not\nempirically there, is yet _noetically_ there, in advance--in other words\nit would mean that any experience that 'points' must already have\ntranscended itself, in the ordinary 'epistemological' sense of the word\ntranscend.\nSomething like this, if I understand Mr. Bode's text, is the upshot of\nhis state of mind. It is a reasonable sounding state of mind, but it is\nexactly the state of mind which radical empiricism, by its doctrine of\nthe reality of conjunctive relations, seeks to dispel. I very much\nfear--so difficult does mutual understanding seem in these exalted\nregions--that my able critic has failed to understand that doctrine as\nit is meant to be understood. I suspect that he performs on all these\nconjunctive relations (of which the aforesaid 'pointing' is only one)\nthe usual rationalistic act of substitution--he takes them not as they\nare given in their first intention, as parts constitutive of\nexperience's living flow, but only as they appear in retrospect, each\nfixed as a determinate object of conception, static, therefore, and\ncontained within itself.\nAgainst this rationalistic tendency to treat experience as chopped up\ninto discontinuous static objects, radical empiricism protests. It\ninsists on taking conjunctions at their 'face-value,' just as they come.\nConsider, for example, such conjunctions as 'and,' 'with,' 'near,'\n'_plus_,' 'towards.' While we live in such conjunctions our state is one\nof _transition_ in the most literal sense. We are expectant of a 'more'\nto come, and before the more _has_ come, the transition, nevertheless,\nis directed _towards_ it. I fail otherwise to see how, if one kind of\nmore comes, there should be satisfaction and feeling of fulfilment; but\ndisappointment if the more comes in another shape. One more will\ncontinue, another more will arrest or deflect the direction, in which\nour experience is moving even now. We can not, it is true, _name_ our\ndifferent living 'ands' or 'withs' except by naming the different terms\ntowards which they are moving us, but we _live_ their specifications and\ndifferences before those terms explicitly arrive. Thus, though the\nvarious 'ands' are all bilateral relations, each requiring a term _ad\nquem_ to define it when viewed in retrospect and articulately conceived,\nyet in its living moment any one of them may be treated as if it 'stuck\nout' from its term _a quo_ and pointed in a special direction, much as a\ncompass-needle (to use Mr. Bode's excellent simile) points at the pole,\neven though it stirs not from its box.\nIn Professor H\u00f6ffding's massive little article in _The Journal of\nPhilosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods_,[121] he quotes a saying\nof Kierkegaard's to the effect that we live forwards, but we understand\nbackwards. Understanding backwards is, it must be confessed, a very\nfrequent weakness of philosophers, both of the rationalistic and of the\nordinary empiricist type. Radical empiricism alone insists on\nunderstanding forwards also, and refuses to substitute static concepts\nof the understanding for transitions in our moving life. A logic similar\nto that which my critic seems to employ here should, it seems to me,\nforbid him to say that our present is, while present, directed towards\nour future, or that any physical movement can have direction until its\ngoal is actually reached.\nAt this point does it not seem as if the quarrel about\nself-transcendency in knowledge might drop? Is it not a purely verbal\ndispute? Call it self-transcendency or call it pointing, whichever you\nlike--it makes no difference so long as real transitions towards real\ngoals are admitted as things given _in_ experience, and among\nexperience's most indefeasible parts. Radical empiricism, unable to\nclose its eyes to the transitions caught _in actu_, accounts for the\nself-transcendency or the pointing (whichever you may call it) as a\nprocess that occurs within experience, as an empirically mediated thing\nof which a perfectly definite description can be given. 'Epistemology,'\non the other hand, denies this; and pretends that the self-transcendency\nis unmediated or, if mediated, then mediated in a super-empirical world.\nTo justify this pretension, epistemology has first to transform all our\nconjunctions into static objects, and this, I submit, is an absolutely\narbitrary act. But in spite of Mr. Bode's mal-treatment of conjunctions,\nas I understand them--and as I understand him--I believe that at bottom\nwe are fighting for nothing different, but are both defending the same\ncontinuities of experience in different forms of words.\nThere are other criticisms in the article in question, but, as this\nseems the most vital one, I will for the present, at any rate, leave\nthem untouched.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[119] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

PITKIN'S REFUTATION OF 'RADICAL EMPIRICISM'[122]\nAlthough Mr. Pitkin does not name me in his acute article on radical\nempiricism,[123] [...] I fear that some readers, knowing me to have\napplied that name to my own doctrine, may possibly consider themselves\nto have been in at my death.\nIn point of fact my withers are entirely unwrung. I have, indeed,\nsaid[124] that 'to be radical, an empiricism must not admit into its\nconstructions any element that is not directly experienced.' But in my\nown radical empiricism this is only a _methodological postulate_, not a\nconclusion supposed to flow from the intrinsic absurdity of\ntransempirical objects. I have never felt the slightest respect for the\nidealistic arguments which Mr. Pitkin attacks and of which Ferrier made\nsuch striking use; and I am perfectly willing to admit any number of\nnoumenal beings or events into philosophy if only their pragmatic value\ncan be shown.\nRadical empiricism and pragmatism have so many misunderstandings to\nsuffer from, that it seems my duty not to let this one go any farther,\nuncorrected.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMr. Pitkin's 'reply' to me,[125] [...] perplexes me by the obscurity of\nstyle which I find in almost all our younger philosophers. He asks me,\nhowever, two direct questions which I understand, so I take the liberty\nof answering.\nFirst he asks: Do not experience and science show 'that countless things\nare[126] experienced as that which they are not or are only partially?'\nI reply: Yes, assuredly, as, for example, 'things' distorted by\nrefractive media, 'molecules,' or whatever else is taken to be more\nultimately real than the immediate content of the perceptive moment.\nSecondly: \"If experience is self-supporting[127] (in _any_ intelligible\nsense) does this fact preclude the possibility of (a) something not\nexperienced and (b) action of experience upon a noumenon?\"\nMy reply is: Assuredly not the possibility of either--how could it? Yet\nin my opinion we should be wise not to _consider_ any thing or action of\nthat nature, and to restrict our universe of philosophic discourse to\nwhat is experienced or, at least, experienceable.[128]\nFOOTNOTES:\n[122] [Reprinted from the _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

ED.]\nXI\nHUMANISM AND TRUTH ONCE MORE.[129]\nMr. Joseph's criticism of my article 'Humanism and Truth'[130] is a\nuseful contribution to the general clearing up. He has seriously tried\nto comprehend what the pragmatic movement may intelligibly mean; and if\nhe has failed, it is the fault neither of his patience nor of his\nsincerity, but rather of stubborn tricks of thought which he could not\neasily get rid of. Minute polemics, in which the parties try to rebut\nevery detail of each of the other's charges, are a useful exercise only\nto the disputants. They can but breed confusion in a reader. I will\ntherefore ignore as much as possible the text of both our articles (mine\nwas inadequate enough) and treat once more the general objective\nsituation.\nAs I apprehend the movement towards humanism, it is based on no\nparticular discovery or principle that can be driven into one precise\nformula which thereupon can be impaled upon a logical skewer. It is much\nmore like one of those secular changes that come upon public opinion\nover-night, as it were, borne upon tides 'too full for sound or foam,'\nthat survive all the crudities and extravagances of their advocates,\nthat you can pin to no one absolutely essential statement, nor kill by\nany one decisive stab.\nSuch have been the changes from aristocracy to democracy, from classic\nto romantic taste, from theistic to pantheistic feeling, from static to\nevolutionary ways of understanding life--changes of which we all have\nbeen spectators. Scholasticism still opposes to such changes the method\nof confutation by single decisive reasons, showing that the new view\ninvolves self-contradiction, or traverses some fundamental principle.\nThis is like stopping a river by planting a stick in the middle of its\nbed. Round your obstacle flows the water and 'gets there all the same.'\nIn reading Mr. Joseph, I am not a little reminded of those Catholic\nwriters who refute Darwinism by telling us that higher species can not\ncome from lower because _minus nequit gignere plus_, or that the notion\nof transformation is absurd, for it implies that species tend to their\nown destruction, and that would violate the principle that every reality\ntends to persevere in its own shape. The point of view is too myopic,\ntoo tight and close to take in the inductive argument. You can not\nsettle questions of fact by formal logic. I feel as if Mr. Joseph almost\npounced on my words singly, without giving the sentences time to get out\nof my mouth.\nThe one condition of understanding humanism is to become\ninductive-minded oneself, to drop rigorous definitions, and follow lines\nof least resistance 'on the whole.' \"In other words,\" Mr. Joseph may\nprobably say, \"resolve your intellect into a kind of slush.\" \"Even so,\"\nI make reply,--\"if you will consent to use no politer word.\" For\nhumanism, conceiving the more 'true' as the more 'satisfactory' (Dewey's\nterm) has to renounce sincerely rectilinear arguments and ancient ideals\nof rigor and finality. It is in just this temper of renunciation, so\ndifferent from that of pyrrhonistic scepticism, that the spirit of\nhumanism essentially consists. Satisfactoriness has to be measured by a\nmultitude of standards, of which some, for aught we know, may fail in\nany given case; and what is 'more' satisfactory than any alternative in\nsight, may to the end be a sum of _pluses_ and _minuses_, concerning\nwhich we can only trust that by ulterior corrections and improvements a\nmaximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day be\napproached. It means a real change of heart, a break with absolutistic\nhopes, when one takes up this view of the conditions of belief.\nThat humanism's critics have never imagined this attitude inwardly, is\nshown by their invariable tactics. They do not get into it far enough to\nsee objectively and from without what their own opposite notion of\ntruth is. Mr. Joseph is possessed by some such notion; he thinks his\nreaders to be full of it, he obeys it, works from it, but never even\nessays to tell us what it is. The nearest he comes to doing so is\nwhere[131] he says it is the way \"we ought to think,\" whether we be\npsychologically compelled to or not.\nOf course humanism agrees to this: it is only a manner of calling truth\nan ideal. But humanism explicates the summarizing word 'ought' into a\nmass of pragmatic motives from the midst of which our critics think that\ntruth itself takes flight. Truth is a name of double meaning. It stands\nnow for an abstract something defined only as that to which our thought\nought to conform; and again it stands for the concrete propositions\nwithin which we believe that conformity already reigns--they being so\nmany 'truths.' Humanism sees that the only conformity we ever have to\ndeal with concretely is that between our subjects and our predicates,\nusing these words in a very broad sense. It sees moreover that this\nconformity is 'validated' (to use Mr. Schiller's term) by an indefinite\nnumber of pragmatic tests that vary as the predicates and subjects vary.\nIf an S gets superseded by an SP that gives our mind a completer sum of\nsatisfactions, we always say, humanism points out, that we have advanced\nto a better position in regard to truth.\nNow many of our judgments thus attained are retrospective. The S'es, so\nthe judgment runs, were SP's already ere the fact was humanly recorded.\nCommon sense, struck by this state of things, now rearranges the whole\nfield; and traditional philosophy follows her example. The general\nrequirement that predicates must conform to their subject, they\ntranslate into an ontological theory. A most previous Subject of all is\nsubstituted for the lesser subjects and conceived of as an archetypal\nReality; and the conformity required of predicates in detail is\nreinterpreted as a relation which our whole mind, with all its subjects\nand predicates together, must get into with respect to this Reality.\nIt, meanwhile, is conceived as eternal, static, and unaffected by our\nthinking. Conformity to a non-human Archetype like this is probably the\nnotion of truth which my opponent shares with common sense and\nphilosophic rationalism.\nWhen now Humanism, fully admitting both the naturalness and the grandeur\nof this hypothesis, nevertheless points to its sterility, and declines\nto chime in with the substitution, keeping to the concrete and still\nlodging truth between the subjects and the predicates in detail, it\nprovokes the outcry which we hear and which my critic echoes.\nOne of the commonest parts of the outcry is that humanism is\nsubjectivistic altogether--it is supposed to labor under a necessity of\n'denying trans-perceptual reality.'[132] It is not hard to see how this\nmisconception of humanism may have arisen; and humanistic writers,\npartly from not having sufficiently guarded their expressions, and\npartly from not having yet \"got round\" (in the poverty of their\nliterature) to a full discussion of the subject, are doubtless in some\ndegree to blame. But I fail to understand how any one with a working\ngrasp of their principles can charge them wholesale with subjectivism. I\nmyself have never thought of humanism as being subjectivistic farther\nthan to this extent, that, inasmuch as it treats the thinker as being\nhimself one portion of reality, it must also allow that _some_ of the\nrealities that he declares for true are created by his being there. Such\nrealities of course are either acts of his, or relations between other\nthings and him, or relations between things, which, but for him, would\nnever have been traced. Humanists are subjectivistic, also in this,\nthat, unlike rationalists (who think they carry a warrant for the\nabsolute truth of what they now believe in in their present pocket),\nthey hold all present beliefs as subject to revision in the light of\nfuture experience. The future experience, however, may be of things\noutside the thinker; and that this is so the humanist may believe as\nfreely as any other kind of empiricist philosopher.\nThe critics of humanism (though here I follow them but darkly) appear to\nobject to any infusion whatever of subjectivism into truth. All must be\narchetypal; every truth must pre-exist to its perception. Humanism sees\nthat an enormous quantity of truth must be written down as having\npre-existed to its perception by us humans. In countless instances we\nfind it most satisfactory to believe that, though we were always\nignorant of the fact, it always _was_ a fact that S was SP. But humanism\nseparates this class of cases from those in which it is more\nsatisfactory to believe the opposite, e.g., that S is ephemeral, or P a\npassing event, or SP created by the perceiving act. Our critics seem on\nthe other hand, to wish to universalize the retrospective type of\ninstance. Reality must pre-exist to every assertion for which truth is\nclaimed. And, not content with this overuse of one particular type of\njudgment, our critics claim its monopoly. They appear to wish to cut off\nHumanism from its rights to any retrospection at all.\nHumanism says that satisfactoriness is what distinguishes the true from\nthe false. But satisfactoriness is both a subjective quality, and a\npresent one. _Ergo_ (the critics appear to reason) an object, _qu\u00e2_\ntrue, must always for humanism be both present and subjective, and a\nhumanist's belief can never be in anything that lives outside of the\nbelief itself or ante-dates it. Why so preposterous a charge should be\nso current, I find it hard to say. Nothing is more obvious than the fact\nthat both the objective and the past existence of the object may be the\nvery things about it that most seem satisfactory, and that most invite\nus to believe them. The past tense can figure in the humanist's world,\nas well of belief as of representation, quite as harmoniously as in the\nworld of any one else.\nMr. Joseph gives a special turn to this accusation. He charges me[133]\nwith being self-contradictory when I say that the main categories of\nthought were evolved in the course of experience itself. For I use these\nvery categories to define the course of experience by. Experience, as I\ntalk about it, is a product of their use; and yet I take it as true\nanteriorly to them. This seems to Mr. Joseph to be an absurdity. I hope\nit does not seem such to his readers; for if experiences can suggest\nhypotheses at all (and they notoriously do so) I can see no absurdity\nwhatever in the notion of a retrospective hypothesis having for its\nobject the very train of experiences by which its own being, along with\nthat of other things, has been brought about. If the hypothesis is\n'satisfactory' we must, of course, believe it to have been true\nanteriorly to its formulation by ourselves. Every explanation of a\npresent by a past seems to involve this kind of circle, which is not a\nvicious circle. The past is _causa existendi_ of the present, which in\nturn is _causa cognoscendi_ of the past. If the present were treated as\n_causa existendi_ of the past, the circle might indeed be vicious.\nClosely connected with this pseudo-difficulty is another one of wider\nscope and greater complication--more excusable therefore.[134]\nHumanism, namely, asking how truth in point of fact is reached, and\nseeing that it is by ever substituting more satisfactory for less\nsatisfactory opinions, is thereby led into a vague historic sketch of\ntruth's development. The earliest 'opinions,' it thinks, must have been\ndim, unconnected 'feelings,' and only little by little did more and more\norderly views of things replace them. Our own retrospective view of this\nwhole evolution is now, let us say, the latest candidate for 'truth' as\nyet reached in the process. To be a satisfactory candidate, it must give\nsome definite sort of a picture of what forces keep the process going.\nOn the subjective side we have a fairly definite picture--sensation,\nassociation, interest, hypothesis, these account in a general way for\nthe growth into a cosmos of the relative chaos with which the mind\nbegan.\nBut on the side of the object, so to call it roughly, our view is much\nless satisfactory. Of which of our many objects are we to believe that\nit truly _was_ there and at work before the human mind began? Time,\nspace, kind, number, serial order, cause, consciousness, are hard things\nnot to objectify--even transcendental idealism leaves them standing as\n'empirically real.' Substance, matter, force, fall down more easily\nbefore criticism, and secondary qualities make almost no resistance at\nall. Nevertheless, when we survey the field of speculation, from\nScholasticism through Kantism to Spencerism, we find an ever-recurring\ntendency to convert the pre-human into a merely logical object, an\nunknowable _ding-an-sich_, that but starts the process, or a vague\n_materia prima_ that but receives our forms.[135]\nThe reasons for this are not so much logical as they are material. We\ncan postulate an extra-mental _that_ freely enough (though some\nidealists have denied us the privilege), but when we have done so, the\n_what_ of it is hard to determine satisfactorily, because of the\noppositions and entanglements of the variously proposed _whats_ with one\nanother and with the history of the human mind. The literature of\nspeculative cosmology bears witness to this difficulty. Humanism suffers\nfrom it no more than any other philosophy suffers, but it makes all our\ncosmogonic theories so unsatisfactory that some thinkers seek relief in\nthe denial of any primal dualism. Absolute Thought or 'pure experience'\nis postulated, and endowed with attributes calculated to justify the\nbelief that it may 'run itself.' Both these truth-claiming hypotheses\nare non-dualistic in the old mind-and-matter sense; but the one is\nmonistic and the other pluralistic as to the world process itself. Some\nhumanists are non-dualists of this sort--I myself am one _und zwar_ of\nthe pluralistic brand. But doubtless dualistic humanists also exist, as\nwell as non-dualistic ones of the monistic wing.\nMr. Joseph pins these general philosophic difficulties on humanism\nalone, or possibly on me alone. My article spoke vaguely of a 'most\nchaotic pure experience' coming first, and building up the mind.[136]\nBut how can two structureless things interact so as to produce a\nstructure? my critic triumphantly asks. Of course they can't, as purely\nso-named entities. We must make additional hypotheses. We must beg a\nminimum of structure for them. The _kind_ of minimum that _might_ have\ntended to increase towards what we now find actually developed is the\nphilosophical desideratum here. The question is that of the most\nmaterially satisfactory hypothesis. Mr. Joseph handles it by formal\nlogic purely, as if he had no acquaintance with the logic of hypothesis\nat all.\nMr. Joseph again is much bewildered as to what a humanist can mean when\nhe uses the word knowledge. He tries to convict me[137] of vaguely\nidentifying it with any kind of good. Knowledge is a difficult thing to\ndefine briefly, and Mr. Joseph shows his own constructive hand here even\nless than in the rest of his article. I have myself put forth on\nseveral occasions a radically pragmatist account of knowledge,[138] the\nexistence of which account my critic probably does not know of--so\nperhaps I had better not say anything about knowledge until he reads and\nattacks that. I will say, however, that whatever the relation called\nknowing may itself prove to consist in, I can think of no conceivable\nkind of _object_ which may not become an object of knowledge on\nhumanistic principles as well as on the principles of any other\nphilosophy.[139]\nI confess that I am pretty steadily hampered by the habit, on the part\nof humanism's critics, of assuming that they have truer ideas than mine\nof truth and knowledge, the nature of which I must know of and can not\nneed to have re-defined. I have consequently to reconstruct these ideas\nin order to carry on the discussion (I have e.g. had to do so in some\nparts of this article) and I thereby expose myself to charges of\ncaricature. In one part of Mr. Joseph's attack, however, I rejoice that\nwe are free from this embarrassment. It is an important point and covers\nprobably a genuine difficulty, so I take it up last.\nWhen, following Schiller and Dewey, I define the true as that which\ngives the maximal combination of satisfactions, and say that\nsatisfaction is a many-dimensional term that can be realized in various\nways, Mr. Joseph replies, rightly enough, that the chief satisfaction of\na rational creature must always be his thought that what he believes is\n_true_, whether the truth brings him the satisfaction of collateral\nprofits or not. This would seem, however, to make of truth the prior\nconcept, and to relegate satisfaction to a secondary place.\nAgain, if to be satisfactory is what is meant by being true, _whose_\nsatisfactions, and _which_ of his satisfactions, are to count?\nDiscriminations notoriously have to be made; and the upshot is that only\nrational candidates and intellectual satisfactions stand the test. We\nare then driven to a purely theoretic notion of truth, and get out of\nthe pragmatic atmosphere altogether. And with this Mr. Joseph leaves\nus--truth is truth, and there is an end of the matter. But he makes a\nvery pretty show of convicting me of self-stultification in according to\nour purely theoretic satisfactions any place in the humanistic scheme.\nThey crowd the collateral satisfactions out of house and home, he\nthinks, and pragmatism has to go into bankruptcy if she recognizes them\nat all.\nThere is no room for disagreement about the facts here; but the\ndestructive force of the reasoning disappears as soon as we talk\nconcretely instead of abstractly, and ask, in our quality of good\npragmatists, just what the famous theoretic needs are known as and in\nwhat the intellectual satisfactions consist. Mr. Joseph, faithful to the\nhabits of his party, makes no attempt at characterizing them, but\nassumes that their nature is self-evident to all.\nAre they not all mere matters of _consistency_--and emphatically _not_\nof consistency between an Absolute Reality and the mind's copies of it,\nbut of actually felt consistency among judgments, objects, and manners\nof reacting, in the mind? And are not both our need of such consistency\nand our pleasure in it conceivable as outcomes of the natural fact that\nwe are beings that develop mental _habits_--habit itself proving\nadaptively beneficial in an environment where the same objects, or the\nsame kinds of objects, recur and follow 'law'? If this were so, what\nwould have come first would have been the collateral profits of habit,\nand the theoretic life would have grown up in aid of these. In point of\nfact this seems to have been the probable case. At life's origin, any\npresent perception may have been 'true'--if such a word could then be\napplicable. Later, when reactions became organized, the reactions became\n'true' whenever expectation was fulfilled by them. Otherwise they were\n'false' or 'mistaken' reactions. But the same class of objects needs the\nsame kind of reaction, so the impulse to react consistently must\ngradually have been established, with a disappointment felt whenever\nthe results frustrated expectation. Here is a perfectly plausible germ\nfor all our higher consistencies. Nowadays, if an object claims from us\na reaction of the kind habitually accorded only to the opposite class of\nobjects, our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly. The situation is\nintellectually unsatisfactory. To gain relief we seek either to preserve\nthe reaction by re-interpreting the object, or, leaving the object as it\nis, we react in a way contrary to the way claimed of us. Neither\nsolution is easy. Such a situation might be that of Mr. Joseph, with me\nclaiming assent to humanism from him. He can not apperceive it so as to\npermit him to gratify my claim; but there is enough appeal in the claim\nto induce him to write a whole article in justification of his refusal.\nIf he should assent to humanism, on the other hand, that would drag\nafter it an unwelcome, yea incredible, alteration of his previous mental\nbeliefs. Whichever alternative he might adopt, however, a new\nequilibrium of intellectual consistency would in the end be reached. He\nwould feel, whichever way he decided, that he was now thinking truly.\nBut if, with his old habits unaltered, he should simply add to them the\nnew one of advocating humanism quietly or noisily, his mind would be\nrent into two systems, each of which would accuse the other of\nfalsehood. The resultant situation, being profoundly unsatisfactory,\nwould also be instable.\nTheoretic truth is thus no relation between our mind and archetypal\nreality. It falls _within_ the mind, being the accord of some of its\nprocesses and objects with other processes and objects--'accord'\nconsisting here in well-definable relations. So long as the satisfaction\nof feeling such an accord is denied us, whatever collateral profits may\nseem to inure from what we believe in are but as dust in the\nbalance--provided always that we are highly organized intellectually,\nwhich the majority of us are not. The amount of accord which satisfies\nmost men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between their\nusual thoughts and statements and the limited sphere of\nsense-perceptions in which their lives are cast. The theoretic truth\nthat most of us think we 'ought' to attain to is thus the possession of\na set of predicates that do not contradict their subjects. We preserve\nit as often as not by leaving other predicates and subjects out.\nIn some men theory is a passion, just as music is in others. The form of\ninner consistency is pursued far beyond the line at which collateral\nprofits stop. Such men systematize and classify and schematize and make\nsynoptical tables and invent ideal objects for the pure love of\nunifying. Too often the results, glowing with 'truth' for the inventors,\nseem pathetically personal and artificial to bystanders. Which is as\nmuch as to say that the purely theoretic criterion of truth can leave us\nin the lurch as easily as any other criterion.\nI think that if Mr. Joseph will but consider all these things a little\nmore concretely, he may find that the humanistic scheme and the notion\nof theoretic truth fall into line consistently enough to yield him also\nintellectual satisfaction.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[129] [Reprinted without change from _Mind_, N.

Y.,\nNovember 4, 1904.\nXII\nABSOLUTISM AND EMPIRICISM[140]\nNo seeker of truth can fail to rejoice at the terre-\u00e0-terre sort of\ndiscussion of the issues between Empiricism and Transcendentalism (or,\nas the champions of the latter would probably prefer to say, between\nIrrationalism and Rationalism) that seems to have begun in _Mind_.[141]\nIt would seem as if, over concrete examples like Mr. J. S. Haldane's,\nboth parties ought inevitably to come to a better understanding. As a\nreader with a strong bias towards Irrationalism, I have studied his\narticle[142] with the liveliest admiration of its temper and its\npainstaking effort to be clear. But the cases discussed failed to\nsatisfy me, and I was at first tempted to write a Note animadverting\nupon them in detail. The growth of the limb, the sea's contour, the\nvicarious functioning of the nerve-centre, the digitalis curing the\nheart, are unfortunately _not_ cases where we can _see_ any\n_through-and-through_ conditioning of the parts by the whole. They are\nall cases of reciprocity where subjects, supposed independently to\nexist, acquire certain attributes through their relations to other\nsubjects. That they also _exist_ through similar relations is only an\nideal supposition, not verified to our understanding in these or any\nother concrete cases whatsoever.\nIf, however, one were to urge this solemnly, Mr. Haldane's friends could\neasily reply that he only gave us such examples on account of the\nhardness of our hearts. He knew full well their imperfection, but he\nhoped that to those who would not spontaneously ascend to the Notion of\nthe Totality, these cases might prove a spur and suggest and symbolize\nsomething better than themselves. No particular case that can be brought\nforward is a real concrete. They are all abstractions from the Whole,\nand of course the \"through-and-through\" character can not be found in\nthem. Each of them still contains among its elements what we call\n_things_, grammatical subjects, forming a sort of residual _caput\nmortuum_ of Existence after all the relations that figure in the\nexamples have been told off. On this \"existence,\" thinks popular\nphilosophy, things may live on, like the winter bears on their own fat,\nnever entering relations at all, or, if entering them, entering an\nentirely different set of them from those treated of in Mr. Haldane's\nexamples. Thus _if_ the digitalis were to weaken instead of\nstrengthening the heart, and to produce death (as sometimes happens), it\nwould determine itself, through determining the organism, to the\nfunction of \"kill\" instead of that of \"cure.\" The function and relation\nseem adventitious, depending on what kind of a heart the digitalis gets\nhold of, the digitalis and the heart being facts external and, so to\nspeak, accidental to each other. But this popular view, Mr. Haldane's\nfriends will continue, is an illusion. What seems to us the \"existence\"\nof digitalis and heart outside of the relations of killing or curing, is\nbut a function in a wider system of relations, of which, _pro hac vice_,\nwe take no account. The larger system determines the _existence_ just\nas absolutely as the system \"kill,\" or the system \"cure,\" determined the\n_function_ of the digitalis. Ascend to the absolute system, instead of\nbiding with these relative and partial ones, and you shall see that the\nlaw of through-and-throughness must and does obtain.\nOf course, this argument is entirely reasonable, and debars us\ncompletely from chopping logic about the concrete examples Mr. Haldane\nhas chosen. It is not his fault if his categories are so fine an\ninstrument that nothing but the sum total of things can be taken to show\nus the manner of their use. It is simply our misfortune that he has not\nthe sum total of things to show it by. Let us fall back from all\nconcrete attempts and see what we can do with his notion of\nthrough-and-throughness, avowedly taken _in abstracto_. In abstract\nsystems the \"through-and-through\" Ideal is realized on every hand. In\nany system, as such, the members are only _members_ in the system.\nAbolish the system and you abolish its members, for you have conceived\nthem through no other property than the abstract one of membership.\nNeither rightness nor leftness, except through bi-laterality. Neither\nmortgager nor mortgagee, except through mortgage. The logic of these\ncases is this:--_If_ A, then B; but _if_ B, then A: wherefore _if_\neither, Both; and if not Both, Nothing.\nIt costs nothing, not even a mental effort, to admit that the absolute\ntotality of things _may_ be organized exactly after the pattern of one\nof these \"through-and-through\" abstractions. In fact, it is the\npleasantest and freest of mental movements. Husband makes, and is made\nby, wife, through marriage; one makes other, by being itself other;\neverything self-created through its opposite--you go round like a\nsquirrel in a cage. But if you stop and reflect upon what you are about,\nyou lay bare the exact point at issue between common sense and the\n\"through-and-through\" school.\nWhat, in fact, is the logic of these abstract systems? It is, as we said\nabove: If any Member, then the Whole System; if not the Whole System,\nthen Nothing. But how can Logic possibly do anything more with these\ntwo hypotheses than combine them into the single disjunctive\nproposition--\"Either this Whole System, just as it stands, or Nothing at\nall.\" Is not that disjunction the ultimate word of Logic in the matter,\nand can any disjunction, as such, resolve _itself_? It may be that Mr.\nHaldane sees how one horn, the concept of the Whole System, carries real\nexistence with it. But if he has been as unsuccessful as I in\nassimilating the Hegelian re-editings of the Anselmian proof,[143] he\nwill have to say that though Logic may determine _what_ the system must\nbe, _if_ it is, something else than Logic must tell us _that_ it is. Mr.\nHaldane in this case would probably consciously, or unconsciously, make\nan appeal to Fact: the disjunction _is_ decided, since nobody can\ndispute that now, as a matter of fact, _something_, and not nothing,\n_is_. We must _therefore_, he would probably say, go on to admit the\nWhole System in the desiderated sense. Is not then the validity of the\nAnselmian proof the nucleus of the whole question between Logic and\nFact? Ought not the efforts of Mr. Haldane and his friends to be\nprincipally devoted to its elucidation? Is it not the real door of\nseparation between Empiricism and Rationalism? And if the Rationalists\nleave that door for a moment off its hinges, can any power keep that\nabstract, opaque, unmediated, external, irrational, and irresponsible\nmonster, known to the vulgar as bare Fact, from getting in and\ncontaminating the whole sanctuary with his presence? Can anything\nprevent Faust from changing \"Am Anfang war das Wort\" into \"Am Anfang war\ndie That?\"\nNothing in earth or heaven. Only the Anselmian proof can keep Fact out\nof philosophy. The question, \"Shall Fact be recognized as an ultimate\nprinciple?\" is the whole issue between the Rationalists and the\nEmpiricism of vulgar thought.\nOf course, if so recognized, Fact sets a limit to the\n\"through-and-through\" character of the world's rationality. That\nrationality might then mediate between all the members of our\nconception of the world, but not between the conception itself and\nreality. Reality would have to be given, not by Reason, but by Fact.\nFact holds out blankly, brutally and blindly, against that universal\ndeliquescence of everything into logical relations which the Absolutist\nLogic demands, and it is the only thing that does hold out. Hence the\nire of the Absolutist Logic--hence its non-recognition, its 'cutting' of\nFact.\nThe reasons it gives for the 'cutting' are that Fact is speechless, a\nmere word for the negation of thought, a vacuous unknowability, a\ndog-in-the-manger, in truth, which having no rights of its own, can find\nnothing else to do than to keep its betters out of theirs.\nThere are two points involved here: first the claim that certain things\nhave rights that are absolute, ubiquitous and all pervasive, and in\nregard to which nothing else can possibly exist in its _own_ right; and\nsecond that anything that denies _this_ assertion is _pure_ negativity\nwith no positive context whatsoever.\nTake the latter point first. Is it true that what is negative in one way\nis thereby convicted of incapacity to be positive in any other way? The\nword \"Fact\" is like the word \"Accident,\" like the word \"Absolute\"\nitself. They all have their negative connotation. In truth, their whole\nconnotation is negative and relative. All it says is that, whatever the\nthing may be that is denoted by the words, _other_ things do not control\nit. Where fact, where accident is, they must be silent, it alone can\nspeak. But that does not prevent its speaking as loudly as you please,\nin its own tongue. It may have an inward life, self-transparent and\nactive in the maximum degree. An indeterminate future volition on my\npart, for example, would be a strict accident as far as my present self\nis concerned. But that could not prevent it, _in the moment in which it\noccurred_, from being possibly the most intensely living and luminous\nexperience I ever had. Its quality of being a brute fact _ab extra_ says\nnothing whatever as to its inwardness. It simply says to _outsiders_:\n'Hands off!'\nAnd this brings us back to the first point of the Absolutist indictment\nof Fact. Is that point really anything more than a fantastic dislike to\nletting _anything_ say 'Hands off'? What else explains the contempt the\nAbsolutist authors exhibit for a freedom defined simply on its\n\"negative\" side, as freedom \"from,\" etc.? What else prompts them to\nderide such freedom? But, dislike for dislike, who shall decide? Why is\nnot their dislike at having me \"from\" them, entirely on a par with mine\nat having them \"through\" me?\nI know very well that in talking of dislikes to those who never mention\nthem, I am doing a very coarse thing, and making a sort of intellectual\nOrson of myself. But, for the life of me, I can not help it, because I\nfeel sure that likes and dislikes _must_ be among the ultimate factors\nof their philosophy as well as of mine. Would they but admit it! How\nsweetly we then could hold converse together! There is something finite\nabout us both, as we now stand. We do not know the Absolute Whole _yet_.\n_Part_ of it is still negative to us. Among the _whats_ of it still\nstalks a mob of opaque _thats_, without which we cannot think. But just\nas I admit that this is all possibly provisional, that even the\nAnselmian proof may come out all right, and creation _may_ be a rational\nsystem through-and-through, why might they not also admit that it may\nall be otherwise, and that the shadow, the opacity, the negativity, the\n\"from\"-ness, the plurality that is ultimate, _may_ never be wholly\ndriven from the scene. We should both then be avowedly making\nhypotheses, playing with Ideals. Ah! Why is the notion of hypothesis so\nabhorrent to the Hegelian mind?\nAnd once down on our common level of hypothesis, we might then admit\nscepticism, since the Whole is not yet revealed, to be the soundest\n_logical_ position. But since we are in the main not sceptics, we might\ngo on and frankly confess to each other the motives for our several\nfaiths. I frankly confess mine--I can not but think that at bottom they\nare of an \u00e6sthetic and not of a logical sort. The \"through-and-through\"\nuniverse seems to suffocate me with its infallible impeccable\nall-pervasiveness. Its necessity, with no possibilities; its relations,\nwith no subjects, make me feel as if I had entered into a contract with\nno reserved rights, or rather as if I had to live in a large seaside\nboarding-house with no private bed-room in which I might take refuge\nfrom the society of the place. I am distinctly aware, moreover, that the\nold quarrel of sinner and pharisee has something to do with the matter.\nCertainly, to my personal knowledge, all Hegelians are not prigs, but I\nsomehow feel as if all prigs ought to end, if developed, by becoming\nHegelians. There is a story of two clergymen asked by mistake to conduct\nthe same funeral. One came first and had got no farther than \"I am the\nResurrection and the Life,\" when the other entered. \"_I_ am the\nResurrection and the Life,\" cried the latter. The \"through-and-through\"\nphilosophy, as it actually exists, reminds many of us of that clergyman.\nIt seems too buttoned-up and white-chokered and clean-shaven a thing to\nspeak for the vast slow-breathing unconscious Kosmos with its dread\nabysses and its unknown tides. The \"freedom\" _we_ want to see there is\nnot the freedom, with a string tied to its leg and warranted not to fly\naway, of that philosophy. \"Let it fly away,\" we say, \"from _us_! What\nthen?\"\nAgain, I know I am exhibiting my mental grossness. But again, _Ich kann\nnicht anders._ I show my feelings; why _will_ they not show theirs? I\nknow they _have_ a personal feeling about the through-and-through\nuniverse, which is entirely different from mine, and which I should very\nlikely be much the better for gaining if they would only show me how.\nTheir persistence in telling me that feeling has nothing to do with the\nquestion, that it is a pure matter of absolute reason, keeps me for ever\nout of the pale. Still seeing a _that_ in things which Logic does not\nexpel, the most I can do is to _aspire_ to the expulsion. At present I\ndo not even aspire. Aspiration is a feeling. What can kindle feeling but\nthe example of feeling? And if the Hegelians _will_ refuse to set an\nexample, what can they expect the rest of us to do? To speak more\nseriously, the one _fundamental_ quarrel Empiricism has with Absolutism\nis over this repudiation by Absolutism of the personal and \u00e6sthetic\nfactor in the construction of philosophy. That we all of us have\nfeelings, Empiricism feels quite sure. That they may be as prophetic and\nanticipatory of truth as anything else we have, and some of them more so\nthan others, can not possibly be denied. But what hope is there of\nsquaring and settling opinions unless Absolutism will hold parley on\nthis common ground; and will admit that all philosophies are hypotheses,\nto which all our faculties, emotional as well as logical, help us, and\nthe truest of which will at the final integration of things be found in\npossession of the men whose faculties on the whole had the best divining\npower?\nFOOTNOTES:\n[140] [Reprinted from _Mind_, vol.

G.\nIN FILIAL GRATITUDE AND LOVE\nPREFACE.\nThis book would never have been written had I not been honored with an\nappointment as Gifford Lecturer on Natural Religion at the University of\nEdinburgh. In casting about me for subjects of the two courses of ten\nlectures each for which I thus became responsible, it seemed to me that\nthe first course might well be a descriptive one on \u201cMan\u2019s Religious\nAppetites,\u201d and the second a metaphysical one on \u201cTheir Satisfaction\nthrough Philosophy.\u201d But the unexpected growth of the psychological matter\nas I came to write it out has resulted in the second subject being\npostponed entirely, and the description of man\u2019s religious constitution\nnow fills the twenty lectures. In Lecture XX I have suggested rather than\nstated my own philosophic conclusions, and the reader who desires\nimmediately to know them should turn to pages 511\u2010519, and to the\n\u201cPostscript\u201d of the book. I hope to be able at some later day to express\nthem in more explicit form.\nIn my belief that a large acquaintance with particulars often makes us\nwiser than the possession of abstract formulas, however deep, I have\nloaded the lectures with concrete examples, and I have chosen these among\nthe extremer expressions of the religious temperament. To some readers I\nmay consequently seem, before they get beyond the middle of the book, to\noffer a caricature of the subject. Such convulsions of piety, they will\nsay, are not sane. If, however, they will have the patience to read to the\nend, I believe that this unfavorable impression will disappear; for I\nthere combine the religious impulses with other principles of common sense\nwhich serve as correctives of exaggeration, and allow the individual\nreader to draw as moderate conclusions as he will.\nMy thanks for help in writing these lectures are due to Edwin D. Starbuck,\nof Stanford University, who made over to me his large collection of\nmanuscript material; to Henry W. Rankin, of East Northfield, a friend\nunseen but proved, to whom I owe precious information; to Theodore\nFlournoy, of Geneva, to Canning Schiller, of Oxford, and to my colleague\nBenjamin Rand, for documents; to my colleague Dickinson S. Miller, and to\nmy friends, Thomas Wren Ward, of New York, and Wincenty Lutoslawski, late\nof Cracow, for important suggestions and advice. Finally, to conversations\nwith the lamented Thomas Davidson and to the use of his books, at\nGlenmore, above Keene Valley, I owe more obligations than I can well\nexpress.\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY,\nMarch, 1902.\nLECTURE I. RELIGION AND NEUROLOGY.\nIt is with no small amount of trepidation that I take my place behind this\ndesk, and face this learned audience. To us Americans, the experience of\nreceiving instruction from the living voice, as well as from the books, of\nEuropean scholars, is very familiar. At my own University of Harvard, not\na winter passes without its harvest, large or small, of lectures from\nScottish, English, French, or German representatives of the science or\nliterature of their respective countries whom we have either induced to\ncross the ocean to address us, or captured on the wing as they were\nvisiting our land. It seems the natural thing for us to listen whilst the\nEuropeans talk. The contrary habit, of talking whilst the Europeans\nlisten, we have not yet acquired; and in him who first makes the adventure\nit begets a certain sense of apology being due for so presumptuous an act.\nParticularly must this be the case on a soil as sacred to the American\nimagination as that of Edinburgh. The glories of the philosophic chair of\nthis university were deeply impressed on my imagination in boyhood.\nProfessor Fraser\u2019s Essays in Philosophy, then just published, was the\nfirst philosophic book I ever looked into, and I well remember the awe\u2010\nstruck feeling I received from the account of Sir William Hamilton\u2019s\nclass\u2010room therein contained. Hamilton\u2019s own lectures were the first\nphilosophic writings I ever forced myself to study, and after that I was\nimmersed in Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown. Such juvenile emotions of\nreverence never get outgrown; and I confess that to find my humble self\npromoted from my native wilderness to be actually for the time an official\nhere, and transmuted into a colleague of these illustrious names, carries\nwith it a sense of dreamland quite as much as of reality.\nBut since I have received the honor of this appointment I have felt that\nit would never do to decline. The academic career also has its heroic\nobligations, so I stand here without further deprecatory words. Let me say\nonly this, that now that the current, here and at Aberdeen, has begun to\nrun from west to east, I hope it may continue to do so. As the years go\nby, I hope that many of my countrymen may be asked to lecture in the\nScottish universities, changing places with Scotsmen lecturing in the\nUnited States; I hope that our people may become in all these higher\nmatters even as one people; and that the peculiar philosophic temperament,\nas well as the peculiar political temperament, that goes with our English\nspeech may more and more pervade and influence the world.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nAs regards the manner in which I shall have to administer this\nlectureship, I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the\nhistory of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch\nof learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the\nreligious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other\nof the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem,\ntherefore, that, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to\ninvite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities.\nIf the inquiry be psychological, not religious institutions, but rather\nreligious feelings and religious impulses must be its subject, and I must\nconfine myself to those more developed subjective phenomena recorded in\nliterature produced by articulate and fully self\u2010conscious men, in works\nof piety and autobiography. Interesting as the origins and early stages of\na subject always are, yet when one seeks earnestly for its full\nsignificance, one must always look to its more completely evolved and\nperfect forms. It follows from this that the documents that will most\nconcern us will be those of the men who were most accomplished in the\nreligious life and best able to give an intelligible account of their\nideas and motives. These men, of course, are either comparatively modern\nwriters, or else such earlier ones as have become religious classics. The\n_documents humains_ which we shall find most instructive need not then be\nsought for in the haunts of special erudition\u2014they lie along the beaten\nhighway; and this circumstance, which flows so naturally from the\ncharacter of our problem, suits admirably also your lecturer\u2019s lack of\nspecial theological learning. I may take my citations, my sentences and\nparagraphs of personal confession, from books that most of you at some\ntime will have had already in your hands, and yet this will be no\ndetriment to the value of my conclusions. It is true that some more\nadventurous reader and investigator, lecturing here in future, may unearth\nfrom the shelves of libraries documents that will make a more delectable\nand curious entertainment to listen to than mine. Yet I doubt whether he\nwill necessarily, by his control of so much more out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010way material,\nget much closer to the essence of the matter in hand.\nThe question, What are the religious propensities? and the question, What\nis their philosophic significance? are two entirely different orders of\nquestion from the logical point of view; and, as a failure to recognize\nthis fact distinctly may breed confusion, I wish to insist upon the point\na little before we enter into the documents and materials to which I have\nreferred.\nIn recent books on logic, distinction is made between two orders of\ninquiry concerning anything. First, what is the nature of it? how did it\ncome about? what is its constitution, origin, and history? And second,\nWhat is its importance, meaning, or significance, now that it is once\nhere? The answer to the one question is given in an _existential judgment_\nor proposition. The answer to the other is a _proposition of value_, what\nthe Germans call a _Werthurtheil_, or what we may, if we like, denominate\na _spiritual judgment_. Neither judgment can be deduced immediately from\nthe other. They proceed from diverse intellectual preoccupations, and the\nmind combines them only by making them first separately, and then adding\nthem together.\nIn the matter of religions it is particularly easy to distinguish the two\norders of question. Every religious phenomenon has its history and its\nderivation from natural antecedents. What is nowadays called the higher\ncriticism of the Bible is only a study of the Bible from this existential\npoint of view, neglected too much by the earlier church. Under just what\nbiographic conditions did the sacred writers bring forth their various\ncontributions to the holy volume? And what had they exactly in their\nseveral individual minds, when they delivered their utterances? These are\nmanifestly questions of historical fact, and one does not see how the\nanswer to them can decide offhand the still further question: of what use\nshould such a volume, with its manner of coming into existence so defined,\nbe to us as a guide to life and a revelation? To answer this other\nquestion we must have already in our mind some sort of a general theory as\nto what the peculiarities in a thing should be which give it value for\npurposes of revelation; and this theory itself would be what I just called\na spiritual judgment. Combining it with our existential judgment, we might\nindeed deduce another spiritual judgment as to the Bible\u2019s worth. Thus if\nour theory of revelation\u2010value were to affirm that any book, to possess\nit, must have been composed automatically or not by the free caprice of\nthe writer, or that it must exhibit no scientific and historic errors and\nexpress no local or personal passions, the Bible would probably fare ill\nat our hands. But if, on the other hand, our theory should allow that a\nbook may well be a revelation in spite of errors and passions and\ndeliberate human composition, if only it be a true record of the inner\nexperiences of great\u2010souled persons wrestling with the crises of their\nfate, then the verdict would be much more favorable. You see that the\nexistential facts by themselves are insufficient for determining the\nvalue; and the best adepts of the higher criticism accordingly never\nconfound the existential with the spiritual problem. With the same\nconclusions of fact before them, some take one view, and some another, of\nthe Bible\u2019s value as a revelation, according as their spiritual judgment\nas to the foundation of values differs.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI make these general remarks about the two sorts of judgment, because\nthere are many religious persons\u2014some of you now present, possibly, are\namong them\u2014who do not yet make a working use of the distinction, and who\nmay therefore feel at first a little startled at the purely existential\npoint of view from which in the following lectures the phenomena of\nreligious experience must be considered. When I handle them biologically\nand psychologically as if they were mere curious facts of individual\nhistory, some of you may think it a degradation of so sublime a subject,\nand may even suspect me, until my purpose gets more fully expressed, of\ndeliberately seeking to discredit the religious side of life.\nSuch a result is of course absolutely alien to my intention; and since\nsuch a prejudice on your part would seriously obstruct the due effect of\nmuch of what I have to relate, I will devote a few more words to the\npoint.\nThere can be no doubt that as a matter of fact a religious life,\nexclusively pursued, does tend to make the person exceptional and\neccentric. I speak not now of your ordinary religious believer, who\nfollows the conventional observances of his country, whether it be\nBuddhist, Christian, or Mohammedan. His religion has been made for him by\nothers, communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by\nimitation, and retained by habit. It would profit us little to study this\nsecond\u2010hand religious life. We must make search rather for the original\nexperiences which were the pattern\u2010setters to all this mass of suggested\nfeeling and imitated conduct. These experiences we can only find in\nindividuals for whom religion exists not as a dull habit, but as an acute\nfever rather. But such individuals are \u201cgeniuses\u201d in the religious line;\nand like many other geniuses who have brought forth fruits effective\nenough for commemoration in the pages of biography, such religious\ngeniuses have often shown symptoms of nervous instability. Even more\nperhaps than other kinds of genius, religious leaders have been subject to\nabnormal psychical visitations. Invariably they have been creatures of\nexalted emotional sensibility. Often they have led a discordant inner\nlife, and had melancholy during a part of their career. They have known no\nmeasure, been liable to obsessions and fixed ideas; and frequently they\nhave fallen into trances, heard voices, seen visions, and presented all\nsorts of peculiarities which are ordinarily classed as pathological.\nOften, moreover, these pathological features in their career have helped\nto give them their religious authority and influence.\nIf you ask for a concrete example, there can be no better one than is\nfurnished by the person of George Fox. The Quaker religion which he\nfounded is something which it is impossible to overpraise. In a day of\nshams, it was a religion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a\nreturn to something more like the original gospel truth than men had ever\nknown in England. So far as our Christian sects to\u2010day are evolving into\nliberality, they are simply reverting in essence to the position which Fox\nand the early Quakers so long ago assumed. No one can pretend for a moment\nthat in point of spiritual sagacity and capacity, Fox\u2019s mind was unsound.\nEvery one who confronted him personally, from Oliver Cromwell down to\ncounty magistrates and jailers, seems to have acknowledged his superior\npower. Yet from the point of view of his nervous constitution, Fox was a\npsychopath or _d\u00e9traqu\u00e9_ of the deepest dye. His Journal abounds in\nentries of this sort:\u2014\n\u201cAs I was walking with several friends, I lifted up my head, and\nsaw three steeple\u2010house spires, and they struck at my life. I\nasked them what place that was? They said, Lichfield. Immediately\nthe word of the Lord came to me, that I must go thither. Being\ncome to the house we were going to, I wished the friends to walk\ninto the house, saying nothing to them of whither I was to go. As\nsoon as they were gone I stept away, and went by my eye over hedge\nand ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield; where, in a\ngreat field, shepherds were keeping their sheep. Then was I\ncommanded by the Lord to pull off my shoes. I stood still, for it\nwas winter: but the word of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I\nput off my shoes, and left them with the shepherds; and the poor\nshepherds trembled, and were astonished. Then I walked on about a\nmile, and as soon as I was got within the city, the word of the\nLord came to me again, saying: Cry, \u2018Wo to the bloody city of\nLichfield!\u2019 So I went up and down the streets, crying with a loud\nvoice, Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield! It being market day, I\nwent into the market\u2010place, and to and fro in the several parts of\nit, and made stands, crying as before, Wo to the bloody city of\nLichfield! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus crying\nthrough the streets, there seemed to me to be a channel of blood\nrunning down the streets, and the market\u2010place appeared like a\npool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt\nmyself clear, I went out of the town in peace; and returning to\nthe shepherds gave them some money, and took my shoes of them\nagain. But the fire of the Lord was so on my feet, and all over\nme, that I did not matter to put on my shoes again, and was at a\nstand whether I should or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord so\nto do: then, after I had washed my feet, I put on my shoes again.\nAfter this a deep consideration came upon me, for what reason I\nshould be sent to cry against that city, and call it The bloody\ncity! For though the parliament had the minister one while, and\nthe king another, and much blood had been shed in the town during\nthe wars between them, yet there was no more than had befallen\nmany other places. But afterwards I came to understand, that in\nthe Emperor Diocletian\u2019s time a thousand Christians were martyr\u2019d\nin Lichfield. So I was to go, without my shoes, through the\nchannel of their blood, and into the pool of their blood in the\nmarket\u2010place, that I might raise up the memorial of the blood of\nthose martyrs, which had been shed above a thousand years before,\nand lay cold in their streets. So the sense of this blood was upon\nme, and I obeyed the word of the Lord.\u201d\nBent as we are on studying religion\u2019s existential conditions, we cannot\npossibly ignore these pathological aspects of the subject. We must\ndescribe and name them just as if they occurred in non\u2010religious men. It\nis true that we instinctively recoil from seeing an object to which our\nemotions and affections are committed handled by the intellect as any\nother object is handled. The first thing the intellect does with an object\nis to class it along with something else. But any object that is\ninfinitely important to us and awakens our devotion feels to us also as if\nit must be _sui generis_ and unique. Probably a crab would be filled with\na sense of personal outrage if it could hear us class it without ado or\napology as a crustacean, and thus dispose of it. \u201cI am no such thing,\u201d it\nwould say; \u201cI am MYSELF, MYSELF alone.\u201d\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next thing the intellect does is to lay bare the causes in which the\nthing originates. Spinoza says: \u201cI will analyze the actions and appetites\nof men as if it were a question of lines, of planes, and of solids.\u201d And\nelsewhere he remarks that he will consider our passions and their\nproperties with the same eye with which he looks on all other natural\nthings, since the consequences of our affections flow from their nature\nwith the same necessity as it results from the nature of a triangle that\nits three angles should be equal to two right angles. Similarly M. Taine,\nin the introduction to his history of English literature, has written:\n\u201cWhether facts be moral or physical, it makes no matter. They always have\ntheir causes. There are causes for ambition, courage, veracity, just as\nthere are for digestion, muscular movement, animal heat. Vice and virtue\nare products like vitriol and sugar.\u201d When we read such proclamations of\nthe intellect bent on showing the existential conditions of absolutely\neverything, we feel\u2014quite apart from our legitimate impatience at the\nsomewhat ridiculous swagger of the program, in view of what the authors\nare actually able to perform\u2014menaced and negated in the springs of our\ninnermost life. Such cold\u2010blooded assimilations threaten, we think, to\nundo our soul\u2019s vital secrets, as if the same breath which should succeed\nin explaining their origin would simultaneously explain away their\nsignificance, and make them appear of no more preciousness, either, than\nthe useful groceries of which M. Taine speaks.\nPerhaps the commonest expression of this assumption that spiritual value\nis undone if lowly origin be asserted is seen in those comments which\nunsentimental people so often pass on their more sentimental\nacquaintances. Alfred believes in immortality so strongly because his\ntemperament is so emotional. Fanny\u2019s extraordinary conscientiousness is\nmerely a matter of over\u2010instigated nerves. William\u2019s melancholy about the\nuniverse is due to bad digestion\u2014probably his liver is torpid. Eliza\u2019s\ndelight in her church is a symptom of her hysterical constitution. Peter\nwould be less troubled about his soul if he would take more exercise in\nthe open air, etc. A more fully developed example of the same kind of\nreasoning is the fashion, quite common nowadays among certain writers, of\ncriticising the religious emotions by showing a connection between them\nand the sexual life. Conversion is a crisis of puberty and adolescence.\nThe macerations of saints, and the devotion of missionaries, are only\ninstances of the parental instinct of self\u2010sacrifice gone astray. For the\nhysterical nun, starving for natural life, Christ is but an imaginary\nsubstitute for a more earthly object of affection. And the like.(1)\nWe are surely all familiar in a general way with this method of\ndiscrediting states of mind for which we have an antipathy. We all use it\nto some degree in criticising persons whose states of mind we regard as\noverstrained. But when other people criticise our own more exalted soul\u2010\nflights by calling them \u201cnothing but\u201d expressions of our organic\ndisposition, we feel outraged and hurt, for we know that, whatever be our\norganism\u2019s peculiarities, our mental states have their substantive value\nas revelations of the living truth; and we wish that all this medical\nmaterialism could be made to hold its tongue.\nMedical materialism seems indeed a good appellation for the too simple\u2010\nminded system of thought which we are considering. Medical materialism\nfinishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision on the road to Damascus a\ndischarging lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic. It\nsnuffs out Saint Teresa as an hysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi as an\nhereditary degenerate. George Fox\u2019s discontent with the shams of his age,\nand his pining for spiritual veracity, it treats as a symptom of a\ndisordered colon. Carlyle\u2019s organ\u2010tones of misery it accounts for by a\ngastro\u2010duodenal catarrh. All such mental over\u2010tensions, it says, are, when\nyou come to the bottom of the matter, mere affairs of diathesis (auto\u2010\nintoxications most probably), due to the perverted action of various\nglands which physiology will yet discover.\nAnd medical materialism then thinks that the spiritual authority of all\nsuch personages is successfully undermined.(2)\nLet us ourselves look at the matter in the largest possible way. Modern\npsychology, finding definite psycho\u2010physical connections to hold good,\nassumes as a convenient hypothesis that the dependence of mental states\nupon bodily conditions must be thorough\u2010going and complete. If we adopt\nthe assumption, then of course what medical materialism insists on must be\ntrue in a general way, if not in every detail: Saint Paul certainly had\nonce an epileptoid, if not an epileptic seizure; George Fox was an\nhereditary degenerate; Carlyle was undoubtedly auto\u2010intoxicated by some\norgan or other, no matter which,\u2014and the rest. But now, I ask you, how can\nsuch an existential account of facts of mental history decide in one way\nor another upon their spiritual significance? According to the general\npostulate of psychology just referred to, there is not a single one of our\nstates of mind, high or low, healthy or morbid, that has not some organic\nprocess as its condition. Scientific theories are organically conditioned\njust as much as religious emotions are; and if we only knew the facts\nintimately enough, we should doubtless see \u201cthe liver\u201d determining the\ndicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as it does those of the\nMethodist under conviction anxious about his soul. When it alters in one\nway the blood that percolates it, we get the methodist, when in another\nway, we get the atheist form of mind. So of all our raptures and our\ndrynesses, our longings and pantings, our questions and beliefs. They are\nequally organically founded, be they of religious or of non\u2010religious\ncontent.\nTo plead the organic causation of a religious state of mind, then, in\nrefutation of its claim to possess superior spiritual value, is quite\nillogical and arbitrary, unless one have already worked out in advance\nsome psycho\u2010physical theory connecting spiritual values in general with\ndeterminate sorts of physiological change. Otherwise none of our thoughts\nand feelings, not even our scientific doctrines, not even our\n_dis_\u2010beliefs, could retain any value as revelations of the truth, for\nevery one of them without exception flows from the state of their\npossessor\u2019s body at the time.\nIt is needless to say that medical materialism draws in point of fact no\nsuch sweeping skeptical conclusion. It is sure, just as every simple man\nis sure, that some states of mind are inwardly superior to others, and\nreveal to us more truth, and in this it simply makes use of an ordinary\nspiritual judgment. It has no physiological theory of the production of\nthese its favorite states, by which it may accredit them; and its attempt\nto discredit the states which it dislikes, by vaguely associating them\nwith nerves and liver, and connecting them with names connoting bodily\naffliction, is altogether illogical and inconsistent.\nLet us play fair in this whole matter, and be quite candid with ourselves\nand with the facts. When we think certain states of mind superior to\nothers, is it ever because of what we know concerning their organic\nantecedents? No! it is always for two entirely different reasons. It is\neither because we take an immediate delight in them; or else it is because\nwe believe them to bring us good consequential fruits for life. When we\nspeak disparagingly of \u201cfeverish fancies,\u201d surely the fever\u2010process as\nsuch is not the ground of our disesteem\u2014for aught we know to the contrary,\n103\u00b0 or 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit might be a much more favorable temperature for\ntruths to germinate and sprout in, than the more ordinary blood\u2010heat of 97\nor 98 degrees. It is either the disagreeableness itself of the fancies, or\ntheir inability to bear the criticisms of the convalescent hour. When we\npraise the thoughts which health brings, health\u2019s peculiar chemical\nmetabolisms have nothing to do with determining our judgment. We know in\nfact almost nothing about these metabolisms. It is the character of inner\nhappiness in the thoughts which stamps them as good, or else their\nconsistency with our other opinions and their serviceability for our\nneeds, which make them pass for true in our esteem.\nNow the more intrinsic and the more remote of these criteria do not always\nhang together. Inner happiness and serviceability do not always agree.\nWhat immediately feels most \u201cgood\u201d is not always most \u201ctrue,\u201d when\nmeasured by the verdict of the rest of experience. The difference between\nPhilip drunk and Philip sober is the classic instance in corroboration. If\nmerely \u201cfeeling good\u201d could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely\nvalid human experience. But its revelations, however acutely satisfying at\nthe moment, are inserted into an environment which refuses to bear them\nout for any length of time. The consequence of this discrepancy of the two\ncriteria is the uncertainty which still prevails over so many of our\nspiritual judgments. There are moments of sentimental and mystical\nexperience\u2014we shall hereafter hear much of them\u2014that carry an enormous\nsense of inner authority and illumination with them when they come. But\nthey come seldom, and they do not come to every one; and the rest of life\nmakes either no connection with them, or tends to contradict them more\nthan it confirms them. Some persons follow more the voice of the moment in\nthese cases, some prefer to be guided by the average results. Hence the\nsad discordancy of so many of the spiritual judgments of human beings; a\ndiscordancy which will be brought home to us acutely enough before these\nlectures end.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIt is, however, a discordancy that can never be resolved by any merely\nmedical test. A good example of the impossibility of holding strictly to\nthe medical tests is seen in the theory of the pathological causation of\ngenius promulgated by recent authors. \u201cGenius,\u201d said Dr. Moreau, \u201cis but\none of the many branches of the neuropathic tree.\u201d \u201cGenius,\u201d says Dr.\nLombroso, \u201cis a symptom of hereditary degeneration of the epileptoid\nvariety, and is allied to moral insanity.\u201d \u201cWhenever a man\u2019s life,\u201d writes\nMr. Nisbet, \u201cis at once sufficiently illustrious and recorded with\nsufficient fullness to be a subject of profitable study, he inevitably\nfalls into the morbid category.... And it is worthy of remark that, as a\nrule, the greater the genius, the greater the unsoundness.\u201d(3)\nNow do these authors, after having succeeded in establishing to their own\nsatisfaction that the works of genius are fruits of disease, consistently\nproceed thereupon to impugn the _value_ of the fruits? Do they deduce a\nnew spiritual judgment from their new doctrine of existential conditions?\nDo they frankly forbid us to admire the productions of genius from now\nonwards? and say outright that no neuropath can ever be a revealer of new\ntruth?\nNo! their immediate spiritual instincts are too strong for them here, and\nhold their own against inferences which, in mere love of logical\nconsistency, medical materialism ought to be only too glad to draw. One\ndisciple of the school, indeed, has striven to impugn the value of works\nof genius in a wholesale way (such works of contemporary art, namely, as\nhe himself is unable to enjoy, and they are many) by using medical\narguments.(4) But for the most part the masterpieces are left\nunchallenged; and the medical line of attack either confines itself to\nsuch secular productions as every one admits to be intrinsically\neccentric, or else addresses itself exclusively to religious\nmanifestations. And then it is because the religious manifestations have\nbeen already condemned because the critic dislikes them on internal or\nspiritual grounds.\nIn the natural sciences and industrial arts it never occurs to any one to\ntry to refute opinions by showing up their author\u2019s neurotic constitution.\nOpinions here are invariably tested by logic and by experiment, no matter\nwhat may be their author\u2019s neurological type. It should be no otherwise\nwith religious opinions. Their value can only be ascertained by spiritual\njudgments directly passed upon them, judgments based on our own immediate\nfeeling primarily; and secondarily on what we can ascertain of their\nexperiential relations to our moral needs and to the rest of what we hold\nas true.\n_Immediate luminousness_, in short, _philosophical reasonableness_, and\n_moral helpfulness_ are the only available criteria. Saint Teresa might\nhave had the nervous system of the placidest cow, and it would not now\nsave her theology, if the trial of the theology by these other tests\nshould show it to be contemptible. And conversely if her theology can\nstand these other tests, it will make no difference how hysterical or\nnervously off her balance Saint Teresa may have been when she was with us\nhere below.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nYou see that at bottom we are thrown back upon the general principles by\nwhich the empirical philosophy has always contended that we must be guided\nin our search for truth. Dogmatic philosophies have sought for tests for\ntruth which might dispense us from appealing to the future. Some direct\nmark, by noting which we can be protected immediately and absolutely, now\nand forever, against all mistake\u2014such has been the darling dream of\nphilosophic dogmatists. It is clear that the _origin_ of the truth would\nbe an admirable criterion of this sort, if only the various origins could\nbe discriminated from one another from this point of view, and the history\nof dogmatic opinion shows that origin has always been a favorite test.\nOrigin in immediate intuition; origin in pontifical authority; origin in\nsupernatural revelation, as by vision, hearing, or unaccountable\nimpression; origin in direct possession by a higher spirit, expressing\nitself in prophecy and warning; origin in automatic utterance\ngenerally,\u2014these origins have been stock warrants for the truth of one\nopinion after another which we find represented in religious history. The\nmedical materialists are therefore only so many belated dogmatists, neatly\nturning the tables on their predecessors by using the criterion of origin\nin a destructive instead of an accreditive way.\nThey are effective with their talk of pathological origin only so long as\nsupernatural origin is pleaded by the other side, and nothing but the\nargument from origin is under discussion. But the argument from origin has\nseldom been used alone, for it is too obviously insufficient. Dr. Maudsley\nis perhaps the cleverest of the rebutters of supernatural religion on\ngrounds of origin. Yet he finds himself forced to write:\u2014\n\u201cWhat right have we to believe Nature under any obligation to do her work\nby means of complete minds only? She may find an incomplete mind a more\nsuitable instrument for a particular purpose. It is the work that is done,\nand the quality in the worker by which it was done, that is alone of\nmoment; and it may be no great matter from a cosmical standpoint, if in\nother qualities of character he was singularly defective\u2014if indeed he were\nhypocrite, adulterer, eccentric, or lunatic.... Home we come again, then,\nto the old and last resort of certitude,\u2014namely the common assent of\nmankind, or of the competent by instruction and training among\nmankind.\u201d(5)\nIn other words, not its origin, but _the way in which it works on the\nwhole_, is Dr. Maudsley\u2019s final test of a belief. This is our own\nempiricist criterion; and this criterion the stoutest insisters on\nsupernatural origin have also been forced to use in the end. Among the\nvisions and messages some have always been too patently silly, among the\ntrances and convulsive seizures some have been too fruitless for conduct\nand character, to pass themselves off as significant, still less as\ndivine. In the history of Christian mysticism the problem how to\ndiscriminate between such messages and experiences as were really divine\nmiracles, and such others as the demon in his malice was able to\ncounterfeit, thus making the religious person twofold more the child of\nhell he was before, has always been a difficult one to solve, needing all\nthe sagacity and experience of the best directors of conscience. In the\nend it had to come to our empiricist criterion: By their fruits ye shall\nknow them, not by their roots, Jonathan Edwards\u2019s Treatise on Religious\nAffections is an elaborate working out of this thesis. The _roots_ of a\nman\u2019s virtue are inaccessible to us. No appearances whatever are\ninfallible proofs of grace. Our practice is the only sure evidence, even\nto ourselves, that we are genuinely Christians.\n\u201cIn forming a judgment of ourselves now,\u201d Edwards writes, \u201cwe\nshould certainly adopt that evidence which our supreme Judge will\nchiefly make use of when we come to stand before him at the last\nday.... There is not one grace of the Spirit of God, of the\nexistence of which, in any professor of religion, Christian\npractice is not the most decisive evidence.... The degree in which\nour experience is productive of practice shows the degree in which\nour experience is spiritual and divine.\u201d\nCatholic writers are equally emphatic. The good dispositions which a\nvision, or voice, or other apparent heavenly favor leave behind them are\nthe only marks by which we may be sure they are not possible deceptions of\nthe tempter. Says Saint Teresa:\u2014\n\u201cLike imperfect sleep which, instead of giving more strength to\nthe head, doth but leave it the more exhausted, the result of mere\noperations of the imagination is but to weaken the soul. Instead\nof nourishment and energy she reaps only lassitude and disgust:\nwhereas a genuine heavenly vision yields to her a harvest of\nineffable spiritual riches, and an admirable renewal of bodily\nstrength. I alleged these reasons to those who so often accused my\nvisions of being the work of the enemy of mankind and the sport of\nmy imagination.... I showed them the jewels which the divine hand\nhad left with me:\u2014they were my actual dispositions. All those who\nknew me saw that I was changed; my confessor bore witness to the\nfact; this improvement, palpable in all respects, far from being\nhidden, was brilliantly evident to all men. As for myself, it was\nimpossible to believe that if the demon were its author, he could\nhave used, in order to lose me and lead me to hell, an expedient\nso contrary to his own interests as that of uprooting my vices,\nand filling me with masculine courage and other virtues instead,\nfor I saw clearly that a single one of these visions was enough to\nenrich me with all that wealth.\u201d(6)\nI fear I may have made a longer excursus than was necessary, and that\nfewer words would have dispelled the uneasiness which may have arisen\namong some of you as I announced my pathological programme. At any rate\nyou must all be ready now to judge the religious life by its results\nexclusively, and I shall assume that the bugaboo of morbid origin will\nscandalize your piety no more.\nStill, you may ask me, if its results are to be the ground of our final\nspiritual estimate of a religious phenomenon, why threaten us at all with\nso much existential study of its conditions? Why not simply leave\npathological questions out?\nTo this I reply in two ways: First, I say, irrepressible curiosity\nimperiously leads one on; and I say, secondly, that it always leads to a\nbetter understanding of a thing\u2019s significance to consider its\nexaggerations and perversions, its equivalents and substitutes and nearest\nrelatives elsewhere. Not that we may thereby swamp the thing in the\nwholesale condemnation which we pass on its inferior congeners, but rather\nthat we may by contrast ascertain the more precisely in what its merits\nconsist, by learning at the same time to what particular dangers of\ncorruption it may also be exposed.\nInsane conditions have this advantage, that they isolate special factors\nof the mental life, and enable us to inspect them unmasked by their more\nusual surroundings. They play the part in mental anatomy which the scalpel\nand the microscope play in the anatomy of the body. To understand a thing\nrightly we need to see it both out of its environment and in it, and to\nhave acquaintance with the whole range of its variations. The study of\nhallucinations has in this way been for psychologists the key to their\ncomprehension of normal sensation, that of illusions has been the key to\nthe right comprehension of perception. Morbid impulses and imperative\nconceptions, \u201cfixed ideas,\u201d so called, have thrown a flood of light on the\npsychology of the normal will; and obsessions and delusions have performed\nthe same service for that of the normal faculty of belief.\nSimilarly, the nature of genius has been illuminated by the attempts, of\nwhich I already made mention, to class it with psychopathical phenomena.\nBorderland insanity, crankiness, insane temperament, loss of mental\nbalance, psychopathic degeneration (to use a few of the many synonyms by\nwhich it has been called), has certain peculiarities and liabilities\nwhich, when combined with a superior quality of intellect in an\nindividual, make it more probable that he will make his mark and affect\nhis age, than if his temperament were less neurotic. There is of course no\nspecial affinity between crankiness as such and superior intellect,(7) for\nmost psychopaths have feeble intellects, and superior intellects more\ncommonly have normal nervous systems. But the psychopathic temperament,\nwhatever be the intellect with which it finds itself paired, often brings\nwith it ardor and excitability of character. The cranky person has\nextraordinary emotional susceptibility. He is liable to fixed ideas and\nobsessions. His conceptions tend to pass immediately into belief and\naction; and when he gets a new idea, he has no rest till he proclaims it,\nor in some way \u201cworks it off.\u201d \u201cWhat shall I think of it?\u201d a common person\nsays to himself about a vexed question; but in a \u201ccranky\u201d mind \u201cWhat must\nI do about it?\u201d is the form the question tends to take. In the\nautobiography of that high\u2010souled woman, Mrs. Annie Besant, I read the\nfollowing passage: \u201cPlenty of people wish well to any good cause, but very\nfew care to exert themselves to help it, and still fewer will risk\nanything in its support. \u2018Some one ought to do it, but why should I?\u2019 is\nthe ever re\u00ebchoed phrase of weak\u2010kneed amiability. \u2018Some one ought to do\nit, so why not I?\u2019 is the cry of some earnest servant of man, eagerly\nforward springing to face some perilous duty. Between these two sentences\nlie whole centuries of moral evolution.\u201d True enough! and between these\ntwo sentences lie also the different destinies of the ordinary sluggard\nand the psychopathic man. Thus, when a superior intellect and a\npsychopathic temperament coalesce\u2014as in the endless permutations and\ncombinations of human faculty, they are bound to coalesce often enough\u2014in\nthe same individual, we have the best possible condition for the kind of\neffective genius that gets into the biographical dictionaries. Such men do\nnot remain mere critics and understanders with their intellect. Their\nideas possess them, they inflict them, for better or worse, upon their\ncompanions or their age. It is they who get counted when Messrs Lombroso,\nNisbet, and others invoke statistics to defend their paradox.\nTo pass now to religious phenomena, take the melancholy which, as we shall\nsee, constitutes an essential moment in every complete religious\nevolution. Take the happiness which achieved religious belief confers.\nTake the trance\u2010like states of insight into truth which all religious\nmystics report.(8) These are each and all of them special cases of kinds\nof human experience of much wider scope. Religious melancholy, whatever\npeculiarities it may have _qu\u00e2_ religious, is at any rate melancholy.\nReligious happiness is happiness. Religious trance is trance. And the\nmoment we renounce the absurd notion that a thing is exploded away as soon\nas it is classed with others, or its origin is shown; the moment we agree\nto stand by experimental results and inner quality, in judging of\nvalues,\u2014who does not see that we are likely to ascertain the distinctive\nsignificance of religious melancholy and happiness, or of religious\ntrances, far better by comparing them as conscientiously as we can with\nother varieties of melancholy, happiness, and trance, than by refusing to\nconsider their place in any more general series, and treating them as if\nthey were outside of nature\u2019s order altogether?\nI hope that the course of these lectures will confirm us in this\nsupposition. As regards the psychopathic origin of so many religious\nphenomena, that would not be in the least surprising or disconcerting,\neven were such phenomena certified from on high to be the most precious of\nhuman experiences. No one organism can possibly yield to its owner the\nwhole body of truth. Few of us are not in some way infirm, or even\ndiseased; and our very infirmities help us unexpectedly. In the\npsychopathic temperament we have the emotionality which is the _sine qu\u00e2\nnon_ of moral perception; we have the intensity and tendency to emphasis\nwhich are the essence of practical moral vigor; and we have the love of\nmetaphysics and mysticism which carry one\u2019s interests beyond the surface\nof the sensible world. What, then, is more natural than that this\ntemperament should introduce one to regions of religious truth, to corners\nof the universe, which your robust Philistine type of nervous system,\nforever offering its biceps to be felt, thumping its breast, and thanking\nHeaven that it hasn\u2019t a single morbid fibre in its composition, would be\nsure to hide forever from its self\u2010satisfied possessors?\nIf there were such a thing as inspiration from a higher realm, it might\nwell be that the neurotic temperament would furnish the chief condition of\nthe requisite receptivity. And having said thus much, I think that I may\nlet the matter of religion and neuroticism drop.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe mass of collateral phenomena, morbid or healthy, with which the\nvarious religious phenomena must be compared in order to understand them\nbetter, forms what in the slang of pedagogics is termed \u201cthe apperceiving\nmass\u201d by which we comprehend them. The only novelty that I can imagine\nthis course of lectures to possess lies in the breadth of the apperceiving\nmass. I may succeed in discussing religious experiences in a wider context\nthan has been usual in university courses.\nLECTURE II. CIRCUMSCRIPTION OF THE TOPIC.\nMost books on the philosophy of religion try to begin with a precise\ndefinition of what its essence consists of. Some of these would\u2010be\ndefinitions may possibly come before us in later portions of this course,\nand I shall not be pedantic enough to enumerate any of them to you now.\nMeanwhile the very fact that they are so many and so different from one\nanother is enough to prove that the word \u201creligion\u201d cannot stand for any\nsingle principle or essence, but is rather a collective name. The\ntheorizing mind tends always to the over\u2010simplification of its materials.\nThis is the root of all that absolutism and one\u2010sided dogmatism by which\nboth philosophy and religion have been infested. Let us not fall\nimmediately into a one\u2010sided view of our subject, but let us rather admit\nfreely at the outset that we may very likely find no one essence, but many\ncharacters which may alternately be equally important in religion. If we\nshould inquire for the essence of \u201cgovernment,\u201d for example, one man might\ntell us it was authority, another submission, another police, another an\narmy, another an assembly, another a system of laws; yet all the while it\nwould be true that no concrete government can exist without all these\nthings, one of which is more important at one moment and others at\nanother. The man who knows governments most completely is he who troubles\nhimself least about a definition which shall give their essence. Enjoying\nan intimate acquaintance with all their particularities in turn, he would\nnaturally regard an abstract conception in which these were unified as a\nthing more misleading than enlightening. And why may not religion be a\nconception equally complex?(9)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nConsider also the \u201creligious sentiment\u201d which we see referred to in so\nmany books, as if it were a single sort of mental entity.\nIn the psychologies and in the philosophies of religion, we find the\nauthors attempting to specify just what entity it is. One man allies it to\nthe feeling of dependence; one makes it a derivative from fear; others\nconnect it with the sexual life; others still identify it with the feeling\nof the infinite; and so on. Such different ways of conceiving it ought of\nthemselves to arouse doubt as to whether it possibly can be one specific\nthing; and the moment we are willing to treat the term \u201creligious\nsentiment\u201d as a collective name for the many sentiments which religious\nobjects may arouse in alternation, we see that it probably contains\nnothing whatever of a psychologically specific nature. There is religious\nfear, religious love, religious awe, religious joy, and so forth. But\nreligious love is only man\u2019s natural emotion of love directed to a\nreligious object; religious fear is only the ordinary fear of commerce, so\nto speak, the common quaking of the human breast, in so far as the notion\nof divine retribution may arouse it; religious awe is the same organic\nthrill which we feel in a forest at twilight, or in a mountain gorge; only\nthis time it comes over us at the thought of our supernatural relations;\nand similarly of all the various sentiments which may be called into play\nin the lives of religious persons. As concrete states of mind, made up of\na feeling _plus_ a specific sort of object, religious emotions of course\nare psychic entities distinguishable from other concrete emotions; but\nthere is no ground for assuming a simple abstract \u201creligious emotion\u201d to\nexist as a distinct elementary mental affection by itself, present in\nevery religious experience without exception.\nAs there thus seems to be no one elementary religious emotion, but only a\ncommon storehouse of emotions upon which religious objects may draw, so\nthere might conceivably also prove to be no one specific and essential\nkind of religious object, and no one specific and essential kind of\nreligious act.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe field of religion being as wide as this, it is manifestly impossible\nthat I should pretend to cover it. My lectures must be limited to a\nfraction of the subject. And, although it would indeed be foolish to set\nup an abstract definition of religion\u2019s essence, and then proceed to\ndefend that definition against all comers, yet this need not prevent me\nfrom taking my own narrow view of what religion shall consist in _for the\npurpose of these lectures_, or, out of the many meanings of the word, from\nchoosing the one meaning in which I wish to interest you particularly, and\nproclaiming arbitrarily that when I say \u201creligion\u201d I mean _that_. This, in\nfact, is what I must do, and I will now preliminarily seek to mark out the\nfield I choose.\nOne way to mark it out easily is to say what aspects of the subject we\nleave out. At the outset we are struck by one great partition which\ndivides the religious field. On the one side of it lies institutional, on\nthe other personal religion. As M. P. Sabatier says, one branch of\nreligion keeps the divinity, another keeps man most in view. Worship and\nsacrifice, procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity,\ntheology and ceremony and ecclesiastical organization, are the essentials\nof religion in the institutional branch. Were we to limit our view to it,\nwe should have to define religion as an external art, the art of winning\nthe favor of the gods. In the more personal branch of religion it is on\nthe contrary the inner dispositions of man himself which form the centre\nof interest, his conscience, his deserts, his helplessness, his\nincompleteness. And although the favor of the God, as forfeited or gained,\nis still an essential feature of the story, and theology plays a vital\npart therein, yet the acts to which this sort of religion prompts are\npersonal not ritual acts, the individual transacts the business by himself\nalone, and the ecclesiastical organization, with its priests and\nsacraments and other go\u2010betweens, sinks to an altogether secondary place.\nThe relation goes direct from heart to heart, from soul to soul, between\nman and his maker.\nNow in these lectures I propose to ignore the institutional branch\nentirely, to say nothing of the ecclesiastical organization, to consider\nas little as possible the systematic theology and the ideas about the gods\nthemselves, and to confine myself as far as I can to personal religion\npure and simple. To some of you personal religion, thus nakedly\nconsidered, will no doubt seem too incomplete a thing to wear the general\nname. \u201cIt is a part of religion,\u201d you will say, \u201cbut only its unorganized\nrudiment; if we are to name it by itself, we had better call it man\u2019s\nconscience or morality than his religion. The name \u2018religion\u2019 should be\nreserved for the fully organized system of feeling, thought, and\ninstitution, for the Church, in short, of which this personal religion, so\ncalled, is but a fractional element.\u201d\nBut if you say this, it will only show the more plainly how much the\nquestion of definition tends to become a dispute about names. Rather than\nprolong such a dispute, I am willing to accept almost any name for the\npersonal religion of which I propose to treat. Call it conscience or\nmorality, if you yourselves prefer, and not religion\u2014under either name it\nwill be equally worthy of our study. As for myself, I think it will prove\nto contain some elements which morality pure and simple does not contain,\nand these elements I shall soon seek to point out; so I will myself\ncontinue to apply the word \u201creligion\u201d to it; and in the last lecture of\nall, I will bring in the theologies and the ecclesiasticisms, and say\nsomething of its relation to them.\nIn one sense at least the personal religion will prove itself more\nfundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism. Churches, when once\nestablished, live at second\u2010hand upon tradition; but the _founders_ of\nevery church owed their power originally to the fact of their direct\npersonal communion with the divine. Not only the superhuman founders, the\nChrist, the Buddha, Mahomet, but all the originators of Christian sects\nhave been in this case;\u2014so personal religion should still seem the\nprimordial thing, even to those who continue to esteem it incomplete.\nThere are, it is true, other things in religion chronologically more\nprimordial than personal devoutness in the moral sense. Fetishism and\nmagic seem to have preceded inward piety historically\u2014at least our records\nof inward piety do not reach back so far. And if fetishism and magic be\nregarded as stages of religion, one may say that personal religion in the\ninward sense and the genuinely spiritual ecclesiasticisms which it founds\nare phenomena of secondary or even tertiary order. But, quite apart from\nthe fact that many anthropologists\u2014for instance, Jevons and\nFrazer\u2014expressly oppose \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmagic\u201d to each other, it is\ncertain that the whole system of thought which leads to magic, fetishism,\nand the lower superstitions may just as well be called primitive science\nas called primitive religion. The question thus becomes a verbal one\nagain; and our knowledge of all these early stages of thought and feeling\nis in any case so conjectural and imperfect that farther discussion would\nnot be worth while.\nReligion, therefore, as I now ask you arbitrarily to take it, shall mean\nfor us _the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their\nsolitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to\nwhatever they may consider the divine_. Since the relation may be either\nmoral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in the\nsense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical\norganizations may secondarily grow. In these lectures, however, as I have\nalready said, the immediate personal experiences will amply fill our time,\nand we shall hardly consider theology or ecclesiasticism at all.\nWe escape much controversial matter by this arbitrary definition of our\nfield. But, still, a chance of controversy comes up over the word \u201cdivine\u201d\nif we take it in the definition in too narrow a sense. There are systems\nof thought which the world usually calls religious, and yet which do not\npositively assume a God. Buddhism is in this case. Popularly, of course,\nthe Buddha himself stands in place of a God; but in strictness the\nBuddhistic system is atheistic. Modern transcendental idealism,\nEmersonianism, for instance, also seems to let God evaporate into abstract\nIdeality. Not a deity _in concreto_, not a superhuman person, but the\nimmanent divinity in things, the essentially spiritual structure of the\nuniverse, is the object of the transcendentalist cult. In that address to\nthe graduating class at Divinity College in 1838 which made Emerson\nfamous, the frank expression of this worship of mere abstract laws was\nwhat made the scandal of the performance.\n\u201cThese laws,\u201d said the speaker, \u201cexecute themselves. They are out\nof time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance: Thus, in\nthe soul of man there is a justice whose retributions are instant\nand entire. He who does a good deed is instantly ennobled. He who\ndoes a mean deed is by the action itself contracted. He who puts\noff impurity thereby puts on purity. If a man is at heart just,\nthen in so far is he God; the safety of God, the immortality of\nGod, the majesty of God, do enter into that man with justice. If a\nman dissemble, deceive, he deceives himself, and goes out of\nacquaintance with his own being. Character is always known. Thefts\nnever enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of\nstone walls. The least admixture of a lie\u2014for example, the taint\nof vanity, any attempt to make a good impression, a favorable\nappearance\u2014will instantly vitiate the effect. But speak the truth,\nand all things alive or brute are vouchers, and the very roots of\nthe grass underground there do seem to stir and move to bear your\nwitness. For all things proceed out of the same spirit, which is\ndifferently named love, justice, temperance, in its different\napplications, just as the ocean receives different names on the\nseveral shores which it washes. In so far as he roves from these\nends, a man bereaves himself of power, of auxiliaries. His being\nshrinks ... he becomes less and less, a mote, a point, until\nabsolute badness is absolute death. The perception of this law\nawakens in the mind a sentiment which we call the religious\nsentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its\npower to charm and to command. It is a mountain air. It is the\nembalmer of the world. It makes the sky and the hills sublime, and\nthe silent song of the stars is it. It is the beatitude of man. It\nmakes him illimitable. When he says \u2018I ought\u2019; when love warns\nhim; when he chooses, warned from on high, the good and great\ndeed; then, deep melodies wander through his soul from supreme\nwisdom. Then he can worship, and be enlarged by his worship; for\nhe can never go behind this sentiment. All the expressions of this\nsentiment are sacred and permanent in proportion to their purity.\n[They] affect us more than all other compositions. The sentences\nof the olden time, which ejaculate this piety, are still fresh and\nfragrant. And the unique impression of Jesus upon mankind, whose\nname is not so much written as ploughed into the history of this\nworld, is proof of the subtle virtue of this infusion.\u201d(10)\nSuch is the Emersonian religion. The universe has a divine soul of order,\nwhich soul is moral, being also the soul within the soul of man. But\nwhether this soul of the universe be a mere quality like the eye\u2019s\nbrilliancy or the skin\u2019s softness, or whether it be a self\u2010conscious life\nlike the eye\u2019s seeing or the skin\u2019s feeling, is a decision that never\nunmistakably appears in Emerson\u2019s pages. It quivers on the boundary of\nthese things, sometimes leaning one way, sometimes the other, to suit the\nliterary rather than the philosophic need. Whatever it is, though, it is\nactive. As much as if it were a God, we can trust it to protect all ideal\ninterests and keep the world\u2019s balance straight. The sentences in which\nEmerson, to the very end, gave utterance to this faith are as fine as\nanything in literature: \u201cIf you love and serve men, you cannot by any\nhiding or stratagem escape the remuneration. Secret retributions are\nalways restoring the level, when disturbed, of the divine justice. It is\nimpossible to tilt the beam. All the tyrants and proprietors and\nmonopolists of the world in vain set their shoulders to heave the bar.\nSettles forevermore the ponderous equator to its line, and man and mote,\nand star and sun, must range to it, or be pulverized by the recoil.\u201d(11)\nNow it would be too absurd to say that the inner experiences that underlie\nsuch expressions of faith as this and impel the writer to their utterance\nare quite unworthy to be called religious experiences. The sort of appeal\nthat Emersonian optimism, on the one hand, and Buddhistic pessimism, on\nthe other, make to the individual and the sort of response which he makes\nto them in his life are in fact indistinguishable from, and in many\nrespects identical with, the best Christian appeal and response. We must\ntherefore, from the experiential point of view, call these godless or\nquasi\u2010godless creeds \u201creligions\u201d; and accordingly when in our definition\nof religion we speak of the individual\u2019s relation to \u201cwhat he considers\nthe divine,\u201d we must interpret the term \u201cdivine\u201d very broadly, as denoting\nany object that is god_like_, whether it be a concrete deity or not.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut the term \u201cgodlike,\u201d if thus treated as a floating general quality,\nbecomes exceedingly vague, for many gods have flourished in religious\nhistory, and their attributes have been discrepant enough. What then is\nthat essentially godlike quality\u2014be it embodied in a concrete deity or\nnot\u2014our relation to which determines our character as religious men? It\nwill repay us to seek some answer to this question before we proceed\nfarther.\nFor one thing, gods are conceived to be first things in the way of being\nand power. They overarch and envelop, and from them there is no escape.\nWhat relates to them is the first and last word in the way of truth.\nWhatever then were most primal and enveloping and deeply true might at\nthis rate be treated as godlike, and a man\u2019s religion might thus be\nidentified with his attitude, whatever it might be, towards what he felt\nto be the primal truth.\nSuch a definition as this would in a way be defensible. Religion, whatever\nit is, is a man\u2019s total reaction upon life, so why not say that any total\nreaction upon life is a religion? Total reactions are different from\ncasual reactions, and total attitudes are different from usual or\nprofessional attitudes. To get at them you must go behind the foreground\nof existence and reach down to that curious sense of the whole residual\ncosmos as an everlasting presence, intimate or alien, terrible or amusing,\nlovable or odious, which in some degree every one possesses. This sense of\nthe world\u2019s presence, appealing as it does to our peculiar individual\ntemperament, makes us either strenuous or careless, devout or blasphemous,\ngloomy or exultant, about life at large; and our reaction, involuntary and\ninarticulate and often half unconscious as it is, is the completest of all\nour answers to the question, \u201cWhat is the character of this universe in\nwhich we dwell?\u201d It expresses our individual sense of it in the most\ndefinite way. Why then not call these reactions our religion, no matter\nwhat specific character they may have? Non\u2010religious as some of these\nreactions may be, in one sense of the word \u201creligious,\u201d they yet belong to\n_the general sphere of the religious life_, and so should generically be\nclassed as religious reactions. \u201cHe believes in No\u2010God, and he worships\nhim,\u201d said a colleague of mine of a student who was manifesting a fine\natheistic ardor; and the more fervent opponents of Christian doctrine have\noften enough shown a temper which, psychologically considered, is\nindistinguishable from religious zeal.\nBut so very broad a use of the word \u201creligion\u201d would be inconvenient,\nhowever defensible it might remain on logical grounds. There are trifling,\nsneering attitudes even towards the whole of life; and in some men these\nattitudes are final and systematic. It would strain the ordinary use of\nlanguage too much to call such attitudes religious, even though, from the\npoint of view of an unbiased critical philosophy, they might conceivably\nbe perfectly reasonable ways of looking upon life. Voltaire, for example,\nwrites thus to a friend, at the age of seventy\u2010three: \u201cAs for myself,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cweak as I am, I carry on the war to the last moment, I get a\nhundred pike\u2010thrusts, I return two hundred, and I laugh. I see near my\ndoor Geneva on fire with quarrels over nothing, and I laugh again; and,\nthank God, I can look upon the world as a farce even when it becomes as\ntragic as it sometimes does. All comes out even at the end of the day, and\nall comes out still more even when all the days are over.\u201d\nMuch as we may admire such a robust old gamecock spirit in a\nvaletudinarian, to call it a religious spirit would be odd. Yet it is for\nthe moment Voltaire\u2019s reaction on the whole of life. _Je m\u2019en fiche_ is\nthe vulgar French equivalent for our English ejaculation \u201cWho cares?\u201d And\nthe happy term _je m\u2019en fichisme_ recently has been invented to designate\nthe systematic determination not to take anything in life too solemnly.\n\u201cAll is vanity\u201d is the relieving word in all difficult crises for this\nmode of thought, which that exquisite literary genius Renan took pleasure,\nin his later days of sweet decay, in putting into coquettishly\nsacrilegious forms which remain to us as excellent expressions of the \u201call\nis vanity\u201d state of mind. Take the following passage, for example,\u2014we must\nhold to duty, even against the evidence, Renan says,\u2014but he then goes on:\u2014\n\u201cThere are many chances that the world may be nothing but a fairy\npantomime of which no God has care. We must therefore arrange\nourselves so that on neither hypothesis we shall be completely\nwrong. We must listen to the superior voices, but in such a way\nthat if the second hypothesis were true we should not have been\ntoo completely duped. If in effect the world be not a serious\nthing, it is the dogmatic people who will be the shallow ones, and\nthe worldly minded whom the theologians now call frivolous will be\nthose who are really wise.\n\u201c_In utrumque paratus_, then. Be ready for anything\u2014that perhaps\nis wisdom. Give ourselves up, according to the hour, to\nconfidence, to skepticism, to optimism, to irony, and we may be\nsure that at certain moments at least we shall be with the\ntruth.... Good\u2010humor is a philosophic state of mind; it seems to\nsay to Nature that we take her no more seriously than she takes\nus. I maintain that one should always talk of philosophy with a\nsmile. We owe it to the Eternal to be virtuous; but we have the\nright to add to this tribute our irony as a sort of personal\nreprisal. In this way we return to the right quarter jest for\njest; we play the trick that has been played on us. Saint\nAugustine\u2019s phrase: _Lord, if we are deceived, it is by thee!_\nremains a fine one, well suited to our modern feeling. Only we\nwish the Eternal to know that if we accept the fraud, we accept it\nknowingly and willingly. We are resigned in advance to losing the\ninterest on our investments of virtue, but we wish not to appear\nridiculous by having counted on them too securely.\u201d(12)\nSurely all the usual associations of the word \u201creligion\u201d would have to be\nstripped away if such a systematic _parti pris_ of irony were also to be\ndenoted by the name. For common men \u201creligion,\u201d whatever more special\nmeanings it may have, signifies always a _serious_ state of mind. If any\none phrase could gather its universal message, that phrase would be, \u201cAll\nis _not_ vanity in this Universe, whatever the appearances may suggest.\u201d\nIf it can stop anything, religion as commonly apprehended can stop just\nsuch chaffing talk as Renan\u2019s. It favors gravity, not pertness; it says\n\u201chush\u201d to all vain chatter and smart wit.\nBut if hostile to light irony, religion is equally hostile to heavy\ngrumbling and complaint. The world appears tragic enough in some\nreligions, but the tragedy is realized as purging, and a way of\ndeliverance is held to exist. We shall see enough of the religious\nmelancholy in a future lecture; but melancholy, according to our ordinary\nuse of language, forfeits all title to be called religious when, in Marcus\nAurelius\u2019s racy words, the sufferer simply lies kicking and screaming\nafter the fashion of a sacrificed pig. The mood of a Schopenhauer or a\nNietzsche,\u2014and in a less degree one may sometimes say the same of our own\nsad Carlyle,\u2014though often an ennobling sadness, is almost as often only\npeevishness running away with the bit between its teeth. The sallies of\nthe two German authors remind one, half the time, of the sick shriekings\nof two dying rats. They lack the purgatorial note which religious sadness\ngives forth.\nThere must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude\nwhich we denominate religious. If glad, it must not grin or snicker; if\nsad, it must not scream or curse. It is precisely as being _solemn_\nexperiences that I wish to interest you in religious experiences. So I\npropose\u2014arbitrarily again, if you please\u2014to narrow our definition once\nmore by saying that the word \u201cdivine,\u201d as employed therein, shall mean for\nus not merely the primal and enveloping and real, for that meaning if\ntaken without restriction might well prove too broad. The divine shall\nmean for us only such a primal reality as the individual feels impelled to\nrespond to solemnly and gravely, and neither by a curse nor a jest.\nBut solemnity, and gravity, and all such emotional attributes, admit of\nvarious shades; and, do what we will with our defining, the truth must at\nlast be confronted that we are dealing with a field of experience where\nthere is not a single conception that can be sharply drawn. The\npretension, under such conditions, to be rigorously \u201cscientific\u201d or\n\u201cexact\u201d in our terms would only stamp us as lacking in understanding of\nour task. Things are more or less divine, states of mind are more or less\nreligious, reactions are more or less total, but the boundaries are always\nmisty, and it is everywhere a question of amount and degree. Nevertheless,\nat their extreme of development, there can never be any question as to\nwhat experiences are religious. The divinity of the object and the\nsolemnity of the reaction are too well marked for doubt. Hesitation as to\nwhether a state of mind is \u201creligious,\u201d or \u201cirreligious,\u201d or \u201cmoral,\u201d or\n\u201cphilosophical,\u201d is only likely to arise when the state of mind is weakly\ncharacterized, but in that case it will be hardly worthy of our study at\nall. With states that can only by courtesy be called religious we need\nhave nothing to do, our only profitable business being with what nobody\ncan possibly feel tempted to call anything else. I said in my former\nlecture that we learn most about a thing when we view it under a\nmicroscope, as it were, or in its most exaggerated form. This is as true\nof religious phenomena as of any other kind of fact. The only cases likely\nto be profitable enough to repay our attention will therefore be cases\nwhere the religious spirit is unmistakable and extreme. Its fainter\nmanifestations we may tranquilly pass by. Here, for example, is the total\nreaction upon life of Frederick Locker Lampson, whose autobiography,\nentitled \u201cConfidences,\u201d proves him to have been a most amiable man.\n\u201cI am so far resigned to my lot that I feel small pain at the\nthought of having to part from what has been called the pleasant\nhabit of existence, the sweet fable of life. I would not care to\nlive my wasted life over again, and so to prolong my span. Strange\nto say, I have but little wish to be younger. I submit with a\nchill at my heart. I humbly submit because it is the Divine Will,\nand my appointed destiny. I dread the increase of infirmities that\nwill make me a burden to those around me, those dear to me. No!\nlet me slip away as quietly and comfortably as I can. Let the end\ncome, if peace come with it.\n\u201cI do not know that there is a great deal to be said for this\nworld, or our sojourn here upon it; but it has pleased God so to\nplace us, and it must please me also. I ask you, what is human\nlife? Is not it a maimed happiness\u2014care and weariness, weariness\nand care, with the baseless expectation, the strange cozenage of a\nbrighter to\u2010morrow? At best it is but a froward child, that must\nbe played with and humored, to keep it quiet till it falls asleep,\nand then the care is over.\u201d(13)\nThis is a complex, a tender, a submissive, and a graceful state of mind.\nFor myself, I should have no objection to calling it on the whole a\nreligious state of mind, although I dare say that to many of you it may\nseem too listless and half\u2010hearted to merit so good a name. But what\nmatters it in the end whether we call such a state of mind religious or\nnot? It is too insignificant for our instruction in any case; and its very\npossessor wrote it down in terms which he would not have used unless he\nhad been thinking of more energetically religious moods in others, with\nwhich he found himself unable to compete. It is with these more energetic\nstates that our sole business lies, and we can perfectly well afford to\nlet the minor notes and the uncertain border go.\nIt was the extremer cases that I had in mind a little while ago when I\nsaid that personal religion, even without theology or ritual, would prove\nto embody some elements that morality pure and simple does not contain.\nYou may remember that I promised shortly to point out what those elements\nwere. In a general way I can now say what I had in mind.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\n\u201cI accept the universe\u201d is reported to have been a favorite utterance of\nour New England transcendentalist, Margaret Fuller; and when some one\nrepeated this phrase to Thomas Carlyle, his sardonic comment is said to\nhave been: \u201cGad! she\u2019d better!\u201d At bottom the whole concern of both\nmorality and religion is with the manner of our acceptance of the\nuniverse. Do we accept it only in part and grudgingly, or heartily and\naltogether? Shall our protests against certain things in it be radical and\nunforgiving, or shall we think that, even with evil, there are ways of\nliving that must lead to good? If we accept the whole, shall we do so as\nif stunned into submission,\u2014as Carlyle would have us\u2014\u201cGad! we\u2019d\nbetter!\u201d\u2014or shall we do so with enthusiastic assent? Morality pure and\nsimple accepts the law of the whole which it finds reigning, so far as to\nacknowledge and obey it, but it may obey it with the heaviest and coldest\nheart, and never cease to feel it as a yoke. But for religion, in its\nstrong and fully developed manifestations, the service of the highest\nnever is felt as a yoke. Dull submission is left far behind, and a mood of\nwelcome, which may fill any place on the scale between cheerful serenity\nand enthusiastic gladness, has taken its place.\nIt makes a tremendous emotional and practical difference to one whether\none accept the universe in the drab discolored way of stoic resignation to\nnecessity, or with the passionate happiness of Christian saints. The\ndifference is as great as that between passivity and activity, as that\nbetween the defensive and the aggressive mood. Gradual as are the steps by\nwhich an individual may grow from one state into the other, many as are\nthe intermediate stages which different individuals represent, yet when\nyou place the typical extremes beside each other for comparison, you feel\nthat two discontinuous psychological universes confront you, and that in\npassing from one to the other a \u201ccritical point\u201d has been overcome.\nIf we compare stoic with Christian ejaculations we see much more than a\ndifference of doctrine; rather is it a difference of emotional mood that\nparts them. When Marcus Aurelius reflects on the eternal reason that has\nordered things, there is a frosty chill about his words which you rarely\nfind in a Jewish, and never in a Christian piece of religious writing. The\nuniverse is \u201caccepted\u201d by all these writers; but how devoid of passion or\nexultation the spirit of the Roman Emperor is! Compare his fine sentence:\n\u201cIf gods care not for me or my children, here is a reason for it,\u201d with\nJob\u2019s cry: \u201cThough he slay me, yet will I trust in him!\u201d and you\nimmediately see the difference I mean. The _anima mundi_, to whose\ndisposal of his own personal destiny the Stoic consents, is there to be\nrespected and submitted to, but the Christian God is there to be loved;\nand the difference of emotional atmosphere is like that between an arctic\nclimate and the tropics, though the outcome in the way of accepting actual\nconditions uncomplainingly may seem in abstract terms to be much the same.\n\u201cIt is a man\u2019s duty,\u201d says Marcus Aurelius, \u201cto comfort himself\nand wait for the natural dissolution, and not to be vexed, but to\nfind refreshment solely in these thoughts\u2014first that nothing will\nhappen to me which is not conformable to the nature of the\nuniverse; and secondly that I need do nothing contrary to the God\nand deity within me; for there is no man who can compel me to\ntransgress.(14) He is an abscess on the universe who withdraws and\nseparates himself from the reason of our common nature, through\nbeing displeased with the things which happen. For the same nature\nproduces these, and has produced thee too. And so accept\neverything which happens, even if it seem disagreeable, because it\nleads to this, the health of the universe and to the prosperity\nand felicity of Zeus. For he would not have brought on any man\nwhat he has brought, if it were not useful for the whole. The\nintegrity of the whole is mutilated if thou cuttest off anything.\nAnd thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy power, when thou art\ndissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out of the\nway.\u201d(15)\nCompare now this mood with that of the old Christian author of the\nTheologia Germanica:\u2014\n\u201cWhere men are enlightened with the true light, they renounce all\ndesire and choice, and commit and commend themselves and all\nthings to the eternal Goodness, so that every enlightened man\ncould say: \u2018I would fain be to the Eternal Goodness what his own\nhand is to a man.\u2019 Such men are in a state of freedom, because\nthey have lost the fear of pain or hell, and the hope of reward or\nheaven, and are living in pure submission to the eternal Goodness,\nin the perfect freedom of fervent love. When a man truly\nperceiveth and considereth himself, who and what he is, and\nfindeth himself utterly vile and wicked and unworthy, he falleth\ninto such a deep abasement that it seemeth to him reasonable that\nall creatures in heaven and earth should rise up against him. And\ntherefore he will not and dare not desire any consolation and\nrelease; but he is willing to be unconsoled and unreleased; and he\ndoth not grieve over his sufferings, for they are right in his\neyes, and he hath nothing to say against them. This is what is\nmeant by true repentance for sin; and he who in this present time\nentereth into this hell, none may console him. Now God hath not\nforsaken a man in this hell, but He is laying his hand upon him,\nthat the man may not desire nor regard anything but the eternal\nGood only. And then, when the man neither careth for nor desireth\nanything but the eternal Good alone, and seeketh not himself nor\nhis own things, but the honour of God only, he is made a partaker\nof all manner of joy, bliss, peace, rest, and consolation, and so\nthe man is henceforth in the kingdom of heaven. This hell and this\nheaven are two good safe ways for a man, and happy is he who truly\nfindeth them.\u201d(16)\nHow much more active and positive the impulse of the Christian writer to\naccept his place in the universe is! Marcus Aurelius agrees _to_ the\nscheme\u2014the German theologian agrees _with_ it. He literally _abounds_ in\nagreement, he runs out to embrace the divine decrees.\nOccasionally, it is true, the Stoic rises to something like a Christian\nwarmth of sentiment, as in the often quoted passage of Marcus Aurelius:\u2014\n\u201cEverything harmonizes with me which is harmonious to thee, O\nUniverse. Nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in\ndue time for thee. Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons\nbring, O Nature: from thee are all things, in thee are all things,\nto thee all things return. The poet says, Dear City of Cecrops;\nand wilt thou not say, Dear City of Zeus?\u201d(17)\nBut compare even as devout a passage as this with a genuine Christian\noutpouring, and it seems a little cold. Turn, for instance, to the\nImitation of Christ:\u2014\n\u201cLord, thou knowest what is best; let this or that be according as\nthou wilt. Give what thou wilt, so much as thou wilt, when thou\nwilt. Do with me as thou knowest best, and as shall be most to\nthine honour. Place me where thou wilt, and freely work thy will\nwith me in all things.... When could it be evil when thou wert\nnear? I had rather be poor for thy sake than rich without thee. I\nchoose rather to be a pilgrim upon the earth with thee, than\nwithout thee to possess heaven. Where thou art, there is heaven;\nand where thou art not, behold there death and hell.\u201d(18)\nIt is a good rule in physiology, when we are studying the meaning of an\norgan, to ask after its most peculiar and characteristic sort of\nperformance, and to seek its office in that one of its functions which no\nother organ can possibly exert. Surely the same maxim holds good in our\npresent quest. The essence of religious experiences, the thing by which we\nfinally must judge them, must be that element or quality in them which we\ncan meet nowhere else. And such a quality will be of course most prominent\nand easy to notice in those religious experiences which are most one\u2010\nsided, exaggerated, and intense.\nNow when we compare these intenser experiences with the experiences of\ntamer minds, so cool and reasonable that we are tempted to call them\nphilosophical rather than religious, we find a character that is perfectly\ndistinct. That character, it seems to me, should be regarded as the\npractically important _differentia_ of religion for our purpose; and just\nwhat it is can easily be brought out by comparing the mind of an\nabstractly conceived Christian with that of a moralist similarly\nconceived.\nA life is manly, stoical, moral, or philosophical, we say, in proportion\nas it is less swayed by paltry personal considerations and more by\nobjective ends that call for energy, even though that energy bring\npersonal loss and pain. This is the good side of war, in so far as it\ncalls for \u201cvolunteers.\u201d And for morality life is a war, and the service of\nthe highest is a sort of cosmic patriotism which also calls for\nvolunteers. Even a sick man, unable to be militant outwardly, can carry on\nthe moral warfare. He can willfully turn his attention away from his own\nfuture, whether in this world or the next. He can train himself to\nindifference to his present drawbacks and immerse himself in whatever\nobjective interests still remain accessible. He can follow public news,\nand sympathize with other people\u2019s affairs. He can cultivate cheerful\nmanners, and be silent about his miseries. He can contemplate whatever\nideal aspects of existence his philosophy is able to present to him, and\npractice whatever duties, such as patience, resignation, trust, his\nethical system requires. Such a man lives on his loftiest, largest plane.\nHe is a high\u2010hearted freeman and no pining slave. And yet he lacks\nsomething which the Christian _par excellence_, the mystic and ascetic\nsaint, for example, has in abundant measure, and which makes of him a\nhuman being of an altogether different denomination.\nThe Christian also spurns the pinched and mumping sick\u2010room attitude, and\nthe lives of saints are full of a kind of callousness to diseased\nconditions of body which probably no other human records show. But whereas\nthe merely moralistic spurning takes an effort of volition, the Christian\nspurning is the result of the excitement of a higher kind of emotion, in\nthe presence of which no exertion of volition is required. The moralist\nmust hold his breath and keep his muscles tense; and so long as this\nathletic attitude is possible all goes well\u2014morality suffices. But the\nathletic attitude tends ever to break down, and it inevitably does break\ndown even in the most stalwart when the organism begins to decay, or when\nmorbid fears invade the mind. To suggest personal will and effort to one\nall sicklied o\u2019er with the sense of irremediable impotence is to suggest\nthe most impossible of things. What he craves is to be consoled in his\nvery powerlessness, to feel that the spirit of the universe recognizes and\nsecures him, all decaying and failing as he is. Well, we are all such\nhelpless failures in the last resort. The sanest and best of us are of one\nclay with lunatics and prison inmates, and death finally runs the\nrobustest of us down. And whenever we feel this, such a sense of the\nvanity and provisionality of our voluntary career comes over us that all\nour morality appears but as a plaster hiding a sore it can never cure, and\nall our well\u2010doing as the hollowest substitute for that well\u2010_being_ that\nour lives ought to be grounded in, but, alas! are not.\nAnd here religion comes to our rescue and takes our fate into her hands.\nThere is a state of mind, known to religious men, but to no others, in\nwhich the will to assert ourselves and hold our own has been displaced by\na willingness to close our mouths and be as nothing in the floods and\nwaterspouts of God. In this state of mind, what we most dreaded has become\nthe habitation of our safety, and the hour of our moral death has turned\ninto our spiritual birthday. The time for tension in our soul is over, and\nthat of happy relaxation, of calm deep breathing, of an eternal present,\nwith no discordant future to be anxious about, has arrived. Fear is not\nheld in abeyance as it is by mere morality, it is positively expunged and\nwashed away.\nWe shall see abundant examples of this happy state of mind in later\nlectures of this course. We shall see how infinitely passionate a thing\nreligion at its highest flights can be. Like love, like wrath, like hope,\nambition, jealousy, like every other instinctive eagerness and impulse, it\nadds to life an enchantment which is not rationally or logically deducible\nfrom anything else. This enchantment, coming as a gift when it does\ncome,\u2014a gift of our organism, the physiologists will tell us, a gift of\nGod\u2019s grace, the theologians say,\u2014is either there or not there for us, and\nthere are persons who can no more become possessed by it than they can\nfall in love with a given woman by mere word of command. Religious feeling\nis thus an absolute addition to the Subject\u2019s range of life. It gives him\na new sphere of power. When the outward battle is lost, and the outer\nworld disowns him, it redeems and vivifies an interior world which\notherwise would be an empty waste.\nIf religion is to mean anything definite for us, it seems to me that we\nought to take it as meaning this added dimension of emotion, this\nenthusiastic temper of espousal, in regions where morality strictly so\ncalled can at best but bow its head and acquiesce. It ought to mean\nnothing short of this new reach of freedom for us, with the struggle over,\nthe keynote of the universe sounding in our ears, and everlasting\npossession spread before our eyes.(19)\nThis sort of happiness in the absolute and everlasting is what we find\nnowhere but in religion. It is parted off from all mere animal happiness,\nall mere enjoyment of the present, by that element of solemnity of which I\nhave already made so much account. Solemnity is a hard thing to define\nabstractly, but certain of its marks are patent enough. A solemn state of\nmind is never crude or simple\u2014it seems to contain a certain measure of its\nown opposite in solution. A solemn joy preserves a sort of bitter in its\nsweetness; a solemn sorrow is one to which we intimately consent. But\nthere are writers who, realizing that happiness of a supreme sort is the\nprerogative of religion, forget this complication, and call all happiness,\nas such, religious. Mr. Havelock Ellis, for example, identifies religion\nwith the entire field of the soul\u2019s liberation from oppressive moods.\n\u201cThe simplest functions of physiological life,\u201d he writes, \u201cmay be\nits ministers. Every one who is at all acquainted with the Persian\nmystics knows how wine may be regarded as an instrument of\nreligion. Indeed, in all countries and in all ages, some form of\nphysical enlargement\u2014singing, dancing, drinking, sexual\nexcitement\u2014has been intimately associated with worship. Even the\nmomentary expansion of the soul in laughter is, to however slight\nan extent, a religious exercise.... Whenever an impulse from the\nworld strikes against the organism, and the resultant is not\ndiscomfort or pain, not even the muscular contraction of strenuous\nmanhood, but a joyous expansion or aspiration of the whole\nsoul\u2014there is religion. It is the infinite for which we hunger,\nand we ride gladly on every little wave that promises to bear us\ntowards it.\u201d(20)\nBut such a straight identification of religion with any and every form of\nhappiness leaves the essential peculiarity of religious happiness out. The\nmore commonplace happinesses which we get are \u201creliefs,\u201d occasioned by our\nmomentary escapes from evils either experienced or threatened. But in its\nmost characteristic embodiments, religious happiness is no mere feeling of\nescape. It cares no longer to escape. It consents to the evil outwardly as\na form of sacrifice\u2014inwardly it knows it to be permanently overcome. If\nyou ask _how_ religion thus falls on the thorns and faces death, and in\nthe very act annuls annihilation, I cannot explain the matter, for it is\nreligion\u2019s secret, and to understand it you must yourself have been a\nreligious man of the extremer type. In our future examples, even of the\nsimplest and healthiest\u2010minded type of religious consciousness, we shall\nfind this complex sacrificial constitution, in which a higher happiness\nholds a lower unhappiness in check. In the Louvre there is a picture, by\nGuido Reni, of St. Michael with his foot on Satan\u2019s neck. The richness of\nthe picture is in large part due to the fiend\u2019s figure being there. The\nrichness of its allegorical meaning also is due to his being there\u2014that\nis, the world is all the richer for having a devil in it, _so long as we\nkeep our foot upon his neck_. In the religious consciousness, that is just\nthe position in which the fiend, the negative or tragic principle, is\nfound; and for that very reason the religious consciousness is so rich\nfrom the emotional point of view.(21) We shall see how in certain men and\nwomen it takes on a monstrously ascetic form. There are saints who have\nliterally fed on the negative principle, on humiliation and privation, and\nthe thought of suffering and death,\u2014their souls growing in happiness just\nin proportion as their outward state grew more intolerable. No other\nemotion than religious emotion can bring a man to this peculiar pass. And\nit is for that reason that when we ask our question about the value of\nreligion for human life, I think we ought to look for the answer among\nthese violenter examples rather than among those of a more moderate hue.\nHaving the phenomenon of our study in its acutest possible form to start\nwith, we can shade down as much as we please later. And if in these cases,\nrepulsive as they are to our ordinary worldly way of judging, we find\nourselves compelled to acknowledge religion\u2019s value and treat it with\nrespect, it will have proved in some way its value for life at large. By\nsubtracting and toning down extravagances we may thereupon proceed to\ntrace the boundaries of its legitimate sway.\nTo be sure, it makes our task difficult to have to deal so much with\neccentricities and extremes. \u201cHow _can_ religion on the whole be the most\nimportant of all human functions,\u201d you may ask, \u201cif every several\nmanifestation of it in turn have to be corrected and sobered down and\npruned away?\u201d Such a thesis seems a paradox impossible to sustain\nreasonably,\u2014yet I believe that something like it will have to be our final\ncontention. That personal attitude which the individual finds himself\nimpelled to take up towards what he apprehends to be the divine\u2014and you\nwill remember that this was our definition\u2014will prove to be both a\nhelpless and a sacrificial attitude. That is, we shall have to confess to\nat least some amount of dependence on sheer mercy, and to practice some\namount of renunciation, great or small, to save our souls alive. The\nconstitution of the world we live in requires it:\u2014\n\u201cEntbehren sollst du! sollst entbehren!\nDas ist der ewige Gesang\nDer jedem an die Ohren klingt,\nDen, unser ganzes Leben lang\nUns heiser jede Stunde singt.\u201d\nFor when all is said and done, we are in the end absolutely dependent on\nthe universe; and into sacrifices and surrenders of some sort,\ndeliberately looked at and accepted, we are drawn and pressed as into our\nonly permanent positions of repose. Now in those states of mind which fall\nshort of religion, the surrender is submitted to as an imposition of\nnecessity, and the sacrifice is undergone at the very best without\ncomplaint. In the religious life, on the contrary, surrender and sacrifice\nare positively espoused: even unnecessary givings\u2010up are added in order\nthat the happiness may increase. _Religion thus makes easy and felicitous\nwhat in any case is necessary_; and if it be the only agency that can\naccomplish this result, its vital importance as a human faculty stands\nvindicated beyond dispute. It becomes an essential organ of our life,\nperforming a function which no other portion of our nature can so\nsuccessfully fulfill. From the merely biological point of view, so to call\nit, this is a conclusion to which, so far as I can now see, we shall\ninevitably be led, and led moreover by following the purely empirical\nmethod of demonstration which I sketched to you in the first lecture. Of\nthe farther office of religion as a metaphysical revelation I will say\nnothing now.\nBut to foreshadow the terminus of one\u2019s investigations is one thing, and\nto arrive there safely is another. In the next lecture, abandoning the\nextreme generalities which have engrossed us hitherto, I propose that we\nbegin our actual journey by addressing ourselves directly to the concrete\nfacts.\nLECTURE III. THE REALITY OF THE UNSEEN.\nWere one asked to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and\nmost general terms possible, one might say that it consists of the belief\nthat there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in\nharmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. This belief and this adjustment\nare the religious attitude in the soul. I wish during this hour to call\nyour attention to some of the psychological peculiarities of such an\nattitude as this, of belief in an object which we cannot see. All our\nattitudes, moral, practical, or emotional, as well as religious, are due\nto the \u201cobjects\u201d of our consciousness, the things which we believe to\nexist, whether really or ideally, along with ourselves. Such objects may\nbe present to our senses, or they may be present only to our thought. In\neither case they elicit from us a _reaction_; and the reaction due to\nthings of thought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due to\nsensible presences. It may be even stronger. The memory of an insult may\nmake us angrier than the insult did when we received it. We are frequently\nmore ashamed of our blunders afterwards than we were at the moment of\nmaking them; and in general our whole higher prudential and moral life is\nbased on the fact that material sensations actually present may have a\nweaker influence on our action than ideas of remoter facts.\nThe more concrete objects of most men\u2019s religion, the deities whom they\nworship, are known to them only in idea. It has been vouchsafed, for\nexample, to very few Christian believers to have had a sensible vision of\ntheir Saviour; though enough appearances of this sort are on record, by\nway of miraculous exception, to merit our attention later. The whole force\nof the Christian religion, therefore, so far as belief in the divine\npersonages determines the prevalent attitude of the believer, is in\ngeneral exerted by the instrumentality of pure ideas, of which nothing in\nthe individual\u2019s past experience directly serves as a model.\nBut in addition to these ideas of the more concrete religious objects,\nreligion is full of abstract objects which prove to have an equal power.\nGod\u2019s attributes as such, his holiness, his justice, his mercy, his\nabsoluteness, his infinity, his omniscience, his tri\u2010unity, the various\nmysteries of the redemptive process, the operation of the sacraments,\netc., have proved fertile wells of inspiring meditation for Christian\nbelievers.(22) We shall see later that the absence of definite sensible\nimages is positively insisted on by the mystical authorities in all\nreligions as the _sine qua non_ of a successful orison, or contemplation\nof the higher divine truths. Such contemplations are expected (and\nabundantly verify the expectation, as we shall also see) to influence the\nbeliever\u2019s subsequent attitude very powerfully for good.\nImmanuel Kant held a curious doctrine about such objects of belief as God,\nthe design of creation, the soul, its freedom, and the life hereafter.\nThese things, he said, are properly not objects of knowledge at all. Our\nconceptions always require a sense\u2010content to work with, and as the words\n\u201csoul,\u201d \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cimmortality,\u201d cover no distinctive sense\u2010content whatever,\nit follows that theoretically speaking they are words devoid of any\nsignificance. Yet strangely enough they have a definite meaning _for our\npractice_. We can act _as if_ there were a God; feel _as if_ we were free;\nconsider Nature _as if_ she were full of special designs; lay plans _as\nif_ we were to be immortal; and we find then that these words do make a\ngenuine difference in our moral life. Our faith _that_ these\nunintelligible objects actually exist proves thus to be a full equivalent\nin _praktischer Hinsicht_, as Kant calls it, or from the point of view of\nour action, for a knowledge of _what_ they might be, in case we were\npermitted positively to conceive them. So we have the strange phenomenon,\nas Kant assures us, of a mind believing with all its strength in the real\npresence of a set of things of no one of which it can form any notion\nwhatsoever.\nMy object in thus recalling Kant\u2019s doctrine to your mind is not to express\nany opinion as to the accuracy of this particularly uncouth part of his\nphilosophy, but only to illustrate the characteristic of human nature\nwhich we are considering, by an example so classical in its exaggeration.\nThe sentiment of reality can indeed attach itself so strongly to our\nobject of belief that our whole life is polarized through and through, so\nto speak, by its sense of the existence of the thing believed in, and yet\nthat thing, for purpose of definite description, can hardly be said to be\npresent to our mind at all. It is as if a bar of iron, without touch or\nsight, with no representative faculty whatever, might nevertheless be\nstrongly endowed with an inner capacity for magnetic feeling; and as if,\nthrough the various arousals of its magnetism by magnets coming and going\nin its neighborhood, it might be consciously determined to different\nattitudes and tendencies. Such a bar of iron could never give you an\noutward description of the agencies that had the power of stirring it so\nstrongly; yet of their presence, and of their significance for its life,\nit would be intensely aware through every fibre of its being.\nIt is not only the Ideas of pure Reason, as Kant styled them, that have\nthis power of making us vitally feel presences that we are impotent\narticulately to describe. All sorts of higher abstractions bring with them\nthe same kind of impalpable appeal. Remember those passages from Emerson\nwhich I read at my last lecture. The whole universe of concrete objects,\nas we know them, swims, not only for such a transcendentalist writer, but\nfor all of us, in a wider and higher universe of abstract ideas, that lend\nit its significance. As time, space, and the ether soak through all\nthings, so (we feel) do abstract and essential goodness, beauty, strength,\nsignificance, justice, soak through all things good, strong, significant,\nand just.\nSuch ideas, and others equally abstract, form the background for all our\nfacts, the fountain\u2010head of all the possibilities we conceive of. They\ngive its \u201cnature,\u201d as we call it, to every special thing. Everything we\nknow is \u201cwhat\u201d it is by sharing in the nature of one of these\nabstractions. We can never look directly at them, for they are bodiless\nand featureless and footless, but we grasp all other things by their\nmeans, and in handling the real world we should be stricken with\nhelplessness in just so far forth as we might lose these mental objects,\nthese adjectives and adverbs and predicates and heads of classification\nand conception.\nThis absolute determinability of our mind by abstractions is one of the\ncardinal facts in our human constitution. Polarizing and magnetizing us as\nthey do, we turn towards them and from them, we seek them, hold them, hate\nthem, bless them, just as if they were so many concrete beings. And beings\nthey are, beings as real in the realm which they inhabit as the changing\nthings of sense are in the realm of space.\nPlato gave so brilliant and impressive a defense of this common human\nfeeling, that the doctrine of the reality of abstract objects has been\nknown as the platonic theory of ideas ever since. Abstract Beauty, for\nexample, is for Plato a perfectly definite individual being, of which the\nintellect is aware as of something additional to all the perishing\nbeauties of the earth. \u201cThe true order of going,\u201d he says, in the often\nquoted passage in his \u201cBanquet,\u201d \u201cis to use the beauties of earth as steps\nalong which one mounts upwards for the sake of that other Beauty, going\nfrom one to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to\nfair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair\nnotions he arrives at the notion of absolute Beauty, and at last knows\nwhat the essence of Beauty is.\u201d(23) In our last lecture we had a glimpse\nof the way in which a platonizing writer like Emerson may treat the\nabstract divineness of things, the moral structure of the universe, as a\nfact worthy of worship. In those various churches without a God which to\u2010\nday are spreading through the world under the name of ethical societies,\nwe have a similar worship of the abstract divine, the moral law believed\nin as an ultimate object. \u201cScience\u201d in many minds is genuinely taking the\nplace of a religion. Where this is so, the scientist treats the \u201cLaws of\nNature\u201d as objective facts to be revered. A brilliant school of\ninterpretation of Greek mythology would have it that in their origin the\nGreek gods were only half\u2010metaphoric personifications of those great\nspheres of abstract law and order into which the natural world falls\napart\u2014the sky\u2010sphere, the ocean\u2010sphere, the earth\u2010sphere, and the like;\njust as even now we may speak of the smile of the morning, the kiss of the\nbreeze, or the bite of the cold, without really meaning that these\nphenomena of nature actually wear a human face.(24)\nAs regards the origin of the Greek gods, we need not at present seek an\nopinion. But the whole array of our instances leads to a conclusion\nsomething like this: It is as if there were in the human consciousness a\n_sense of reality, a feeling of objective presence, a perception_ of what\nwe may call \u201c_something there_,\u201d more deep and more general than any of\nthe special and particular \u201csenses\u201d by which the current psychology\nsupposes existent realities to be originally revealed. If this were so, we\nmight suppose the senses to waken our attitudes and conduct as they so\nhabitually do, by first exciting this sense of reality; but anything else,\nany idea, for example, that might similarly excite it, would have that\nsame prerogative of appearing real which objects of sense normally\npossess. So far as religious conceptions were able to touch this reality\u2010\nfeeling, they would be believed in in spite of criticism, even though they\nmight be so vague and remote as to be almost unimaginable, even though\nthey might be such non\u2010entities in point of _whatness_, as Kant makes the\nobjects of his moral theology to be.\nThe most curious proofs of the existence of such an undifferentiated sense\nof reality as this are found in experiences of hallucination. It often\nhappens that an hallucination is imperfectly developed: the person\naffected will feel a \u201cpresence\u201d in the room, definitely localized, facing\nin one particular way, real in the most emphatic sense of the word, often\ncoming suddenly, and as suddenly gone; and yet neither seen, heard,\ntouched, nor cognized in any of the usual \u201csensible\u201d ways. Let me give you\nan example of this, before I pass to the objects with whose presence\nreligion is more peculiarly concerned.\nAn intimate friend of mine, one of the keenest intellects I know, has had\nseveral experiences of this sort. He writes as follows in response to my\ninquiries:\u2014\n\u201cI have several times within the past few years felt the so\u2010called\n\u2018consciousness of a presence.\u2019 The experiences which I have in\nmind are clearly distinguishable from another kind of experience\nwhich I have had very frequently, and which I fancy many persons\nwould also call the \u2018consciousness of a presence.\u2019 But the\ndifference for me between the two sets of experience is as great\nas the difference between feeling a slight warmth originating I\nknow not where, and standing in the midst of a conflagration with\nall the ordinary senses alert.\n\u201cIt was about September, 1884, when I had the first experience. On\nthe previous night I had had, after getting into bed at my rooms\nin College, a vivid tactile hallucination of being grasped by the\narm, which made me get up and search the room for an intruder; but\nthe sense of presence properly so called came on the next night.\nAfter I had got into bed and blown out the candle, I lay awake\nawhile thinking on the previous night\u2019s experience, when suddenly\nI _felt_ something come into the room and stay close to my bed. It\nremained only a minute or two. I did not recognize it by any\nordinary sense, and yet there was a horribly unpleasant\n\u2018sensation\u2019 connected with it. It stirred something more at the\nroots of my being than any ordinary perception. The feeling had\nsomething of the quality of a very large tearing vital pain\nspreading chiefly over the chest, but within the organism\u2014and yet\nthe feeling was not _pain_ so much as _abhorrence_. At all events,\nsomething was present with me, and I knew its presence far more\nsurely than I have ever known the presence of any fleshly living\ncreature. I was conscious of its departure as of its coming: an\nalmost instantaneously swift going through the door, and the\n\u2018horrible sensation\u2019 disappeared.\n\u201cOn the third night when I retired my mind was absorbed in some\nlectures which I was preparing, and I was still absorbed in these\nwhen I became aware of the actual presence (though not of the\n_coming_) of the thing that was there the night before, and of the\n\u2018horrible sensation.\u2019 I then mentally concentrated all my effort\nto charge this \u2018thing,\u2019 if it was evil, to depart, if it was _not_\nevil, to tell me who or what it was, and if it could not explain\nitself, to go, and that I would compel it to go. It went as on the\nprevious night, and my body quickly recovered its normal state.\n\u201cOn two other occasions in my life I have had precisely the same\n\u2018horrible sensation.\u2019 Once it lasted a full quarter of an hour. In\nall three instances the certainty that there in outward space\nthere stood _something_ was indescribably _stronger_ than the\nordinary certainty of companionship when we are in the close\npresence of ordinary living people. The something seemed close to\nme, and intensely more real than any ordinary perception. Although\nI felt it to be like unto myself, so to speak, or finite, small,\nand distressful, as it were, I didn\u2019t recognize it as any\nindividual being or person.\u201d\nOf course such an experience as this does not connect itself with the\nreligious sphere. Yet it may upon occasion do so; and the same\ncorrespondent informs me that at more than one other conjuncture he had\nthe sense of presence developed with equal intensity and abruptness, only\nthen it was filled with a quality of joy.\n\u201cThere was not a mere consciousness of something there, but fused\nin the central happiness of it, a startling awareness of some\nineffable good. Not vague either, not like the emotional effect of\nsome poem, or scene, or blossom, of music, but the sure knowledge\nof the close presence of a sort of mighty person, and after it\nwent, the memory persisted as the one perception of reality.\nEverything else might be a dream, but not that.\u201d\nMy friend, as it oddly happens, does not interpret these latter\nexperiences theistically, as signifying the presence of God. But it would\nclearly not have been unnatural to interpret them as a revelation of the\ndeity\u2019s existence. When we reach the subject of mysticism, we shall have\nmuch more to say upon this head.\nLest the oddity of these phenomena should disconcert you, I will venture\nto read you a couple of similar narratives, much shorter, merely to show\nthat we are dealing with a well\u2010marked natural kind of fact. In the first\ncase, which I take from the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research,\nthe sense of presence developed in a few moments into a distinctly\nvisualized hallucination,\u2014but I leave that part of the story out.\n\u201cI had read,\u201d the narrator says, \u201csome twenty minutes or so, was\nthoroughly absorbed in the book, my mind was perfectly quiet, and\nfor the time being my friends were quite forgotten, when suddenly\nwithout a moment\u2019s warning my whole being seemed roused to the\nhighest state of tension or aliveness, and I was aware, with an\nintenseness not easily imagined by those who had never experienced\nit, that another being or presence was not only in the room, but\nquite close to me. I put my book down, and although my excitement\nwas great, I felt quite collected, and not conscious of any sense\nof fear. Without changing my position, and looking straight at the\nfire, I knew somehow that my friend A. H. was standing at my left\nelbow, but so far behind me as to be hidden by the armchair in\nwhich I was leaning back. Moving my eyes round slightly without\notherwise changing my position, the lower portion of one leg\nbecame visible, and I instantly recognized the gray\u2010blue material\nof trousers he often wore, but the stuff appeared semi\u2010\ntransparent, reminding me of tobacco smoke in\nconsistency,\u201d(25)\u2014and hereupon the visual hallucination came.\nAnother informant writes:\u2014\n\u201cQuite early in the night I was awakened.... I felt as if I had\nbeen aroused intentionally, and at first thought some one was\nbreaking into the house.... I then turned on my side to go to\nsleep again, and immediately felt a consciousness of a presence in\nthe room, and singular to state, it was not the consciousness of a\nlive person, but of a spiritual presence. This may provoke a\nsmile, but I can only tell you the facts as they occurred to me. I\ndo not know how to better describe my sensations than by simply\nstating that I felt a consciousness of a spiritual presence.... I\nfelt also at the same time a strong feeling of superstitious\ndread, as if something strange and fearful were about to\nhappen.\u201d(26)\nProfessor Flournoy of Geneva gives me the following testimony of a friend\nof his, a lady, who has the gift of automatic or involuntary writing:\u2014\n\u201cWhenever I practice automatic writing, what makes me feel that it\nis not due to a subconscious self is the feeling I always have of\na foreign presence, external to my body. It is sometimes so\ndefinitely characterized that I could point to its exact position.\nThis impression of presence is impossible to describe. It varies\nin intensity and clearness according to the personality from whom\nthe writing professes to come. If it is some one whom I love, I\nfeel it immediately, before any writing has come. My heart seems\nto recognize it.\u201d\nIn an earlier book of mine I have cited at full length a curious case of\npresence felt by a blind man. The presence was that of the figure of a\ngray\u2010bearded man dressed in a pepper and salt suit, squeezing himself\nunder the crack of the door and moving across the floor of the room\ntowards a sofa. The blind subject of this quasi\u2010hallucination is an\nexceptionally intelligent reporter. He is entirely without internal visual\nimagery and cannot represent light or colors to himself, and is positive\nthat his other senses, hearing, etc., were not involved in this false\nperception. It seems to have been an abstract conception rather, with the\nfeelings of reality and spatial outwardness directly attached to it\u2014in\nother words, a fully objectified and exteriorized _idea_.\nSuch cases, taken along with others which would be too tedious for\nquotation, seem sufficiently to prove the existence in our mental\nmachinery of a sense of present reality more diffused and general than\nthat which our special senses yield. For the psychologists the tracing of\nthe organic seat of such a feeling would form a pretty problem\u2014nothing\ncould be more natural than to connect it with the muscular sense, with the\nfeeling that our muscles were innervating themselves for action.\nWhatsoever thus innervated our activity, or \u201cmade our flesh creep,\u201d\u2014our\nsenses are what do so oftenest,\u2014might then appear real and present, even\nthough it were but an abstract idea. But with such vague conjectures we\nhave no concern at present, for our interest lies with the faculty rather\nthan with its organic seat.\nLike all positive affections of consciousness, the sense of reality has\nits negative counterpart in the shape of a feeling of unreality by which\npersons may be haunted, and of which one sometimes hears complaint:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I reflect on the fact that I have made my appearance by\naccident upon a globe itself whirled through space as the sport of\nthe catastrophes of the heavens,\u201d says Madame Ackermann; \u201cwhen I\nsee myself surrounded by beings as ephemeral and incomprehensible\nas I am myself, and all excitedly pursuing pure chimeras, I\nexperience a strange feeling of being in a dream. It seems to me\nas if I have loved and suffered and that erelong I shall die, in a\ndream. My last word will be, \u2018I have been dreaming.\u2019 \u201d(27)\nIn another lecture we shall see how in morbid melancholy this sense of the\nunreality of things may become a carking pain, and even lead to suicide.\nWe may now lay it down as certain that in the distinctively religious\nsphere of experience, many persons (how many we cannot tell) possess the\nobjects of their belief, not in the form of mere conceptions which their\nintellect accepts as true, but rather in the form of quasi\u2010sensible\nrealities directly apprehended. As his sense of the real presence of these\nobjects fluctuates, so the believer alternates between warmth and coldness\nin his faith. Other examples will bring this home to one better than\nabstract description, so I proceed immediately to cite some. The first\nexample is a negative one, deploring the loss of the sense in question. I\nhave extracted it from an account given me by a scientific man of my\nacquaintance, of his religious life. It seems to me to show clearly that\nthe feeling of reality may be something more like a sensation than an\nintellectual operation properly so\u2010called.\n\u201cBetween twenty and thirty I gradually became more and more\nagnostic and irreligious, yet I cannot say that I ever lost that\n\u2018indefinite consciousness\u2019 which Herbert Spencer describes so\nwell, of an Absolute Reality behind phenomena. For me this Reality\nwas not the pure Unknowable of Spencer\u2019s philosophy, for although\nI had ceased my childish prayers to God, and never prayed to _It_\nin a formal manner, yet my more recent experience shows me to have\nbeen in a relation to _It_ which practically was the same thing as\nprayer. Whenever I had any trouble, especially when I had conflict\nwith other people, either domestically or in the way of business,\nor when I was depressed in spirits or anxious about affairs, I now\nrecognize that I used to fall back for support upon this curious\nrelation I felt myself to be in to this fundamental cosmical _It_.\nIt was on my side, or I was on Its side, however you please to\nterm it, in the particular trouble, and it always strengthened me\nand seemed to give me endless vitality to feel its underlying and\nsupporting presence. In fact, it was an unfailing fountain of\nliving justice, truth, and strength, to which I instinctively\nturned at times of weakness, and it always brought me out. I know\nnow that it was a personal relation I was in to it, because of\nlate years the power of communicating with it has left me, and I\nam conscious of a perfectly definite loss. I used never to fail to\nfind it when I turned to it. Then came a set of years when\nsometimes I found it, and then again I would be wholly unable to\nmake connection with it. I remember many occasions on which at\nnight in bed, I would be unable to get to sleep on account of\nworry. I turned this way and that in the darkness, and groped\nmentally for the familiar sense of that higher mind of my mind\nwhich had always seemed to be close at hand as it were, closing\nthe passage, and yielding support, but there was no electric\ncurrent. A blank was there instead of _It_: I couldn\u2019t find\nanything. Now, at the age of nearly fifty, my power of getting\ninto connection with it has entirely left me; and I have to\nconfess that a great help has gone out of my life. Life has become\ncuriously dead and indifferent; and I can now see that my old\nexperience was probably exactly the same thing as the prayers of\nthe orthodox, only I did not call them by that name. What I have\nspoken of as \u2018It\u2019 was practically not Spencer\u2019s Unknowable, but\njust my own instinctive and individual God, whom I relied upon for\nhigher sympathy, but whom somehow I have lost.\u201d\nNothing is more common in the pages of religious biography than the way in\nwhich seasons of lively and of difficult faith are described as\nalternating. Probably every religious person has the recollection of\nparticular crises in which a directer vision of the truth, a direct\nperception, perhaps, of a living God\u2019s existence, swept in and overwhelmed\nthe languor of the more ordinary belief. In James Russell Lowell\u2019s\ncorrespondence there is a brief memorandum of an experience of this kind:\u2014\n\u201cI had a revelation last Friday evening. I was at Mary\u2019s, and\nhappening to say something of the presence of spirits (of whom, I\nsaid, I was often dimly aware), Mr. Putnam entered into an\nargument with me on spiritual matters. As I was speaking, the\nwhole system rose up before me like a vague destiny looming from\nthe Abyss. I never before so clearly felt the Spirit of God in me\nand around me. The whole room seemed to me full of God. The air\nseemed to waver to and fro with the presence of Something I knew\nnot what. I spoke with the calmness and clearness of a prophet. I\ncannot tell you what this revelation was. I have not yet studied\nit enough. But I shall perfect it one day, and then you shall hear\nit and acknowledge its grandeur.\u201d(28)\nHere is a longer and more developed experience from a manuscript\ncommunication by a clergyman,\u2014I take it from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript\ncollection:\u2014\n\u201cI remember the night, and almost the very spot on the hilltop,\nwhere my soul opened out, as it were, into the Infinite, and there\nwas a rushing together of the two worlds, the inner and the outer.\nIt was deep calling unto deep,\u2014the deep that my own struggle had\nopened up within being answered by the unfathomable deep without,\nreaching beyond the stars. I stood alone with Him who had made me,\nand all the beauty of the world, and love, and sorrow, and even\ntemptation. I did not seek Him, but felt the perfect unison of my\nspirit with His. The ordinary sense of things around me faded. For\nthe moment nothing but an ineffable joy and exaltation remained.\nIt is impossible fully to describe the experience. It was like the\neffect of some great orchestra when all the separate notes have\nmelted into one swelling harmony that leaves the listener\nconscious of nothing save that his soul is being wafted upwards,\nand almost bursting with its own emotion. The perfect stillness of\nthe night was thrilled by a more solemn silence. The darkness held\na presence that was all the more felt because it was not seen. I\ncould not any more have doubted that _He_ was there than that I\nwas. Indeed, I felt myself to be, if possible, the less real of\nthe two.\n\u201cMy highest faith in God and truest idea of him were then born in\nme. I have stood upon the Mount of Vision since, and felt the\nEternal round about me. But never since has there come quite the\nsame stirring of the heart. Then, if ever, I believe, I stood face\nto face with God, and was born anew of his spirit. There was, as I\nrecall it, no sudden change of thought or of belief, except that\nmy early crude conception had, as it were, burst into flower.\nThere was no destruction of the old, but a rapid, wonderful\nunfolding. Since that time no discussion that I have heard of the\nproofs of God\u2019s existence has been able to shake my faith. Having\nonce felt the presence of God\u2019s spirit, I have never lost it again\nfor long. My most assuring evidence of his existence is deeply\nrooted in that hour of vision, in the memory of that supreme\nexperience, and in the conviction, gained from reading and\nreflection, that something the same has come to all who have found\nGod. I am aware that it may justly be called mystical. I am not\nenough acquainted with philosophy to defend it from that or any\nother charge. I feel that in writing of it I have overlaid it with\nwords rather than put it clearly to your thought. But, such as it\nis, I have described it as carefully as I now am able to do.\u201d\nHere is another document, even more definite in character, which, the\nwriter being a Swiss, I translate from the French original.(29)\n\u201cI was in perfect health: we were on our sixth day of tramping,\nand in good training. We had come the day before from Sixt to\nTrient by Buet. I felt neither fatigue, hunger, nor thirst, and my\nstate of mind was equally healthy. I had had at Forlaz good news\nfrom home; I was subject to no anxiety, either near or remote, for\nwe had a good guide, and there was not a shadow of uncertainty\nabout the road we should follow. I can best describe the condition\nin which I was by calling it a state of equilibrium. When all at\nonce I experienced a feeling of being raised above myself, I felt\nthe presence of God\u2014I tell of the thing just as I was conscious of\nit\u2014as if his goodness and his power were penetrating me\naltogether. The throb of emotion was so violent that I could\nbarely tell the boys to pass on and not wait for me. I then sat\ndown on a stone, unable to stand any longer, and my eyes\noverflowed with tears. I thanked God that in the course of my life\nhe had taught me to know him, that he sustained my life and took\npity both on the insignificant creature and on the sinner that I\nwas. I begged him ardently that my life might be consecrated to\nthe doing of his will. I felt his reply, which was that I should\ndo his will from day to day, in humility and poverty, leaving him,\nthe Almighty God, to be judge of whether I should some time be\ncalled to bear witness more conspicuously. Then, slowly, the\necstasy left my heart; that is, I felt that God had withdrawn the\ncommunion which he had granted, and I was able to walk on, but\nvery slowly, so strongly was I still possessed by the interior\nemotion. Besides, I had wept uninterruptedly for several minutes,\nmy eyes were swollen, and I did not wish my companions to see me.\nThe state of ecstasy may have lasted four or five minutes,\nalthough it seemed at the time to last much longer. My comrades\nwaited for me ten minutes at the cross of Barine, but I took about\ntwenty\u2010five or thirty minutes to join them, for as well as I can\nremember, they said that I had kept them back for about half an\nhour. The impression had been so profound that in climbing slowly\nthe slope I asked myself if it were possible that Moses on Sinai\ncould have had a more intimate communication with God. I think it\nwell to add that in this ecstasy of mine God had neither form,\ncolor, odor, nor taste; moreover, that the feeling of his presence\nwas accompanied with no determinate localization. It was rather as\nif my personality had been transformed by the presence of a\n_spiritual spirit_. But the more I seek words to express this\nintimate intercourse, the more I feel the impossibility of\ndescribing the thing by any of our usual images. At bottom the\nexpression most apt to render what I felt is this: God was\npresent, though invisible; he fell under no one of my senses, yet\nmy consciousness perceived him.\u201d\nThe adjective \u201cmystical\u201d is technically applied, most often, to states\nthat are of brief duration. Of course such hours of rapture as the last\ntwo persons describe are mystical experiences, of which in a later lecture\nI shall have much to say. Meanwhile here is the abridged record of another\nmystical or semi\u2010mystical experience, in a mind evidently framed by nature\nfor ardent piety. I owe it to Starbuck\u2019s collection. The lady who gives\nthe account is the daughter of a man well known in his time as a writer\nagainst Christianity. The suddenness of her conversion shows well how\nnative the sense of God\u2019s presence must be to certain minds. She relates\nthat she was brought up in entire ignorance of Christian doctrine, but,\nwhen in Germany, after being talked to by Christian friends, she read the\nBible and prayed, and finally the plan of salvation flashed upon her like\na stream of light.\n\u201cTo this day,\u201d she writes, \u201cI cannot understand dallying with\nreligion and the commands of God. The very instant I heard my\nFather\u2019s cry calling unto me, my heart bounded in recognition. I\nran, I stretched forth my arms, I cried aloud, \u2018Here, here I am,\nmy Father.\u2019 Oh, happy child, what should I do? \u2018Love me,\u2019 answered\nmy God. \u2018I do, I do,\u2019 I cried passionately. \u2018Come unto me,\u2019 called\nmy Father. \u2018I will,\u2019 my heart panted. Did I stop to ask a single\nquestion? Not one. It never occurred to me to ask whether I was\ngood enough, or to hesitate over my unfitness, or to find out what\nI thought of his church, or ... to wait until I should be\nsatisfied. Satisfied! I was satisfied. Had I not found my God and\nmy Father? Did he not love me? Had he not called me? Was there not\na Church into which I might enter?... Since then I have had direct\nanswers to prayer\u2014so significant as to be almost like talking with\nGod and hearing his answer. The idea of God\u2019s reality has never\nleft me for one moment.\u201d\nHere is still another case, the writer being a man aged twenty\u2010seven, in\nwhich the experience, probably almost as characteristic, is less vividly\ndescribed:\u2014\n\u201cI have on a number of occasions felt that I had enjoyed a period\nof intimate communion with the divine. These meetings came unasked\nand unexpected, and seemed to consist merely in the temporary\nobliteration of the conventionalities which usually surround and\ncover my life.... Once it was when from the summit of a high\nmountain I looked over a gashed and corrugated landscape extending\nto a long convex of ocean that ascended to the horizon, and again\nfrom the same point when I could see nothing beneath me but a\nboundless expanse of white cloud, on the blown surface of which a\nfew high peaks, including the one I was on, seemed plunging about\nas if they were dragging their anchors. What I felt on these\noccasions was a temporary loss of my own identity, accompanied by\nan illumination which revealed to me a deeper significance than I\nhad been wont to attach to life. It is in this that I find my\njustification for saying that I have enjoyed communication with\nGod. Of course the absence of such a being as this would be chaos.\nI cannot conceive of life without its presence.\u201d\nOf the more habitual and so to speak chronic sense of God\u2019s presence the\nfollowing sample from Professor Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection may serve\nto give an idea. It is from a man aged forty\u2010nine,\u2014probably thousands of\nunpretending Christians would write an almost identical account.\n\u201cGod is more real to me than any thought or thing or person. I\nfeel his presence positively, and the more as I live in closer\nharmony with his laws as written in my body and mind. I feel him\nin the sunshine or rain; and awe mingled with a delicious\nrestfulness most nearly describes my feelings. I talk to him as to\na companion in prayer and praise, and our communion is delightful.\nHe answers me again and again, often in words so clearly spoken\nthat it seems my outer ear must have carried the tone, but\ngenerally in strong mental impressions. Usually a text of\nScripture, unfolding some new view of him and his love for me, and\ncare for my safety. I could give hundreds of instances, in school\nmatters, social problems, financial difficulties, etc. That he is\nmine and I am his never leaves me, it is an abiding joy. Without\nit life would be a blank, a desert, a shoreless, trackless waste.\u201d\nI subjoin some more examples from writers of different ages and sexes.\nThey are also from Professor Starbuck\u2019s collection, and their number might\nbe greatly multiplied. The first is from a man twenty\u2010seven years old:\u2014\n\u201cGod is quite real to me. I talk to him and often get answers.\nThoughts sudden and distinct from any I have been entertaining\ncome to my mind after asking God for his direction. Something over\na year ago I was for some weeks in the direst perplexity. When the\ntrouble first appeared before me I was dazed, but before long (two\nor three hours) I could hear distinctly a passage of Scripture:\n\u2018My grace is sufficient for thee.\u2019 Every time my thoughts turned\nto the trouble I could hear this quotation. I don\u2019t think I ever\ndoubted the existence of God, or had him drop out of my\nconsciousness. God has frequently stepped into my affairs very\nperceptibly, and I feel that he directs many little details all\nthe time. But on two or three occasions he has ordered ways for me\nvery contrary to my ambitions and plans.\u201d\nAnother statement (none the less valuable psychologically for being so\ndecidedly childish) is that of a boy of seventeen:\u2014\n\u201cSometimes as I go to church, I sit down, join in the service, and\nbefore I go out I feel as if God was with me, right side of me,\nsinging and reading the Psalms with me.... And then again I feel\nas if I could sit beside him, and put my arms around him, kiss\nhim, etc. When I am taking Holy Communion at the altar, I try to\nget with him and generally feel his presence.\u201d\nI let a few other cases follow at random:\u2014\n\u201cGod surrounds me like the physical atmosphere. He is closer to me\nthan my own breath. In him literally I live and move and have my\nbeing.\u201d\u2014\n\u201cThere are times when I seem to stand, in his very presence, to\ntalk with him. Answers to prayer have come, sometimes direct and\noverwhelming in their revelation of his presence and powers. There\nare times when God seems far off, but this is always my own\nfault.\u201d\u2014\n\u201cI have the sense of a presence, strong, and at the same time\nsoothing, which hovers over me. Sometimes it seems to enwrap me\nwith sustaining arms.\u201d\nSuch is the human ontological imagination, and such is the convincingness\nof what it brings to birth. Unpicturable beings are realized, and realized\nwith an intensity almost like that of an hallucination. They determine our\nvital attitude as decisively as the vital attitude of lovers is determined\nby the habitual sense, by which each is haunted, of the other being in the\nworld. A lover has notoriously this sense of the continuous being of his\nidol, even when his attention is addressed to other matters and he no\nlonger represents her features. He cannot forget her; she uninterruptedly\naffects him through and through.\nI spoke of the convincingness of these feelings of reality, and I must\ndwell a moment longer on that point. They are as convincing to those who\nhave them as any direct sensible experiences can be, and they are, as a\nrule, much more convincing than results established by mere logic ever\nare. One may indeed be entirely without them; probably more than one of\nyou here present is without them in any marked degree; but if you do have\nthem, and have them at all strongly, the probability is that you cannot\nhelp regarding them as genuine perceptions of truth, as revelations of a\nkind of reality which no adverse argument, however unanswerable by you in\nwords, can expel from your belief. The opinion opposed to mysticism in\nphilosophy is sometimes spoken of as _rationalism_. Rationalism insists\nthat all our beliefs ought ultimately to find for themselves articulate\ngrounds. Such grounds, for rationalism, must consist of four things: (1)\ndefinitely statable abstract principles; (2) definite facts of sensation;\n(3) definite hypotheses based on such facts; and (4) definite inferences\nlogically drawn. Vague impressions of something indefinable have no place\nin the rationalistic system, which on its positive side is surely a\nsplendid intellectual tendency, for not only are all our philosophies\nfruits of it, but physical science (amongst other good things) is its\nresult.\nNevertheless, if we look on man\u2019s whole mental life as it exists, on the\nlife of men that lies in them apart from their learning and science, and\nthat they inwardly and privately follow, we have to confess that the part\nof it of which rationalism can give an account is relatively superficial.\nIt is the part that has the _prestige_ undoubtedly, for it has the\nloquacity, it can challenge you for proofs, and chop logic, and put you\ndown with words. But it will fail to convince or convert you all the same,\nif your dumb intuitions are opposed to its conclusions. If you have\nintuitions at all, they come from a deeper level of your nature than the\nloquacious level which rationalism inhabits. Your whole subconscious life,\nyour impulses, your faiths, your needs, your divinations, have prepared\nthe premises, of which your consciousness now feels the weight of the\nresult; and something in you absolutely _knows_ that that result must be\ntruer than any logic\u2010chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may\ncontradict it. This inferiority of the rationalistic level in founding\nbelief is just as manifest when rationalism argues for religion as when it\nargues against it. That vast literature of proofs of God\u2019s existence drawn\nfrom the order of nature, which a century ago seemed so overwhelmingly\nconvincing, to\u2010day does little more than gather dust in libraries, for the\nsimple reason that our generation has ceased to believe in the kind of God\nit argued for. Whatever sort of a being God may be, we _know_ to\u2010day that\nhe is nevermore that mere external inventor of \u201ccontrivances\u201d intended to\nmake manifest his \u201cglory\u201d in which our great\u2010grandfathers took such\nsatisfaction, though just how we know this we cannot possibly make clear\nby words either to others or to ourselves. I defy any of you here fully to\naccount for your persuasion that if a God exist he must be a more cosmic\nand tragic personage than that Being.\nThe truth is that in the metaphysical and religious sphere, articulate\nreasons are cogent for us only when our inarticulate feelings of reality\nhave already been impressed in favor of the same conclusion. Then, indeed,\nour intuitions and our reason work together, and great world\u2010ruling\nsystems, like that of the Buddhist or of the Catholic philosophy, may grow\nup. Our impulsive belief is here always what sets up the original body of\ntruth, and our articulately verbalized philosophy is but its showy\ntranslation into formulas. The unreasoned and immediate assurance is the\ndeep thing in us, the reasoned argument is but a surface exhibition.\nInstinct leads, intelligence does but follow. If a person feels the\npresence of a living God after the fashion shown by my quotations, your\ncritical arguments, be they never so superior, will vainly set themselves\nto change his faith.\nPlease observe, however, that I do not yet say that it is _better_ that\nthe subconscious and non\u2010rational should thus hold primacy in the\nreligious realm. I confine myself to simply pointing out that they do so\nhold it as a matter of fact.\nSo much for our sense of the reality of the religious objects. Let me now\nsay a brief word more about the attitudes they characteristically awaken.\nWe have already agreed that they are _solemn_; and we have seen reason to\nthink that the most distinctive of them is the sort of joy which may\nresult in extreme cases from absolute self\u2010surrender. The sense of the\nkind of object to which the surrender is made has much to do with\ndetermining the precise complexion of the joy; and the whole phenomenon is\nmore complex than any simple formula allows. In the literature of the\nsubject, sadness and gladness have each been emphasized in turn. The\nancient saying that the first maker of the Gods was fear receives\nvoluminous corroboration from every age of religious history; but none the\nless does religious history show the part which joy has evermore tended to\nplay. Sometimes the joy has been primary; sometimes secondary, being the\ngladness of deliverance from the fear. This latter state of things, being\nthe more complex, is also the more complete; and as we proceed, I think we\nshall have abundant reason for refusing to leave out either the sadness or\nthe gladness, if we look at religion with the breadth of view which it\ndemands. Stated in the completest possible terms, a man\u2019s religion\ninvolves both moods of contraction and moods of expansion of his being.\nBut the quantitative mixture and order of these moods vary so much from\none age of the world, from one system of thought, and from one individual\nto another, that you may insist either on the dread and the submission, or\non the peace and the freedom as the essence of the matter, and still\nremain materially within the limits of the truth. The constitutionally\nsombre and the constitutionally sanguine onlooker are bound to emphasize\nopposite aspects of what lies before their eyes.\nThe constitutionally sombre religious person makes even of his religious\npeace a very sober thing. Danger still hovers in the air about it. Flexion\nand contraction are not wholly checked. It were sparrowlike and childish\nafter our deliverance to explode into twittering laughter and caper\u2010\ncutting, and utterly to forget the imminent hawk on bough. Lie low,\nrather, lie low; for you are in the hands of a living God. In the Book of\nJob, for example, the impotence of man and the omnipotence of God is the\nexclusive burden of its author\u2019s mind. \u201cIt is as high as heaven; what\ncanst thou do?\u2014deeper than hell; what canst thou know?\u201d There is an\nastringent relish about the truth of this conviction which some men can\nfeel, and which for them is as near an approach as can be made to the\nfeeling of religious joy.\n\u201cIn Job,\u201d says that coldly truthful writer, the author of Mark\nRutherford, \u201cGod reminds us that man is not the measure of his\ncreation. The world is immense, constructed on no plan or theory\nwhich the intellect of man can grasp. It is _transcendent_\neverywhere. This is the burden of every verse, and is the secret,\nif there be one, of the poem. Sufficient or insufficient, there is\nnothing more.... God is great, we know not his ways. He takes from\nus all we have, but yet if we possess our souls in patience, we\n_may_ pass the valley of the shadow, and come out in sunlight\nagain. We may or we may not!... What more have we to say now than\nGod said from the whirlwind over two thousand five hundred years\nago?\u201d(30)\nIf we turn to the sanguine onlooker, on the other hand, we find that\ndeliverance is felt as incomplete unless the burden be altogether overcome\nand the danger forgotten. Such onlookers give us definitions that seem to\nthe sombre minds of whom we have just been speaking to leave out all the\nsolemnity that makes religious peace so different from merely animal joys.\nIn the opinion of some writers an attitude might be called religious,\nthough no touch were left in it of sacrifice or submission, no tendency to\nflexion, no bowing of the head. Any \u201chabitual and regulated admiration,\u201d\nsays Professor J. R. Seeley,(31) \u201cis worthy to be called a religion\u201d; and\naccordingly he thinks that our Music, our Science, and our so\u2010called\n\u201cCivilization,\u201d as these things are now organized and admiringly believed\nin, form the more genuine religions of our time. Certainly the\nunhesitating and unreasoning way in which we feel that we must inflict our\ncivilization upon \u201clower\u201d races, by means of Hotchkiss guns, etc., reminds\none of nothing so much as of the early spirit of Islam spreading its\nreligion by the sword.\nIn my last lecture I quoted to you the ultra\u2010radical opinion of Mr.\nHavelock Ellis, that laughter of any sort may be considered a religious\nexercise, for it bears witness to the soul\u2019s emancipation. I quoted this\nopinion in order to deny its adequacy. But we must now settle our scores\nmore carefully with this whole optimistic way of thinking. It is far too\ncomplex to be decided off\u2010hand. I propose accordingly that we make of\nreligious optimism the theme of the next two lectures.\nLECTURES IV AND V. THE RELIGION OF HEALTHY\u2010MINDEDNESS.\nIf we were to ask the question: \u201cWhat is human life\u2019s chief concern?\u201d one\nof the answers we should receive would be: \u201cIt is happiness.\u201d How to gain,\nhow to keep, how to recover happiness, is in fact for most men at all\ntimes the secret motive of all they do, and of all they are willing to\nendure. The hedonistic school in ethics deduces the moral life wholly from\nthe experiences of happiness and unhappiness which different kinds of\nconduct bring; and, even more in the religious life than in the moral\nlife, happiness and unhappiness seem to be the poles round which the\ninterest revolves. We need not go so far as to say with the author whom I\nlately quoted that any persistent enthusiasm is, as such, religion, nor\nneed we call mere laughter a religious exercise; but we must admit that\nany persistent enjoyment may _produce_ the sort of religion which consists\nin a grateful admiration of the gift of so happy an existence; and we must\nalso acknowledge that the more complex ways of experiencing religion are\nnew manners of producing happiness, wonderful inner paths to a\nsupernatural kind of happiness, when the first gift of natural existence\nis unhappy, as it so often proves itself to be.\nWith such relations between religion and happiness, it is perhaps not\nsurprising that men come to regard the happiness which a religious belief\naffords as a proof of its truth. If a creed makes a man feel happy, he\nalmost inevitably adopts it. Such a belief ought to be true; therefore it\nis true\u2014such, rightly or wrongly, is one of the \u201cimmediate inferences\u201d of\nthe religious logic used by ordinary men.\n\u201cThe near presence of God\u2019s spirit,\u201d says a German writer,(32)\n\u201cmay be experienced in its reality\u2014indeed _only_ experienced. And\nthe mark by which the spirit\u2019s existence and nearness are made\nirrefutably clear to those who have ever had the experience is the\nutterly incomparable _feeling of happiness_ which is connected\nwith the nearness, and which is therefore not only a possible and\naltogether proper feeling for us to have here below, but is the\nbest and most indispensable proof of God\u2019s reality. No other proof\nis equally convincing, and therefore happiness is the point from\nwhich every efficacious new theology should start.\u201d\nIn the hour immediately before us, I shall invite you to consider the\nsimpler kinds of religious happiness, leaving the more complex sorts to be\ntreated on a later day.\nIn many persons, happiness is congenital and irreclaimable. \u201cCosmic\nemotion\u201d inevitably takes in them the form of enthusiasm and freedom. I\nspeak not only of those who are animally happy. I mean those who, when\nunhappiness is offered or proposed to them, positively refuse to feel it,\nas if it were something mean and wrong. We find such persons in every age,\npassionately flinging themselves upon their sense of the goodness of life,\nin spite of the hardships of their own condition, and in spite of the\nsinister theologies into which they may be born. From the outset their\nreligion is one of union with the divine. The heretics who went before the\nreformation are lavishly accused by the church writers of antinomian\npractices, just as the first Christians were accused of indulgence in\norgies by the Romans. It is probable that there never has been a century\nin which the deliberate refusal to think ill of life has not been\nidealized by a sufficient number of persons to form sects, open or secret,\nwho claimed all natural things to be permitted. Saint Augustine\u2019s maxim,\n_Dilige et quod vis fac_,\u2014if you but love [God], you may do as you\nincline,\u2014is morally one of the profoundest of observations, yet it is\npregnant, for such persons, with passports beyond the bounds of\nconventional morality. According to their characters they have been\nrefined or gross; but their belief has been at all times systematic enough\nto constitute a definite religious attitude. God was for them a giver of\nfreedom, and the sting of evil was overcome. Saint Francis and his\nimmediate disciples were, on the whole, of this company of spirits, of\nwhich there are of course infinite varieties. Rousseau in the earlier\nyears of his writing, Diderot, B. de Saint Pierre, and many of the leaders\nof the eighteenth century anti\u2010christian movement were of this optimistic\ntype. They owed their influence to a certain authoritativeness in their\nfeeling that Nature, if you will only trust her sufficiently, is\nabsolutely good.\nIt is to be hoped that we all have some friend, perhaps more often\nfeminine than masculine, and young than old, whose soul is of this sky\u2010\nblue tint, whose affinities are rather with flowers and birds and all\nenchanting innocencies than with dark human passions, who can think no ill\nof man or God, and in whom religious gladness, being in possession from\nthe outset, needs no deliverance from any antecedent burden.\n\u201cGod has two families of children on this earth,\u201d says Francis W.\nNewman,(33) \u201c_the once\u2010born_ and _the twice\u2010born_,\u201d and the once\u2010\nborn he describes as follows: \u201cThey see God, not as a strict\nJudge, not as a Glorious Potentate; but as the animating Spirit of\na beautiful harmonious world, Beneficent and Kind, Merciful as\nwell as Pure. The same characters generally have no metaphysical\ntendencies: they do not look back into themselves. Hence they are\nnot distressed by their own imperfections: yet it would be absurd\nto call them self\u2010righteous; for they hardly think of themselves\n_at all_. This childlike quality of their nature makes the opening\nof religion very happy to them: for they no more shrink from God,\nthan a child from an emperor, before whom the parent trembles: in\nfact, they have no vivid conception of _any_ of the qualities in\nwhich the severer Majesty of God consists.(34) He is to them the\nimpersonation of Kindness and Beauty. They read his character, not\nin the disordered world of man, but in romantic and harmonious\nnature. Of human sin they know perhaps little in their own hearts\nand not very much in the world; and human suffering does but melt\nthem to tenderness. Thus, when they approach God, no inward\ndisturbance ensues; and without being as yet spiritual, they have\na certain complacency and perhaps romantic sense of excitement in\ntheir simple worship.\u201d\nIn the Romish Church such characters find a more congenial soil to grow in\nthan in Protestantism, whose fashions of feeling have been set by minds of\na decidedly pessimistic order. But even in Protestantism they have been\nabundant enough; and in its recent \u201cliberal\u201d developments of Unitarianism\nand latitudinarianism generally, minds of this order have played and still\nare playing leading and constructive parts. Emerson himself is an\nadmirable example. Theodore Parker is another,\u2014here are a couple of\ncharacteristic passages from Parker\u2019s correspondence.(35)\n\u201cOrthodox scholars say: \u2018In the heathen classics you find no\nconsciousness of sin.\u2019 It is very true\u2014God be thanked for it. They\nwere conscious of wrath, of cruelty, avarice, drunkenness, lust,\nsloth, cowardice, and other actual vices, and struggled and got\nrid of the deformities, but they were not conscious of \u2018enmity\nagainst God,\u2019 and didn\u2019t sit down and whine and groan against non\u2010\nexistent evil. I have done wrong things enough in my life, and do\nthem now; I miss the mark, draw bow, and try again. But I am not\nconscious of hating God, or man, or right, or love, and I know\nthere is much \u2018health in me\u2019; and in my body, even now, there\ndwelleth many a good thing, spite of consumption and Saint Paul.\u201d\nIn another letter Parker writes: \u201cI have swum in clear sweet\nwaters all my days; and if sometimes they were a little cold, and\nthe stream ran adverse and something rough, it was never too\nstrong to be breasted and swum through. From the days of earliest\nboyhood, when I went stumbling through the grass,... up to the\ngray\u2010bearded manhood of this time, there is none but has left me\nhoney in the hive of memory that I now feed on for present\ndelight. When I recall the years ... I am filled with a sense of\nsweetness and wonder that such little things can make a mortal so\nexceedingly rich. But I must confess that the chiefest of all my\ndelights is still the religious.\u201d\nAnother good expression of the \u201conce\u2010born\u201d type of consciousness,\ndeveloping straight and natural, with no element of morbid compunction or\ncrisis, is contained in the answer of Dr. Edward Everett Hale, the eminent\nUnitarian preacher and writer, to one of Dr. Starbuck\u2019s circulars. I quote\na part of it:\u2014\n\u201cI observe, with profound regret, the religious struggles which\ncome into many biographies, as if almost essential to the\nformation of the hero. I ought to speak of these, to say that any\nman has an advantage, not to be estimated, who is born, as I was,\ninto a family where the religion is simple and rational; who is\ntrained in the theory of such a religion, so that he never knows,\nfor an hour, what these religious or irreligious struggles are. I\nalways knew God loved me, and I was always grateful to him for the\nworld he placed me in. I always liked to tell him so, and was\nalways glad to receive his suggestions to me.... I can remember\nperfectly that when I was coming to manhood, the half\u2010\nphilosophical novels of the time had a deal to say about the young\nmen and maidens who were facing the \u2018problem of life.\u2019 I had no\nidea whatever what the problem of life was. To live with all my\nmight seemed to me easy; to learn where there was so much to learn\nseemed pleasant and almost of course; to lend a hand, if one had a\nchance, natural; and if one did this, why, he enjoyed life because\nhe could not help it, and without proving to himself that he ought\nto enjoy it.... A child who is early taught that he is God\u2019s\nchild, that he may live and move and have his being in God, and\nthat he has, therefore, infinite strength at hand for the\nconquering of any difficulty, will take life more easily, and\nprobably will make more of it, than one who is told that he is\nborn the child of wrath and wholly incapable of good.\u201d(36)\nOne can but recognize in such writers as these the presence of a\ntemperament organically weighted on the side of cheer and fatally\nforbidden to linger, as those of opposite temperament linger, over the\ndarker aspects of the universe. In some individuals optimism may become\nquasi\u2010pathological. The capacity for even a transient sadness or a\nmomentary humility seems cut off from them as by a kind of congenital\nan\u00e6sthesia.(37)\nThe supreme contemporary example of such an inability to feel evil is of\ncourse Walt Whitman.\n\u201cHis favorite occupation,\u201d writes his disciple, Dr. Bucke, \u201cseemed\nto be strolling or sauntering about outdoors by himself, looking\nat the grass, the trees, the flowers, the vistas of light, the\nvarying aspects of the sky, and listening to the birds, the\ncrickets, the tree frogs, and all the hundreds of natural sounds.\nIt was evident that these things gave him a pleasure far beyond\nwhat they give to ordinary people. Until I knew the man,\u201d\ncontinues Dr. Bucke, \u201cit had not occurred to me that any one could\nderive so much absolute happiness from these things as he did. He\nwas very fond of flowers, either wild or cultivated; liked all\nsorts. I think he admired lilacs and sunflowers just as much as\nroses. Perhaps, indeed, no man who ever lived liked so many things\nand disliked so few as Walt Whitman. All natural objects seemed to\nhave a charm for him. All sights and sounds seemed to please him.\nHe appeared to like (and I believe he did like) all the men,\nwomen, and children he saw (though I never knew him to say that he\nliked any one), but each who knew him felt that he liked him or\nher, and that he liked others also. I never knew him to argue or\ndispute, and he never spoke about money. He always justified,\nsometimes playfully, sometimes quite seriously, those who spoke\nharshly of himself or his writings, and I often thought he even\ntook pleasure in the opposition of enemies. When I first knew\n[him], I used to think that he watched himself, and would not\nallow his tongue to give expression to fretfulness, antipathy,\ncomplaint, and remonstrance. It did not occur to me as possible\nthat these mental states could be absent in him. After long\nobservation, however, I satisfied myself that such absence or\nunconsciousness was entirely real. He never spoke deprecatingly of\nany nationality or class of men, or time in the world\u2019s history,\nor against any trades or occupations\u2014not even against any animals,\ninsects, or inanimate things, nor any of the laws of nature, nor\nany of the results of those laws, such as illness, deformity, and\ndeath. He never complained or grumbled either at the weather,\npain, illness, or anything else. He never swore. He could not very\nwell, since he never spoke in anger and apparently never was\nangry. He never exhibited fear, and I do not believe he ever felt\nit.\u201d(38)\nWalt Whitman owes his importance in literature to the systematic expulsion\nfrom his writings of all contractile elements. The only sentiments he\nallowed himself to express were of the expansive order; and he expressed\nthese in the first person, not as your mere monstrously conceited\nindividual might so express them, but vicariously for all men, so that a\npassionate and mystic ontological emotion suffuses his words, and ends by\npersuading the reader that men and women, life and death, and all things\nare divinely good.\nThus it has come about that many persons to\u2010day regard Walt Whitman as the\nrestorer of the eternal natural religion. He has infected them with his\nown love of comrades, with his own gladness that he and they exist.\nSocieties are actually formed for his cult; a periodical organ exists for\nits propagation, in which the lines of orthodoxy and heterodoxy are\nalready beginning to be drawn;(39) hymns are written by others in his\npeculiar prosody; and he is even explicitly compared with the founder of\nthe Christian religion, not altogether to the advantage of the latter.\nWhitman is often spoken of as a \u201cpagan.\u201d The word nowadays means sometimes\nthe mere natural animal man without a sense of sin; sometimes it means a\nGreek or Roman with his own peculiar religious consciousness. In neither\nof these senses does it fitly define this poet. He is more than your mere\nanimal man who has not tasted of the tree of good and evil. He is aware\nenough of sin for a swagger to be present in his indifference towards it,\na conscious pride in his freedom from flexions and contractions, which\nyour genuine pagan in the first sense of the word would never show.\n\u201cI could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self\u2010\ncontained,\nI stand and look at them long and long;\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition.\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\nowning things,\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\nyears ago,\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\u201d(40)\nNo natural pagan could have written these well\u2010known lines. But on the\nother hand Whitman is less than a Greek or Roman; for their consciousness,\neven in Homeric times, was full to the brim of the sad mortality of this\nsunlit world, and such a consciousness Walt Whitman resolutely refuses to\nadopt. When, for example, Achilles, about to slay Lycaon, Priam\u2019s young\nson, hears him sue for mercy, he stops to say:\u2014\n\u201cAh, friend, thou too must die: why thus lamentest thou? Patroclos\ntoo is dead, who was better far than thou.... Over me too hang\ndeath and forceful fate. There cometh morn or eve or some noonday\nwhen my life too some man shall take in battle, whether with spear\nhe smite, or arrow from the string.\u201d(41)\nThen Achilles savagely severs the poor boy\u2019s neck with his sword, heaves\nhim by the foot into the Scamander, and calls to the fishes of the river\nto eat the white fat of Lycaon. Just as here the cruelty and the sympathy\neach ring true, and do not mix or interfere with one another, so did the\nGreeks and Romans keep all their sadnesses and gladnesses unmingled and\nentire. Instinctive good they did not reckon sin; nor had they any such\ndesire to save the credit of the universe as to make them insist, as so\nmany of _us_ insist, that what immediately appears as evil must be \u201cgood\nin the making,\u201d or something equally ingenious. Good was good, and bad\njust bad, for the earlier Greeks. They neither denied the ills of\nnature,\u2014Walt Whitman\u2019s verse, \u201cWhat is called good is perfect and what is\ncalled bad is just as perfect,\u201d would have been mere silliness to\nthem,\u2014nor did they, in order to escape from those ills, invent \u201canother\nand a better world\u201d of the imagination, in which, along with the ills, the\ninnocent goods of sense would also find no place. This integrity of the\ninstinctive reactions, this freedom from all moral sophistry and strain,\ngives a pathetic dignity to ancient pagan feeling. And this quality\nWhitman\u2019s outpourings have not got. His optimism is too voluntary and\ndefiant; his gospel has a touch of bravado and an affected twist,(42) and\nthis diminishes its effect on many readers who yet are well disposed\ntowards optimism, and on the whole quite willing to admit that in\nimportant respects Whitman is of the genuine lineage of the prophets.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIf, then, we give the name of healthy\u2010mindedness to the tendency which\nlooks on all things and sees that they are good, we find that we must\ndistinguish between a more involuntary and a more voluntary or systematic\nway of being healthy\u2010minded. In its involuntary variety, healthy\u2010\nmindedness is a way of feeling happy about things immediately. In its\nsystematical variety, it is an abstract way of conceiving things as good.\nEvery abstract way of conceiving things selects some one aspect of them as\ntheir essence for the time being, and disregards the other aspects.\nSystematic healthy\u2010mindedness, conceiving good as the essential and\nuniversal aspect of being, deliberately excludes evil from its field of\nvision; and although, when thus nakedly stated, this might seem a\ndifficult feat to perform for one who is intellectually sincere with\nhimself and honest about facts, a little reflection shows that the\nsituation is too complex to lie open to so simple a criticism.\nIn the first place, happiness, like every other emotional state, has\nblindness and insensibility to opposing facts given it as its instinctive\nweapon for self\u2010protection against disturbance. When happiness is actually\nin possession, the thought of evil can no more acquire the feeling of\nreality than the thought of good can gain reality when melancholy rules.\nTo the man actively happy, from whatever cause, evil simply cannot then\nand there be believed in. He must ignore it; and to the bystander he may\nthen seem perversely to shut his eyes to it and hush it up.\nBut more than this: the hushing of it up may, in a perfectly candid and\nhonest mind, grow into a deliberate religious policy, or _parti pris_.\nMuch of what we call evil is due entirely to the way men take the\nphenomenon. It can so often be converted into a bracing and tonic good by\na simple change of the sufferer\u2019s inner attitude from one of fear to one\nof fight; its sting so often departs and turns into a relish when, after\nvainly seeking to shun it, we agree to face about and bear it cheerfully,\nthat a man is simply bound in honor, with reference to many of the facts\nthat seem at first to disconcert his peace, to adopt this way of escape.\nRefuse to admit their badness; despise their power; ignore their presence;\nturn your attention the other way; and so far as you yourself are\nconcerned at any rate, though the facts may still exist, their evil\ncharacter exists no longer. Since you make them evil or good by your own\nthoughts about them, it is the ruling of your thoughts which proves to be\nyour principal concern.\nThe deliberate adoption of an optimistic turn of mind thus makes its\nentrance into philosophy. And once in, it is hard to trace its lawful\nbounds. Not only does the human instinct for happiness, bent on self\u2010\nprotection by ignoring, keep working in its favor, but higher inner ideals\nhave weighty words to say. The attitude of unhappiness is not only\npainful, it is mean and ugly. What can be more base and unworthy than the\npining, puling, mumping mood, no matter by what outward ills it may have\nbeen engendered? What is more injurious to others? What less helpful as a\nway out of the difficulty? It but fastens and perpetuates the trouble\nwhich occasioned it, and increases the total evil of the situation. At all\ncosts, then, we ought to reduce the sway of that mood; we ought to scout\nit in ourselves and others, and never show it tolerance. But it is\nimpossible to carry on this discipline in the subjective sphere without\nzealously emphasizing the brighter and minimizing the darker aspects of\nthe objective sphere of things at the same time. And thus our resolution\nnot to indulge in misery, beginning at a comparatively small point within\nourselves, may not stop until it has brought the entire frame of reality\nunder a systematic conception optimistic enough to be congenial with its\nneeds.\nIn all this I say nothing of any mystical insight or persuasion that the\ntotal frame of things absolutely must be good. Such mystical persuasion\nplays an enormous part in the history of the religious consciousness, and\nwe must look at it later with some care. But we need not go so far at\npresent. More ordinary non\u2010mystical conditions of rapture suffice for my\nimmediate contention. All invasive moral states and passionate enthusiasms\nmake one feelingless to evil in some direction. The common penalties cease\nto deter the patriot, the usual prudences are flung by the lover to the\nwinds. When the passion is extreme, suffering may actually be gloried in,\nprovided it be for the ideal cause, death may lose its sting, the grave\nits victory. In these states, the ordinary contrast of good and ill seems\nto be swallowed up in a higher denomination, an omnipotent excitement\nwhich engulfs the evil, and which the human being welcomes as the crowning\nexperience of his life. This, he says, is truly to live, and I exult in\nthe heroic opportunity and adventure.\nThe systematic cultivation of healthy\u2010mindedness as a religious attitude\nis therefore consonant with important currents in human nature, and is\nanything but absurd. In fact, we all do cultivate it more or less, even\nwhen our professed theology should in consistency forbid it. We divert our\nattention from disease and death as much as we can; and the slaughter\u2010\nhouses and indecencies without end on which our life is founded are\nhuddled out of sight and never mentioned, so that the world we recognize\nofficially in literature and in society is a poetic fiction far handsomer\nand cleaner and better than the world that really is.(43)\nThe advance of liberalism, so\u2010called, in Christianity, during the past\nfifty years, may fairly be called a victory of healthy\u2010mindedness within\nthe church over the morbidness with which the old hell\u2010fire theology was\nmore harmoniously related. We have now whole congregations whose\npreachers, far from magnifying our consciousness of sin, seem devoted\nrather to making little of it. They ignore, or even deny, eternal\npunishment, and insist on the dignity rather than on the depravity of man.\nThey look at the continual preoccupation of the old\u2010fashioned Christian\nwith the salvation of his soul as something sickly and reprehensible\nrather than admirable; and a sanguine and \u201cmuscular\u201d attitude, which to\nour forefathers would have seemed purely heathen, has become in their eyes\nan ideal element of Christian character. I am not asking whether or not\nthey are right, I am only pointing out the change.\nThe persons to whom I refer have still retained for the most part their\nnominal connection with Christianity, in spite of their discarding of its\nmore pessimistic theological elements. But in that \u201ctheory of evolution\u201d\nwhich, gathering momentum for a century, has within the past twenty\u2010five\nyears swept so rapidly over Europe and America, we see the ground laid for\na new sort of religion of Nature, which has entirely displaced\nChristianity from the thought of a large part of our generation. The idea\nof a universal evolution lends itself to a doctrine of general meliorism\nand progress which fits the religious needs of the healthy\u2010minded so well\nthat it seems almost as if it might have been created for their use.\nAccordingly we find \u201cevolutionism\u201d interpreted thus optimistically and\nembraced as a substitute for the religion they were born in, by a\nmultitude of our contemporaries who have either been trained\nscientifically, or been fond of reading popular science, and who had\nalready begun to be inwardly dissatisfied with what seemed to them the\nharshness and irrationality of the orthodox Christian scheme. As examples\nare better than descriptions, I will quote a document received in answer\nto Professor Starbuck\u2019s circular of questions. The writer\u2019s state of mind\nmay by courtesy be called a religion, for it is his reaction on the whole\nnature of things, it is systematic and reflective, and it loyally binds\nhim to certain inner ideals. I think you will recognize in him, coarse\u2010\nmeated and incapable of wounded spirit as he is, a sufficiently familiar\ncontemporary type.\nQ. _What does Religion mean to you?_\nA. It means nothing; and it seems, so far as I can observe,\nuseless to others. I am sixty\u2010seven years of age and have resided\nin X. fifty years, and have been in business forty\u2010five,\nconsequently I have some little experience of life and men, and\nsome women too, and I find that the most religious and pious\npeople are as a rule those most lacking in uprightness and\nmorality. The men who do not go to church or have any religious\nconvictions are the best. Praying, singing of hymns, and\nsermonizing are pernicious\u2014they teach us to rely on some\nsupernatural power, when we ought to rely on ourselves. I\n_tee_totally disbelieve in a God. The God\u2010idea was begotten in\nignorance, fear, and a general lack of any knowledge of Nature. If\nI were to die now, being in a healthy condition for my age, both\nmentally and physically, I would just as lief, yes, rather, die\nwith a hearty enjoyment of music, sport, or any other rational\npastime. As a timepiece stops, we die\u2014there being no immortality\nin either case.\nQ. _What comes before your mind corresponding to the words God,\nHeaven, Angels, etc.?_\nA. Nothing whatever. I am a man without a religion. These words\nmean so much mythic bosh.\nQ. _Have you had any experiences which appeared providential?_\nA. None whatever. There is no agency of the superintending kind. A\nlittle judicious observation as well as knowledge of scientific\nlaw will convince any one of this fact.\nQ. _What things work most strongly on your emotions?_\nA. Lively songs and music; Pinafore instead of an Oratorio. I like\nScott, Burns, Byron, Longfellow, especially Shakespeare, etc.,\netc. Of songs, the Star\u2010spangled Banner, America, Marseillaise,\nand all moral and soul\u2010stirring songs, but wishy\u2010washy hymns are\nmy detestation. I greatly enjoy nature, especially fine weather,\nand until within a few years used to walk Sundays into the\ncountry, twelve miles often, with no fatigue, and bicycle forty or\nfifty. I have dropped the bicycle. I never go to church, but\nattend lectures when there are any good ones. All of my thoughts\nand cogitations have been of a healthy and cheerful kind, for\ninstead of doubts and fears I see things as they are, for I\nendeavor to adjust myself to my environment. This I regard as the\ndeepest law. Mankind is a progressive animal. I am satisfied he\nwill have made a great advance over his present status a thousand\nyears hence.\nQ. _What is your notion of sin?_\nA. It seems to me that sin is a condition, a disease, incidental\nto man\u2019s development not being yet advanced enough. Morbidness\nover it increases the disease. We should think that a million of\nyears hence equity, justice, and mental and physical good order\nwill be so fixed and organized that no one will have any idea of\nevil or sin.\nQ. _What is your temperament?_\nA. Nervous, active, wide\u2010awake, mentally and physically. Sorry\nthat Nature compels us to sleep at all.\nIf we are in search of a broken and a contrite heart, clearly we need not\nlook to this brother. His contentment with the finite incases him like a\nlobster\u2010shell and shields him from all morbid repining at his distance\nfrom the Infinite. We have in him an excellent example of the optimism\nwhich may be encouraged by popular science.\nTo my mind a current far more important and interesting religiously than\nthat which sets in from natural science towards healthy\u2010mindedness is that\nwhich has recently poured over America and seems to be gathering force\nevery day,\u2014I am ignorant what foothold it may yet have acquired in Great\nBritain,\u2014and to which, for the sake of having a brief designation, I will\ngive the title of the \u201cMind\u2010cure movement.\u201d There are various sects of\nthis \u201cNew Thought,\u201d to use another of the names by which it calls itself;\nbut their agreements are so profound that their differences may be\nneglected for my present purpose, and I will treat the movement, without\napology, as if it were a simple thing.\nIt is a deliberately optimistic scheme of life, with both a speculative\nand a practical side. In its gradual development during the last quarter\nof a century, it has taken up into itself a number of contributory\nelements, and it must now be reckoned with as a genuine religious power.\nIt has reached the stage, for example, when the demand for its literature\nis great enough for insincere stuff, mechanically produced for the market,\nto be to a certain extent supplied by publishers,\u2014a phenomenon never\nobserved, I imagine, until a religion has got well past its earliest\ninsecure beginnings.\nOne of the doctrinal sources of Mind\u2010cure is the four Gospels; another is\nEmersonianism or New England transcendentalism; another is Berkeleyan\nidealism; another is spiritism, with its messages of \u201claw\u201d and \u201cprogress\u201d\nand \u201cdevelopment\u201d; another the optimistic popular science evolutionism of\nwhich I have recently spoken; and, finally, Hinduism has contributed a\nstrain. But the most characteristic feature of the mind\u2010cure movement is\nan inspiration much more direct. The leaders in this faith have had an\nintuitive belief in the all\u2010saving power of healthy\u2010minded attitudes as\nsuch, in the conquering efficacy of courage, hope, and trust, and a\ncorrelative contempt for doubt, fear, worry, and all nervously\nprecautionary states of mind.(44) Their belief has in a general way been\ncorroborated by the practical experience of their disciples; and this\nexperience forms to\u2010day a mass imposing in amount.\nThe blind have been made to see, the halt to walk; lifelong invalids have\nhad their health restored. The moral fruits have been no less remarkable.\nThe deliberate adoption of a healthy\u2010minded attitude has proved possible\nto many who never supposed they had it in them; regeneration of character\nhas gone on on an extensive scale; and cheerfulness has been restored to\ncountless homes. The indirect influence of this has been great. The mind\u2010\ncure principles are beginning so to pervade the air that one catches their\nspirit at second\u2010hand. One hears of the \u201cGospel of Relaxation,\u201d of the\n\u201cDon\u2019t Worry Movement,\u201d of people who repeat to themselves, \u201cYouth,\nhealth, vigor!\u201d when dressing in the morning, as their motto for the day.\nComplaints of the weather are getting to be forbidden in many households;\nand more and more people are recognizing it to be bad form to speak of\ndisagreeable sensations, or to make much of the ordinary inconveniences\nand ailments of life. These general tonic effects on public opinion would\nbe good even if the more striking results were non\u2010existent. But the\nlatter abound so that we can afford to overlook the innumerable failures\nand self\u2010deceptions that are mixed in with them (for in everything human\nfailure is a matter of course), and we can also overlook the verbiage of a\ngood deal of the mind\u2010cure literature, some of which is so moonstruck with\noptimism and so vaguely expressed that an academically trained intellect\nfinds it almost impossible to read it at all.\nThe plain fact remains that the spread of the movement has been due to\npractical fruits, and the extremely practical turn of character of the\nAmerican people has never been better shown than by the fact that this,\ntheir only decidedly original contribution to the systematic philosophy of\nlife, should be so intimately knit up with concrete therapeutics. To the\nimportance of mind\u2010cure the medical and clerical professions in the United\nStates are beginning, though with much recalcitrancy and protesting, to\nopen their eyes. It is evidently bound to develop still farther, both\nspeculatively and practically, and its latest writers are far and away the\nablest of the group.(45) It matters nothing that, just as there are hosts\nof persons who cannot pray, so there are greater hosts who cannot by any\npossibility be influenced by the mind\u2010curers\u2019 ideas. For our immediate\npurpose, the important point is that so large a number should exist who\n_can_ be so influenced. They form a psychic type to be studied with\nrespect.(46)\nTo come now to a little closer quarters with their creed. The fundamental\npillar on which it rests is nothing more than the general basis of all\nreligious experience, the fact that man has a dual nature, and is\nconnected with two spheres of thought, a shallower and a profounder\nsphere, in either of which he may learn to live more habitually. The\nshallower and lower sphere is that of the fleshly sensations, instincts,\nand desires, of egotism, doubt, and the lower personal interests. But\nwhereas Christian theology has always considered _frowardness_ to be the\nessential vice of this part of human nature, the mind\u2010curers say that the\nmark of the beast in it is _fear_; and this is what gives such an entirely\nnew religious turn to their persuasion.\n\u201cFear,\u201d to quote a writer of the school, \u201chas had its uses in the\nevolutionary process, and seems to constitute the whole of\nforethought in most animals; but that it should remain any part of\nthe mental equipment of human civilized life is an absurdity. I\nfind that the fear element of forethought is not stimulating to\nthose more civilized persons to whom duty and attraction are the\nnatural motives, but is weakening and deterrent. As soon as it\nbecomes unnecessary, fear becomes a positive deterrent, and should\nbe entirely removed, as dead flesh is removed from living tissue.\nTo assist in the analysis of fear, and in the denunciation of its\nexpressions, I have coined the word _fearthought_ to stand for the\nunprofitable element of forethought, and have defined the word\n\u2018worry\u2019 as _fearthought in contradistinction to forethought_. I\nhave also defined fearthought as _the self\u2010imposed or self\u2010\npermitted suggestion of inferiority_, in order to place it where\nit really belongs, in the category of harmful, unnecessary, and\ntherefore not respectable things.\u201d(47)\nThe \u201cmisery\u2010habit,\u201d the \u201cmartyr\u2010habit,\u201d engendered by the prevalent\n\u201cfearthought,\u201d get pungent criticism from the mind\u2010cure writers:\u2014\n\u201cConsider for a moment the habits of life into which we are born.\nThere are certain social conventions or customs and alleged\nrequirements, there is a theological bias, a general view of the\nworld. There are conservative ideas in regard to our early\ntraining, our education, marriage, and occupation in life.\nFollowing close upon this, there is a long series of\nanticipations, namely, that we shall suffer certain children\u2019s\ndiseases, diseases of middle life, and of old age; the thought\nthat we shall grow old, lose our faculties, and again become\nchildlike; while crowning all is the fear of death. Then there is\na long line of particular fears and trouble\u2010bearing expectations,\nsuch, for example, as ideas associated with certain articles of\nfood, the dread of the east wind, the terrors of hot weather, the\naches and pains associated with cold weather, the fear of catching\ncold if one sits in a draught, the coming of hay\u2010fever upon the\n14th of August in the middle of the day, and so on through a long\nlist of fears, dreads, worriments, anxieties, anticipations,\nexpectations, pessimisms, morbidities, and the whole ghostly train\nof fateful shapes which our fellow\u2010men, and especially physicians,\nare ready to help us conjure up, an array worthy to rank with\nBradley\u2019s \u2018unearthly ballet of bloodless categories.\u2019\n\u201cYet this is not all. This vast array is swelled by innumerable\nvolunteers from daily life,\u2014the fear of accident, the possibility\nof calamity, the loss of property, the chance of robbery, of fire,\nor the outbreak of war. And it is not deemed sufficient to fear\nfor ourselves. When a friend is taken ill, we must forthwith fear\nthe worst and apprehend death. If one meets with sorrow ...\nsympathy means to enter into and increase the suffering.\u201d(48)\n\u201cMan,\u201d to quote another writer, \u201coften has fear stamped upon him\nbefore his entrance into the outer world; he is reared in fear;\nall his life is passed in bondage to fear of disease and death,\nand thus his whole mentality becomes cramped, limited, and\ndepressed, and his body follows its shrunken pattern and\nspecification.... Think of the millions of sensitive and\nresponsive souls among our ancestors who have been under the\ndominion of such a perpetual nightmare! Is it not surprising that\nhealth exists at all? Nothing but the boundless divine love,\nexuberance, and vitality, constantly poured in, even though\nunconsciously to us, could in some degree neutralize such an ocean\nof morbidity.\u201d(49)\nAlthough the disciples of the mind\u2010cure often use Christian terminology,\none sees from such quotations how widely their notion of the fall of man\ndiverges from that of ordinary Christians.(50)\nTheir notion of man\u2019s higher nature is hardly less divergent, being\ndecidedly pantheistic. The spiritual in man appears in the mind\u2010cure\nphilosophy as partly conscious, but chiefly subconscious; and through the\nsubconscious part of it we are already one with the Divine without any\nmiracle of grace, or abrupt creation of a new inner man. As this view is\nvariously expressed by different writers, we find in it traces of\nChristian mysticism, of transcendental idealism, of vedantism, and of the\nmodern psychology of the subliminal self. A quotation or two will put us\nat the central point of view:\u2014\n\u201cThe great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite\nlife and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and\nthrough all. This spirit of infinite life and power that is back\nof all is what I call God. I care not what term you may use, be it\nKindly Light, Providence, the Over\u2010Soul, Omnipotence, or whatever\nterm may be most convenient, so long as we are agreed in regard to\nthe great central fact itself. God then fills the universe alone,\nso that all is from Him and in Him, and there is nothing that is\noutside. He is the life of our life, our very life itself. We are\npartakers of the life of God; and though we differ from Him in\nthat we are individualized spirits, while He is the Infinite\nSpirit, including us, as well as all else beside, yet in essence\nthe life of God and the life of man are identically the same, and\nso are one. They differ not in essence or quality; they differ in\ndegree.\n\u201cThe great central fact in human life is the coming into a\nconscious vital realization of our oneness with this Infinite\nLife, and the opening of ourselves fully to this divine inflow. In\njust the degree that we come into a conscious realization of our\noneness with the Infinite Life, and open ourselves to this divine\ninflow, do we actualize in ourselves the qualities and powers of\nthe Infinite Life, do we make ourselves channels through which the\nInfinite Intelligence and Power can work. In just the degree in\nwhich you realize your oneness with the Infinite Spirit, you will\nexchange dis\u2010ease for ease, inharmony for harmony, suffering and\npain for abounding health and strength. To recognize our own\ndivinity, and our intimate relation to the Universal, is to attach\nthe belts of our machinery to the powerhouse of the Universe. One\nneed remain in hell no longer than one chooses to; we can rise to\nany heaven we ourselves choose; and when we choose so to rise, all\nthe higher powers of the Universe combine to help us\nheavenward.\u201d(51)\nLet me now pass from these abstracter statements to some more concrete\naccounts of experience with the mind\u2010cure religion. I have many answers\nfrom correspondents\u2014the only difficulty is to choose. The first two whom I\nshall quote are my personal friends. One of them, a woman, writing as\nfollows, expresses well the feeling of continuity with the Infinite Power,\nby which all mind\u2010cure disciples are inspired.\n\u201cThe first underlying cause of all sickness, weakness, or\ndepression is the _human sense of separateness_ from that Divine\nEnergy which we call God. The soul which can feel and affirm in\nserene but jubilant confidence, as did the Nazarene: \u2018I and my\nFather are one,\u2019 has no further need of healer, or of healing.\nThis is the whole truth in a nutshell, and other foundation for\nwholeness can no man lay than this fact of impregnable divine\nunion. Disease can no longer attack one whose feet are planted on\nthis rock, who feels hourly, momently, the influx of the Deific\nBreath. If one with Omnipotence, how can weariness enter the\nconsciousness, how illness assail that indomitable spark?\n\u201cThis possibility of annulling forever the law of fatigue has been\nabundantly proven in my own case; for my earlier life bears a\nrecord of many, many years of bedridden invalidism, with spine and\nlower limbs paralyzed. My thoughts were no more impure than they\nare to\u2010day, although my belief in the necessity of illness was\ndense and unenlightened; but since my resurrection in the flesh, I\nhave worked as a healer unceasingly for fourteen years without a\nvacation, and can truthfully assert that I have never known a\nmoment of fatigue or pain, although coming in touch constantly\nwith excessive weakness, illness, and disease of all kinds. For\nhow can a conscious part of Deity be sick?\u2014since \u2018Greater is he\nthat is _with_ us than all that can strive against us.\u2019 \u201d\nMy second correspondent, also a woman, sends me the following statement:\u2014\n\u201cLife seemed difficult to me at one time. I was always breaking\ndown, and had several attacks of what is called nervous\nprostration, with terrible insomnia, being on the verge of\ninsanity; besides having many other troubles, especially of the\ndigestive organs. I had been sent away from home in charge of\ndoctors, had taken all the narcotics, stopped all work, been fed\nup, and in fact knew all the doctors within reach. But I never\nrecovered permanently till this New Thought took possession of me.\n\u201cI think that the one thing which impressed me most was learning\nthe fact that we must be in absolutely constant relation or mental\ntouch (this word is to me very expressive) with that essence of\nlife which permeates all and which we call God. This is almost\nunrecognizable unless we live it into ourselves _actually_, that\nis, by a constant turning to the very innermost, deepest\nconsciousness of our real selves or of God in us, for illumination\nfrom within, just as we turn to the sun for light, warmth, and\ninvigoration without. When you do this consciously, realizing that\nto turn inward to the light within you is to live in the presence\nof God or your divine self, you soon discover the unreality of the\nobjects to which you have hitherto been turning and which have\nengrossed you without.\n\u201cI have come to disregard the meaning of this attitude for bodily\nhealth _as such_, because that comes of itself, as an incidental\nresult, and cannot be found by any special mental act or desire to\nhave it, beyond that general attitude of mind I have referred to\nabove. That which we usually make the object of life, those outer\nthings we are all so wildly seeking, which we so often live and\ndie for, but which then do not give us peace and happiness, they\nshould all come of themselves as accessory, and as the mere\noutcome or natural result of a far higher life sunk deep in the\nbosom of the spirit. This life is the real seeking of the kingdom\nof God, the desire for his supremacy in our hearts, so that all\nelse comes as that which shall be \u2018added unto you\u2019\u2014as quite\nincidental and as a surprise to us, perhaps; and yet it is the\nproof of the reality of the perfect poise in the very centre of\nour being.\n\u201cWhen I say that we commonly make the object of our life that\nwhich we should not work for primarily, I mean many things which\nthe world considers praiseworthy and excellent, such as success in\nbusiness, fame as author or artist, physician or lawyer, or renown\nin philanthropic undertakings. Such things should be results, not\nobjects. I would also include pleasures of many kinds which seem\nharmless and good at the time, and are pursued because many accept\nthem\u2014I mean conventionalities, sociabilities, and fashions in\ntheir various development, these being mostly approved by the\nmasses, although they may be unreal, and even unhealthy\nsuperfluities.\u201d\nHere is another case, more concrete, also that of a woman. I read you\nthese cases without comment,\u2014they express so many varieties of the state\nof mind we are studying.\n\u201cI had been a sufferer from my childhood till my fortieth year.\n[Details of ill\u2010health are given which I omit.] I had been in\nVermont several months hoping for good from the change of air, but\nsteadily growing weaker, when one day during the latter part of\nOctober, while resting in the afternoon, I suddenly heard as it\nwere these words: \u2018You will be healed and do a work you never\ndreamed of.\u2019 These words were impressed upon my mind with such\npower I said at once that only God could have put them there. I\nbelieved them in spite of myself and of my suffering and weakness,\nwhich continued until Christmas, when I returned to Boston. Within\ntwo days a young friend offered to take me to a mental healer\n(this was January 7, 1881). The healer said: \u2018There is nothing but\nMind; we are expressions of the One Mind; body is only a mortal\nbelief; as a man thinketh so is he.\u2019 I could not accept all she\nsaid, but I translated all that was there for _me_ in this way:\n\u2018There is nothing but God; I am created by Him, and am absolutely\ndependent upon Him; mind is given me to use; and by just so much\nof it as I will put upon the thought of right action in body I\nshall be lifted out of bondage to my ignorance and fear and past\nexperience.\u2019 That day I commenced accordingly to take a little of\nevery food provided for the family, constantly saying to myself:\n\u2018The Power that created the stomach must take care of what I have\neaten.\u2019 By holding these suggestions through the evening I went to\nbed and fell asleep, saying: \u2018I am soul, spirit, just one with\nGod\u2019s Thought of me,\u2019 and slept all night without waking, for the\nfirst time in several years [the distress\u2010turns had usually\nrecurred about two o\u2019clock in the night]. I felt the next day like\nan escaped prisoner, and believed I had found the secret that\nwould in time give me perfect health. Within ten days I was able\nto eat anything provided for others, and after two weeks I began\nto have my own positive mental suggestions of Truth, which were to\nme like stepping\u2010stones. I will note a few of them; they came\nabout two weeks apart.\n\u201c1st. I am Soul, therefore it is well with me.\n\u201c2d. I am Soul, therefore I _am_ well.\n\u201c3d. A sort of inner vision of myself as a four\u2010footed beast with\na protuberance on every part of my body where I had suffering,\nwith my own face, begging me to acknowledge it as myself. I\nresolutely fixed my attention on being well, and refused to even\nlook at my old self in this form.\n\u201c4th. Again the vision of the beast far in the background, with\nfaint voice. Again refusal to acknowledge.\n\u201c5th. Once more the vision, but only of my eyes with the longing\nlook; and again the refusal. Then came the conviction, the inner\nconsciousness, that I was perfectly well and always had been, for\nI was Soul, an expression of God\u2019s Perfect Thought. That was to me\nthe perfect and completed separation between what I was and what I\nappeared to be. I succeeded in never losing sight after this of my\nreal being, by constantly affirming this truth, and by degrees\n(though it took me two years of hard work to get there) _I\nexpressed health continuously throughout my whole body_.\n\u201cIn my subsequent nineteen years\u2019 experience I have never known\nthis Truth to fail when I applied it, though in my ignorance I\nhave often failed to apply it, but through my failures I have\nlearned the simplicity and trustfulness of the little child.\u201d\nBut I fear that I risk tiring you by so many examples, and I must lead you\nback to philosophic generalities again. You see already by such records of\nexperience how impossible it is not to class mind\u2010cure as primarily a\nreligious movement. Its doctrine of the oneness of our life with God\u2019s\nlife is in fact quite indistinguishable from an interpretation of Christ\u2019s\nmessage which in these very Gifford lectures has been defended by some of\nyour very ablest Scottish religious philosophers.(52)\nBut philosophers usually profess to give a quasi\u2010logical explanation of\nthe existence of evil, whereas of the general fact of evil in the world,\nthe existence of the selfish, suffering, timorous finite consciousness,\nthe mind\u2010curers, so far as I am acquainted with them, profess to give no\nspeculative explanation. Evil is empirically there for them as it is for\neverybody, but the practical point of view predominates, and it would ill\nagree with the spirit of their system to spend time in worrying over it as\na \u201cmystery\u201d or \u201cproblem,\u201d or in \u201claying to heart\u201d the lesson of its\nexperience, after the manner of the Evangelicals. Don\u2019t reason about it,\nas Dante says, but give a glance and pass beyond! It is Avidhya,\nignorance! something merely to be outgrown and left behind, transcended\nand forgotten. Christian Science so\u2010called, the sect of Mrs. Eddy, is the\nmost radical branch of mind\u2010cure in its dealings with evil. For it evil is\nsimply a _lie_, and any one who mentions it is a liar. The optimistic\nideal of duty forbids us to pay it the compliment even of explicit\nattention. Of course, as our next lectures will show us, this is a bad\nspeculative omission, but it is intimately linked with the practical\nmerits of the system we are examining. Why regret a philosophy of evil, a\nmind\u2010curer would ask us, if I can put you in possession of a life of good?\nAfter all, it is the life that tells; and mind\u2010cure has developed a living\nsystem of mental hygiene which may well claim to have thrown all previous\nliterature of the _Di\u00e4tetik der Seele_ into the shade. This system is\nwholly and exclusively compacted of optimism: \u201cPessimism leads to\nweakness. Optimism leads to power.\u201d \u201cThoughts are things,\u201d as one of the\nmost vigorous mind\u2010cure writers prints in bold type at the bottom of each\nof his pages; and if your thoughts are of health, youth, vigor, and\nsuccess, before you know it these things will also be your outward\nportion. No one can fail of the regenerative influence of optimistic\nthinking, pertinaciously pursued. Every man owns indefeasibly this inlet\nto the divine. Fear, on the contrary, and all the contracted and egoistic\nmodes of thought, are inlets to destruction. Most mind\u2010curers here bring\nin a doctrine that thoughts are \u201cforces,\u201d and that, by virtue of a law\nthat like attracts like, one man\u2019s thoughts draw to themselves as allies\nall the thoughts of the same character that exist the world over. Thus one\ngets, by one\u2019s thinking, reinforcements from elsewhere for the realization\nof one\u2019s desires; and the great point in the conduct of life is to get the\nheavenly forces on one\u2019s side by opening one\u2019s own mind to their influx.\nOn the whole, one is struck by a psychological similarity between the\nmind\u2010cure movement and the Lutheran and Wesleyan movements. To the\nbeliever in moralism and works, with his anxious query, \u201cWhat shall I do\nto be saved?\u201d Luther and Wesley replied: \u201cYou are saved now, if you would\nbut believe it.\u201d And the mind\u2010curers come with precisely similar words of\nemancipation. They speak, it is true, to persons for whom the conception\nof salvation has lost its ancient theological meaning, but who labor\nnevertheless with the same eternal human difficulty. _Things are wrong\nwith them_; and \u201cWhat shall I do to be clear, right, sound, whole, well?\u201d\nis the form of their question. And the answer is: \u201cYou _are_ well, sound,\nand clear already, if you did but know it.\u201d \u201cThe whole matter may be\nsummed up in one sentence,\u201d says one of the authors whom I have already\nquoted, \u201c_God is well, and so are you_. You must awaken to the knowledge\nof your real being.\u201d\nThe adequacy of their message to the mental needs of a large fraction of\nmankind is what gave force to those earlier gospels. Exactly the same\nadequacy holds in the case of the mind\u2010cure message, foolish as it may\nsound upon its surface; and seeing its rapid growth in influence, and its\ntherapeutic triumphs, one is tempted to ask whether it may not be destined\n(probably by very reason of the crudity and extravagance of many of its\nmanifestations(53)) to play a part almost as great in the evolution of the\npopular religion of the future as did those earlier movements in their\nday.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut I here fear that I may begin to \u201cjar upon the nerves\u201d of some of the\nmembers of this academic audience. Such contemporary vagaries, you may\nthink, should hardly take so large a place in dignified Gifford lectures.\nI can only beseech you to have patience. The whole outcome of these\nlectures will, I imagine, be the emphasizing to your mind of the enormous\ndiversities which the spiritual lives of different men exhibit. Their\nwants, their susceptibilities, and their capacities all vary and must be\nclassed under different heads. The result is that we have really different\ntypes of religious experience; and, seeking in these lectures closer\nacquaintance with the healthy\u2010minded type, we must take it where we find\nit in most radical form. The psychology of individual types of character\nhas hardly begun even to be sketched as yet\u2014our lectures may possibly\nserve as a crumb\u2010like contribution to the structure. The first thing to\nbear in mind (especially if we ourselves belong to the clerico\u2010academic\u2010\nscientific type, the officially and conventionally \u201ccorrect\u201d type, \u201cthe\ndeadly respectable\u201d type, for which to ignore others is a besetting\ntemptation) is that nothing can be more stupid than to bar out phenomena\nfrom our notice, merely because we are incapable of taking part in\nanything like them ourselves.\nNow the history of Lutheran salvation by faith, of methodistic\nconversions, and of what I call the mind\u2010cure movement seems to prove the\nexistence of numerous persons in whom\u2014at any rate at a certain stage in\ntheir development\u2014a change of character for the better, so far from being\nfacilitated by the rules laid down by official moralists, will take place\nall the more successfully if those rules be exactly reversed. Official\nmoralists advise us never to relax our strenuousness. \u201cBe vigilant, day\nand night,\u201d they adjure us; \u201chold your passive tendencies in check; shrink\nfrom no effort; keep your will like a bow always bent.\u201d But the persons I\nspeak of find that all this conscious effort leads to nothing but failure\nand vexation in their hands, and only makes them two\u2010fold more the\nchildren of hell they were before. The tense and voluntary attitude\nbecomes in them an impossible fever and torment. Their machinery refuses\nto run at all when the bearings are made so hot and the belts so tight.\nUnder these circumstances the way to success, as vouched for by\ninnumerable authentic personal narrations, is by an anti\u2010moralistic\nmethod, by the \u201csurrender\u201d of which I spoke in my second lecture.\nPassivity, not activity; relaxation, not intentness, should be now the\nrule. Give up the feeling of responsibility, let go your hold, resign the\ncare of your destiny to higher powers, be genuinely indifferent as to what\nbecomes of it all, and you will find not only that you gain a perfect\ninward relief, but often also, in addition, the particular goods you\nsincerely thought you were renouncing. This is the salvation through self\u2010\ndespair, the dying to be truly born, of Lutheran theology, the passage\ninto _nothing_ of which Jacob Behmen writes. To get to it, a critical\npoint must usually be passed, a corner turned within one. Something must\ngive way, a native hardness must break down and liquefy; and this event\n(as we shall abundantly see hereafter) is frequently sudden and automatic,\nand leaves on the Subject an impression that he has been wrought on by an\nexternal power.\nWhatever its ultimate significance may prove to be, this is certainly one\nfundamental form of human experience. Some say that the capacity or\nincapacity for it is what divides the religious from the merely moralistic\ncharacter. With those who undergo it in its fullness, no criticism avails\nto cast doubt on its reality. They _know_; for they have actually _felt_\nthe higher powers, in giving up the tension of their personal will.\nA story which revivalist preachers often tell is that of a man who found\nhimself at night slipping down the side of a precipice. At last he caught\na branch which stopped his fall, and remained clinging to it in misery for\nhours. But finally his fingers had to loose their hold, and with a\ndespairing farewell to life, he let himself drop. He fell just six inches.\nIf he had given up the struggle earlier, his agony would have been spared.\nAs the mother earth received him, so, the preachers tell us, will the\neverlasting arms receive _us_ if we confide absolutely in them, and give\nup the hereditary habit of relying on our personal strength, with its\nprecautions that cannot shelter and safeguards that never save.\nThe mind\u2010curers have given the widest scope to this sort of experience.\nThey have demonstrated that a form of regeneration by relaxing, by letting\ngo, psychologically indistinguishable from the Lutheran justification by\nfaith and the Wesleyan acceptance of free grace, is within the reach of\npersons who have no conviction of sin and care nothing for the Lutheran\ntheology. It is but giving your little private convulsive self a rest, and\nfinding that a greater Self is there. The results, slow or sudden, or\ngreat or small, of the combined optimism and expectancy, the regenerative\nphenomena which ensue on the abandonment of effort, remain firm facts of\nhuman nature, no matter whether we adopt a theistic, a pantheistic\u2010\nidealistic, or a medical\u2010materialistic view of their ultimate causal\nexplanation.(54)\nWhen we take up the phenomena of revivalistic conversion, we shall learn\nsomething more about all this. Meanwhile I will say a brief word about the\nmind\u2010curer\u2019s _methods_.\nThey are of course largely suggestive. The suggestive influence of\nenvironment plays an enormous part in all spiritual education. But the\nword \u201csuggestion,\u201d having acquired official status, is unfortunately\nalready beginning to play in many quarters the part of a wet blanket upon\ninvestigation, being used to fend off all inquiry into the varying\nsusceptibilities of individual cases. \u201cSuggestion\u201d is only another name\nfor the power of ideas, _so far as they prove efficacious over belief and\nconduct_. Ideas efficacious over some people prove inefficacious over\nothers. Ideas efficacious at some times and in some human surroundings are\nnot so at other times and elsewhere. The ideas of Christian churches are\nnot efficacious in the therapeutic direction to\u2010day, whatever they may\nhave been in earlier centuries; and when the whole question is as to why\nthe salt has lost its savor here or gained it there, the mere blank waving\nof the word \u201csuggestion\u201d as if it were a banner gives no light. Dr.\nGoddard, whose candid psychological essay on Faith Cures ascribes them to\nnothing but ordinary suggestion, concludes by saying that \u201cReligion [and\nby this he seems to mean our popular Christianity] has in it all there is\nin mental therapeutics, and has it in its best form. Living up to [our\nreligious] ideas will do anything for us that can be done.\u201d And this in\nspite of the actual fact that the popular Christianity does absolutely\n_nothing_, or did nothing until mind\u2010cure came to the rescue.(55)\nAn idea, to be suggestive, must come to the individual with the force of a\nrevelation. The mind\u2010cure with its gospel of healthy\u2010mindedness has come\nas a revelation to many whose hearts the church Christianity had left\nhardened. It has let loose their springs of higher life. In what can the\noriginality of any religious movement consist, save in finding a channel,\nuntil then sealed up, through which those springs may be set free in some\ngroup of human beings?\nThe force of personal faith, enthusiasm, and example, and above all the\nforce of novelty, are always the prime suggestive agency in this kind of\nsuccess. If mind\u2010cure should ever become official, respectable, and\nintrenched, these elements of suggestive efficacy will be lost. In its\nacuter stages every religion must be a homeless Arab of the desert. The\nchurch knows this well enough, with its everlasting inner struggle of the\nacute religion of the few against the chronic religion of the many,\nindurated into an obstructiveness worse than that which irreligion opposes\nto the movings of the Spirit. \u201cWe may pray,\u201d says Jonathan Edwards,\n\u201cconcerning all those saints that are not lively Christians, that they may\neither be enlivened, or taken away; if that be true that is often said by\nsome at this day, that these cold dead saints do more hurt than natural\nmen, and lead more souls to hell, and that it would be well for mankind if\nthey were all dead.\u201d(56)\nThe next condition of success is the apparent existence, in large numbers,\nof minds who unite healthy\u2010mindedness with readiness for regeneration by\nletting go. Protestantism has been too pessimistic as regards the natural\nman, Catholicism has been too legalistic and moralistic, for either the\none or the other to appeal in any generous way to the type of character\nformed of this peculiar mingling of elements. However few of us here\npresent may belong to such a type, it is now evident that it forms a\nspecific moral combination, well represented in the world.\nFinally, mind\u2010cure has made what in our protestant countries is an\nunprecedentedly great use of the subconscious life. To their reasoned\nadvice and dogmatic assertion, its founders have added systematic exercise\nin passive relaxation, concentration, and meditation, and have even\ninvoked something like hypnotic practice. I quote some passages at\nrandom:\u2014\n\u201cThe value, the potency of ideals is the great practical truth on\nwhich the New Thought most strongly insists,\u2014the development\nnamely from within outward, from small to great.(57) Consequently\none\u2019s thought should be centred on the ideal outcome, even though\nthis trust be literally like a step in the dark.(58) To attain the\nability thus effectively to direct the mind, the New Thought\nadvises the practice of concentration, or in other words, the\nattainment of self\u2010control. One is to learn to marshal the\ntendencies of the mind, so that they may be held together as a\nunit by the chosen ideal. To this end, one should set apart times\nfor silent meditation, by one\u2019s self, preferably in a room where\nthe surroundings are favorable to spiritual thought. In New\nThought terms, this is called \u2018entering the silence.\u2019 \u201d(59)\n\u201cThe time will come when in the busy office or on the noisy street\nyou can enter into the silence by simply drawing the mantle of\nyour own thoughts about you and realizing that there and\neverywhere the Spirit of Infinite Life, Love, Wisdom, Peace,\nPower, and Plenty is guiding, keeping, protecting, leading you.\nThis is the spirit of continual prayer.(60) One of the most\nintuitive men we ever met had a desk at a city office where\nseveral other gentlemen were doing business constantly, and often\ntalking loudly. Entirely undisturbed by the many various sounds\nabout him, this self\u2010centred faithful man would, in any moment of\nperplexity, draw the curtains of privacy so completely about him\nthat he would be as fully inclosed in his own psychic aura, and\nthereby as effectually removed from all distractions, as though he\nwere alone in some primeval wood. Taking his difficulty with him\ninto the mystic silence in the form of a direct question, to which\nhe expected a certain answer, he would remain utterly passive\nuntil the reply came, and never once through many years\u2019\nexperience did he find himself disappointed or misled.\u201d(61)\nWherein, I should like to know, does this _intrinsically_ differ from the\npractice of \u201crecollection\u201d which plays so great a part in Catholic\ndiscipline? Otherwise called the practice of the presence of God (and so\nknown among ourselves, as for instance in Jeremy Taylor), it is thus\ndefined by the eminent teacher Alvarez de Paz in his work on\nContemplation.\n\u201cIt is the recollection of God, the thought of God, which in all\nplaces and circumstances makes us see him present, lets us commune\nrespectfully and lovingly with him, and fills us with desire and\naffection for him.... Would you escape from every ill? Never lose\nthis recollection of God, neither in prosperity nor in adversity,\nnor on any occasion whichsoever it be. Invoke not, to excuse\nyourself from this duty, either the difficulty or the importance\nof your business, for you can always remember that God sees you,\nthat you are under his eye. If a thousand times an hour you forget\nhim, reanimate a thousand times the recollection. If you cannot\npractice this exercise continuously, at least make yourself as\nfamiliar with it as possible; and, like unto those who in a\nrigorous winter draw near the fire as often as they can, go as\noften as you can to that ardent fire which will warm your\nsoul.\u201d(62)\nAll the external associations of the Catholic discipline are of course\nunlike anything in mind\u2010cure thought, but the purely spiritual part of the\nexercise is identical in both communions, and in both communions those who\nurge it write with authority, for they have evidently experienced in their\nown persons that whereof they tell. Compare again some mind\u2010cure\nutterances:\u2014\n\u201cHigh, healthful, pure thinking can be encouraged, promoted, and\nstrengthened. Its current can be turned upon grand ideals until it\nforms a habit and wears a channel. By means of such discipline the\nmental horizon can be flooded with the sunshine of beauty,\nwholeness, and harmony. To inaugurate pure and lofty thinking may\nat first seem difficult, even almost mechanical, but perseverance\nwill at length render it easy, then pleasant, and finally\ndelightful.\n\u201cThe soul\u2019s real world is that which it has built of its thoughts,\nmental states, and imaginations. If we _will_, we can turn our\nbacks upon the lower and sensuous plane, and lift ourselves into\nthe realm of the spiritual and Real, and there gain a residence.\nThe assumption of states of expectancy and receptivity will\nattract spiritual sunshine, and it will flow in as naturally as\nair inclines to a vacuum.... Whenever the thought is not occupied\nwith one\u2019s daily duty or profession, it should be sent aloft into\nthe spiritual atmosphere. There are quiet leisure moments by day,\nand wakeful hours at night, when this wholesome and delightful\nexercise may be engaged in to great advantage. If one who has\nnever made any systematic effort to lift and control the thought\u2010\nforces will, for a single month, earnestly pursue the course here\nsuggested, he will be surprised and delighted at the result, and\nnothing will induce him to go back to careless, aimless, and\nsuperficial thinking. At such favorable seasons the outside world,\nwith all its current of daily events, is barred out, and one goes\ninto the silent sanctuary of the inner temple of soul to commune\nand aspire. The spiritual hearing becomes delicately sensitive, so\nthat the \u2018still, small voice\u2019 is audible, the tumultuous waves of\nexternal sense are hushed, and there is a great calm. The ego\ngradually becomes conscious that it is face to face with the\nDivine Presence; that mighty, healing, loving, Fatherly life which\nis nearer to us than we are to ourselves. There is soul\u2010contact\nwith the Parent\u2010Soul, and an influx of life, love, virtue, health,\nand happiness from the Inexhaustible Fountain.\u201d(63)\nWhen we reach the subject of mysticism, you will undergo so deep an\nimmersion into these exalted states of consciousness as to be wet all\nover, if I may so express myself; and the cold shiver of doubt with which\nthis little sprinkling may affect you will have long since passed\naway\u2014doubt, I mean, as to whether all such writing be not mere abstract\ntalk and rhetoric set down _pour encourager les autres_. You will then be\nconvinced, I trust, that these states of consciousness of \u201cunion\u201d form a\nperfectly definite class of experiences, of which the soul may\noccasionally partake, and which certain persons may live by in a deeper\nsense than they live by anything else with which they have acquaintance.\nThis brings me to a general philosophical reflection with which I should\nlike to pass from the subject of healthy\u2010mindedness, and close a topic\nwhich I fear is already only too long drawn out. It concerns the relation\nof all this systematized healthy\u2010mindedness and mind\u2010cure religion to\nscientific method and the scientific life.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn a later lecture I shall have to treat explicitly of the relation of\nreligion to science on the one hand, and to primeval savage thought on the\nother. There are plenty of persons to\u2010day\u2014\u201cscientists\u201d or \u201cpositivists,\u201d\nthey are fond of calling themselves\u2014who will tell you that religious\nthought is a mere survival, an atavistic reversion to a type of\nconsciousness which humanity in its more enlightened examples has long\nsince left behind and outgrown. If you ask them to explain themselves more\nfully, they will probably say that for primitive thought everything is\nconceived of under the form of personality. The savage thinks that things\noperate by personal forces, and for the sake of individual ends. For him,\neven external nature obeys individual needs and claims, just as if these\nwere so many elementary powers. Now science, on the other hand, these\npositivists say, has proved that personality, so far from being an\nelementary force in nature, is but a passive resultant of the really\nelementary forces, physical, chemical, physiological, and psycho\u2010physical,\nwhich are all impersonal and general in character. Nothing individual\naccomplishes anything in the universe save in so far as it obeys and\nexemplifies some universal law. Should you then inquire of them by what\nmeans science has thus supplanted primitive thought, and discredited its\npersonal way of looking at things, they would undoubtedly say it has been\nby the strict use of the method of experimental verification. Follow out\nscience\u2019s conceptions practically, they will say, the conceptions that\nignore personality altogether, and you will always be corroborated. The\nworld is so made that all your expectations will be experientially\nverified so long, and only so long, as you keep the terms from which you\ninfer them impersonal and universal.\nBut here we have mind\u2010cure, with her diametrically opposite philosophy,\nsetting up an exactly identical claim. Live as if I were true, she says,\nand every day will practically prove you right. That the controlling\nenergies of nature are personal, that your own personal thoughts are\nforces, that the powers of the universe will directly respond to your\nindividual appeals and needs, are propositions which your whole bodily and\nmental experience will verify. And that experience does largely verify\nthese primeval religious ideas is proved by the fact that the mind\u2010cure\nmovement spreads as it does, not by proclamation and assertion simply, but\nby palpable experiential results. Here, in the very heyday of science\u2019s\nauthority, it carries on an aggressive warfare against the scientific\nphilosophy, and succeeds by using science\u2019s own peculiar methods and\nweapons. Believing that a higher power will take care of us in certain\nways better than we can take care of ourselves, if we only genuinely throw\nourselves upon it and consent to use it, it finds the belief, not only not\nimpugned, but corroborated by its observation.\nHow conversions are thus made, and converts confirmed, is evident enough\nfrom the narratives which I have quoted. I will quote yet another couple\nof shorter ones to give the matter a perfectly concrete turn. Here is\none:\u2014\n\u201cOne of my first experiences in applying my teaching was two\nmonths after I first saw the healer. I fell, spraining my right\nankle, which I had done once four years before, having then had to\nuse a crutch and elastic anklet for some months, and carefully\nguarding it ever since. As soon as I was on my feet I made the\npositive suggestion (and felt it through all my being): \u2018There is\nnothing but God, all life comes from him perfectly. I cannot be\nsprained or hurt, I will let him take care of it.\u2019 Well, I never\nhad a sensation in it, and I walked two miles that day.\u201d\nThe next case not only illustrates experiment and verification, but also\nthe element of passivity and surrender of which awhile ago I made such\naccount.\n\u201cI went into town to do some shopping one morning, and I had not\nbeen gone long before I began to feel ill. The ill feeling\nincreased rapidly, until I had pains in all my bones, nausea and\nfaintness, headache, all the symptoms in short that precede an\nattack of influenza. I thought that I was going to have the\ngrippe, epidemic then in Boston, or something worse. The mind\u2010cure\nteachings that I had been listening to all the winter thereupon\ncame into my mind, and I thought that here was an opportunity to\ntest myself. On my way home I met a friend, and I refrained with\nsome effort from telling her how I felt. That was the first step\ngained. I went to bed immediately, and my husband wished to send\nfor the doctor. But I told him that I would rather wait until\nmorning and see how I felt. Then followed one of the most\nbeautiful experiences of my life.\n\u201cI cannot express it in any other way than to say that I did \u2018lie\ndown in the stream of life and let it flow over me.\u2019 I gave up all\nfear of any impending disease; I was perfectly willing and\nobedient. There was no intellectual effort, or train of thought.\nMy dominant idea was: \u2018Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto\nme even as thou wilt,\u2019 and a perfect confidence that all would be\nwell, that all _was_ well. The creative life was flowing into me\nevery instant, and I felt myself allied with the Infinite, in\nharmony, and full of the peace that passeth understanding. There\nwas no place in my mind for a jarring body. I had no consciousness\nof time or space or persons; but only of love and happiness and\nfaith.\n\u201cI do not know how long this state lasted, nor when I fell asleep;\nbut when I woke up in the morning, _I was well_.\u201d\nThese are exceedingly trivial instances,(64) but in them, if we have\nanything at all, we have the method of experiment and verification. For\nthe point I am driving at now, it makes no difference whether you consider\nthe patients to be deluded victims of their imagination or not. That they\nseemed to _themselves_ to have been cured by the experiments tried was\nenough to make them converts to the system. And although it is evident\nthat one must be of a certain mental mould to get such results (for not\nevery one can get thus cured to his own satisfaction any more than every\none can be cured by the first regular practitioner whom he calls in), yet\nit would surely be pedantic and over\u2010scrupulous for those who _can_ get\ntheir savage and primitive philosophy of mental healing verified in such\nexperimental ways as this, to give them up at word of command for more\nscientific therapeutics. What are we to think of all this? Has science\nmade too wide a claim?\nI believe that the claims of the sectarian scientist are, to say the\nleast, premature. The experiences which we have been studying during this\nhour (and a great many other kinds of religious experiences are like them)\nplainly show the universe to be a more many\u2010sided affair than any sect,\neven the scientific sect, allows for. What, in the end, are all our\nverifications but experiences that agree with more or less isolated\nsystems of ideas (conceptual systems) that our minds have framed? But why\nin the name of common sense need we assume that only one such system of\nideas can be true? The obvious outcome of our total experience is that the\nworld can be handled according to many systems of ideas, and is so handled\nby different men, and will each time give some characteristic kind of\nprofit, for which he cares, to the handler, while at the same time some\nother kind of profit has to be omitted or postponed. Science gives to all\nof us telegraphy, electric lighting, and diagnosis, and succeeds in\npreventing and curing a certain amount of disease. Religion in the shape\nof mind\u2010cure gives to some of us serenity, moral poise, and happiness, and\nprevents certain forms of disease as well as science does, or even better\nin a certain class of persons. Evidently, then, the science and the\nreligion are both of them genuine keys for unlocking the world\u2019s treasure\u2010\nhouse to him who can use either of them practically. Just as evidently\nneither is exhaustive or exclusive of the other\u2019s simultaneous use. And\nwhy, after all, may not the world be so complex as to consist of many\ninterpenetrating spheres of reality, which we can thus approach in\nalternation by using different conceptions and assuming different\nattitudes, just as mathematicians handle the same numerical and spatial\nfacts by geometry, by analytical geometry, by algebra, by the calculus, or\nby quaternions, and each time come out right? On this view religion and\nscience, each verified in its own way from hour to hour and from life to\nlife, would be co\u2010eternal. Primitive thought, with its belief in\nindividualized personal forces, seems at any rate as far as ever from\nbeing driven by science from the field to\u2010day. Numbers of educated people\nstill find it the directest experimental channel by which to carry on\ntheir intercourse with reality.(65)\nThe case of mind\u2010cure lay so ready to my hand that I could not resist the\ntemptation of using it to bring these last truths home to your attention,\nbut I must content myself to\u2010day with this very brief indication. In a\nlater lecture the relations of religion both to science and to primitive\nthought will have to receive much more explicit attention.\nAppendix\n(See note to p. 121.)\nCASE I. \u201cMy own experience is this: I had long been ill, and one\nof the first results of my illness, a dozen years before, had been\na diplopia which deprived me of the use of my eyes for reading and\nwriting almost entirely, while a later one had been to shut me out\nfrom exercise of any kind under penalty of immediate and great\nexhaustion. I had been under the care of doctors of the highest\nstanding both in Europe and America, men in whose power to help me\nI had had great faith, with no or ill result. Then, at a time when\nI seemed to be rather rapidly losing ground, I heard some things\nthat gave me interest enough in mental healing to make me try it;\nI had no great hope of getting any good from it\u2014it was a _chance_\nI tried, partly because my thought was interested by the new\npossibility it seemed to open, partly because it was the only\nchance I then could see. I went to X. in Boston, from whom some\nfriends of mine had got, or thought that they had got, great help;\nthe treatment was a silent one; little was said, and that little\ncarried no conviction to my mind; whatever influence was exerted\nwas that of another person\u2019s thought or feeling silently projected\non to my unconscious mind, into my nervous system as it were, as\nwe sat still together. I believed from the start in the\n_possibility_ of such action, for I knew the power of the mind to\nshape, helping or hindering, the body\u2019s nerve\u2010activities, and I\nthought telepathy probable, although unproved, but I had no belief\nin it as more than a possibility, and no strong conviction nor any\nmystic or religious faith connected with my thought of it that\nmight have brought imagination strongly into play.\n\u201cI sat quietly with the healer for half an hour each day, at first\nwith no result; then, after ten days or so, I became quite\nsuddenly and swiftly conscious of a tide of new energy rising\nwithin me, a sense of power to pass beyond old halting\u2010places, of\npower to break the bounds that, though often tried before, had\nlong been veritable walls about my life, too high to climb. I\nbegan to read and walk as I had not done for years, and the change\nwas sudden, marked, and unmistakable. This tide seemed to mount\nfor some weeks, three or four perhaps, when, summer having come, I\ncame away, taking the treatment up again a few months later. The\nlift I got proved permanent, and left me slowly gaining ground\ninstead of losing it, but with this lift the influence seemed in a\nway to have spent itself, and, though my confidence in the reality\nof the power had gained immensely from this first experience, and\nshould have helped me to make further gain in health and strength\nif my belief in it had been the potent factor there, I never after\nthis got any result at all as striking or as clearly marked as\nthis which came when I made trial of it first, with little faith\nand doubtful expectation. It is difficult to put all the evidence\nin such a matter into words, to gather up into a distinct\nstatement all that one bases one\u2019s conclusions on, but I have\nalways felt that I had abundant evidence to justify (to myself, at\nleast) the conclusion that I came to then, and since have held to,\nthat the physical change which came at that time was, first, the\nresult of a change wrought within me by a change of mental state;\nand, secondly, that that change of mental state was not, save in a\nvery secondary way, brought about through the influence of an\nexcited imagination, or a _consciously_ received suggestion of an\nhypnotic sort. Lastly, I believe that this change was the result\nof my receiving telepathically, and upon a mental stratum quite\nbelow the level of immediate consciousness, a healthier and more\nenergetic attitude, receiving it from another person whose thought\nwas directed upon me with the intention of impressing the idea of\nthis attitude upon me. In my case the disease was distinctly what\nwould be classed as nervous, not organic; but from such\nopportunities as I have had of observing, I have come to the\nconclusion that the dividing line that has been drawn is an\narbitrary one, the nerves controlling the internal activities and\nthe nutrition of the body throughout; and I believe that the\ncentral nervous system, by starting and inhibiting local centres,\ncan exercise a vast influence upon disease of any kind, if it can\nbe brought to bear. In my judgment the question is simply how to\nbring it to bear, and I think that the uncertainty and remarkable\ndifferences in the results obtained through mental healing do but\nshow how ignorant we are as yet of the forces at work and of the\nmeans we should take to make them effective. That these results\nare not due to chance coincidences my observation of myself and\nothers makes me sure; that the conscious mind, the imagination,\nenters into them as a factor in many cases is doubtless true, but\nin many others, and sometimes very extraordinary ones, it hardly\nseems to enter in at all. On the whole I am inclined to think that\nas the healing action, like the morbid one, springs from the plane\nof the normally _un_conscious mind, so the strongest and most\neffective impressions are those which _it_ receives, in some as\nyet unknown, subtle way, _directly_ from a healthier mind whose\nstate, through a hidden law of sympathy, it reproduces.\u201d\nCASE II. \u201cAt the urgent request of friends, and with no faith and\nhardly any hope (possibly owing to a previous unsuccessful\nexperience with a Christian Scientist), our little daughter was\nplaced under the care of a healer, and cured of a trouble about\nwhich the physician had been very discouraging in his diagnosis.\nThis interested me, and I began studying earnestly the method and\nphilosophy of this method of healing. Gradually an inner peace and\ntranquillity came to me in so positive a way that my manner\nchanged greatly. My children and friends noticed the change and\ncommented upon it. All feelings of irritability disappeared. Even\nthe expression of my face changed noticeably.\n\u201cI had been bigoted, aggressive, and intolerant in discussion,\nboth in public and private. I grew broadly tolerant and receptive\ntoward the views of others. I had been nervous and irritable,\ncoming home two or three times a week with a sick headache\ninduced, as I then supposed, by dyspepsia and catarrh. I grew\nserene and gentle, and the physical troubles entirely disappeared.\nI had been in the habit of approaching every business interview\nwith an almost morbid dread. I now meet every one with confidence\nand inner calm.\n\u201cI may say that the growth has all been toward the elimination of\nselfishness. I do not mean simply the grosser, more sensual forms,\nbut those subtler and generally unrecognized kinds, such as\nexpress themselves in sorrow, grief, regret, envy, etc. It has\nbeen in the direction of a practical, working realization of the\nimmanence of God and the Divinity of man\u2019s true, inner self.\u201d\nLECTURES VI AND VII. THE SICK SOUL.\nAt our last meeting, we considered the healthy\u2010minded temperament, the\ntemperament which has a constitutional incapacity for prolonged suffering,\nand in which the tendency to see things optimistically is like a water of\ncrystallization in which the individual\u2019s character is set. We saw how\nthis temperament may become the basis for a peculiar type of religion, a\nreligion in which good, even the good of this world\u2019s life, is regarded as\nthe essential thing for a rational being to attend to. This religion\ndirects him to settle his scores with the more evil aspects of the\nuniverse by systematically declining to lay them to heart or make much of\nthem, by ignoring them in his reflective calculations, or even, on\noccasion, by denying outright that they exist. Evil is a disease; and\nworry over disease is itself an additional form of disease, which only\nadds to the original complaint. Even repentance and remorse, affections\nwhich come in the character of ministers of good, may be but sickly and\nrelaxing impulses. The best repentance is to up and act for righteousness,\nand forget that you ever had relations with sin.\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy has this sort of healthy\u2010mindedness woven into the\nheart of it, and this has been one secret of its fascination. He whom\nReason leads, according to Spinoza, is led altogether by the influence\nover his mind of good. Knowledge of evil is an \u201cinadequate\u201d knowledge, fit\nonly for slavish minds. So Spinoza categorically condemns repentance. When\nmen make mistakes, he says,\u2014\n\u201cOne might perhaps expect gnawings of conscience and repentance to\nhelp to bring them on the right path, and might thereupon conclude\n(as every one does conclude) that these affections are good\nthings. Yet when we look at the matter closely, we shall find that\nnot only are they not good, but on the contrary deleterious and\nevil passions. For it is manifest that we can always get along\nbetter by reason and love of truth than by worry of conscience and\nremorse. Harmful are these and evil, inasmuch as they form a\nparticular kind of sadness; and the disadvantages of sadness,\u201d he\ncontinues, \u201cI have already proved, and shown that we should strive\nto keep it from our life. Just so we should endeavor, since\nuneasiness of conscience and remorse are of this kind of\ncomplexion, to flee and shun these states of mind.\u201d(66)\nWithin the Christian body, for which repentance of sins has from the\nbeginning been the critical religious act, healthy\u2010mindedness has always\ncome forward with its milder interpretation. Repentance according to such\nhealthy\u2010minded Christians means _getting away from_ the sin, not groaning\nand writhing over its commission. The Catholic practice of confession and\nabsolution is in one of its aspects little more than a systematic method\nof keeping healthy\u2010mindedness on top. By it a man\u2019s accounts with evil are\nperiodically squared and audited, so that he may start the clean page with\nno old debts inscribed. Any Catholic will tell us how clean and fresh and\nfree he feels after the purging operation. Martin Luther by no means\nbelonged to the healthy\u2010minded type in the radical sense in which we have\ndiscussed it, and he repudiated priestly absolution for sin. Yet in this\nmatter of repentance he had some very healthy\u2010minded ideas, due in the\nmain to the largeness of his conception of God.\n\u201cWhen I was a monk,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought that I was utterly cast\naway, if at any time I felt the lust of the flesh: that is to say,\nif I felt any evil motion, fleshly lust, wrath, hatred, or envy\nagainst any brother. I assayed many ways to help to quiet my\nconscience, but it would not be; for the concupiscence and lust of\nmy flesh did always return, so that I could not rest, but was\ncontinually vexed with these thoughts: This or that sin thou hast\ncommitted: thou art infected with envy, with impatiency, and such\nother sins: therefore thou art entered into this holy order in\nvain, and all thy good works are unprofitable. But if then I had\nrightly understood these sentences of Paul: \u2018The flesh lusteth\ncontrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh; and\nthese two are one against another, so that ye cannot do the things\nthat ye would do,\u2019 I should not have so miserably tormented\nmyself, but should have thought and said to myself, as now\ncommonly I do, \u2018Martin, thou shalt not utterly be without sin, for\nthou hast flesh; thou shalt therefore feel the battle thereof.\u2019 I\nremember that Staupitz was wont to say, \u2018I have vowed unto God\nabove a thousand times that I would become a better man: but I\nnever performed that which I vowed. Hereafter I will make no such\nvow: for I have now learned by experience that I am not able to\nperform it. Unless, therefore, God be favorable and merciful unto\nme for Christ\u2019s sake, I shall not be able, with all my vows and\nall my good deeds, to stand before him.\u2019 This (of Staupitz\u2019s) was\nnot only a true, but also a godly and a holy desperation; and this\nmust they all confess, both with mouth and heart, who will be\nsaved. For the godly trust not to their own righteousness. They\nlook unto Christ their reconciler, who gave his life for their\nsins. Moreover, they know that the remnant of sin which is in\ntheir flesh is not laid to their charge, but freely pardoned.\nNotwithstanding, in the mean while they fight in spirit against\nthe flesh, lest they should _fulfill_ the lusts thereof; and\nalthough they feel the flesh to rage and rebel, and themselves\nalso do fall sometimes into sin through infirmity, yet are they\nnot discouraged, nor think therefore that their state and kind of\nlife, and the works which are done according to their calling,\ndisplease God; but they raise up themselves by faith.\u201d(67)\nOne of the heresies for which the Jesuits got that spiritual genius,\nMolinos, the founder of Quietism, so abominably condemned was his healthy\u2010\nminded opinion of repentance:\u2014\n\u201cWhen thou fallest into a fault, in what matter soever it be, do\nnot trouble nor afflict thyself for it. For they are effects of\nour frail Nature, stained by Original Sin. The common enemy will\nmake thee believe, as soon as thou fallest into any fault, that\nthou walkest in error, and therefore art out of God and his favor,\nand herewith would he make thee distrust of the divine Grace,\ntelling thee of thy misery, and making a giant of it; and putting\nit into thy head that every day thy soul grows worse instead of\nbetter, whilst it so often repeats these failings. O blessed Soul,\nopen thine eyes; and shut the gate against these diabolical\nsuggestions, knowing thy misery, and trusting in the mercy divine.\nWould not he be a mere fool who, running at tournament with\nothers, and falling in the best of the career, should lie weeping\non the ground and afflicting himself with discourses upon his\nfall? Man (they would tell him), lose no time, get up and take the\ncourse again, for he that rises again quickly and continues his\nrace is as if he had never fallen. If thou seest thyself fallen\nonce and a thousand times, thou oughtest to make use of the remedy\nwhich I have given thee, that is, a loving confidence in the\ndivine mercy. These are the weapons with which thou must fight and\nconquer cowardice and vain thoughts. This is the means thou\noughtest to use\u2014not to lose time, not to disturb thyself, and reap\nno good.\u201d(68)\nNow in contrast with such healthy\u2010minded views as these, if we treat them\nas a way of deliberately minimizing evil, stands a radically opposite\nview, a way of maximizing evil, if you please so to call it, based on the\npersuasion that the evil aspects of our life are of its very essence, and\nthat the world\u2019s meaning most comes home to us when we lay them most to\nheart. We have now to address ourselves to this more morbid way of looking\nat the situation. But as I closed our last hour with a general\nphilosophical reflection on the healthy\u2010minded way of taking life, I\nshould like at this point to make another philosophical reflection upon it\nbefore turning to that heavier task. You will excuse the brief delay.\nIf we admit that evil is an essential part of our being and the key to the\ninterpretation of our life, we load ourselves down with a difficulty that\nhas always proved burdensome in philosophies of religion. Theism, whenever\nit has erected itself into a systematic philosophy of the universe, has\nshown a reluctance to let God be anything less than All\u2010in\u2010All. In other\nwords, philosophic theism has always shown a tendency to become\npantheistic and monistic, and to consider the world as one unit of\nabsolute fact; and this has been at variance with popular or practical\ntheism, which latter has ever been more or less frankly pluralistic, not\nto say polytheistic, and shown itself perfectly well satisfied with a\nuniverse composed of many original principles, provided we be only allowed\nto believe that the divine principle remains supreme, and that the others\nare subordinate. In this latter case God is not necessarily responsible\nfor the existence of evil; he would only be responsible if it were not\nfinally overcome. But on the monistic or pantheistic view, evil, like\neverything else, must have its foundation in God; and the difficulty is to\nsee how this can possibly be the case if God be absolutely good. This\ndifficulty faces us in every form of philosophy in which the world appears\nas one flawless unit of fact. Such a unit is an _Individual_, and in it\nthe worst parts must be as essential as the best, must be as necessary to\nmake the individual what he is; since if any part whatever in an\nindividual were to vanish or alter, it would no longer be _that_\nindividual at all. The philosophy of absolute idealism, so vigorously\nrepresented both in Scotland and America to\u2010day, has to struggle with this\ndifficulty quite as much as scholastic theism struggled in its time; and\nalthough it would be premature to say that there is no speculative issue\nwhatever from the puzzle, it is perfectly fair to say that there is no\nclear or easy issue, and that the only _obvious_ escape from paradox here\nis to cut loose from the monistic assumption altogether, and to allow the\nworld to have existed from its origin in pluralistic form, as an aggregate\nor collection of higher and lower things and principles, rather than an\nabsolutely unitary fact. For then evil would not need to be essential; it\nmight be, and may always have been, an independent portion that had no\nrational or absolute right to live with the rest, and which we might\nconceivably hope to see got rid of at last.\nNow the gospel of healthy\u2010mindedness, as we have described it, casts its\nvote distinctly for this pluralistic view. Whereas the monistic\nphilosopher finds himself more or less bound to say, as Hegel said, that\neverything actual is rational, and that evil, as an element dialectically\nrequired, must be pinned in and kept and consecrated and have a function\nawarded to it in the final system of truth, healthy\u2010mindedness refuses to\nsay anything of the sort.(69) Evil, it says, is emphatically irrational,\nand _not_ to be pinned in, or preserved, or consecrated in any final\nsystem of truth. It is a pure abomination to the Lord, an alien unreality,\na waste element, to be sloughed off and negated, and the very memory of\nit, if possible, wiped out and forgotten. The ideal, so far from being co\u2010\nextensive with the whole actual, is a mere _extract_ from the actual,\nmarked by its deliverance from all contact with this diseased, inferior,\nand excrementitious stuff.\nHere we have the interesting notion fairly and squarely presented to us,\nof there being elements of the universe which may make no rational whole\nin conjunction with the other elements, and which, from the point of view\nof any system which those other elements make up, can only be considered\nso much irrelevance and accident\u2014so much \u201cdirt,\u201d as it were, and matter\nout of place. I ask you now not to forget this notion; for although most\nphilosophers seem either to forget it or to disdain it too much ever to\nmention it, I believe that we shall have to admit it ourselves in the end\nas containing an element of truth. The mind\u2010cure gospel thus once more\nappears to us as having dignity and importance. We have seen it to be a\ngenuine religion, and no mere silly appeal to imagination to cure disease;\nwe have seen its method of experimental verification to be not unlike the\nmethod of all science; and now here we find mind\u2010cure as the champion of a\nperfectly definite conception of the metaphysical structure of the world.\nI hope that, in view of all this, you will not regret my having pressed it\nupon your attention at such length.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLet us now say good\u2010by for a while to all this way of thinking, and turn\ntowards those persons who cannot so swiftly throw off the burden of the\nconsciousness of evil, but are congenitally fated to suffer from its\npresence. Just as we saw that in healthy\u2010mindedness there are shallower\nand profounder levels, happiness like that of the mere animal, and more\nregenerate sorts of happiness, so also are there different levels of the\nmorbid mind, and the one is much more formidable than the other. There are\npeople for whom evil means only a mal\u2010adjustment with _things_, a wrong\ncorrespondence of one\u2019s life with the environment. Such evil as this is\ncurable, in principle at least, upon the natural plane, for merely by\nmodifying either the self or the things, or both at once, the two terms\nmay be made to fit, and all go merry as a marriage bell again. But there\nare others for whom evil is no mere relation of the subject to particular\nouter things, but something more radical and general, a wrongness or vice\nin his essential nature, which no alteration of the environment, or any\nsuperficial rearrangement of the inner self, can cure, and which requires\na supernatural remedy. On the whole, the Latin races have leaned more\ntowards the former way of looking upon evil, as made up of ills and sins\nin the plural, removable in detail; while the Germanic races have tended\nrather to think of Sin in the singular, and with a capital S, as of\nsomething ineradicably ingrained in our natural subjectivity, and never to\nbe removed by any superficial piecemeal operations.(70) These comparisons\nof races are always open to exception, but undoubtedly the northern tone\nin religion has inclined to the more intimately pessimistic persuasion,\nand this way of feeling, being the more extreme, we shall find by far the\nmore instructive for our study.\nRecent psychology has found great use for the word \u201cthreshold\u201d as a\nsymbolic designation for the point at which one state of mind passes into\nanother. Thus we speak of the threshold of a man\u2019s consciousness in\ngeneral, to indicate the amount of noise, pressure, or other outer\nstimulus which it takes to arouse his attention at all. One with a high\nthreshold will doze through an amount of racket by which one with a low\nthreshold would be immediately waked. Similarly, when one is sensitive to\nsmall differences in any order of sensation, we say he has a low\n\u201cdifference\u2010threshold\u201d\u2014his mind easily steps over it into the\nconsciousness of the differences in question. And just so we might speak\nof a \u201cpain\u2010threshold,\u201d a \u201cfear\u2010threshold,\u201d a \u201cmisery\u2010threshold,\u201d and find\nit quickly overpassed by the consciousness of some individuals, but lying\ntoo high in others to be often reached by their consciousness. The\nsanguine and healthy\u2010minded live habitually on the sunny side of their\nmisery\u2010line, the depressed and melancholy live beyond it, in darkness and\napprehension. There are men who seem to have started in life with a bottle\nor two of champagne inscribed to their credit; whilst others seem to have\nbeen born close to the pain\u2010threshold, which the slightest irritants\nfatally send them over.\nDoes it not appear as if one who lived more habitually on one side of the\npain\u2010threshold might need a different sort of religion from one who\nhabitually lived on the other? This question, of the relativity of\ndifferent types of religion to different types of need, arises naturally\nat this point, and will become a serious problem ere we have done. But\nbefore we confront it in general terms, we must address ourselves to the\nunpleasant task of hearing what the sick souls, as we may call them in\ncontrast to the healthy\u2010minded, have to say of the secrets of their\nprison\u2010house, their own peculiar form of consciousness. Let us then\nresolutely turn our backs on the once\u2010born and their sky\u2010blue optimistic\ngospel; let us not simply cry out, in spite of all appearances, \u201cHurrah\nfor the Universe!\u2014God\u2019s in his Heaven, all\u2019s right with the world.\u201d Let us\nsee rather whether pity, pain, and fear, and the sentiment of human\nhelplessness may not open a profounder view and put into our hands a more\ncomplicated key to the meaning of the situation.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nTo begin with, how _can_ things so insecure as the successful experiences\nof this world afford a stable anchorage? A chain is no stronger than its\nweakest link, and life is after all a chain. In the healthiest and most\nprosperous existence, how many links of illness, danger, and disaster are\nalways interposed? Unsuspectedly from the bottom of every fountain of\npleasure, as the old poet said, something bitter rises up: a touch of\nnausea, a falling dead of the delight, a whiff of melancholy, things that\nsound a knell, for fugitive as they may be, they bring a feeling of coming\nfrom a deeper region and often have an appalling convincingness. The buzz\nof life ceases at their touch as a piano\u2010string stops sounding when the\ndamper falls upon it.\nOf course the music can commence again;\u2014and again and again,\u2014at intervals.\nBut with this the healthy\u2010minded consciousness is left with an\nirremediable sense of precariousness. It is a bell with a crack; it draws\nits breath on sufferance and by an accident.\nEven if we suppose a man so packed with healthy\u2010mindedness as never to\nhave experienced in his own person any of these sobering intervals, still,\nif he is a reflecting being, he must generalize and class his own lot with\nthat of others; and, doing so, he must see that his escape is just a lucky\nchance and no essential difference. He might just as well have been born\nto an entirely different fortune. And then indeed the hollow security!\nWhat kind of a frame of things is it of which the best you can say is,\n\u201cThank God, it has let me off clear this time!\u201d Is not its blessedness a\nfragile fiction? Is not your joy in it a very vulgar glee, not much unlike\nthe snicker of any rogue at his success? If indeed it were all success,\neven on such terms as that! But take the happiest man, the one most envied\nby the world, and in nine cases out of ten his inmost consciousness is one\nof failure. Either his ideals in the line of his achievements are pitched\nfar higher than the achievements themselves, or else he has secret ideals\nof which the world knows nothing, and in regard to which he inwardly knows\nhimself to be found wanting.\nWhen such a conquering optimist as Goethe can express himself in this\nwise, how must it be with less successful men?\n\u201cI will say nothing,\u201d writes Goethe in 1824, \u201cagainst the course\nof my existence. But at bottom it has been nothing but pain and\nburden, and I can affirm that during the whole of my 75 years, I\nhave not had four weeks of genuine well\u2010being. It is but the\nperpetual rolling of a rock that must be raised up again forever.\u201d\nWhat single\u2010handed man was ever on the whole as successful as Luther? yet\nwhen he had grown old, he looked back on his life as if it were an\nabsolute failure.\n\u201cI am utterly weary of life. I pray the Lord will come forthwith\nand carry me hence. Let him come, above all, with his last\nJudgment: I will stretch out my neck, the thunder will burst\nforth, and I shall be at rest.\u201d\u2014And having a necklace of white\nagates in his hand at the time he added: \u201cO God, grant that it may\ncome without delay. I would readily eat up this necklace to\u2010day,\nfor the Judgment to come to\u2010morrow.\u201d\u2014The Electress Dowager, one\nday when Luther was dining with her, said to him: \u201cDoctor, I wish\nyou may live forty years to come.\u201d \u201cMadam,\u201d replied he, \u201crather\nthan live forty years more, I would give up my chance of\nParadise.\u201d\nFailure, then, failure! so the world stamps us at every turn. We strew it\nwith our blunders, our misdeeds, our lost opportunities, with all the\nmemorials of our inadequacy to our vocation. And with what a damning\nemphasis does it then blot us out! No easy fine, no mere apology or formal\nexpiation, will satisfy the world\u2019s demands, but every pound of flesh\nexacted is soaked with all its blood. The subtlest forms of suffering\nknown to man are connected with the poisonous humiliations incidental to\nthese results.\nAnd they are pivotal human experiences. A process so ubiquitous and\neverlasting is evidently an integral part of life. \u201cThere is indeed one\nelement in human destiny,\u201d Robert Louis Stevenson writes, \u201cthat not\nblindness itself can controvert. Whatever else we are intended to do, we\nare not intended to succeed; failure is the fate allotted.\u201d(71) And our\nnature being thus rooted in failure, is it any wonder that theologians\nshould have held it to be essential, and thought that only through the\npersonal experience of humiliation which it engenders the deeper sense of\nlife\u2019s significance is reached?(72)\nBut this is only the first stage of the world\u2010sickness. Make the human\nbeing\u2019s sensitiveness a little greater, carry him a little farther over\nthe misery\u2010threshold, and the good quality of the successful moments\nthemselves when they occur is spoiled and vitiated. All natural goods\nperish. Riches take wings; fame is a breath; love is a cheat; youth and\nhealth and pleasure vanish. Can things whose end is always dust and\ndisappointment be the real goods which our souls require? Back of\neverything is the great spectre of universal death, the all\u2010encompassing\nblackness:\u2014\n\u201cWhat profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under\nthe Sun? I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and\nbehold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit. For that which\nbefalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; as the one dieth, so\ndieth the other; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust\nagain.... The dead know not anything, neither have they any more a\nreward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love and\ntheir hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any\nmore a portion for ever in anything that is done under the Sun....\nTruly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes\nto behold the Sun: but if a man live many years and rejoice in\nthem all, yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they\nshall be many.\u201d\nIn short, life and its negation are beaten up inextricably together. But\nif the life be good, the negation of it must be bad. Yet the two are\nequally essential facts of existence; and all natural happiness thus seems\ninfected with a contradiction. The breath of the sepulchre surrounds it.\nTo a mind attentive to this state of things and rightly subject to the\njoy\u2010destroying chill which such a contemplation engenders, the only relief\nthat healthy\u2010mindedness can give is by saying: \u201cStuff and nonsense, get\nout into the open air!\u201d or \u201cCheer up, old fellow, you\u2019ll be all right\nerelong, if you will only drop your morbidness!\u201d But in all seriousness,\ncan such bald animal talk as that be treated as a rational answer? To\nascribe religious value to mere happy\u2010go\u2010lucky contentment with one\u2019s\nbrief chance at natural good is but the very consecration of forgetfulness\nand superficiality. Our troubles lie indeed too deep for _that_ cure. The\nfact that we _can_ die, that we _can_ be ill at all, is what perplexes us;\nthe fact that we now for a moment live and are well is irrelevant to that\nperplexity. We need a life not correlated with death, a health not liable\nto illness, a kind of good that will not perish, a good in fact that flies\nbeyond the Goods of nature.\nIt all depends on how sensitive the soul may become to discords. \u201cThe\ntrouble with me is that I believe too much in common happiness and\ngoodness,\u201d said a friend of mine whose consciousness was of this sort,\n\u201cand nothing can console me for their transiency. I am appalled and\ndisconcerted at its being possible.\u201d And so with most of us: a little\ncooling down of animal excitability and instinct, a little loss of animal\ntoughness, a little irritable weakness and descent of the pain\u2010threshold,\nwill bring the worm at the core of all our usual springs of delight into\nfull view, and turn us into melancholy metaphysicians. The pride of life\nand glory of the world will shrivel. It is after all but the standing\nquarrel of hot youth and hoary eld. Old age has the last word: the purely\nnaturalistic look at life, however enthusiastically it may begin, is sure\nto end in sadness.\nThis sadness lies at the heart of every merely positivistic, agnostic, or\nnaturalistic scheme of philosophy. Let sanguine healthy\u2010mindedness do its\nbest with its strange power of living in the moment and ignoring and\nforgetting, still the evil background is really there to be thought of,\nand the skull will grin in at the banquet. In the practical life of the\nindividual, we know how his whole gloom or glee about any present fact\ndepends on the remoter schemes and hopes with which it stands related. Its\nsignificance and framing give it the chief part of its value. Let it be\nknown to lead nowhere, and however agreeable it may be in its immediacy,\nits glow and gilding vanish. The old man, sick with an insidious internal\ndisease, may laugh and quaff his wine at first as well as ever, but he\nknows his fate now, for the doctors have revealed it; and the knowledge\nknocks the satisfaction out of all these functions. They are partners of\ndeath and the worm is their brother, and they turn to a mere flatness.\nThe lustre of the present hour is always borrowed from the background of\npossibilities it goes with. Let our common experiences be enveloped in an\neternal moral order; let our suffering have an immortal significance; let\nHeaven smile upon the earth, and deities pay their visits; let faith and\nhope be the atmosphere which man breathes in;\u2014and his days pass by with\nzest; they stir with prospects, they thrill with remoter values. Place\nround them on the contrary the curdling cold and gloom and absence of all\npermanent meaning which for pure naturalism and the popular science\nevolutionism of our time are all that is visible ultimately, and the\nthrill stops short, or turns rather to an anxious trembling.\nFor naturalism, fed on recent cosmological speculations, mankind is in a\nposition similar to that of a set of people living on a frozen lake,\nsurrounded by cliffs over which there is no escape, yet knowing that\nlittle by little the ice is melting, and the inevitable day drawing near\nwhen the last film of it will disappear, and to be drowned ignominiously\nwill be the human creature\u2019s portion. The merrier the skating, the warmer\nand more sparkling the sun by day, and the ruddier the bonfires at night,\nthe more poignant the sadness with which one must take in the meaning of\nthe total situation.\nThe early Greeks are continually held up to us in literary works as models\nof the healthy\u2010minded joyousness which the religion of nature may\nengender. There was indeed much joyousness among the Greeks\u2014Homer\u2019s flow\nof enthusiasm for most things that the sun shines upon is steady. But even\nin Homer the reflective passages are cheerless,(73) and the moment the\nGreeks grew systematically pensive and thought of ultimates, they became\nunmitigated pessimists.(74) The jealousy of the gods, the nemesis that\nfollows too much happiness, the all\u2010encompassing death, fate\u2019s dark\nopacity, the ultimate and unintelligible cruelty, were the fixed\nbackground of their imagination. The beautiful joyousness of their\npolytheism is only a poetic modern fiction. They knew no joys comparable\nin quality of preciousness to those which we shall erelong see that\nBrahmans, Buddhists, Christians, Mohammedans, twice\u2010born people whose\nreligion is non\u2010naturalistic, get from their several creeds of mysticism\nand renunciation.\nStoic insensibility and Epicurean resignation were the farthest advance\nwhich the Greek mind made in that direction. The Epicurean said: \u201cSeek not\nto be happy, but rather to escape unhappiness; strong happiness is always\nlinked with pain; therefore hug the safe shore, and do not tempt the\ndeeper raptures. Avoid disappointment by expecting little, and by aiming\nlow; and above all do not fret.\u201d The Stoic said: \u201cThe only genuine good\nthat life can yield a man is the free possession of his own soul; all\nother goods are lies.\u201d Each of these philosophies is in its degree a\nphilosophy of despair in nature\u2019s boons. Trustful self\u2010abandonment to the\njoys that freely offer has entirely departed from both Epicurean and\nStoic; and what each proposes is a way of rescue from the resultant dust\u2010\nand\u2010ashes state of mind. The Epicurean still awaits results from economy\nof indulgence and damping of desire. The Stoic hopes for no results, and\ngives up natural good altogether. There is dignity in both these forms of\nresignation. They represent distinct stages in the sobering process which\nman\u2019s primitive intoxication with sense\u2010happiness is sure to undergo. In\nthe one the hot blood has grown cool, in the other it has become quite\ncold; and although I have spoken of them in the past tense, as if they\nwere merely historic, yet Stoicism and Epicureanism will probably be to\nall time typical attitudes, marking a certain definite stage accomplished\nin the evolution of the world\u2010sick soul.(75) They mark the conclusion of\nwhat we call the once\u2010born period, and represent the highest flights of\nwhat twice\u2010born religion would call the purely natural man\u2014Epicureanism,\nwhich can only by great courtesy be called a religion, showing his\nrefinement, and Stoicism exhibiting his moral will. They leave the world\nin the shape of an unreconciled contradiction, and seek no higher unity.\nCompared with the complex ecstasies which the supernaturally regenerated\nChristian may enjoy, or the oriental pantheist indulge in, their receipts\nfor equanimity are expedients which seem almost crude in their simplicity.\nPlease observe, however, that I am not yet pretending finally to _judge_\nany of these attitudes. I am only describing their variety.\nThe securest way to the rapturous sorts of happiness of which the twice\u2010\nborn make report has as an historic matter of fact been through a more\nradical pessimism than anything that we have yet considered. We have seen\nhow the lustre and enchantment may be rubbed off from the goods of nature.\nBut there is a pitch of unhappiness so great that the goods of nature may\nbe entirely forgotten, and all sentiment of their existence vanish from\nthe mental field. For this extremity of pessimism to be reached, something\nmore is needed than observation of life and reflection upon death. The\nindividual must in his own person become the prey of a pathological\nmelancholy. As the healthy\u2010minded enthusiast succeeds in ignoring evil\u2019s\nvery existence, so the subject of melancholy is forced in spite of himself\nto ignore that of all good whatever: for him it may no longer have the\nleast reality. Such sensitiveness and susceptibility to mental pain is a\nrare occurrence where the nervous constitution is entirely normal; one\nseldom finds it in a healthy subject even where he is the victim of the\nmost atrocious cruelties of outward fortune. So we note here the neurotic\nconstitution, of which I said so much in my first lecture, making its\nactive entrance on our scene, and destined to play a part in much that\nfollows. Since these experiences of melancholy are in the first instance\nabsolutely private and individual, I can now help myself out with personal\ndocuments. Painful indeed they will be to listen to, and there is almost\nan indecency in handling them in public. Yet they lie right in the middle\nof our path; and if we are to touch the psychology of religion at all\nseriously, we must be willing to forget conventionalities, and dive below\nthe smooth and lying official conversational surface.\nOne can distinguish many kinds of pathological depression. Sometimes it is\nmere passive joylessness and dreariness, discouragement, dejection, lack\nof taste and zest and spring. Professor Ribot has proposed the name\n_anhedonia_ to designate this condition.\n\u201cThe state of _anhedonia_, if I may coin a new word to pair off\nwith _analgesia_,\u201d he writes, \u201chas been very little studied, but\nit exists. A young girl was smitten with a liver disease which for\nsome time altered her constitution. She felt no longer any\naffection for her father and mother. She would have played with\nher doll, but it was impossible to find the least pleasure in the\nact. The same things which formerly convulsed her with laughter\nentirely failed to interest her now. Esquirol observed the case of\na very intelligent magistrate who was also a prey to hepatic\ndisease. Every emotion appeared dead within him. He manifested\nneither perversion nor violence, but complete absence of emotional\nreaction. If he went to the theatre, which he did out of habit, he\ncould find no pleasure there. The thought of his house, of his\nhome, of his wife, and of his absent children moved him as little,\nhe said, as a theorem of Euclid.\u201d(76)\nProlonged seasickness will in most persons produce a temporary condition\nof anhedonia. Every good, terrestrial or celestial, is imagined only to be\nturned from with disgust. A temporary condition of this sort, connected\nwith the religious evolution of a singularly lofty character, both\nintellectual and moral, is well described by the Catholic philosopher,\nFather Gratry, in his autobiographical recollections. In consequence of\nmental isolation and excessive study at the Polytechnic school, young\nGratry fell into a state of nervous exhaustion with symptoms which he thus\ndescribes:\u2014\n\u201cI had such a universal terror that I woke at night with a start,\nthinking that the Pantheon was tumbling on the Polytechnic school,\nor that the school was in flames, or that the Seine was pouring\ninto the Catacombs, and that Paris was being swallowed up. And\nwhen these impressions were past, all day long without respite I\nsuffered an incurable and intolerable desolation, verging on\ndespair. I thought myself, in fact, rejected by God, lost, damned!\nI felt something like the suffering of hell. Before that I had\nnever even thought of hell. My mind had never turned in that\ndirection. Neither discourses nor reflections had impressed me in\nthat way. I took no account of hell. Now, and all at once, I\nsuffered in a measure what is suffered there.\n\u201cBut what was perhaps still more dreadful is that every idea of\nheaven was taken away from me: I could no longer conceive of\nanything of the sort. Heaven did not seem to me worth going to. It\nwas like a vacuum; a mythological elysium, an abode of shadows\nless real than the earth. I could conceive no joy, no pleasure in\ninhabiting it. Happiness, joy, light, affection, love\u2014all these\nwords were now devoid of sense. Without doubt I could still have\ntalked of all these things, but I had become incapable of feeling\nanything in them, of understanding anything about them, of hoping\nanything from them, or of believing them to exist. There was my\ngreat and inconsolable grief! I neither perceived nor conceived\nany longer the existence of happiness or perfection. An abstract\nheaven over a naked rock. Such was my present abode for\neternity.\u201d(77)\nSo much for melancholy in the sense of incapacity for joyous feeling. A\nmuch worse form of it is positive and active anguish, a sort of psychical\nneuralgia wholly unknown to healthy life. Such anguish may partake of\nvarious characters, having sometimes more the quality of loathing;\nsometimes that of irritation and exasperation; or again of self\u2010mistrust\nand self\u2010despair; or of suspicion, anxiety, trepidation, fear. The patient\nmay rebel or submit; may accuse himself, or accuse outside powers; and he\nmay or he may not be tormented by the theoretical mystery of why he should\nso have to suffer. Most cases are mixed cases, and we should not treat our\nclassifications with too much respect. Moreover, it is only a relatively\nsmall proportion of cases that connect themselves with the religious\nsphere of experience at all. Exasperated cases, for instance, as a rule do\nnot. I quote now literally from the first case of melancholy on which I\nlay my hand. It is a letter from a patient in a French asylum.\n\u201cI suffer too much in this hospital, both physically and morally.\nBesides the burnings and the sleeplessness (for I no longer sleep\nsince I am shut up here, and the little rest I get is broken by\nbad dreams, and I am waked with a jump by nightmares, dreadful\nvisions, lightning, thunder, and the rest), fear, atrocious fear,\npresses me down, holds me without respite, never lets me go. Where\nis the justice in it all! What have I done to deserve this excess\nof severity? Under what form will this fear crush me? What would I\nnot owe to any one who would rid me of my life! Eat, drink, lie\nawake all night, suffer without interruption\u2014such is the fine\nlegacy I have received from my mother! What I fail to understand\nis this abuse of power. There are limits to everything, there is a\nmiddle way. But God knows neither middle way nor limits. I say\nGod, but why? All I have known so far has been the devil. After\nall, I am afraid of God as much as of the devil, so I drift along,\nthinking of nothing but suicide, but with neither courage nor\nmeans here to execute the act. As you read this, it will easily\nprove to you my insanity. The style and the ideas are incoherent\nenough\u2014I can see that myself. But I cannot keep myself from being\neither crazy or an idiot; and, as things are, from whom should I\nask pity? I am defenseless against the invisible enemy who is\ntightening his coils around me. I should be no better armed\nagainst him even if I saw him, or had seen him. Oh, if he would\nbut kill me, devil take him! Death, death, once for all! But I\nstop. I have raved to you long enough. I say raved, for I can\nwrite no otherwise, having neither brain nor thoughts left. O God!\nwhat a misfortune to be born! Born like a mushroom, doubtless\nbetween an evening and a morning; and how true and right I was\nwhen in our philosophy\u2010year in college I chewed the cud of\nbitterness with the pessimists. Yes, indeed, there is more pain in\nlife than gladness\u2014it is one long agony until the grave. Think how\ngay it makes me to remember that this horrible misery of mine,\ncoupled with this unspeakable fear, may last fifty, one hundred,\nwho knows how many more years!\u201d(78)\nThis letter shows two things. First, you see how the entire consciousness\nof the poor man is so choked with the feeling of evil that the sense of\nthere being any good in the world is lost for him altogether. His\nattention excludes it, cannot admit it: the sun has left his heaven. And\nsecondly you see how the querulous temper of his misery keeps his mind\nfrom taking a religious direction. Querulousness of mind tends in fact\nrather towards irreligion; and it has played, so far as I know, no part\nwhatever in the construction of religious systems.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nReligious melancholy must be cast in a more melting mood. Tolstoy has left\nus, in his book called My Confession, a wonderful account of the attack of\nmelancholy which led him to his own religious conclusions. The latter in\nsome respects are peculiar; but the melancholy presents two characters\nwhich make it a typical document for our present purpose. First it is a\nwell\u2010marked case of anhedonia, of passive loss of appetite for all life\u2019s\nvalues; and second, it shows how the altered and estranged aspect which\nthe world assumed in consequence of this stimulated Tolstoy\u2019s intellect to\na gnawing, carking questioning and effort for philosophic relief. I mean\nto quote Tolstoy at some length; but before doing so, I will make a\ngeneral remark on each of these two points.\nFirst on our spiritual judgments and the sense of value in general.\nIt is notorious that facts are compatible with opposite emotional\ncomments, since the same fact will inspire entirely different feelings in\ndifferent persons, and at different times in the same person; and there is\nno rationally deducible connection between any outer fact and the\nsentiments it may happen to provoke. These have their source in another\nsphere of existence altogether, in the animal and spiritual region of the\nsubject\u2019s being. Conceive yourself, if possible, suddenly stripped of all\nthe emotion with which your world now inspires you, and try to imagine it\n_as it exists_, purely by itself, without your favorable or unfavorable,\nhopeful or apprehensive comment. It will be almost impossible for you to\nrealize such a condition of negativity and deadness. No one portion of the\nuniverse would then have importance beyond another; and the whole\ncollection of its things and series of its events would be without\nsignificance, character, expression, or perspective. Whatever of value,\ninterest, or meaning our respective worlds may appear endued with are thus\npure gifts of the spectator\u2019s mind. The passion of love is the most\nfamiliar and extreme example of this fact. If it comes, it comes; if it\ndoes not come, no process of reasoning can force it. Yet it transforms the\nvalue of the creature loved as utterly as the sunrise transforms Mont\nBlanc from a corpse\u2010like gray to a rosy enchantment; and it sets the whole\nworld to a new tune for the lover and gives a new issue to his life. So\nwith fear, with indignation, jealousy, ambition, worship. If they are\nthere, life changes. And whether they shall be there or not depends almost\nalways upon non\u2010logical, often on organic conditions. And as the excited\ninterest which these passions put into the world is our gift to the world,\njust so are the passions themselves _gifts_,\u2014gifts to us, from sources\nsometimes low and sometimes high; but almost always non\u2010logical and beyond\nour control. How can the moribund old man reason back to himself the\nromance, the mystery, the imminence of great things with which our old\nearth tingled for him in the days when he was young and well? Gifts,\neither of the flesh or of the spirit; and the spirit bloweth where it\nlisteth; and the world\u2019s materials lend their surface passively to all the\ngifts alike, as the stage\u2010setting receives indifferently whatever\nalternating colored lights may be shed upon it from the optical apparatus\nin the gallery.\nMeanwhile the practically real world for each one of us, the effective\nworld of the individual, is the compound world, the physical facts and\nemotional values in indistinguishable combination. Withdraw or pervert\neither factor of this complex resultant, and the kind of experience we\ncall pathological ensues.\nIn Tolstoy\u2019s case the sense that life had any meaning whatever was for a\ntime wholly withdrawn. The result was a transformation in the whole\nexpression of reality. When we come to study the phenomenon of conversion\nor religious regeneration, we shall see that a not infrequent consequence\nof the change operated in the subject is a transfiguration of the face of\nnature in his eyes. A new heaven seems to shine upon a new earth. In\nmelancholiacs there is usually a similar change, only it is in the reverse\ndirection. The world now looks remote, strange, sinister, uncanny. Its\ncolor is gone, its breath is cold, there is no speculation in the eyes it\nglares with. \u201cIt is as if I lived in another century,\u201d says one asylum\npatient.\u2014\u201cI see everything through a cloud,\u201d says another, \u201cthings are not\nas they were, and I am changed.\u201d\u2014\u201cI see,\u201d says a third, \u201cI touch, but the\nthings do not come near me, a thick veil alters the hue and look of\neverything.\u201d\u2014\u201cPersons move like shadows, and sounds seem to come from a\ndistant world.\u201d\u2014\u201cThere is no longer any past for me; people appear so\nstrange; it is as if I could not see any reality, as if I were in a\ntheatre; as if people were actors, and everything were scenery; I can no\nlonger find myself; I walk, but why? Everything floats before my eyes, but\nleaves no impression.\u201d\u2014\u201cI weep false tears, I have unreal hands: the\nthings I see are not real things.\u201d\u2014Such are expressions that naturally\nrise to the lips of melancholy subjects describing their changed\nstate.(79)\nNow there are some subjects whom all this leaves a prey to the profoundest\nastonishment. The strangeness is wrong. The unreality cannot be. A mystery\nis concealed, and a metaphysical solution must exist. If the natural world\nis so double\u2010faced and unhomelike, what world, what thing is real? An\nurgent wondering and questioning is set up, a poring theoretic activity,\nand in the desperate effort to get into right relations with the matter,\nthe sufferer is often led to what becomes for him a satisfying religious\nsolution.\nAt about the age of fifty, Tolstoy relates that he began to have moments\nof perplexity, of what he calls arrest, as if he knew not \u201chow to live,\u201d\nor what to do. It is obvious that these were moments in which the\nexcitement and interest which our functions naturally bring had ceased.\nLife had been enchanting, it was now flat sober, more than sober, dead.\nThings were meaningless whose meaning had always been self\u2010evident. The\nquestions \u201cWhy?\u201d and \u201cWhat next?\u201d began to beset him more and more\nfrequently. At first it seemed as if such questions must be answerable,\nand as if he could easily find the answers if he would take the time; but\nas they ever became more urgent, he perceived that it was like those first\ndiscomforts of a sick man, to which he pays but little attention till they\nrun into one continuous suffering, and then he realizes that what he took\nfor a passing disorder means the most momentous thing in the world for\nhim, means his death.\nThese questions \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWherefore?\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d found no response.\n\u201cI felt,\u201d says Tolstoy, \u201cthat something had broken within me on\nwhich my life had always rested, that I had nothing left to hold\non to, and that morally my life had stopped. An invincible force\nimpelled me to get rid of my existence, in one way or another. It\ncannot be said exactly that I _wished_ to kill myself, for the\nforce which drew me away from life was fuller, more powerful, more\ngeneral than any mere desire. It was a force like my old\naspiration to live, only it impelled me in the opposite direction.\nIt was an aspiration of my whole being to get out of life.\n\u201cBehold me then, a man happy and in good health, hiding the rope\nin order not to hang myself to the rafters of the room where every\nnight I went to sleep alone; behold me no longer going shooting,\nlest I should yield to the too easy temptation of putting an end\nto myself with my gun.\n\u201cI did not know what I wanted. I was afraid of life; I was driven\nto leave it; and in spite of that I still hoped something from it.\n\u201cAll this took place at a time when so far as all my outer\ncircumstances went, I ought to have been completely happy. I had a\ngood wife who loved me and whom I loved; good children and a large\nproperty which was increasing with no pains taken on my part. I\nwas more respected by my kinsfolk and acquaintance than I had ever\nbeen; I was loaded with praise by strangers; and without\nexaggeration I could believe my name already famous. Moreover I\nwas neither insane nor ill. On the contrary, I possessed a\nphysical and mental strength which I have rarely met in persons of\nmy age. I could mow as well as the peasants, I could work with my\nbrain eight hours uninterruptedly and feel no bad effects.\n\u201cAnd yet I could give no reasonable meaning to any actions of my\nlife. And I was surprised that I had not understood this from the\nvery beginning. My state of mind was as if some wicked and stupid\njest was being played upon me by some one. One can live only so\nlong as one is intoxicated, drunk with life; but when one grows\nsober one cannot fail to see that it is all a stupid cheat. What\nis truest about it is that there is nothing even funny or silly in\nit; it is cruel and stupid, purely and simply.\n\u201cThe oriental fable of the traveler surprised in the desert by a\nwild beast is very old.\n\u201cSeeking to save himself from the fierce animal, the traveler\njumps into a well with no water in it; but at the bottom of this\nwell he sees a dragon waiting with open mouth to devour him. And\nthe unhappy man, not daring to go out lest he should be the prey\nof the beast, not daring to jump to the bottom lest he should be\ndevoured by the dragon, clings to the branches of a wild bush\nwhich grows out of one of the cracks of the well. His hands\nweaken, and he feels that he must soon give way to certain fate;\nbut still he clings, and sees two mice, one white, the other\nblack, evenly moving round the bush to which he hangs, and gnawing\noff its roots.\n\u201cThe traveler sees this and knows that he must inevitably perish;\nbut while thus hanging he looks about him and finds on the leaves\nof the bush some drops of honey. These he reaches with his tongue\nand licks them off with rapture.\n\u201cThus I hang upon the boughs of life, knowing that the inevitable\ndragon of death is waiting ready to tear me, and I cannot\ncomprehend why I am thus made a martyr. I try to suck the honey\nwhich formerly consoled me; but the honey pleases me no longer,\nand day and night the white mouse and the black mouse gnaw the\nbranch to which I cling. I can see but one thing: the inevitable\ndragon and the mice\u2014I cannot turn my gaze away from them.\n\u201cThis is no fable, but the literal incontestable truth which every\none may understand. What will be the outcome of what I do to\u2010day?\nOf what I shall do to\u2010morrow? What will be the outcome of all my\nlife? Why should I live? Why should I do anything? Is there in\nlife any purpose which the inevitable death which awaits me does\nnot undo and destroy?\n\u201cThese questions are the simplest in the world. From the stupid\nchild to the wisest old man, they are in the soul of every human\nbeing. Without an answer to them, it is impossible, as I\nexperienced, for life to go on.\n\u201c \u2018But perhaps,\u2019 I often said to myself, \u2018there may be something I\nhave failed to notice or to comprehend. It is not possible that\nthis condition of despair should be natural to mankind.\u2019 And I\nsought for an explanation in all the branches of knowledge\nacquired by men. I questioned painfully and protractedly and with\nno idle curiosity. I sought, not with indolence, but laboriously\nand obstinately for days and nights together. I sought like a man\nwho is lost and seeks to save himself,\u2014and I found nothing. I\nbecame convinced, moreover, that all those who before me had\nsought for an answer in the sciences have also found nothing. And\nnot only this, but that they have recognized that the very thing\nwhich was leading me to despair\u2014the meaningless absurdity of\nlife\u2014is the only incontestable knowledge accessible to man.\u201d\nTo prove this point, Tolstoy quotes the Buddha, Solomon, and Schopenhauer.\nAnd he finds only four ways in which men of his own class and society are\naccustomed to meet the situation. Either mere animal blindness, sucking\nthe honey without seeing the dragon or the mice,\u2014\u201cand from such a way,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cI can learn nothing, after what I now know;\u201d or reflective\nepicureanism, snatching what it can while the day lasts,\u2014which is only a\nmore deliberate sort of stupefaction than the first; or manly suicide; or\nseeing the mice and dragon and yet weakly and plaintively clinging to the\nbush of life.\nSuicide was naturally the consistent course dictated by the logical\nintellect.\n\u201cYet,\u201d says Tolstoy, \u201cwhilst my intellect was working, something\nelse in me was working too, and kept me from the deed\u2014a\nconsciousness of life, as I may call it, which was like a force\nthat obliged my mind to fix itself in another direction and draw\nme out of my situation of despair.... During the whole course of\nthis year, when I almost unceasingly kept asking myself how to end\nthe business, whether by the rope or by the bullet, during all\nthat time, alongside of all those movements of my ideas and\nobservations, my heart kept languishing with another pining\nemotion. I can call this by no other name than that of a thirst\nfor God. This craving for God had nothing to do with the movement\nof my ideas,\u2014in fact, it was the direct contrary of that\nmovement,\u2014but it came from my heart. It was like a feeling of\ndread that made me seem like an orphan and isolated in the midst\nof all these things that were so foreign. And this feeling of\ndread was mitigated by the hope of finding the assistance of some\none.\u201d(80)\nOf the process, intellectual as well as emotional, which, starting from\nthis idea of God, led to Tolstoy\u2019s recovery, I will say nothing in this\nlecture, reserving it for a later hour. The only thing that need interest\nus now is the phenomenon of his absolute disenchantment with ordinary\nlife, and the fact that the whole range of habitual values may, to a man\nas powerful and full of faculty as he was, come to appear so ghastly a\nmockery.\nWhen disillusionment has gone as far as this, there is seldom a\n_restitutio ad integrum_. One has tasted of the fruit of the tree, and the\nhappiness of Eden never comes again. The happiness that comes, when any\ndoes come,\u2014and often enough it fails to return in an acute form, though\nits form is sometimes very acute,\u2014is not the simple ignorance of ill, but\nsomething vastly more complex, including natural evil as one of its\nelements, but finding natural evil no such stumbling\u2010block and terror\nbecause it now sees it swallowed up in supernatural good. The process is\none of redemption, not of mere reversion to natural health, and the\nsufferer, when saved, is saved by what seems to him a second birth, a\ndeeper kind of conscious being than he could enjoy before.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWe find a somewhat different type of religious melancholy enshrined in\nliterature in John Bunyan\u2019s autobiography. Tolstoy\u2019s preoccupations were\nlargely objective, for the purpose and meaning of life in general was what\nso troubled him; but poor Bunyan\u2019s troubles were over the condition of his\nown personal self. He was a typical case of the psychopathic temperament,\nsensitive of conscience to a diseased degree, beset by doubts, fears, and\ninsistent ideas, and a victim of verbal automatisms, both motor and\nsensory. These were usually texts of Scripture which, sometimes damnatory\nand sometimes favorable, would come in a half\u2010hallucinatory form as if\nthey were voices, and fasten on his mind and buffet it between them like a\nshuttlecock. Added to this were a fearful melancholy self\u2010contempt and\ndespair.\n\u201cNay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse; now I am farther from\nconversion than ever I was before. If now I should have burned at\nthe stake, I could not believe that Christ had love for me; alas,\nI could neither hear him, nor see him, nor feel him, nor savor any\nof his things. Sometimes I would tell my condition to the people\nof God, which, when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell\nof the Promises. But they had as good have told me that I must\nreach the Sun with my finger as have bidden me receive or rely\nupon the Promise. [Yet] all this while as to the act of sinning, I\nnever was more tender than now; I durst not take a pin or stick,\nthough but so big as a straw, for my conscience now was sore, and\nwould smart at every touch; I could not tell how to speak my\nwords, for fear I should misplace them. Oh, how gingerly did I\nthen go, in all I did or said! I found myself as on a miry bog\nthat shook if I did but stir; and was as there left both by God\nand Christ, and the spirit, and all good things.\n\u201cBut my original and inward pollution, that was my plague and my\naffliction. By reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own eyes\nthan was a toad; and I thought I was so in God\u2019s eyes too. Sin and\ncorruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of my heart as\nwater would bubble out of a fountain. I could have changed heart\nwith anybody. I thought none but the Devil himself could equal me\nfor inward wickedness and pollution of mind. Sure, thought I, I am\nforsaken of God; and thus I continued a long while, even for some\nyears together.\n\u201cAnd now I was sorry that God had made me a man. The beasts,\nbirds, fishes, etc., I blessed their condition, for they had not a\nsinful nature; they were not obnoxious to the wrath of God; they\nwere not to go to hell\u2010fire after death. I could therefore have\nrejoiced, had my condition been as any of theirs. Now I blessed\nthe condition of the dog and toad, yea, gladly would I have been\nin the condition of the dog or horse, for I knew they had no soul\nto perish under the everlasting weight of Hell or Sin, as mine was\nlike to do. Nay, and though I saw this, felt this, and was broken\nto pieces with it, yet that which added to my sorrow was, that I\ncould not find with all my soul that I did desire deliverance. My\nheart was at times exceedingly hard. If I would have given a\nthousand pounds for a tear, I could not shed one; no, nor\nsometimes scarce desire to shed one.\n\u201cI was both a burthen and a terror to myself; nor did I ever so\nknow, as now, what it was to be weary of my life, and yet afraid\nto die. How gladly would I have been anything but myself! Anything\nbut a man! and in any condition but my own.\u201d(81)\nPoor patient Bunyan, like Tolstoy, saw the light again, but we must also\npostpone that part of his story to another hour. In a later lecture I will\nalso give the end of the experience of Henry Alline, a devoted evangelist\nwho worked in Nova Scotia a hundred years ago, and who thus vividly\ndescribes the high\u2010water mark of the religious melancholy which formed its\nbeginning. The type was not unlike Bunyan\u2019s.\n\u201cEverything I saw seemed to be a burden to me; the earth seemed\naccursed for my sake: all trees, plants, rocks, hills, and vales\nseemed to be dressed in mourning and groaning, under the weight of\nthe curse, and everything around me seemed to be conspiring my\nruin. My sins seemed to be laid open; so that I thought that every\none I saw knew them, and sometimes I was almost ready to\nacknowledge many things, which I thought they knew: yea sometimes\nit seemed to me as if every one was pointing me out as the most\nguilty wretch upon earth. I had now so great a sense of the vanity\nand emptiness of all things here below, that I knew the whole\nworld could not possibly make me happy, no, nor the whole system\nof creation. When I waked in the morning, the first thought would\nbe, Oh, my wretched soul, what shall I do, where shall I go? And\nwhen I laid down, would say, I shall be perhaps in hell before\nmorning. I would many times look on the beasts with envy, wishing\nwith all my heart I was in their place, that I might have no soul\nto lose; and when I have seen birds flying over my head, have\noften thought within myself, Oh, that I could fly away from my\ndanger and distress! Oh, how happy should I be, if I were in their\nplace!\u201d(82)\nEnvy of the placid beasts seems to be a very widespread affection in this\ntype of sadness.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe worst kind of melancholy is that which takes the form of panic fear.\nHere is an excellent example, for permission to print which I have to\nthank the sufferer. The original is in French, and though the subject was\nevidently in a bad nervous condition at the time of which he writes, his\ncase has otherwise the merit of extreme simplicity. I translate freely.\n\u201cWhilst in this state of philosophic pessimism and general\ndepression of spirits about my prospects, I went one evening into\na dressing\u2010room in the twilight to procure some article that was\nthere; when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just\nas if it came out of the darkness, a horrible fear of my own\nexistence. Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an\nepileptic patient whom I had seen in the asylum, a black\u2010haired\nyouth with greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all\nday on one of the benches, or rather shelves against the wall,\nwith his knees drawn up against his chin, and the coarse gray\nundershirt, which was his only garment, drawn over them inclosing\nhis entire figure. He sat there like a sort of sculptured Egyptian\ncat or Peruvian mummy, moving nothing but his black eyes and\nlooking absolutely non\u2010human. This image and my fear entered into\na species of combination with each other. _That shape am I_, I\nfelt, potentially. Nothing that I possess can defend me against\nthat fate, if the hour for it should strike for me as it struck\nfor him. There was such a horror of him, and such a perception of\nmy own merely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was as if\nsomething hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I\nbecame a mass of quivering fear. After this the universe was\nchanged for me altogether. I awoke morning after morning with a\nhorrible dread at the pit of my stomach, and with a sense of the\ninsecurity of life that I never knew before, and that I have never\nfelt since.(83) It was like a revelation; and although the\nimmediate feelings passed away, the experience has made me\nsympathetic with the morbid feelings of others ever since. It\ngradually faded, but for months I was unable to go out into the\ndark alone.\n\u201cIn general I dreaded to be left alone. I remember wondering how\nother people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so\nunconscious of that pit of insecurity beneath the surface of life.\nMy mother in particular, a very cheerful person, seemed to me a\nperfect paradox in her unconsciousness of danger, which you may\nwell believe I was very careful not to disturb by revelations of\nmy own state of mind. I have always thought that this experience\nof melancholia of mine had a religious bearing.\u201d\nOn asking this correspondent to explain more fully what he meant by these\nlast words, the answer he wrote was this:\u2014\n\u201cI mean that the fear was so invasive and powerful that if I had\nnot clung to scripture\u2010texts like \u2018The eternal God is my refuge,\u2019\netc., \u2018Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy\u2010laden,\u2019 etc.,\n\u2018I am the resurrection and the life,\u2019 etc., I think I should have\ngrown really insane.\u201d(84)\nThere is no need of more examples. The cases we have looked at are enough.\nOne of them gives us the vanity of mortal things; another the sense of\nsin; and the remaining one describes the fear of the universe;\u2014and in one\nor other of these three ways it always is that man\u2019s original optimism and\nself\u2010satisfaction get leveled with the dust.\nIn none of these cases was there any intellectual insanity or delusion\nabout matters of fact; but were we disposed to open the chapter of really\ninsane melancholia, with its hallucinations and delusions, it would be a\nworse story still\u2014desperation absolute and complete, the whole universe\ncoagulating about the sufferer into a material of overwhelming horror,\nsurrounding him without opening or end. Not the conception or intellectual\nperception of evil, but the grisly blood\u2010freezing heart\u2010palsying sensation\nof it close upon one, and no other conception or sensation able to live\nfor a moment in its presence. How irrelevantly remote seem all our usual\nrefined optimisms and intellectual and moral consolations in presence of a\nneed of help like this! Here is the real core of the religious problem:\nHelp! help! No prophet can claim to bring a final message unless he says\nthings that will have a sound of reality in the ears of victims such as\nthese. But the deliverance must come in as strong a form as the complaint,\nif it is to take effect; and that seems a reason why the coarser\nreligions, revivalistic, orgiastic, with blood and miracles and\nsupernatural operations, may possibly never be displaced. Some\nconstitutions need them too much.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nArrived at this point, we can see how great an antagonism may naturally\narise between the healthy\u2010minded way of viewing life and the way that\ntakes all this experience of evil as something essential. To this latter\nway, the morbid\u2010minded way, as we might call it, healthy\u2010mindedness pure\nand simple seems unspeakably blind and shallow. To the healthy\u2010minded way,\non the other hand, the way of the sick soul seems unmanly and diseased.\nWith their grubbing in rat\u2010holes instead of living in the light; with\ntheir manufacture of fears, and preoccupation with every unwholesome kind\nof misery, there is something almost obscene about these children of wrath\nand cravers of a second birth. If religious intolerance and hanging and\nburning could again become the order of the day, there is little doubt\nthat, however it may have been in the past, the healthy\u2010minded would at\npresent show themselves the less indulgent party of the two.\nIn our own attitude, not yet abandoned, of impartial onlookers, what are\nwe to say of this quarrel? It seems to me that we are bound to say that\nmorbid\u2010mindedness ranges over the wider scale of experience, and that its\nsurvey is the one that overlaps. The method of averting one\u2019s attention\nfrom evil, and living simply in the light of good is splendid as long as\nit will work. It will work with many persons; it will work far more\ngenerally than most of us are ready to suppose; and within the sphere of\nits successful operation there is nothing to be said against it as a\nreligious solution. But it breaks down impotently as soon as melancholy\ncomes; and even though one be quite free from melancholy one\u2019s self, there\nis no doubt that healthy\u2010mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical\ndoctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account\nfor are a genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best\nkey to life\u2019s significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to\nthe deepest levels of truth.\nThe normal process of life contains moments as bad as any of those which\ninsane melancholy is filled with, moments in which radical evil gets its\ninnings and takes its solid turn. The lunatic\u2019s visions of horror are all\ndrawn from the material of daily fact. Our civilization is founded on the\nshambles, and every individual existence goes out in a lonely spasm of\nhelpless agony. If you protest, my friend, wait till you arrive there\nyourself! To believe in the carnivorous reptiles of geologic times is hard\nfor our imagination\u2014they seem too much like mere museum specimens. Yet\nthere is no tooth in any one of those museum\u2010skulls that did not daily\nthrough long years of the foretime hold fast to the body struggling in\ndespair of some fated living victim. Forms of horror just as dreadful to\ntheir victims, if on a smaller spatial scale, fill the world about us to\u2010\nday. Here on our very hearths and in our gardens the infernal cat plays\nwith the panting mouse, or holds the hot bird fluttering in her jaws.\nCrocodiles and rattlesnakes and pythons are at this moment vessels of life\nas real as we are; their loathsome existence fills every minute of every\nday that drags its length along; and whenever they or other wild beasts\nclutch their living prey, the deadly horror which an agitated melancholiac\nfeels is the literally right reaction on the situation.(85)\nIt may indeed be that no religious reconciliation with the absolute\ntotality of things is possible. Some evils, indeed, are ministerial to\nhigher forms of good; but it may be that there are forms of evil so\nextreme as to enter into no good system whatsoever, and that, in respect\nof such evil, dumb submission or neglect to notice is the only practical\nresource. This question must confront us on a later day. But\nprovisionally, and as a mere matter of program and method, since the evil\nfacts are as genuine parts of nature as the good ones, the philosophic\npresumption should be that they have some rational significance, and that\nsystematic healthy\u2010mindedness, failing as it does to accord to sorrow,\npain, and death any positive and active attention whatever, is formally\nless complete than systems that try at least to include these elements in\ntheir scope.\nThe completest religions would therefore seem to be those in which the\npessimistic elements are best developed. Buddhism, of course, and\nChristianity are the best known to us of these. They are essentially\nreligions of deliverance: the man must die to an unreal life before he can\nbe born into the real life. In my next lecture, I will try to discuss some\nof the psychological conditions of this second birth. Fortunately from now\nonward we shall have to deal with more cheerful subjects than those which\nwe have recently been dwelling on.\nLECTURE VIII. THE DIVIDED SELF, AND THE PROCESS OF ITS UNIFICATION.\nThe last lecture was a painful one, dealing as it did with evil as a\npervasive element of the world we live in. At the close of it we were\nbrought into full view of the contrast between the two ways of looking at\nlife which are characteristic respectively of what we called the healthy\u2010\nminded, who need to be born only once, and of the sick souls, who must be\ntwice\u2010born in order to be happy. The result is two different conceptions\nof the universe of our experience. In the religion of the once\u2010born the\nworld is a sort of rectilinear or one\u2010storied affair, whose accounts are\nkept in one denomination, whose parts have just the values which naturally\nthey appear to have, and of which a simple algebraic sum of pluses and\nminuses will give the total worth. Happiness and religious peace consist\nin living on the plus side of the account. In the religion of the twice\u2010\nborn, on the other hand, the world is a double\u2010storied mystery. Peace\ncannot be reached by the simple addition of pluses and elimination of\nminuses from life. Natural good is not simply insufficient in amount and\ntransient, there lurks a falsity in its very being. Cancelled as it all is\nby death if not by earlier enemies, it gives no final balance, and can\nnever be the thing intended for our lasting worship. It keeps us from our\nreal good, rather; and renunciation and despair of it are our first step\nin the direction of the truth. There are two lives, the natural and the\nspiritual, and we must lose the one before we can participate in the\nother.\nIn their extreme forms, of pure naturalism and pure salvationism, the two\ntypes are violently contrasted; though here as in most other current\nclassifications, the radical extremes are somewhat ideal abstractions, and\nthe concrete human beings whom we oftenest meet are intermediate varieties\nand mixtures. Practically, however, you all recognize the difference: you\nunderstand, for example, the disdain of the methodist convert for the mere\nsky\u2010blue healthy\u2010minded moralist; and you likewise enter into the aversion\nof the latter to what seems to him the diseased subjectivism of the\nMethodist, dying to live, as he calls it, and making of paradox and the\ninversion of natural appearances the essence of God\u2019s truth.(86)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe psychological basis of the twice\u2010born character seems to be a certain\ndiscordancy or heterogeneity in the native temperament of the subject, an\nincompletely unified moral and intellectual constitution.\n\u201cHomo duplex, homo duplex!\u201d writes Alphonse Daudet. \u201cThe first\ntime that I perceived that I was two was at the death of my\nbrother Henri, when my father cried out so dramatically, \u2018He is\ndead, he is dead!\u2019 While my first self wept, my second self\nthought, \u2018How truly given was that cry, how fine it would be at\nthe theatre.\u2019 I was then fourteen years old.\n\u201cThis horrible duality has often given me matter for reflection.\nOh, this terrible second me, always seated whilst the other is on\nfoot, acting, living, suffering, bestirring itself. This second me\nthat I have never been able to intoxicate, to make shed tears, or\nput to sleep. And how it sees into things, and how it mocks!\u201d(87)\nRecent works on the psychology of character have had much to say upon this\npoint.(88) Some persons are born with an inner constitution which is\nharmonious and well balanced from the outset. Their impulses are\nconsistent with one another, their will follows without trouble the\nguidance of their intellect, their passions are not excessive, and their\nlives are little haunted by regrets. Others are oppositely constituted;\nand are so in degrees which may vary from something so slight as to result\nin a merely odd or whimsical inconsistency, to a discordancy of which the\nconsequences may be inconvenient in the extreme. Of the more innocent\nkinds of heterogeneity I find a good example in Mrs. Annie Besant\u2019s\nautobiography.\n\u201cI have ever been the queerest mixture of weakness and strength,\nand have paid heavily for the weakness. As a child I used to\nsuffer tortures of shyness, and if my shoe\u2010lace was untied would\nfeel shamefacedly that every eye was fixed on the unlucky string;\nas a girl I would shrink away from strangers and think myself\nunwanted and unliked, so that I was full of eager gratitude to any\none who noticed me kindly; as the young mistress of a house I was\nafraid of my servants, and would let careless work pass rather\nthan bear the pain of reproving the ill\u2010doer; when I have been\nlecturing and debating with no lack of spirit on the platform, I\nhave preferred to go without what I wanted at the hotel rather\nthan to ring and make the waiter fetch it. Combative on the\nplatform in defense of any cause I cared for, I shrink from\nquarrel or disapproval in the house, and am a coward at heart in\nprivate while a good fighter in public. How often have I passed\nunhappy quarters of an hour screwing up my courage to find fault\nwith some subordinate whom my duty compelled me to reprove, and\nhow often have I jeered at myself for a fraud as the doughty\nplatform combatant, when shrinking from blaming some lad or lass\nfor doing their work badly. An unkind look or word has availed to\nmake me shrink into myself as a snail into its shell, while, on\nthe platform, opposition makes me speak my best.\u201d(89)\nThis amount of inconsistency will only count as amiable weakness; but a\nstronger degree of heterogeneity may make havoc of the subject\u2019s life.\nThere are persons whose existence is little more than a series of zigzags,\nas now one tendency and now another gets the upper hand. Their spirit wars\nwith their flesh, they wish for incompatibles, wayward impulses interrupt\ntheir most deliberate plans, and their lives are one long drama of\nrepentance and of effort to repair misdemeanors and mistakes.\nHeterogeneous personality has been explained as the result of\ninheritance\u2014the traits of character of incompatible and antagonistic\nancestors are supposed to be preserved alongside of each other.(90) This\nexplanation may pass for what it is worth\u2014it certainly needs\ncorroboration. But whatever the cause of heterogeneous personality may be,\nwe find the extreme examples of it in the psychopathic temperament, of\nwhich I spoke in my first lecture. All writers about that temperament make\nthe inner heterogeneity prominent in their descriptions. Frequently,\nindeed, it is only this trait that leads us to ascribe that temperament to\na man at all. A \u201cd\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieur\u201d is simply a man of sensibility in\nmany directions, who finds more difficulty than is common in keeping his\nspiritual house in order and running his furrow straight, because his\nfeelings and impulses are too keen and too discrepant mutually. In the\nhaunting and insistent ideas, in the irrational impulses, the morbid\nscruples, dreads, and inhibitions which beset the psychopathic temperament\nwhen it is thoroughly pronounced, we have exquisite examples of\nheterogeneous personality. Bunyan had an obsession of the words, \u201cSell\nChrist for this, sell him for that, sell him, sell him!\u201d which would run\nthrough his mind a hundred times together, until one day out of breath\nwith retorting, \u201cI will not, I will not,\u201d he impulsively said, \u201cLet him go\nif he will,\u201d and this loss of the battle kept him in despair for over a\nyear. The lives of the saints are full of such blasphemous obsessions,\nascribed invariably to the direct agency of Satan. The phenomenon connects\nitself with the life of the subconscious self, so\u2010called, of which we must\nere\u2010long speak more directly.\nNow in all of us, however constituted, but to a degree the greater in\nproportion as we are intense and sensitive and subject to diversified\ntemptations, and to the greatest possible degree if we are decidedly\npsychopathic, does the normal evolution of character chiefly consist in\nthe straightening out and unifying of the inner self. The higher and the\nlower feelings, the useful and the erring impulses, begin by being a\ncomparative chaos within us\u2014they must end by forming a stable system of\nfunctions in right subordination. Unhappiness is apt to characterize the\nperiod of order\u2010making and struggle. If the individual be of tender\nconscience and religiously quickened, the unhappiness will take the form\nof moral remorse and compunction, of feeling inwardly vile and wrong, and\nof standing in false relations to the author of one\u2019s being and appointer\nof one\u2019s spiritual fate. This is the religious melancholy and \u201cconviction\nof sin\u201d that have played so large a part in the history of Protestant\nChristianity. The man\u2019s interior is a battle\u2010ground for what he feels to\nbe two deadly hostile selves, one actual, the other ideal. As Victor Hugo\nmakes his Mahomet say:\u2014\n\u201cJe suis le champ vil des sublimes combats:\nTant\u00f4t l\u2019homme d\u2019en haut, et tant\u00f4t l\u2019homme d\u2019en bas;\nEt le mal dans ma bouche avec le bien alterne,\nComme dans le d\u00e9sert le sable et la citerne.\u201d\nWrong living, impotent aspirations; \u201cWhat I would, that do I not; but what\nI hate, that do I,\u201d as Saint Paul says; self\u2010loathing, self\u2010despair; an\nunintelligible and intolerable burden to which one is mysteriously the\nheir.\nLet me quote from some typical cases of discordant personality, with\nmelancholy in the form of self\u2010condemnation and sense of sin. Saint\nAugustine\u2019s case is a classic example. You all remember his half\u2010pagan,\nhalf\u2010Christian bringing up at Carthage, his emigration to Rome and Milan,\nhis adoption of Manicheism and subsequent skepticism, and his restless\nsearch for truth and purity of life; and finally how, distracted by the\nstruggle between the two souls in his breast, and ashamed of his own\nweakness of will, when so many others whom he knew and knew of had thrown\noff the shackles of sensuality and dedicated themselves to chastity and\nthe higher life, he heard a voice in the garden say, \u201c_Sume, lege_\u201d (take\nand read), and opening the Bible at random, saw the text, \u201cnot in\nchambering and wantonness,\u201d etc., which seemed directly sent to his\naddress, and laid the inner storm to rest forever.(91) Augustine\u2019s\npsychological genius has given an account of the trouble of having a\ndivided self which has never been surpassed.\n\u201cThe new will which I began to have was not yet strong enough to\novercome that other will, strengthened by long indulgence. So\nthese two wills, one old, one new, one carnal, the other\nspiritual, contended with each other and disturbed my soul. I\nunderstood by my own experience what I had read, \u2018flesh lusteth\nagainst spirit, and spirit against flesh.\u2019 It was myself indeed in\nboth the wills, yet more myself in that which I approved in myself\nthan in that which I disapproved in myself. Yet it was through\nmyself that habit had attained so fierce a mastery over me,\nbecause I had willingly come whither I willed not. Still bound to\nearth, I refused, O God, to fight on thy side, as much afraid to\nbe freed from all bonds, as I ought to have feared being trammeled\nby them.\n\u201cThus the thoughts by which I meditated upon thee were like the\nefforts of one who would awake, but being overpowered with\nsleepiness is soon asleep again. Often does a man when heavy\nsleepiness is on his limbs defer to shake it off, and though not\napproving it, encourage it; even so I was sure it was better to\nsurrender to thy love than to yield to my own lusts, yet, though\nthe former course convinced me, the latter pleased and held me\nbound. There was naught in me to answer thy call, \u2018Awake, thou\nsleeper,\u2019 but only drawling, drowsy words, \u2018Presently; yes,\npresently; wait a little while.\u2019 But the \u2018presently\u2019 had no\n\u2018present,\u2019 and the \u2018little while\u2019 grew long.... For I was afraid\nthou wouldst hear me too soon, and heal me at once of my disease\nof lust, which I wished to satiate rather than to see\nextinguished. With what lashes of words did I not scourge my own\nsoul. Yet it shrank back; it refused, though it had no excuse to\noffer.... I said within myself: \u2018Come, let it be done now,\u2019 and as\nI said it, I was on the point of the resolve. I all but did it,\nyet I did not do it. And I made another effort, and almost\nsucceeded, yet I did not reach it, and did not grasp it,\nhesitating to die to death, and live to life; and the evil to\nwhich I was so wonted held me more than the better life I had not\ntried.\u201d(92)\nThere could be no more perfect description of the divided will, when the\nhigher wishes lack just that last acuteness, that touch of explosive\nintensity, of dynamogenic quality (to use the slang of the psychologists),\nthat enables them to burst their shell, and make irruption efficaciously\ninto life and quell the lower tendencies forever. In a later lecture we\nshall have much to say about this higher excitability.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI find another good description of the divided will in the autobiography\nof Henry Alline, the Nova Scotian evangelist, of whose melancholy I read a\nbrief account in my last lecture. The poor youth\u2019s sins were, as you will\nsee, of the most harmless order, yet they interfered with what proved to\nbe his truest vocation, so they gave him great distress.\n\u201cI was now very moral in my life, but found no rest of conscience.\nI now began to be esteemed in young company, who knew nothing of\nmy mind all this while, and their esteem began to be a snare to my\nsoul, for I soon began to be fond of carnal mirth, though I still\nflattered myself that if I did not get drunk, nor curse, nor\nswear, there would be no sin in frolicking and carnal mirth, and I\nthought God would indulge young people with some (what I called\nsimple or civil) recreation. I still kept a round of duties, and\nwould not suffer myself to run into any open vices, and so got\nalong very well in time of health and prosperity, but when I was\ndistressed or threatened by sickness, death, or heavy storms of\nthunder, my religion would not do, and I found there was something\nwanting, and would begin to repent my going so much to frolics,\nbut when the distress was over, the devil and my own wicked heart,\nwith the solicitations of my associates, and my fondness for young\ncompany, were such strong allurements, I would again give way, and\nthus I got to be very wild and rude, at the same time kept up my\nrounds of secret prayer and reading; but God, not willing I should\ndestroy myself, still followed me with his calls, and moved with\nsuch power upon my conscience, that I could not satisfy myself\nwith my diversions, and in the midst of my mirth sometimes would\nhave such a sense of my lost and undone condition, that I would\nwish myself from the company, and after it was over, when I went\nhome, would make many promises that I would attend no more on\nthese frolics, and would beg forgiveness for hours and hours; but\nwhen I came to have the temptation again, I would give way: no\nsooner would I hear the music and drink a glass of wine, but I\nwould find my mind elevated and soon proceed to any sort of\nmerriment or diversion, that I thought was not debauched or openly\nvicious; but when I returned from my carnal mirth I felt as guilty\nas ever, and could sometimes not close my eyes for some hours\nafter I had gone to my bed. I was one of the most unhappy\ncreatures on earth.\n\u201cSometimes I would leave the company (often speaking to the\nfiddler to cease from playing, as if I was tired), and go out and\nwalk about crying and praying, as if my very heart would break,\nand beseeching God that he would not cut me off, nor give me up to\nhardness of heart. Oh, what unhappy hours and nights I thus wore\naway! When I met sometimes with merry companions, and my heart was\nready to sink, I would labor to put on as cheerful a countenance\nas possible, that they might not distrust anything, and sometimes\nwould begin some discourse with young men or young women on\npurpose, or propose a merry song, lest the distress of my soul\nwould be discovered, or mistrusted, when at the same time I would\nthen rather have been in a wilderness in exile, than with them or\nany of their pleasures or enjoyments. Thus for many months when I\nwas in company, I would act the hypocrite and feign a merry heart,\nbut at the same time would endeavor as much as I could to shun\ntheir company, oh wretched and unhappy mortal that I was!\nEverything I did, and wherever I went, I was still in a storm, and\nyet I continued to be the chief contriver and ringleader of the\nfrolics for many months after; though it was a toil and torment to\nattend them; but the devil and my own wicked heart drove me about\nlike a slave, telling me that I must do this and do that, and bear\nthis and bear that, and turn here and turn there, to keep my\ncredit up, and retain the esteem of my associates: and all this\nwhile I continued as strict as possible in my duties, and left no\nstone unturned to pacify my conscience, watching even against my\nthoughts, and praying continually wherever I went: for I did not\nthink there was any sin in my conduct, when I was among carnal\ncompany, because I did not take any satisfaction there, but only\nfollowed it, I thought, for sufficient reasons.\n\u201cBut still, all that I did or could do, conscience would roar\nnight and day.\u201d\nSaint Augustine and Alline both emerged into the smooth waters of inner\nunity and peace, and I shall next ask you to consider more closely some of\nthe peculiarities of the process of unification, when it occurs. It may\ncome gradually, or it may occur abruptly; it may come through altered\nfeelings, or through altered powers of action; or it may come through new\nintellectual insights, or through experiences which we shall later have to\ndesignate as \u201cmystical.\u201d However it come, it brings a characteristic sort\nof relief; and never such extreme relief as when it is cast into the\nreligious mould. Happiness! happiness! religion is only one of the ways in\nwhich men gain that gift. Easily, permanently, and successfully, it often\ntransforms the most intolerable misery into the profoundest and most\nenduring happiness.\nBut to find religion is only one out of many ways of reaching unity; and\nthe process of remedying inner incompleteness and reducing inner discord\nis a general psychological process, which may take place with any sort of\nmental material, and need not necessarily assume the religious form. In\njudging of the religious types of regeneration which we are about to\nstudy, it is important to recognize that they are only one species of a\ngenus that contains other types as well. For example, the new birth may be\naway from religion into incredulity; or it may be from moral scrupulosity\ninto freedom and license; or it may be produced by the irruption into the\nindividual\u2019s life of some new stimulus or passion, such as love, ambition,\ncupidity, revenge, or patriotic devotion. In all these instances we have\nprecisely the same psychological form of event,\u2014a firmness, stability, and\nequilibrium succeeding a period of storm and stress and inconsistency. In\nthese non\u2010religious cases the new man may also be born either gradually or\nsuddenly.\nThe French philosopher Jouffroy has left an eloquent memorial of his own\n\u201ccounter\u2010conversion,\u201d as the transition from orthodoxy to infidelity has\nbeen well styled by Mr. Starbuck. Jouffroy\u2019s doubts had long harassed him;\nbut he dates his final crisis from a certain night when his disbelief grew\nfixed and stable, and where the immediate result was sadness at the\nillusions he had lost.\n\u201cI shall never forget that night of December,\u201d writes Jouffroy,\n\u201cin which the veil that concealed from me my own incredulity was\ntorn. I hear again my steps in that narrow naked chamber where\nlong after the hour of sleep had come I had the habit of walking\nup and down. I see again that moon, half\u2010veiled by clouds, which\nnow and again illuminated the frigid window\u2010panes. The hours of\nthe night flowed on and I did not note their passage. Anxiously I\nfollowed my thoughts, as from layer to layer they descended\ntowards the foundation of my consciousness, and, scattering one by\none all the illusions which until then had screened its windings\nfrom my view, made them every moment more clearly visible.\n\u201cVainly I clung to these last beliefs as a shipwrecked sailor\nclings to the fragments of his vessel; vainly, frightened at the\nunknown void in which I was about to float, I turned with them\ntowards my childhood, my family, my country, all that was dear and\nsacred to me: the inflexible current of my thought was too\nstrong,\u2014parents, family, memory, beliefs, it forced me to let go\nof everything. The investigation went on more obstinate and more\nsevere as it drew near its term, and did not stop until the end\nwas reached. I knew then that in the depth of my mind nothing was\nleft that stood erect.\n\u201cThis moment was a frightful one; and when towards morning I threw\nmyself exhausted on my bed, I seemed to feel my earlier life, so\nsmiling and so full, go out like a fire, and before me another\nlife opened, sombre and unpeopled, where in future I must live\nalone, alone with my fatal thought which had exiled me thither,\nand which I was tempted to curse. The days which followed this\ndiscovery were the saddest of my life.\u201d(93)\nIn John Foster\u2019s Essay on Decision of Character, there is an account of a\ncase of sudden conversion to avarice, which is illustrative enough to\nquote:\u2014\nA young man, it appears, \u201cwasted, in two or three years, a large\npatrimony in profligate revels with a number of worthless\nassociates who called themselves his friends, and who, when his\nlast means were exhausted, treated him of course with neglect or\ncontempt. Reduced to absolute want, he one day went out of the\nhouse with an intention to put an end to his life; but wandering\nawhile almost unconsciously, he came to the brow of an eminence\nwhich overlooked what were lately his estates. Here he sat down,\nand remained fixed in thought a number of hours, at the end of\nwhich he sprang from the ground with a vehement, exulting emotion.\nHe had formed his resolution, which was, that all these estates\nshould be his again; he had formed his plan, too, which he\ninstantly began to execute. He walked hastily forward, determined\nto seize the first opportunity, of however humble a kind, to gain\nany money, though it were ever so despicable a trifle, and\nresolved absolutely not to spend, if he could help it, a farthing\nof whatever he might obtain. The first thing that drew his\nattention was a heap of coals shot out of carts on the pavement\nbefore a house. He offered himself to shovel or wheel them into\nthe place where they were to be laid, and was employed. He\nreceived a few pence for the labor; and then, in pursuance of the\nsaving part of his plan, requested some small gratuity of meat and\ndrink, which was given him. He then looked out for the next thing\nthat might chance; and went, with indefatigable industry, through\na succession of servile employments in different places, of longer\nand shorter duration, still scrupulous in avoiding, as far as\npossible, the expense of a penny. He promptly seized every\nopportunity which could advance his design, without regarding the\nmeanness of occupation or appearance. By this method he had\ngained, after a considerable time, money enough to purchase in\norder to sell again a few cattle, of which he had taken pains to\nunderstand the value. He speedily but cautiously turned his first\ngains into second advantages; retained without a single deviation\nhis extreme parsimony; and thus advanced by degrees into larger\ntransactions and incipient wealth. I did not hear, or have\nforgotten, the continued course of his life, but the final result\nwas, that he more than recovered his lost possessions, and died an\ninveterate miser, worth \u00a360,000.\u201d(94)\nLet me turn now to the kind of case, the religious case, namely, that\nimmediately concerns us. Here is one of the simplest possible type, an\naccount of the conversion to the systematic religion of healthy\u2010mindedness\nof a man who must already have been naturally of the healthy\u2010minded type.\nIt shows how, when the fruit is ripe, a touch will make it fall.\nMr. Horace Fletcher, in his little book called Menticulture, relates that\na friend with whom he was talking of the self\u2010control attained by the\nJapanese through their practice of the Buddhist discipline said:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018You must first get rid of anger and worry.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018is\nthat possible?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 replied he; \u2018it is possible to the\nJapanese, and ought to be possible to us.\u2019\n\u201cOn my way back I could think of nothing else but the words \u2018get\nrid, get rid\u2019; and the idea must have continued to possess me\nduring my sleeping hours, for the first consciousness in the\nmorning brought back the same thought, with the revelation of a\ndiscovery, which framed itself into the reasoning, \u2018If it is\npossible to get rid of anger and worry, why is it necessary to\nhave them at all?\u2019 I felt the strength of the argument, and at\nonce accepted the reasoning. The baby had discovered that it could\nwalk. It would scorn to creep any longer.\n\u201cFrom the instant I realized that these cancer spots of worry and\nanger were removable, they left me. With the discovery of their\nweakness they were exorcised. From that time life has had an\nentirely different aspect.\n\u201cAlthough from that moment the possibility and desirability of\nfreedom from the depressing passions has been a reality to me, it\ntook me some months to feel absolute security in my new position;\nbut, as the usual occasions for worry and anger have presented\nthemselves over and over again, and I have been unable to feel\nthem in the slightest degree, I no longer dread or guard against\nthem, and I am amazed at my increased energy and vigor of mind; at\nmy strength to meet situations of all kinds, and at my disposition\nto love and appreciate everything.\n\u201cI have had occasion to travel more than ten thousand miles by\nrail since that morning. The same Pullman porter, conductor,\nhotel\u2010waiter, peddler, book\u2010agent, cabman, and others who were\nformerly a source of annoyance and irritation have been met, but I\nam not conscious of a single incivility. All at once the whole\nworld has turned good to me. I have become, as it were, sensitive\nonly to the rays of good.\n\u201cI could recount many experiences which prove a brand\u2010new\ncondition of mind, but one will be sufficient. Without the\nslightest feeling of annoyance or impatience, I have seen a train\nthat I had planned to take with a good deal of interested and\npleasurable anticipation move out of the station without me,\nbecause my baggage did not arrive. The porter from the hotel came\nrunning and panting into the station just as the train pulled out\nof sight. When he saw me, he looked as if he feared a scolding,\nand began to tell of being blocked in a crowded street and unable\nto get out. When he had finished, I said to him: \u2018It doesn\u2019t\nmatter at all, you couldn\u2019t help it, so we will try again to\u2010\nmorrow. Here is your fee, I am sorry you had all this trouble in\nearning it.\u2019 The look of surprise that came over his face was so\nfilled with pleasure that I was repaid on the spot for the delay\nin my departure. Next day he would not accept a cent for the\nservice, and he and I are friends for life.\n\u201cDuring the first weeks of my experience I was on guard only\nagainst worry and anger; but, in the mean time, having noticed the\nabsence of the other depressing and dwarfing passions, I began to\ntrace a relationship, until I was convinced that they are all\ngrowths from the two roots I have specified. I have felt the\nfreedom now for so long a time that I am sure of my relation\ntoward it; and I could no more harbor any of the thieving and\ndepressing influences that once I nursed as a heritage of humanity\nthan a fop would voluntarily wallow in a filthy gutter.\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that pure Christianity and pure\nBuddhism, and the Mental Sciences and all Religions, fundamentally\nteach what has been a discovery to me; but none of them have\npresented it in the light of a simple and easy process of\nelimination. At one time I wondered if the elimination would not\nyield to indifference and sloth. In my experience, the contrary is\nthe result. I feel such an increased desire to do something useful\nthat it seems as if I were a boy again and the energy for play had\nreturned. I could fight as readily as (and better than) ever, if\nthere were occasion for it. It does not make one a coward. It\ncan\u2019t, since fear is one of the things eliminated. I notice the\nabsence of timidity in the presence of any audience. When a boy, I\nwas standing under a tree which was struck by lightning, and\nreceived a shock from the effects of which I never knew exemption\nuntil I had dissolved partnership with worry. Since then,\nlightning and thunder have been encountered under conditions which\nwould formerly have caused great depression and discomfort,\nwithout [my] experiencing a trace of either. Surprise is also\ngreatly modified, and one is less liable to become startled by\nunexpected sights or noises.\n\u201cAs far as I am individually concerned, I am not bothering myself\nat present as to what the results of this emancipated condition\nmay be. I have no doubt that the perfect health aimed at by\nChristian Science may be one of the possibilities, for I note a\nmarked improvement in the way my stomach does its duty in\nassimilating the food I give it to handle, and I am sure it works\nbetter to the sound of a song than under the friction of a frown.\nNeither am I wasting any of this precious time formulating an idea\nof a future existence or a future Heaven. The Heaven that I have\nwithin myself is as attractive as any that has been promised or\nthat I can imagine; and I am willing to let the growth lead where\nit will, as long as the anger and their brood have no part in\nmisguiding it.\u201d(95)\nThe older medicine used to speak of two ways, _lysis_ and _crisis_, one\ngradual, the other abrupt, in which one might recover from a bodily\ndisease. In the spiritual realm there are also two ways, one gradual, the\nother sudden, in which inner unification may occur. Tolstoy and Bunyan may\nagain serve us as examples, examples, as it happens, of the gradual way,\nthough it must be confessed at the outset that it is hard to follow these\nwindings of the hearts of others, and one feels that their words do not\nreveal their total secret.\nHowe\u2019er this be, Tolstoy, pursuing his unending questioning, seemed to\ncome to one insight after another. First he perceived that his conviction\nthat life was meaningless took only this finite life into account. He was\nlooking for the value of one finite term in that of another, and the whole\nresult could only be one of those indeterminate equations in mathematics\nwhich end with 0=0. Yet this is as far as the reasoning intellect by\nitself can go, unless irrational sentiment or faith brings in the\ninfinite. Believe in the infinite as common people do, and life grows\npossible again.\n\u201cSince mankind has existed, wherever life has been, there also has\nbeen the faith that gave the possibility of living. Faith is the\nsense of life, that sense by virtue of which man does not destroy\nhimself, but continues to live on. It is the force whereby we\nlive. If Man did not believe that he must live for something, he\nwould not live at all. The idea of an infinite God, of the\ndivinity of the soul, of the union of men\u2019s actions with God\u2014these\nare ideas elaborated in the infinite secret depths of human\nthought. They are ideas without which there would be no life,\nwithout which I myself,\u201d said Tolstoy, \u201cwould not exist. I began\nto see that I had no right to rely on my individual reasoning and\nneglect these answers given by faith, for they are the only\nanswers to the question.\u201d\nYet how believe as the common people believe, steeped as they are in\ngrossest superstition? It is impossible,\u2014but yet their life! their life!\nIt is normal. It is happy! It is an answer to the question!\nLittle by little, Tolstoy came to the settled conviction\u2014he says it took\nhim two years to arrive there\u2014that his trouble had not been with life in\ngeneral, not with the common life of common men, but with the life of the\nupper, intellectual, artistic classes, the life which he had personally\nalways led, the cerebral life, the life of conventionality, artificiality,\nand personal ambition. He had been living wrongly and must change. To work\nfor animal needs, to abjure lies and vanities, to relieve common wants, to\nbe simple, to believe in God, therein lay happiness again.\n\u201cI remember,\u201d he says, \u201cone day in early spring, I was alone in\nthe forest, lending my ear to its mysterious noises. I listened,\nand my thought went back to what for these three years it always\nwas busy with\u2014the quest of God. But the idea of him, I said, how\ndid I ever come by the idea?\n\u201cAnd again there arose in me, with this thought, glad aspirations\ntowards life. Everything in me awoke and received a meaning....\nWhy do I look farther? a voice within me asked. He is there: he,\nwithout whom one cannot live. To acknowledge God and to live are\none and the same thing. God is what life is. Well, then! live,\nseek God, and there will be no life without him....\n\u201cAfter this, things cleared up within me and about me better than\never, and the light has never wholly died away. I was saved from\nsuicide. Just how or when the change took place I cannot tell. But\nas insensibly and gradually as the force of life had been annulled\nwithin me, and I had reached my moral death\u2010bed, just as gradually\nand imperceptibly did the energy of life come back. And what was\nstrange was that this energy that came back was nothing new. It\nwas my ancient juvenile force of faith, the belief that the sole\npurpose of my life was to be _better_. I gave up the life of the\nconventional world, recognizing it to be no life, but a parody on\nlife, which its superfluities simply keep us from\ncomprehending,\u201d\u2014and Tolstoy thereupon embraced the life of the\npeasants, and has felt right and happy, or at least relatively so,\never since.(96)\nAs I interpret his melancholy, then, it was not merely an accidental\nvitiation of his humors, though it was doubtless also that. It was\nlogically called for by the clash between his inner character and his\nouter activities and aims. Although a literary artist, Tolstoy was one of\nthose primitive oaks of men to whom the superfluities and insincerities,\nthe cupidities, complications, and cruelties of our polite civilization\nare profoundly unsatisfying, and for whom the eternal veracities lie with\nmore natural and animal things. His crisis was the getting of his soul in\norder, the discovery of its genuine habitat and vocation, the escape from\nfalsehoods into what for him were ways of truth. It was a case of\nheterogeneous personality tardily and slowly finding its unity and level.\nAnd though not many of us can imitate Tolstoy, not having enough, perhaps,\nof the aboriginal human marrow in our bones, most of us may at least feel\nas if it might be better for us if we could.\nBunyan\u2019s recovery seems to have been even slower. For years together he\nwas alternately haunted with texts of Scripture, now up and now down, but\nat last with an ever growing relief in his salvation through the blood of\nChrist.\n\u201cMy peace would be in and out twenty times a day; comfort now and\ntrouble presently; peace now and before I could go a furlong as\nfull of guilt and fear as ever heart could hold.\u201d When a good text\ncomes home to him, \u201cThis,\u201d he writes, \u201cgave me good encouragement\nfor the space of two or three hours\u201d; or \u201cThis was a good day to\nme, I hope I shall not forget it\u201d; or \u201cThe glory of these words\nwas then so weighty on me that I was ready to swoon as I sat; yet\nnot with grief and trouble, but with solid joy and peace\u201d; or\n\u201cThis made a strange seizure on my spirit; it brought light with\nit, and commanded a silence in my heart of all those tumultuous\nthoughts that before did use, like masterless hell\u2010hounds, to roar\nand bellow and make a hideous noise within me. It showed me that\nJesus Christ had not quite forsaken and cast off my Soul.\u201d\nSuch periods accumulate until he can write: \u201cAnd now remained only\nthe hinder part of the tempest, for the thunder was gone beyond\nme, only some drops would still remain, that now and then would\nfall upon me\u201d;\u2014and at last: \u201cNow did my chains fall off my legs\nindeed; I was loosed from my afflictions and irons; my temptations\nalso fled away; so that from that time, those dreadful Scriptures\nof God left off to trouble me; now went I also home rejoicing, for\nthe grace and love of God.... Now could I see myself in Heaven and\nEarth at once; in Heaven by my Christ, by my Head, by my\nRighteousness and Life, though on Earth by my body or person....\nChrist was a precious Christ to my soul that night; I could scarce\nlie in my bed for joy and peace and triumph through Christ.\u201d\nBunyan became a minister of the gospel, and in spite of his neurotic\nconstitution, and of the twelve years he lay in prison for his non\u2010\nconformity, his life was turned to active use. He was a peacemaker and\ndoer of good, and the immortal Allegory which he wrote has brought the\nvery spirit of religious patience home to English hearts.\nBut neither Bunyan nor Tolstoy could become what we have called healthy\u2010\nminded. They had drunk too deeply of the cup of bitterness ever to forget\nits taste, and their redemption is into a universe two stories deep. Each\nof them realized a good which broke the effective edge of his sadness; yet\nthe sadness was preserved as a minor ingredient in the heart of the faith\nby which it was overcome. The fact of interest for us is that as a matter\nof fact they could and did find _something_ welling up in the inner\nreaches of their consciousness, by which such extreme sadness could be\novercome. Tolstoy does well to talk of it as _that by which men live_; for\nthat is exactly what it is, a stimulus, an excitement, a faith, a force\nthat re\u2010infuses the positive willingness to live, even in full presence of\nthe evil perceptions that erewhile made life seem unbearable. For\nTolstoy\u2019s perceptions of evil appear within their sphere to have remained\nunmodified. His later works show him implacable to the whole system of\nofficial values: the ignobility of fashionable life; the infamies of\nempire; the spuriousness of the church, the vain conceit of the\nprofessions; the meannesses and cruelties that go with great success; and\nevery other pompous crime and lying institution of this world. To all\npatience with such things his experience has been for him a permanent\nministry of death.\nBunyan also leaves this world to the enemy.\n\u201cI must first pass a sentence of death,\u201d he says, \u201cupon everything\nthat can properly be called a thing of this life, even to reckon\nmyself, my wife, my children, my health, my enjoyments, and all,\nas dead to me, and myself as dead to them; to trust in God through\nChrist, as touching the world to come; and as touching this world,\nto count the grave my house, to make my bed in darkness, and to\nsay to corruption, Thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou art\nmy mother and sister.... The parting with my wife and my poor\nchildren hath often been to me as the pulling of my flesh from my\nbones, especially my poor blind child who lay nearer my heart than\nall I had besides. Poor child, thought I, what sorrow art thou\nlike to have for thy portion in this world! Thou must be beaten,\nmust beg, suffer hunger, cold, nakedness, and a thousand\ncalamities, though I cannot now endure that the wind should blow\nupon thee. But yet I must venture you all with God, though it\ngoeth to the quick to leave you.\u201d(97)\nThe \u201chue of resolution\u201d is there, but the full flood of ecstatic\nliberation seems never to have poured over poor John Bunyan\u2019s soul.\nThese examples may suffice to acquaint us in a general way with the\nphenomenon technically called \u201cConversion.\u201d In the next lecture I shall\ninvite you to study its peculiarities and concomitants in some detail.\nLECTURE IX. CONVERSION.\nTo be converted, to be regenerated, to receive grace, to experience\nreligion, to gain an assurance, are so many phrases which denote the\nprocess, gradual or sudden, by which a self hitherto divided, and\nconsciously wrong inferior and unhappy, becomes unified and consciously\nright superior and happy, in consequence of its firmer hold upon religious\nrealities. This at least is what conversion signifies in general terms,\nwhether or not we believe that a direct divine operation is needed to\nbring such a moral change about.\nBefore entering upon a minuter study of the process, let me enliven our\nunderstanding of the definition by a concrete example. I choose the quaint\ncase of an unlettered man, Stephen H. Bradley, whose experience is related\nin a scarce American pamphlet.(98)\nI select this case because it shows how in these inner alterations one may\nfind one unsuspected depth below another, as if the possibilities of\ncharacter lay disposed in a series of layers or shells, of whose existence\nwe have no premonitory knowledge.\nBradley thought that he had been already fully converted at the age of\nfourteen.\n\u201cI thought I saw the Saviour, by faith, in human shape, for about\none second in the room, with arms extended, appearing to say to\nme, Come. The next day I rejoiced with trembling; soon after, my\nhappiness was so great that I said that I wanted to die; this\nworld had no place in my affections, as I knew of, and every day\nappeared as solemn to me as the Sabbath. I had an ardent desire\nthat all mankind might feel as I did; I wanted to have them all\nlove God supremely. Previous to this time I was very selfish and\nself\u2010righteous; but now I desired the welfare of all mankind, and\ncould with a feeling heart forgive my worst enemies, and I felt as\nif I should be willing to bear the scoffs and sneers of any\nperson, and suffer anything for His sake, if I could be the means\nin the hands of God, of the conversion of one soul.\u201d\nNine years later, in 1829, Mr. Bradley heard of a revival of\nreligion that had begun in his neighborhood. \u201cMany of the young\nconverts,\u201d he says, \u201cwould come to me when in meeting and ask me\nif I had religion, and my reply generally was, I hope I have. This\ndid not appear to satisfy them; they said they _knew they_ had it.\nI requested them to pray for me, thinking with myself, that if I\nhad not got religion now, after so long a time professing to be a\nChristian, that it was time I had, and hoped their prayers would\nbe answered in my behalf.\n\u201cOne Sabbath, I went to hear the Methodist at the Academy. He\nspoke of the ushering in of the day of general judgment; and he\nset it forth in such a solemn and terrible manner as I never heard\nbefore. The scene of that day appeared to be taking place, and so\nawakened were all the powers of my mind that, like Felix, I\ntrembled involuntarily on the bench where I was sitting, though I\nfelt nothing at heart. The next day evening I went to hear him\nagain. He took his text from Revelation: \u2018And I saw the dead,\nsmall and great, stand before God.\u2019 And he represented the terrors\nof that day in such a manner that it appeared as if it would melt\nthe heart of stone. When he finished his discourse, an old\ngentleman turned to me and said, \u2018This is what I call preaching.\u2019\nI thought the same; but my feelings were still unmoved by what he\nsaid, and I did not enjoy religion, but I believe he did.\n\u201cI will now relate my experience of the power of the Holy Spirit\nwhich took place on the same night. Had any person told me\nprevious to this that I could have experienced the power of the\nHoly Spirit in the manner which I did, I could not have believed\nit, and should have thought the person deluded that told me so. I\nwent directly home after the meeting, and when I got home I\nwondered what made me feel so stupid. I retired to rest soon after\nI got home, and felt indifferent to the things of religion until I\nbegan to be exercised by the Holy Spirit, which began in about\nfive minutes after, in the following manner:\u2014\n\u201cAt first, I began to feel my heart beat very quick all on a\nsudden, which made me at first think that perhaps something is\ngoing to ail me, though I was not alarmed, for I felt no pain. My\nheart increased in its beating, which soon convinced me that it\nwas the Holy Spirit from the effect it had on me. I began to feel\nexceedingly happy and humble, and such a sense of unworthiness as\nI never felt before. I could not very well help speaking out,\nwhich I did, and said, Lord, I do not deserve this happiness, or\nwords to that effect, while there was a stream (resembling air in\nfeeling) came into my mouth and heart in a more sensible manner\nthan that of drinking anything, which continued, as near as I\ncould judge, five minutes or more, which appeared to be the cause\nof such a palpitation of my heart. It took complete possession of\nmy soul, and I am certain that I desired the Lord, while in the\nmidst of it, not to give me any more happiness, for it seemed as\nif I could not contain what I had got. My heart seemed as if it\nwould burst, but it did not stop until I felt as if I was\nunutterably full of the love and grace of God. In the mean time\nwhile thus exercised, a thought arose in my mind, what can it\nmean? and all at once, as if to answer it, my memory became\nexceedingly clear, and it appeared to me just as if the New\nTestament was placed open before me, eighth chapter of Romans, and\nas light as if some candle lighted was held for me to read the\n26th and 27th verses of that chapter, and I read these words: \u2018The\nSpirit helpeth our infirmities with groanings which cannot be\nuttered.\u2019 And all the time that my heart was a\u2010beating, it made me\ngroan like a person in distress, which was not very easy to stop,\nthough I was in no pain at all, and my brother being in bed in\nanother room came and opened the door, and asked me if I had got\nthe toothache. I told him no, and that he might get to sleep. I\ntried to stop. I felt unwilling to go to sleep myself, I was so\nhappy, fearing I should lose it\u2014thinking within myself\n\u2018My willing soul would stay\nIn such a frame as this.\u2019\nAnd while I lay reflecting, after my heart stopped beating,\nfeeling as if my soul was full of the Holy Spirit, I thought that\nperhaps there might be angels hovering round my bed. I felt just\nas if I wanted to converse with them, and finally I spoke, saying,\n\u2018O ye affectionate angels! how is it that ye can take so much\ninterest in our welfare, and we take so little interest in our\nown.\u2019 After this, with difficulty I got to sleep; and when I awoke\nin the morning my first thoughts were: What has become of my\nhappiness? and, feeling a degree of it in my heart, I asked for\nmore, which was given to me as quick as thought. I then got up to\ndress myself, and found to my surprise that I could but just\nstand. It appeared to me as if it was a little heaven upon earth.\nMy soul felt as completely raised above the fears of death as of\ngoing to sleep; and like a bird in a cage, I had a desire, if it\nwas the will of God, to get released from my body and to dwell\nwith Christ, though willing to live to do good to others, and to\nwarn sinners to repent. I went downstairs feeling as solemn as if\nI had lost all my friends, and thinking with myself, that I would\nnot let my parents know it until I had first looked into the\nTestament. I went directly to the shelf and looked into it, at the\neighth chapter of Romans, and every verse seemed to almost speak\nand to confirm it to be truly the Word of God, and as if my\nfeelings corresponded with the meaning of the word. I then told my\nparents of it, and told them that I thought that they must see\nthat when I spoke, that it was not my own voice, for it appeared\nso to me. My speech seemed entirely under the control of the\nSpirit within me; I do not mean that the words which I spoke were\nnot my own, for they were. I thought that I was influenced similar\nto the Apostles on the day of Pentecost (with the exception of\nhaving power to give it to others, and doing what they did). After\nbreakfast I went round to converse with my neighbors on religion,\nwhich I could not have been hired to have done before this, and at\ntheir request I prayed with them, though I had never prayed in\npublic before.\n\u201cI now feel as if I had discharged my duty by telling the truth,\nand hope by the blessing of God, it may do some good to all who\nshall read it. He has fulfilled his promise in sending the Holy\nSpirit down into our hearts, or mine at least, and I now defy all\nthe Deists and Atheists in the world to shake my faith in Christ.\u201d\nSo much for Mr. Bradley and his conversion, of the effect of which upon\nhis later life we gain no information. Now for a minuter survey of the\nconstituent elements of the conversion process.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIf you open the chapter on Association, of any treatise on Psychology, you\nwill read that a man\u2019s ideas, aims, and objects form diverse internal\ngroups and systems, relatively independent of one another. Each \u201caim\u201d\nwhich he follows awakens a certain specific kind of interested excitement,\nand gathers a certain group of ideas together in subordination to it as\nits associates; and if the aims and excitements are distinct in kind,\ntheir groups of ideas may have little in common. When one group is present\nand engrosses the interest, all the ideas connected with other groups may\nbe excluded from the mental field. The President of the United States\nwhen, with paddle, gun, and fishing\u2010rod, he goes camping in the wilderness\nfor a vacation, changes his system of ideas from top to bottom. The\npresidential anxieties have lapsed into the background entirely; the\nofficial habits are replaced by the habits of a son of nature, and those\nwho knew the man only as the strenuous magistrate would not \u201cknow him for\nthe same person\u201d if they saw him as the camper.\nIf now he should never go back, and never again suffer political interests\nto gain dominion over him, he would be for practical intents and purposes\na permanently transformed being. Our ordinary alterations of character, as\nwe pass from one of our aims to another, are not commonly called\ntransformations, because each of them is so rapidly succeeded by another\nin the reverse direction; but whenever one aim grows so stable as to expel\ndefinitively its previous rivals from the individual\u2019s life, we tend to\nspeak of the phenomenon, and perhaps to wonder at it, as a\n\u201ctransformation.\u201d\nThese alternations are the completest of the ways in which a self may be\ndivided. A less complete way is the simultaneous coexistence of two or\nmore different groups of aims, of which one practically holds the right of\nway and instigates activity, whilst the others are only pious wishes, and\nnever practically come to anything. Saint Augustine\u2019s aspirations to a\npurer life, in our last lecture, were for a while an example. Another\nwould be the President in his full pride of office, wondering whether it\nwere not all vanity, and whether the life of a wood\u2010chopper were not the\nwholesomer destiny. Such fleeting aspirations are mere _velleitates_,\nwhimsies. They exist on the remoter outskirts of the mind, and the real\nself of the man, the centre of his energies, is occupied with an entirely\ndifferent system. As life goes on, there is a constant change of our\ninterests, and a consequent change of place in our systems of ideas, from\nmore central to more peripheral, and from more peripheral to more central\nparts of consciousness. I remember, for instance, that one evening when I\nwas a youth, my father read aloud from a Boston newspaper that part of\nLord Gifford\u2019s will which founded these four lectureships. At that time I\ndid not think of being a teacher of philosophy: and what I listened to was\nas remote from my own life as if it related to the planet Mars. Yet here I\nam, with the Gifford system part and parcel of my very self, and all my\nenergies, for the time being, devoted to successfully identifying myself\nwith it. My soul stands now planted in what once was for it a practically\nunreal object, and speaks from it as from its proper habitat and centre.\nWhen I say \u201cSoul,\u201d you need not take me in the ontological sense unless\nyou prefer to; for although ontological language is instinctive in such\nmatters, yet Buddhists or Humians can perfectly well describe the facts in\nthe phenomenal terms which are their favorites. For them the soul is only\na succession of fields of consciousness: yet there is found in each field\na part, or sub\u2010field, which figures as focal and contains the excitement,\nand from which, as from a centre, the aim seems to be taken. Talking of\nthis part, we involuntarily apply words of perspective to distinguish it\nfrom the rest, words like \u201chere,\u201d \u201cthis,\u201d \u201cnow,\u201d \u201cmine,\u201d or \u201cme\u201d; and we\nascribe to the other parts the positions \u201cthere,\u201d \u201cthen,\u201d \u201cthat,\u201d \u201chis\u201d or\n\u201cthine,\u201d \u201cit,\u201d \u201cnot me.\u201d But a \u201chere\u201d can change to a \u201cthere,\u201d and a\n\u201cthere\u201d become a \u201chere,\u201d and what was \u201cmine\u201d and what was \u201cnot mine\u201d\nchange their places.\nWhat brings such changes about is the way in which emotional excitement\nalters. Things hot and vital to us to\u2010day are cold to\u2010morrow. It is as if\nseen from the hot parts of the field that the other parts appear to us,\nand from these hot parts personal desire and volition make their sallies.\nThey are in short the centres of our dynamic energy, whereas the cold\nparts leave us indifferent and passive in proportion to their coldness.\nWhether such language be rigorously exact is for the present of no\nimportance. It is exact enough, if you recognize from your own experience\nthe facts which I seek to designate by it.\nNow there may be great oscillation in the emotional interest, and the hot\nplaces may shift before one almost as rapidly as the sparks that run\nthrough burnt\u2010up paper. Then we have the wavering and divided self we\nheard so much of in the previous lecture. Or the focus of excitement and\nheat, the point of view from which the aim is taken, may come to lie\npermanently within a certain system; and then, if the change be a\nreligious one, we call it a _conversion_, especially if it be by crisis,\nor sudden.\nLet us hereafter, in speaking of the hot place in a man\u2019s consciousness,\nthe group of ideas to which he devotes himself, and from which he works,\ncall it _the habitual centre of his personal energy_. It makes a great\ndifference to a man whether one set of his ideas, or another, be the\ncentre of his energy; and it makes a great difference, as regards any set\nof ideas which he may possess, whether they become central or remain\nperipheral in him. To say that a man is \u201cconverted\u201d means, in these terms,\nthat religious ideas, previously peripheral in his consciousness, now take\na central place, and that religious aims form the habitual centre of his\nenergy.\nNow if you ask of psychology just _how_ the excitement shifts in a man\u2019s\nmental system, and _why_ aims that were peripheral become at a certain\nmoment central, psychology has to reply that although she can give a\ngeneral description of what happens, she is unable in a given case to\naccount accurately for all the single forces at work. Neither an outside\nobserver nor the Subject who undergoes the process can explain fully how\nparticular experiences are able to change one\u2019s centre of energy so\ndecisively, or why they so often have to bide their hour to do so. We have\na thought, or we perform an act, repeatedly, but on a certain day the real\nmeaning of the thought peals through us for the first time, or the act has\nsuddenly turned into a moral impossibility. All we know is that there are\ndead feelings, dead ideas, and cold beliefs, and there are hot and live\nones; and when one grows hot and alive within us, everything has to re\u2010\ncrystallize about it. We may say that the heat and liveliness mean only\nthe \u201cmotor efficacy,\u201d long deferred but now operative, of the idea; but\nsuch talk itself is only circumlocution, for whence the sudden motor\nefficacy? And our explanations then get so vague and general that one\nrealizes all the more the intense individuality of the whole phenomenon.\nIn the end we fall back on the hackneyed symbolism of a mechanical\nequilibrium. A mind is a system of ideas, each with the excitement it\narouses, and with tendencies impulsive and inhibitive, which mutually\ncheck or reinforce one another. The collection of ideas alters by\nsubtraction or by addition in the course of experience, and the tendencies\nalter as the organism gets more aged. A mental system may be undermined or\nweakened by this interstitial alteration just as a building is, and yet\nfor a time keep upright by dead habit. But a new perception, a sudden\nemotional shock, or an occasion which lays bare the organic alteration,\nwill make the whole fabric fall together; and then the centre of gravity\nsinks into an attitude more stable, for the new ideas that reach the\ncentre in the rearrangement seem now to be locked there, and the new\nstructure remains permanent.\nFormed associations of ideas and habits are usually factors of retardation\nin such changes of equilibrium. New information, however acquired, plays\nan accelerating part in the changes; and the slow mutation of our\ninstincts and propensities, under the \u201cunimaginable touch of time\u201d has an\nenormous influence. Moreover, all these influences may work subconsciously\nor half unconsciously.(99) And when you get a Subject in whom the\nsubconscious life\u2014of which I must speak more fully soon\u2014is largely\ndeveloped, and in whom motives habitually ripen in silence, you get a case\nof which you can never give a full account, and in which, both to the\nSubject and the onlookers, there may appear an element of marvel.\nEmotional occasions, especially violent ones, are extremely potent in\nprecipitating mental rearrangements. The sudden and explosive ways in\nwhich love, jealousy, guilt, fear, remorse, or anger can seize upon one\nare known to everybody.(100) Hope, happiness, security, resolve, emotions\ncharacteristic of conversion, can be equally explosive. And emotions that\ncome in this explosive way seldom leave things as they found them.\nIn his recent work on the Psychology of Religion, Professor Starbuck of\nCalifornia has shown by a statistical inquiry how closely parallel in its\nmanifestations the ordinary \u201cconversion\u201d which occurs in young people\nbrought up in evangelical circles is to that growth into a larger\nspiritual life which is a normal phase of adolescence in every class of\nhuman beings. The age is the same, falling usually between fourteen and\nseventeen. The symptoms are the same,\u2014sense of incompleteness and\nimperfection; brooding, depression, morbid introspection, and sense of\nsin; anxiety about the hereafter; distress over doubts, and the like. And\nthe result is the same,\u2014a happy relief and objectivity, as the confidence\nin self gets greater through the adjustment of the faculties to the wider\noutlook. In spontaneous religious awakening, apart from revivalistic\nexamples, and in the ordinary storm and stress and moulting\u2010time of\nadolescence, we also may meet with mystical experiences, astonishing the\nsubjects by their suddenness, just as in revivalistic conversion. The\nanalogy, in fact, is complete; and Starbuck\u2019s conclusion as to these\nordinary youthful conversions would seem to be the only sound one:\nConversion is in its essence a normal adolescent phenomenon, incidental to\nthe passage from the child\u2019s small universe to the wider intellectual and\nspiritual life of maturity.\n\u201cTheology,\u201d says Dr. Starbuck, \u201ctakes the adolescent tendencies and builds\nupon them; it sees that the essential thing in adolescent growth is\nbringing the person out of childhood into the new life of maturity and\npersonal insight. It accordingly brings those means to bear which will\nintensify the normal tendencies. It shortens up the period of duration of\nstorm and stress.\u201d The conversion phenomena of \u201cconviction of sin\u201d last,\nby this investigator\u2019s statistics, about one fifth as long as the periods\nof adolescent storm and stress phenomena of which he also got statistics,\nbut they are very much more intense. Bodily accompaniments, loss of sleep\nand appetite, for example, are much more frequent in them. \u201cThe essential\ndistinction appears to be that conversion intensifies but shortens the\nperiod by bringing the person to a definite crisis.\u201d(101)\nThe conversions which Dr. Starbuck here has in mind are of course mainly\nthose of very commonplace persons, kept true to a pre\u2010appointed type by\ninstruction, appeal, and example. The particular form which they affect is\nthe result of suggestion and imitation.(102) If they went through their\ngrowth\u2010crisis in other faiths and other countries, although the essence of\nthe change would be the same (since it is one in the main so inevitable),\nits accidents would be different. In Catholic lands, for example, and in\nour own Episcopalian sects, no such anxiety and conviction of sin is usual\nas in sects that encourage revivals. The sacraments being more relied on\nin these more strictly ecclesiastical bodies, the individual\u2019s personal\nacceptance of salvation needs less to be accentuated and led up to.\nBut every imitative phenomenon must once have had its original, and I\npropose that for the future we keep as close as may be to the more first\u2010\nhand and original forms of experience. These are more likely to be found\nin sporadic adult cases.\nProfessor Leuba, in a valuable article on the psychology of\nconversion,(103) subordinates the theological aspect of the religious life\nalmost entirely to its moral aspect. The religious sense he defines as\n\u201cthe feeling of un\u2010wholeness, of moral imperfection, of sin, to use the\ntechnical word, accompanied by the yearning after the peace of unity.\u201d\n\u201cThe word \u2018religion,\u2019 \u201d he says, \u201cis getting more and more to signify the\nconglomerate of desires and emotions springing from the sense of sin and\nits release\u201d; and he gives a large number of examples, in which the sin\nranges from drunkenness to spiritual pride, to show that the sense of it\nmay beset one and crave relief as urgently as does the anguish of the\nsickened flesh or any form of physical misery.\nUndoubtedly this conception covers an immense number of cases. A good one\nto use as an example is that of Mr. S. H. Hadley, who after his conversion\nbecame an active and useful rescuer of drunkards in New York. His\nexperience runs as follows:\u2014\n\u201cOne Tuesday evening I sat in a saloon in Harlem, a homeless,\nfriendless, dying drunkard. I had pawned or sold everything that\nwould bring a drink. I could not sleep unless I was dead drunk. I\nhad not eaten for days, and for four nights preceding I had\nsuffered with delirium tremens, or the horrors, from midnight till\nmorning. I had often said, \u2018I will never be a tramp. I will never\nbe cornered, for when that time comes, if ever it comes, I will\nfind a home in the bottom of the river.\u2019 But the Lord so ordered\nit that when that time did come I was not able to walk one quarter\nof the way to the river. As I sat there thinking, I seemed to feel\nsome great and mighty presence. I did not know then what it was. I\ndid learn afterwards that it was Jesus, the sinner\u2019s friend. I\nwalked up to the bar and pounded it with my fist till I made the\nglasses rattle. Those who stood by drinking looked on with\nscornful curiosity. I said I would never take another drink, if I\ndied on the street, and really I felt as though that would happen\nbefore morning. Something said, \u2018If you want to keep this promise,\ngo and have yourself locked up.\u2019 I went to the nearest station\u2010\nhouse and had myself locked up.\n\u201cI was placed in a narrow cell, and it seemed as though all the\ndemons that could find room came in that place with me. This was\nnot all the company I had, either. No, praise the Lord; that dear\nSpirit that came to me in the saloon was present, and said, Pray.\nI did pray, and though I did not feel any great help, I kept on\npraying. As soon as I was able to leave my cell I was taken to the\npolice court and remanded back to the cell. I was finally\nreleased, and found my way to my brother\u2019s house, where every care\nwas given me. While lying in bed the admonishing Spirit never left\nme, and when I arose the following Sabbath morning I felt that day\nwould decide my fate, and toward evening it came into my head to\ngo to Jerry M\u2019Auley\u2019s Mission. I went. The house was packed, and\nwith great difficulty I made my way to the space near the\nplatform. There I saw the apostle to the drunkard and the\noutcast\u2014that man of God, Jerry M\u2019Auley. He rose, and amid deep\nsilence told his experience. There was a sincerity about this man\nthat carried conviction with it, and I found myself saying, \u2018I\nwonder if God can save _me_?\u2019 I listened to the testimony of\ntwenty\u2010five or thirty persons, every one of whom had been saved\nfrom rum, and I made up my mind that I would be saved or die right\nthere. When the invitation was given, I knelt down with a crowd of\ndrunkards. Jerry made the first prayer. Then Mrs. M\u2019Auley prayed\nfervently for us. Oh, what a conflict was going on for my poor\nsoul! A blessed whisper said, \u2018Come\u2019; the devil said, \u2018Be\ncareful.\u2019 I halted but a moment, and then, with a breaking heart,\nI said, \u2018Dear Jesus, can you help me?\u2019 Never with mortal tongue\ncan I describe that moment. Although up to that moment my soul had\nbeen filled with indescribable gloom, I felt the glorious\nbrightness of the noonday sun shine into my heart. I felt I was a\nfree man. Oh, the precious feeling of safety, of freedom, of\nresting on Jesus! I felt that Christ with all his brightness and\npower had come into my life; that, indeed, old things had passed\naway and all things had become new.\n\u201cFrom that moment till now I have never wanted a drink of whiskey,\nand I have never seen money enough to make me take one. I promised\nGod that night that if he would take away the appetite for strong\ndrink, I would work for him all my life. He has done his part, and\nI have been trying to do mine.\u201d(104)\nDr. Leuba rightly remarks that there is little doctrinal theology in such\nan experience, which starts with the absolute need of a higher helper, and\nends with the sense that he has helped us. He gives other cases of\ndrunkards\u2019 conversions which are purely ethical, containing, as recorded,\nno theological beliefs whatever. John B. Gough\u2019s case, for instance, is\npractically, says Dr. Leuba, the conversion of an atheist\u2014neither God nor\nJesus being mentioned.(105) But in spite of the importance of this type of\nregeneration, with little or no intellectual readjustment, this writer\nsurely makes it too exclusive. It corresponds to the subjectively centred\nform of morbid melancholy, of which Bunyan and Alline were examples. But\nwe saw in our seventh lecture that there are objective forms of melancholy\nalso, in which the lack of rational meaning of the universe, and of life\nanyhow, is the burden that weighs upon one\u2014you remember Tolstoy\u2019s\ncase.(106) So there are distinct elements in conversion, and their\nrelations to individual lives deserve to be discriminated.(107)\nSome persons, for instance, never are, and possibly never under any\ncircumstances could be, converted. Religious ideas cannot become the\ncentre of their spiritual energy. They may be excellent persons, servants\nof God in practical ways, but they are not children of his kingdom. They\nare either incapable of imagining the invisible; or else, in the language\nof devotion, they are life\u2010long subjects of \u201cbarrenness\u201d and \u201cdryness.\u201d\nSuch inaptitude for religious faith may in some cases be intellectual in\nits origin. Their religious faculties may be checked in their natural\ntendency to expand, by beliefs about the world that are inhibitive, the\npessimistic and materialistic beliefs, for example, within which so many\ngood souls, who in former times would have freely indulged their religious\npropensities, find themselves nowadays, as it were, frozen; or the\nagnostic vetoes upon faith as something weak and shameful, under which so\nmany of us to\u2010day lie cowering, afraid to use our instincts. In many\npersons such inhibitions are never overcome. To the end of their days they\nrefuse to believe, their personal energy never gets to its religious\ncentre, and the latter remains inactive in perpetuity.\nIn other persons the trouble is profounder. There are men an\u00e6sthetic on\nthe religious side, deficient in that category of sensibility. Just as a\nbloodless organism can never, in spite of all its goodwill, attain to the\nreckless \u201canimal spirits\u201d enjoyed by those of sanguine temperament; so the\nnature which is spiritually barren may admire and envy faith in others,\nbut can never compass the enthusiasm and peace which those who are\ntemperamentally qualified for faith enjoy. All this may, however, turn out\neventually to have been a matter of temporary inhibition. Even late in\nlife some thaw, some release may take place, some bolt be shot back in the\nbarrenest breast, and the man\u2019s hard heart may soften and break into\nreligious feeling. Such cases more than any others suggest the idea that\nsudden conversion is by miracle. So long as they exist, we must not\nimagine ourselves to deal with irretrievably fixed classes.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nNow there are two forms of mental occurrence in human beings, which lead\nto a striking difference in the conversion process, a difference to which\nProfessor Starbuck has called attention. You know how it is when you try\nto recollect a forgotten name. Usually you help the recall by working for\nit, by mentally running over the places, persons, and things with which\nthe word was connected. But sometimes this effort fails: you feel then as\nif the harder you tried the less hope there would be, as though the name\nwere _jammed_, and pressure in its direction only kept it all the more\nfrom rising. And then the opposite expedient often succeeds. Give up the\neffort entirely; think of something altogether different, and in half an\nhour the lost name comes sauntering into your mind, as Emerson says, as\ncarelessly as if it had never been invited. Some hidden process was\nstarted in you by the effort, which went on after the effort ceased, and\nmade the result come as if it came spontaneously. A certain music teacher,\nsays Dr. Starbuck, says to her pupils after the thing to be done has been\nclearly pointed out, and unsuccessfully attempted: \u201cStop trying and it\nwill do itself!\u201d(108)\nThere is thus a conscious and voluntary way and an involuntary and\nunconscious way in which mental results may get accomplished; and we find\nboth ways exemplified in the history of conversion, giving us two types,\nwhich Starbuck calls the _volitional type_ and the _type by self\u2010\nsurrender_ respectively.\nIn the volitional type the regenerative change is usually gradual, and\nconsists in the building up, piece by piece, of a new set of moral and\nspiritual habits. But there are always critical points here at which the\nmovement forward seems much more rapid. This psychological fact is\nabundantly illustrated by Dr. Starbuck. Our education in any practical\naccomplishment proceeds apparently by jerks and starts, just as the growth\nof our physical bodies does.\n\u201cAn athlete ... sometimes awakens suddenly to an understanding of\nthe fine points of the game and to a real enjoyment of it, just as\nthe convert awakens to an appreciation of religion. If he keeps on\nengaging in the sport, there may come a day when all at once the\ngame plays itself through him\u2014when he loses himself in some great\ncontest. In the same way, a musician may suddenly reach a point at\nwhich pleasure in the technique of the art entirely falls away,\nand in some moment of inspiration he becomes the instrument\nthrough which music flows. The writer has chanced to hear two\ndifferent married persons, both of whose wedded lives had been\nbeautiful from the beginning, relate that not until a year or more\nafter marriage did they awake to the full blessedness of married\nlife. So it is with the religious experience of these persons we\nare studying.\u201d(109)\nWe shall erelong hear still more remarkable illustrations of\nsubconsciously maturing processes eventuating in results of which we\nsuddenly grow conscious. Sir William Hamilton and Professor Laycock of\nEdinburgh were among the first to call attention to this class of effects;\nbut Dr. Carpenter first, unless I am mistaken, introduced the term\n\u201cunconscious cerebration,\u201d which has since then been a popular phrase of\nexplanation. The facts are now known to us far more extensively than he\ncould know them, and the adjective \u201cunconscious,\u201d being for many of them\nalmost certainly a misnomer, is better replaced by the vaguer term\n\u201csubconscious\u201d or \u201csubliminal.\u201d\nOf the volitional type of conversion it would be easy to give\nexamples,(110) but they are as a rule less interesting than those of the\nself\u2010surrender type, in which the subconscious effects are more abundant\nand often startling. I will therefore hurry to the latter, the more so\nbecause the difference between the two types is after all not radical.\nEven in the most voluntarily built\u2010up sort of regeneration there are\npassages of partial self\u2010surrender interposed; and in the great majority\nof all cases, when the will has done its uttermost towards bringing one\nclose to the complete unification aspired after, it seems that the very\nlast step must be left to other forces and performed without the help of\nits activity. In other words, self\u2010surrender becomes then indispensable.\n\u201cThe personal will,\u201d says Dr. Starbuck, \u201cmust be given up. In many cases\nrelief persistently refuses to come until the person ceases to resist, or\nto make an effort in the direction he desires to go.\u201d\n\u201cI had said I would not give up; but when my will was broken, it\nwas all over,\u201d writes one of Starbuck\u2019s correspondents.\u2014Another\nsays: \u201cI simply said: \u2018Lord, I have done all I can; I leave the\nwhole matter with Thee;\u2019 and immediately there came to me a great\npeace.\u201d\u2014Another: \u201cAll at once it occurred to me that I might be\nsaved, too, if I would stop trying to do it all myself, and follow\nJesus: somehow I lost my load.\u201d\u2014Another: \u201cI finally ceased to\nresist, and gave myself up, though it was a hard struggle.\nGradually the feeling came over me that I had done my part, and\nGod was willing to do his.\u201d(111)\u2014\u201cLord, Thy will be done; damn or\nsave!\u201d cries John Nelson,(112) exhausted with the anxious struggle\nto escape damnation; and at that moment his soul was filled with\npeace.\nDr. Starbuck gives an interesting, and it seems to me a true, account\u2014so\nfar as conceptions so schematic can claim truth at all\u2014of the reasons why\nself\u2010surrender at the last moment should be so indispensable. To begin\nwith, there are two things in the mind of the candidate for conversion:\nfirst, the present incompleteness or wrongness, the \u201csin\u201d which he is\neager to escape from; and, second, the positive ideal which he longs to\ncompass. Now with most of us the sense of our present wrongness is a far\nmore distinct piece of our consciousness than is the imagination of any\npositive ideal we can aim at. In a majority of cases, indeed, the \u201csin\u201d\nalmost exclusively engrosses the attention, so that conversion is \u201c_a\nprocess of struggling away from sin rather than of striving towards\nrighteousness_.\u201d(113) A man\u2019s conscious wit and will, so far as they\nstrain towards the ideal, are aiming at something only dimly and\ninaccurately imagined. Yet all the while the forces of mere organic\nripening within him are going on towards their own prefigured result, and\nhis conscious strainings are letting loose subconscious allies behind the\nscenes, which in their way work towards rearrangement; and the\nrearrangement towards which all these deeper forces tend is pretty surely\ndefinite, and definitely different from what he consciously conceives and\ndetermines. It may consequently be actually interfered with (_jammed_, as\nit were, like the lost word when we seek too energetically to recall it),\nby his voluntary efforts slanting from the true direction.\nStarbuck seems to put his finger on the root of the matter when he says\nthat to exercise the personal will is still to live in the region where\nthe imperfect self is the thing most emphasized. Where, on the contrary,\nthe subconscious forces take the lead, it is more probably the better self\n_in posse_ which directs the operation. Instead of being clumsily and\nvaguely aimed at from without, it is then itself the organizing centre.\nWhat then must the person do? \u201cHe must relax,\u201d says Dr. Starbuck,\u2014\u201cthat\nis, he must fall back on the larger Power that makes for righteousness,\nwhich has been welling up in his own being, and let it finish in its own\nway the work it has begun.... The act of yielding, in this point of view,\nis giving one\u2019s self over to the new life, making it the centre of a new\npersonality, and living, from within, the truth of it which had before\nbeen viewed objectively.\u201d(114)\n\u201cMan\u2019s extremity is God\u2019s opportunity\u201d is the theological way of putting\nthis fact of the need of self\u2010surrender; whilst the physiological way of\nstating it would be, \u201cLet one do all in one\u2019s power, and one\u2019s nervous\nsystem will do the rest.\u201d Both statements acknowledge the same fact.(115)\nTo state it in terms of our own symbolism: When the new centre of personal\nenergy has been subconsciously incubated so long as to be just ready to\nopen into flower, \u201chands off\u201d is the only word for us, it must burst forth\nunaided!\nWe have used the vague and abstract language of psychology. But since, in\nany terms, the crisis described is the throwing of our conscious selves\nupon the mercy of powers which, whatever they may be, are more ideal than\nwe are actually, and make for our redemption, you see why self\u2010surrender\nhas been and always must be regarded as the vital turning\u2010point of the\nreligious life, so far as the religious life is spiritual and no affair of\nouter works and ritual and sacraments. One may say that the whole\ndevelopment of Christianity in inwardness has consisted in little more\nthan the greater and greater emphasis attached to this crisis of self\u2010\nsurrender. From Catholicism to Lutheranism, and then to Calvinism; from\nthat to Wesleyanism; and from this, outside of technical Christianity\naltogether, to pure \u201cliberalism\u201d or transcendental idealism, whether or\nnot of the mind\u2010cure type, taking in the medi\u00e6val mystics, the quietists,\nthe pietists, and quakers by the way, we can trace the stages of progress\ntowards the idea of an immediate spiritual help, experienced by the\nindividual in his forlornness and standing in no essential need of\ndoctrinal apparatus or propitiatory machinery.\nPsychology and religion are thus in perfect harmony up to this point,\nsince both admit that there are forces seemingly outside of the conscious\nindividual that bring redemption to his life. Nevertheless psychology,\ndefining these forces as \u201csubconscious,\u201d and speaking of their effects as\ndue to \u201cincubation,\u201d or \u201ccerebration,\u201d implies that they do not transcend\nthe individual\u2019s personality; and herein she diverges from Christian\ntheology, which insists that they are direct supernatural operations of\nthe Deity. I propose to you that we do not yet consider this divergence\nfinal, but leave the question for a while in abeyance\u2014continued inquiry\nmay enable us to get rid of some of the apparent discord.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nRevert, then, for a moment more to the psychology of self\u2010surrender.\nWhen you find a man living on the ragged edge of his consciousness, pent\nin to his sin and want and incompleteness, and consequently inconsolable,\nand then simply tell him that all is well with him, that he must stop his\nworry, break with his discontent, and give up his anxiety, you seem to him\nto come with pure absurdities. The only positive consciousness he has\ntells him that all is _not_ well, and the better way you offer sounds\nsimply as if you proposed to him to assert cold\u2010blooded falsehoods. \u201cThe\nwill to believe\u201d cannot be stretched as far as that. We can make ourselves\nmore faithful to a belief of which we have the rudiments, but we cannot\ncreate a belief out of whole cloth when our perception actively assures us\nof its opposite. The better mind proposed to us comes in that case in the\nform of a pure negation of the only mind we have, and we cannot actively\nwill a pure negation.\nThere are only two ways in which it is possible to get rid of anger,\nworry, fear, despair, or other undesirable affections. One is that an\nopposite affection should overpoweringly break over us, and the other is\nby getting so exhausted with the struggle that we have to stop,\u2014so we drop\ndown, give up, and _don\u2019t care_ any longer. Our emotional brain\u2010centres\nstrike work, and we lapse into a temporary apathy. Now there is\ndocumentary proof that this state of temporary exhaustion not infrequently\nforms part of the conversion crisis. So long as the egoistic worry of the\nsick soul guards the door, the expansive confidence of the soul of faith\ngains no presence. But let the former faint away, even but for a moment,\nand the latter can profit by the opportunity, and, having once acquired\npossession, may retain it. Carlyle\u2019s Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh passes from the\neverlasting No to the everlasting Yes through a \u201cCentre of Indifference.\u201d\nLet me give you a good illustration of this feature in the conversion\nprocess. That genuine saint, David Brainerd, describes his own crisis in\nthe following words:\u2014\n\u201cOne morning, while I was walking in a solitary place as usual, I\nat once saw that all my contrivances and projects to effect or\nprocure deliverance and salvation for myself were utterly in vain;\nI was brought quite to a stand, as finding myself totally lost. I\nsaw that it was forever impossible for me to do anything towards\nhelping or delivering myself, that I had made all the pleas I ever\ncould have made to all eternity; and that all my pleas were vain,\nfor I saw that self\u2010interest had led me to pray, and that I had\nnever once prayed from any respect to the glory of God. I saw that\nthere was no necessary connection between my prayers and the\nbestowment of divine mercy; that they laid not the least\nobligation upon God to bestow his grace upon me; and that there\nwas no more virtue or goodness in them than there would be in my\npaddling with my hand in the water. I saw that I had been heaping\nup my devotions before God, fasting, praying, etc., pretending,\nand indeed really thinking sometimes that I was aiming at the\nglory of God; whereas I never once truly intended it, but only my\nown happiness. I saw that as I had never done anything for God, I\nhad no claim on anything from him but perdition, on account of my\nhypocrisy and mockery. When I saw evidently that I had regard to\nnothing but self\u2010interest, then my duties appeared a vile mockery\nand a continual course of lies, for the whole was nothing but\nself\u2010worship, and an horrid abuse of God.\n\u201cI continued, as I remember, in this state of mind, from Friday\nmorning till the Sabbath evening following (July 12, 1739), when I\nwas walking again in the same solitary place. Here, in a mournful\nmelancholy state _I was attempting to pray; but found no heart to\nengage in that or any other duty; my former concern, exercise, and\nreligious affections were now gone. I thought that the Spirit of\nGod had quite left me; but still was not distressed; yet\ndisconsolate, as if there was nothing in heaven or earth could\nmake me happy. Having been thus endeavoring to pray\u2014though, as I\nthought, very stupid and senseless_\u2014for near half an hour; then,\nas I was walking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory seemed to\nopen to the apprehension of my soul. I do not mean any external\nbrightness, nor any imagination of a body of light, but it was a\nnew inward apprehension or view that I had of God, such as I never\nhad before, nor anything which had the least resemblance to it. I\nhad no particular apprehension of any one person in the Trinity,\neither the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost; but it appeared to\nbe Divine glory. My soul rejoiced with joy unspeakable, to see\nsuch a God, such a glorious Divine Being; and I was inwardly\npleased and satisfied that he should be God over all for ever and\never. My soul was so captivated and delighted with the excellency\nof God that I was even swallowed up in him; at least to that\ndegree that I had no thought about my own salvation, and scarce\nreflected that there was such a creature as myself. I continued in\nthis state of inward joy, peace, and astonishing, till near dark\nwithout any sensible abatement; and then began to think and\nexamine what I had seen; and felt sweetly composed in my mind all\nthe evening following. I felt myself in a new world, and\neverything about me appeared with a different aspect from what it\nwas wont to do. At this time, the way of salvation opened to me\nwith such infinite wisdom, suitableness, and excellency, that I\nwondered I should ever think of any other way of salvation; was\namazed that I had not dropped my own contrivances, and complied\nwith this lovely, blessed, and excellent way before. If I could\nhave been saved by my own duties or any other way that I had\nformerly contrived, my whole soul would now have refused it. I\nwondered that all the world did not see and comply with this way\nof salvation, entirely by the righteousness of Christ.\u201d(116)\nI have italicized the passage which records the exhaustion of the anxious\nemotion hitherto habitual. In a large proportion, perhaps the majority, of\nreports, the writers speak as if the exhaustion of the lower and the\nentrance of the higher emotion were simultaneous,(117) yet often again\nthey speak as if the higher actively drove the lower out. This is\nundoubtedly true in a great many instances, as we shall presently see. But\noften there seems little doubt that both conditions\u2014subconscious ripening\nof the one affection and exhaustion of the other\u2014must simultaneously have\nconspired, in order to produce the result.\nT. W. B., a convert of Nettleton\u2019s, being brought to an acute\nparoxysm of conviction of sin, ate nothing all day, locked himself\nin his room in the evening in complete despair, crying aloud, \u201cHow\nlong, O Lord, how long?\u201d \u201cAfter repeating this and similar\nlanguage,\u201d he says, \u201cseveral times, _I seemed to sink away into a\nstate of insensibility_. When I came to myself again I was on my\nknees, praying not for myself but for others. I felt submission to\nthe will of God, willing that he should do with me as should seem\ngood in his sight. My concern seemed all lost in concern for\nothers.\u201d(118)\nOur great American revivalist Finney writes: \u201cI said to myself:\n\u2018What is this? I must have grieved the Holy Ghost entirely away. I\nhave lost all my conviction. I have not a particle of concern\nabout my soul; and it must be that the Spirit has left me.\u2019 \u2018Why!\u2019\nthought I, \u2018I never was so far from being concerned about my own\nsalvation in my life.\u2019... I tried to recall my convictions, to get\nback again the load of sin under which I had been laboring. I\ntried in vain to make myself anxious. I was so quiet and peaceful\nthat I tried to feel concerned about that, lest it should be the\nresult of my having grieved the Spirit away.\u201d(119)\nBut beyond all question there are persons in whom, quite independently of\nany exhaustion in the Subject\u2019s capacity for feeling, or even in the\nabsence of any acute previous feeling, the higher condition, having\nreached the due degree of energy, bursts through all barriers and sweeps\nin like a sudden flood. These are the most striking and memorable cases,\nthe cases of instantaneous conversion to which the conception of divine\ngrace has been most peculiarly attached. I have given one of them at\nlength\u2014the case of Mr. Bradley. But I had better reserve the other cases\nand my comments on the rest of the subject for the following lecture.\nLECTURE X. CONVERSION\u2014CONCLUDED.\nIn this lecture we have to finish the subject of Conversion, considering\nat first those striking instantaneous instances of which Saint Paul\u2019s is\nthe most eminent, and in which, often amid tremendous emotional excitement\nor perturbation of the senses, a complete division is established in the\ntwinkling of an eye between the old life and the new. Conversion of this\ntype is an important phase of religious experience, owing to the part\nwhich it has played in Protestant theology, and it behooves us to study it\nconscientiously on that account.\nI think I had better cite two or three of these cases before proceeding to\na more generalized account. One must know concrete instances first; for,\nas Professor Agassiz used to say, one can see no farther into a\ngeneralization than just so far as one\u2019s previous acquaintance with\nparticulars enables one to take it in. I will go back, then, to the case\nof our friend Henry Alline, and quote his report of the 26th of March,\n1775, on which his poor divided mind became unified for good.\n\u201cAs I was about sunset wandering in the fields lamenting my\nmiserable lost and undone condition, and almost ready to sink\nunder my burden, I thought I was in such a miserable case as never\nany man was before. I returned to the house, and when I got to the\ndoor, just as I was stepping off the threshold, the following\nimpressions came into my mind like a powerful but small still\nvoice. You have been seeking, praying, reforming, laboring,\nreading, hearing, and meditating, and what have you done by it\ntowards your salvation? Are you any nearer to conversion now than\nwhen you first began? Are you any more prepared for heaven, or\nfitter to appear before the impartial bar of God, than when you\nfirst began to seek?\n\u201cIt brought such conviction on me that I was obliged to say that I\ndid not think I was one step nearer than at first, but as much\ncondemned, as much exposed, and as miserable as before. I cried\nout within myself, O Lord God, I am lost, and if thou, O Lord,\ndost not find out some new way, I know nothing of, I shall never\nbe saved, for the ways and methods I have prescribed to myself\nhave all failed me, and I am willing they should fail. O Lord,\nhave mercy! O Lord, have mercy!\n\u201cThese discoveries continued until I went into the house and sat\ndown. After I sat down, being all in confusion, like a drowning\nman that was just giving up to sink, and almost in an agony, I\nturned very suddenly round in my chair, and seeing part of an old\nBible lying in one of the chairs, I caught hold of it in great\nhaste; and opening it without any premeditation, cast my eyes on\nthe 38th Psalm, which was the first time I ever saw the word of\nGod: it took hold of me with such power that it seemed to go\nthrough my whole soul, so that it seemed as if God was praying in,\nwith, and for me. About this time my father called the family to\nattend prayers; I attended, but paid no regard to what he said in\nhis prayer, but continued praying in those words of the Psalm. Oh,\nhelp me, help me! cried I, thou Redeemer of souls, and save me, or\nI am gone forever; thou canst this night, if thou pleasest, with\none drop of thy blood atone for my sins, and appease the wrath of\nan angry God. At that instant of time when I gave all up to him to\ndo with me as he pleased, and was willing that God should rule\nover me at his pleasure, redeeming love broke into my soul with\nrepeated scriptures, with such power that my whole soul seemed to\nbe melted down with love; the burden of guilt and condemnation was\ngone, darkness was expelled, my heart humbled and filled with\ngratitude, and my whole soul, that was a few minutes ago groaning\nunder mountains of death, and crying to an unknown God for help,\nwas now filled with immortal love, soaring on the wings of faith,\nfreed from the chains of death and darkness, and crying out, My\nLord and my God; thou art my rock and my fortress, my shield and\nmy high tower, my life, my joy, my present and my everlasting\nportion. Looking up, I thought I saw that same light [he had on\nmore than one previous occasion seen subjectively a bright blaze\nof light], though it appeared different; and as soon as I saw it,\nthe design was opened to me, according to his promise, and I was\nobliged to cry out: Enough, enough, O blessed God! The work of\nconversion, the change, and the manifestations of it are no more\ndisputable than that light which I see, or anything that ever I\nsaw.\n\u201cIn the midst of all my joys, in less than half an hour after my\nsoul was set at liberty, the Lord discovered to me my labor in the\nministry and call to preach the gospel. I cried out, Amen, Lord,\nI\u2019ll go; send me, send me. I spent the greatest part of the night\nin ecstasies of joy, praising and adoring the Ancient of Days for\nhis free and unbounded grace. After I had been so long in this\ntransport and heavenly frame that my nature seemed to require\nsleep, I thought to close my eyes for a few moments; then the\ndevil stepped in, and told me that if I went to sleep, I should\nlose it all, and when I should awake in the morning I would find\nit to be nothing but a fancy and delusion. I immediately cried\nout, O Lord God, if I am deceived, undeceive me.\n\u201cI then closed my eyes for a few minutes, and seemed to be\nrefreshed with sleep; and when I awoke, the first inquiry was,\nWhere is my God? And in an instant of time, my soul seemed awake\nin and with God, and surrounded by the arms of everlasting love.\nAbout sunrise I arose with joy to relate to my parents what God\nhad done for my soul, and declared to them the miracle of God\u2019s\nunbounded grace. I took a Bible to show them the words that were\nimpressed by God on my soul the evening before; but when I came to\nopen the Bible, it appeared all new to me.\n\u201cI so longed to be useful in the cause of Christ, in preaching the\ngospel, that it seemed as if I could not rest any longer, but go I\nmust and tell the wonders of redeeming love. I lost all taste for\ncarnal pleasures, and carnal company, and was enabled to forsake\nthem.\u201d(120)\nYoung Mr. Alline, after the briefest of delays, and with no book\u2010learning\nbut his Bible, and no teaching save that of his own experience, became a\nChristian minister, and thenceforward his life was fit to rank, for its\nausterity and single\u2010mindedness, with that of the most devoted saints. But\nhappy as he became in his strenuous way, he never got his taste for even\nthe most innocent carnal pleasures back. We must class him, like Bunyan\nand Tolstoy, amongst those upon whose soul the iron of melancholy left a\npermanent imprint. His redemption was into another universe than this mere\nnatural world, and life remained for him a sad and patient trial. Years\nlater we can find him making such an entry as this in his diary: \u201cOn\nWednesday the 12th I preached at a wedding, and had the happiness thereby\nto be the means of excluding carnal mirth.\u201d\nThe next case I will give is that of a correspondent of Professor Leuba,\nprinted in the latter\u2019s article, already cited, in vol. vi. of the\nAmerican Journal of Psychology. This subject was an Oxford graduate, the\nson of a clergyman, and the story resembles in many points the classic\ncase of Colonel Gardiner, which everybody may be supposed to know. Here it\nis, somewhat abridged:\u2014\n\u201cBetween the period of leaving Oxford and my conversion I never\ndarkened the door of my father\u2019s church, although I lived with him\nfor eight years, making what money I wanted by journalism, and\nspending it in high carousal with any one who would sit with me\nand drink it away. So I lived, sometimes drunk for a week\ntogether, and then a terrible repentance, and would not touch a\ndrop for a whole month.\n\u201cIn all this period, that is, up to thirty\u2010three years of age, I\nnever had a desire to reform on religious grounds. But all my\npangs were due to some terrible remorse I used to feel after a\nheavy carousal, the remorse taking the shape of regret after my\nfolly in wasting my life in such a way\u2014a man of superior talents\nand education. This terrible remorse turned me gray in one night,\nand whenever it came upon me I was perceptibly grayer the next\nmorning. What I suffered in this way is beyond the expression of\nwords. It was hell\u2010fire in all its most dreadful tortures. Often\ndid I vow that if I got over \u2018this time\u2019 I would reform. Alas, in\nabout three days I fully recovered, and was as happy as ever. So\nit went on for years, but, with a physique like a rhinoceros, I\nalways recovered, and as long as I let drink alone, no man was as\ncapable of enjoying life as I was.\n\u201cI was converted in my own bedroom in my father\u2019s rectory house at\nprecisely three o\u2019clock in the afternoon of a hot July day (July\n13, 1886). I was in perfect health, having been off from the drink\nfor nearly a month. I was in no way troubled about my soul. In\nfact, God was not in my thoughts that day. A young lady friend\nsent me a copy of Professor Drummond\u2019s Natural Law in the\nSpiritual World, asking me my opinion of it as a literary work\nonly. Being proud of my critical talents and wishing to enhance\nmyself in my new friend\u2019s esteem, I took the book to my bedroom\nfor quiet, intending to give it a thorough study, and then write\nher what I thought of it. It was here that God met me face to\nface, and I shall never forget the meeting. \u2018He that hath the Son\nhath life eternal, he that hath not the Son hath not life.\u2019 I had\nread this scores of times before, but this made all the\ndifference. I was now in God\u2019s presence and my attention was\nabsolutely \u2018soldered\u2019 on to this verse, and I was not allowed to\nproceed with the book till I had fairly considered what these\nwords really involved. Only then was I allowed to proceed, feeling\nall the while that there was another being in my bedroom, though\nnot seen by me. The stillness was very marvelous, and I felt\nsupremely happy. It was most unquestionably shown me, in one\nsecond of time, that I had never touched the Eternal: and that if\nI died then, I must inevitably be lost. I was undone. I knew it as\nwell as I now know I am saved. The Spirit of God showed it me in\nineffable love; there was no terror in it; I felt God\u2019s love so\npowerfully upon me that only a mighty sorrow crept over me that I\nhad lost all through my own folly; and what was I to do? What\ncould I do? I did not repent even; God never asked me to repent.\nAll I felt was \u2018I am undone,\u2019 and God cannot help it, although he\nloves me. No fault on the part of the Almighty. All the time I was\nsupremely happy: I felt like a little child before his father. I\nhad done wrong, but my Father did not scold me, but loved me most\nwondrously. Still my doom was sealed. I was lost to a certainty,\nand being naturally of a brave disposition I did not quail under\nit, but deep sorrow for the past, mixed with regret for what I had\nlost, took hold upon me, and my soul thrilled within me to think\nit was all over. Then there crept in upon me so gently, so\nlovingly, so unmistakably, a way of escape, and what was it after\nall? The old, old story over again, told in the simplest way:\n\u2018There is no name under heaven whereby ye can be saved except that\nof the Lord Jesus Christ.\u2019 No words were spoken to me; my soul\nseemed to see my Saviour in the spirit, and from that hour to\nthis, nearly nine years now, there has never been in my life one\ndoubt that the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father both worked\nupon me that afternoon in July, both differently, and both in the\nmost perfect love conceivable, and I rejoiced there and then in a\nconversion so astounding that the whole village heard of it in\nless than twenty\u2010four hours.\n\u201cBut a time of trouble was yet to come. The day after my\nconversion I went into the hay\u2010field to lend a hand with the\nharvest, and not having made any promise to God to abstain or\ndrink in moderation only, I took too much and came home drunk. My\npoor sister was heart\u2010broken; and I felt ashamed of myself and got\nto my bedroom at once, where she followed me, weeping copiously.\nShe said I had been converted and fallen away instantly. But\nalthough I was quite full of drink (not muddled, however), I knew\nthat God\u2019s work begun in me was not going to be wasted. About\nmidday I made on my knees the first prayer before God for twenty\nyears. I did not ask to be forgiven; I felt that was no good, for\nI would be sure to fall again. Well, what did I do? I committed\nmyself to him in the profoundest belief that my individuality was\ngoing to be destroyed, that he would take all from me, and I was\nwilling. In such a surrender lies the secret of a holy life. From\nthat hour drink has had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never\nwant it. The same thing occurred with my pipe: after being a\nregular smoker from my twelfth year the desire for it went at\nonce, and has never returned. So with every known sin, the\ndeliverance in each case being permanent and complete. I have had\nno temptation since conversion, God seemingly having shut out\nSatan from that course with me. He gets a free hand in other ways,\nbut never on sins of the flesh. Since I gave up to God all\nownership in my own life, he has guided me in a thousand ways, and\nhas opened my path in a way almost incredible to those who do not\nenjoy the blessing of a truly surrendered life.\u201d\nSo much for our graduate of Oxford, in whom you notice the complete\nabolition of an ancient appetite as one of the conversion\u2019s fruits.\nThe most curious record of sudden conversion with which I am acquainted is\nthat of M. Alphonse Ratisbonne, a freethinking French Jew, to Catholicism,\nat Rome in 1842. In a letter to a clerical friend, written a few months\nlater, the convert gives a palpitating account of the circumstances.(121)\nThe predisposing conditions appear to have been slight. He had an elder\nbrother who had been converted and was a Catholic priest. He was himself\nirreligious, and nourished an antipathy to the apostate brother and\ngenerally to his \u201ccloth.\u201d Finding himself at Rome in his twenty\u2010ninth\nyear, he fell in with a French gentleman who tried to make a proselyte of\nhim, but who succeeded no farther after two or three conversations than to\nget him to hang (half jocosely) a religious medal round his neck, and to\naccept and read a copy of a short prayer to the Virgin. M. Ratisbonne\nrepresents his own part in the conversations as having been of a light and\nchaffing order; but he notes the fact that for some days he was unable to\nbanish the words of the prayer from his mind, and that the night before\nthe crisis he had a sort of nightmare, in the imagery of which a black\ncross with no Christ upon it figured. Nevertheless, until noon of the next\nday he was free in mind and spent the time in trivial conversations. I now\ngive his own words.\n\u201cIf at this time any one had accosted me, saying: \u2018Alphonse, in a\nquarter of an hour you shall be adoring Jesus Christ as your God\nand Saviour; you shall lie prostrate with your face upon the\nground in a humble church; you shall be smiting your breast at the\nfoot of a priest; you shall pass the carnival in a college of\nJesuits to prepare yourself to receive baptism, ready to give your\nlife for the Catholic faith; you shall renounce the world and its\npomps and pleasures; renounce your fortune, your hopes, and if\nneed be, your betrothed; the affections of your family, the esteem\nof your friends, and your attachment to the Jewish people; you\nshall have no other aspiration than to follow Christ and bear his\ncross till death;\u2019\u2014if, I say, a prophet had come to me with such a\nprediction, I should have judged that only one person could be\nmore mad than he,\u2014whosoever, namely, might believe in the\npossibility of such senseless folly becoming true. And yet that\nfolly is at present my only wisdom, my sole happiness.\n\u201cComing out of the caf\u00e9 I met the carriage of Monsieur B. [the\nproselyting friend]. He stopped and invited me in for a drive, but\nfirst asked me to wait for a few minutes whilst he attended to\nsome duty at the church of San Andrea delle Fratte. Instead of\nwaiting in the carriage, I entered the church myself to look at\nit. The church of San Andrea was poor, small, and empty; I believe\nthat I found myself there almost alone. No work of art attracted\nmy attention; and I passed my eyes mechanically over its interior\nwithout being arrested by any particular thought. I can only\nremember an entirely black dog which went trotting and turning\nbefore me as I mused. In an instant the dog had disappeared, the\nwhole church had vanished, I no longer saw anything, ... or more\ntruly I saw, O my God, one thing alone.\n\u201cHeavens, how can I speak of it? Oh no! human words cannot attain\nto expressing the inexpressible. Any description, however sublime\nit might be, could be but a profanation of the unspeakable truth.\n\u201cI was there prostrate on the ground, bathed in my tears, with my\nheart beside itself, when M. B. called me back to life. I could\nnot reply to the questions which followed from him one upon the\nother. But finally I took the medal which I had on my breast, and\nwith all the effusion of my soul I kissed the image of the Virgin,\nradiant with grace, which it bore. Oh, indeed, it was She! It was\nindeed She! [What he had seen had been a vision of the Virgin.]\n\u201cI did not know where I was: I did not know whether I was Alphonse\nor another. I only felt myself changed and believed myself another\nme; I looked for myself in myself and did not find myself. In the\nbottom of my soul I felt an explosion of the most ardent joy; I\ncould not speak; I had no wish to reveal what had happened. But I\nfelt something solemn and sacred within me which made me ask for a\npriest. I was led to one; and there, alone, after he had given me\nthe positive order, I spoke as best I could, kneeling, and with my\nheart still trembling. I could give no account to myself of the\ntruth of which I had acquired a knowledge and a faith. All that I\ncan say is that in an instant the bandage had fallen from my eyes;\nand not one bandage only, but the whole manifold of bandages in\nwhich I had been brought up. One after another they rapidly\ndisappeared, even as the mud and ice disappear under the rays of\nthe burning sun.\n\u201cI came out as from a sepulchre, from an abyss of darkness; and I\nwas living, perfectly living. But I wept, for at the bottom of\nthat gulf I saw the extreme of misery from which I had been saved\nby an infinite mercy; and I shuddered at the sight of my\niniquities, stupefied, melted, overwhelmed with wonder and with\ngratitude. You may ask me how I came to this new insight, for\ntruly I had never opened a book of religion nor even read a single\npage of the Bible, and the dogma of original sin is either\nentirely denied or forgotten by the Hebrews of to\u2010day, so that I\nhad thought so little about it that I doubt whether I ever knew\nits name. But how came I, then, to this perception of it? I can\nanswer nothing save this, that on entering that church I was in\ndarkness altogether, and on coming out of it I saw the fullness of\nthe light. I can explain the change no better than by the simile\nof a profound sleep or the analogy of one born blind who should\nsuddenly open his eyes to the day. He sees, but cannot define the\nlight which bathes him and by means of which he sees the objects\nwhich excite his wonder. If we cannot explain physical light, how\ncan we explain the light which is the truth itself? And I think I\nremain within the limits of veracity when I say that without\nhaving any knowledge of the letter of religious doctrine, I now\nintuitively perceived its sense and spirit. Better than if I saw\nthem, I _felt_ those hidden things; I felt them by the\ninexplicable effects they produced in me. It all happened in my\ninterior mind; and those impressions, more rapid than thought,\nshook my soul, revolved and turned it, as it were, in another\ndirection, towards other aims, by other paths. I express myself\nbadly. But do you wish, Lord, that I should inclose in poor and\nbarren words sentiments which the heart alone can understand?\u201d\nI might multiply cases almost indefinitely, but these will suffice to show\nyou how real, definite, and memorable an event a sudden conversion may be\nto him who has the experience. Throughout the height of it he undoubtedly\nseems to himself a passive spectator or undergoer of an astounding process\nperformed upon him from above. There is too much evidence of this for any\ndoubt of it to be possible. Theology, combining this fact with the\ndoctrines of election and grace, has concluded that the spirit of God is\nwith us at these dramatic moments in a peculiarly miraculous way, unlike\nwhat happens at any other juncture of our lives. At that moment, it\nbelieves, an absolutely new nature is breathed into us, and we become\npartakers of the very substance of the Deity.\nThat the conversion should be instantaneous seems called for on this view,\nand the Moravian Protestants appear to have been the first to see this\nlogical consequence. The Methodists soon followed suit, practically if not\ndogmatically, and a short time ere his death, John Wesley wrote:\u2014\n\u201cIn London alone I found 652 members of our Society who were\nexceeding clear in their experience, and whose testimony I could\nsee no reason to doubt. And every one of these (without a single\nexception) has declared that his deliverance from sin was\ninstantaneous; that the change was wrought in a moment. Had half\nof these, or one third, or one in twenty, declared it was\n_gradually_ wrought in _them_, I should have believed this, with\nregard to _them_, and thought that _some_ were gradually\nsanctified and some instantaneously. But as I have not found, in\nso long a space of time, a single person speaking thus, I cannot\nbut believe that sanctification is commonly, if not always, an\ninstantaneous work.\u201d Tyerman\u2019s Life of Wesley, i. 463.\nAll this while the more usual sects of Protestantism have set no such\nstore by instantaneous conversion. For them as for the Catholic Church,\nChrist\u2019s blood, the sacraments, and the individual\u2019s ordinary religious\nduties are practically supposed to suffice to his salvation, even though\nno acute crisis of self\u2010despair and surrender followed by relief should be\nexperienced. For Methodism, on the contrary, unless there have been a\ncrisis of this sort, salvation is only offered, not effectively received,\nand Christ\u2019s sacrifice in so far forth is incomplete. Methodism surely\nhere follows, if not the healthier\u2010minded, yet on the whole the profounder\nspiritual instinct. The individual models which it has set up as typical\nand worthy of imitation are not only the more interesting dramatically,\nbut psychologically they have been the more complete.\nIn the fully evolved Revivalism of Great Britain and America we have, so\nto speak, the codified and stereotyped procedure to which this way of\nthinking has led. In spite of the unquestionable fact that saints of the\nonce\u2010born type exist, that there may be a gradual growth in holiness\nwithout a cataclysm; in spite of the obvious leakage (as one may say) of\nmuch mere natural goodness into the scheme of salvation; revivalism has\nalways assumed that only its own type of religious experience can be\nperfect; you must first be nailed on the cross of natural despair and\nagony, and then in the twinkling of an eye be miraculously released.\nIt is natural that those who personally have traversed such an experience\nshould carry away a feeling of its being a miracle rather than a natural\nprocess. Voices are often heard, lights seen, or visions witnessed;\nautomatic motor phenomena occur; and it always seems, after the surrender\nof the personal will, as if an extraneous higher power had flooded in and\ntaken possession. Moreover the sense of renovation, safety, cleanness,\nrightness, can be so marvelous and jubilant as well to warrant one\u2019s\nbelief in a radically new substantial nature.\n\u201cConversion,\u201d writes the New England Puritan, Joseph Alleine, \u201cis\nnot the putting in a patch of holiness; but with the true convert\nholiness is woven into all his powers, principles, and practice.\nThe sincere Christian is quite a new fabric, from the foundation\nto the top\u2010stone. He is a new man, a new creature.\u201d\nAnd Jonathan Edwards says in the same strain: \u201cThose gracious\ninfluences which are the effects of the Spirit of God are\naltogether supernatural\u2014are quite different from anything that\nunregenerate men experience. They are what no improvement, or\ncomposition of natural qualifications or principles will ever\nproduce; because they not only differ from what is natural, and\nfrom everything that natural men experience in degree and\ncircumstances, but also in kind, and are of a nature far more\nexcellent. From hence it follows that in gracious affections there\nare [also] new perceptions and sensations entirely different in\ntheir nature and kind from anything experienced by the [same]\nsaints before they were sanctified.... The conceptions which the\nsaints have of the loveliness of God, and that kind of delight\nwhich they experience in it, are quite peculiar, and entirely\ndifferent from anything which a natural man can possess, or of\nwhich he can form any proper notion.\u201d\nAnd that such a glorious transformation as this ought of necessity to be\npreceded by despair is shown by Edwards in another passage.\n\u201cSurely it cannot be unreasonable,\u201d he says, \u201cthat before God\ndelivers us from a state of sin and liability to everlasting woe,\nhe should give us some considerable sense of the evil from which\nhe delivers us, in order that we may know and feel the importance\nof salvation, and be enabled to appreciate the value of what God\nis pleased to do for us. As those who are saved are successively\nin two extremely different states\u2014first in a state of condemnation\nand then in a state of justification and blessedness\u2014and as God,\nin the salvation of men, deals with them as rational and\nintelligent creatures, it appears agreeable to this wisdom, that\nthose who are saved should be made sensible of their Being, in\nthose two different states. In the first place, that they should\nbe made sensible of their state of condemnation; and afterwards,\nof their state of deliverance and happiness.\u201d\nSuch quotations express sufficiently well for our purpose the doctrinal\ninterpretation of these changes. Whatever part suggestion and imitation\nmay have played in producing them in men and women in excited assemblies,\nthey have at any rate been in countless individual instances an original\nand unborrowed experience. Were we writing the story of the mind from the\npurely natural\u2010history point of view, with no religious interest whatever,\nwe should still have to write down man\u2019s liability to sudden and complete\nconversion as one of his most curious peculiarities.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWhat, now, must we ourselves think of this question? Is an instantaneous\nconversion a miracle in which God is present as he is present in no change\nof heart less strikingly abrupt? Are there two classes of human beings,\neven among the apparently regenerate, of which the one class really\npartakes of Christ\u2019s nature while the other merely seems to do so? Or, on\nthe contrary, may the whole phenomenon of regeneration, even in these\nstartling instantaneous examples, possibly be a strictly natural process,\ndivine in its fruits, of course, but in one case more and in another less\nso, and neither more nor less divine in its mere causation and mechanism\nthan any other process, high or low, of man\u2019s interior life?\nBefore proceeding to answer this question, I must ask you to listen to\nsome more psychological remarks. At our last lecture, I explained the\nshifting of men\u2019s centres of personal energy within them and the lighting\nup of new crises of emotion. I explained the phenomena as partly due to\nexplicitly conscious processes of thought and will, but as due largely\nalso to the subconscious incubation and maturing of motives deposited by\nthe experiences of life. When ripe, the results hatch out, or burst into\nflower. I have now to speak of the subconscious region, in which such\nprocesses of flowering may occur, in a somewhat less vague way. I only\nregret that my limits of time here force me to be so short.\nThe expression \u201cfield of consciousness\u201d has but recently come into vogue\nin the psychology books. Until quite lately the unit of mental life which\nfigured most was the single \u201cidea\u201d supposed to be a definitely outlined\nthing. But at present psychologists are tending, first, to admit that the\nactual unit is more probably the total mental state, the entire wave of\nconsciousness or field of objects present to the thought at any time; and,\nsecond, to see that it is impossible to outline this wave, this field,\nwith any definiteness.\nAs our mental fields succeed one another, each has its centre of interest,\naround which the objects of which we are less and less attentively\nconscious fade to a margin so faint that its limits are unassignable. Some\nfields are narrow fields and some are wide fields. Usually when we have a\nwide field we rejoice, for we then see masses of truth together, and often\nget glimpses of relations which we divine rather than see, for they shoot\nbeyond the field into still remoter regions of objectivity, regions which\nwe seem rather to be about to perceive than to perceive actually. At other\ntimes, of drowsiness, illness, or fatigue, our fields may narrow almost to\na point, and we find ourselves correspondingly oppressed and contracted.\nDifferent individuals present constitutional differences in this matter of\nwidth of field. Your great organizing geniuses are men with habitually\nvast fields of mental vision, in which a whole programme of future\noperations will appear dotted out at once, the rays shooting far ahead\ninto definite directions of advance. In common people there is never this\nmagnificent inclusive view of a topic. They stumble along, feeling their\nway, as it were, from point to point, and often stop entirely. In certain\ndiseased conditions consciousness is a mere spark, without memory of the\npast or thought of the future, and with the present narrowed down to some\none simple emotion or sensation of the body.\nThe important fact which this \u201cfield\u201d formula commemorates is the\nindetermination of the margin. Inattentively realized as is the matter\nwhich the margin contains, it is nevertheless there, and helps both to\nguide our behavior and to determine the next movement of our attention. It\nlies around us like a \u201cmagnetic field,\u201d inside of which our centre of\nenergy turns like a compass\u2010needle, as the present phase of consciousness\nalters into its successor. Our whole past store of memories floats beyond\nthis margin, ready at a touch to come in; and the entire mass of residual\npowers, impulses, and knowledges that constitute our empirical self\nstretches continuously beyond it. So vaguely drawn are the outlines\nbetween what is actual and what is only potential at any moment of our\nconscious life, that it is always hard to say of certain mental elements\nwhether we are conscious of them or not.\nThe ordinary psychology, admitting fully the difficulty of tracing the\nmarginal outline, has nevertheless taken for granted, first, that all the\nconsciousness the person now has, be the same focal or marginal,\ninattentive or attentive, is there in the \u201cfield\u201d of the moment, all dim\nand impossible to assign as the latter\u2019s outline may be; and, second, that\nwhat is absolutely extra\u2010marginal is absolutely non\u2010existent, and cannot\nbe a fact of consciousness at all.\nAnd having reached this point, I must now ask you to recall what I said in\nmy last lecture about the subconscious life. I said, as you may recollect,\nthat those who first laid stress upon these phenomena could not know the\nfacts as we now know them. My first duty now is to tell you what I meant\nby such a statement.\nI cannot but think that the most important step forward that has occurred\nin psychology since I have been a student of that science is the\ndiscovery, first made in 1886, that, in certain subjects at least, there\nis not only the consciousness of the ordinary field, with its usual centre\nand margin, but an addition thereto in the shape of a set of memories,\nthoughts, and feelings which are extra\u2010marginal and outside of the primary\nconsciousness altogether, but yet must be classed as conscious facts of\nsome sort, able to reveal their presence by unmistakable signs. I call\nthis the most important step forward because, unlike the other advances\nwhich psychology has made, this discovery has revealed to us an entirely\nunsuspected peculiarity in the constitution of human nature. No other step\nforward which psychology has made can proffer any such claim as this.\nIn particular this discovery of a consciousness existing beyond the field,\nor subliminally as Mr. Myers terms it, casts light on many phenomena of\nreligious biography. That is why I have to advert to it now, although it\nis naturally impossible for me in this place to give you any account of\nthe evidence on which the admission of such a consciousness is based. You\nwill find it set forth in many recent books, Binet\u2019s Alterations of\nPersonality(122) being perhaps as good a one as any to recommend.\nThe human material on which the demonstration has been made has so far\nbeen rather limited and, in part at least, eccentric, consisting of\nunusually suggestible hypnotic subjects, and of hysteric patients. Yet the\nelementary mechanisms of our life are presumably so uniform that what is\nshown to be true in a marked degree of some persons is probably true in\nsome degree of all, and may in a few be true in an extraordinarily high\ndegree.\nThe most important consequence of having a strongly developed ultra\u2010\nmarginal life of this sort is that one\u2019s ordinary fields of consciousness\nare liable to incursions from it of which the subject does not guess the\nsource, and which, therefore, take for him the form of unaccountable\nimpulses to act, or inhibitions of action, of obsessive ideas, or even of\nhallucinations of sight or hearing. The impulses may take the direction of\nautomatic speech or writing, the meaning of which the subject himself may\nnot understand even while he utters it; and generalizing this phenomenon,\nMr. Myers has given the name of _automatism_, sensory or motor, emotional\nor intellectual, to this whole sphere of effects, due to \u201cuprushes\u201d into\nthe ordinary consciousness of energies originating in the subliminal parts\nof the mind.\nThe simplest instance of an automatism is the phenomenon of post\u2010hypnotic\nsuggestion, so\u2010called. You give to a hypnotized subject, adequately\nsusceptible, an order to perform some designated act\u2014usual or eccentric,\nit makes no difference\u2014after he wakes from his hypnotic sleep. Punctually,\nwhen the signal comes or the time elapses upon which you have told him\nthat the act must ensue, he performs it;\u2014but in so doing he has no\nrecollection of your suggestion, and he always trumps up an improvised\npretext for his behavior if the act be of an eccentric kind. It may even\nbe suggested to a subject to have a vision or to hear a voice at a certain\ninterval after waking, and when the time comes the vision is seen or the\nvoice heard, with no inkling on the subject\u2019s part of its source. In the\nwonderful explorations by Binet, Janet, Breuer, Freud, Mason, Prince, and\nothers, of the subliminal consciousness of patients with hysteria, we have\nrevealed to us whole systems of underground life, in the shape of memories\nof a painful sort which lead a parasitic existence, buried outside of the\nprimary fields of consciousness, and making irruptions thereinto with\nhallucinations, pains, convulsions, paralyses of feeling and of motion,\nand the whole procession of symptoms of hysteric disease of body and of\nmind. Alter or abolish by suggestion these subconscious memories, and the\npatient immediately gets well. His symptoms were automatisms, in Mr.\nMyers\u2019s sense of the word. These clinical records sound like fairy\u2010tales\nwhen one first reads them, yet it is impossible to doubt their accuracy;\nand, the path having been once opened by these first observers, similar\nobservations have been made elsewhere. They throw, as I said, a wholly new\nlight upon our natural constitution.\nAnd it seems to me that they make a farther step inevitable. Interpreting\nthe unknown after the analogy of the known, it seems to me that hereafter,\nwherever we meet with a phenomenon of automatism, be it motor impulses, or\nobsessive idea, or unaccountable caprice, or delusion, or hallucination,\nwe are bound first of all to make search whether it be not an explosion,\ninto the fields of ordinary consciousness, of ideas elaborated outside of\nthose fields in subliminal regions of the mind. We should look, therefore,\nfor its source in the Subject\u2019s subconscious life. In the hypnotic cases,\nwe ourselves create the source by our suggestion, so we know it directly.\nIn the hysteric cases, the lost memories which are the source have to be\nextracted from the patient\u2019s Subliminal by a number of ingenious methods,\nfor an account of which you must consult the books. In other pathological\ncases, insane delusions, for example, or psychopathic obsessions, the\nsource is yet to seek, but by analogy it also should be in subliminal\nregions which improvements in our methods may yet conceivably put on tap.\nThere lies the mechanism logically to be assumed,\u2014but the assumption\ninvolves a vast program of work to be done in the way of verification, in\nwhich the religious experiences of man must play their part.(123)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nAnd thus I return to our own specific subject of instantaneous\nconversions. You remember the cases of Alline, Bradley, Brainerd, and the\ngraduate of Oxford converted at three in the afternoon. Similar\noccurrences abound, some with and some without luminous visions, all with\na sense of astonished happiness, and of being wrought on by a higher\ncontrol. If, abstracting altogether from the question of their value for\nthe future spiritual life of the individual, we take them on their\npsychological side exclusively, so many peculiarities in them remind us of\nwhat we find outside of conversion that we are tempted to class them along\nwith other automatisms, and to suspect that what makes the difference\nbetween a sudden and a gradual convert is not necessarily the presence of\ndivine miracle in the case of one and of something less divine in that of\nthe other, but rather a simple psychological peculiarity, the fact,\nnamely, that in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we have one\nof those Subjects who are in possession of a large region in which mental\nwork can go on subliminally, and from which invasive experiences, abruptly\nupsetting the equilibrium of the primary consciousness, may come.\nI do not see why Methodists need object to such a view. Pray go back and\nrecollect one of the conclusions to which I sought to lead you in my very\nfirst lecture. You may remember how I there argued against the notion that\nthe worth of a thing can be decided by its origin. Our spiritual judgment,\nI said, our opinion of the significance and value of a human event or\ncondition, must be decided on empirical grounds exclusively. If the\n_fruits for life_ of the state of conversion are good, we ought to\nidealize and venerate it, even though it be a piece of natural psychology;\nif not, we ought to make short work with it, no matter what supernatural\nbeing may have infused it.\nWell, how is it with these fruits? If we except the class of pre\u00ebminent\nsaints of whom the names illumine history, and consider only the usual run\nof \u201csaints,\u201d the shopkeeping church\u2010members and ordinary youthful or\nmiddle\u2010aged recipients of instantaneous conversion, whether at revivals or\nin the spontaneous course of methodistic growth, you will probably agree\nthat no splendor worthy of a wholly supernatural creature fulgurates from\nthem, or sets them apart from the mortals who have never experienced that\nfavor. Were it true that a suddenly converted man as such is, as Edwards\nsays,(124) of an entirely different kind from a natural man, partaking as\nhe does directly of Christ\u2019s substance, there surely ought to be some\nexquisite class\u2010mark, some distinctive radiance attaching even to the\nlowliest specimen of this genus, to which no one of us could remain\ninsensible, and which, so far as it went, would prove him more excellent\nthan ever the most highly gifted among mere natural men. But notoriously\nthere is no such radiance. Converted men as a class are indistinguishable\nfrom natural men; some natural men even excel some converted men in their\nfruits; and no one ignorant of doctrinal theology could guess by mere\nevery\u2010day inspection of the \u201caccidents\u201d of the two groups of persons\nbefore him, that their substance differed as much as divine differs from\nhuman substance.\nThe believers in the non\u2010natural character of sudden conversion have had\npractically to admit that there is no unmistakable class\u2010mark distinctive\nof all true converts. The super\u2010normal incidents, such as voices and\nvisions and overpowering impressions of the meaning of suddenly presented\nscripture texts, the melting emotions and tumultuous affections connected\nwith the crisis of change, may all come by way of nature, or worse still,\nbe counterfeited by Satan. The real witness of the spirit to the second\nbirth is to be found only in the disposition of the genuine child of God,\nthe permanently patient heart, the love of self eradicated. And this, it\nhas to be admitted, is also found in those who pass no crisis, and may\neven be found outside of Christianity altogether.\nThroughout Jonathan Edwards\u2019s admirably rich and delicate description of\nthe supernaturally infused condition, in his Treatise on Religious\nAffections, there is not one decisive trait, not one mark, that\nunmistakably parts it off from what may possibly be only an exceptionally\nhigh degree of natural goodness. In fact, one could hardly read a clearer\nargument than this book unwittingly offers in favor of the thesis that no\nchasm exists between the orders of human excellence, but that here as\nelsewhere, nature shows continuous differences, and generation and\nregeneration are matters of degree.\nAll which denial of two objective classes of human beings separated by a\nchasm must not leave us blind to the extraordinary momentousness of the\nfact of his conversion to the individual himself who gets converted. There\nare higher and lower limits of possibility set to each personal life. If a\nflood but goes above one\u2019s head, its absolute elevation becomes a matter\nof small importance; and when we touch our own upper limit and live in our\nown highest centre of energy, we may call ourselves saved, no matter how\nmuch higher some one else\u2019s centre may be. A small man\u2019s salvation will\nalways be a great salvation and the greatest of all facts _for him_, and\nwe should remember this when the fruits of our ordinary evangelicism look\ndiscouraging. Who knows how much less ideal still the lives of these\nspiritual grubs and earthworms, these Crumps and Stigginses, might have\nbeen, if such poor grace as they have received had never touched them at\nall?(125)\nIf we roughly arrange human beings in classes, each class standing for a\ngrade of spiritual excellence, I believe we shall find natural men and\nconverts both sudden and gradual in all the classes. The forms which\nregenerative change effects have, then, no general spiritual significance,\nbut only a psychological significance. We have seen how Starbuck\u2019s\nlaborious statistical studies tend to assimilate conversion to ordinary\nspiritual growth. Another American psychologist, Prof. George A. Coe,(126)\nhas analyzed the cases of seventy\u2010seven converts or ex\u2010candidates for\nconversion, known to him, and the results strikingly confirm the view that\nsudden conversion is connected with the possession of an active subliminal\nself. Examining his subjects with reference to their hypnotic sensibility\nand to such automatisms as hypnagogic hallucinations, odd impulses,\nreligious dreams about the time of their conversion, etc., he found these\nrelatively much more frequent in the group of converts whose\ntransformation had been \u201cstriking,\u201d \u201cstriking\u201d transformation being\ndefined as a change which, though not necessarily instantaneous, seems to\nthe subject of it to be distinctly different from a process of growth,\nhowever rapid.(127) Candidates for conversion at revivals are, as you\nknow, often disappointed: they experience nothing striking. Professor Coe\nhad a number of persons of this class among his seventy\u2010seven subjects,\nand they almost all, when tested by hypnotism, proved to belong to a\nsubclass which he calls \u201cspontaneous,\u201d that is, fertile in self\u2010\nsuggestions, as distinguished from a \u201cpassive\u201d subclass, to which most of\nthe subjects of striking transformation belonged. His inference is that\nself\u2010suggestion of impossibility had prevented the influence upon these\npersons of an environment which, on the more \u201cpassive\u201d subjects, had\neasily brought forth the effects they looked for. Sharp distinctions are\ndifficult in these regions, and Professor Coe\u2019s numbers are small. But his\nmethods were careful, and the results tally with what one might expect;\nand they seem, on the whole, to justify his practical conclusion, which is\nthat if you should expose to a converting influence a subject in whom\nthree factors unite: first, pronounced emotional sensibility; second,\ntendency to automatisms; and third, suggestibility of the passive type;\nyou might then safely predict the result: there would be a sudden\nconversion, a transformation of the striking kind.\nDoes this temperamental origin diminish the significance of the sudden\nconversion when it has occurred? Not in the least, as Professor Coe well\nsays; for \u201cthe ultimate test of religious values is nothing psychological,\nnothing definable in terms of _how it happens_, but something ethical,\ndefinable only in terms of _what is attained_.\u201d(128)\nAs we proceed farther in our inquiry we shall see that what is attained is\noften an altogether new level of spiritual vitality, a relatively heroic\nlevel, in which impossible things have become possible, and new energies\nand endurances are shown. The personality is changed, the man _is_ born\nanew, whether or not his psychological idiosyncrasies are what give the\nparticular shape to his metamorphosis. \u201cSanctification\u201d is the technical\nname of this result; and erelong examples of it shall be brought before\nyou. In this lecture I have still only to add a few remarks on the\nassurance and peace which fill the hour of change itself.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOne word more, though, before proceeding to that point, lest the final\npurpose of my explanation of suddenness by subliminal activity be\nmisunderstood. I do indeed believe that if the Subject have no liability\nto such subconscious activity, or if his conscious fields have a hard rind\nof a margin that resists incursions from beyond it, his conversion must be\ngradual if it occur, and must resemble any simple growth into new habits.\nHis possession of a developed subliminal self, and of a leaky or pervious\nmargin, is thus a _conditio sine qua non_ of the Subject\u2019s becoming\nconverted in the instantaneous way. But if you, being orthodox Christians,\nask me as a psychologist whether the reference of a phenomenon to a\nsubliminal self does not exclude the notion of the direct presence of the\nDeity altogether, I have to say frankly that as a psychologist I do not\nsee why it necessarily should. The lower manifestations of the Subliminal,\nindeed, fall within the resources of the personal subject: his ordinary\nsense\u2010material, inattentively taken in and subconsciously remembered and\ncombined, will account for all his usual automatisms. But just as our\nprimary wide\u2010awake consciousness throws open our senses to the touch of\nthings material, so it is logically conceivable that _if there be_ higher\nspiritual agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological condition\nof their doing so _might be_ our possession of a subconscious region which\nalone should yield access to them. The hubbub of the waking life might\nclose a door which in the dreamy Subliminal might remain ajar or open.\nThus that perception of external control which is so essential a feature\nin conversion might, in some cases at any rate, be interpreted as the\northodox interpret it: forces transcending the finite individual might\nimpress him, on condition of his being what we may call a subliminal human\nspecimen. But in any case the _value_ of these forces would have to be\ndetermined by their effects, and the mere fact of their transcendency\nwould of itself establish no presumption that they were more divine than\ndiabolical.\nI confess that this is the way in which I should rather see the topic left\nlying in your minds until I come to a much later lecture, when I hope once\nmore to gather these dropped threads together into more definitive\nconclusions. The notion of a subconscious self certainly ought not at this\npoint of our inquiry to be held to _exclude_ all notion of a higher\npenetration. If there be higher powers able to impress us, they may get\naccess to us only through the subliminal door. (See below, p. 515 ff.)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLet us turn now to the feelings which immediately fill the hour of the\nconversion experience. The first one to be noted is just this sense of\nhigher control. It is not always, but it is very often present. We saw\nexamples of it in Alline, Bradley, Brainerd, and elsewhere. The need of\nsuch a higher controlling agency is well expressed in the short reference\nwhich the eminent French Protestant Adolphe Monod makes to the crisis of\nhis own conversion. It was at Naples in his early manhood, in the summer\nof 1827.\n\u201cMy sadness,\u201d he says, \u201cwas without limit, and having got entire\npossession of me, it filled my life from the most indifferent\nexternal acts to the most secret thoughts, and corrupted at their\nsource my feelings, my judgment, and my happiness. It was then\nthat I saw that to expect to put a stop to this disorder by my\nreason and my will, which were themselves diseased, would be to\nact like a blind man who should pretend to correct one of his eyes\nby the aid of the other equally blind one. I had then no resource\nsave in _some influence from without_. I remembered the promise of\nthe Holy Ghost; and what the positive declarations of the Gospel\nhad never succeeded in bringing home to me, I learned at last from\nnecessity, and believed, for the first time in my life, in this\npromise, in the only sense in which it answered the needs of my\nsoul, in that, namely, of a real external supernatural action,\ncapable of giving me thoughts, and taking them away from me, and\nexerted on me by a God as truly master of my heart as he is of the\nrest of nature. Renouncing then all merit, all strength,\nabandoning all my personal resources, and acknowledging no other\ntitle to his mercy than my own utter misery, I went home and threw\nmyself on my knees, and prayed as I never yet prayed in my life.\nFrom this day onwards a new interior life began for me: not that\nmy melancholy had disappeared, but it had lost its sting. Hope had\nentered into my heart, and once entered on the path, the God of\nJesus Christ, to whom I then had learned to give myself up, little\nby little did the rest.\u201d(129)\nIt is needless to remind you once more of the admirable congruity of\nProtestant theology with the structure of the mind as shown in such\nexperiences. In the extreme of melancholy the self that consciously _is_\ncan do absolutely nothing. It is completely bankrupt and without resource,\nand no works it can accomplish will avail. Redemption from such subjective\nconditions must be a free gift or nothing, and grace through Christ\u2019s\naccomplished sacrifice is such a gift.\n\u201cGod,\u201d says Luther, \u201cis the God of the humble, the miserable, the\noppressed, and the desperate, and of those that are brought even\nto nothing; and his nature is to give sight to the blind, to\ncomfort the broken\u2010hearted, to justify sinners, to save the very\ndesperate and damned. Now that pernicious and pestilent opinion of\nman\u2019s own righteousness, which will not be a sinner, unclean,\nmiserable, and damnable, but righteous and holy, suffereth not God\nto come to his own natural and proper work. Therefore God must\ntake this maul in hand (the law, I mean) to beat in pieces and\nbring to nothing this beast with her vain confidence, that she may\nso learn at length by her own misery that she is utterly forlorn\nand damned. But here lieth the difficulty, that when a man is\nterrified and cast down, he is so little able to raise himself up\nagain and say, \u2018Now I am bruised and afflicted enough; now is the\ntime of grace; now is the time to hear Christ.\u2019 The foolishness of\nman\u2019s heart is so great that then he rather seeketh to himself\nmore laws to satisfy his conscience. \u2018If I live,\u2019 saith he, \u2018I\nwill amend my life: I will do this, I will do that.\u2019 But here,\nexcept thou do the quite contrary, except thou send Moses away\nwith his law, and in these terrors and this anguish lay hold upon\nChrist who died for thy sins, look for no salvation. Thy cowl, thy\nshaven crown, thy chastity, thy obedience, thy poverty, thy works,\nthy merits? what shall all these do? what shall the law of Moses\navail? If I, wretched and damnable sinner, through works or merits\ncould have loved the Son of God, and so come to him, what needed\nhe to deliver himself for me? If I, being a wretch and damned\nsinner, could be redeemed by any other price, what needed the Son\nof God to be given? But because there was no other price,\ntherefore he delivered neither sheep, ox, gold, nor silver, but\neven God himself, entirely and wholly \u2018for me,\u2019 even \u2018for me,\u2019 I\nsay, a miserable, wretched sinner. Now, therefore, I take comfort\nand apply this to _myself_. And this manner of applying is the\nvery true force and power of faith. For he died _not_ to justify\nthe righteous, but the _un_\u2010righteous, and to make _them_ the\nchildren of God.\u201d(130)\nThat is, the more literally lost you are, the more literally you are the\nvery being whom Christ\u2019s sacrifice has already saved. Nothing in Catholic\ntheology, I imagine, has ever spoken to sick souls as straight as this\nmessage from Luther\u2019s personal experience. As Protestants are not all sick\nsouls, of course reliance on what Luther exults in calling the dung of\none\u2019s merits, the filthy puddle of one\u2019s own righteousness, has come to\nthe front again in their religion; but the adequacy of his view of\nChristianity to the deeper parts of our human mental structure is shown by\nits wildfire contagiousness when it was a new and quickening thing.\nFaith that Christ has genuinely done his work was part of what Luther\nmeant by faith, which so far is faith in a fact intellectually conceived\nof. But this is only one part of Luther\u2019s faith, the other part being far\nmore vital. This other part is something not intellectual but immediate\nand intuitive, the assurance, namely, that I, this individual I, just as I\nstand, without one plea, etc., am saved now and forever.(131)\nProfessor Leuba is undoubtedly right in contending that the conceptual\nbelief about Christ\u2019s work, although so often efficacious and antecedent,\nis really accessory and non\u2010essential, and that the \u201cjoyous conviction\u201d\ncan also come by far other channels than this conception. It is to the\njoyous conviction itself, the assurance that all is well with one, that he\nwould give the name of faith _par excellence_.\n\u201cWhen the sense of estrangement,\u201d he writes, \u201cfencing man about in\na narrowly limited ego, breaks down, the individual finds himself\n\u2018at one with all creation.\u2019 He lives in the universal life; he and\nman, he and nature, he and God, are one. That state of confidence,\ntrust, union with all things, following upon the achievement of\nmoral unity, is the _Faith\u2010state_. Various dogmatic beliefs\nsuddenly, on the advent of the faith\u2010state, acquire a character of\ncertainty, assume a new reality, become an object of faith. As the\nground of assurance here is not rational, argumentation is\nirrelevant. But such conviction being a mere casual offshoot of\nthe faith\u2010state, it is a gross error to imagine that the chief\npractical value of the faith\u2010state is its power to stamp with the\nseal of reality certain particular theological conceptions.(132)\nOn the contrary, its value lies solely in the fact that it is the\npsychic correlate of a biological growth reducing contending\ndesires to one direction; a growth which expresses itself in new\naffective states and new reactions; in larger, nobler, more\nChrist\u2010like activities. The ground of the specific assurance in\nreligious dogmas is then an affective experience. The objects of\nfaith may even be preposterous; the affective stream will float\nthem along, and invest them with unshakable certitude. The more\nstartling the affective experience, the less explicable it seems,\nthe easier it is to make it the carrier of unsubstantiated\nnotions.\u201d(133)\nThe characteristics of the affective experience which, to avoid ambiguity,\nshould, I think, be called the state of assurance rather than the faith\u2010\nstate, can be easily enumerated, though it is probably difficult to\nrealize their intensity, unless one have been through the experience one\u2019s\nself.\nThe central one is the loss of all the worry, the sense that all is\nultimately well with one, the peace, the harmony, the _willingness to be_,\neven though the outer conditions should remain the same. The certainty of\nGod\u2019s \u201cgrace,\u201d of \u201cjustification,\u201d \u201csalvation,\u201d is an objective belief\nthat usually accompanies the change in Christians; but this may be\nentirely lacking and yet the affective peace remain the same\u2014you will\nrecollect the case of the Oxford graduate: and many might be given where\nthe assurance of personal salvation was only a later result. A passion of\nwillingness, of acquiescence, of admiration, is the glowing centre of this\nstate of mind.\nThe second feature is the sense of perceiving truths not known before. The\nmysteries of life become lucid, as Professor Leuba says; and often, nay\nusually, the solution is more or less unutterable in words. But these more\nintellectual phenomena may be postponed until we treat of mysticism.\nA third peculiarity of the assurance state is the objective change which\nthe world often appears to undergo. \u201cAn appearance of newness beautifies\nevery object,\u201d the precise opposite of that other sort of newness, that\ndreadful unreality and strangeness in the appearance of the world, which\nis experienced by melancholy patients, and of which you may recall my\nrelating some examples.(134) This sense of clean and beautiful newness\nwithin and without is one of the commonest entries in conversion records.\nJonathan Edwards thus describes it in himself:\u2014\n\u201cAfter this my sense of divine things gradually increased, and\nbecame more and more lively, and had more of that inward\nsweetness. The appearance of everything was altered; there seemed\nto be, as it were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine\nglory, in almost everything. God\u2019s excellency, his wisdom, his\npurity and love, seemed to appear in everything; in the sun, moon,\nand stars; in the clouds and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, and\ntrees; in the water and all nature; which used greatly to fix my\nmind. And scarce anything, among all the works of nature, was so\nsweet to me as thunder and lightning; formerly nothing had been so\nterrible to me. Before, I used to be uncommonly terrified with\nthunder, and to be struck with terror when I saw a thunderstorm\nrising; but now, on the contrary, it rejoices me.\u201d(135)\nBilly Bray, an excellent little illiterate English evangelist, records his\nsense of newness thus:\u2014\n\u201cI said to the Lord: \u2018Thou hast said, they that ask shall receive,\nthey that seek shall find, and to them that knock the door shall\nbe opened, and I have faith to believe it.\u2019 In an instant the Lord\nmade me so happy that I cannot express what I felt. I shouted for\njoy. I praised God with my whole heart.... I think this was in\nNovember, 1823, but what day of the month I do not know. I\nremember this, that everything looked new to me, the people, the\nfields, the cattle, the trees. I was like a new man in a new\nworld. I spent the greater part of my time in praising the\nLord.\u201d(136)\nStarbuck and Leuba both illustrate this sense of newness by quotations. I\ntake the two following from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection. One, a\nwoman, says:\u2014\n\u201cI was taken to a camp\u2010meeting, mother and religious friends\nseeking and praying for my conversion. My emotional nature was\nstirred to its depths; confessions of depravity and pleading with\nGod for salvation from sin made me oblivious of all surroundings.\nI plead for mercy, and had a vivid realization of forgiveness and\nrenewal of my nature. When rising from my knees I exclaimed, \u2018Old\nthings have passed away, all things have become new.\u2019 It was like\nentering another world, a new state of existence. Natural objects\nwere glorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw\nbeauty in every material object in the universe, the woods were\nvocal with heavenly music; my soul exulted in the love of God, and\nI wanted everybody to share in my joy.\u201d\nThe next case is that of a man:\u2014\n\u201cI know not how I got back into the encampment, but found myself\nstaggering up to Rev. \u2014\u2014\u2019s Holiness tent\u2014and as it was full of\nseekers and a terrible noise inside, some groaning, some laughing,\nand some shouting, and by a large oak, ten feet from the tent, I\nfell on my face by a bench, and tried to pray, and every time I\nwould call on God, something like a man\u2019s hand would strangle me\nby choking. I don\u2019t know whether there were any one around or near\nme or not. I thought I should surely die if I did not get help,\nbut just as often as I would pray, that unseen hand was felt on my\nthroat and my breath squeezed off. Finally something said:\n\u2018Venture on the atonement, for you will die anyway if you don\u2019t.\u2019\nSo I made one final struggle to call on God for mercy, with the\nsame choking and strangling, determined to finish the sentence of\nprayer for Mercy, if I did strangle and die, and the last I\nremember that time was falling back on the ground with the same\nunseen hand on my throat. I don\u2019t know how long I lay there or\nwhat was going on. None of my folks were present. When I came to\nmyself, there were a crowd around me praising God. The very\nheavens seemed to open and pour down rays of light and glory. Not\nfor a moment only, but all day and night, floods of light and\nglory seemed to pour through my soul, and oh, how I was changed,\nand everything became new. My horses and hogs and even everybody\nseemed changed.\u201d\nThis man\u2019s case introduces the feature of automatisms, which in\nsuggestible subjects have been so startling a feature at revivals since,\nin Edwards\u2019s, Wesley\u2019s, and Whitfield\u2019s time, these became a regular means\nof gospel propagation. They were at first supposed to be semi\u2010miraculous\nproofs of \u201cpower\u201d on the part of the Holy Ghost; but great divergence of\nopinion quickly arose concerning them. Edwards, in his Thoughts on the\nRevival of Religion in New England, has to defend them against their\ncritics; and their value has long been matter of debate even within the\nrevivalistic denominations.(137) They undoubtedly have no essential\nspiritual significance, and although their presence makes his conversion\nmore memorable to the convert, it has never been proved that converts who\nshow them are more persevering or fertile in good fruits than those whose\nchange of heart has had less violent accompaniments. On the whole,\nunconsciousness, convulsions, visions, involuntary vocal utterances, and\nsuffocation, must be simply ascribed to the subject\u2019s having a large\nsubliminal region, involving nervous instability. This is often the\nsubject\u2019s own view of the matter afterwards. One of Starbuck\u2019s\ncorrespondents writes, for instance:\u2014\n\u201cI have been through the experience which is known as conversion.\nMy explanation of it is this: the subject works his emotions up to\nthe breaking point, at the same time resisting their physical\nmanifestations, such as quickened pulse, etc., and then suddenly\nlets them have their full sway over his body. The relief is\nsomething wonderful, and the pleasurable effects of the emotions\nare experienced to the highest degree.\u201d\nThere is one form of sensory automatism which possibly deserves special\nnotice on account of its frequency. I refer to hallucinatory or pseudo\u2010\nhallucinatory luminous phenomena, _photisms_, to use the term of the\npsychologists. Saint Paul\u2019s blinding heavenly vision seems to have been a\nphenomenon of this sort; so does Constantine\u2019s cross in the sky. The last\ncase but one which I quoted mentions floods of light and glory. Henry\nAlline mentions a light, about whose externality he seems uncertain.\nColonel Gardiner sees a blazing light. President Finney writes:\u2014\n\u201cAll at once the glory of God shone upon and round about me in a\nmanner almost marvelous.... A light perfectly ineffable shone in\nmy soul, that almost prostrated me on the ground.... This light\nseemed like the brightness of the sun in every direction. It was\ntoo intense for the eyes.... I think I knew something then, by\nactual experience, of that light that prostrated Paul on the way\nto Damascus. It was surely a light such as I could not have\nendured long.\u201d(138)\nSuch reports of photisms are indeed far from uncommon. Here is another\nfrom Starbuck\u2019s collection, where the light appeared evidently external:\u2014\n\u201cI had attended a series of revival services for about two weeks\noff and on. Had been invited to the altar several times, all the\ntime becoming more deeply impressed, when finally I decided I must\ndo this, or I should be lost. Realization of conversion was very\nvivid, like a ton\u2019s weight being lifted from my heart; a strange\nlight which seemed to light up the whole room (for it was dark); a\nconscious supreme bliss which caused me to repeat \u2018Glory to God\u2019\nfor a long time. Decided to be God\u2019s child for life, and to give\nup my pet ambition, wealth and social position. My former habits\nof life hindered my growth somewhat, but I set about overcoming\nthese systematically, and in one year my whole nature was changed,\ni.e., my ambitions were of a different order.\u201d\nHere is another one of Starbuck\u2019s cases, involving a luminous element:\u2014\n\u201cI had been clearly converted twenty\u2010three years before, or rather\nreclaimed. My experience in regeneration was then clear and\nspiritual, and I had not backslidden. But I experienced entire\nsanctification on the 15th day of March, 1893, about eleven\no\u2019clock in the morning. The particular accompaniments of the\nexperience were entirely unexpected. I was quietly sitting at home\nsinging selections out of Pentecostal Hymns. Suddenly there seemed\nto be a something sweeping into me and inflating my entire\nbeing\u2014such a sensation as I had never experienced before. When\nthis experience came, I seemed to be conducted around a large,\ncapacious, well\u2010lighted room. As I walked with my invisible\nconductor and looked around, a clear thought was coined in my\nmind, \u2018They are not here, they are gone.\u2019 As soon as the thought\nwas definitely formed in my mind, though no word was spoken, the\nHoly Spirit impressed me that I was surveying my own soul. Then,\nfor the first time in all my life, did I know that I was cleansed\nfrom all sin, and filled with the fullness of God.\u201d\nLeuba quotes the case of a Mr. Peek, where the luminous affection reminds\none of the chromatic hallucinations produced by the intoxicant cactus buds\ncalled mescal by the Mexicans:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I went in the morning into the fields to work, the glory of\nGod appeared in all his visible creation. I well remember we\nreaped oats, and how every straw and head of the oats seemed, as\nit were, arrayed in a kind of rainbow glory, or to glow, if I may\nso express it, in the glory of God.\u201d(139)\nThe most characteristic of all the elements of the conversion crisis, and\nthe last one of which I shall speak, is the ecstasy of happiness produced.\nWe have already heard several accounts of it, but I will add a couple\nmore. President Finney\u2019s is so vivid that I give it at length:\u2014\n\u201cAll my feelings seemed to rise and flow out; and the utterance of\nmy heart was, \u2018I want to pour my whole soul out to God.\u2019 The\nrising of my soul was so great that I rushed into the back room of\nthe front office, to pray. There was no fire and no light in the\nroom; nevertheless it appeared to me as if it were perfectly\nlight. As I went in and shut the door after me, it seemed as if I\nmet the Lord Jesus Christ face to face. It did not occur to me\nthen, nor did it for some time afterwards, that it was wholly a\nmental state. On the contrary, it seemed to me that I saw him as I\nwould see any other man. He said nothing, but looked at me in such\na manner as to break me right down at his feet. I have always\nsince regarded this as a most remarkable state of mind; for it\nseemed to me a reality that he stood before me, and I fell down at\nhis feet and poured out my soul to him. I wept aloud like a child,\nand made such confessions as I could with my choked utterance. It\nseemed to me that I bathed his feet with my tears; and yet I had\nno distinct impression that I touched him, that I recollect. I\nmust have continued in this state for a good while; but my mind\nwas too much absorbed with the interview to recollect anything\nthat I said. But I know, as soon as my mind became calm enough to\nbreak off from the interview, I returned to the front office, and\nfound that the fire that I had made of large wood was nearly\nburned out. But as I turned and was about to take a seat by the\nfire, I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. Without any\nexpectation of it, without ever having the thought in my mind that\nthere was any such thing for me, without any recollection that I\nhad ever heard the thing mentioned by any person in the world, the\nHoly Spirit descended upon me in a manner that seemed to go\nthrough me, body and soul. I could feel the impression, like a\nwave of electricity, going through and through me. Indeed, it\nseemed to come in waves and waves of liquid love; for I could not\nexpress it in any other way. It seemed like the very breath of\nGod. I can recollect distinctly that it seemed to fan me, like\nimmense wings.\n\u201cNo words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in\nmy heart. I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do not know but I\nshould say I literally bellowed out the unutterable gushings of my\nheart. These waves came over me, and over me, and over me, one\nafter the other, until I recollect I cried out, \u2018I shall die if\nthese waves continue to pass over me.\u2019 I said, \u2018Lord, I cannot\nbear any more;\u2019 yet I had no fear of death.\n\u201cHow long I continued in this state, with this baptism continuing\nto roll over me and go through me, I do not know. But I know it\nwas late in the evening when a member of my choir\u2014for I was the\nleader of the choir\u2014came into the office to see me. He was a\nmember of the church. He found me in this state of loud weeping,\nand said to me, \u2018Mr. Finney, what ails you?\u2019 I could make him no\nanswer for some time. He then said, \u2018Are you in pain?\u2019 I gathered\nmyself up as best I could, and replied, \u2018No, but so happy that I\ncannot live.\u2019 \u201d\nI just now quoted Billy Bray; I cannot do better than give his own brief\naccount of his post\u2010conversion feelings:\u2014\n\u201cI can\u2019t help praising the Lord. As I go along the street, I lift\nup one foot, and it seems to say \u2018Glory\u2019; and I lift up the other,\nand it seems to say \u2018Amen\u2019; and so they keep up like that all the\ntime I am walking.\u201d(140)\nOne word, before I close this lecture, on the question of the transiency\nor permanence of these abrupt conversions. Some of you, I feel sure,\nknowing that numerous backslidings and relapses take place, make of these\ntheir apperceiving mass for interpreting the whole subject, and dismiss it\nwith a pitying smile at so much \u201chysterics.\u201d Psychologically, as well as\nreligiously, however, this is shallow. It misses the point of serious\ninterest, which is not so much the duration as the nature and quality of\nthese shiftings of character to higher levels. Men lapse from every\nlevel\u2014we need no statistics to tell us that. Love is, for instance, well\nknown not to be irrevocable, yet, constant or inconstant, it reveals new\nflights and reaches of ideality while it lasts. These revelations form its\nsignificance to men and women, whatever be its duration. So with the\nconversion experience: that it should for even a short time show a human\nbeing what the high\u2010water mark of his spiritual capacity is, this is what\nconstitutes its importance,\u2014an importance which backsliding cannot\ndiminish, although persistence might increase it. As a matter of fact, all\nthe more striking instances of conversion, all those, for instance, which\nI have quoted, _have_ been permanent. The case of which there might be\nmost doubt, on account of its suggesting so strongly an epileptoid\nseizure, was the case of M. Ratisbonne. Yet I am informed that\nRatisbonne\u2019s whole future was shaped by those few minutes. He gave up his\nproject of marriage, became a priest, founded at Jerusalem, where he went\nto dwell, a mission of nuns for the conversion of the Jews, showed no\ntendency to use for egotistic purposes the notoriety given him by the\npeculiar circumstances of his conversion,\u2014which, for the rest, he could\nseldom refer to without tears,\u2014and in short remained an exemplary son of\nthe Church until he died, late in the 80\u2019s, if I remember rightly.\nThe only statistics I know of, on the subject of the duration of\nconversions, are those collected for Professor Starbuck by Miss Johnston.\nThey embrace only a hundred persons, evangelical church\u2010members, more than\nhalf being Methodists. According to the statement of the subjects\nthemselves, there had been backsliding of some sort in nearly all the\ncases, 93 per cent. of the women, 77 per cent. of the men. Discussing the\nreturns more minutely, Starbuck finds that only 6 per cent. are relapses\nfrom the religious faith which the conversion confirmed, and that the\nbacksliding complained of is in most only a fluctuation in the ardor of\nsentiment. Only six of the hundred cases report a change of faith.\nStarbuck\u2019s conclusion is that the effect of conversion is to bring with it\n\u201ca changed attitude towards life, which is fairly constant and permanent,\nalthough the feelings fluctuate.... In other words, the persons who have\npassed through conversion, having once taken a stand for the religious\nlife, tend to feel themselves identified with it, no matter how much their\nreligious enthusiasm declines.\u201d(141)\nLECTURES XI, XII, AND XIII. SAINTLINESS.\nThe last lecture left us in a state of expectancy. What may the practical\nfruits for life have been, of such movingly happy conversions as those we\nheard of? With this question the really important part of our task opens,\nfor you remember that we began all this empirical inquiry not merely to\nopen a curious chapter in the natural history of human consciousness, but\nrather to attain a spiritual judgment as to the total value and positive\nmeaning of all the religious trouble and happiness which we have seen. We\nmust, therefore, first describe the fruits of the religious life, and then\nwe must judge them. This divides our inquiry into two distinct parts. Let\nus without further preamble proceed to the descriptive task.\nIt ought to be the pleasantest portion of our business in these lectures.\nSome small pieces of it, it is true, may be painful, or may show human\nnature in a pathetic light, but it will be mainly pleasant, because the\nbest fruits of religious experience are the best things that history has\nto show. They have always been esteemed so; here if anywhere is the\ngenuinely strenuous life; and to call to mind a succession of such\nexamples as I have lately had to wander through, though it has been only\nin the reading of them, is to feel encouraged and uplifted and washed in\nbetter moral air.\nThe highest flights of charity, devotion, trust, patience, bravery to\nwhich the wings of human nature have spread themselves have been flown for\nreligious ideals. I can do no better than quote, as to this, some remarks\nwhich Sainte\u2010Beuve in his History of Port\u2010Royal makes on the results of\nconversion or the state of grace.\n\u201cEven from the purely human point of view,\u201d Sainte\u2010Beuve says, \u201cthe\nphenomenon of grace must still appear sufficiently extraordinary, eminent,\nand rare, both in its nature and in its effects, to deserve a closer\nstudy. For the soul arrives thereby at a certain fixed and invincible\nstate, a state which is genuinely heroic, and from out of which the\ngreatest deeds which it ever performs are executed. Through all the\ndifferent forms of communion, and all the diversity of the means which\nhelp to produce this state, whether it be reached by a jubilee, by a\ngeneral confession, by a solitary prayer and effusion, whatever in short\nbe the place and the occasion, it is easy to recognize that it is\nfundamentally one state in spirit and in fruits. Penetrate a little\nbeneath the diversity of circumstances, and it becomes evident that in\nChristians of different epochs it is always one and the same modification\nby which they are affected: there is veritably a single fundamental and\nidentical spirit of piety and charity, common to those who have received\ngrace; an inner state which before all things is one of love and humility,\nof infinite confidence in God, and of severity for one\u2019s self, accompanied\nwith tenderness for others. The fruits peculiar to this condition of the\nsoul have the same savor in all, under distant suns and in different\nsurroundings, in Saint Teresa of Avila just as in any Moravian brother of\nHerrnhut.\u201d(142)\nSainte\u2010Beuve has here only the more eminent instances of regeneration in\nmind, and these are of course the instructive ones for us also to\nconsider. These devotees have often laid their course so differently from\nother men that, judging them by worldly law, we might be tempted to call\nthem monstrous aberrations from the path of nature. I begin, therefore, by\nasking a general psychological question as to what the inner conditions\nare which may make one human character differ so extremely from another.\nI reply at once that where the character, as something distinguished from\nthe intellect, is concerned, the causes of human diversity lie chiefly in\nour _differing susceptibilities of emotional excitement_, and in the\n_different impulses and inhibitions_ which these bring in their train. Let\nme make this more clear.\nSpeaking generally, our moral and practical attitude, at any given time,\nis always a resultant of two sets of forces within us, impulses pushing us\none way and obstructions and inhibitions holding us back. \u201cYes! yes!\u201d say\nthe impulses; \u201cNo! no!\u201d say the inhibitions. Few people who have not\nexpressly reflected on the matter realize how constantly this factor of\ninhibition is upon us, how it contains and moulds us by its restrictive\npressure almost as if we were fluids pent within the cavity of a jar. The\ninfluence is so incessant that it becomes subconscious. All of you, for\nexample, sit here with a certain constraint at this moment, and entirely\nwithout express consciousness of the fact, because of the influence of the\noccasion. If left alone in the room, each of you would probably\ninvoluntarily rearrange himself, and make his attitude more \u201cfree and\neasy.\u201d But proprieties and their inhibitions snap like cobwebs if any\ngreat emotional excitement supervenes. I have seen a dandy appear in the\nstreet with his face covered with shaving\u2010lather because a house across\nthe way was on fire; and a woman will run among strangers in her nightgown\nif it be a question of saving her baby\u2019s life or her own. Take a self\u2010\nindulgent woman\u2019s life in general. She will yield to every inhibition set\nby her disagreeable sensations, lie late in bed, live upon tea or\nbromides, keep indoors from the cold. Every difficulty finds her obedient\nto its \u201cno.\u201d But make a mother of her, and what have you? Possessed by\nmaternal excitement, she now confronts wakefulness, weariness, and toil\nwithout an instant of hesitation or a word of complaint. The inhibitive\npower of pain over her is extinguished wherever the baby\u2019s interests are\nat stake. The inconveniences which this creature occasions have become, as\nJames Hinton says, the glowing heart of a great joy, and indeed are now\nthe very conditions whereby the joy becomes most deep.\nThis is an example of what you have already heard of as the \u201cexpulsive\npower of a higher affection.\u201d But be the affection high or low, it makes\nno difference, so long as the excitement it brings be strong enough. In\none of Henry Drummond\u2019s discourses he tells of an inundation in India\nwhere an eminence with a bungalow upon it remained unsubmerged, and became\nthe refuge of a number of wild animals and reptiles in addition to the\nhuman beings who were there. At a certain moment a royal Bengal tiger\nappeared swimming towards it, reached it, and lay panting like a dog upon\nthe ground in the midst of the people, still possessed by such an agony of\nterror that one of the Englishmen could calmly step up with a rifle and\nblow out its brains. The tiger\u2019s habitual ferocity was temporarily quelled\nby the emotion of fear, which became sovereign, and formed a new centre\nfor his character.\nSometimes no emotional state is sovereign, but many contrary ones are\nmixed together. In that case one hears both \u201cyeses\u201d and \u201cnoes,\u201d and the\n\u201cwill\u201d is called on then to solve the conflict. Take a soldier, for\nexample, with his dread of cowardice impelling him to advance, his fears\nimpelling him to run, and his propensities to imitation pushing him\ntowards various courses if his comrades offer various examples. His person\nbecomes the seat of a mass of interferences; and he may for a time simply\nwaver, because no one emotion prevails. There is a pitch of intensity,\nthough, which, if any emotion reach it, enthrones that one as alone\neffective and sweeps its antagonists and all their inhibitions away. The\nfury of his comrades\u2019 charge, once entered on, will give this pitch of\ncourage to the soldier; the panic of their rout will give this pitch of\nfear. In these sovereign excitements, things ordinarily impossible grow\nnatural because the inhibitions are annulled. Their \u201cno! no!\u201d not only is\nnot heard, it does not exist. Obstacles are then like tissue\u2010paper hoops\nto the circus rider\u2014no impediment; the flood is higher than the dam they\nmake. \u201cLass sie betteln gehn wenn sie hungrig sind!\u201d cries the grenadier,\nfrantic over his Emperor\u2019s capture, when his wife and babes are suggested;\nand men pent into a burning theatre have been known to cut their way\nthrough the crowd with knives.(143)\nOne mode of emotional excitability is exceedingly important in the\ncomposition of the energetic character, from its peculiarly destructive\npower over inhibitions. I mean what in its lower form is mere\nirascibility, susceptibility to wrath, the fighting temper; and what in\nsubtler ways manifests itself as impatience, grimness, earnestness,\nseverity of character. Earnestness means willingness to live with energy,\nthough energy bring pain. The pain may be pain to other people or pain to\none\u2019s self\u2014it makes little difference; for when the strenuous mood is on\none, the aim is to break something, no matter whose or what. Nothing\nannihilates an inhibition as irresistibly as anger does it; for, as Moltke\nsays of war, destruction pure and simple is its essence. This is what\nmakes it so invaluable an ally of every other passion. The sweetest\ndelights are trampled on with a ferocious pleasure the moment they offer\nthemselves as checks to a cause by which our higher indignations are\nelicited. It costs then nothing to drop friendships, to renounce long\u2010\nrooted privileges and possessions, to break with social ties. Rather do we\ntake a stern joy in the astringency and desolation; and what is called\nweakness of character seems in most cases to consist in the inaptitude for\nthese sacrificial moods, of which one\u2019s own inferior self and its pet\nsoftnesses must often be the targets and the victims.(144)\nSo far I have spoken of temporary alterations produced by shifting\nexcitements in the same person. But the relatively fixed differences of\ncharacter of different persons are explained in a precisely similar way.\nIn a man with a liability to a special sort of emotion, whole ranges of\ninhibition habitually vanish, which in other men remain effective, and\nother sorts of inhibition take their place. When a person has an inborn\ngenius for certain emotions, his life differs strangely from that of\nordinary people, for none of their usual deterrents check him. Your mere\naspirant to a type of character, on the contrary, only shows, when your\nnatural lover, fighter, or reformer, with whom the passion is a gift of\nnature, comes along, the hopeless inferiority of voluntary to instinctive\naction. He has deliberately to overcome his inhibitions; the genius with\nthe inborn passion seems not to feel them at all; he is free of all that\ninner friction and nervous waste. To a Fox, a Garibaldi, a General Booth,\na John Brown, a Louise Michel, a Bradlaugh, the obstacles omnipotent over\nthose around them are as if non\u2010existent. Could the rest of us so\ndisregard them, there might be many such heroes, for many have the wish to\nlive for similar ideals, and only the adequate degree of inhibition\u2010\nquenching fury is lacking.(145)\nThe difference between willing and merely wishing, between having ideals\nthat are creative and ideals that are but pinings and regrets, thus\ndepends solely either on the amount of steam\u2010pressure chronically driving\nthe character in the ideal direction, or on the amount of ideal excitement\ntransiently acquired. Given a certain amount of love, indignation,\ngenerosity, magnanimity, admiration, loyalty, or enthusiasm of self\u2010\nsurrender, the result is always the same. That whole raft of cowardly\nobstructions, which in tame persons and dull moods are sovereign\nimpediments to action, sinks away at once. Our conventionality,(146) our\nshyness, laziness, and stinginess, our demands for precedent and\npermission, for guarantee and surety, our small suspicions, timidities,\ndespairs, where are they now? Severed like cobwebs, broken like bubbles in\nthe sun\u2014\n\u201cWo sind die Sorge nun und Noth\nDie mich noch gestern wollt\u2019 erschlaffen?\nIch sch\u00e4m\u2019 mich dess\u2019 im Morgenroth.\u201d\nThe flood we are borne on rolls them so lightly under that their very\ncontact is unfelt. Set free of them, we float and soar and sing. This\nauroral openness and uplift gives to all creative ideal levels a bright\nand caroling quality, which is nowhere more marked than where the\ncontrolling emotion is religious. \u201cThe true monk,\u201d writes an Italian\nmystic, \u201ctakes nothing with him but his lyre.\u201d\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWe may now turn from these psychological generalities to those fruits of\nthe religious state which form the special subject of our present lecture.\nThe man who lives in his religious centre of personal energy, and is\nactuated by spiritual enthusiasms, differs from his previous carnal self\nin perfectly definite ways. The new ardor which burns in his breast\nconsumes in its glow the lower \u201cnoes\u201d which formerly beset him, and keeps\nhim immune against infection from the entire groveling portion of his\nnature. Magnanimities once impossible are now easy; paltry\nconventionalities and mean incentives once tyrannical hold no sway. The\nstone wall inside of him has fallen, the hardness in his heart has broken\ndown. The rest of us can, I think, imagine this by recalling our state of\nfeeling in those temporary \u201cmelting moods\u201d into which either the trials of\nreal life, or the theatre, or a novel sometimes throw us. Especially if we\nweep! For it is then as if our tears broke through an inveterate inner\ndam, and let all sorts of ancient peccancies and moral stagnancies drain\naway, leaving us now washed and soft of heart and open to every nobler\nleading. With most of us the customary hardness quickly returns, but not\nso with saintly persons. Many saints, even as energetic ones as Teresa and\nLoyola, have possessed what the church traditionally reveres as a special\ngrace, the so\u2010called gift of tears. In these persons the melting mood\nseems to have held almost uninterrupted control. And as it is with tears\nand melting moods, so it is with other exalted affections. Their reign may\ncome by gradual growth or by a crisis; but in either case it may have\n\u201ccome to stay.\u201d\nAt the end of the last lecture we saw this permanence to be true of the\ngeneral paramountcy of the higher insight, even though in the ebbs of\nemotional excitement meaner motives might temporarily prevail and\nbacksliding might occur. But that lower temptations may remain completely\nannulled, apart from transient emotion and as if by alteration of the\nman\u2019s habitual nature, is also proved by documentary evidence in certain\ncases. Before embarking on the general natural history of the regenerate\ncharacter, let me convince you of this curious fact by one or two\nexamples. The most numerous are those of reformed drunkards. You recollect\nthe case of Mr. Hadley in the last lecture; the Jerry McAuley Water Street\nMission abounds in similar instances.(147) You also remember the graduate\nof Oxford, converted at three in the afternoon, and getting drunk in the\nhay\u2010field the next day, but after that permanently cured of his appetite.\n\u201cFrom that hour drink has had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never\nwant it. The same thing occurred with my pipe, ... the desire for it went\nat once and has never returned. So with every known sin, the deliverance\nin each case being permanent and complete. I have had no temptations since\nconversion.\u201d\nHere is an analogous case from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection:\u2014\n\u201cI went into the old Adelphi Theatre, where there was a Holiness\nmeeting, ... and I began saying, \u2018Lord, Lord, I must have this\nblessing.\u2019 Then what was to me an audible voice said: \u2018Are you\nwilling to give up everything to the Lord?\u2019 and question after\nquestion kept coming up, to all of which I said: \u2018Yes, Lord; yes,\nLord!\u2019 until this came: \u2018Why do you not accept it _now_?\u2019 and I\nsaid: \u2018I do, Lord.\u2019\u2014I felt no particular joy, only a trust. Just\nthen the meeting closed, and, as I went out on the street, I met a\ngentleman smoking a fine cigar, and a cloud of smoke came into my\nface, and I took a long, deep breath of it, and praise the Lord,\nall my appetite for it was gone. Then as I walked along the\nstreet, passing saloons where the fumes of liquor came out, I\nfound that all my taste and longing for that accursed stuff was\ngone. Glory to God! ... [But] for ten or eleven long years [after\nthat] I was in the wilderness with its ups and downs. My appetite\nfor liquor never came back.\u201d\nThe classic case of Colonel Gardiner is that of a man cured of sexual\ntemptation in a single hour. To Mr. Spears the colonel said, \u201cI was\neffectually cured of all inclination to that sin I was so strongly\naddicted to that I thought nothing but shooting me through the head could\nhave cured me of it; and all desire and inclination to it was removed, as\nentirely as if I had been a sucking child; nor did the temptation return\nto this day.\u201d Mr. Webster\u2019s words on the same subject are these: \u201cOne\nthing I have heard the colonel frequently say, that he was much addicted\nto impurity before his acquaintance with religion; but that, so soon as he\nwas enlightened from above, he felt the power of the Holy Ghost changing\nhis nature so wonderfully that his sanctification in this respect seemed\nmore remarkable than in any other.\u201d(148)\nSuch rapid abolition of ancient impulses and propensities reminds us so\nstrongly of what has been observed as the result of hypnotic suggestion\nthat it is difficult not to believe that subliminal influences play the\ndecisive part in these abrupt changes of heart, just as they do in\nhypnotism.(149) Suggestive therapeutics abound in records of cure, after a\nfew sittings, of inveterate bad habits with which the patient, left to\nordinary moral and physical influences, had struggled in vain. Both\ndrunkenness and sexual vice have been cured in this way, action through\nthe subliminal seeming thus in many individuals to have the prerogative of\ninducing relatively stable change. If the grace of God miraculously\noperates, it probably operates through the subliminal door, then. But just\n_how_ anything operates in this region is still unexplained, and we shall\ndo well now to say good\u2010by to the _process_ of transformation\naltogether,\u2014leaving it, if you like, a good deal of a psychological or\ntheological mystery,\u2014and to turn our attention to the fruits of the\nreligious condition, no matter in what way they may have been\nproduced.(150)\nThe collective name for the ripe fruits of religion in a character is\nSaintliness.(151) The saintly character is the character for which\nspiritual emotions are the habitual centre of the personal energy; and\nthere is a certain composite photograph of universal saintliness, the same\nin all religions, of which the features can easily be traced.(152)\nThey are these:\u2014\n1. A feeling of being in a wider life than that of this world\u2019s selfish\nlittle interests; and a conviction, not merely intellectual, but as it\nwere sensible, of the existence of an Ideal Power. In Christian\nsaintliness this power is always personified as God; but abstract moral\nideals, civic or patriotic utopias, or inner visions of holiness or right\nmay also be felt as the true lords and enlargers of our life, in ways\nwhich I described in the lecture on the Reality of the Unseen.(153)\n2. A sense of the friendly continuity of the ideal power with our own\nlife, and a willing self\u2010surrender to its control.\n3. An immense elation and freedom, as the outlines of the confining\nselfhood melt down.\n4. A shifting of the emotional centre towards loving and harmonious\naffections, towards \u201cyes, yes\u201d and away from \u201cno,\u201d where the claims of the\nnon\u2010ego are concerned.\nThese fundamental inner conditions have characteristic practical\nconsequences, as follows:\u2014\n_a._ _Asceticism._\u2014The self\u2010surrender may become so passionate as to turn\ninto self\u2010immolation. It may then so overrule the ordinary inhibitions of\nthe flesh that the saint finds positive pleasure in sacrifice and\nasceticism, measuring and expressing as they do the degree of his loyalty\nto the higher power.\n_b._ _Strength of Soul._\u2014The sense of enlargement of life may be so\nuplifting that personal motives and inhibitions, commonly omnipotent,\nbecome too insignificant for notice, and new reaches of patience and\nfortitude open out. Fears and anxieties go, and blissful equanimity takes\ntheir place. Come heaven, come hell, it makes no difference now!\n\u201cWe forbid ourselves all seeking after popularity, all ambition to\nappear important. We pledge ourselves to abstain from falsehood,\nin all its degrees. We promise not to create or encourage\nillusions as to what is possible, by what we say or write. We\npromise to one another active sincerity, which strives to see\ntruth clearly, and which never fears to declare what it sees.\n\u201cWe promise deliberate resistance to the tidal waves of fashion,\nto the \u2018booms\u2019 and panics of the public mind, to all the forms of\nweakness and of fear.\n\u201cWe forbid ourselves the use of sarcasm. Of serious things we will\nspeak seriously and unsmilingly, without banter and without the\nappearance of banter;\u2014and even so of all things, for there are\nserious ways of being light of heart.\n\u201cWe will put ourselves forward always for what we are, simply and\nwithout false humility, as well as without pedantry, affectation,\nor pride.\u201d\n_c._ _Purity._\u2014The shifting of the emotional centre brings with it, first,\nincrease of purity. The sensitiveness to spiritual discords is enhanced,\nand the cleansing of existence from brutal and sensual elements becomes\nimperative. Occasions of contact with such elements are avoided: the\nsaintly life must deepen its spiritual consistency and keep unspotted from\nthe world. In some temperaments this need of purity of spirit takes an\nascetic turn, and weaknesses of the flesh are treated with relentless\nseverity.\n_d._ _Charity._\u2014The shifting of the emotional centre brings, secondly,\nincrease of charity, tenderness for fellow\u2010creatures. The ordinary motives\nto antipathy, which usually set such close bounds to tenderness among\nhuman beings, are inhibited. The saint loves his enemies, and treats\nloathsome beggars as his brothers.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI now have to give some concrete illustrations of these fruits of the\nspiritual tree. The only difficulty is to choose, for they are so\nabundant.\nSince the sense of Presence of a higher and friendly Power seems to be the\nfundamental feature in the spiritual life, I will begin with that.\nIn our narratives of conversion we saw how the world might look shining\nand transfigured to the convert,(154) and, apart from anything acutely\nreligious, we all have moments when the universal life seems to wrap us\nround with friendliness. In youth and health, in summer, in the woods or\non the mountains, there come days when the weather seems all whispering\nwith peace, hours when the goodness and beauty of existence enfold us like\na dry warm climate, or chime through us as if our inner ears were subtly\nringing with the world\u2019s security. Thoreau writes:\u2014\n\u201cOnce, a few weeks after I came to the woods, for an hour I\ndoubted whether the near neighborhood of man was not essential to\na serene and healthy life. To be alone was somewhat unpleasant.\nBut, in the midst of a gentle rain, while these thoughts\nprevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent\nsociety in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in\nevery sight and sound around my house, an infinite and\nunaccountable friendliness all at once, like an atmosphere,\nsustaining me, as made the fancied advantages of human\nneighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them\nsince. Every little pine\u2010needle expanded and swelled with sympathy\nand befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware of the presence\nof something kindred to me, that I thought no place could ever be\nstrange to me again.\u201d(155)\nIn the Christian consciousness this sense of the enveloping friendliness\nbecomes most personal and definite. \u201cThe compensation,\u201d writes a German\nauthor, \u201cfor the loss of that sense of personal independence which man so\nunwillingly gives up, is the disappearance of all _fear_ from one\u2019s life,\nthe quite indescribable and inexplicable feeling of an inner _security_,\nwhich one can only experience, but which, once it has been experienced,\none can never forget.\u201d(156)\nI find an excellent description of this state of mind in a sermon by Mr.\nVoysey:\u2014\n\u201cIt is the experience of myriads of trustful souls, that this\nsense of God\u2019s unfailing presence with them in their going out and\nin their coming in, and by night and day, is a source of absolute\nrepose and confident calmness. It drives away all fear of what may\nbefall them. That nearness of God is a constant security against\nterror and anxiety. It is not that they are at all assured of\nphysical safety, or deem themselves protected by a love which is\ndenied to others, but that they are in a state of mind equally\nready to be safe or to meet with injury. If injury befall them,\nthey will be content to bear it because the Lord is their keeper,\nand nothing can befall them without his will. If it be his will,\nthen injury is for them a blessing and no calamity at all. Thus\nand thus only is the trustful man protected and shielded from\nharm. And I for one\u2014by no means a thick\u2010skinned or hard\u2010nerved\nman\u2014am absolutely satisfied with this arrangement, and do not wish\nfor any other kind of immunity from danger and catastrophe. Quite\nas sensitive to pain as the most highly strung organism, I yet\nfeel that the worst of it is conquered, and the sting taken out of\nit altogether, by the thought that God is our loving and sleepless\nkeeper, and that nothing can hurt us without his will.\u201d(157)\nMore excited expressions of this condition are abundant in religious\nliterature. I could easily weary you with their monotony. Here is an\naccount from Mrs. Jonathan Edwards:\u2014\n\u201cLast night,\u201d Mrs. Edwards writes, \u201cwas the sweetest night I ever\nhad in my life. I never before, for so long a time together,\nenjoyed so much of the light and rest and sweetness of heaven in\nmy soul, but without the least agitation of body during the whole\ntime. Part of the night I lay awake, sometimes asleep, and\nsometimes between sleeping and waking. But all night I continued\nin a constant, clear, and lively sense of the heavenly sweetness\nof Christ\u2019s excellent love, of his nearness to me, and of my\ndearness to him; with an inexpressibly sweet calmness of soul in\nan entire rest in him. I seemed to myself to perceive a glow of\ndivine love come down from the heart of Christ in heaven into my\nheart in a constant stream, like a stream or pencil of sweet\nlight. At the same time my heart and soul all flowed out in love\nto Christ, so that there seemed to be a constant flowing and\nreflowing of heavenly love, and I appeared to myself to float or\nswim, in these bright, sweet beams, like the motes swimming in the\nbeams of the sun, or the streams of his light which come in at the\nwindow. I think that what I felt each minute was worth more than\nall the outward comfort and pleasure which I had enjoyed in my\nwhole life put together. It was pleasure, without the least sting,\nor any interruption. It was a sweetness, which my soul was lost\nin; it seemed to be all that my feeble frame could sustain. There\nwas but little difference, whether I was asleep or awake, but if\nthere was any difference, the sweetness was greatest while I was\nasleep.(158) As I awoke early the next morning, it seemed to me\nthat I had entirely done with myself. I felt that the opinions of\nthe world concerning me were nothing, and that I had no more to do\nwith any outward interest of my own than with that of a person\nwhom I never saw. The glory of God seemed to swallow up every wish\nand desire of my heart.... After retiring to rest and sleeping a\nlittle while, I awoke, and was led to reflect on God\u2019s mercy to\nme, in giving me, for many years, a willingness to die; and after\nthat, in making me willing to live, that I might do and suffer\nwhatever he called me to here. I also thought how God had\ngraciously given me an entire resignation to his will, with\nrespect to the kind and manner of death that I should die; having\nbeen made willing to die on the rack, or at the stake, and if it\nwere God\u2019s will, to die in darkness. But now it occurred to me, I\nused to think of living no longer than to the ordinary age of man.\nUpon this I was led to ask myself, whether I was not willing to be\nkept out of heaven even longer; and my whole heart seemed\nimmediately to reply: Yes, a thousand years, and a thousand in\nhorror, if it be most for the honor of God, the torment of my body\nbeing so great, awful, and overwhelming that none could bear to\nlive in the country where the spectacle was seen, and the torment\nof my mind being vastly greater. And it seemed to me that I found\na perfect willingness, quietness, and alacrity of soul in\nconsenting that it should be so, if it were most for the glory of\nGod, so that there was no hesitation, doubt, or darkness in my\nmind. The glory of God seemed to overcome me and swallow me up,\nand every conceivable suffering, and everything that was terrible\nto my nature, seemed to shrink to nothing before it. This\nresignation continued in its clearness and brightness the rest of\nthe night, and all the next day, and the night following, and on\nMonday in the forenoon, without interruption or abatement.\u201d(159)\nThe annals of Catholic saintship abound in records as ecstatic or more\necstatic than this. \u201cOften the assaults of the divine love,\u201d it is said of\nthe Sister S\u00e9raphique de la Martini\u00e8re, \u201creduced her almost to the point\nof death. She used tenderly to complain of this to God. \u2018I cannot support\nit,\u2019 she used to say. \u2018Bear gently with my weakness, or I shall expire\nunder the violence of your love.\u2019 \u201d(160)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLet me pass next to the Charity and Brotherly Love which are a usual fruit\nof saintliness, and have always been reckoned essential theological\nvirtues, however limited may have been the kinds of service which the\nparticular theology enjoined. Brotherly love would follow logically from\nthe assurance of God\u2019s friendly presence, the notion of our brotherhood as\nmen being an immediate inference from that of God\u2019s fatherhood of us all.\nWhen Christ utters the precepts: \u201cLove your enemies, bless them that curse\nyou, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully\nuse you, and persecute you,\u201d he gives for a reason: \u201cThat ye may be the\nchildren of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise\non the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the\nunjust.\u201d One might therefore be tempted to explain both the humility as to\none\u2019s self and the charity towards others which characterize spiritual\nexcitement, as results of the all\u2010leveling character of theistic belief.\nBut these affections are certainly not mere derivatives of theism. We find\nthem in Stoicism, in Hinduism, and in Buddhism in the highest possible\ndegree. They harmonize with paternal theism beautifully; but they\n_harmonize_ with all reflection whatever upon the dependence of mankind on\ngeneral causes; and we must, I think, consider them not subordinate but\nco\u00f6rdinate parts of that great complex excitement in the study of which we\nare engaged. Religious rapture, moral enthusiasm, ontological wonder,\ncosmic emotion, are all unifying states of mind, in which the sand and\ngrit of the selfhood incline to disappear, and tenderness to rule. The\nbest thing is to describe the condition integrally as a characteristic\naffection to which our nature is liable, a region in which we find\nourselves at home, a sea in which we swim; but not to pretend to explain\nits parts by deriving them too cleverly from one another. Like love or\nfear, the faith\u2010state is a natural psychic complex, and carries charity\nwith it by organic consequence. Jubilation is an expansive affection, and\nall expansive affections are self\u2010forgetful and kindly so long as they\nendure.\nWe find this the case even when they are pathological in origin. In his\ninstructive work, la Tristesse et la Joie,(161) M. Georges Dumas compares\ntogether the melancholy and the joyous phase of circular insanity, and\nshows that, while selfishness characterizes the one, the other is marked\nby altruistic impulses. No human being so stingy and useless as was Marie\nin her melancholy period! But the moment the happy period begins,\n\u201csympathy and kindness become her characteristic sentiments. She displays\na universal goodwill, not only of intention, but in act.... She becomes\nsolicitous of the health of other patients, interested in getting them\nout, desirous to procure wool to knit socks for some of them. Never since\nshe has been under my observation have I heard her in her joyous period\nutter any but charitable opinions.\u201d(162) And later, Dr. Dumas says of all\nsuch joyous conditions that \u201cunselfish sentiments and tender emotions are\nthe only affective states to be found in them. The subject\u2019s mind is\nclosed against envy, hatred, and vindictiveness, and wholly transformed\ninto benevolence, indulgence, and mercy.\u201d(163)\nThere is thus an organic affinity between joyousness and tenderness, and\ntheir companionship in the saintly life need in no way occasion surprise.\nAlong with the happiness, this increase of tenderness is often noted in\nnarratives of conversion. \u201cI began to work for others\u201d;\u2014\u201cI had more tender\nfeeling for my family and friends\u201d;\u2014\u201cI spoke at once to a person with whom\nI had been angry\u201d;\u2014\u201cI felt for every one, and loved my friends better\u201d;\u2014\u201cI\nfelt every one to be my friend\u201d;\u2014these are so many expressions from the\nrecords collected by Professor Starbuck.(164)\n\u201cWhen,\u201d says Mrs. Edwards, continuing the narrative from which I\nmade quotation a moment ago, \u201cI arose on the morning of the\nSabbath, I felt a love to all mankind, wholly peculiar in its\nstrength and sweetness, far beyond all that I had ever felt\nbefore. The power of that love seemed inexpressible. I thought, if\nI were surrounded by enemies, who were venting their malice and\ncruelty upon me, in tormenting me, it would still be impossible\nthat I should cherish any feelings towards them but those of love,\nand pity, and ardent desires for their happiness. I never before\nfelt so far from a disposition to judge and censure others, as I\ndid that morning. I realized also, in an unusual and very lively\nmanner, how great a part of Christianity lies in the performance\nof our social and relative duties to one another. The same joyful\nsense continued throughout the day\u2014a sweet love to God and all\nmankind.\u201d\nWhatever be the explanation of the charity, it may efface all usual human\nbarriers.(165)\nHere, for instance, is an example of Christian non\u2010resistance from Richard\nWeaver\u2019s autobiography. Weaver was a collier, a semi\u2010professional pugilist\nin his younger days, who became a much beloved evangelist. Fighting, after\ndrinking, seems to have been the sin to which he originally felt his flesh\nmost perversely inclined. After his first conversion he had a backsliding,\nwhich consisted in pounding a man who had insulted a girl. Feeling that,\nhaving once fallen, he might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb,\nhe got drunk and went and broke the jaw of another man who had lately\nchallenged him to fight and taunted him with cowardice for refusing as a\nChristian man;\u2014I mention these incidents to show how genuine a change of\nheart is implied in the later conduct which he describes as follows:\u2014\n\u201cI went down the drift and found the boy crying because a fellow\u2010\nworkman was trying to take the wagon from him by force. I said to\nhim:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018Tom, you mustn\u2019t take that wagon.\u2019\n\u201cHe swore at me, and called me a Methodist devil. I told him that\nGod did not tell me to let him rob me. He cursed again, and said\nhe would push the wagon over me.\n\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018let us see whether the devil and thee are\nstronger than the Lord and me.\u2019\n\u201cAnd the Lord and I proving stronger than the devil and he, he had\nto get out of the way, or the wagon would have gone over him. So I\ngave the wagon to the boy. Then said Tom:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019ve a good mind to smack thee on the face.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018if that will do thee any good, thou canst do\nit.\u2019 So he struck me on the face.\n\u201cI turned the other cheek to him, and said, \u2018Strike again.\u2019\n\u201cHe struck again and again, till he had struck me five times. I\nturned my cheek for the sixth stroke; but he turned away cursing.\nI shouted after him: \u2018The Lord forgive thee, for I do, and the\nLord save thee.\u2019\n\u201cThis was on a Saturday; and when I went home from the coal\u2010pit my\nwife saw my face was swollen, and asked what was the matter with\nit. I said: \u2018I\u2019ve been fighting, and I\u2019ve given a man a good\nthrashing.\u2019\n\u201cShe burst out weeping, and said, \u2018O Richard, what made you\nfight?\u2019 Then I told her all about it; and she thanked the Lord I\nhad not struck back.\n\u201cBut the Lord had struck, and his blows have more effect than\nman\u2019s. Monday came. The devil began to tempt me, saying: \u2018The\nother men will laugh at thee for allowing Tom to treat thee as he\ndid on Saturday.\u2019 I cried, \u2018Get thee behind me, Satan;\u2019\u2014and went\non my way to the coal\u2010pit.\n\u201cTom was the first man I saw. I said \u2018Good\u2010morning,\u2019 but got no\nreply.\n\u201cHe went down first. When I got down, I was surprised to see him\nsitting on the wagon\u2010road waiting for me. When I came to him he\nburst into tears and said: \u2018Richard, will you forgive me for\nstriking you?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I have forgiven thee,\u2019 said I; \u2018ask God to forgive thee. The\nLord bless thee.\u2019 I gave him my hand, and we went each to his\nwork.\u201d(166)\n\u201cLove your enemies!\u201d Mark you, not simply those who happen not to be your\nfriends, but your _enemies_, your positive and active enemies. Either this\nis a mere Oriental hyperbole, a bit of verbal extravagance, meaning only\nthat we should, as far as we can, abate our animosities, or else it is\nsincere and literal. Outside of certain cases of intimate individual\nrelation, it seldom has been taken literally. Yet it makes one ask the\nquestion: Can there in general be a level of emotion so unifying, so\nobliterative of differences between man and man, that even enmity may come\nto be an irrelevant circumstance and fail to inhibit the friendlier\ninterests aroused? If positive well\u2010wishing could attain so supreme a\ndegree of excitement, those who were swayed by it might well seem\nsuperhuman beings. Their life would be morally discrete from the life of\nother men, and there is no saying, in the absence of positive experience\nof an authentic kind,\u2014for there are few active examples in our scriptures,\nand the Buddhistic examples are legendary,(167)\u2014what the effects might be:\nthey might conceivably transform the world.\nPsychologically and in principle, the precept \u201cLove your enemies\u201d is not\nself\u2010contradictory. It is merely the extreme limit of a kind of\nmagnanimity with which, in the shape of pitying tolerance of our\noppressors, we are fairly familiar. Yet if radically followed, it would\ninvolve such a breach with our instinctive springs of action as a whole,\nand with the present world\u2019s arrangements, that a critical point would\npractically be passed, and we should be born into another kingdom of\nbeing. Religious emotion makes us feel that other kingdom to be close at\nhand, within our reach.\nThe inhibition of instinctive repugnance is proved not only by the showing\nof love to enemies, but by the showing of it to any one who is personally\nloathsome. In the annals of saintliness we find a curious mixture of\nmotives impelling in this direction. Asceticism plays its part; and along\nwith charity pure and simple, we find humility or the desire to disclaim\ndistinction and to grovel on the common level before God. Certainly all\nthree principles were at work when Francis of Assisi and Ignatius Loyola\nexchanged their garments with those of filthy beggars. All three are at\nwork when religious persons consecrate their lives to the care of leprosy\nor other peculiarly unpleasant diseases. The nursing of the sick is a\nfunction to which the religious seem strongly drawn, even apart from the\nfact that church traditions set that way. But in the annals of this sort\nof charity we find fantastic excesses of devotion recorded which are only\nexplicable by the frenzy of self\u2010immolation simultaneously aroused.\nFrancis of Assisi kisses his lepers; Margaret Mary Alacoque, Francis\nXavier, St. John of God, and others are said to have cleansed the sores\nand ulcers of their patients with their respective tongues; and the lives\nof such saints as Elizabeth of Hungary and Madame de Chantal are full of a\nsort of reveling in hospital purulence, disagreeable to read of, and which\nmakes us admire and shudder at the same time.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nSo much for the human love aroused by the faith\u2010state. Let me next speak\nof the Equanimity, Resignation, Fortitude, and Patience which it brings.\n\u201cA paradise of inward tranquillity\u201d seems to be faith\u2019s usual result; and\nit is easy, even without being religious one\u2019s self, to understand this. A\nmoment back, in treating of the sense of God\u2019s presence, I spoke of the\nunaccountable feeling of safety which one may then have. And, indeed, how\ncan it possibly fail to steady the nerves, to cool the fever, and appease\nthe fret, if one be sensibly conscious that, no matter what one\u2019s\ndifficulties for the moment may appear to be, one\u2019s life as a whole is in\nthe keeping of a power whom one can absolutely trust? In deeply religious\nmen the abandonment of self to this power is passionate. Whoever not only\nsays, but _feels_, \u201cGod\u2019s will be done,\u201d is mailed against every weakness;\nand the whole historic array of martyrs, missionaries, and religious\nreformers is there to prove the tranquil\u2010mindedness, under naturally\nagitating or distressing circumstances, which self\u2010surrender brings.\nThe temper of the tranquil\u2010mindedness differs, of course, according as the\nperson is of a constitutionally sombre or of a constitutionally cheerful\ncast of mind. In the sombre it partakes more of resignation and\nsubmission; in the cheerful it is a joyous consent. As an example of the\nformer temper, I quote part of a letter from Professor Lagneau, a\nvenerated teacher of philosophy who lately died, a great invalid, at\nParis:\u2014\n\u201cMy life, for the success of which you send good wishes, will be\nwhat it is able to be. I ask nothing from it, I expect nothing\nfrom it. For long years now I exist, think, and act, and am worth\nwhat I am worth, only through the despair which is my sole\nstrength and my sole foundation. May it preserve for me, even in\nthese last trials to which I am coming, the courage to do without\nthe desire of deliverance. I ask nothing more from the Source\nwhence all strength cometh, and if that is granted, your wishes\nwill have been accomplished.\u201d(168)\nThere is something pathetic and fatalistic about this, but the power of\nsuch a tone as a protection against outward shocks is manifest. Pascal is\nanother Frenchman of pessimistic natural temperament. He expresses still\nmore amply the temper of self\u2010surrendering submissiveness:\u2014\n\u201cDeliver me, Lord,\u201d he writes in his prayers, \u201cfrom the sadness at\nmy proper suffering which self\u2010love might give, but put into me a\nsadness like your own. Let my sufferings appease your choler. Make\nthem an occasion for my conversion and salvation. I ask you\nneither for health nor for sickness, for life nor for death; but\nthat you may dispose of my health and my sickness, my life and my\ndeath, for your glory, for my salvation, and for the use of the\nChurch and of your saints, of whom I would by your grace be one.\nYou alone know what is expedient for me; you are the sovereign\nmaster; do with me according to your will. Give to me, or take\naway from me, only conform my will to yours. I know but one thing,\nLord, that it is good to follow you, and bad to offend you. Apart\nfrom that, I know not what is good or bad in anything. I know not\nwhich is most profitable to me, health or sickness, wealth or\npoverty, nor anything else in the world. That discernment is\nbeyond the power of men or angels, and is hidden among the secrets\nof your Providence, which I adore, but do not seek to\nfathom.\u201d(169)\nWhen we reach more optimistic temperaments, the resignation grows less\npassive. Examples are sown so broadcast throughout history that I might\nwell pass on without citation. As it is, I snatch at the first that occurs\nto my mind. Madame Guyon, a frail creature physically, was yet of a happy\nnative disposition. She went through many perils with admirable serenity\nof soul. After being sent to prison for heresy,\u2014\n\u201cSome of my friends,\u201d she writes, \u201cwept bitterly at the hearing of\nit, but such was my state of acquiescence and resignation that it\nfailed to draw any tears from me.... There appeared to be in me\nthen, as I find it to be in me now, such an entire loss of what\nregards myself, that any of my own interests gave me little pain\nor pleasure; ever wanting to will or wish for myself only the very\nthing which God does.\u201d In another place she writes: \u201cWe all of us\ncame near perishing in a river which we found it necessary to\npass. The carriage sank in the quicksand. Others who were with us\nthrew themselves out in excessive fright. But I found my thoughts\nso much taken up with God that I had no distinct sense of danger.\nIt is true that the thought of being drowned passed across my\nmind, but it cost no other sensation or reflection in me than\nthis\u2014that I felt quite contented and willing it were so, if it\nwere my heavenly Father\u2019s choice.\u201d Sailing from Nice to Genoa, a\nstorm keeps her eleven days at sea. \u201cAs the irritated waves dashed\nround us,\u201d she writes, \u201cI could not help experiencing a certain\ndegree of satisfaction in my mind. I pleased myself with thinking\nthat those mutinous billows, under the command of Him who does all\nthings rightly, might probably furnish me with a watery grave.\nPerhaps I carried the point too far, in the pleasure which I took\nin thus seeing myself beaten and bandied by the swelling waters.\nThose who were with me took notice of my intrepidity.\u201d(170)\nThe contempt of danger which religious enthusiasm produces may be even\nmore buoyant still. I take an example from that charming recent\nautobiography, \u201cWith Christ at Sea,\u201d by Frank Bullen. A couple of days\nafter he went through the conversion on shipboard of which he there gives\nan account,\u2014\n\u201cIt was blowing stiffly,\u201d he writes, \u201cand we were carrying a press\nof canvas to get north out of the bad weather. Shortly after four\nbells we hauled down the flying\u2010jib, and I sprang out astride the\nboom to furl it. I was sitting astride the boom when suddenly it\ngave way with me. The sail slipped through my fingers, and I fell\nbackwards, hanging head downwards over the seething tumult of\nshining foam under the ship\u2019s bows, suspended by one foot. But I\nfelt only high exultation in my certainty of eternal life.\nAlthough death was divided from me by a hair\u2019s breadth, and I was\nacutely conscious of the fact, it gave me no sensation but joy. I\nsuppose I could have hung there no longer than five seconds, but\nin that time I lived a whole age of delight. But my body asserted\nitself, and with a desperate gymnastic effort I regained the boom.\nHow I furled the sail I don\u2019t know, but I sang at the utmost pitch\nof my voice praises to God that went pealing out over the dark\nwaste of waters.\u201d(171)\nThe annals of martyrdom are of course the signal field of triumph for\nreligious imperturbability. Let me cite as an example the statement of a\nhumble sufferer, persecuted as a Huguenot under Louis XIV.:\u2014\n\u201cThey shut all the doors,\u201d Blanche Gamond writes, \u201cand I saw six\nwomen, each with a bunch of willow rods as thick as the hand could\nhold, and a yard long. He gave me the order, \u2018Undress yourself,\u2019\nwhich I did. He said, \u2018You are leaving on your shift; you must\ntake it off.\u2019 They had so little patience that they took it off\nthemselves, and I was naked from the waist up. They brought a cord\nwith which they tied me to a beam in the kitchen. They drew the\ncord tight with all their strength and asked me, \u2018Does it hurt\nyou?\u2019 and then they discharged their fury upon me, exclaiming as\nthey struck me, \u2018Pray now to your God.\u2019 It was the Roulette woman\nwho held this language. But at this moment I received the greatest\nconsolation that I can ever receive in my life, since I had the\nhonor of being whipped for the name of Christ, and in addition of\nbeing crowned with his mercy and his consolations. Why can I not\nwrite down the inconceivable influences, consolations, and peace\nwhich I felt interiorly? To understand them one must have passed\nby the same trial; they were so great that I was ravished, for\nthere where afflictions abound grace is given superabundantly. In\nvain the women cried, \u2018We must double our blows; she does not feel\nthem, for she neither speaks nor cries.\u2019 And how should I have\ncried, since I was swooning with happiness within?\u201d(172)\nThe transition from tenseness, self\u2010responsibility, and worry, to\nequanimity, receptivity, and peace, is the most wonderful of all those\nshiftings of inner equilibrium, those changes of the personal centre of\nenergy, which I have analyzed so often; and the chief wonder of it is that\nit so often comes about, not by doing, but by simply relaxing and throwing\nthe burden down. This abandonment of self\u2010responsibility seems to be the\nfundamental act in specifically religious, as distinguished from moral\npractice. It antedates theologies and is independent of philosophies.\nMind\u2010cure, theosophy, stoicism, ordinary neurological hygiene, insist on\nit as emphatically as Christianity does, and it is capable of entering\ninto closest marriage with every speculative creed.(173) Christians who\nhave it strongly live in what is called \u201crecollection,\u201d and are never\nanxious about the future, nor worry over the outcome of the day. Of Saint\nCatharine of Genoa it is said that \u201cshe took cognizance of things, only as\nthey were presented to her in succession, _moment by moment_.\u201d To her holy\nsoul, \u201cthe divine moment was the present moment,... and when the present\nmoment was estimated in itself and in its relations, and when the duty\nthat was involved in it was accomplished, it was permitted to pass away as\nif it had never been, and to give way to the facts and duties of the\nmoment which came after.\u201d(174)\nHinduism, mind\u2010cure, and theosophy all lay great emphasis upon this\nconcentration of the consciousness upon the moment at hand.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next religious symptom which I will note is what I have called Purity\nof Life. The saintly person becomes exceedingly sensitive to inner\ninconsistency or discord, and mixture and confusion grow intolerable. All\nthe mind\u2019s objects and occupations must be ordered with reference to the\nspecial spiritual excitement which is now its keynote. Whatever is\nunspiritual taints the pure water of the soul and is repugnant. Mixed with\nthis exaltation of the moral sensibilities there is also an ardor of\nsacrifice, for the beloved deity\u2019s sake, of everything unworthy of him.\nSometimes the spiritual ardor is so sovereign that purity is achieved at a\nstroke\u2014we have seen examples. Usually it is a more gradual conquest. Billy\nBray\u2019s account of his abandonment of tobacco is a good example of the\nlatter form of achievement.\n\u201cI had been a smoker as well as a drunkard, and I used to love my\ntobacco as much as I loved my meat, and I would rather go down\ninto the mine without my dinner than without my pipe. In the days\nof old, the Lord spoke by the mouths of his servants, the\nprophets; now he speaks to us by the spirit of his Son. I had not\nonly the feeling part of religion, but I could hear the small,\nstill voice within speaking to me. When I took the pipe to smoke,\nit would be applied within, \u2018It is an idol, a lust; worship the\nLord with clean lips.\u2019 So, I felt it was not right to smoke. The\nLord also sent a woman to convince me. I was one day in a house,\nand I took out my pipe to light it at the fire, and Mary Hawke\u2014for\nthat was the woman\u2019s name\u2014said, \u2018Do you not feel it is wrong to\nsmoke?\u2019 I said that I felt something inside telling me that it was\nan idol, a lust, and she said that was the Lord. Then I said,\n\u2018Now, I must give it up, for the Lord is telling me of it inside,\nand the woman outside, so the tobacco must go, love it as I may.\u2019\nThere and then I took the tobacco out of my pocket, and threw it\ninto the fire, and put the pipe under my foot, \u2018ashes to ashes,\ndust to dust.\u2019 And I have not smoked since. I found it hard to\nbreak off old habits, but I cried to the Lord for help, and he\ngave me strength, for he has said, \u2018Call upon me in the day of\ntrouble, and I will deliver thee.\u2019 The day after I gave up smoking\nI had the toothache so bad that I did not know what to do. I\nthought this was owing to giving up the pipe, but I said I would\nnever smoke again, if I lost every tooth in my head. I said,\n\u2018Lord, thou hast told us My yoke is easy and my burden is light,\u2019\nand when I said that, all the pain left me. Sometimes the thought\nof the pipe would come back to me very strong; but the Lord\nstrengthened me against the habit, and, bless his name, I have not\nsmoked since.\u201d\nBray\u2019s biographer writes that after he had given up smoking, he\nthought that he would chew a little, but he conquered this dirty\nhabit, too. \u201cOn one occasion,\u201d Bray said, \u201cwhen at a prayer\u2010\nmeeting at Hicks Mill, I heard the Lord say to me, \u2018Worship me\nwith clean lips.\u2019 So, when we got up from our knees, I took the\nquid out of my mouth and \u2018whipped \u2019en\u2019 [threw it] under the form.\nBut, when we got on our knees again, I put another quid into my\nmouth. Then the Lord said to me again, \u2018Worship me with clean\nlips.\u2019 So I took the quid out of my mouth, and whipped \u2019en under\nthe form again, and said, \u2018Yes, Lord, I will.\u2019 From that time I\ngave up chewing as well as smoking, and have been a free man.\u201d\nThe ascetic forms which the impulse for veracity and purity of life may\ntake are often pathetic enough. The early Quakers, for example, had hard\nbattles to wage against the worldliness and insincerity of the\necclesiastical Christianity of their time. Yet the battle that cost them\nmost wounds was probably that which they fought in defense of their own\nright to social veracity and sincerity in their thee\u2010ing and thou\u2010ing, in\nnot doffing the hat or giving titles of respect. It was laid on George Fox\nthat these conventional customs were a lie and a sham, and the whole body\nof his followers thereupon renounced them, as a sacrifice to truth, and so\nthat their acts and the spirit they professed might be more in accord.\n\u201cWhen the Lord sent me into the world,\u201d says Fox in his Journal,\n\u201che forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low: and I was\nrequired to \u2018thee\u2019 and \u2018thou\u2019 all men and women, without any\nrespect to rich or poor, great or small. And as I traveled up and\ndown, I was not to bid people Good\u2010morning, or Good\u2010evening,\nneither might I bow or scrape with my leg to any one. This made\nthe sects and professions rage. Oh! the rage that was in the\npriests, magistrates, professors, and people of all sorts: and\nespecially in priests and professors: for though \u2018thou\u2019 to a\nsingle person was according to their accidence and grammar rules,\nand according to the Bible, yet they could not bear to hear it:\nand because I could not put off my hat to them, it set them all\ninto a rage.... Oh! the scorn, heat, and fury that arose! Oh! the\nblows, punchings, beatings, and imprisonments that we underwent\nfor not putting off our hats to men! Some had their hats violently\nplucked off and thrown away, so that they quite lost them. The bad\nlanguage and evil usage we received on this account is hard to be\nexpressed, besides the danger we were sometimes in of losing our\nlives for this matter, and that by the great professors of\nChristianity, who thereby discovered they were not true believers.\nAnd though it was but a small thing in the eye of man, yet a\nwonderful confusion it brought among all professors and priests:\nbut, blessed be the Lord, many came to see the vanity of that\ncustom of putting off hats to men, and felt the weight of Truth\u2019s\ntestimony against it.\u201d\nIn the autobiography of Thomas Elwood, an early Quaker, who at one time\nwas secretary to John Milton, we find an exquisitely quaint and candid\naccount of the trials he underwent both at home and abroad, in following\nFox\u2019s canons of sincerity. The anecdotes are too lengthy for citation; but\nElwood sets down his manner of feeling about these things in a shorter\npassage, which I will quote as a characteristic utterance of spiritual\nsensibility:\u2014\n\u201cBy this divine light, then,\u201d says Elwood, \u201cI saw that though I\nhad not the evil of the common uncleanliness, debauchery,\nprofaneness, and pollutions of the world to put away, because I\nhad, through the great goodness of God and a civil education, been\npreserved out of those grosser evils, yet I had many other evils\nto put away and to cease from; some of which were not by the\nworld, which lies in wickedness (1 John v. 19), accounted evils,\nbut by the light of Christ were made manifest to me to be evils,\nand as such condemned in me.\n\u201cAs particularly those fruits and effects of pride that discover\nthemselves in the vanity and superfluity of apparel; which I took\ntoo much delight in. This evil of my doings I was required to put\naway and cease from; and judgment lay upon me till I did so.\n\u201cI took off from my apparel those unnecessary trimmings of lace,\nribbons, and useless buttons, which had no real service, but were\nset on only for that which was by mistake called ornament; and I\nceased to wear rings.\n\u201cAgain, the giving of flattering titles to men between whom and me\nthere was not any relation to which such titles could be pretended\nto belong. This was an evil I had been much addicted to, and was\naccounted a ready artist in; therefore this evil also was I\nrequired to put away and cease from. So that thenceforward I durst\nnot say, Sir, Master, My Lord, Madam (or My Dame); or say Your\nServant to any one to whom I did not stand in the real relation of\na servant, which I had never done to any.\n\u201cAgain, respect of persons, in uncovering the head and bowing the\nknee or body in salutation, was a practice I had been much in the\nuse of; and this, being one of the vain customs of the world,\nintroduced by the spirit of the world, instead of the true honor\nwhich this is a false representation of, and used in deceit as a\ntoken of respect by persons one to another, who bear no real\nrespect one to another; and besides this, being a type and a\nproper emblem of that divine honor which all ought to pay to\nAlmighty God, and which all of all sorts, who take upon them the\nChristian name, appear in when they offer their prayers to him,\nand therefore should not be given to men;\u2014I found this to be one\nof those evils which I had been too long doing; therefore I was\nnow required to put it away and cease from it.\n\u201cAgain, the corrupt and unsound form of speaking in the plural\nnumber to a single person, _you_ to one, instead of _thou_,\ncontrary to the pure, plain, and single language of truth, _thou_\nto one, and _you_ to more than one, which had always been used by\nGod to men, and men to God, as well as one to another, from the\noldest record of time till corrupt men, for corrupt ends, in later\nand corrupt times, to flatter, fawn, and work upon the corrupt\nnature in men, brought in that false and senseless way of speaking\n_you_ to one, which has since corrupted the modern languages, and\nhath greatly debased the spirits and depraved the manners of\nmen;\u2014this evil custom I had been as forward in as others, and this\nI was now called out of and required to cease from.\n\u201cThese and many more evil customs which had sprung up in the night\nof darkness and general apostasy from the truth and true religion\nwere now, by the inshining of this pure ray of divine light in my\nconscience, gradually discovered to me to be what I ought to cease\nfrom, shun, and stand a witness against.\u201d(175)\nThese early Quakers were Puritans indeed. The slightest inconsistency\nbetween profession and deed jarred some of them to active protest. John\nWoolman writes in his diary:\u2014\n\u201cIn these journeys I have been where much cloth hath been dyed;\nand have at sundry times walked over ground where much of their\ndyestuffs has drained away. This hath produced a longing in my\nmind that people might come into cleanness of spirit, cleanness of\nperson, and cleanness about their houses and garments. Dyes being\ninvented partly to please the eye, and partly to hide dirt, I have\nfelt in this weak state, when traveling in dirtiness, and affected\nwith unwholesome scents, a strong desire that the nature of dyeing\ncloth to hide dirt may be more fully considered.\n\u201cWashing our garments to keep them sweet is cleanly, but it is the\nopposite to real cleanliness to hide dirt in them. Through giving\nway to hiding dirt in our garments a spirit which would conceal\nthat which is disagreeable is strengthened. Real cleanliness\nbecometh a holy people; but hiding that which is not clean by\ncoloring our garments seems contrary to the sweetness of\nsincerity. Through some sorts of dyes cloth is rendered less\nuseful. And if the value of dyestuffs, and expense of dyeing, and\nthe damage done to cloth, were all added together, and that cost\napplied to keeping all sweet and clean, how much more would real\ncleanliness prevail.\n\u201cThinking often on these things, the use of hats and garments dyed\nwith a dye hurtful to them, and wearing more clothes in summer\nthan are useful, grew more uneasy to me; believing them to be\ncustoms which have not their foundation in pure wisdom. The\napprehension of being singular from my beloved friends was a\nstrait upon me; and thus I continued in the use of some things,\ncontrary to my judgment, about nine months. Then I thought of\ngetting a hat the natural color of the fur, but the apprehension\nof being looked upon as one affecting singularity felt uneasy to\nme. On this account I was under close exercise of mind in the time\nof our general spring meeting in 1762, greatly desiring to be\nrightly directed; when, being deeply bowed in spirit before the\nLord, I was made willing to submit to what I apprehended was\nrequired of me; and when I returned home, got a hat of the natural\ncolor of the fur.\n\u201cIn attending meetings, this singularity was a trial to me, and\nmore especially at this time, as white hats were used by some who\nwere fond of following the changeable modes of dress, and as some\nfriends, who knew not from what motives I wore it, grew shy of me,\nI felt my way for a time shut up in the exercise of the ministry.\nSome friends were apprehensive that my wearing such a hat savored\nof an affected singularity: those who spoke with me in a friendly\nway, I generally informed in a few words, that I believed my\nwearing it was not in my own will.\u201d\nWhen the craving for moral consistency and purity is developed to this\ndegree, the subject may well find the outer world too full of shocks to\ndwell in, and can unify his life and keep his soul unspotted only by\nwithdrawing from it. That law which impels the artist to achieve harmony\nin his composition by simply dropping out whatever jars, or suggests a\ndiscord, rules also in the spiritual life. To omit, says Stevenson, is the\none art in literature: \u201cIf I knew how to omit, I should ask no other\nknowledge.\u201d And life, when full of disorder and slackness and vague\nsuperfluity, can no more have what we call character than literature can\nhave it under similar conditions. So monasteries and communities of\nsympathetic devotees open their doors, and in their changeless order,\ncharacterized by omissions quite as much as constituted of actions, the\nholy\u2010minded person finds that inner smoothness and cleanness which it is\ntorture to him to feel violated at every turn by the discordancy and\nbrutality of secular existence.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThat the scrupulosity of purity may be carried to a fantastic extreme must\nbe admitted. In this it resembles Asceticism, to which further symptom of\nsaintliness we had better turn next. The adjective \u201cascetic\u201d is applied to\nconduct originating on diverse psychological levels, which I might as well\nbegin by distinguishing from one another.\n1. Asceticism may be a mere expression of organic hardihood,\ndisgusted with too much ease.\n2. Temperance in meat and drink, simplicity of apparel, chastity,\nand non\u2010pampering of the body generally, may be fruits of the love\nof purity, shocked by whatever savors of the sensual.\n3. They may also be fruits of love, that is, they may appeal to\nthe subject in the light of sacrifices which he is happy in making\nto the Deity whom he acknowledges.\n4. Again, ascetic mortifications and torments may be due to\npessimistic feelings about the self, combined with theological\nbeliefs concerning expiation. The devotee may feel that he is\nbuying himself free, or escaping worse sufferings hereafter, by\ndoing penance now.\n5. In psychopathic persons, mortifications may be entered on\nirrationally, by a sort of obsession or fixed idea which comes as\na challenge and must be worked off, because only thus does the\nsubject get his interior consciousness feeling right again.\n6. Finally, ascetic exercises may in rarer instances be prompted\nby genuine perversions of the bodily sensibility, in consequence\nof which normally pain\u2010giving stimuli are actually felt as\npleasures.\nI will try to give an instance under each of these heads in turn; but it\nis not easy to get them pure, for in cases pronounced enough to be\nimmediately classed as ascetic, several of the assigned motives usually\nwork together. Moreover, before citing any examples at all, I must invite\nyou to some general psychological considerations which apply to all of\nthem alike.\nA strange moral transformation has within the past century swept over our\nWestern world. We no longer think that we are called on to face physical\npain with equanimity. It is not expected of a man that he should either\nendure it or inflict much of it, and to listen to the recital of cases of\nit makes our flesh creep morally as well as physically. The way in which\nour ancestors looked upon pain as an eternal ingredient of the world\u2019s\norder, and both caused and suffered it as a matter\u2010of\u2010course portion of\ntheir day\u2019s work, fills us with amazement. We wonder that any human beings\ncould have been so callous. The result of this historic alteration is that\neven in the Mother Church herself, where ascetic discipline has such a\nfixed traditional prestige as a factor of merit, it has largely come into\ndesuetude, if not discredit. A believer who flagellates or \u201cmacerates\u201d\nhimself to\u2010day arouses more wonder and fear than emulation. Many Catholic\nwriters who admit that the times have changed in this respect do so\nresignedly; and even add that perhaps it is as well not to waste feelings\nin regretting the matter, for to return to the heroic corporeal discipline\nof ancient days might be an extravagance.\nWhere to seek the easy and the pleasant seems instinctive\u2014and instinctive\nit appears to be in man; any deliberate tendency to pursue the hard and\npainful as such and for their own sakes might well strike one as purely\nabnormal. Nevertheless, in moderate degrees it is natural and even usual\nto human nature to court the arduous. It is only the extreme\nmanifestations of the tendency that can be regarded as a paradox.\nThe psychological reasons for this lie near the surface. When we drop\nabstractions and take what we call our will in the act, we see that it is\na very complex function. It involves both stimulations and inhibitions; it\nfollows generalized habits; it is escorted by reflective criticisms; and\nit leaves a good or a bad taste of itself behind, according to the manner\nof the performance. The result is that, quite apart from the immediate\npleasure which any sensible experience may give us, our own general moral\nattitude in procuring or undergoing the experience brings with it a\nsecondary satisfaction or distaste. Some men and women, indeed, there are\nwho can live on smiles and the word \u201cyes\u201d forever. But for others (indeed\nfor most), this is too tepid and relaxed a moral climate. Passive\nhappiness is slack and insipid, and soon grows mawkish and intolerable.\nSome austerity and wintry negativity, some roughness, danger, stringency,\nand effort, some \u201cno! no!\u201d must be mixed in, to produce the sense of an\nexistence with character and texture and power. The range of individual\ndifferences in this respect is enormous; but whatever the mixture of yeses\nand noes may be, the person is infallibly aware when he has struck it in\nthe right proportion _for him_. This, he feels, is my proper vocation,\nthis is the _optimum_, the law, the life for me to live. Here I find the\ndegree of equilibrium, safety, calm, and leisure which I need, or here I\nfind the challenge, passion, fight, and hardship without which my soul\u2019s\nenergy expires.\nEvery individual soul, in short, like every individual machine or\norganism, has its own best conditions of efficiency. A given machine will\nrun best under a certain steam\u2010pressure, a certain amperage; an organism\nunder a certain diet, weight, or exercise. You seem to do best, I heard a\ndoctor say to a patient, at about 140 millimeters of arterial tension. And\nit is just so with our sundry souls: some are happiest in calm weather;\nsome need the sense of tension, of strong volition, to make them feel\nalive and well. For these latter souls, whatever is gained from day to day\nmust be paid for by sacrifice and inhibition, or else it comes too cheap\nand has no zest.\nNow when characters of this latter sort become religious, they are apt to\nturn the edge of their need of effort and negativity against their natural\nself; and the ascetic life gets evolved as a consequence.\nWhen Professor Tyndall in one of his lectures tells us that Thomas Carlyle\nput him into his bath\u2010tub every morning of a freezing Berlin winter, he\nproclaimed one of the lowest grades of asceticism. Even without Carlyle,\nmost of us find it necessary to our soul\u2019s health to start the day with a\nrather cool immersion. A little farther along the scale we get such\nstatements as this, from one of my correspondents, an agnostic:\u2014\n\u201cOften at night in my warm bed I would feel ashamed to depend so\non the warmth, and whenever the thought would come over me I would\nhave to get up, no matter what time of night it was, and stand for\na minute in the cold, just so as to prove my manhood.\u201d\nSuch cases as these belong simply to our head 1. In the next case we\nprobably have a mixture of heads 2 and 3\u2014the asceticism becomes far more\nsystematic and pronounced. The writer is a Protestant, whose sense of\nmoral energy could doubtless be gratified on no lower terms, and I take\nhis case from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection.\n\u201cI practiced fasting and mortification of the flesh. I secretly\nmade burlap shirts, and put the burrs next the skin, and wore\npebbles in my shoes. I would spend nights flat on my back on the\nfloor without any covering.\u201d\nThe Roman Church has organized and codified all this sort of thing, and\ngiven it a market\u2010value in the shape of \u201cmerit.\u201d But we see the\ncultivation of hardship cropping out under every sky and in every faith,\nas a spontaneous need of character. Thus we read of Channing, when first\nsettled as a Unitarian minister, that\u2014\n\u201cHe was now more simple than ever, and seemed to have become\nincapable of any form of self\u2010indulgence. He took the smallest\nroom in the house for his study, though he might easily have\ncommanded one more light, airy, and in every way more suitable;\nand chose for his sleeping chamber an attic which he shared with a\nyounger brother. The furniture of the latter might have answered\nfor the cell of an anchorite, and consisted of a hard mattress on\na cot\u2010bedstead, plain wooden chairs and table, with matting on the\nfloor. It was without fire, and to cold he was throughout life\nextremely sensitive; but he never complained or appeared in any\nway to be conscious of inconvenience. \u2018I recollect,\u2019 says his\nbrother, \u2018after one most severe night, that in the morning he\nsportively thus alluded to his suffering: \u201cIf my bed were my\ncountry, I should be somewhat like Bonaparte: I have no control\nexcept over the part which I occupy; the instant I move, frost\ntakes possession.\u201d \u2019 In sickness only would he change for the time\nhis apartment and accept a few comforts. The dress too that he\nhabitually adopted was of most inferior quality; and garments were\nconstantly worn which the world would call mean, though an almost\nfeminine neatness preserved him from the least appearance of\nneglect.\u201d(176)\nChanning\u2019s asceticism, such as it was, was evidently a compound of\nhardihood and love of purity. The democracy which is an offshoot of the\nenthusiasm of humanity, and of which I will speak later under the head of\nthe cult of poverty, doubtless bore also a share. Certainly there was no\npessimistic element in his case. In the next case we have a strongly\npessimistic element, so that it belongs under head 4. John Cennick was\nMethodism\u2019s first lay preacher. In 1735 he was convicted of sin, while\nwalking in Cheapside,\u2014\n\u201cAnd at once left off song\u2010singing, card\u2010playing, and attending\ntheatres. Sometimes he wished to go to a popish monastery, to\nspend his life in devout retirement. At other times he longed to\nlive in a cave, sleeping on fallen leaves, and feeding on forest\nfruits. He fasted long and often, and prayed nine times a day....\nFancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so great a sinner\nas himself, he began to feed on potatoes, acorns, crabs, and\ngrass; and often wished that he could live on roots and herbs. At\nlength, in 1737, he found peace with God, and went on his way\nrejoicing.\u201d(177)\nIn this poor man we have morbid melancholy and fear, and the sacrifices\nmade are to purge out sin, and to buy safety. The hopelessness of\nChristian theology in respect of the flesh and the natural man generally\nhas, in systematizing fear, made of it one tremendous incentive to self\u2010\nmortification. It would be quite unfair, however, in spite of the fact\nthat this incentive has often been worked in a mercenary way for hortatory\npurposes, to call it a mercenary incentive. The impulse to expiate and do\npenance is, in its first intention, far too immediate and spontaneous an\nexpression of self\u2010despair and anxiety to be obnoxious to any such\nreproach. In the form of loving sacrifice, of spending all we have to show\nour devotion, ascetic discipline of the severest sort may be the fruit of\nhighly optimistic religious feeling.\nM. Vianney, the cur\u00e9 of Ars, was a French country priest, whose holiness\nwas exemplary. We read in his life the following account of his inner need\nof sacrifice:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018On this path,\u2019 M. Vianney said, \u2018it is only the first step that\ncosts. There is in mortification a balm and a savor without which\none cannot live when once one has made their acquaintance. There\nis but one way in which to give one\u2019s self to God,\u2014that is, to\ngive one\u2019s self entirely, and to keep nothing for one\u2019s self. The\nlittle that one keeps is only good to double one and make one\nsuffer.\u2019 Accordingly he imposed it on himself that he should never\nsmell a flower, never drink when parched with thirst, never drive\naway a fly, never show disgust before a repugnant object, never\ncomplain of anything that had to do with his personal comfort,\nnever sit down, never lean upon his elbows when he was kneeling.\nThe Cur\u00e9 of Ars was very sensitive to cold, but he would never\ntake means to protect himself against it. During a very severe\nwinter, one of his missionaries contrived a false floor to his\nconfessional and placed a metal case of hot water beneath. The\ntrick succeeded, and the Saint was deceived: \u2018God is very good,\u2019\nhe said with emotion. \u2018This year, through all the cold, my feet\nhave always been warm.\u2019 \u201d(178)\nIn this case the spontaneous impulse to make sacrifices for the pure love\nof God was probably the uppermost conscious motive. We may class it, then,\nunder our head 3. Some authors think that the impulse to sacrifice is the\nmain religious phenomenon. It is a prominent, a universal phenomenon\ncertainly, and lies deeper than any special creed. Here, for instance, is\nwhat seems to be a spontaneous example of it, simply expressing what\nseemed right at the time between the individual and his Maker. Cotton\nMather, the New England Puritan divine, is generally reputed a rather\ngrotesque pedant; yet what is more touchingly simple than his relation of\nwhat happened when his wife came to die?\n\u201cWhen I saw to what a point of resignation I was now called of the\nLord,\u201d he says, \u201cI resolved, with his help, therein to glorify\nhim. So, two hours before my lovely consort expired, I kneeled by\nher bedside, and I took into my two hands a dear hand, the dearest\nin the world. With her thus in my hands, I solemnly and sincerely\ngave her up unto the Lord: and in token of my real _Resignation_,\nI gently put her out of my hands, and laid away a most lovely\nhand, resolving that I would never touch it more. This was the\nhardest, and perhaps the bravest action that ever I did. She ...\ntold me that she signed and sealed my act of resignation. And\nthough before that she called for me continually, she after this\nnever asked for me any more.\u201d(179)\nFather Vianney\u2019s asceticism taken in its totality was simply the result of\na permanent flood of high spiritual enthusiasm, longing to make proof of\nitself. The Roman Church has, in its incomparable fashion, collected all\nthe motives towards asceticism together, and so codified them that any one\nwishing to pursue Christian perfection may find a practical system mapped\nout for him in any one of a number of ready\u2010made manuals.(180) The\ndominant Church notion of perfection is of course the negative one of\navoidance of sin. Sin proceeds from concupiscence, and concupiscence from\nour carnal passions and temptations, chief of which are pride, sensuality\nin all its forms, and the loves of worldly excitement and possession. All\nthese sources of sin must be resisted; and discipline and austerities are\na most efficacious mode of meeting them. Hence there are always in these\nbooks chapters on self\u2010mortification. But whenever a procedure is\ncodified, the more delicate spirit of it evaporates, and if we wish the\nundiluted ascetic spirit,\u2014the passion of self\u2010contempt wreaking itself on\nthe poor flesh, the divine irrationality of devotion making a sacrificial\ngift of all it has (its sensibilities, namely) to the object of its\nadoration,\u2014we must go to autobiographies, or other individual documents.\nSaint John of the Cross, a Spanish mystic who flourished\u2014or rather who\nexisted, for there was little that suggested flourishing about him\u2014in the\nsixteenth century, will supply a passage suitable for our purpose.\n\u201cFirst of all, carefully excite in yourself an habitual\naffectionate will in all things to imitate Jesus Christ. If\nanything agreeable offers itself to your senses, yet does not at\nthe same time tend purely to the honor and glory of God, renounce\nit and separate yourself from it for the love of Christ, who all\nhis life long had no other taste or wish than to do the will of\nhis Father whom he called his meat and nourishment. For example,\nyou take satisfaction in _hearing_ of things in which the glory of\nGod bears no part. Deny yourself this satisfaction, mortify your\nwish to listen. You take pleasure in _seeing_ objects which do not\nraise your mind to God: refuse yourself this pleasure, and turn\naway your eyes. The same with conversations and all other things.\nAct similarly, so far as you are able, with all the operations of\nthe senses, striving to make yourself free from their yokes.\n\u201cThe radical remedy lies in the mortification of the four great\nnatural passions, joy, hope, fear, and grief. You must seek to\ndeprive these of every satisfaction and leave them as it were in\ndarkness and the void. Let your soul therefore turn always:\n\u201cNot to what is most easy, but to what is hardest;\n\u201cNot to what tastes best, but to what is most distasteful;\n\u201cNot to what most pleases, but to what disgusts;\n\u201cNot to matter of consolation, but to matter for desolation\nrather;\n\u201cNot to rest, but to labor;\n\u201cNot to desire the more, but the less;\n\u201cNot to aspire to what is highest and most precious, but to what\nis lowest and most contemptible;\n\u201cNot to will anything, but to will nothing;\n\u201cNot to seek the best in everything, but to seek the worst, so\nthat you may enter for the love of Christ into a complete\ndestitution, a perfect poverty of spirit, and an absolute\nrenunciation of everything in this world.\n\u201cEmbrace these practices with all the energy of your soul and you\nwill find in a short time great delights and unspeakable\nconsolations.\n\u201cDespise yourself, and wish that others should despise you.\n\u201cSpeak to your own disadvantage, and desire others to do the same;\n\u201cConceive a low opinion of yourself, and find it good when others\nhold the same;\n\u201cTo enjoy the taste of all things, have no taste for anything.\n\u201cTo know all things, learn to know nothing.\n\u201cTo possess all things, resolve to possess nothing.\n\u201cTo be all things, be willing to be nothing.\n\u201cTo get to where you have no taste for anything, go through\nwhatever experiences you have no taste for.\n\u201cTo learn to know nothing, go whither you are ignorant.\n\u201cTo reach what you possess not, go whithersoever you own nothing.\n\u201cTo be what you are not, experience what you are not.\u201d\nThese later verses play with that vertigo of self\u2010contradiction which is\nso dear to mysticism. Those that come next are completely mystical, for in\nthem Saint John passes from God to the more metaphysical notion of the\nAll.\n\u201cWhen you stop at one thing, you cease to open yourself to the\nAll.\n\u201cFor to come to the All you must give up the All.\n\u201cAnd if you should attain to owning the All, you must own it,\ndesiring Nothing.\n\u201cIn this spoliation, the soul finds its tranquillity and rest.\nProfoundly established in the centre of its own nothingness, it\ncan be assailed by naught that comes from below; and since it no\nlonger desires anything, what comes from above cannot depress it;\nfor its desires alone are the causes of its woes.\u201d(181)\nAnd now, as a more concrete example of heads 4 and 5, in fact of all our\nheads together, and of the irrational extreme to which a psychopathic\nindividual may go in the line of bodily austerity, I will quote the\nsincere Suso\u2019s account of his own self\u2010tortures. Suso, you will remember,\nwas one of the fourteenth century German mystics; his autobiography,\nwritten in the third person, is a classic religious document.\n\u201cHe was in his youth of a temperament full of fire and life; and\nwhen this began to make itself felt, it was very grievous to him;\nand he sought by many devices how he might bring his body into\nsubjection. He wore for a long time a hair shirt and an iron\nchain, until the blood ran from him, so that he was obliged to\nleave them off. He secretly caused an undergarment to be made for\nhim; and in the undergarment he had strips of leather fixed, into\nwhich a hundred and fifty brass nails, pointed and filed sharp,\nwere driven, and the points of the nails were always turned\ntowards the flesh. He had this garment made very tight, and so\narranged as to go round him and fasten in front, in order that it\nmight fit the closer to his body, and the pointed nails might be\ndriven into his flesh; and it was high enough to reach upwards to\nhis navel. In this he used to sleep at night. Now in summer, when\nit was hot, and he was very tired and ill from his journeyings, or\nwhen he held the office of lecturer, he would sometimes, as he lay\nthus in bonds, and oppressed with toil, and tormented also by\nnoxious insects, cry aloud and give way to fretfulness, and twist\nround and round in agony, as a worm does when run through with a\npointed needle. It often seemed to him as if he were lying upon an\nant\u2010hill, from the torture caused by the insects; for if he wished\nto sleep, or when he had fallen asleep, they vied with one\nanother.(182) Sometimes he cried to Almighty God in the fullness\nof his heart: Alas! Gentle God, what a dying is this! When a man\nis killed by murderers or strong beasts of prey it is soon over;\nbut I lie dying here under the cruel insects, and yet cannot die.\nThe nights in winter were never so long, nor was the summer so\nhot, as to make him leave off this exercise. On the contrary, he\ndevised something farther\u2014two leathern loops into which he put his\nhands, and fastened one on each side his throat, and made the\nfastenings so secure that even if his cell had been on fire about\nhim, he could not have helped himself. This he continued until his\nhands and arms had become almost tremulous with the strain, and\nthen he devised something else: two leather gloves; and he caused\na brazier to fit them all over with sharp\u2010pointed brass tacks, and\nhe used to put them on at night, in order that if he should try\nwhile asleep to throw off the hair undergarment, or relieve\nhimself from the gnawings of the vile insects, the tacks might\nthen stick into his body. And so it came to pass. If ever he\nsought to help himself with his hands in his sleep, he drove the\nsharp tacks into his breast, and tore himself, so that his flesh\nfestered. When after many weeks the wounds had healed, he tore\nhimself again and made fresh wounds.\n\u201cHe continued this tormenting exercise for about sixteen years. At\nthe end of this time, when his blood was now chilled, and the fire\nof his temperament destroyed, there appeared to him in a vision on\nWhitsunday, a messenger from heaven, who told him that God\nrequired this of him no longer. Whereupon he discontinued it, and\nthrew all these things away into a running stream.\u201d\nSuso then tells how, to emulate the sorrows of his crucified Lord,\nhe made himself a cross with thirty protruding iron needles and\nnails. This he bore on his bare back between his shoulders day and\nnight. \u201cThe first time that he stretched out this cross upon his\nback his tender frame was struck with terror at it, and blunted\nthe sharp nails slightly against a stone. But soon, repenting of\nthis womanly cowardice, he pointed them all again with a file, and\nplaced once more the cross upon him. It made his back, where the\nbones are, bloody and seared. Whenever he sat down or stood up, it\nwas as if a hedgehog\u2010skin were on him. If any one touched him\nunawares, or pushed against his clothes, it tore him.\u201d\nSuso next tells of his penitences by means of striking this cross\nand forcing the nails deeper into the flesh, and likewise of his\nself\u2010scourgings,\u2014a dreadful story,\u2014and then goes on as follows:\n\u201cAt this same period the Servitor procured an old castaway door,\nand he used to lie upon it at night without any bedclothes to make\nhim comfortable, except that he took off his shoes and wrapped a\nthick cloak round him. He thus secured for himself a most\nmiserable bed; for hard pea\u2010stalks lay in humps under his head,\nthe cross with the sharp nails stuck into his back, his arms were\nlocked fast in bonds, the horsehair undergarment was round his\nloins, and the cloak too was heavy and the door hard. Thus he lay\nin wretchedness, afraid to stir, just like a log, and he would\nsend up many a sigh to God.\n\u201cIn winter he suffered very much from the frost. If he stretched\nout his feet they lay bare on the floor and froze, if he gathered\nthem up the blood became all on fire in his legs, and this was\ngreat pain. His feet were full of sores, his legs dropsical, his\nknees bloody and seared, his loins covered with scars from the\nhorsehair, his body wasted, his mouth parched with intense thirst,\nand his hands tremulous from weakness. Amid these torments he\nspent his nights and days; and he endured them all out of the\ngreatness of the love which he bore in his heart to the Divine and\nEternal Wisdom, our Lord Jesus Christ, whose agonizing sufferings\nhe sought to imitate. After a time he gave up this penitential\nexercise of the door, and instead of it he took up his abode in a\nvery small cell, and used the bench, which was so narrow and short\nthat he could not stretch himself upon it, as his bed. In this\nhole, or upon the door, he lay at night in his usual bonds, for\nabout eight years. It was also his custom, during the space of\ntwenty\u2010five years, provided he was staying in the convent, never\nto go after compline in winter into any warm room, or to the\nconvent stove to warm himself, no matter how cold it might be,\nunless he was obliged to do so for other reasons. Throughout all\nthese years he never took a bath, either a water or a sweating\nbath; and this he did in order to mortify his comfort\u2010seeking\nbody. He practiced during a long time such rigid poverty that he\nwould neither receive nor touch a penny, either with leave or\nwithout it. For a considerable time he strove to attain such a\nhigh degree of purity that he would neither scratch nor touch any\npart of his body, save only his hands and feet.\u201d(183)\nI spare you the recital of poor Suso\u2019s self\u2010inflicted tortures from\nthirst. It is pleasant to know that after his fortieth year, God showed\nhim by a series of visions that he had sufficiently broken down the\nnatural man, and that he might leave these exercises off. His case is\ndistinctly pathological, but he does not seem to have had the alleviation,\nwhich some ascetics have enjoyed, of an alteration of sensibility capable\nof actually turning torment into a perverse kind of pleasure. Of the\nfounder of the Sacred Heart order, for example, we read that\n\u201cHer love of pain and suffering was insatiable.... She said that\nshe could cheerfully live till the day of judgment, provided she\nmight always have matter for suffering for God; but that to live a\nsingle day without suffering would be intolerable. She said again\nthat she was devoured with two unassuageable fevers, one for the\nholy communion, the other for suffering, humiliation, and\nannihilation. \u2018Nothing but pain,\u2019 she continually said in her\nletters, \u2018makes my life supportable.\u2019 \u201d(184)\nSo much for the phenomena to which the ascetic impulse will in certain\npersons give rise. In the ecclesiastically consecrated character three\nminor branches of self\u2010mortification have been recognized as indispensable\npathways to perfection. I refer to the chastity, obedience, and poverty\nwhich the monk vows to observe; and upon the heads of obedience and\npoverty I will make a few remarks.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nFirst, of Obedience. The secular life of our twentieth century opens with\nthis virtue held in no high esteem. The duty of the individual to\ndetermine his own conduct and profit or suffer by the consequences seems,\non the contrary, to be one of our best rooted contemporary Protestant\nsocial ideals. So much so that it is difficult even imaginatively to\ncomprehend how men possessed of an inner life of their own could ever have\ncome to think the subjection of its will to that of other finite creatures\nrecommendable. I confess that to myself it seems something of a mystery.\nYet it evidently corresponds to a profound interior need of many persons,\nand we must do our best to understand it.\nOn the lowest possible plane, one sees how the expediency of obedience in\na firm ecclesiastical organization must have led to its being viewed as\nmeritorious. Next, experience shows that there are times in every one\u2019s\nlife when one can be better counseled by others than by one\u2019s self.\nInability to decide is one of the commonest symptoms of fatigued nerves;\nfriends who see our troubles more broadly, often see them more wisely than\nwe do; so it is frequently an act of excellent virtue to consult and obey\na doctor, a partner, or a wife. But, leaving these lower prudential\nregions, we find, in the nature of some of the spiritual excitements which\nwe have been studying, good reasons for idealizing obedience. Obedience\nmay spring from the general religious phenomenon of inner softening and\nself\u2010surrender and throwing one\u2019s self on higher powers. So saving are\nthese attitudes felt to be that in themselves, apart from utility, they\nbecome ideally consecrated; and in obeying a man whose fallibility we see\nthrough thoroughly, we, nevertheless, may feel much as we do when we\nresign our will to that of infinite wisdom. Add self\u2010despair and the\npassion of self\u2010crucifixion to this, and obedience becomes an ascetic\nsacrifice, agreeable quite irrespective of whatever prudential uses it\nmight have.\nIt is as a sacrifice, a mode of \u201cmortification,\u201d that obedience is\nprimarily conceived by Catholic writers, a \u201csacrifice which man offers to\nGod, and of which he is himself both the priest and the victim. By poverty\nhe immolates his exterior possessions; by chastity he immolates his body;\nby obedience he completes the sacrifice, and gives to God all that he yet\nholds as his own, his two most precious goods, his intellect and his will.\nThe sacrifice is then complete and unreserved, a genuine holocaust, for\nthe entire victim is now consumed for the honor of God.\u201d(185) Accordingly,\nin Catholic discipline, we obey our superior not as mere man, but as the\nrepresentative of Christ. Obeying God in him by our intention, obedience\nis easy. But when the text\u2010book theologians marshal collectively all their\nreasons for recommending it, the mixture sounds to our ears rather odd.\n\u201cOne of the great consolations of the monastic life,\u201d says a\nJesuit authority, \u201cis the assurance we have that in obeying we can\ncommit no fault. The Superior may commit a fault in commanding you\nto do this thing or that, but you are certain that you commit no\nfault so long as you obey, because God will only ask you if you\nhave duly performed what orders you received, and if you can\nfurnish a clear account in that respect, you are absolved\nentirely. Whether the things you did were opportune, or whether\nthere were not something better that might have been done, these\nare questions not asked of you, but rather of your Superior. The\nmoment what you did was done obediently, God wipes it out of your\naccount, and charges it to the Superior. So that Saint Jerome well\nexclaimed, in celebrating the advantages of obedience, \u2018Oh,\nsovereign liberty! Oh, holy and blessed security by which one\nbecomes almost impeccable!\u2019\n\u201cSaint John Climachus is of the same sentiment when he calls\nobedience an excuse before God. In fact, when God asks why you\nhave done this or that, and you reply, it is because I was so\nordered by my Superiors, God will ask for no other excuse. As a\npassenger in a good vessel with a good pilot need give himself no\nfarther concern, but may go to sleep in peace, because the pilot\nhas charge over all, and \u2018watches for him\u2019; so a religious person\nwho lives under the yoke of obedience goes to heaven as if while\nsleeping, that is, while leaning entirely on the conduct of his\nSuperiors, who are the pilots of his vessel, and keep watch for\nhim continually. It is no small thing, of a truth, to be able to\ncross the stormy sea of life on the shoulders and in the arms of\nanother, yet that is just the grace which God accords to those who\nlive under the yoke of obedience. Their Superior bears all their\nburdens.... A certain grave doctor said that he would rather spend\nhis life in picking up straws by obedience, than by his own\nresponsible choice busy himself with the loftiest works of\ncharity, because one is certain of following the will of God in\nwhatever one may do from obedience, but never certain in the same\ndegree of anything which we may do of our own proper\nmovement.\u201d(186)\nOne should read the letters in which Ignatius Loyola recommends obedience\nas the backbone of his order, if one would gain insight into the full\nspirit of its cult.(187) They are too long to quote; but Ignatius\u2019s belief\nis so vividly expressed in a couple of sayings reported by companions\nthat, though they have been so often cited, I will ask your permission to\ncopy them once more:\u2014\n\u201cI ought,\u201d an early biographer reports him as saying, \u201con entering\nreligion, and thereafter, to place myself entirely in the hands of\nGod, and of him who takes His place by His authority. I ought to\ndesire that my Superior should oblige me to give up my own\njudgment, and conquer my own mind. I ought to set up no difference\nbetween one Superior and another, ... but recognize them all as\nequal before God, whose place they fill. For if I distinguish\npersons, I weaken the spirit of obedience. In the hands of my\nSuperior, I must be a soft wax, a thing, from which he is to\nrequire whatever pleases him, be it to write or receive letters,\nto speak or not to speak to such a person, or the like; and I must\nput all my fervor in executing zealously and exactly what I am\nordered. I must consider myself as a corpse which has neither\nintelligence nor will; be like a mass of matter which without\nresistance lets itself be placed wherever it may please any one;\nlike a stick in the hand of an old man, who uses it according to\nhis needs and places it where it suits him. So must I be under the\nhands of the Order, to serve it in the way it judges most useful.\n\u201cI must never ask of the Superior to be sent to a particular\nplace, to be employed in a particular duty.... I must consider\nnothing as belonging to me personally, and as regards the things I\nuse, be like a statue which lets itself be stripped and never\nopposes resistance.\u201d(188)\nThe other saying is reported by Rodriguez in the chapter from which I a\nmoment ago made quotations. When speaking of the Pope\u2019s authority,\nRodriguez writes:\u2014\n\u201cSaint Ignatius said, when general of his company, that if the\nHoly Father were to order him to set sail in the first bark which\nhe might find in the port of Ostia, near Rome, and to abandon\nhimself to the sea, without a mast, without sails, without oars or\nrudder or any of the things that are needful for navigation or\nsubsistence, he would obey not only with alacrity, but without\nanxiety or repugnance, and even with a great internal\nsatisfaction.\u201d(189)\nWith a solitary concrete example of the extravagance to which the virtue\nwe are considering has been carried, I will pass to the topic next in\norder.\n\u201cSister Marie Claire [of Port Royal] had been greatly imbued with\nthe holiness and excellence of M. de Langres. This prelate, soon\nafter he came to Port Royal, said to her one day, seeing her so\ntenderly attached to Mother Ang\u00e9lique, that it would perhaps be\nbetter not to speak to her again. Marie Claire, greedy of\nobedience, took this inconsiderate word for an oracle of God, and\nfrom that day forward remained for several years without once\nspeaking to her sister.\u201d(190)\nOur next topic shall be Poverty, felt at all times and under all creeds as\none adornment of a saintly life. Since the instinct of ownership is\nfundamental in man\u2019s nature, this is one more example of the ascetic\nparadox. Yet it appears no paradox at all, but perfectly reasonable, the\nmoment one recollects how easily higher excitements hold lower cupidities\nin check. Having just quoted the Jesuit Rodriguez on the subject of\nobedience, I will, to give immediately a concrete turn to our discussion\nof poverty, also read you a page from his chapter on this latter virtue.\nYou must remember that he is writing instructions for monks of his own\norder, and bases them all on the text, \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit.\u201d\n\u201cIf any one of you,\u201d he says, \u201cwill know whether or not he is\nreally poor in spirit, let him consider whether he loves the\nordinary consequences and effects of poverty, which are hunger,\nthirst, cold, fatigue, and the denudation of all conveniences. See\nif you are glad to wear a worn\u2010out habit full of patches. See if\nyou are glad when something is lacking to your meal, when you are\npassed by in serving it, when what you receive is distasteful to\nyou, when your cell is out of repair. If you are not glad of these\nthings, if instead of loving them you avoid them, then there is\nproof that you have not attained the perfection of poverty of\nspirit.\u201d Rodriguez then goes on to describe the practice of\npoverty in more detail. \u201cThe first point is that which Saint\nIgnatius proposes in his constitutions, when he says, \u2018Let no one\nuse anything as if it were his private possession.\u2019 \u2018A religious\nperson,\u2019 he says, \u2018ought in respect to all the things that he\nuses, to be like a statue which one may drape with clothing, but\nwhich feels no grief and makes no resistance when one strips it\nagain. It is in this way that you should feel towards your\nclothes, your books, your cell, and everything else that you make\nuse of; if ordered to quit them, or to exchange them for others,\nhave no more sorrow than if you were a statue being uncovered. In\nthis way you will avoid using them as if they were your private\npossession. But if, when you give up your cell, or yield\npossession of this or that object or exchange it for another, you\nfeel repugnance and are not like a statue, that shows that you\nview these things as if they were your private property.\u2019\n\u201cAnd this is why our holy founder wished the superiors to test\ntheir monks somewhat as God tested Abraham, and to put their\npoverty and their obedience to trial, that by this means they may\nbecome acquainted with the degree of their virtue, and gain a\nchance to make ever farther progress in perfection, ... making the\none move out of his room when he finds it comfortable and is\nattached to it; taking away from another a book of which he is\nfond; or obliging a third to exchange his garment for a worse one.\nOtherwise we should end by acquiring a species of property in all\nthese several objects, and little by little the wall of poverty\nthat surrounds us and constitutes our principal defense would be\nthrown down. The ancient fathers of the desert used often thus to\ntreat their companions.... Saint Dositheus, being sick\u2010nurse,\ndesired a certain knife, and asked Saint Dorotheus for it, not for\nhis private use, but for employment in the infirmary of which he\nhad charge. Whereupon Saint Dorotheus answered him: \u2018Ha!\nDositheus, so that knife pleases you so much! Will you be the\nslave of a knife or the slave of Jesus Christ? Do you not blush\nwith shame at wishing that a knife should be your master? I will\nnot let you touch it.\u2019 Which reproach and refusal had such an\neffect upon the holy disciple that since that time he never\ntouched the knife again.\u201d ...\n\u201cTherefore, in our rooms,\u201d Father Rodriguez continues, \u201cthere must\nbe no other furniture than a bed, a table, a bench, and a\ncandlestick, things purely necessary, and nothing more. It is not\nallowed among us that our cells should be ornamented with pictures\nor aught else, neither armchairs, carpets, curtains, nor any sort\nof cabinet or bureau of any elegance. Neither is it allowed us to\nkeep anything to eat, either for ourselves or for those who may\ncome to visit us. We must ask permission to go to the refectory\neven for a glass of water; and finally we may not keep a book in\nwhich we can write a line, or which we may take away with us. One\ncannot deny that thus we are in great poverty. But this poverty is\nat the same time a great repose and a great perfection. For it\nwould be inevitable, in case a religious person were allowed to\nown superfluous possessions, that these things would greatly\noccupy his mind, be it to acquire them, to preserve them, or to\nincrease them; so that in not permitting us at all to own them,\nall these inconveniences are remedied. Among the various good\nreasons why the company forbids secular persons to enter our\ncells, the principal one is that thus we may the easier be kept in\npoverty. After all, we are all men, and if we were to receive\npeople of the world into our rooms, we should not have the\nstrength to remain within the bounds prescribed, but should at\nleast wish to adorn them with some books to give the visitors a\nbetter opinion of our scholarship.\u201d(191)\nSince Hindu fakirs, Buddhist monks, and Mohammedan dervishes unite with\nJesuits and Franciscans in idealizing poverty as the loftiest individual\nstate, it is worth while to examine into the spiritual grounds for such a\nseemingly unnatural opinion. And first, of those which lie closest to\ncommon human nature.\nThe opposition between the men who _have_ and the men who _are_ is\nimmemorial. Though the gentleman, in the old\u2010fashioned sense of the man\nwho is well born, has usually in point of fact been predaceous and reveled\nin lands and goods, yet he has never identified his essence with these\npossessions, but rather with the personal superiorities, the courage,\ngenerosity, and pride supposed to be his birthright. To certain\nhuckstering kinds of consideration he thanked God he was forever\ninaccessible, and if in life\u2019s vicissitudes he should become destitute\nthrough their lack, he was glad to think that with his sheer valor he was\nall the freer to work out his salvation. \u201cWer nur selbst was h\u00e4tte,\u201d says\nLessing\u2019s Tempelherr, in Nathan the Wise, \u201cmein Gott, mein Gott, ich habe\nnichts!\u201d This ideal of the well\u2010born man without possessions was embodied\nin knight\u2010errantry and templardom; and, hideously corrupted as it has\nalways been, it still dominates sentimentally, if not practically, the\nmilitary and aristocratic view of life. We glorify the soldier as the man\nabsolutely unencumbered. Owning nothing but his bare life, and willing to\ntoss that up at any moment when the cause commands him, he is the\nrepresentative of unhampered freedom in ideal directions. The laborer who\npays with his person day by day, and has no rights invested in the future,\noffers also much of this ideal detachment. Like the savage, he may make\nhis bed wherever his right arm can support him, and from his simple and\nathletic attitude of observation, the property\u2010owner seems buried and\nsmothered in ignoble externalities and trammels, \u201cwading in straw and\nrubbish to his knees.\u201d The claims which _things_ make are corrupters of\nmanhood, mortgages on the soul, and a drag anchor on our progress towards\nthe empyrean.\n\u201cEverything I meet with,\u201d writes Whitefield, \u201cseems to carry this\nvoice with it,\u2014\u2018Go thou and preach the Gospel; be a pilgrim on\nearth; have no party or certain dwelling place.\u2019 My heart echoes\nback, \u2018Lord Jesus, help me to do or suffer thy will. When thou\nseest me in danger of _nestling_,\u2014in pity\u2014in tender pity,\u2014put a\n_thorn_ in my nest to prevent me from it.\u2019 \u201d(192)\nThe loathing of \u201ccapital\u201d with which our laboring classes to\u2010day are\ngrowing more and more infected seems largely composed of this sound\nsentiment of antipathy for lives based on mere having. As an anarchist\npoet writes:\u2014\n\u201cNot by accumulating riches, but by giving away that which you\nhave,\n\u201cShall you become beautiful;\n\u201cYou must undo the wrappings, not case yourself in fresh ones;\n\u201cNot by multiplying clothes shall you make your body sound and\nhealthy, but rather by discarding them ...\n\u201cFor a soldier who is going on a campaign does not seek what fresh\nfurniture he can carry on his back, but rather what he can leave\nbehind;\n\u201cKnowing well that every additional thing which he cannot freely\nuse and handle is an impediment.\u201d(193)\nIn short, lives based on having are less free than lives based either on\ndoing or on being, and in the interest of action people subject to\nspiritual excitement throw away possessions as so many clogs. Only those\nwho have no private interests can follow an ideal straight away. Sloth and\ncowardice creep in with every dollar or guinea we have to guard. When a\nbrother novice came to Saint Francis, saying: \u201cFather, it would be a great\nconsolation to me to own a psalter, but even supposing that our general\nshould concede to me this indulgence, still I should like also to have\nyour consent,\u201d Francis put him off with the examples of Charlemagne,\nRoland, and Oliver, pursuing the infidels in sweat and labor, and finally\ndying on the field of battle. \u201cSo care not,\u201d he said, \u201cfor owning books\nand knowledge, but care rather for works of goodness.\u201d And when some weeks\nlater the novice came again to talk of his craving for the psalter,\nFrancis said: \u201cAfter you have got your psalter you will crave a breviary;\nand after you have got your breviary you will sit in your stall like a\ngrand prelate, and will say to your brother: \u2018Hand me my breviary.\u2019 ...\nAnd thenceforward he denied all such requests, saying: \u2018A man possesses of\nlearning only so much as comes out of him in action, and a monk is a good\npreacher only so far as his deeds proclaim him such, for every tree is\nknown by its fruits.\u2019 \u201d(194)\nBut beyond this more worthily athletic attitude involved in doing and\nbeing, there is, in the desire of not having, something profounder still,\nsomething related to that fundamental mystery of religious experience, the\nsatisfaction found in absolute surrender to the larger power. So long as\nany secular safeguard is retained, so long as any residual prudential\nguarantee is clung to, so long the surrender is incomplete, the vital\ncrisis is not passed, fear still stands sentinel, and mistrust of the\ndivine obtains: we hold by two anchors, looking to God, it is true, after\na fashion, but also holding by our proper machinations. In certain medical\nexperiences we have the same critical point to overcome. A drunkard, or a\nmorphine or cocaine maniac, offers himself to be cured. He appeals to the\ndoctor to wean him from his enemy, but he dares not face blank abstinence.\nThe tyrannical drug is still an anchor to windward: he hides supplies of\nit among his clothing; arranges secretly to have it smuggled in in case of\nneed. Even so an incompletely regenerate man still trusts in his own\nexpedients. His money is like the sleeping potion which the chronically\nwakeful patient keeps beside his bed; he throws himself on God, but _if_\nhe should need the other help, there it will be also. Every one knows\ncases of this incomplete and ineffective desire for reform,\u2014drunkards\nwhom, with all their self\u2010reproaches and resolves, one perceives to be\nquite unwilling seriously to contemplate _never_ being drunk again! Really\nto give up anything on which we have relied, to give it up definitively,\n\u201cfor good and all\u201d and forever, signifies one of those radical alterations\nof character which came under our notice in the lectures on conversion. In\nit the inner man rolls over into an entirely different position of\nequilibrium, lives in a new centre of energy from this time on, and the\nturning\u2010point and hinge of all such operations seems usually to involve\nthe sincere acceptance of certain nakednesses and destitutions.\nAccordingly, throughout the annals of the saintly life, we find this ever\u2010\nrecurring note: Fling yourself upon God\u2019s providence without making any\nreserve whatever,\u2014take no thought for the morrow,\u2014sell all you have and\ngive it to the poor,\u2014only when the sacrifice is ruthless and reckless will\nthe higher safety really arrive. As a concrete example let me read a page\nfrom the biography of Antoinette Bourignon, a good woman, much persecuted\nin her day by both Protestants and Catholics, because she would not take\nher religion at second hand. When a young girl, in her father\u2019s house,\u2014\n\u201cShe spent whole nights in prayer, oft repeating: _Lord, what wilt\nthou have me to do?_ And being one night in a most profound\npenitence, she said from the bottom of her heart: \u2018O my Lord! What\nmust I do to please thee? For I have nobody to teach me. Speak to\nmy soul and it will hear thee.\u2019 At that instant she heard, as if\nanother had spoke within her: _Forsake all earthly things.\nSeparate thyself from the love of the creatures. Deny thyself._\nShe was quite astonished, not understanding this language, and\nmused long on these three points, thinking how she could fulfill\nthem. She thought she could not live without earthly things, nor\nwithout loving the creatures, nor without loving herself. Yet she\nsaid, \u2018By thy Grace I will do it, Lord!\u2019 But when she would\nperform her promise, she knew not where to begin. Having thought\non the religious in monasteries, that they forsook all earthly\nthings by being shut up in a cloister, and the love of themselves\nby subjecting of their wills, she asked leave of her father to\nenter into a cloister of the barefoot Carmelites, but he would not\npermit it, saying he would rather see her laid in her grave. This\nseemed to her a great cruelty, for she thought to find in the\ncloister the true Christians she had been seeking, but she found\nafterwards that he knew the cloisters better than she; for after\nhe had forbidden her, and told her he would never permit her to be\na religious, nor give her any money to enter there, yet she went\nto Father Laurens, the Director, and offered to serve in the\nmonastery and work hard for her bread, and be content with little,\nif he would receive her. At which he smiled and said: _That cannot\nbe. We must have money to build; we take no maids without money;\nyou must find the way to get it, else there is no entry here._\n\u201cThis astonished her greatly, and she was thereby undeceived as to\nthe cloisters, resolving to forsake all company and live alone\ntill it should please God to show her what she ought to do and\nwhither to go. She asked always earnestly, \u2018When shall I be\nperfectly thine, O my God?\u2019 And she thought he still answered her,\n_When thou shalt no longer possess anything, and shalt die to\nthyself_. \u2018And where shall I do that, Lord?\u2019 He answered her, _In\nthe desert_. This made so strong an impression on her soul that\nshe aspired after this; but being a maid of eighteen years only,\nshe was afraid of unlucky chances, and was never used to travel,\nand knew no way. She laid aside all these doubts and said, \u2018Lord,\nthou wilt guide me how and where it shall please thee. It is for\nthee that I do it. I will lay aside my habit of a maid, and will\ntake that of a hermit that I may pass unknown.\u2019 Having then\nsecretly made ready this habit, while her parents thought to have\nmarried her, her father having promised her to a rich French\nmerchant, she prevented the time, and on Easter evening, having\ncut her hair, put on the habit, and slept a little, she went out\nof her chamber about four in the morning, taking nothing but one\npenny to buy bread for that day. And it being said to her in the\ngoing out, _Where is thy faith? in a penny?_ she threw it away,\nbegging pardon of God for her fault, and saying, \u2018No, Lord, my\nfaith is not in a penny, but in thee alone.\u2019 Thus she went away\nwholly delivered from the heavy burthen of the cares and good\nthings of this world, and found her soul so satisfied that she no\nlonger wished for anything upon earth, resting entirely upon God,\nwith this only fear lest she should be discovered and be obliged\nto return home; for she felt already more content in this poverty\nthan she had done for all her life in all the delights of the\nworld.\u201d(195)\nThe penny was a small financial safeguard, but an effective spiritual\nobstacle. Not till it was thrown away could the character settle into the\nnew equilibrium completely.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOver and above the mystery of self\u2010surrender, there are in the cult of\npoverty other religious mysteries. There is the mystery of veracity:\n\u201cNaked came I into the world,\u201d etc.,\u2014whoever first said that, possessed\nthis mystery. My own bare entity must fight the battle\u2014shams cannot save\nme. There is also the mystery of democracy, or sentiment of the equality\nbefore God of all his creatures. This sentiment (which seems in general to\nhave been more widespread in Mohammedan than in Christian lands) tends to\nnullify man\u2019s usual acquisitiveness. Those who have it spurn dignities and\nhonors, privileges and advantages, preferring, as I said in a former\nlecture, to grovel on the common level before the face of God. It is not\nexactly the sentiment of humility, though it comes so close to it in\npractice. It is _humanity_, rather, refusing to enjoy anything that others\ndo not share. A profound moralist, writing of Christ\u2019s saying, \u201cSell all\nthou hast and follow me,\u201d proceeds as follows:\u2014\n\u201cChrist may have meant: If you love mankind absolutely you will as\na result not care for any possessions whatever, and this seems a\nvery likely proposition. But it is one thing to believe that a\nproposition is probably true; it is another thing to see it as a\nfact. If you loved mankind as Christ loved them, you would see his\nconclusion as a fact. It would be obvious. You would sell your\ngoods, and they would be no loss to you. These truths, while\nliteral to Christ, and to any mind that has Christ\u2019s love for\nmankind, become parables to lesser natures. There are in every\ngeneration people who, beginning innocently, with no predetermined\nintention of becoming saints, find themselves drawn into the\nvortex by their interest in helping mankind, and by the\nunderstanding that comes from actually doing it. The abandonment\nof their old mode of life is like dust in the balance. It is done\ngradually, incidentally, imperceptibly. Thus the whole question of\nthe abandonment of luxury is no question at all, but a mere\nincident to another question, namely, the degree to which we\nabandon ourselves to the remorseless logic of our love for\nothers.\u201d(196)\nBut in all these matters of sentiment one must have \u201cbeen there\u201d one\u2019s\nself in order to understand them. No American can ever attain to\nunderstanding the loyalty of a Briton towards his king, of a German\ntowards his emperor; nor can a Briton or German ever understand the peace\nof heart of an American in having no king, no Kaiser, no spurious\nnonsense, between him and the common God of all. If sentiments as simple\nas these are mysteries which one must receive as gifts of birth, how much\nmore is this the case with those subtler religious sentiments which we\nhave been considering! One can never fathom an emotion or divine its\ndictates by standing outside of it. In the glowing hour of excitement,\nhowever, all incomprehensibilities are solved, and what was so enigmatical\nfrom without becomes transparently obvious. Each emotion obeys a logic of\nits own, and makes deductions which no other logic can draw. Piety and\ncharity live in a different universe from worldly lusts and fears, and\nform another centre of energy altogether. As in a supreme sorrow lesser\nvexations may become a consolation; as a supreme love may turn minor\nsacrifices into gain; so a supreme trust may render common safeguards\nodious, and in certain glows of generous excitement it may appear\nunspeakably mean to retain one\u2019s hold of personal possessions. The only\nsound plan, if we are ourselves outside the pale of such emotions, is to\nobserve as well as we are able those who feel them, and to record\nfaithfully what we observe; and this, I need hardly say, is what I have\nstriven to do in these last two descriptive lectures, which I now hope\nwill have covered the ground sufficiently for our present needs.\nLECTURES XIV AND XV. THE VALUE OF SAINTLINESS.\nWe have now passed in review the more important of the phenomena which are\nregarded as fruits of genuine religion and characteristics of men who are\ndevout. To\u2010day we have to change our attitude from that of description to\nthat of appreciation; we have to ask whether the fruits in question can\nhelp us to judge the absolute value of what religion adds to human life.\nWere I to parody Kant, I should say that a \u201cCritique of pure Saintliness\u201d\nmust be our theme.\nIf, in turning to this theme, we could descend upon our subject from above\nlike Catholic theologians, with our fixed definitions of man and man\u2019s\nperfection and our positive dogmas about God, we should have an easy time\nof it. Man\u2019s perfection would be the fulfillment of his end; and his end\nwould be union with his Maker. That union could be pursued by him along\nthree paths, active, purgative, and contemplative, respectively; and\nprogress along either path would be a simple matter to measure by the\napplication of a limited number of theological and moral conceptions and\ndefinitions. The absolute significance and value of any bit of religious\nexperience we might hear of would thus be given almost mathematically into\nour hands.\nIf convenience were everything, we ought now to grieve at finding\nourselves cut off from so admirably convenient a method as this. But we\ndid cut ourselves off from it deliberately in those remarks which you\nremember we made, in our first lecture, about the empirical method; and it\nmust be confessed that after that act of renunciation we can never hope\nfor clean\u2010cut and scholastic results. _We_ cannot divide man sharply into\nan animal and a rational part. _We_ cannot distinguish natural from\nsupernatural effects; nor among the latter know which are favors of God,\nand which are counterfeit operations of the demon. We have merely to\ncollect things together without any special _a priori_ theological system,\nand out of an aggregate of piecemeal judgments as to the value of this and\nthat experience\u2014judgments in which our general philosophic prejudices, our\ninstincts, and our common sense are our only guides\u2014decide that _on the\nwhole_ one type of religion is approved by its fruits, and another type\ncondemned. \u201cOn the whole,\u201d\u2014I fear we shall never escape complicity with\nthat qualification, so dear to your practical man, so repugnant to your\nsystematizer!\nI also fear that as I make this frank confession, I may seem to some of\nyou to throw our compass overboard, and to adopt caprice as our pilot.\nSkepticism or wayward choice, you may think, can be the only results of\nsuch a formless method as I have taken up. A few remarks in deprecation of\nsuch an opinion, and in farther explanation of the empiricist principles\nwhich I profess, may therefore appear at this point to be in place.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nAbstractly, it would seem illogical to try to measure the worth of a\nreligion\u2019s fruits in merely human terms of value. How _can_ you measure\ntheir worth without considering whether the God really exists who is\nsupposed to inspire them? If he really exists, then all the conduct\ninstituted by men to meet his wants must necessarily be a reasonable fruit\nof his religion,\u2014it would be unreasonable only in case he did not exist.\nIf, for instance, you were to condemn a religion of human or animal\nsacrifices by virtue of your subjective sentiments, and if all the while a\ndeity were really there demanding such sacrifices, you would be making a\ntheoretical mistake by tacitly assuming that the deity must be non\u2010\nexistent; you would be setting up a theology of your own as much as if you\nwere a scholastic philosopher.\nTo this extent, to the extent of disbelieving peremptorily in certain\ntypes of deity, I frankly confess that we must be theologians. If\ndisbeliefs can be said to constitute a theology, then the prejudices,\ninstincts, and common sense which I chose as our guides make theological\npartisans of us whenever they make certain beliefs abhorrent.\nBut such common\u2010sense prejudices and instincts are themselves the fruit of\nan empirical evolution. Nothing is more striking than the secular\nalteration that goes on in the moral and religious tone of men, as their\ninsight into nature and their social arrangements progressively develop.\nAfter an interval of a few generations the mental climate proves\nunfavorable to notions of the deity which at an earlier date were\nperfectly satisfactory: the older gods have fallen below the common\nsecular level, and can no longer be believed in. To\u2010day a deity who should\nrequire bleeding sacrifices to placate him would be too sanguinary to be\ntaken seriously. Even if powerful historical credentials were put forward\nin his favor, we would not look at them. Once, on the contrary, his cruel\nappetites were of themselves credentials. They positively recommended him\nto men\u2019s imaginations in ages when such coarse signs of power were\nrespected and no others could be understood. Such deities then were\nworshiped because such fruits were relished.\nDoubtless historic accidents always played some later part, but the\noriginal factor in fixing the figure of the gods must always have been\npsychological. The deity to whom the prophets, seers, and devotees who\nfounded the particular cult bore witness was worth something to them\npersonally. They could use him. He guided their imagination, warranted\ntheir hopes, and controlled their will,\u2014or else they required him as a\nsafeguard against the demon and a curber of other people\u2019s crimes. In any\ncase, they chose him for the value of the fruits he seemed to them to\nyield. So soon as the fruits began to seem quite worthless; so soon as\nthey conflicted with indispensable human ideals, or thwarted too\nextensively other values; so soon as they appeared childish, contemptible,\nor immoral when reflected on, the deity grew discredited, and was erelong\nneglected and forgotten. It was in this way that the Greek and Roman gods\nceased to be believed in by educated pagans; it is thus that we ourselves\njudge of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Mohammedan theologies; Protestants have\nso dealt with the Catholic notions of deity, and liberal Protestants with\nolder Protestant notions; it is thus that Chinamen judge of us, and that\nall of us now living will be judged by our descendants. When we cease to\nadmire or approve what the definition of a deity implies, we end by\ndeeming that deity incredible.\nFew historic changes are more curious than these mutations of theological\nopinion. The monarchical type of sovereignty was, for example, so\nineradicably planted in the mind of our own forefathers that a dose of\ncruelty and arbitrariness in their deity seems positively to have been\nrequired by their imagination. They called the cruelty \u201cretributive\njustice,\u201d and a God without it would certainly have struck them as not\n\u201csovereign\u201d enough. But to\u2010day we abhor the very notion of eternal\nsuffering inflicted; and that arbitrary dealing\u2010out of salvation and\ndamnation to selected individuals, of which Jonathan Edwards could\npersuade himself that he had not only a conviction, but a \u201cdelightful\nconviction,\u201d as of a doctrine \u201cexceeding pleasant, bright, and sweet,\u201d\nappears to us, if sovereignly anything, sovereignly irrational and mean.\nNot only the cruelty, but the paltriness of character of the gods believed\nin by earlier centuries also strikes later centuries with surprise. We\nshall see examples of it from the annals of Catholic saintship which make\nus rub our Protestant eyes. Ritual worship in general appears to the\nmodern transcendentalist, as well as to the ultra\u2010puritanic type of mind,\nas if addressed to a deity of an almost absurdly childish character,\ntaking delight in toy\u2010shop furniture, tapers and tinsel, costume and\nmumbling and mummery, and finding his \u201cglory\u201d incomprehensibly enhanced\nthereby;\u2014just as on the other hand the formless spaciousness of pantheism\nappears quite empty to ritualistic natures, and the gaunt theism of\nevangelical sects seems intolerably bald and chalky and bleak. Luther,\nsays Emerson, would have cut off his right hand rather than nail his\ntheses to the door at Wittenberg, if he had supposed that they were\ndestined to lead to the pale negations of Boston Unitarianism.\nSo far, then, although we are compelled, whatever may be our pretensions\nto empiricism, to employ some sort of a standard of theological\nprobability of our own whenever we assume to estimate the fruits of other\nmen\u2019s religion, yet this very standard has been begotten out of the drift\nof common life. It is the voice of human experience within us, judging and\ncondemning all gods that stand athwart the pathway along which it feels\nitself to be advancing. Experience, if we take it in the largest sense, is\nthus the parent of those disbeliefs which, it was charged, were\ninconsistent with the experiential method. The inconsistency, you see, is\nimmaterial, and the charge may be neglected.\nIf we pass from disbeliefs to positive beliefs, it seems to me that there\nis not even a formal inconsistency to be laid against our method. The gods\nwe stand by are the gods we need and can use, the gods whose demands on us\nare reinforcements of our demands on ourselves and on one another. What I\nthen propose to do is, briefly stated, to test saintliness by common\nsense, to use human standards to help us decide how far the religious life\ncommends itself as an ideal kind of human activity. If it commends itself,\nthen any theological beliefs that may inspire it, in so far forth will\nstand accredited. If not, then they will be discredited, and all without\nreference to anything but human working principles. It is but the\nelimination of the humanly unfit, and the survival of the humanly fittest,\napplied to religious beliefs; and if we look at history candidly and\nwithout prejudice, we have to admit that no religion has ever in the long\nrun established or proved itself in any other way. Religions have\n_approved_ themselves; they have ministered to sundry vital needs which\nthey found reigning. When they violated other needs too strongly, or when\nother faiths came which served the same needs better, the first religions\nwere supplanted.\nThe needs were always many, and the tests were never sharp. So the\nreproach of vagueness and subjectivity and \u201con the whole\u201d\u2010ness, which can\nwith perfect legitimacy be addressed to the empirical method as we are\nforced to use it, is after all a reproach to which the entire life of man\nin dealing with these matters is obnoxious. No religion has ever yet owed\nits prevalence to \u201capodictic certainty.\u201d In a later lecture I will ask\nwhether objective certainty can ever be added by theological reasoning to\na religion that already empirically prevails.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOne word, also, about the reproach that in following this sort of an\nempirical method we are handing ourselves over to systematic skepticism.\nSince it is impossible to deny secular alterations in our sentiments and\nneeds, it would be absurd to affirm that one\u2019s own age of the world can be\nbeyond correction by the next age. Skepticism cannot, therefore, be ruled\nout by any set of thinkers as a possibility against which their\nconclusions are secure; and no empiricist ought to claim exemption from\nthis universal liability. But to admit one\u2019s liability to correction is\none thing, and to embark upon a sea of wanton doubt is another. Of\nwillfully playing into the hands of skepticism we cannot be accused. He\nwho acknowledges the imperfectness of his instrument, and makes allowance\nfor it in discussing his observations, is in a much better position for\ngaining truth than if he claimed his instrument to be infallible. Or is\ndogmatic or scholastic theology less doubted in point of fact for\nclaiming, as it does, to be in point of right undoubtable? And if not,\nwhat command over truth would this kind of theology really lose if,\ninstead of absolute certainty, she only claimed reasonable probability for\nher conclusions? If _we_ claim only reasonable probability, it will be as\nmuch as men who love the truth can ever at any given moment hope to have\nwithin their grasp. Pretty surely it will be more than we could have had,\nif we were unconscious of our liability to err.\nNevertheless, dogmatism will doubtless continue to condemn us for this\nconfession. The mere outward form of inalterable certainty is so precious\nto some minds that to renounce it explicitly is for them out of the\nquestion. They will claim it even where the facts most patently pronounce\nits folly. But the safe thing is surely to recognize that all the insights\nof creatures of a day like ourselves must be provisional. The wisest of\ncritics is an altering being, subject to the better insight of the morrow,\nand right at any moment, only \u201cup to date\u201d and \u201con the whole.\u201d When larger\nranges of truth open, it is surely best to be able to open ourselves to\ntheir reception, unfettered by our previous pretensions. \u201cHeartily know,\nwhen half\u2010gods go, the gods arrive.\u201d\nThe fact of diverse judgments about religious phenomena is therefore\nentirely unescapable, whatever may be one\u2019s own desire to attain the\nirreversible. But apart from that fact, a more fundamental question awaits\nus, the question whether men\u2019s opinions ought to be expected to be\nabsolutely uniform in this field. Ought all men to have the same religion?\nOught they to approve the same fruits and follow the same leadings? Are\nthey so like in their inner needs that, for hard and soft, for proud and\nhumble, for strenuous and lazy, for healthy\u2010minded and despairing, exactly\nthe same religious incentives are required? Or are different functions in\nthe organism of humanity allotted to different types of man, so that some\nmay really be the better for a religion of consolation and reassurance,\nwhilst others are better for one of terror and reproof? It might\nconceivably be so; and we shall, I think, more and more suspect it to be\nso as we go on. And if it be so, how can any possible judge or critic help\nbeing biased in favor of the religion by which his own needs are best met?\nHe aspires to impartiality; but he is too close to the struggle not to be\nto some degree a participant, and he is sure to approve most warmly those\nfruits of piety in others which taste most good and prove most nourishing\nto _him_.\nI am well aware of how anarchic much of what I say may sound. Expressing\nmyself thus abstractly and briefly, I may seem to despair of the very\nnotion of truth. But I beseech you to reserve your judgment until we see\nit applied to the details which lie before us. I do indeed disbelieve that\nwe or any other mortal men can attain on a given day to absolutely\nincorrigible and unimprovable truth about such matters of fact as those\nwith which religions deal. But I reject this dogmatic ideal not out of a\nperverse delight in intellectual instability. I am no lover of disorder\nand doubt as such. Rather do I fear to lose truth by this pretension to\npossess it already wholly. That we can gain more and more of it by moving\nalways in the right direction, I believe as much as any one, and I hope to\nbring you all to my way of thinking before the termination of these\nlectures. Till then, do not, I pray you, harden your minds irrevocably\nagainst the empiricism which I profess.\nI will waste no more words, then, in abstract justification of my method,\nbut seek immediately to use it upon the facts.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn critically judging of the value of religious phenomena, it is very\nimportant to insist on the distinction between religion as an individual\npersonal function, and religion as an institutional, corporate, or tribal\nproduct. I drew this distinction, you may remember, in my second lecture.\nThe word \u201creligion,\u201d as ordinarily used, is equivocal. A survey of history\nshows us that, as a rule, religious geniuses attract disciples, and\nproduce groups of sympathizers. When these groups get strong enough to\n\u201corganize\u201d themselves, they become ecclesiastical institutions with\ncorporate ambitions of their own. The spirit of politics and the lust of\ndogmatic rule are then apt to enter and to contaminate the originally\ninnocent thing; so that when we hear the word \u201creligion\u201d nowadays, we\nthink inevitably of some \u201cchurch\u201d or other; and to some persons the word\n\u201cchurch\u201d suggests so much hypocrisy and tyranny and meanness and tenacity\nof superstition that in a wholesale undiscerning way they glory in saying\nthat they are \u201cdown\u201d on religion altogether. Even we who belong to\nchurches do not exempt other churches than our own from the general\ncondemnation.\nBut in this course of lectures ecclesiastical institutions hardly concern\nus at all. The religious experience which we are studying is that which\nlives itself out within the private breast. First\u2010hand individual\nexperience of this kind has always appeared as a heretical sort of\ninnovation to those who witnessed its birth. Naked comes it into the world\nand lonely; and it has always, for a time at least, driven him who had it\ninto the wilderness, often into the literal wilderness out of doors, where\nthe Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, St. Francis, George Fox, and so many others\nhad to go. George Fox expresses well this isolation; and I can do no\nbetter at this point than read to you a page from his Journal, referring\nto the period of his youth when religion began to ferment within him\nseriously.\n\u201cI fasted much,\u201d Fox says, \u201cwalked abroad in solitary places many\ndays, and often took my Bible, and sat in hollow trees and\nlonesome places until night came on; and frequently in the night\nwalked mournfully about by myself; for I was a man of sorrows in\nthe time of the first workings of the Lord in me.\n\u201cDuring all this time I was never joined in profession of religion\nwith any, but gave up myself to the Lord, having forsaken all evil\ncompany, taking leave of father and mother, and all other\nrelations, and traveled up and down as a stranger on the earth,\nwhich way the Lord inclined my heart; taking a chamber to myself\nin the town where I came, and tarrying sometimes more, sometimes\nless in a place: for I durst not stay long in a place, being\nafraid both of professor and profane, lest, being a tender young\nman, I should be hurt by conversing much with either. For which\nreason I kept much as a stranger, seeking heavenly wisdom and\ngetting knowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from outward\nthings, to rely on the Lord alone. As I had forsaken the priests,\nso I left the separate preachers also, and those called the most\nexperienced people; for I saw there was none among them all that\ncould speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in\nall men were gone so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor\ncould tell what to do; then, oh then, I heard a voice which said,\n\u2018There is one, even Jesus Christ, that can speak to thy\ncondition.\u2019 When I heard it, my heart did leap for joy. Then the\nLord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak\nto my condition. I had not fellowship with any people, priests,\nnor professors, nor any sort of separated people. I was afraid of\nall carnal talk and talkers, for I could see nothing but\ncorruptions. When I was in the deep, under all shut up, I could\nnot believe that I should ever overcome; my troubles, my sorrows,\nand my temptations were so great that I often thought I should\nhave despaired, I was so tempted. But when Christ opened to me how\nhe was tempted by the same devil, and had overcome him, and had\nbruised his head; and that through him and his power, life, grace,\nand spirit, I should overcome also, I had confidence in him. If I\nhad had a king\u2019s diet, palace, and attendance, all would have been\nas nothing; for nothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power.\nI saw professors, priests, and people were whole and at ease in\nthat condition which was my misery, and they loved that which I\nwould have been rid of. But the Lord did stay my desires upon\nhimself, and my care was cast upon him alone.\u201d(197)\nA genuine first\u2010hand religious experience like this is bound to be a\nheterodoxy to its witnesses, the prophet appearing as a mere lonely\nmadman. If his doctrine prove contagious enough to spread to any others,\nit becomes a definite and labeled heresy. But if it then still prove\ncontagious enough to triumph over persecution, it becomes itself an\northodoxy; and when a religion has become an orthodoxy, its day of\ninwardness is over: the spring is dry; the faithful live at second hand\nexclusively and stone the prophets in their turn. The new church, in spite\nof whatever human goodness it may foster, can be henceforth counted on as\na staunch ally in every attempt to stifle the spontaneous religious\nspirit, and to stop all later bubblings of the fountain from which in\npurer days it drew its own supply of inspiration. Unless, indeed, by\nadopting new movements of the spirit it can make capital out of them and\nuse them for its selfish corporate designs! Of protective action of this\npolitic sort, promptly or tardily decided on, the dealings of the Roman\necclesiasticism with many individual saints and prophets yield examples\nenough for our instruction.\nThe plain fact is that men\u2019s minds are built, as has been often said, in\nwater\u2010tight compartments. Religious after a fashion, they yet have many\nother things in them beside their religion, and unholy entanglements and\nassociations inevitably obtain. The basenesses so commonly charged to\nreligion\u2019s account are thus, almost all of them, not chargeable at all to\nreligion proper, but rather to religion\u2019s wicked practical partner, the\nspirit of corporate dominion. And the bigotries are most of them in their\nturn chargeable to religion\u2019s wicked intellectual partner, the spirit of\ndogmatic dominion, the passion for laying down the law in the form of an\nabsolutely closed\u2010in theoretic system. The ecclesiastical spirit in\ngeneral is the sum of these two spirits of dominion; and I beseech you\nnever to confound the phenomena of mere tribal or corporate psychology\nwhich it presents with those manifestations of the purely interior life\nwhich are the exclusive object of our study. The baiting of Jews, the\nhunting of Albigenses and Waldenses, the stoning of Quakers and ducking of\nMethodists, the murdering of Mormons and the massacring of Armenians,\nexpress much rather that aboriginal human neophobia, that pugnacity of\nwhich we all share the vestiges, and that inborn hatred of the alien and\nof eccentric and non\u2010conforming men as aliens, than they express the\npositive piety of the various perpetrators. Piety is the mask, the inner\nforce is tribal instinct. You believe as little as I do, in spite of the\nChristian unction with which the German emperor addressed his troops upon\ntheir way to China, that the conduct which he suggested, and in which\nother Christian armies went beyond them, had anything whatever to do with\nthe interior religious life of those concerned in the performance.\nWell, no more for past atrocities than for this atrocity should we make\npiety responsible. At most we may blame piety for not availing to check\nour natural passions, and sometimes for supplying them with hypocritical\npretexts. But hypocrisy also imposes obligations, and with the pretext\nusually couples some restriction; and when the passion gust is over, the\npiety may bring a reaction of repentance which the irreligious natural man\nwould not have shown.\nFor many of the historic aberrations which have been laid to her charge,\nreligion as such, then, is not to blame. Yet of the charge that over\u2010\nzealousness or fanaticism is one of her liabilities we cannot wholly\nacquit her, so I will next make a remark upon that point. But I will\npreface it by a preliminary remark which connects itself with much that\nfollows.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOur survey of the phenomena of saintliness has unquestionably produced in\nyour minds an impression of extravagance. Is it necessary, some of you\nhave asked, as one example after another came before us, to be quite so\nfantastically good as that? We who have no vocation for the extremer\nranges of sanctity will surely be let off at the last day if our humility,\nasceticism, and devoutness prove of a less convulsive sort. This\npractically amounts to saying that much that it is legitimate to admire in\nthis field need nevertheless not be imitated, and that religious\nphenomena, like all other human phenomena, are subject to the law of the\ngolden mean. Political reformers accomplish their successive tasks in the\nhistory of nations by being blind for the time to other causes. Great\nschools of art work out the effects which it is their mission to reveal,\nat the cost of a one\u2010sidedness for which other schools must make amends.\nWe accept a John Howard, a Mazzini, a Botticelli, a Michael Angelo, with a\nkind of indulgence. We are glad they existed to show us that way, but we\nare glad there are also other ways of seeing and taking life. So of many\nof the saints whom we have looked at. We are proud of a human nature that\ncould be so passionately extreme, but we shrink from advising others to\nfollow the example. The conduct we blame ourselves for not following lies\nnearer to the middle line of human effort. It is less dependent on\nparticular beliefs and doctrines. It is such as wears well in different\nages, such as under different skies all judges are able to commend.\nThe fruits of religion, in other words, are, like all human products,\nliable to corruption by excess. Common sense must judge them. It need not\nblame the votary; but it may be able to praise him only conditionally, as\none who acts faithfully according to his lights. He shows us heroism in\none way, but the unconditionally good way is that for which no indulgence\nneed be asked.\nWe find that error by excess is exemplified by every saintly virtue.\nExcess, in human faculties, means usually one\u2010sidedness or want of\nbalance; for it is hard to imagine an essential faculty too strong, if\nonly other faculties equally strong be there to co\u00f6perate with it in\naction. Strong affections need a strong will; strong active powers need a\nstrong intellect; strong intellect needs strong sympathies, to keep life\nsteady. If the balance exist, no one faculty can possibly be too strong\u2014we\nonly get the stronger all\u2010round character. In the life of saints,\ntechnically so called, the spiritual faculties are strong, but what gives\nthe impression of extravagance proves usually on examination to be a\nrelative deficiency of intellect. Spiritual excitement takes pathological\nforms whenever other interests are too few and the intellect too narrow.\nWe find this exemplified by all the saintly attributes in turn\u2014devout love\nof God, purity, charity, asceticism, all may lead astray. I will run over\nthese virtues in succession.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nFirst of all let us take Devoutness. When unbalanced, one of its vices is\ncalled Fanaticism. Fanaticism (when not a mere expression of\necclesiastical ambition) is only loyalty carried to a convulsive extreme.\nWhen an intensely loyal and narrow mind is once grasped by the feeling\nthat a certain superhuman person is worthy of its exclusive devotion, one\nof the first things that happens is that it idealizes the devotion itself.\nTo adequately realize the merits of the idol gets to be considered the one\ngreat merit of the worshiper; and the sacrifices and servilities by which\nsavage tribesmen have from time immemorial exhibited their faithfulness to\nchieftains are now outbid in favor of the deity. Vocabularies are\nexhausted and languages altered in the attempt to praise him enough; death\nis looked on as gain if it attract his grateful notice; and the personal\nattitude of being his devotee becomes what one might almost call a new and\nexalted kind of professional specialty within the tribe.(198) The legends\nthat gather round the lives of holy persons are fruits of this impulse to\ncelebrate and glorify. The Buddha(199) and Mohammed(200) and their\ncompanions and many Christian saints are incrusted with a heavy jewelry of\nanecdotes which are meant to be honorific, but are simply _abgeschmackt_\nand silly, and form a touching expression of man\u2019s misguided propensity to\npraise.\nAn immediate consequence of this condition of mind is jealousy for the\ndeity\u2019s honor. How can the devotee show his loyalty better than by\nsensitiveness in this regard? The slightest affront or neglect must be\nresented, the deity\u2019s enemies must be put to shame. In exceedingly narrow\nminds and active wills, such a care may become an engrossing\npreoccupation; and crusades have been preached and massacres instigated\nfor no other reason than to remove a fancied slight upon the God.\nTheologies representing the gods as mindful of their glory, and churches\nwith imperialistic policies, have conspired to fan this temper to a glow,\nso that intolerance and persecution have come to be vices associated by\nsome of us inseparably with the saintly mind. They are unquestionably its\nbesetting sins. The saintly temper is a moral temper, and a moral temper\nhas often to be cruel. It is a partisan temper, and that is cruel. Between\nhis own and Jehovah\u2019s enemies a David knows no difference; a Catherine of\nSiena, panting to stop the warfare among Christians which was the scandal\nof her epoch, can think of no better method of union among them than a\ncrusade to massacre the Turks; Luther finds no word of protest or regret\nover the atrocious tortures with which the Anabaptist leaders were put to\ndeath; and a Cromwell praises the Lord for delivering his enemies into his\nhands for \u201cexecution.\u201d Politics come in in all such cases; but piety finds\nthe partnership not quite unnatural. So, when \u201cfreethinkers\u201d tell us that\nreligion and fanaticism are twins, we cannot make an unqualified denial of\nthe charge.\nFanaticism must then be inscribed on the wrong side of religion\u2019s account,\nso long as the religious person\u2019s intellect is on the stage which the\ndespotic kind of God satisfies. But as soon as the God is represented as\nless intent on his own honor and glory, it ceases to be a danger.\nFanaticism is found only where the character is masterful and aggressive.\nIn gentle characters, where devoutness is intense and the intellect\nfeeble, we have an imaginative absorption in the love of God to the\nexclusion of all practical human interests, which, though innocent enough,\nis too one\u2010sided to be admirable. A mind too narrow has room but for one\nkind of affection. When the love of God takes possession of such a mind,\nit expels all human loves and human uses. There is no English name for\nsuch a sweet excess of devotion, so I will refer to it as a _theopathic_\ncondition.\nThe blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque may serve as an example.\n\u201cTo be loved here upon the earth,\u201d her recent biographer exclaims:\n\u201cto be loved by a noble, elevated, distinguished being; to be\nloved with fidelity, with devotion,\u2014what enchantment! But to be\nloved by God! and loved by him to distraction [aim\u00e9 jusq\u00f9\u2019\u00e0 la\nfolie]!\u2014Margaret melted away with love at the thought of such a\nthing. Like Saint Philip of Neri in former times, or like Saint\nFrancis Xavier, she said to God: \u2018Hold back, O my God, these\ntorrents which overwhelm me, or else enlarge my capacity for their\nreception.\u2019 \u201d(201)\nThe most signal proofs of God\u2019s love which Margaret Mary received\nwere her hallucinations of sight, touch, and hearing, and the most\nsignal in turn of these were the revelations of Christ\u2019s sacred\nheart, \u201csurrounded with rays more brilliant than the Sun, and\ntransparent like a crystal. The wound which he received on the\ncross visibly appeared upon it. There was a crown of thorns round\nabout this divine Heart, and a cross above it.\u201d At the same time\nChrist\u2019s voice told her that, unable longer to contain the flames\nof his love for mankind, he had chosen her by a miracle to spread\nthe knowledge of them. He thereupon took out her mortal heart,\nplaced it inside of his own and inflamed it, and then replaced it\nin her breast, adding: \u201cHitherto thou hast taken the name of my\nslave, hereafter thou shalt be called the well\u2010beloved disciple of\nmy Sacred Heart.\u201d\nIn a later vision the Saviour revealed to her in detail the \u201cgreat\ndesign\u201d which he wished to establish through her instrumentality.\n\u201cI ask of thee to bring it about that every first Friday after the\nweek of holy Sacrament shall be made into a special holy day for\nhonoring my Heart by a general communion and by services intended\nto make honorable amends for the indignities which it has\nreceived. And I promise thee that my Heart will dilate to shed\nwith abundance the influences of its love upon all those who pay\nto it these honors, or who bring it about that others do the\nsame.\u201d\n\u201cThis revelation,\u201d says Mgr. Bougaud, \u201cis unquestionably the most\nimportant of all the revelations which have illumined the Church since\nthat of the Incarnation and of the Lord\u2019s Supper.... After the Eucharist,\nthe supreme effort of the Sacred Heart.\u201d(202) Well, what were its good\nfruits for Margaret Mary\u2019s life? Apparently little else but sufferings and\nprayers and absences of mind and swoons and ecstasies. She became\nincreasingly useless about the convent, her absorption in Christ\u2019s love,\u2014\n\u201cwhich grew upon her daily, rendering her more and more incapable\nof attending to external duties. They tried her in the infirmary,\nbut without much success, although her kindness, zeal, and\ndevotion were without bounds, and her charity rose to acts of such\na heroism that our readers would not bear the recital of them.\nThey tried her in the kitchen, but were forced to give it up as\nhopeless\u2014everything dropped out of her hands. The admirable\nhumility with which she made amends for her clumsiness could not\nprevent this from being prejudicial to the order and regularity\nwhich must always reign in a community. They put her in the\nschool, where the little girls cherished her, and cut pieces out\nof her clothes [for relics] as if she were already a saint, but\nwhere she was too absorbed inwardly to pay the necessary\nattention. Poor dear sister, even less after her visions than\nbefore them was she a denizen of earth, and they had to leave her\nin her heaven.\u201d(203)\nPoor dear sister, indeed! Amiable and good, but so feeble of intellectual\noutlook that it would be too much to ask of us, with our Protestant and\nmodern education, to feel anything but indulgent pity for the kind of\nsaintship which she embodies. A lower example still of theopathic\nsaintliness is that of Saint Gertrude, a Benedictine nun of the thirteenth\ncentury, whose \u201cRevelations,\u201d a well\u2010known mystical authority, consist\nmainly of proofs of Christ\u2019s partiality for her undeserving person.\nAssurances of his love, intimacies and caresses and compliments of the\nmost absurd and puerile sort, addressed by Christ to Gertrude as an\nindividual, form the tissue of this paltry\u2010minded recital.(204) In reading\nsuch a narrative, we realize the gap between the thirteenth and the\ntwentieth century, and we feel that saintliness of character may yield\nalmost absolutely worthless fruits if it be associated with such inferior\nintellectual sympathies. What with science, idealism, and democracy, our\nown imagination has grown to need a God of an entirely different\ntemperament from that Being interested exclusively in dealing out personal\nfavors, with whom our ancestors were so contented. Smitten as we are with\nthe vision of social righteousness, a God indifferent to everything but\nadulation, and full of partiality for his individual favorites, lacks an\nessential element of largeness; and even the best professional sainthood\nof former centuries, pent in as it is to such a conception, seems to us\ncuriously shallow and unedifying.\nTake Saint Teresa, for example, one of the ablest women, in many respects,\nof whose life we have the record. She had a powerful intellect of the\npractical order. She wrote admirable descriptive psychology, possessed a\nwill equal to any emergency, great talent for politics and business, a\nbuoyant disposition, and a first\u2010rate literary style. She was tenaciously\naspiring, and put her whole life at the service of her religious ideals.\nYet so paltry were these, according to our present way of thinking, that\n(although I know that others have been moved differently) I confess that\nmy only feeling in reading her has been pity that so much vitality of soul\nshould have found such poor employment.\nIn spite of the sufferings which she endured, there is a curious flavor of\nsuperficiality about her genius. A Birmingham anthropologist, Dr. Jordan,\nhas divided the human race into two types, whom he calls \u201cshrews\u201d and\n\u201cnon\u2010shrews\u201d respectively.(205) The shrew\u2010type is defined as possessing an\n\u201cactive unimpassioned temperament.\u201d In other words, shrews are the\n\u201cmotors,\u201d rather than the \u201csensories,\u201d(206) and their expressions are as a\nrule more energetic than the feelings which appear to prompt them. Saint\nTeresa, paradoxical as such a judgment may sound, was a typical shrew, in\nthis sense of the term. The bustle of her style, as well as of her life,\nproves it. Not only must she receive unheard\u2010of personal favors and\nspiritual graces from her Saviour, but she must immediately write about\nthem and _exploiter_ them professionally, and use her expertness to give\ninstruction to those less privileged. Her voluble egotism; her sense, not\nof radical bad being, as the really contrite have it, but of her \u201cfaults\u201d\nand \u201cimperfections\u201d in the plural; her stereotyped humility and return\nupon herself, as covered with \u201cconfusion\u201d at each new manifestation of\nGod\u2019s singular partiality for a person so unworthy, are typical of\nshrewdom: a paramountly feeling nature would be objectively lost in\ngratitude, and silent. She had some public instincts, it is true; she\nhated the Lutherans, and longed for the church\u2019s triumph over them; but in\nthe main her idea of religion seems to have been that of an endless\namatory flirtation\u2014if one may say so without irreverence\u2014between the\ndevotee and the deity; and apart from helping younger nuns to go in this\ndirection by the inspiration of her example and instruction, there is\nabsolutely no human use in her, or sign of any general human interest. Yet\nthe spirit of her age, far from rebuking her, exalted her as superhuman.\nWe have to pass a similar judgment on the whole notion of saintship based\non merits. Any God who, on the one hand, can care to keep a pedantically\nminute account of individual shortcomings, and on the other can feel such\npartialities, and load particular creatures with such insipid marks of\nfavor, is too small\u2010minded a God for our credence. When Luther, in his\nimmense manly way, swept off by a stroke of his hand the very notion of a\ndebit and credit account kept with individuals by the Almighty, he\nstretched the soul\u2019s imagination and saved theology from puerility.\nSo much for mere devotion, divorced from the intellectual conceptions\nwhich might guide it towards bearing useful human fruit.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next saintly virtue in which we find excess is Purity. In theopathic\ncharacters, like those whom we have just considered, the love of God must\nnot be mixed with any other love. Father and mother, sisters, brothers,\nand friends are felt as interfering distractions; for sensitiveness and\nnarrowness, when they occur together, as they often do, require above all\nthings a simplified world to dwell in. Variety and confusion are too much\nfor their powers of comfortable adaptation. But whereas your aggressive\npietist reaches his unity objectively, by forcibly stamping disorder and\ndivergence out, your retiring pietist reaches his subjectively, leaving\ndisorder in the world at large, but making a smaller world in which he\ndwells himself and from which he eliminates it altogether. Thus, alongside\nof the church militant with its prisons, dragonnades, and inquisition\nmethods, we have the church _fugient_, as one might call it, with its\nhermitages, monasteries, and sectarian organizations, both churches\npursuing the same object\u2014to unify the life,(207) and simplify the\nspectacle presented to the soul. A mind extremely sensitive to inner\ndiscords will drop one external relation after another, as interfering\nwith the absorption of consciousness in spiritual things. Amusements must\ngo first, then conventional \u201csociety,\u201d then business, then family duties,\nuntil at last seclusion, with a subdivision of the day into hours for\nstated religious acts, is the only thing that can be borne. The lives of\nsaints are a history of successive renunciations of complication, one form\nof contact with the outer life being dropped after another, to save the\npurity of inner tone.(208) \u201cIs it not better,\u201d a young sister asks her\nSuperior, \u201cthat I should not speak at all during the hour of recreation,\nso as not to run the risk, by speaking, of falling into some sin of which\nI might not be conscious?\u201d(209) If the life remains a social one at all,\nthose who take part in it must follow one identical rule. Embosomed in\nthis monotony, the zealot for purity feels clean and free once more. The\nminuteness of uniformity maintained in certain sectarian communities,\nwhether monastic or not, is something almost inconceivable to a man of the\nworld. Costume, phraseology, hours, and habits are absolutely stereotyped,\nand there is no doubt that some persons are so made as to find in this\nstability an incomparable kind of mental rest.\nWe have no time to multiply examples, so I will let the case of Saint\nLouis of Gonzaga serve as a type of excess in purification. I think you\nwill agree that this youth carried the elimination of the external and\ndiscordant to a point which we cannot unreservedly admire. At the age of\nten, his biographer says:\u2014\n\u201cThe inspiration came to him to consecrate to the Mother of God\nhis own virginity\u2014that being to her the most agreeable of possible\npresents. Without delay, then, and with all the fervor there was\nin him, joyous of heart, and burning with love, he made his vow of\nperpetual chastity. Mary accepted the offering of his innocent\nheart, and obtained for him from God, as a recompense, the\nextraordinary grace of never feeling during his entire life the\nslightest touch of temptation against the virtue of purity. This\nwas an altogether exceptional favor, rarely accorded even to\nSaints themselves, and all the more marvelous in that Louis dwelt\nalways in courts and among great folks, where danger and\nopportunity are so unusually frequent. It is true that Louis from\nhis earliest childhood had shown a natural repugnance for whatever\nmight be impure or unvirginal, and even for relations of any sort\nwhatever between persons of opposite sex. But this made it all the\nmore surprising that he should, especially since this vow, feel it\nnecessary to have recourse to such a number of expedients for\nprotecting against even the shadow of danger the virginity which\nhe had thus consecrated. One might suppose that if any one could\nhave contented himself with the ordinary precautions, prescribed\nfor all Christians, it would assuredly have been he. But no! In\nthe use of preservatives and means of defense, in flight from the\nmost insignificant occasions, from every possibility of peril,\njust as in the mortification of his flesh, he went farther than\nthe majority of saints. He, who by an extraordinary protection of\nGod\u2019s grace was never tempted, measured all his steps as if he\nwere threatened on every side by particular dangers. Thenceforward\nhe never raised his eyes, either when walking in the streets, or\nwhen in society. Not only did he avoid all business with females\neven more scrupulously than before, but he renounced all\nconversation and every kind of social recreation with them,\nalthough his father tried to make him take part; and he commenced\nonly too early to deliver his innocent body to austerities of\nevery kind.\u201d(210)\nAt the age of twelve, we read of this young man that \u201cif by chance his\nmother sent one of her maids of honor to him with a message, he never\nallowed her to come in, but listened to her through the barely opened\ndoor, and dismissed her immediately. He did not like to be alone with his\nown mother, whether at table or in conversation; and when the rest of the\ncompany withdrew, he sought also a pretext for retiring.... Several great\nladies, relatives of his, he avoided learning to know even by sight; and\nhe made a sort of treaty with his father, engaging promptly and readily to\naccede to all his wishes, if he might only be excused from all visits to\nladies.\u201d (Ibid., p. 71.)\nWhen he was seventeen years old Louis joined the Jesuit order(211) against\nhis father\u2019s passionate entreaties, for he was heir of a princely house;\nand when a year later the father died, he took the loss as a \u201cparticular\nattention\u201d to himself on God\u2019s part, and wrote letters of stilted good\nadvice, as from a spiritual superior, to his grieving mother. He soon\nbecame so good a monk that if any one asked him the number of his brothers\nand sisters, he had to reflect and count them over before replying. A\nFather asked him one day if he were never troubled by the thought of his\nfamily, to which, \u201cI never think of them except when praying for them,\u201d\nwas his only answer. Never was he seen to hold in his hand a flower or\nanything perfumed, that he might take pleasure in it. On the contrary, in\nthe hospital, he used to seek for whatever was most disgusting, and\neagerly snatch the bandages of ulcers, etc., from the hands of his\ncompanions. He avoided worldly talk, and immediately tried to turn every\nconversation on to pious subjects, or else he remained silent. He\nsystematically refused to notice his surroundings. Being ordered one day\nto bring a book from the rector\u2019s seat in the refectory, he had to ask\nwhere the rector sat, for in the three months he had eaten bread there, so\ncarefully did he guard his eyes that he had not noticed the place. One\nday, during recess, having looked by chance on one of his companions, he\nreproached himself as for a grave sin against modesty. He cultivated\nsilence, as preserving from sins of the tongue; and his greatest penance\nwas the limit which his superiors set to his bodily penances. He sought\nafter false accusations and unjust reprimands as opportunities of\nhumility; and such was his obedience that, when a room\u2010mate, having no\nmore paper, asked him for a sheet, he did not feel free to give it to him\nwithout first obtaining the permission of the superior, who, as such,\nstood in the place of God, and transmitted his orders.\nI can find no other sorts of fruit than these of Louis\u2019s saintship. He\ndied in 1591, in his twenty\u2010ninth year, and is known in the Church as the\npatron of all young people. On his festival, the altar in the chapel\ndevoted to him in a certain church in Rome \u201cis embosomed in flowers,\narranged with exquisite taste; and a pile of letters may be seen at its\nfoot, written to the Saint by young men and women, and directed to\n\u2018Paradiso.\u2019 They are supposed to be burnt unread except by San Luigi, who\nmust find singular petitions in these pretty little missives, tied up now\nwith a green ribbon, expressive of hope, now with a red one, emblematic of\nlove,\u201d etc.(212)\nOur final judgment of the worth of such a life as this will depend largely\non our conception of God, and of the sort of conduct he is best pleased\nwith in his creatures. The Catholicism of the sixteenth century paid\nlittle heed to social righteousness; and to leave the world to the devil\nwhilst saving one\u2019s own soul was then accounted no discreditable scheme.\nTo\u2010day, rightly or wrongly, helpfulness in general human affairs is, in\nconsequence of one of those secular mutations in moral sentiment of which\nI spoke, deemed an essential element of worth in character; and to be of\nsome public or private use is also reckoned as a species of divine\nservice. Other early Jesuits, especially the missionaries among them, the\nXaviers, Br\u00e9beufs, Jogues, were objective minds, and fought in their way\nfor the world\u2019s welfare; so their lives to\u2010day inspire us. But when the\nintellect, as in this Louis, is originally no larger than a pin\u2019s head,\nand cherishes ideas of God of corresponding smallness, the result,\nnotwithstanding the heroism put forth, is on the whole repulsive. Purity,\nwe see in the object\u2010lesson, is _not_ the one thing needful; and it is\nbetter that a life should contract many a dirt\u2010mark, than forfeit\nusefulness in its efforts to remain unspotted.\nProceeding onwards in our search of religious extravagance, we next come\nupon excesses of Tenderness and Charity. Here saintliness has to face the\ncharge of preserving the unfit, and breeding parasites and beggars.\n\u201cResist not evil,\u201d \u201cLove your enemies,\u201d these are saintly maxims of which\nmen of this world find it hard to speak without impatience. Are the men of\nthis world right, or are the saints in possession of the deeper range of\ntruth?\nNo simple answer is possible. Here, if anywhere, one feels the complexity\nof the moral life, and the mysteriousness of the way in which facts and\nideals are interwoven.\nPerfect conduct is a relation between three terms: the actor, the objects\nfor which he acts, and the recipients of the action. In order that conduct\nshould be abstractly perfect, all three terms, intention, execution, and\nreception, should be suited to one another. The best intention will fail\nif it either work by false means or address itself to the wrong recipient.\nThus no critic or estimator of the value of conduct can confine himself to\nthe actor\u2019s animus alone, apart from the other elements of the\nperformance. As there is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood by those\nwho hear it, so reasonable arguments, challenges to magnanimity, and\nappeals to sympathy or justice, are folly when we are dealing with human\ncrocodiles and boa\u2010constrictors. The saint may simply give the universe\ninto the hands of the enemy by his trustfulness. He may by non\u2010resistance\ncut off his own survival.\nHerbert Spencer tells us that the perfect man\u2019s conduct will appear\nperfect only when the environment is perfect: to no inferior environment\nis it suitably adapted. We may paraphrase this by cordially admitting that\nsaintly conduct would be the most perfect conduct conceivable in an\nenvironment where all were saints already; but by adding that in an\nenvironment where few are saints, and many the exact reverse of saints, it\nmust be ill adapted. We must frankly confess, then, using our empirical\ncommon sense and ordinary practical prejudices, that in the world that\nactually is, the virtues of sympathy, charity, and non\u2010resistance may be,\nand often have been, manifested in excess. The powers of darkness have\nsystematically taken advantage of them. The whole modern scientific\norganization of charity is a consequence of the failure of simply giving\nalms. The whole history of constitutional government is a commentary on\nthe excellence of resisting evil, and when one cheek is smitten, of\nsmiting back and not turning the other cheek also.\nYou will agree to this in general, for in spite of the Gospel, in spite of\nQuakerism, in spite of Tolstoi, you believe in fighting fire with fire, in\nshooting down usurpers, locking up thieves, and freezing out vagabonds and\nswindlers.\nAnd yet you are sure, as I am sure, that were the world confined to these\nhard\u2010headed, hard\u2010hearted, and hard\u2010fisted methods exclusively, were there\nno one prompt to help a brother first, and find out afterwards whether he\nwere worthy; no one willing to drown his private wrongs in pity for the\nwronger\u2019s person; no one ready to be duped many a time rather than live\nalways on suspicion; no one glad to treat individuals passionately and\nimpulsively rather than by general rules of prudence; the world would be\nan infinitely worse place than it is now to live in. The tender grace, not\nof a day that is dead, but of a day yet to be born somehow, with the\ngolden rule grown natural, would be cut out from the perspective of our\nimaginations.\nThe saints, existing in this way, may, with their extravagances of human\ntenderness, be prophetic. Nay, innumerable times they have proved\nthemselves prophetic. Treating those whom they met, in spite of the past,\nin spite of all appearances, as worthy, they have stimulated them to _be_\nworthy, miraculously transformed them by their radiant example and by the\nchallenge of their expectation.\nFrom this point of view we may admit the human charity which we find in\nall saints, and the great excess of it which we find in some saints, to be\na genuinely creative social force, tending to make real a degree of virtue\nwhich it alone is ready to assume as possible. The saints are authors,\n_auctores_, increasers, of goodness. The potentialities of development in\nhuman souls are unfathomable. So many who seemed irretrievably hardened\nhave in point of fact been softened, converted, regenerated, in ways that\namazed the subjects even more than they surprised the spectators, that we\nnever can be sure in advance of any man that his salvation by the way of\nlove is hopeless. We have no right to speak of human crocodiles and boa\u2010\nconstrictors as of fixedly incurable beings. We know not the complexities\nof personality, the smouldering emotional fires, the other facets of the\ncharacter\u2010polyhedron, the resources of the subliminal region. St. Paul\nlong ago made our ancestors familiar with the idea that every soul is\nvirtually sacred. Since Christ died for us all without exception, St. Paul\nsaid, we must despair of no one. This belief in the essential sacredness\nof every one expresses itself to\u2010day in all sorts of humane customs and\nreformatory institutions, and in a growing aversion to the death penalty\nand to brutality in punishment. The saints, with their extravagance of\nhuman tenderness, are the great torch\u2010bearers of this belief, the tip of\nthe wedge, the clearers of the darkness. Like the single drops which\nsparkle in the sun as they are flung far ahead of the advancing edge of a\nwave\u2010crest or of a flood, they show the way and are forerunners. The world\nis not yet with them, so they often seem in the midst of the world\u2019s\naffairs to be preposterous. Yet they are impregnators of the world,\nvivifiers and animaters of potentialities of goodness which but for them\nwould lie forever dormant. It is not possible to be quite as mean as we\nnaturally are, when they have passed before us. One fire kindles another;\nand without that over\u2010trust in human worth which they show, the rest of us\nwould lie in spiritual stagnancy.\nMomentarily considered, then, the saint may waste his tenderness and be\nthe dupe and victim of his charitable fever, but the general function of\nhis charity in social evolution is vital and essential. If things are ever\nto move upward, some one must be ready to take the first step, and assume\nthe risk of it. No one who is not willing to try charity, to try non\u2010\nresistance as the saint is always willing, can tell whether these methods\nwill or will not succeed. When they do succeed, they are far more\npowerfully successful than force or worldly prudence. Force destroys\nenemies; and the best that can be said of prudence is that it keeps what\nwe already have in safety. But non\u2010resistance, when successful, turns\nenemies into friends; and charity regenerates its objects. These saintly\nmethods are, as I said, creative energies; and genuine saints find in the\nelevated excitement with which their faith endows them an authority and\nimpressiveness which makes them irresistible in situations where men of\nshallower nature cannot get on at all without the use of worldly prudence.\nThis practical proof that worldly wisdom may be safely transcended is the\nsaint\u2019s magic gift to mankind.(213) Not only does his vision of a better\nworld console us for the generally prevailing prose and barrenness; but\neven when on the whole we have to confess him ill adapted, he makes some\nconverts, and the environment gets better for his ministry. He is an\neffective ferment of goodness, a slow transmuter of the earthly into a\nmore heavenly order.\nIn this respect the Utopian dreams of social justice in which many\ncontemporary socialists and anarchists indulge are, in spite of their\nimpracticability and non\u2010adaptation to present environmental conditions,\nanalogous to the saint\u2019s belief in an existent kingdom of heaven. They\nhelp to break the edge of the general reign of hardness, and are slow\nleavens of a better order.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next topic in order is Asceticism, which I fancy you are all ready to\nconsider without argument a virtue liable to extravagance and excess. The\noptimism and refinement of the modern imagination has, as I have already\nsaid elsewhere, changed the attitude of the church towards corporeal\nmortification, and a Suso or a Saint Peter of Alcantara(214) appear to us\nto\u2010day rather in the light of tragic mountebanks than of sane men\ninspiring us with respect. If the inner dispositions are right, we ask,\nwhat need of all this torment, this violation of the outer nature? It\nkeeps the outer nature too important. Any one who is genuinely emancipated\nfrom the flesh will look on pleasures and pains, abundance and privation,\nas alike irrelevant and indifferent. He can engage in actions and\nexperience enjoyments without fear of corruption or enslavement. As the\nBhagavad\u2010Gita says, only those need renounce worldly actions who are still\ninwardly attached thereto. If one be really unattached to the fruits of\naction, one may mix in the world with equanimity. I quoted in a former\nlecture Saint Augustine\u2019s antinomian saying: If you only love God enough,\nyou may safely follow all your inclinations. \u201cHe needs no devotional\npractices,\u201d is one of Ramakrishna\u2019s maxims, \u201cwhose heart is moved to tears\nat the mere mention of the name of Hari.\u201d(215) And the Buddha, in pointing\nout what he called \u201cthe middle way\u201d to his disciples, told them to abstain\nfrom both extremes, excessive mortification being as unreal and unworthy\nas mere desire and pleasure. The only perfect life, he said, is that of\ninner wisdom, which makes one thing as indifferent to us as another, and\nthus leads to rest, to peace, and to Nirv\u00e2na.(216)\nWe find accordingly that as ascetic saints have grown older, and directors\nof conscience more experienced, they usually have shown a tendency to lay\nless stress on special bodily mortifications. Catholic teachers have\nalways professed the rule that, since health is needed for efficiency in\nGod\u2019s service, health must not be sacrificed to mortification. The general\noptimism and healthy\u2010mindedness of liberal Protestant circles to\u2010day makes\nmortification for mortification\u2019s sake repugnant to us. We can no longer\nsympathize with cruel deities, and the notion that God can take delight in\nthe spectacle of sufferings self\u2010inflicted in his honor is abhorrent. In\nconsequence of all these motives you probably are disposed, unless some\nspecial utility can be shown in some individual\u2019s discipline, to treat the\ngeneral tendency to asceticism as pathological.\nYet I believe that a more careful consideration of the whole matter,\ndistinguishing between the general good intention of asceticism and the\nuselessness of some of the particular acts of which it may be guilty,\nought to rehabilitate it in our esteem. For in its spiritual meaning\nasceticism stands for nothing less than for the essence of the twice\u2010born\nphilosophy. It symbolizes, lamely enough no doubt, but sincerely, the\nbelief that there is an element of real wrongness in this world, which is\nneither to be ignored nor evaded, but which must be squarely met and\novercome by an appeal to the soul\u2019s heroic resources, and neutralized and\ncleansed away by suffering. As against this view, the ultra\u2010optimistic\nform of the once\u2010born philosophy thinks we may treat evil by the method of\nignoring. Let a man who, by fortunate health and circumstances, escapes\nthe suffering of any great amount of evil in his own person, also close\nhis eyes to it as it exists in the wider universe outside his private\nexperience, and he will be quit of it altogether, and can sail through\nlife happily on a healthy\u2010minded basis. But we saw in our lectures on\nmelancholy how precarious this attempt necessarily is. Moreover it is but\nfor the individual; and leaves the evil outside of him, unredeemed and\nunprovided for in his philosophy.\nNo such attempt can be a _general_ solution of the problem; and to minds\nof sombre tinge, who naturally feel life as a tragic mystery, such\noptimism is a shallow dodge or mean evasion. It accepts, in lieu of a real\ndeliverance, what is a lucky personal accident merely, a cranny to escape\nby. It leaves the general world unhelped and still in the clutch of Satan.\nThe real deliverance, the twice\u2010born folk insist, must be of universal\napplication. Pain and wrong and death must be fairly met and overcome in\nhigher excitement, or else their sting remains essentially unbroken. If\none has ever taken the fact of the prevalence of tragic death in this\nworld\u2019s history fairly into his mind,\u2014freezing, drowning, entombment\nalive, wild beasts, worse men, and hideous diseases,\u2014he can with\ndifficulty, it seems to me, continue his own career of worldly prosperity\nwithout suspecting that he may all the while not be really inside the\ngame, that he may lack the great initiation.\nWell, this is exactly what asceticism thinks; and it voluntarily takes the\ninitiation. Life is neither farce nor genteel comedy, it says, but\nsomething we must sit at in mourning garments, hoping its bitter taste\nwill purge us of our folly. The wild and the heroic are indeed such rooted\nparts of it that healthy\u2010mindedness pure and simple, with its sentimental\noptimism, can hardly be regarded by any thinking man as a serious\nsolution. Phrases of neatness, cosiness, and comfort can never be an\nanswer to the sphinx\u2019s riddle.\nIn these remarks I am leaning only upon mankind\u2019s common instinct for\nreality, which in point of fact has always held the world to be\nessentially a theatre for heroism. In heroism, we feel, life\u2019s supreme\nmystery is hidden. We tolerate no one who has no capacity whatever for it\nin any direction. On the other hand, no matter what a man\u2019s frailties\notherwise may be, if he be willing to risk death, and still more if he\nsuffer it heroically, in the service he has chosen, the fact consecrates\nhim forever. Inferior to ourselves in this or that way, if yet we cling to\nlife, and he is able \u201cto fling it away like a flower\u201d as caring nothing\nfor it, we account him in the deepest way our born superior. Each of us in\nhis own person feels that a high\u2010hearted indifference to life would\nexpiate all his shortcomings.\nThe metaphysical mystery, thus recognized by common sense, that he who\nfeeds on death that feeds on men possesses life supereminently and\nexcellently, and meets best the secret demands of the universe, is the\ntruth of which asceticism has been the faithful champion. The folly of the\ncross, so inexplicable by the intellect, has yet its indestructible vital\nmeaning.\nRepresentatively, then, and symbolically, and apart from the vagaries into\nwhich the unenlightened intellect of former times may have let it wander,\nasceticism must, I believe, be acknowledged to go with the profounder way\nof handling the gift of existence. Naturalistic optimism is mere syllabub\nand flattery and sponge\u2010cake in comparison. The practical course of action\nfor us, as religious men, would therefore, it seems to me, not be simply\nto turn our backs upon the ascetic impulse, as most of us to\u2010day turn\nthem, but rather to discover some outlet for it of which the fruits in the\nway of privation and hardship might be objectively useful. The older\nmonastic asceticism occupied itself with pathetic futilities, or\nterminated in the mere egotism of the individual, increasing his own\nperfection.(217) But is it not possible for us to discard most of these\nolder forms of mortification, and yet find saner channels for the heroism\nwhich inspired them?\nDoes not, for example, the worship of material luxury and wealth, which\nconstitutes so large a portion of the \u201cspirit\u201d of our age, make somewhat\nfor effeminacy and unmanliness? Is not the exclusively sympathetic and\nfacetious way in which most children are brought up to\u2010day\u2014so different\nfrom the education of a hundred years ago, especially in evangelical\ncircles\u2014in danger, in spite of its many advantages, of developing a\ncertain trashiness of fibre? Are there not hereabouts some points of\napplication for a renovated and revised ascetic discipline?\nMany of you would recognize such dangers, but would point to athletics,\nmilitarism, and individual and national enterprise and adventure as the\nremedies. These contemporary ideals are quite as remarkable for the energy\nwith which they make for heroic standards of life, as contemporary\nreligion is remarkable for the way in which it neglects them.(218) War and\nadventure assuredly keep all who engage in them from treating themselves\ntoo tenderly. They demand such incredible efforts, depth beyond depth of\nexertion, both in degree and in duration, that the whole scale of\nmotivation alters. Discomfort and annoyance, hunger and wet, pain and\ncold, squalor and filth, cease to have any deterrent operation whatever.\nDeath turns into a commonplace matter, and its usual power to check our\naction vanishes. With the annulling of these customary inhibitions, ranges\nof new energy are set free, and life seems cast upon a higher plane of\npower.\nThe beauty of war in this respect is that it is so congruous with ordinary\nhuman nature. Ancestral evolution has made us all potential warriors; so\nthe most insignificant individual, when thrown into an army in the field,\nis weaned from whatever excess of tenderness towards his precious person\nhe may bring with him, and may easily develop into a monster of\ninsensibility.\nBut when we compare the military type of self\u2010severity with that of the\nascetic saint, we find a world\u2010wide difference in all their spiritual\nconcomitants.\n\u201c \u2018Live and let live,\u2019 \u201d writes a clear\u2010headed Austrian officer, \u201cis no\ndevice for an army. Contempt for one\u2019s own comrades, for the troops of the\nenemy, and, above all, fierce contempt for one\u2019s own person, are what war\ndemands of every one. Far better is it for an army to be too savage, too\ncruel, too barbarous, than to possess too much sentimentality and human\nreasonableness. If the soldier is to be good for anything as a soldier, he\nmust be exactly the opposite of a reasoning and thinking man. The measure\nof goodness in him is his possible use in war. War, and even peace,\nrequire of the soldier absolutely peculiar standards of morality. The\nrecruit brings with him common moral notions, of which he must seek\nimmediately to get rid. For him victory, success, must be _everything_.\nThe most barbaric tendencies in men come to life again in war, and for\nwar\u2019s uses they are incommensurably good.\u201d(219)\nThese words are of course literally true. The immediate aim of the\nsoldier\u2019s life is, as Moltke said, destruction, and nothing but\ndestruction; and whatever constructions wars result in are remote and non\u2010\nmilitary. Consequently the soldier cannot train himself to be too\nfeelingless to all those usual sympathies and respects, whether for\npersons or for things, that make for conservation. Yet the fact remains\nthat war is a school of strenuous life and heroism; and, being in the line\nof aboriginal instinct, is the only school that as yet is universally\navailable. But when we gravely ask ourselves whether this wholesale\norganization of irrationality and crime be our only bulwark against\neffeminacy, we stand aghast at the thought, and think more kindly of\nascetic religion. One hears of the mechanical equivalent of heat. What we\nnow need to discover in the social realm is the moral equivalent of war:\nsomething heroic that will speak to men as universally as war does, and\nyet will be as compatible with their spiritual selves as war has proved\nitself to be incompatible. I have often thought that in the old monkish\npoverty\u2010worship, in spite of the pedantry which infested it, there might\nbe something like that moral equivalent of war which we are seeking. May\nnot voluntarily accepted poverty be \u201cthe strenuous life,\u201d without the need\nof crushing weaker peoples?\nPoverty indeed _is_ the strenuous life,\u2014without brass bands or uniforms or\nhysteric popular applause or lies or circumlocutions; and when one sees\nthe way in which wealth\u2010getting enters as an ideal into the very bone and\nmarrow of our generation, one wonders whether a revival of the belief that\npoverty is a worthy religious vocation may not be \u201cthe transformation of\nmilitary courage,\u201d and the spiritual reform which our time stands most in\nneed of.\nAmong us English\u2010speaking peoples especially do the praises of poverty\nneed once more to be boldly sung. We have grown literally afraid to be\npoor. We despise any one who elects to be poor in order to simplify and\nsave his inner life. If he does not join the general scramble and pant\nwith the money\u2010making street, we deem him spiritless and lacking in\nambition. We have lost the power even of imagining what the ancient\nidealization of poverty could have meant: the liberation from material\nattachments, the unbribed soul, the manlier indifference, the paying our\nway by what we are or do and not by what we have, the right to fling away\nour life at any moment irresponsibly,\u2014the more athletic trim, in short,\nthe moral fighting shape. When we of the so\u2010called better classes are\nscared as men were never scared in history at material ugliness and\nhardship; when we put off marriage until our house can be artistic, and\nquake at the thought of having a child without a bank\u2010account and doomed\nto manual labor, it is time for thinking men to protest against so unmanly\nand irreligious a state of opinion.\nIt is true that so far as wealth gives time for ideal ends and exercise to\nideal energies, wealth is better than poverty and ought to be chosen. But\nwealth does this in only a portion of the actual cases. Elsewhere the\ndesire to gain wealth and the fear to lose it are our chief breeders of\ncowardice and propagators of corruption. There are thousands of\nconjunctures in which a wealth\u2010bound man must be a slave, whilst a man for\nwhom poverty has no terrors becomes a freeman. Think of the strength which\npersonal indifference to poverty would give us if we were devoted to\nunpopular causes. We need no longer hold our tongues or fear to vote the\nrevolutionary or reformatory ticket. Our stocks might fall, our hopes of\npromotion vanish, our salaries stop, our club doors close in our faces;\nyet, while we lived, we would imperturbably bear witness to the spirit,\nand our example would help to set free our generation. The cause would\nneed its funds, but we its servants would be potent in proportion as we\npersonally were contented with our poverty.\nI recommend this matter to your serious pondering, for it is certain that\nthe prevalent fear of poverty among the educated classes is the worst\nmoral disease from which our civilization suffers.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI have now said all that I can usefully say about the several fruits of\nreligion as they are manifested in saintly lives, so I will make a brief\nreview and pass to my more general conclusions.\nOur question, you will remember, is as to whether religion stands approved\nby its fruits, as these are exhibited in the saintly type of character.\nSingle attributes of saintliness may, it is true, be temperamental\nendowments, found in non\u2010religious individuals. But the whole group of\nthem forms a combination which, as such, is religious, for it seems to\nflow from the sense of the divine as from its psychological centre.\nWhoever possesses strongly this sense comes naturally to think that the\nsmallest details of this world derive infinite significance from their\nrelation to an unseen divine order. The thought of this order yields him a\nsuperior denomination of happiness, and a steadfastness of soul with which\nno other can compare. In social relations his serviceability is exemplary;\nhe abounds in impulses to help. His help is inward as well as outward, for\nhis sympathy reaches souls as well as bodies, and kindles unsuspected\nfaculties therein. Instead of placing happiness where common men place it,\nin comfort, he places it in a higher kind of inner excitement, which\nconverts discomforts into sources of cheer and annuls unhappiness. So he\nturns his back upon no duty, however thankless; and when we are in need of\nassistance, we can count upon the saint lending his hand with more\ncertainty than we can count upon any other person. Finally, his humble\u2010\nmindedness and his ascetic tendencies save him from the petty personal\npretensions which so obstruct our ordinary social intercourse, and his\npurity gives us in him a clean man for a companion. Felicity, purity,\ncharity, patience, self\u2010severity,\u2014these are splendid excellencies, and the\nsaint of all men shows them in the completest possible measure.\nBut, as we saw, all these things together do not make saints infallible.\nWhen their intellectual outlook is narrow, they fall into all sorts of\nholy excesses, fanaticism or theopathic absorption, self\u2010torment, prudery,\nscrupulosity, gullibility, and morbid inability to meet the world. By the\nvery intensity of his fidelity to the paltry ideals with which an inferior\nintellect may inspire him, a saint can be even more objectionable and\ndamnable than a superficial carnal man would be in the same situation. We\nmust judge him not sentimentally only, and not in isolation, but using our\nown intellectual standards, placing him in his environment, and estimating\nhis total function.\nNow in the matter of intellectual standards, we must bear in mind that it\nis unfair, where we find narrowness of mind, always to impute it as a vice\nto the individual, for in religious and theological matters he probably\nabsorbs his narrowness from his generation. Moreover, we must not confound\nthe essentials of saintliness, which are those general passions of which I\nhave spoken, with its accidents, which are the special determinations of\nthese passions at any historical moment. In these determinations the\nsaints will usually be loyal to the temporary idols of their tribe. Taking\nrefuge in monasteries was as much an idol of the tribe in the middle ages,\nas bearing a hand in the world\u2019s work is to\u2010day. Saint Francis or Saint\nBernard, were they living to\u2010day, would undoubtedly be leading consecrated\nlives of some sort, but quite as undoubtedly they would not lead them in\nretirement. Our animosity to special historic manifestations must not lead\nus to give away the saintly impulses in their essential nature to the\ntender mercies of inimical critics.\nThe most inimical critic of the saintly impulses whom I know is Nietzsche.\nHe contrasts them with the worldly passions as we find these embodied in\nthe predaceous military character, altogether to the advantage of the\nlatter. Your born saint, it must be confessed, has something about him\nwhich often makes the gorge of a carnal man rise, so it will be worth\nwhile to consider the contrast in question more fully.\nDislike of the saintly nature seems to be a negative result of the\nbiologically useful instinct of welcoming leadership, and glorifying the\nchief of the tribe. The chief is the potential, if not the actual tyrant,\nthe masterful, overpowering man of prey. We confess our inferiority and\ngrovel before him. We quail under his glance, and are at the same time\nproud of owning so dangerous a lord. Such instinctive and submissive hero\u2010\nworship must have been indispensable in primeval tribal life. In the\nendless wars of those times, leaders were absolutely needed for the\ntribe\u2019s survival. If there were any tribes who owned no leaders, they can\nhave left no issue to narrate their doom. The leaders always had good\nconsciences, for conscience in them coalesced with will, and those who\nlooked on their face were as much smitten with wonder at their freedom\nfrom inner restraint as with awe at the energy of their outward\nperformances.\nCompared with these beaked and taloned graspers of the world, saints are\nherbivorous animals, tame and harmless barn\u2010yard poultry. There are saints\nwhose beard you may, if you ever care to, pull with impunity. Such a man\nexcites no thrills of wonder veiled in terror; his conscience is full of\nscruples and returns; he stuns us neither by his inward freedom nor his\noutward power; and unless he found within us an altogether different\nfaculty of admiration to appeal to, we should pass him by with contempt.\nIn point of fact, he does appeal to a different faculty. Re\u00ebnacted in\nhuman nature is the fable of the wind, the sun, and the traveler. The\nsexes embody the discrepancy. The woman loves the man the more admiringly\nthe stormier he shows himself, and the world deifies its rulers the more\nfor being willful and unaccountable. But the woman in turn subjugates the\nman by the mystery of gentleness in beauty, and the saint has always\ncharmed the world by something similar. Mankind is susceptible and\nsuggestible in opposite directions, and the rivalry of influences is\nunsleeping. The saintly and the worldly ideal pursue their feud in\nliterature as much as in real life.\nFor Nietzsche the saint represents little but sneakingness and\nslavishness. He is the sophisticated invalid, the degenerate _par\nexcellence_, the man of insufficient vitality. His prevalence would put\nthe human type in danger.\n\u201cThe sick are the greatest danger for the well. The weaker, not\nthe stronger, are the strong\u2019s undoing. It is not _fear_ of our\nfellow\u2010man, which we should wish to see diminished; for fear\nrouses those who are strong to become terrible in turn themselves,\nand preserves the hard\u2010earned and successful type of humanity.\nWhat is to be dreaded by us more than any other doom is not fear,\nbut rather the great disgust, not fear, but rather the great\npity\u2014disgust and pity for our human fellows.... The _morbid_ are\nour greatest peril\u2014not the \u2018bad\u2019 men, not the predatory beings.\nThose born wrong, the miscarried, the broken\u2014they it is, the\n_weakest_, who are undermining the vitality of the race, poisoning\nour trust in life, and putting humanity in question. Every look of\nthem is a sigh,\u2014\u2018Would I were something other! I am sick and tired\nof what I am.\u2019 In this swamp\u2010soil of self\u2010contempt, every\npoisonous weed flourishes, and all so small, so secret, so\ndishonest, and so sweetly rotten. Here swarm the worms of\nsensitiveness and resentment; here the air smells odious with\nsecrecy, with what is not to be acknowledged; here is woven\nendlessly the net of the meanest of conspiracies, the conspiracy\nof those who suffer against those who succeed and are victorious;\nhere the very aspect of the victorious is hated\u2014as if health,\nsuccess, strength, pride, and the sense of power were in\nthemselves things vicious, for which one ought eventually to make\nbitter expiation. Oh, how these people would themselves like to\ninflict the expiation, how they thirst to be the hangmen! And all\nthe while their duplicity never confesses their hatred to be\nhatred.\u201d(220)\nPoor Nietzsche\u2019s antipathy is itself sickly enough, but we all know what\nhe means, and he expresses well the clash between the two ideals. The\ncarnivorous\u2010minded \u201cstrong man,\u201d the adult male and cannibal, can see\nnothing but mouldiness and morbidness in the saint\u2019s gentleness and self\u2010\nseverity, and regards him with pure loathing. The whole feud revolves\nessentially upon two pivots: Shall the seen world or the unseen world be\nour chief sphere of adaptation? and must our means of adaptation in this\nseen world be aggressiveness or non\u2010resistance?\nThe debate is serious. In some sense and to some degree both worlds must\nbe acknowledged and taken account of; and in the seen world both\naggressiveness and non\u2010resistance are needful. It is a question of\nemphasis, of more or less. Is the saint\u2019s type or the strong\u2010man\u2019s type\nthe more ideal?\nIt has often been supposed, and even now, I think, it is supposed by most\npersons, that there can be one intrinsically ideal type of human\ncharacter. A certain kind of man, it is imagined, must be the best man\nabsolutely and apart from the utility of his function, apart from\neconomical considerations. The saint\u2019s type, and the knight\u2019s or\ngentleman\u2019s type, have always been rival claimants of this absolute\nideality; and in the ideal of military religious orders both types were in\na manner blended. According to the empirical philosophy, however, all\nideals are matters of relation. It would be absurd, for example, to ask\nfor a definition of \u201cthe ideal horse,\u201d so long as dragging drays and\nrunning races, bearing children, and jogging about with tradesmen\u2019s\npackages all remain as indispensable differentiations of equine function.\nYou may take what you call a general all\u2010round animal as a compromise, but\nhe will be inferior to any horse of a more specialized type, in some one\nparticular direction. We must not forget this now when, in discussing\nsaintliness, we ask if it be an ideal type of manhood. We must test it by\nits economical relations.\nI think that the method which Mr. Spencer uses in his Data of Ethics will\nhelp to fix our opinion. Ideality in conduct is altogether a matter of\nadaptation. A society where all were invariably aggressive would destroy\nitself by inner friction, and in a society where some are aggressive,\nothers must be non\u2010resistant, if there is to be any kind of order. This is\nthe present constitution of society, and to the mixture we owe many of our\nblessings. But the aggressive members of society are always tending to\nbecome bullies, robbers, and swindlers; and no one believes that such a\nstate of things as we now live in is the millennium. It is meanwhile quite\npossible to conceive an imaginary society in which there should be no\naggressiveness, but only sympathy and fairness,\u2014any small community of\ntrue friends now realizes such a society. Abstractly considered, such a\nsociety on a large scale would be the millennium, for every good thing\nmight be realized there with no expense of friction. To such a millennial\nsociety the saint would be entirely adapted. His peaceful modes of appeal\nwould be efficacious over his companions, and there would be no one extant\nto take advantage of his non\u2010resistance. The saint is therefore abstractly\na higher type of man than the \u201cstrong man,\u201d because he is adapted to the\nhighest society conceivable, whether that society ever be concretely\npossible or not. The strong man would immediately tend by his presence to\nmake that society deteriorate. It would become inferior in everything save\nin a certain kind of bellicose excitement, dear to men as they now are.\nBut if we turn from the abstract question to the actual situation, we find\nthat the individual saint may be well or ill adapted, according to\nparticular circumstances. There is, in short, no absoluteness in the\nexcellence of sainthood. It must be confessed that as far as this world\ngoes, any one who makes an out\u2010and\u2010out saint of himself does so at his\nperil. If he is not a large enough man, he may appear more insignificant\nand contemptible, for all his saintship, than if he had remained a\nworldling.(221) Accordingly religion has seldom been so radically taken in\nour Western world that the devotee could not mix it with some worldly\ntemper. It has always found good men who could follow most of its\nimpulses, but who stopped short when it came to non\u2010resistance. Christ\nhimself was fierce upon occasion. Cromwells, Stonewall Jacksons, Gordons,\nshow that Christians can be strong men also.\nHow is success to be absolutely measured when there are so many\nenvironments and so many ways of looking at the adaptation? It cannot be\nmeasured absolutely; the verdict will vary according to the point of view\nadopted. From the biological point of view Saint Paul was a failure,\nbecause he was beheaded. Yet he was magnificently adapted to the larger\nenvironment of history; and so far as any saint\u2019s example is a leaven of\nrighteousness in the world, and draws it in the direction of more\nprevalent habits of saintliness, he is a success, no matter what his\nimmediate bad fortune may be. The greatest saints, the spiritual heroes\nwhom every one acknowledges, the Francises, Bernards, Luthers, Loyolas,\nWesleys, Channings, Moodys, Gratrys, the Phillips Brookses, the Agnes\nJoneses, Margaret Hallahans, and Dora Pattisons, are successes from the\noutset. They show themselves, and there is no question; every one\nperceives their strength and stature. Their sense of mystery in things,\ntheir passion, their goodness, irradiate about them and enlarge their\noutlines while they soften them. They are like pictures with an atmosphere\nand background; and, placed alongside of them, the strong men of this\nworld and no other seem as dry as sticks, as hard and crude as blocks of\nstone or brickbats.\nIn a general way, then, and \u201con the whole,\u201d(222) our abandonment of\ntheological criteria, and our testing of religion by practical common\nsense and the empirical method, leave it in possession of its towering\nplace in history. Economically, the saintly group of qualities is\nindispensable to the world\u2019s welfare. The great saints are immediate\nsuccesses; the smaller ones are at least heralds and harbingers, and they\nmay be leavens also, of a better mundane order. Let us be saints, then, if\nwe can, whether or not we succeed visibly and temporally. But in our\nFather\u2019s house are many mansions, and each of us must discover for himself\nthe kind of religion and the amount of saintship which best comports with\nwhat he believes to be his powers and feels to be his truest mission and\nvocation. There are no successes to be guaranteed and no set orders to be\ngiven to individuals, so long as we follow the methods of empirical\nphilosophy.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThis is my conclusion so far. I know that on some of your minds it leaves\na feeling of wonder that such a method should have been applied to such a\nsubject, and this in spite of all those remarks about empiricism which I\nmade at the beginning of Lecture XIII.(223) How, you say, can religion,\nwhich believes in two worlds and an invisible order, be estimated by the\nadaptation of its fruits to this world\u2019s order alone? It is its _truth_,\nnot its utility, you insist, upon which our verdict ought to depend. If\nreligion is true, its fruits are good fruits, even though in this world\nthey should prove uniformly ill adapted and full of naught but pathos. It\ngoes back, then, after all, to the question of the truth of theology. The\nplot inevitably thickens upon us; we cannot escape theoretical\nconsiderations. I propose, then, that to some degree we face the\nresponsibility. Religious persons have often, though not uniformly,\nprofessed to see truth in a special manner. That manner is known as\nmysticism. I will consequently now proceed to treat at some length of\nmystical phenomena, and after that, though more briefly, I will consider\nreligious philosophy.\nLECTURES XVI AND XVII. MYSTICISM.\nOver and over again in these lectures I have raised points and left them\nopen and unfinished until we should have come to the subject of Mysticism.\nSome of you, I fear, may have smiled as you noted my reiterated\npostponements. But now the hour has come when mysticism must be faced in\ngood earnest, and those broken threads wound up together. One may say\ntruly, I think, that personal religious experience has its root and centre\nin mystical states of consciousness; so for us, who in these lectures are\ntreating personal experience as the exclusive subject of our study, such\nstates of consciousness ought to form the vital chapter from which the\nother chapters get their light. Whether my treatment of mystical states\nwill shed more light or darkness, I do not know, for my own constitution\nshuts me out from their enjoyment almost entirely, and I can speak of them\nonly at second hand. But though forced to look upon the subject so\nexternally, I will be as objective and receptive as I can; and I think I\nshall at least succeed in convincing you of the reality of the states in\nquestion, and of the paramount importance of their function.\nFirst of all, then, I ask, What does the expression \u201cmystical states of\nconsciousness\u201d mean? How do we part off mystical states from other states?\nThe words \u201cmysticism\u201d and \u201cmystical\u201d are often used as terms of mere\nreproach, to throw at any opinion which we regard as vague and vast and\nsentimental, and without a base in either facts or logic. For some writers\na \u201cmystic\u201d is any person who believes in thought\u2010transference, or spirit\u2010\nreturn. Employed in this way the word has little value: there are too many\nless ambiguous synonyms. So, to keep it useful by restricting it, I will\ndo what I did in the case of the word \u201creligion,\u201d and simply propose to\nyou four marks which, when an experience has them, may justify us in\ncalling it mystical for the purpose of the present lectures. In this way\nwe shall save verbal disputation, and the recriminations that generally go\ntherewith.\n1. _Ineffability._\u2014The handiest of the marks by which I classify a state\nof mind as mystical is negative. The subject of it immediately says that\nit defies expression, that no adequate report of its contents can be given\nin words. It follows from this that its quality must be directly\nexperienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to others. In this\npeculiarity mystical states are more like states of feeling than like\nstates of intellect. No one can make clear to another who has never had a\ncertain feeling, in what the quality or worth of it consists. One must\nhave musical ears to know the value of a symphony; one must have been in\nlove one\u2019s self to understand a lover\u2019s state of mind. Lacking the heart\nor ear, we cannot interpret the musician or the lover justly, and are even\nlikely to consider him weak\u2010minded or absurd. The mystic finds that most\nof us accord to his experiences an equally incompetent treatment.\n2. _Noetic quality._\u2014Although so similar to states of feeling, mystical\nstates seem to those who experience them to be also states of knowledge.\nThey are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the\ndiscursive intellect. They are illuminations, revelations, full of\nsignificance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain; and as a\nrule they carry with them a curious sense of authority for after\u2010time.\nThese two characters will entitle any state to be called mystical, in the\nsense in which I use the word. Two other qualities are less sharply\nmarked, but are usually found. These are:\u2014\n3. _Transiency._\u2014Mystical states cannot be sustained for long. Except in\nrare instances, half an hour, or at most an hour or two, seems to be the\nlimit beyond which they fade into the light of common day. Often, when\nfaded, their quality can but imperfectly be reproduced in memory; but when\nthey recur it is recognized; and from one recurrence to another it is\nsusceptible of continuous development in what is felt as inner richness\nand importance.\n4. _Passivity._\u2014Although the oncoming of mystical states may be\nfacilitated by preliminary voluntary operations, as by fixing the\nattention, or going through certain bodily performances, or in other ways\nwhich manuals of mysticism prescribe; yet when the characteristic sort of\nconsciousness once has set in, the mystic feels as if his own will were in\nabeyance, and indeed sometimes as if he were grasped and held by a\nsuperior power. This latter peculiarity connects mystical states with\ncertain definite phenomena of secondary or alternative personality, such\nas prophetic speech, automatic writing, or the mediumistic trance. When\nthese latter conditions are well pronounced, however, there may be no\nrecollection whatever of the phenomenon, and it may have no significance\nfor the subject\u2019s usual inner life, to which, as it were, it makes a mere\ninterruption. Mystical states, strictly so called, are never merely\ninterruptive. Some memory of their content always remains, and a profound\nsense of their importance. They modify the inner life of the subject\nbetween the times of their recurrence. Sharp divisions in this region are,\nhowever, difficult to make, and we find all sorts of gradations and\nmixtures.\nThese four characteristics are sufficient to mark out a group of states of\nconsciousness peculiar enough to deserve a special name and to call for\ncareful study. Let it then be called the mystical group.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOur next step should be to gain acquaintance with some typical examples.\nProfessional mystics at the height of their development have often\nelaborately organized experiences and a philosophy based thereupon. But\nyou remember what I said in my first lecture: phenomena are best\nunderstood when placed within their series, studied in their germ and in\ntheir over\u2010ripe decay, and compared with their exaggerated and degenerated\nkindred. The range of mystical experience is very wide, much too wide for\nus to cover in the time at our disposal. Yet the method of serial study is\nso essential for interpretation that if we really wish to reach\nconclusions we must use it. I will begin, therefore, with phenomena which\nclaim no special religious significance, and end with those of which the\nreligious pretensions are extreme.\nThe simplest rudiment of mystical experience would seem to be that\ndeepened sense of the significance of a maxim or formula which\noccasionally sweeps over one. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that said all my life,\u201d we\nexclaim, \u201cbut I never realized its full meaning until now.\u201d \u201cWhen a\nfellow\u2010monk,\u201d said Luther, \u201cone day repeated the words of the Creed: \u2018I\nbelieve in the forgiveness of sins,\u2019 I saw the Scripture in an entirely\nnew light; and straightway I felt as if I were born anew. It was as if I\nhad found the door of paradise thrown wide open.\u201d(224) This sense of\ndeeper significance is not confined to rational propositions. Single\nwords,(225) and conjunctions of words, effects of light on land and sea,\nodors and musical sounds, all bring it when the mind is tuned aright. Most\nof us can remember the strangely moving power of passages in certain poems\nread when we were young, irrational doorways as they were through which\nthe mystery of fact, the wildness and the pang of life, stole into our\nhearts and thrilled them. The words have now perhaps become mere polished\nsurfaces for us; but lyric poetry and music are alive and significant only\nin proportion as they fetch these vague vistas of a life continuous with\nour own, beckoning and inviting, yet ever eluding our pursuit. We are\nalive or dead to the eternal inner message of the arts according as we\nhave kept or lost this mystical susceptibility.\nA more pronounced step forward on the mystical ladder is found in an\nextremely frequent phenomenon, that sudden feeling, namely, which\nsometimes sweeps over us, of having \u201cbeen here before,\u201d as if at some\nindefinite past time, in just this place, with just these people, we were\nalready saying just these things. As Tennyson writes:\n\u201cMoreover, something is or seems,\nThat touches me with mystic gleams,\nLike glimpses of forgotten dreams\u2014\n\u201cOf something felt, like something here;\nOf something done, I know not where;\nSuch as no language may declare.\u201d(226)\nSir James Crichton\u2010Browne has given the technical name of \u201cdreamy states\u201d\nto these sudden invasions of vaguely reminiscent consciousness.(227) They\nbring a sense of mystery and of the metaphysical duality of things, and\nthe feeling of an enlargement of perception which seems imminent but which\nnever completes itself. In Dr. Crichton\u2010Browne\u2019s opinion they connect\nthemselves with the perplexed and scared disturbances of self\u2010\nconsciousness which occasionally precede epileptic attacks. I think that\nthis learned alienist takes a rather absurdly alarmist view of an\nintrinsically insignificant phenomenon. He follows it along the downward\nladder, to insanity; our path pursues the upward ladder chiefly. The\ndivergence shows how important it is to neglect no part of a phenomenon\u2019s\nconnections, for we make it appear admirable or dreadful according to the\ncontext by which we set it off.\nSomewhat deeper plunges into mystical consciousness are met with in yet\nother dreamy states. Such feelings as these which Charles Kingsley\ndescribes are surely far from being uncommon, especially in youth:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I walk the fields, I am oppressed now and then with an\ninnate feeling that everything I see has a meaning, if I could but\nunderstand it. And this feeling of being surrounded with truths\nwhich I cannot grasp amounts to indescribable awe sometimes....\nHave you not felt that your real soul was imperceptible to your\nmental vision, except in a few hallowed moments?\u201d(228)\nA much more extreme state of mystical consciousness is described by J. A.\nSymonds; and probably more persons than we suspect could give parallels to\nit from their own experience.\n\u201cSuddenly,\u201d writes Symonds, \u201cat church, or in company, or when I\nwas reading, and always, I think, when my muscles were at rest, I\nfelt the approach of the mood. Irresistibly it took possession of\nmy mind and will, lasted what seemed an eternity, and disappeared\nin a series of rapid sensations which resembled the awakening from\nan\u00e6sthetic influence. One reason why I disliked this kind of\ntrance was that I could not describe it to myself. I cannot even\nnow find words to render it intelligible. It consisted in a\ngradual but swiftly progressive obliteration of space, time,\nsensation, and the multitudinous factors of experience which seem\nto qualify what we are pleased to call our Self. In proportion as\nthese conditions of ordinary consciousness were subtracted, the\nsense of an underlying or essential consciousness acquired\nintensity. At last nothing remained but a pure, absolute, abstract\nSelf. The universe became without form and void of content. But\nSelf persisted, formidable in its vivid keenness, feeling the most\npoignant doubt about reality, ready, as it seemed, to find\nexistence break as breaks a bubble round about it. And what then?\nThe apprehension of a coming dissolution, the grim conviction that\nthis state was the last state of the conscious Self, the sense\nthat I had followed the last thread of being to the verge of the\nabyss, and had arrived at demonstration of eternal Maya or\nillusion, stirred or seemed to stir me up again. The return to\nordinary conditions of sentient existence began by my first\nrecovering the power of touch, and then by the gradual though\nrapid influx of familiar impressions and diurnal interests. At\nlast I felt myself once more a human being; and though the riddle\nof what is meant by life remained unsolved, I was thankful for\nthis return from the abyss\u2014this deliverance from so awful an\ninitiation into the mysteries of skepticism.\n\u201cThis trance recurred with diminishing frequency until I reached\nthe age of twenty\u2010eight. It served to impress upon my growing\nnature the phantasmal unreality of all the circumstances which\ncontribute to a merely phenomenal consciousness. Often have I\nasked myself with anguish, on waking from that formless state of\ndenuded, keenly sentient being, Which is the unreality?\u2014the trance\nof fiery, vacant, apprehensive, skeptical Self from which I issue,\nor these surrounding phenomena and habits which veil that inner\nSelf and build a self of flesh\u2010and\u2010blood conventionality? Again,\nare men the factors of some dream, the dream\u2010like unsubstantiality\nof which they comprehend at such eventful moments? What would\nhappen if the final stage of the trance were reached?\u201d(229)\nIn a recital like this there is certainly something suggestive of\npathology.(230) The next step into mystical states carries us into a realm\nthat public opinion and ethical philosophy have long since branded as\npathological, though private practice and certain lyric strains of poetry\nseem still to bear witness to its ideality. I refer to the consciousness\nproduced by intoxicants and an\u00e6sthetics, especially by alcohol. The sway\nof alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulate\nthe mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the\ncold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour. Sobriety diminishes,\ndiscriminates, and says no; drunkenness expands, unites, and says yes. It\nis in fact the great exciter of the _Yes_ function in man. It brings its\nvotary from the chill periphery of things to the radiant core. It makes\nhim for the moment one with truth. Not through mere perversity do men run\nafter it. To the poor and the unlettered it stands in the place of\nsymphony concerts and of literature; and it is part of the deeper mystery\nand tragedy of life that whiffs and gleams of something that we\nimmediately recognize as excellent should be vouchsafed to so many of us\nonly in the fleeting earlier phases of what in its totality is so\ndegrading a poisoning. The drunken consciousness is one bit of the mystic\nconsciousness, and our total opinion of it must find its place in our\nopinion of that larger whole.\nNitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide, when sufficiently\ndiluted with air, stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary\ndegree. Depth beyond depth of truth seems revealed to the inhaler. This\ntruth fades out, however, or escapes, at the moment of coming to; and if\nany words remain over in which it seemed to clothe itself, they prove to\nbe the veriest nonsense. Nevertheless, the sense of a profound meaning\nhaving been there persists; and I know more than one person who is\npersuaded that in the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysical\nrevelation.\nSome years ago I myself made some observations on this aspect of nitrous\noxide intoxication, and reported them in print. One conclusion was forced\nupon my mind at that time, and my impression of its truth has ever since\nremained unshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational\nconsciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness,\nwhilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie\npotential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through\nlife without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus,\nand at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of\nmentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and\nadaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which\nleaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard\nthem is the question,\u2014for they are so discontinuous with ordinary\nconsciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish\nformulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate,\nthey forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality. Looking back\non my own experiences, they all converge towards a kind of insight to\nwhich I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. The keynote\nof it is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the\nworld, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our difficulties and\ntroubles, were melted into unity. Not only do they, as contrasted species,\nbelong to one and the same genus, but _one of the species_, the nobler and\nbetter one, _is itself the genus, and so soaks up and absorbs its opposite\ninto itself_. This is a dark saying, I know, when thus expressed in terms\nof common logic, but I cannot wholly escape from its authority. I feel as\nif it must mean something, something like what the Hegelian philosophy\nmeans, if one could only lay hold of it more clearly. Those who have ears\nto hear, let them hear; to me the living sense of its reality only comes\nin the artificial mystic state of mind.(231)\nI just now spoke of friends who believe in the an\u00e6sthetic revelation. For\nthem too it is a monistic insight, in which the _other_ in its various\nforms appears absorbed into the One.\n\u201cInto this pervading genius,\u201d writes one of them, \u201cwe pass,\nforgetting and forgotten, and thenceforth each is all, in God.\nThere is no higher, no deeper, no other, than the life in which we\nare founded. \u2018The One remains, the many change and pass;\u2019 and each\nand every one of us _is_ the One that remains.... This is the\nultimatum.... As sure as being\u2014whence is all our care\u2014so sure is\ncontent, beyond duplexity, antithesis, or trouble, where I have\ntriumphed in a solitude that God is not above.\u201d(232)\nThis has the genuine religious mystic ring! I just now quoted J. A.\nSymonds. He also records a mystical experience with chloroform, as\nfollows:\u2014\n\u201cAfter the choking and stifling had passed away, I seemed at first\nin a state of utter blankness; then came flashes of intense light,\nalternating with blackness, and with a keen vision of what was\ngoing on in the room around me, but no sensation of touch. I\nthought that I was near death; when, suddenly, my soul became\naware of God, who was manifestly dealing with me, handling me, so\nto speak, in an intense personal present reality. I felt him\nstreaming in like light upon me.... I cannot describe the ecstasy\nI felt. Then, as I gradually awoke from the influence of the\nan\u00e6sthetics, the old sense of my relation to the world began to\nreturn, the new sense of my relation to God began to fade. I\nsuddenly leapt to my feet on the chair where I was sitting, and\nshrieked out, \u2018It is too horrible, it is too horrible, it is too\nhorrible,\u2019 meaning that I could not bear this disillusionment.\nThen I flung myself on the ground, and at last awoke covered with\nblood, calling to the two surgeons (who were frightened), \u2018Why did\nyou not kill me? Why would you not let me die?\u2019 Only think of it.\nTo have felt for that long dateless ecstasy of vision the very\nGod, in all purity and tenderness and truth and absolute love, and\nthen to find that I had after all had no revelation, but that I\nhad been tricked by the abnormal excitement of my brain.\n\u201cYet, this question remains, Is it possible that the inner sense\nof reality which succeeded, when my flesh was dead to impressions\nfrom without, to the ordinary sense of physical relations, was not\na delusion but an actual experience? Is it possible that I, in\nthat moment, felt what some of the saints have said they always\nfelt, the undemonstrable but irrefragable certainty of God?\u201d(233)\nWith this we make connection with religious mysticism pure and simple.\nSymonds\u2019s question takes us back to those examples which you will remember\nmy quoting in the lecture on the Reality of the Unseen, of sudden\nrealization of the immediate presence of God. The phenomenon in one shape\nor another is not uncommon.\n\u201cI know,\u201d writes Mr. Trine, \u201can officer on our police force who\nhas told me that many times when off duty, and on his way home in\nthe evening, there comes to him such a vivid and vital realization\nof his oneness with this Infinite Power, and this Spirit of\nInfinite Peace so takes hold of and so fills him, that it seems as\nif his feet could hardly keep to the pavement, so buoyant and so\nexhilarated does he become by reason of this inflowing tide.\u201d(234)\nCertain aspects of nature seem to have a peculiar power of awakening such\nmystical moods.(235) Most of the striking cases which I have collected\nhave occurred out of doors. Literature has commemorated this fact in many\npassages of great beauty\u2014this extract, for example, from Amiel\u2019s Journal\nIntime:\u2014\n\u201cShall I ever again have any of those prodigious reveries which\nsometimes came to me in former days? One day, in youth, at\nsunrise, sitting in the ruins of the castle of Faucigny; and again\nin the mountains, under the noonday sun, above Lavey, lying at the\nfoot of a tree and visited by three butterflies; once more at\nnight upon the shingly shore of the Northern Ocean, my back upon\nthe sand and my vision ranging through the milky way;\u2014such grand\nand spacious, immortal, cosmogonic reveries, when one reaches to\nthe stars, when one owns the infinite! Moments divine, ecstatic\nhours; in which our thought flies from world to world, pierces the\ngreat enigma, breathes with a respiration broad, tranquil, and\ndeep as the respiration of the ocean, serene and limitless as the\nblue firmament; ... instants of irresistible intuition in which\none feels one\u2019s self great as the universe, and calm as a god....\nWhat hours, what memories! The vestiges they leave behind are\nenough to fill us with belief and enthusiasm, as if they were\nvisits of the Holy Ghost.\u201d(236)\nHere is a similar record from the memoirs of that interesting German\nidealist, Malwida von Meysenbug:\u2014\n\u201cI was alone upon the seashore as all these thoughts flowed over\nme, liberating and reconciling; and now again, as once before in\ndistant days in the Alps of Dauphin\u00e9, I was impelled to kneel\ndown, this time before the illimitable ocean, symbol of the\nInfinite. I felt that I prayed as I had never prayed before, and\nknew now what prayer really is: to return from the solitude of\nindividuation into the consciousness of unity with all that is, to\nkneel down as one that passes away, and to rise up as one\nimperishable. Earth, heaven, and sea resounded as in one vast\nworld\u2010encircling harmony. It was as if the chorus of all the great\nwho had ever lived were about me. I felt myself one with them, and\nit appeared as if I heard their greeting: \u2018Thou too belongest to\nthe company of those who overcome.\u2019 \u201d(237)\nThe well\u2010known passage from Walt Whitman is a classical expression of this\nsporadic type of mystical experience.\n\u201cI believe in you, my Soul ...\nLoaf with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat;...\nOnly the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\nI mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning.\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that\npass all the argument of the earth,\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers and the women\nmy sisters and lovers,\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love.\u201d(238)\nI could easily give more instances, but one will suffice. I take it from\nthe Autobiography of J. Trevor.(239)\n\u201cOne brilliant Sunday morning, my wife and boys went to the\nUnitarian Chapel in Macclesfield. I felt it impossible to\naccompany them\u2014as though to leave the sunshine on the hills, and\ngo down there to the chapel, would be for the time an act of\nspiritual suicide. And I felt such need for new inspiration and\nexpansion in my life. So, very reluctantly and sadly, I left my\nwife and boys to go down into the town, while I went further up\ninto the hills with my stick and my dog. In the loveliness of the\nmorning, and the beauty of the hills and valleys, I soon lost my\nsense of sadness and regret. For nearly an hour I walked along the\nroad to the \u2018Cat and Fiddle,\u2019 and then returned. On the way back,\nsuddenly, without warning, I felt that I was in Heaven\u2014an inward\nstate of peace and joy and assurance indescribably intense,\naccompanied with a sense of being bathed in a warm glow of light,\nas though the external condition had brought about the internal\neffect\u2014a feeling of having passed beyond the body, though the\nscene around me stood out more clearly and as if nearer to me than\nbefore, by reason of the illumination in the midst of which I\nseemed to be placed. This deep emotion lasted, though with\ndecreasing strength, until I reached home, and for some time\nafter, only gradually passing away.\u201d\nThe writer adds that having had further experiences of a similar sort, he\nnow knows them well.\n\u201cThe spiritual life,\u201d he writes, \u201cjustifies itself to those who\nlive it; but what can we say to those who do not understand? This,\nat least, we can say, that it is a life whose experiences are\nproved real to their possessor, because they remain with him when\nbrought closest into contact with the objective realities of life.\nDreams cannot stand this test. We wake from them to find that they\nare but dreams. Wanderings of an overwrought brain do not stand\nthis test. These highest experiences that I have had of God\u2019s\npresence have been rare and brief\u2014flashes of consciousness which\nhave compelled me to exclaim with surprise\u2014God is _here_!\u2014or\nconditions of exaltation and insight, less intense, and only\ngradually passing away. I have severely questioned the worth of\nthese moments. To no soul have I named them, lest I should be\nbuilding my life and work on mere phantasies of the brain. But I\nfind that, after every questioning and test, they stand out to\u2010day\nas the most real experiences of my life, and experiences which\nhave explained and justified and unified all past experiences and\nall past growth. Indeed, their reality and their far\u2010reaching\nsignificance are ever becoming more clear and evident. When they\ncame, I was living the fullest, strongest, sanest, deepest life. I\nwas not seeking them. What I was seeking, with resolute\ndetermination, was to live more intensely my own life, as against\nwhat I knew would be the adverse judgment of the world. It was in\nthe most real seasons that the Real Presence came, and I was aware\nthat I was immersed in the infinite ocean of God.\u201d(240)\nEven the least mystical of you must by this time be convinced of the\nexistence of mystical moments as states of consciousness of an entirely\nspecific quality, and of the deep impression which they make on those who\nhave them. A Canadian psychiatrist, Dr. R. M. Bucke, gives to the more\ndistinctly characterized of these phenomena the name of cosmic\nconsciousness. \u201cCosmic consciousness in its more striking instances is\nnot,\u201d Dr. Bucke says, \u201csimply an expansion or extension of the self\u2010\nconscious mind with which we are all familiar, but the superaddition of a\nfunction as distinct from any possessed by the average man as\n_self_\u2010consciousness is distinct from any function possessed by one of the\nhigher animals.\u201d\n\u201cThe prime characteristic of cosmic consciousness is a\nconsciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the life and order of the\nuniverse. Along with the consciousness of the cosmos there occurs\nan intellectual enlightenment which alone would place the\nindividual on a new plane of existence\u2014would make him almost a\nmember of a new species. To this is added a state of moral\nexaltation, an indescribable feeling of elevation, elation, and\njoyousness, and a quickening of the moral sense, which is fully as\nstriking, and more important than is the enhanced intellectual\npower. With these come what may be called a sense of immortality,\na consciousness of eternal life, not a conviction that he shall\nhave this, but the consciousness that he has it already.\u201d(241)\nIt was Dr. Bucke\u2019s own experience of a typical onset of cosmic\nconsciousness in his own person which led him to investigate it in others.\nHe has printed his conclusions in a highly interesting volume, from which\nI take the following account of what occurred to him:\u2014\n\u201cI had spent the evening in a great city, with two friends,\nreading and discussing poetry and philosophy. We parted at\nmidnight. I had a long drive in a hansom to my lodging. My mind,\ndeeply under the influence of the ideas, images, and emotions\ncalled up by the reading and talk, was calm and peaceful. I was in\na state of quiet, almost passive enjoyment, not actually thinking,\nbut letting ideas, images, and emotions flow of themselves, as it\nwere, through my mind. All at once, without warning of any kind, I\nfound myself wrapped in a flame\u2010colored cloud. For an instant I\nthought of fire, an immense conflagration somewhere close by in\nthat great city; the next, I knew that the fire was within myself.\nDirectly afterward there came upon me a sense of exultation, of\nimmense joyousness accompanied or immediately followed by an\nintellectual illumination impossible to describe. Among other\nthings, I did not merely come to believe, but I saw that the\nuniverse is not composed of dead matter, but is, on the contrary,\na living Presence; I became conscious in myself of eternal life.\nIt was not a conviction that I would have eternal life, but a\nconsciousness that I possessed eternal life then; I saw that all\nmen are immortal; that the cosmic order is such that without any\nperadventure all things work together for the good of each and\nall; that the foundation principle of the world, of all the\nworlds, is what we call love, and that the happiness of each and\nall is in the long run absolutely certain. The vision lasted a few\nseconds and was gone; but the memory of it and the sense of the\nreality of what it taught has remained during the quarter of a\ncentury which has since elapsed. I knew that what the vision\nshowed was true. I had attained to a point of view from which I\nsaw that it must be true. That view, that conviction, I may say\nthat consciousness, has never, even during periods of the deepest\ndepression, been lost.\u201d(242)\nWe have now seen enough of this cosmic or mystic consciousness, as it\ncomes sporadically. We must next pass to its methodical cultivation as an\nelement of the religious life. Hindus, Buddhists, Mohammedans, and\nChristians all have cultivated it methodically.\nIn India, training in mystical insight has been known from time immemorial\nunder the name of yoga. Yoga means the experimental union of the\nindividual with the divine. It is based on persevering exercise; and the\ndiet, posture, breathing, intellectual concentration, and moral discipline\nvary slightly in the different systems which teach it. The yogi, or\ndisciple, who has by these means overcome the obscurations of his lower\nnature sufficiently, enters into the condition termed _sam\u00e2dhi_, \u201cand\ncomes face to face with facts which no instinct or reason can ever know.\u201d\nHe learns\u2014\n\u201cThat the mind itself has a higher state of existence, beyond\nreason, a superconscious state, and that when the mind gets to\nthat higher state, then this knowledge beyond reasoning comes....\nAll the different steps in yoga are intended to bring us\nscientifically to the superconscious state or sam\u00e2dhi.... Just as\nunconscious work is beneath consciousness, so there is another\nwork which is above consciousness, and which, also, is not\naccompanied with the feeling of egoism.... There is no feeling of\n_I_, and yet the mind works, desireless, free from restlessness,\nobjectless, bodiless. Then the Truth shines in its full\neffulgence, and we know ourselves\u2014for Sam\u00e2dhi lies potential in us\nall\u2014for what we truly are, free, immortal, omnipotent, loosed from\nthe finite, and its contrasts of good and evil altogether, and\nidentical with the Atman or Universal Soul.\u201d(243)\nThe Vedantists say that one may stumble into superconsciousness\nsporadically, without the previous discipline, but it is then impure.\nTheir test of its purity, like our test of religion\u2019s value, is empirical:\nits fruits must be good for life. When a man comes out of Sam\u00e2dhi, they\nassure us that he remains \u201cenlightened, a sage, a prophet, a saint, his\nwhole character changed, his life changed, illumined.\u201d(244)\nThe Buddhists use the word \u201csam\u00e2dhi\u201d as well as the Hindus; but \u201cdhy\u00e2na\u201d\nis their special word for higher states of contemplation. There seem to be\nfour stages recognized in dhy\u00e2na. The first stage comes through\nconcentration of the mind upon one point. It excludes desire, but not\ndiscernment or judgment: it is still intellectual. In the second stage the\nintellectual functions drop off, and the satisfied sense of unity remains.\nIn the third stage the satisfaction departs, and indifference begins,\nalong with memory and self\u2010consciousness. In the fourth stage the\nindifference, memory, and self\u2010consciousness are perfected. [Just what\n\u201cmemory\u201d and \u201cself\u2010consciousness\u201d mean in this connection is doubtful.\nThey cannot be the faculties familiar to us in the lower life.] Higher\nstages still of contemplation are mentioned\u2014a region where there exists\nnothing, and where the meditator says: \u201cThere exists absolutely nothing,\u201d\nand stops. Then he reaches another region where he says: \u201cThere are\nneither ideas nor absence of ideas,\u201d and stops again. Then another region\nwhere, \u201chaving reached the end of both idea and perception, he stops\nfinally.\u201d This would seem to be, not yet Nirv\u00e2na, but as close an approach\nto it as this life affords.(245)\nIn the Mohammedan world the Sufi sect and various dervish bodies are the\npossessors of the mystical tradition. The Sufis have existed in Persia\nfrom the earliest times, and as their pantheism is so at variance with the\nhot and rigid monotheism of the Arab mind, it has been suggested that\nSufism must have been inoculated into Islam by Hindu influences. We\nChristians know little of Sufism, for its secrets are disclosed only to\nthose initiated. To give its existence a certain liveliness in your minds,\nI will quote a Moslem document, and pass away from the subject.\nAl\u2010Ghazzali, a Persian philosopher and theologian, who flourished in the\neleventh century, and ranks as one of the greatest doctors of the Moslem\nchurch, has left us one of the few autobiographies to be found outside of\nChristian literature. Strange that a species of book so abundant among\nourselves should be so little represented elsewhere\u2014the absence of\nstrictly personal confessions is the chief difficulty to the purely\nliterary student who would like to become acquainted with the inwardness\nof religions other than the Christian.\nM. Schm\u00f6lders has translated a part of Al\u2010Ghazzali\u2019s autobiography into\nFrench:(246)\u2014\n\u201cThe Science of the Sufis,\u201d says the Moslem author, \u201caims at\ndetaching the heart from all that is not God, and at giving to it\nfor sole occupation the meditation of the divine being. Theory\nbeing more easy for me than practice, I read [certain books] until\nI understood all that can be learned by study and hearsay. Then I\nrecognized that what pertains most exclusively to their method is\njust what no study can grasp, but only transport, ecstasy, and the\ntransformation of the soul. How great, for example, is the\ndifference between knowing the definitions of health, of satiety,\nwith their causes and conditions, and being really healthy or\nfilled. How different to know in what drunkenness consists,\u2014as\nbeing a state occasioned by a vapor that rises from the\nstomach,\u2014and _being_ drunk effectively. Without doubt, the drunken\nman knows neither the definition of drunkenness nor what makes it\ninteresting for science. Being drunk, he knows nothing; whilst the\nphysician, although not drunk, knows well in what drunkenness\nconsists, and what are its predisposing conditions. Similarly\nthere is a difference between knowing the nature of abstinence,\nand _being_ abstinent or having one\u2019s soul detached from the\nworld.\u2014Thus I had learned what words could teach of Sufism, but\nwhat was left could be learned neither by study nor through the\nears, but solely by giving one\u2019s self up to ecstasy and leading a\npious life.\n\u201cReflecting on my situation, I found myself tied down by a\nmultitude of bonds\u2014temptations on every side. Considering my\nteaching, I found it was impure before God. I saw myself\nstruggling with all my might to achieve glory and to spread my\nname. [Here follows an account of his six months\u2019 hesitation to\nbreak away from the conditions of his life at Bagdad, at the end\nof which he fell ill with a paralysis of the tongue.] Then,\nfeeling my own weakness, and having entirely given up my own will,\nI repaired to God like a man in distress who has no more\nresources. He answered, as he answers the wretch who invokes him.\nMy heart no longer felt any difficulty in renouncing glory,\nwealth, and my children. So I quitted Bagdad, and reserving from\nmy fortune only what was indispensable for my subsistence, I\ndistributed the rest. I went to Syria, where I remained about two\nyears, with no other occupation than living in retreat and\nsolitude, conquering my desires, combating my passions, training\nmyself to purify my soul, to make my character perfect, to prepare\nmy heart for meditating on God\u2014all according to the methods of the\nSufis, as I had read of them.\n\u201cThis retreat only increased my desire to live in solitude, and to\ncomplete the purification of my heart and fit it for meditation.\nBut the vicissitudes of the times, the affairs of the family, the\nneed of subsistence, changed in some respects my primitive\nresolve, and interfered with my plans for a purely solitary life.\nI had never yet found myself completely in ecstasy, save in a few\nsingle hours; nevertheless, I kept the hope of attaining this\nstate. Every time that the accidents led me astray, I sought to\nreturn; and in this situation I spent ten years. During this\nsolitary state things were revealed to me which it is impossible\neither to describe or to point out. I recognized for certain that\nthe Sufis are assuredly walking in the path of God. Both in their\nacts and in their inaction, whether internal or external, they are\nillumined by the light which proceeds from the prophetic source.\nThe first condition for a Sufi is to purge his heart entirely of\nall that is not God. The next key of the contemplative life\nconsists in the humble prayers which escape from the fervent soul,\nand in the meditations on God in which the heart is swallowed up\nentirely. But in reality this is only the beginning of the Sufi\nlife, the end of Sufism being total absorption in God. The\nintuitions and all that precede are, so to speak, only the\nthreshold for those who enter. From the beginning, revelations\ntake place in so flagrant a shape that the Sufis see before them,\nwhilst wide awake, the angels and the souls of the prophets. They\nhear their voices and obtain their favors. Then the transport\nrises from the perception of forms and figures to a degree which\nescapes all expression, and which no man may seek to give an\naccount of without his words involving sin.\n\u201cWhoever has had no experience of the transport knows of the true\nnature of prophetism nothing but the name. He may meanwhile be\nsure of its existence, both by experience and by what he hears the\nSufis say. As there are men endowed only with the sensitive\nfaculty who reject what is offered them in the way of objects of\nthe pure understanding, so there are intellectual men who reject\nand avoid the things perceived by the prophetic faculty. A blind\nman can understand nothing of colors save what he has learned by\nnarration and hearsay. Yet God has brought prophetism near to men\nin giving them all a state analogous to it in its principal\ncharacters. This state is sleep. If you were to tell a man who was\nhimself without experience of such a phenomenon that there are\npeople who at times swoon away so as to resemble dead men, and who\n[in dreams] yet perceive things that are hidden, he would deny it\n[and give his reasons]. Nevertheless, his arguments would be\nrefuted by actual experience. Wherefore, just as the understanding\nis a stage of human life in which an eye opens to discern various\nintellectual objects uncomprehended by sensation; just so in the\nprophetic the sight is illumined by a light which uncovers hidden\nthings and objects which the intellect fails to reach. The chief\nproperties of prophetism are perceptible only during the\ntransport, by those who embrace the Sufi life. The prophet is\nendowed with qualities to which you possess nothing analogous, and\nwhich consequently you cannot possibly understand. How should you\nknow their true nature, since one knows only what one can\ncomprehend? But the transport which one attains by the method of\nthe Sufis is like an immediate perception, as if one touched the\nobjects with one\u2019s hand.\u201d(247)\nThis incommunicableness of the transport is the keynote of all mysticism.\nMystical truth exists for the individual who has the transport, but for no\none else. In this, as I have said, it resembles the knowledge given to us\nin sensations more than that given by conceptual thought. Thought, with\nits remoteness and abstractness, has often enough in the history of\nphilosophy been contrasted unfavorably with sensation. It is a commonplace\nof metaphysics that God\u2019s knowledge cannot be discursive but must be\nintuitive, that is, must be constructed more after the pattern of what in\nourselves is called immediate feeling, than after that of proposition and\njudgment. But _our_ immediate feelings have no content but what the five\nsenses supply; and we have seen and shall see again that mystics may\nemphatically deny that the senses play any part in the very highest type\nof knowledge which their transports yield.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn the Christian church there have always been mystics. Although many of\nthem have been viewed with suspicion, some have gained favor in the eyes\nof the authorities. The experiences of these have been treated as\nprecedents, and a codified system of mystical theology has been based upon\nthem, in which everything legitimate finds its place.(248) The basis of\nthe system is \u201corison\u201d or meditation, the methodical elevation of the soul\ntowards God. Through the practice of orison the higher levels of mystical\nexperience may be attained. It is odd that Protestantism, especially\nevangelical Protestantism, should seemingly have abandoned everything\nmethodical in this line. Apart from what prayer may lead to, Protestant\nmystical experience appears to have been almost exclusively sporadic. It\nhas been left to our mind\u2010curers to reintroduce methodical meditation into\nour religious life.\nThe first thing to be aimed at in orison is the mind\u2019s detachment from\nouter sensations, for these interfere with its concentration upon ideal\nthings. Such manuals as Saint Ignatius\u2019s Spiritual Exercises recommend the\ndisciple to expel sensation by a graduated series of efforts to imagine\nholy scenes. The acme of this kind of discipline would be a semi\u2010\nhallucinatory mono\u2010ideism\u2014an imaginary figure of Christ, for example,\ncoming fully to occupy the mind. Sensorial images of this sort, whether\nliteral or symbolic, play an enormous part in mysticism.(249) But in\ncertain cases imagery may fall away entirely, and in the very highest\nraptures it tends to do so. The state of consciousness becomes then\ninsusceptible of any verbal description. Mystical teachers are unanimous\nas to this. Saint John of the Cross, for instance, one of the best of\nthem, thus describes the condition called the \u201cunion of love,\u201d which, he\nsays, is reached by \u201cdark contemplation.\u201d In this the Deity compenetrates\nthe soul, but in such a hidden way that the soul\u2014\n\u201cfinds no terms, no means, no comparison whereby to render the\nsublimity of the wisdom and the delicacy of the spiritual feeling\nwith which she is filled.... We receive this mystical knowledge of\nGod clothed in none of the kinds of images, in none of the\nsensible representations, which our mind makes use of in other\ncircumstances. Accordingly in this knowledge, since the senses and\nthe imagination are not employed, we get neither form nor\nimpression, nor can we give any account or furnish any likeness,\nalthough the mysterious and sweet\u2010tasting wisdom comes home so\nclearly to the inmost parts of our soul. Fancy a man seeing a\ncertain kind of thing for the first time in his life. He can\nunderstand it, use and enjoy it, but he cannot apply a name to it,\nnor communicate any idea of it, even though all the while it be a\nmere thing of sense. How much greater will be his powerlessness\nwhen it goes beyond the senses! This is the peculiarity of the\ndivine language. The more infused, intimate, spiritual, and\nsupersensible it is, the more does it exceed the senses, both\ninner and outer, and impose silence upon them.... The soul then\nfeels as if placed in a vast and profound solitude, to which no\ncreated thing has access, in an immense and boundless desert,\ndesert the more delicious the more solitary it is. There, in this\nabyss of wisdom, the soul grows by what it drinks in from the\nwell\u2010springs of the comprehension of love, ... and recognizes,\nhowever sublime and learned may be the terms we employ, how\nutterly vile, insignificant, and improper they are, when we seek\nto discourse of divine things by their means.\u201d(250)\nI cannot pretend to detail to you the sundry stages of the Christian\nmystical life.(251) Our time would not suffice, for one thing; and\nmoreover, I confess that the subdivisions and names which we find in the\nCatholic books seem to me to represent nothing objectively distinct. So\nmany men, so many minds: I imagine that these experiences can be as\ninfinitely varied as are the idiosyncrasies of individuals.\nThe cognitive aspects of them, their value in the way of revelation, is\nwhat we are directly concerned with, and it is easy to show by citation\nhow strong an impression they leave of being revelations of new depths of\ntruth. Saint Teresa is the expert of experts in describing such\nconditions, so I will turn immediately to what she says of one of the\nhighest of them, the \u201corison of union.\u201d\n\u201cIn the orison of union,\u201d says Saint Teresa, \u201cthe soul is fully\nawake as regards God, but wholly asleep as regards things of this\nworld and in respect of herself. During the short time the union\nlasts, she is as it were deprived of every feeling, and even if\nshe would, she could not think of any single thing. Thus she needs\nto employ no artifice in order to arrest the use of her\nunderstanding: it remains so stricken with inactivity that she\nneither knows what she loves, nor in what manner she loves, nor\nwhat she wills. In short, she is utterly dead to the things of the\nworld and lives solely in God.... I do not even know whether in\nthis state she has enough life left to breathe. It seems to me she\nhas not; or at least that if she does breathe, she is unaware of\nit. Her intellect would fain understand something of what is going\non within her, but it has so little force now that it can act in\nno way whatsoever. So a person who falls into a deep faint appears\nas if dead....\n\u201cThus does God, when he raises a soul to union with himself,\nsuspend the natural action of all her faculties. She neither sees,\nhears, nor understands, so long as she is united with God. But\nthis time is always short, and it seems even shorter than it is.\nGod establishes himself in the interior of this soul in such a\nway, that when she returns to herself, it is wholly impossible for\nher to doubt that she has been in God, and God in her. This truth\nremains so strongly impressed on her that, even though many years\nshould pass without the condition returning, she can neither\nforget the favor she received, nor doubt of its reality. If you,\nnevertheless, ask how it is possible that the soul can see and\nunderstand that she has been in God, since during the union she\nhas neither sight nor understanding, I reply that she does not see\nit then, but that she sees it clearly later, after she has\nreturned to herself, not by any vision, but by a certitude which\nabides with her and which God alone can give her. I knew a person\nwho was ignorant of the truth that God\u2019s mode of being in\neverything must be either by presence, by power, or by essence,\nbut who, after having received the grace of which I am speaking,\nbelieved this truth in the most unshakable manner. So much so\nthat, having consulted a half\u2010learned man who was as ignorant on\nthis point as she had been before she was enlightened, when he\nreplied that God is in us only by \u2018grace,\u2019 she disbelieved his\nreply, so sure she was of the true answer; and when she came to\nask wiser doctors, they confirmed her in her belief, which much\nconsoled her....\n\u201cBut how, you will repeat, _can_ one have such certainty in\nrespect to what one does not see? This question, I am powerless to\nanswer. These are secrets of God\u2019s omnipotence which it does not\nappertain to me to penetrate. All that I know is that I tell the\ntruth; and I shall never believe that any soul who does not\npossess this certainty has ever been really united to God.\u201d(252)\nThe kinds of truth communicable in mystical ways, whether these be\nsensible or supersensible, are various. Some of them relate to this\nworld,\u2014visions of the future, the reading of hearts, the sudden\nunderstanding of texts, the knowledge of distant events, for example; but\nthe most important revelations are theological or metaphysical.\n\u201cSaint Ignatius confessed one day to Father Laynez that a single\nhour of meditation at Manresa had taught him more truths about\nheavenly things than all the teachings of all the doctors put\ntogether could have taught him.... One day in orison, on the steps\nof the choir of the Dominican church, he saw in a distinct manner\nthe plan of divine wisdom in the creation of the world. On another\noccasion, during a procession, his spirit was ravished in God, and\nit was given him to contemplate, in a form and images fitted to\nthe weak understanding of a dweller on the earth, the deep mystery\nof the holy Trinity. This last vision flooded his heart with such\nsweetness, that the mere memory of it in after times made him shed\nabundant tears.\u201d(253)\nSimilarly with Saint Teresa. \u201cOne day, being in orison,\u201d she\nwrites, \u201cit was granted me to perceive in one instant how all\nthings are seen and contained in God. I did not perceive them in\ntheir proper form, and nevertheless the view I had of them was of\na sovereign clearness, and has remained vividly impressed upon my\nsoul. It is one of the most signal of all the graces which the\nLord has granted me.... The view was so subtile and delicate that\nthe understanding cannot grasp it.\u201d(254)\nShe goes on to tell how it was as if the Deity were an enormous and\nsovereignly limpid diamond, in which all our actions were contained in\nsuch a way that their full sinfulness appeared evident as never before. On\nanother day, she relates, while she was reciting the Athanasian Creed,\u2014\n\u201cOur Lord made me comprehend in what way it is that one God can be\nin three Persons. He made me see it so clearly that I remained as\nextremely surprised as I was comforted, ... and now, when I think\nof the holy Trinity, or hear It spoken of, I understand how the\nthree adorable Persons form only one God and I experience an\nunspeakable happiness.\u201d\nOn still another occasion, it was given to Saint Teresa to see and\nunderstand in what wise the Mother of God had been assumed into her place\nin Heaven.(255)\nThe deliciousness of some of these states seems to be beyond anything\nknown in ordinary consciousness. It evidently involves organic\nsensibilities, for it is spoken of as something too extreme to be borne,\nand as verging on bodily pain.(256) But it is too subtle and piercing a\ndelight for ordinary words to denote. God\u2019s touches, the wounds of his\nspear, references to ebriety and to nuptial union have to figure in the\nphraseology by which it is shadowed forth. Intellect and senses both swoon\naway in these highest states of ecstasy. \u201cIf our understanding\ncomprehends,\u201d says Saint Teresa, \u201cit is in a mode which remains unknown to\nit, and it can understand nothing of what it comprehends. For my own part,\nI do not believe that it does comprehend, because, as I said, it does not\nunderstand itself to do so. I confess that it is all a mystery in which I\nam lost.\u201d(257) In the condition called _raptus_ or ravishment by\ntheologians, breathing and circulation are so depressed that it is a\nquestion among the doctors whether the soul be or be not temporarily\ndissevered from the body. One must read Saint Teresa\u2019s descriptions and\nthe very exact distinctions which she makes, to persuade one\u2019s self that\none is dealing, not with imaginary experiences, but with phenomena which,\nhowever rare, follow perfectly definite psychological types.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nTo the medical mind these ecstasies signify nothing but suggested and\nimitated hypnoid states, on an intellectual basis of superstition, and a\ncorporeal one of degeneration and hysteria. Undoubtedly these pathological\nconditions have existed in many and possibly in all the cases, but that\nfact tells us nothing about the value for knowledge of the consciousness\nwhich they induce. To pass a spiritual judgment upon these states, we must\nnot content ourselves with superficial medical talk, but inquire into\ntheir fruits for life.\nTheir fruits appear to have been various. Stupefaction, for one thing,\nseems not to have been altogether absent as a result. You may remember the\nhelplessness in the kitchen and schoolroom of poor Margaret Mary Alacoque.\nMany other ecstatics would have perished but for the care taken of them by\nadmiring followers. The \u201cother\u2010worldliness\u201d encouraged by the mystical\nconsciousness makes this over\u2010abstraction from practical life peculiarly\nliable to befall mystics in whom the character is naturally passive and\nthe intellect feeble; but in natively strong minds and characters we find\nquite opposite results. The great Spanish mystics, who carried the habit\nof ecstasy as far as it has often been carried, appear for the most part\nto have shown indomitable spirit and energy, and all the more so for the\ntrances in which they indulged.\nSaint Ignatius was a mystic, but his mysticism made him assuredly one of\nthe most powerfully practical human engines that ever lived. Saint John of\nthe Cross, writing of the intuitions and \u201ctouches\u201d by which God reaches\nthe substance of the soul, tells us that\u2014\n\u201cThey enrich it marvelously. A single one of them may be\nsufficient to abolish at a stroke certain imperfections of which\nthe soul during its whole life had vainly tried to rid itself, and\nto leave it adorned with virtues and loaded with supernatural\ngifts. A single one of these intoxicating consolations may reward\nit for all the labors undergone in its life\u2014even were they\nnumberless. Invested with an invincible courage, filled with an\nimpassioned desire to suffer for its God, the soul then is seized\nwith a strange torment\u2014that of not being allowed to suffer\nenough.\u201d(258)\nSaint Teresa is as emphatic, and much more detailed. You may perhaps\nremember a passage I quoted from her in my first lecture.(259) There are\nmany similar pages in her autobiography. Where in literature is a more\nevidently veracious account of the formation of a new centre of spiritual\nenergy, than is given in her description of the effects of certain\necstasies which in departing leave the soul upon a higher level of\nemotional excitement?\n\u201cOften, infirm and wrought upon with dreadful pains before the\necstasy, the soul emerges from it full of health and admirably\ndisposed for action ... as if God had willed that the body itself,\nalready obedient to the soul\u2019s desires, should share in the soul\u2019s\nhappiness.... The soul after such a favor is animated with a\ndegree of courage so great that if at that moment its body should\nbe torn to pieces for the cause of God, it would feel nothing but\nthe liveliest comfort. Then it is that promises and heroic\nresolutions spring up in profusion in us, soaring desires, horror\nof the world, and the clear perception of our proper\nnothingness.... What empire is comparable to that of a soul who,\nfrom this sublime summit to which God has raised her, sees all the\nthings of earth beneath her feet, and is captivated by no one of\nthem? How ashamed she is of her former attachments! How amazed at\nher blindness! What lively pity she feels for those whom she\nrecognizes still shrouded in the darkness!... She groans at having\never been sensitive to points of honor, at the illusion that made\nher ever see as honor what the world calls by that name. Now she\nsees in this name nothing more than an immense lie of which the\nworld remains a victim. She discovers, in the new light from\nabove, that in genuine honor there is nothing spurious, that to be\nfaithful to this honor is to give our respect to what deserves to\nbe respected really, and to consider as nothing, or as less than\nnothing, whatsoever perishes and is not agreeable to God.... She\nlaughs when she sees grave persons, persons of orison, caring for\npoints of honor for which she now feels profoundest contempt. It\nis suitable to the dignity of their rank to act thus, they\npretend, and it makes them more useful to others. But she knows\nthat in despising the dignity of their rank for the pure love of\nGod they would do more good in a single day than they would effect\nin ten years by preserving it.... She laughs at herself that there\nshould ever have been a time in her life when she made any case of\nmoney, when she ever desired it.... Oh! if human beings might only\nagree together to regard it as so much useless mud, what harmony\nwould then reign in the world! With what friendship we would all\ntreat each other if our interest in honor and in money could but\ndisappear from earth! For my own part, I feel as if it would be a\nremedy for all our ills.\u201d(260)\nMystical conditions may, therefore, render the soul more energetic in the\nlines which their inspiration favors. But this could be reckoned an\nadvantage only in case the inspiration were a true one. If the inspiration\nwere erroneous, the energy would be all the more mistaken and misbegotten.\nSo we stand once more before that problem of truth which confronted us at\nthe end of the lectures on saintliness. You will remember that we turned\nto mysticism precisely to get some light on truth. Do mystical states\nestablish the truth of those theological affections in which the saintly\nlife has its root?\nIn spite of their repudiation of articulate self\u2010description, mystical\nstates in general assert a pretty distinct theoretic drift. It is possible\nto give the outcome of the majority of them in terms that point in\ndefinite philosophical directions. One of these directions is optimism,\nand the other is monism. We pass into mystical states from out of ordinary\nconsciousness as from a less into a more, as from a smallness into a\nvastness, and at the same time as from an unrest to a rest. We feel them\nas reconciling, unifying states. They appeal to the yes\u2010function more than\nto the no\u2010function in us. In them the unlimited absorbs the limits and\npeacefully closes the account. Their very denial of every adjective you\nmay propose as applicable to the ultimate truth,\u2014He, the Self, the Atman,\nis to be described by \u201cNo! no!\u201d only, say the Upanishads,(261)\u2014though it\nseems on the surface to be a no\u2010function, is a denial made on behalf of a\ndeeper yes. Whoso calls the Absolute anything in particular, or says that\nit is _this_, seems implicitly to shut it off from being _that_\u2014it is as\nif he lessened it. So we deny the \u201cthis,\u201d negating the negation which it\nseems to us to imply, in the interests of the higher affirmative attitude\nby which we are possessed. The fountain\u2010head of Christian mysticism is\nDionysius the Areopagite. He describes the absolute truth by negatives\nexclusively.\n\u201cThe cause of all things is neither soul nor intellect; nor has it\nimagination, opinion, or reason, or intelligence; nor is it reason\nor intelligence; nor is it spoken or thought. It is neither\nnumber, nor order, nor magnitude, nor littleness, nor equality,\nnor inequality, nor similarity, nor dissimilarity. It neither\nstands, nor moves, nor rests.... It is neither essence, nor\neternity, nor time. Even intellectual contact does not belong to\nit. It is neither science nor truth. It is not even royalty or\nwisdom; not one; not unity; not divinity or goodness; nor even\nspirit as we know it,\u201d etc., _ad libitum_.(262)\nBut these qualifications are denied by Dionysius, not because the truth\nfalls short of them, but because it so infinitely excels them. It is above\nthem. It is _super_\u2010lucent, _super_\u2010splendent, _super_\u2010essential,\n_super_\u2010sublime, _super_ everything that can be named. Like Hegel in his\nlogic, mystics journey towards the positive pole of truth only by the\n\u201cMethode der Absoluten Negativit\u00e4t.\u201d(263)\nThus come the paradoxical expressions that so abound in mystical writings.\nAs when Eckhart tells of the still desert of the Godhead, \u201cwhere never was\nseen difference, neither Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost, where there is no\none at home, yet where the spark of the soul is more at peace than in\nitself.\u201d(264) As when Boehme writes of the Primal Love, that \u201cit may fitly\nbe compared to Nothing, for it is deeper than any Thing, and is as nothing\nwith respect to all things, forasmuch as it is not comprehensible by any\nof them. And because it is nothing respectively, it is therefore free from\nall things, and is that only good, which a man cannot express or utter\nwhat it is, there being nothing to which it may be compared, to express it\nby.\u201d(265) Or as when Angelus Silesius sings:\u2014\n\u201cGott ist ein lauter Nichts, ihn r\u00fchrt kein Nun noch Hier;\nJe mehr du nach ihm greiffst, je mehr entwind er dir.\u201d(266)\nTo this dialectical use, by the intellect, of negation as a mode of\npassage towards a higher kind of affirmation, there is correlated the\nsubtlest of moral counterparts in the sphere of the personal will. Since\ndenial of the finite self and its wants, since asceticism of some sort, is\nfound in religious experience to be the only doorway to the larger and\nmore blessed life, this moral mystery intertwines and combines with the\nintellectual mystery in all mystical writings.\n\u201cLove,\u201d continues Behmen, is Nothing, for \u201cwhen thou art gone\nforth wholly from the Creature and from that which is visible, and\nart become Nothing to all that is Nature and Creature, then thou\nart in that eternal One, which is God himself, and then thou shalt\nfeel within thee the highest virtue of Love.... The treasure of\ntreasures for the soul is where she goeth out of the Somewhat into\nthat Nothing out of which all things may be made. The soul here\nsaith, _I have nothing_, for I am utterly stripped and naked; _I\ncan do nothing_, for I have no manner of power, but am as water\npoured out; _I am nothing_, for all that I am is no more than an\nimage of Being, and only God is to me I AM; and so, sitting down\nin my own Nothingness, I give glory to the eternal Being, and\n_will nothing_ of myself, that so God may will all in me, being\nunto me my God and all things.\u201d(267)\nIn Paul\u2019s language, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. Only when\nI become as nothing can God enter in and no difference between his life\nand mine remain outstanding.(268)\nThis overcoming of all the usual barriers between the individual and the\nAbsolute is the great mystic achievement. In mystic states we both become\none with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness. This is the\neverlasting and triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by\ndifferences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in\nChristian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so\nthat there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought\nto make a critic stop and think, and which brings it about that the\nmystical classics have, as has been said, neither birthday nor native\nland. Perpetually telling of the unity of man with God, their speech\nantedates languages, and they do not grow old.(269)\n\u201cThat art Thou!\u201d say the Upanishads, and the Vedantists add: \u201cNot a part,\nnot a mode of That, but identically That, that absolute Spirit of the\nWorld.\u201d \u201cAs pure water poured into pure water remains the same, thus, O\nGautama, is the Self of a thinker who knows. Water in water, fire in fire,\nether in ether, no one can distinguish them; likewise a man whose mind has\nentered into the Self.\u201d(270) \u201c \u2018Every man,\u2019 says the Sufi Gulshan\u2010R\u00e2z,\n\u2018whose heart is no longer shaken by any doubt, knows with certainty that\nthere is no being save only One.... In his divine majesty the _me_, the\n_we_, the _thou_, are not found, for in the One there can be no\ndistinction. Every being who is annulled and entirely separated from\nhimself, hears resound outside of him this voice and this echo: _I am\nGod_: he has an eternal way of existing, and is no longer subject to\ndeath.\u2019 \u201d(271) In the vision of God, says Plotinus, \u201cwhat sees is not our\nreason, but something prior and superior to our reason.... He who thus\nsees does not properly see, does not distinguish or imagine two things. He\nchanges, he ceases to be himself, preserves nothing of himself. Absorbed\nin God, he makes but one with him, like a centre of a circle coinciding\nwith another centre.\u201d(272) \u201cHere,\u201d writes Suso, \u201cthe spirit dies, and yet\nis all alive in the marvels of the Godhead ... and is lost in the\nstillness of the glorious dazzling obscurity and of the naked simple\nunity. It is in this modeless _where_ that the highest bliss is to be\nfound.\u201d(273) \u201cIch bin so gross als Gott,\u201d sings Angelus Silesius again,\n\u201cEr ist als ich so klein; Er kann nicht \u00fcber mich, ich unter ihm nicht\nsein.\u201d(274)\nIn mystical literature such self\u2010contradictory phrases as \u201cdazzling\nobscurity,\u201d \u201cwhispering silence,\u201d \u201cteeming desert,\u201d are continually met\nwith. They prove that not conceptual speech, but music rather, is the\nelement through which we are best spoken to by mystical truth. Many\nmystical scriptures are indeed little more than musical compositions.\n\u201cHe who would hear the voice of Nada, \u2018the Soundless Sound,\u2019 and\ncomprehend it, he has to learn the nature of Dh\u00e2ran\u00e2.... When to\nhimself his form appears unreal, as do on waking all the forms he\nsees in dreams; when he has ceased to hear the many, he may\ndiscern the ONE\u2014the inner sound which kills the outer.... For then\nthe soul will hear, and will remember. And then to the inner ear\nwill speak THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE.... And now thy _Self_ is lost\nin SELF, _thyself_ unto THYSELF, merged in that SELF from which\nthou first didst radiate.... Behold! thou hast become the Light,\nthou hast become the Sound, thou art thy Master and thy God. Thou\nart THYSELF the object of thy search: the VOICE unbroken, that\nresounds throughout eternities, exempt from change, from sin\nexempt, the seven sounds in one, the VOICE OF THE SILENCE. _Om tat\nSat._\u201d(275)\nThese words, if they do not awaken laughter as you receive them, probably\nstir chords within you which music and language touch in common. Music\ngives us ontological messages which non\u2010musical criticism is unable to\ncontradict, though it may laugh at our foolishness in minding them. There\nis a verge of the mind which these things haunt; and whispers therefrom\nmingle with the operations of our understanding, even as the waters of the\ninfinite ocean send their waves to break among the pebbles that lie upon\nour shores.\n\u201cHere begins the sea that ends not till the world\u2019s end. Where we\nstand,\nCould we know the next high sea\u2010mark set beyond these waves that\ngleam,\nWe should know what never man hath known, nor eye of man hath\nscanned....\nAh, but here man\u2019s heart leaps, yearning towards the gloom with\nventurous glee,\nFrom the shore that hath no shore beyond it, set in all the\nsea.\u201d(276)\nThat doctrine, for example, that eternity is timeless, that our\n\u201cimmortality,\u201d if we live in the eternal, is not so much future as already\nnow and here, which we find so often expressed to\u2010day in certain\nphilosophic circles, finds its support in a \u201chear, hear!\u201d or an \u201camen,\u201d\nwhich floats up from that mysteriously deeper level.(277) We recognize the\npasswords to the mystical region as we hear them, but we cannot use them\nourselves; it alone has the keeping of \u201cthe password primeval.\u201d(278)\nI have now sketched with extreme brevity and insufficiency, but as fairly\nas I am able in the time allowed, the general traits of the mystic range\nof consciousness. _It is on the whole pantheistic and optimistic, or at\nleast the opposite of pessimistic. It is anti\u2010naturalistic, and harmonizes\nbest with twice\u2010bornness and so\u2010called other\u2010worldly states of mind._\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nMy next task is to inquire whether we can invoke it as authoritative. Does\nit furnish any _warrant for the truth_ of the twice\u2010bornness and\nsupernaturality and pantheism which it favors? I must give my answer to\nthis question as concisely as I can.\nIn brief my answer is this,\u2014and I will divide it into three parts:\u2014\n(1) Mystical states, when well developed, usually are, and have the right\nto be, absolutely authoritative over the individuals to whom they come.\n(2) No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for those\nwho stand outside of them to accept their revelations uncritically.\n(3) They break down the authority of the non\u2010mystical or rationalistic\nconsciousness, based upon the understanding and the senses alone. They\nshow it to be only one kind of consciousness. They open out the\npossibility of other orders of truth, in which, so far as anything in us\nvitally responds to them, we may freely continue to have faith.\nI will take up these points one by one.\n1.\nAs a matter of psychological fact, mystical states of a well\u2010pronounced\nand emphatic sort _are_ usually authoritative over those who have\nthem.(279) They have been \u201cthere,\u201d and know. It is vain for rationalism to\ngrumble about this. If the mystical truth that comes to a man proves to be\na force that he can live by, what mandate have we of the majority to order\nhim to live in another way? We can throw him into a prison or a madhouse,\nbut we cannot change his mind\u2014we commonly attach it only the more\nstubbornly to its beliefs.(280) It mocks our utmost efforts, as a matter\nof fact, and in point of logic it absolutely escapes our jurisdiction. Our\nown more \u201crational\u201d beliefs are based on evidence exactly similar in\nnature to that which mystics quote for theirs. Our senses, namely, have\nassured us of certain states of fact; but mystical experiences are as\ndirect perceptions of fact for those who have them as any sensations ever\nwere for us. The records show that even though the five senses be in\nabeyance in them, they are absolutely sensational in their epistemological\nquality, if I may be pardoned the barbarous expression,\u2014that is, they are\nface to face presentations of what seems immediately to exist.\nThe mystic is, in short, _invulnerable_, and must be left, whether we\nrelish it or not, in undisturbed enjoyment of his creed. Faith, says\nTolstoy, is that by which men live. And faith\u2010state and mystic state are\npractically convertible terms.\n2.\nBut I now proceed to add that mystics have no right to claim that we ought\nto accept the deliverance of their peculiar experiences, if we are\nourselves outsiders and feel no private call thereto. The utmost they can\never ask of us in this life is to admit that they establish a presumption.\nThey form a consensus and have an unequivocal outcome; and it would be\nodd, mystics might say, if such a unanimous type of experience should\nprove to be altogether wrong. At bottom, however, this would only be an\nappeal to numbers, like the appeal of rationalism the other way; and the\nappeal to numbers has no logical force. If we acknowledge it, it is for\n\u201csuggestive,\u201d not for logical reasons: we follow the majority because to\ndo so suits our life.\nBut even this presumption from the unanimity of mystics is far from being\nstrong. In characterizing mystic states as pantheistic, optimistic, etc.,\nI am afraid I over\u2010simplified the truth. I did so for expository reasons,\nand to keep the closer to the classic mystical tradition. The classic\nreligious mysticism, it now must be confessed, is only a \u201cprivileged\ncase.\u201d It is an _extract_, kept true to type by the selection of the\nfittest specimens and their preservation in \u201cschools.\u201d It is carved out\nfrom a much larger mass; and if we take the larger mass as seriously as\nreligious mysticism has historically taken itself, we find that the\nsupposed unanimity largely disappears. To begin with, even religious\nmysticism itself, the kind that accumulates traditions and makes schools,\nis much less unanimous than I have allowed. It has been both ascetic and\nantinomianly self\u2010indulgent within the Christian church.(281) It is\ndualistic in Sankhya, and monistic in Vedanta philosophy. I called it\npantheistic; but the great Spanish mystics are anything but pantheists.\nThey are with few exceptions non\u2010metaphysical minds, for whom \u201cthe\ncategory of personality\u201d is absolute. The \u201cunion\u201d of man with God is for\nthem much more like an occasional miracle than like an original\nidentity.(282) How different again, apart from the happiness common to\nall, is the mysticism of Walt Whitman, Edward Carpenter, Richard\nJefferies, and other naturalistic pantheists, from the more distinctively\nChristian sort.(283) The fact is that the mystical feeling of enlargement,\nunion, and emancipation has no specific intellectual content whatever of\nits own. It is capable of forming matrimonial alliances with material\nfurnished by the most diverse philosophies and theologies, provided only\nthey can find a place in their framework for its peculiar emotional mood.\nWe have no right, therefore, to invoke its prestige as distinctively in\nfavor of any special belief, such as that in absolute idealism, or in the\nabsolute monistic identity, or in the absolute goodness, of the world. It\nis only relatively in favor of all these things\u2014it passes out of common\nhuman consciousness in the direction in which they lie.\nSo much for religious mysticism proper. But more remains to be told, for\nreligious mysticism is only one half of mysticism. The other half has no\naccumulated traditions except those which the text\u2010books on insanity\nsupply. Open any one of these, and you will find abundant cases in which\n\u201cmystical ideas\u201d are cited as characteristic symptoms of enfeebled or\ndeluded states of mind. In delusional insanity, paranoia, as they\nsometimes call it, we may have a _diabolical_ mysticism, a sort of\nreligious mysticism turned upside down. The same sense of ineffable\nimportance in the smallest events, the same texts and words coming with\nnew meanings, the same voices and visions and leadings and missions, the\nsame controlling by extraneous powers; only this time the emotion is\npessimistic: instead of consolations we have desolations; the meanings are\ndreadful; and the powers are enemies to life. It is evident that from the\npoint of view of their psychological mechanism, the classic mysticism and\nthese lower mysticisms spring from the same mental level, from that great\nsubliminal or transmarginal region of which science is beginning to admit\nthe existence, but of which so little is really known. That region\ncontains every kind of matter: \u201cseraph and snake\u201d abide there side by\nside. To come from thence is no infallible credential. What comes must be\nsifted and tested, and run the gauntlet of confrontation with the total\ncontext of experience, just like what comes from the outer world of sense.\nIts value must be ascertained by empirical methods, so long as we are not\nmystics ourselves.\nOnce more, then, I repeat that non\u2010mystics are under no obligation to\nacknowledge in mystical states a superior authority conferred on them by\ntheir intrinsic nature.(284)\n3.\nYet, I repeat once more, the existence of mystical states absolutely\noverthrows the pretension of non\u2010mystical states to be the sole and\nultimate dictators of what we may believe. As a rule, mystical states\nmerely add a supersensuous meaning to the ordinary outward data of\nconsciousness. They are excitements like the emotions of love or ambition,\ngifts to our spirit by means of which facts already objectively before us\nfall into a new expressiveness and make a new connection with our active\nlife. They do not contradict these facts as such, or deny anything that\nour senses have immediately seized.(285) It is the rationalistic critic\nrather who plays the part of denier in the controversy, and his denials\nhave no strength, for there never can be a state of facts to which new\nmeaning may not truthfully be added, provided the mind ascend to a more\nenveloping point of view. It must always remain an open question whether\nmystical states may not possibly be such superior points of view, windows\nthrough which the mind looks out upon a more extensive and inclusive\nworld. The difference of the views seen from the different mystical\nwindows need not prevent us from entertaining this supposition. The wider\nworld would in that case prove to have a mixed constitution like that of\nthis world, that is all. It would have its celestial and its infernal\nregions, its tempting and its saving moments, its valid experiences and\nits counterfeit ones, just as our world has them; but it would be a wider\nworld all the same. We should have to use its experiences by selecting and\nsubordinating and substituting just as is our custom in this ordinary\nnaturalistic world; we should be liable to error just as we are now; yet\nthe counting in of that wider world of meanings, and the serious dealing\nwith it, might, in spite of all the perplexity, be indispensable stages in\nour approach to the final fullness of the truth.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn this shape, I think, we have to leave the subject. Mystical states\nindeed wield no authority due simply to their being mystical states. But\nthe higher ones among them point in directions to which the religious\nsentiments even of non\u2010mystical men incline. They tell of the supremacy of\nthe ideal, of vastness, of union, of safety, and of rest. They offer us\n_hypotheses_, hypotheses which we may voluntarily ignore, but which as\nthinkers we cannot possibly upset. The supernaturalism and optimism to\nwhich they would persuade us may, interpreted in one way or another, be\nafter all the truest of insights into the meaning of this life.\n\u201cOh, the little more, and how much it is; and the little less, and what\nworlds away!\u201d It may be that possibility and permission of this sort are\nall that the religious consciousness requires to live on. In my last\nlecture I shall have to try to persuade you that this is the case.\nMeanwhile, however, I am sure that for many of my readers this diet is too\nslender. If supernaturalism and inner union with the divine are true, you\nthink, then not so much permission, as compulsion to believe, ought to be\nfound. Philosophy has always professed to prove religious truth by\ncoercive argument; and the construction of philosophies of this kind has\nalways been one favorite function of the religious life, if we use this\nterm in the large historic sense. But religious philosophy is an enormous\nsubject, and in my next lecture I can only give that brief glance at it\nwhich my limits will allow.\nLECTURE XVIII. PHILOSOPHY.\nThe subject of Saintliness left us face to face with the question, Is the\nsense of divine presence a sense of anything objectively true? We turned\nfirst to mysticism for an answer, and found that although mysticism is\nentirely willing to corroborate religion, it is too private (and also too\nvarious) in its utterances to be able to claim a universal authority. But\nphilosophy publishes results which claim to be universally valid if they\nare valid at all, so we now turn with our question to philosophy. Can\nphilosophy stamp a warrant of veracity upon the religious man\u2019s sense of\nthe divine?\nI imagine that many of you at this point begin to indulge in guesses at\nthe goal to which I am tending. I have undermined the authority of\nmysticism, you say, and the next thing I shall probably do is to seek to\ndiscredit that of philosophy. Religion, you expect to hear me conclude, is\nnothing but an affair of faith, based either on vague sentiment, or on\nthat vivid sense of the reality of things unseen of which in my second\nlecture and in the lecture on Mysticism I gave so many examples. It is\nessentially private and individualistic; it always exceeds our powers of\nformulation; and although attempts to pour its contents into a philosophic\nmould will probably always go on, men being what they are, yet these\nattempts are always secondary processes which in no way add to the\nauthority, or warrant the veracity, of the sentiments from which they\nderive their own stimulus and borrow whatever glow of conviction they may\nthemselves possess. In short, you suspect that I am planning to defend\nfeeling at the expense of reason, to rehabilitate the primitive and\nunreflective, and to dissuade you from the hope of any Theology worthy of\nthe name.\nTo a certain extent I have to admit that you guess rightly. I do believe\nthat feeling is the deeper source of religion, and that philosophic and\ntheological formulas are secondary products, like translations of a text\ninto another tongue. But all such statements are misleading from their\nbrevity, and it will take the whole hour for me to explain to you exactly\nwhat I mean.\nWhen I call theological formulas secondary products, I mean that in a\nworld in which no religious feeling had ever existed, I doubt whether any\nphilosophic theology could ever have been framed. I doubt if dispassionate\nintellectual contemplation of the universe, apart from inner unhappiness\nand need of deliverance on the one hand and mystical emotion on the other,\nwould ever have resulted in religious philosophies such as we now possess.\nMen would have begun with animistic explanations of natural fact, and\ncriticised these away into scientific ones, as they actually have done. In\nthe science they would have left a certain amount of \u201cpsychical research,\u201d\neven as they now will probably have to re\u2010admit a certain amount. But\nhigh\u2010flying speculations like those of either dogmatic or idealistic\ntheology, these they would have had no motive to venture on, feeling no\nneed of commerce with such deities. These speculations must, it seems to\nme, be classed as over\u2010beliefs, buildings\u2010out performed by the intellect\ninto directions of which feeling originally supplied the hint.\nBut even if religious philosophy had to have its first hint supplied by\nfeeling, may it not have dealt in a superior way with the matter which\nfeeling suggested? Feeling is private and dumb, and unable to give an\naccount of itself. It allows that its results are mysteries and enigmas,\ndeclines to justify them rationally, and on occasion is willing that they\nshould even pass for paradoxical and absurd. Philosophy takes just the\nopposite attitude. Her aspiration is to reclaim from mystery and paradox\nwhatever territory she touches. To find an escape from obscure and wayward\npersonal persuasion to truth objectively valid for all thinking men has\never been the intellect\u2019s most cherished ideal. To redeem religion from\nunwholesome privacy, and to give public status and universal right of way\nto its deliverances, has been reason\u2019s task.\nI believe that philosophy will always have opportunity to labor at this\ntask.(286) We are thinking beings, and we cannot exclude the intellect\nfrom participating in any of our functions. Even in soliloquizing with\nourselves, we construe our feelings intellectually. Both our personal\nideals and our religious and mystical experiences must be interpreted\ncongruously with the kind of scenery which our thinking mind inhabits. The\nphilosophic climate of our time inevitably forces its own clothing on us.\nMoreover, we must exchange our feelings with one another, and in doing so\nwe have to speak, and to use general and abstract verbal formulas.\nConceptions and constructions are thus a necessary part of our religion;\nand as moderator amid the clash of hypotheses, and mediator among the\ncriticisms of one man\u2019s constructions by another, philosophy will always\nhave much to do. It would be strange if I disputed this, when these very\nlectures which I am giving are (as you will see more clearly from now\nonwards) a laborious attempt to extract from the privacies of religious\nexperience some general facts which can be defined in formulas upon which\neverybody may agree.\nReligious experience, in other words, spontaneously and inevitably\nengenders myths, superstitions, dogmas, creeds, and metaphysical\ntheologies, and criticisms of one set of these by the adherents of\nanother. Of late, impartial classifications and comparisons have become\npossible, alongside of the denunciations and anathemas by which the\ncommerce between creeds used exclusively to be carried on. We have the\nbeginnings of a \u201cScience of Religions,\u201d so\u2010called; and if these lectures\ncould ever be accounted a crumb\u2010like contribution to such a science, I\nshould be made very happy.\nBut all these intellectual operations, whether they be constructive or\ncomparative and critical, presuppose immediate experiences as their\nsubject\u2010matter. They are interpretative and inductive operations,\noperations after the fact, consequent upon religious feeling, not\nco\u00f6rdinate with it, not independent of what it ascertains.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe intellectualism in religion which I wish to discredit pretends to be\nsomething altogether different from this. It assumes to construct\nreligious objects out of the resources of logical reason alone, or of\nlogical reason drawing rigorous inference from non\u2010subjective facts. It\ncalls its conclusions dogmatic theology, or philosophy of the absolute, as\nthe case may be; it does not call them science of religions. It reaches\nthem in an a priori way, and warrants their veracity.\nWarranted systems have ever been the idols of aspiring souls. All\u2010\ninclusive, yet simple; noble, clean, luminous, stable, rigorous,\ntrue;\u2014what more ideal refuge could there be than such a system would offer\nto spirits vexed by the muddiness and accidentality of the world of\nsensible things? Accordingly, we find inculcated in the theological\nschools of to\u2010day, almost as much as in those of the fore\u2010time, a disdain\nfor merely possible or probable truth, and of results that only private\nassurance can grasp. Scholastics and idealists both express this disdain.\nPrincipal John Caird, for example, writes as follows in his Introduction\nto the Philosophy of Religion:\u2014\n\u201cReligion must indeed be a thing of the heart; but in order to\nelevate it from the region of subjective caprice and waywardness,\nand to distinguish between that which is true and false in\nreligion, we must appeal to an objective standard. That which\nenters the heart must first be discerned by the intelligence to be\n_true_. It must be seen as having in its own nature a _right_ to\ndominate feeling, and as constituting the principle by which\nfeeling must be judged.(287) In estimating the religious character\nof individuals, nations, or races, the first question is, not how\nthey feel, but what they think and believe\u2014not whether their\nreligion is one which manifests itself in emotions, more or less\nvehement and enthusiastic, but what are the _conceptions_ of God\nand divine things by which these emotions are called forth.\nFeeling is necessary in religion, but it is by the _content_ or\nintelligent basis of a religion, and not by feeling, that its\ncharacter and worth are to be determined.\u201d(288)\nCardinal Newman, in his work, The Idea of a University, gives more\nemphatic expression still to this disdain for sentiment.(289) Theology, he\nsays, is a science in the strictest sense of the word. I will tell you, he\nsays, what it is not\u2014not \u201cphysical evidences\u201d for God, not \u201cnatural\nreligion,\u201d for these are but vague subjective interpretations:\u2014\n\u201cIf,\u201d he continues, \u201cthe Supreme Being is powerful or skillful,\njust so far as the telescope shows power, or the microscope shows\nskill, if his moral law is to be ascertained simply by the\nphysical processes of the animal frame, or his will gathered from\nthe immediate issues of human affairs, if his Essence is just as\nhigh and deep and broad as the universe and no more; if this be\nthe fact, then will I confess that there is no specific science\nabout God, that theology is but a name, and a protest in its\nbehalf an hypocrisy. Then, pious as it is to think of Him, while\nthe pageant of experiment or abstract reasoning passes by, still\nsuch piety is nothing more than a poetry of thought, or an\nornament of language, a certain view taken of Nature which one man\nhas and another has not, which gifted minds strike out, which\nothers see to be admirable and ingenious, and which all would be\nthe better for adopting. It is but the theology of Nature, just as\nwe talk of the _philosophy_ or the _romance_ of history, or the\n_poetry_ of childhood, or the picturesque or the sentimental or\nthe humorous, or any other abstract quality which the genius or\nthe caprice of the individual, or the fashion of the day, or the\nconsent of the world, recognizes in any set of objects which are\nsubjected to its contemplation. I do not see much difference\nbetween avowing that there is no God, and implying that nothing\ndefinite can be known for certain about Him.\u201d\nWhat I mean by Theology, continues Newman, is none of these\nthings: \u201cI simply mean the _Science of God_, or the truths we know\nabout God, put into a system, just as we have a science of the\nstars and call it astronomy, or of the crust of the earth and call\nit geology.\u201d\nIn both these extracts we have the issue clearly set before us: Feeling\nvalid only for the individual is pitted against reason valid universally.\nThe test is a perfectly plain one of fact. Theology based on pure reason\nmust in point of fact convince men universally. If it did not, wherein\nwould its superiority consist? If it only formed sects and schools, even\nas sentiment and mysticism form them, how would it fulfill its programme\nof freeing us from personal caprice and waywardness? This perfectly\ndefinite practical test of the pretensions of philosophy to found religion\non universal reason simplifies my procedure to\u2010day. I need not discredit\nphilosophy by laborious criticism of its arguments. It will suffice if I\nshow that as a matter of history it fails to prove its pretension to be\n\u201cobjectively\u201d convincing. In fact, philosophy does so fail. It does not\nbanish differences; it founds schools and sects just as feeling does. I\nbelieve, in fact, that the logical reason of man operates in this field of\ndivinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or in patriotism, or\nin politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our\npassions or our mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds\narguments for our conviction, for indeed it _has_ to find them. It\namplifies and defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and\nplausibility. It hardly ever engenders it; it cannot now secure it.(290)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLend me your attention while I run through some of the points of the older\nsystematic theology. You find them in both Protestant and Catholic\nmanuals, best of all in the innumerable text\u2010books published since Pope\nLeo\u2019s Encyclical recommending the study of Saint Thomas. I glance first at\nthe arguments by which dogmatic theology establishes God\u2019s existence,\nafter that at those by which it establishes his nature.(291)\nThe arguments for God\u2019s existence have stood for hundreds of years with\nthe waves of unbelieving criticism breaking against them, never totally\ndiscrediting them in the ears of the faithful, but on the whole slowly and\nsurely washing out the mortar from between their joints. If you have a God\nalready whom you believe in, these arguments confirm you. If you are\natheistic, they fail to set you right. The proofs are various. The\n\u201ccosmological\u201d one, so\u2010called, reasons from the contingence of the world\nto a First Cause which must contain whatever perfections the world itself\ncontains. The \u201cargument from design\u201d reasons, from the fact that Nature\u2019s\nlaws are mathematical, and her parts benevolently adapted to each other,\nthat this cause is both intellectual and benevolent. The \u201cmoral argument\u201d\nis that the moral law presupposes a lawgiver. The \u201cargument _ex consensu\ngentium_\u201d is that the belief in God is so widespread as to be grounded in\nthe rational nature of man, and should therefore carry authority with it.\nAs I just said, I will not discuss these arguments technically. The bare\nfact that all idealists since Kant have felt entitled either to scout or\nto neglect them shows that they are not solid enough to serve as\nreligion\u2019s all\u2010sufficient foundation. Absolutely impersonal reasons would\nbe in duty bound to show more general convincingness. Causation is indeed\ntoo obscure a principle to bear the weight of the whole structure of\ntheology. As for the argument from design, see how Darwinian ideas have\nrevolutionized it. Conceived as we now conceive them, as so many fortunate\nescapes from almost limitless processes of destruction, the benevolent\nadaptations which we find in Nature suggest a deity very different from\nthe one who figured in the earlier versions of the argument.(292)\nThe fact is that these arguments do but follow the combined suggestions of\nthe facts and of our feeling. They prove nothing rigorously. They only\ncorroborate our pre\u2010existent partialities.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIf philosophy can do so little to establish God\u2019s existence, how stands it\nwith her efforts to define his attributes? It is worth while to look at\nthe attempts of systematic theology in this direction.\nSince God is First Cause, this science of sciences says, he\ndiffers from all his creatures in possessing existence _a se_.\nFrom this \u201ca\u2010se\u2010ity\u201d on God\u2019s part, theology deduces by mere logic\nmost of his other perfections. For instance, he must be both\n_necessary_ and _absolute_, cannot not be, and cannot in any way\nbe determined by anything else. This makes Him absolutely\nunlimited from without, and unlimited also from within; for\nlimitation is non\u2010being; and God is being itself. This\nunlimitedness makes God infinitely perfect. Moreover, God is\n_One_, and _Only_, for the infinitely perfect can admit no peer.\nHe is _Spiritual_, for were He composed of physical parts, some\nother power would have to combine them into the total, and his\naseity would thus be contradicted. He is therefore both simple and\nnon\u2010physical in nature. He is _simple metaphysically_ also, that\nis to say, his nature and his existence cannot be distinct, as\nthey are in finite substances which share their formal natures\nwith one another, and are individual only in their material\naspect. Since God is one and only, his _essentia_ and his _esse_\nmust be given at one stroke. This excludes from his being all\nthose distinctions, so familiar in the world of finite things,\nbetween potentiality and actuality, substance and accidents, being\nand activity, existence and attributes. We can talk, it is true,\nof God\u2019s powers, acts, and attributes, but these discriminations\nare only \u201cvirtual,\u201d and made from the human point of view. In God\nall these points of view fall into an absolute identity of being.\nThis absence of all potentiality in God obliges Him to be\n_immutable_. He is actuality, through and through. Were there\nanything potential about Him, He would either lose or gain by its\nactualization, and either loss or gain would contradict his\nperfection. He cannot, therefore, change. Furthermore, He is\n_immense_, _boundless_; for could He be outlined in space, He\nwould be composite, and this would contradict his indivisibility.\nHe is therefore _omnipresent_, indivisibly there, at every point\nof space. He is similarly wholly present at every point of\ntime,\u2014in other words _eternal_. For if He began in time, He would\nneed a prior cause, and that would contradict his aseity. If He\nended, it would contradict his necessity. If He went through any\nsuccession, it would contradict his immutability.\nHe has _intelligence_ and _will_ and every other creature\u2010\nperfection, for _we_ have them, and _effectus nequit superare\ncausam_. In Him, however, they are absolutely and eternally in\nact, and their _object_, since God can be bounded by naught that\nis external, can primarily be nothing else than God himself. He\nknows himself, then, in one eternal indivisible act, and wills\nhimself with an infinite self\u2010pleasure.(293) Since He must of\nlogical necessity thus love and will himself, He cannot be called\n\u201cfree\u201d _ad intra_, with the freedom of contrarieties that\ncharacterizes finite creatures. _Ad extra_, however, or with\nrespect to his creation, God is free. He cannot _need_ to create,\nbeing perfect in being and in happiness already. He _wills_ to\ncreate, then, by an absolute freedom.\nBeing thus a substance endowed with intellect and will and\nfreedom, God is a _person_; and a _living_ person also, for He is\nboth object and subject of his own activity, and to be this\ndistinguishes the living from the lifeless. He is thus absolutely\n_self\u2010sufficient_: his _self\u2010knowledge_ and _self\u2010love_ are both\nof them infinite and adequate, and need no extraneous conditions\nto perfect them.\nHe is _omniscient_, for in knowing himself as Cause He knows all\ncreature things and events by implication. His knowledge is\n_previsive_, for He is present to all time. Even our free acts are\nknown beforehand to Him, for otherwise his wisdom would admit of\nsuccessive moments of enrichment, and this would contradict his\nimmutability. He is _omnipotent_ for everything that does not\ninvolve logical contradiction. He can make _being_\u2014in other words\nhis power includes _creation_. If what He creates were made of his\nown substance, it would have to be infinite in essence, as that\nsubstance is; but it is finite; so it must be non\u2010divine in\nsubstance. If it were made of a substance, an eternally existing\nmatter, for example, which God found there to his hand, and to\nwhich He simply gave its form, that would contradict God\u2019s\ndefinition as First Cause, and make Him a mere mover of something\ncaused already. The things he creates, then, He creates _ex\nnihilo_, and gives them absolute being as so many finite\nsubstances additional to himself. The forms which he imprints upon\nthem have their prototypes in his ideas. But as in God there is no\nsuch thing as multiplicity, and as these ideas for us are\nmanifold, we must distinguish the ideas as they are in God and the\nway in which our minds externally imitate them. We must attribute\nthem to Him only in a _terminative_ sense, as differing aspects,\nfrom the finite point of view, of his unique essence.\nGod of course is holy, good, and just. He can do no evil, for He\nis positive being\u2019s fullness, and evil is negation. It is true\nthat He has created physical evil in places, but only as a means\nof wider good, for _bonum totius pr\u00e6eminet bonum partis_. Moral\nevil He cannot will, either as end or means, for that would\ncontradict his holiness. By creating free beings He _permits_ it\nonly, neither his justice nor his goodness obliging Him to prevent\nthe recipients of freedom from misusing the gift.\nAs regards God\u2019s purpose in creating, primarily it can only have\nbeen to exercise his absolute freedom by the manifestation to\nothers of his glory. From this it follows that the others must be\nrational beings, capable in the first place of knowledge, love,\nand honor, and in the second place of happiness, for the knowledge\nand love of God is the mainspring of felicity. In so far forth one\nmay say that God\u2019s secondary purpose in creating is _love_.\nI will not weary you by pursuing these metaphysical determinations\nfarther, into the mysteries of God\u2019s Trinity, for example. What I have\ngiven will serve as a specimen of the orthodox philosophical theology of\nboth Catholics and Protestants. Newman, filled with enthusiasm at God\u2019s\nlist of perfections, continues the passage which I began to quote to you\nby a couple of pages of a rhetoric so magnificent that I can hardly\nrefrain from adding them, in spite of the inroad they would make upon our\ntime.(294) He first enumerates God\u2019s attributes sonorously, then\ncelebrates his ownership of everything in earth and Heaven, and the\ndependence of all that happens upon his permissive will. He gives us\nscholastic philosophy \u201ctouched with emotion,\u201d and every philosophy should\nbe touched with emotion to be rightly understood. Emotionally, then,\ndogmatic theology is worth something to minds of the type of Newman\u2019s. It\nwill aid us to estimate what it is worth intellectually, if at this point\nI make a short digression.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWhat God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. The Continental\nschools of philosophy have too often overlooked the fact that man\u2019s\nthinking is organically connected with his conduct. It seems to me to be\nthe chief glory of English and Scottish thinkers to have kept the organic\nconnection in view. The guiding principle of British philosophy has in\nfact been that every difference must _make_ a difference, every\ntheoretical difference somewhere issue in a practical difference, and that\nthe best method of discussing points of theory is to begin by ascertaining\nwhat practical difference would result from one alternative or the other\nbeing true. What is the particular truth in question _known as_? In what\nfacts does it result? What is its cash\u2010value in terms of particular\nexperience? This is the characteristic English way of taking up a\nquestion. In this way, you remember, Locke takes up the question of\npersonal identity. What you mean by it is just your chain of particular\nmemories, says he. That is the only concretely verifiable part of its\nsignificance. All further ideas about it, such as the oneness or manyness\nof the spiritual substance on which it is based, are therefore void of\nintelligible meaning; and propositions touching such ideas may be\nindifferently affirmed or denied. So Berkeley with his \u201cmatter.\u201d The cash\u2010\nvalue of matter is our physical sensations. That is what it is known as,\nall that we concretely verify of its conception. That, therefore, is the\nwhole meaning of the term \u201cmatter\u201d\u2014any other pretended meaning is mere\nwind of words. Hume does the same thing with causation. It is known as\nhabitual antecedence, and as tendency on our part to look for something\ndefinite to come. Apart from this practical meaning it has no significance\nwhatever, and books about it may be committed to the flames, says Hume.\nDugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, James Mill, John Mill, and Professor\nBain, have followed more or less consistently the same method; and\nShadworth Hodgson has used the principle with full explicitness. When all\nis said and done, it was English and Scotch writers, and not Kant, who\nintroduced \u201cthe critical method\u201d into philosophy, the one method fitted to\nmake philosophy a study worthy of serious men. For what seriousness can\npossibly remain in debating philosophic propositions that will never make\nan appreciable difference to us in action? And what could it matter, if\nall propositions were practically indifferent, which of them we should\nagree to call true or which false?\nAn American philosopher of eminent originality, Mr. Charles Sanders\nPeirce, has rendered thought a service by disentangling from the\nparticulars of its application the principle by which these men were\ninstinctively guided, and by singling it out as fundamental and giving to\nit a Greek name. He calls it the principle of _pragmatism_, and he defends\nit somewhat as follows:(295)\u2014\nThought in movement has for its only conceivable motive the attainment of\nbelief, or thought at rest. Only when our thought about a subject has\nfound its rest in belief can our action on the subject firmly and safely\nbegin. Beliefs, in short, are rules for action; and the whole function of\nthinking is but one step in the production of active habits. If there were\nany part of a thought that made no difference in the thought\u2019s practical\nconsequences, then that part would be no proper element of the thought\u2019s\nsignificance. To develop a thought\u2019s meaning we need therefore only\ndetermine what conduct it is fitted to produce; that conduct is for us its\nsole significance; and the tangible fact at the root of all our thought\u2010\ndistinctions is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in\nanything but a possible difference of practice. To attain perfect\nclearness in our thoughts of an object, we need then only consider what\nsensations, immediate or remote, we are conceivably to expect from it, and\nwhat conduct we must prepare in case the object should be true. Our\nconception of these practical consequences is for us the whole of our\nconception of the object, so far as that conception has positive\nsignificance at all.\nThis is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. Such a\nprinciple will help us on this occasion to decide, among the various\nattributes set down in the scholastic inventory of God\u2019s perfections,\nwhether some be not far less significant than others.\nIf, namely, we apply the principle of pragmatism to God\u2019s metaphysical\nattributes, strictly so called, as distinguished from his moral\nattributes, I think that, even were we forced by a coercive logic to\nbelieve them, we still should have to confess them to be destitute of all\nintelligible significance. Take God\u2019s aseity, for example; or his\nnecessariness; his immateriality; his \u201csimplicity\u201d or superiority to the\nkind of inner variety and succession which we find in finite beings, his\nindivisibility, and lack of the inner distinctions of being and activity,\nsubstance and accident, potentiality and actuality, and the rest; his\nrepudiation of inclusion in a genus; his actualized infinity; his\n\u201cpersonality,\u201d apart from the moral qualities which it may comport; his\nrelations to evil being permissive and not positive; his self\u2010sufficiency,\nself\u2010love, and absolute felicity in himself:\u2014candidly speaking, how do\nsuch qualities as these make any definite connection with our life? And if\nthey severally call for no distinctive adaptations of our conduct, what\nvital difference can it possibly make to a man\u2019s religion whether they be\ntrue or false?\nFor my own part, although I dislike to say aught that may grate upon\ntender associations, I must frankly confess that even though these\nattributes were faultlessly deduced, I cannot conceive of its being of the\nsmallest consequence to us religiously that any one of them should be\ntrue. Pray, what specific act can I perform in order to adapt myself the\nbetter to God\u2019s simplicity? Or how does it assist me to plan my behavior,\nto know that his happiness is anyhow absolutely complete? In the middle of\nthe century just past, Mayne Reid was the great writer of books of out\u2010of\u2010\ndoor adventure. He was forever extolling the hunters and field\u2010observers\nof living animals\u2019 habits, and keeping up a fire of invective against the\n\u201ccloset\u2010naturalists,\u201d as he called them, the collectors and classifiers,\nand handlers of skeletons and skins. When I was a boy, I used to think\nthat a closet\u2010naturalist must be the vilest type of wretch under the sun.\nBut surely the systematic theologians are the closet\u2010naturalists of the\ndeity, even in Captain Mayne Reid\u2019s sense. What is their deduction of\nmetaphysical attributes but a shuffling and matching of pedantic\ndictionary\u2010adjectives, aloof from morals, aloof from human needs,\nsomething that might be worked out from the mere word \u201cGod\u201d by one of\nthose logical machines of wood and brass which recent ingenuity has\ncontrived as well as by a man of flesh and blood. They have the trail of\nthe serpent over them. One feels that in the theologians\u2019 hands, they are\nonly a set of titles obtained by a mechanical manipulation of synonyms;\nverbality has stepped into the place of vision, professionalism into that\nof life. Instead of bread we have a stone; instead of a fish, a serpent.\nDid such a conglomeration of abstract terms give really the gist of our\nknowledge of the deity, schools of theology might indeed continue to\nflourish, but religion, vital religion, would have taken its flight from\nthis world. What keeps religion going is something else than abstract\ndefinitions and systems of concatenated adjectives, and something\ndifferent from faculties of theology and their professors. All these\nthings are after\u2010effects, secondary accretions upon those phenomena of\nvital conversation with the unseen divine, of which I have shown you so\nmany instances, renewing themselves _in s\u00e6cula s\u00e6culorum_ in the lives of\nhumble private men.\nSo much for the metaphysical attributes of God! From the point of view of\npractical religion, the metaphysical monster which they offer to our\nworship is an absolutely worthless invention of the scholarly mind.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWhat shall we now say of the attributes called moral? Pragmatically, they\nstand on an entirely different footing. They positively determine fear and\nhope and expectation, and are foundations for the saintly life. It needs\nbut a glance at them to show how great is their significance.\nGod\u2019s holiness, for example: being holy, God can will nothing but the\ngood. Being omnipotent, he can secure its triumph. Being omniscient, he\ncan see us in the dark. Being just, he can punish us for what he sees.\nBeing loving, he can pardon too. Being unalterable, we can count on him\nsecurely. These qualities enter into connection with our life, it is\nhighly important that we should be informed concerning them. That God\u2019s\npurpose in creation should be the manifestation of his glory is also an\nattribute which has definite relations to our practical life. Among other\nthings it has given a definite character to worship in all Christian\ncountries. If dogmatic theology really does prove beyond dispute that a\nGod with characters like these exists, she may well claim to give a solid\nbasis to religious sentiment. But verily, how stands it with her\narguments?\nIt stands with them as ill as with the arguments for his existence. Not\nonly do post\u2010Kantian idealists reject them root and branch, but it is a\nplain historic fact that they never have converted any one who has found\nin the moral complexion of the world, as he experienced it, reasons for\ndoubting that a good God can have framed it. To prove God\u2019s goodness by\nthe scholastic argument that there is no non\u2010being in his essence would\nsound to such a witness simply silly.\nNo! the book of Job went over this whole matter once for all and\ndefinitively. Ratiocination is a relatively superficial and unreal path to\nthe deity: \u201cI will lay mine hand upon my mouth; I have heard of Thee by\nthe hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee.\u201d An intellect\nperplexed and baffled, yet a trustful sense of presence\u2014such is the\nsituation of the man who is sincere with himself and with the facts, but\nwho remains religious still.(296)\nWe must therefore, I think, bid a definitive good\u2010by to dogmatic theology.\nIn all sincerity our faith must do without that warrant. Modern idealism,\nI repeat, has said good\u2010by to this theology forever. Can modern idealism\ngive faith a better warrant, or must she still rely on her poor self for\nwitness?\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe basis of modern idealism is Kant\u2019s doctrine of the Transcendental Ego\nof Apperception. By this formidable term Kant merely meant the fact that\nthe consciousness \u201cI think them\u201d must (potentially or actually) accompany\nall our objects. Former skeptics had said as much, but the \u201cI\u201d in question\nhad remained for them identified with the personal individual. Kant\nabstracted and depersonalized it, and made it the most universal of all\nhis categories, although for Kant himself the Transcendental Ego had no\ntheological implications.\nIt was reserved for his successors to convert Kant\u2019s notion of\n_Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt_, or abstract consciousness, into an infinite\nconcrete self\u2010consciousness which is the soul of the world, and in which\nour sundry personal self\u2010consciousnesses have their being. It would lead\nme into technicalities to show you even briefly how this transformation\nwas in point of fact effected. Suffice it to say that in the Hegelian\nschool, which to\u2010day so deeply influences both British and American\nthinking, two principles have borne the brunt of the operation.\nThe first of these principles is that the old logic of identity never\ngives us more than a post\u2010mortem dissection of _disjecta membra_, and that\nthe fullness of life can be construed to thought only by recognizing that\nevery object which our thought may propose to itself involves the notion\nof some other object which seems at first to negate the first one.\nThe second principle is that to be conscious of a negation is already\nvirtually to be beyond it. The mere asking of a question or expression of\na dissatisfaction proves that the answer or the satisfaction is already\nimminent; the finite, realized as such, is already the infinite _in\nposse_.\nApplying these principles, we seem to get a propulsive force into our\nlogic which the ordinary logic of a bare, stark self\u2010identity in each\nthing never attains to. The objects of our thought now _act_ within our\nthought, act as objects act when given in experience. They change and\ndevelop. They introduce something other than themselves along with them;\nand this other, at first only ideal or potential, presently proves itself\nalso to be actual. It supersedes the thing at first supposed, and both\nverifies and corrects it, in developing the fullness of its meaning.\nThe program is excellent; the universe _is_ a place where things are\nfollowed by other things that both correct and fulfill them; and a logic\nwhich gave us something like this movement of fact would express truth far\nbetter than the traditional school\u2010logic, which never gets of its own\naccord from anything to anything else, and registers only predictions and\nsubsumptions, or static resemblances and differences. Nothing could be\nmore unlike the methods of dogmatic theology than those of this new logic.\nLet me quote in illustration some passages from the Scottish\ntranscendentalist whom I have already named.\n\u201cHow are we to conceive,\u201d Principal Caird writes, \u201cof the reality\nin which all intelligence rests?\u201d He replies: \u201cTwo things may\nwithout difficulty be proved, viz., that this reality is an\nabsolute Spirit, and conversely that it is only in communion with\nthis absolute Spirit or Intelligence that the finite Spirit can\nrealize itself. It is absolute; for the faintest movement of human\nintelligence would be arrested, if it did not presuppose the\nabsolute reality of intelligence, of thought itself. Doubt or\ndenial themselves presuppose and indirectly affirm it. When I\npronounce anything to be true, I pronounce it, indeed, to be\nrelative to thought, but not to be relative to my thought, or to\nthe thought of any other individual mind. From the existence of\nall individual minds as such I can abstract; I can think them\naway. But that which I cannot think away is thought or self\u2010\nconsciousness itself, in its independence and absoluteness, or, in\nother words, an Absolute Thought or Self\u2010Consciousness.\u201d\nHere, you see, Principal Caird makes the transition which Kant did not\nmake: he converts the omnipresence of consciousness in general as a\ncondition of \u201ctruth\u201d being anywhere possible, into an omnipresent\nuniversal consciousness, which he identifies with God in his concreteness.\nHe next proceeds to use the principle that to acknowledge your limits is\nin essence to be beyond them; and makes the transition to the religious\nexperience of individuals in the following words:\u2014\n\u201cIf [Man] were only a creature of transient sensations and\nimpulses, of an ever coming and going succession of intuitions,\nfancies, feelings, then nothing could ever have for him the\ncharacter of objective truth or reality. But it is the prerogative\nof man\u2019s spiritual nature that he can yield himself up to a\nthought and will that are infinitely larger than his own. As a\nthinking, self\u2010conscious being, indeed, he may be said, by his\nvery nature, to live in the atmosphere of the Universal Life. As a\nthinking being, it is possible for me to suppress and quell in my\nconsciousness every movement of self\u2010assertion, every notion and\nopinion that is merely mine, every desire that belongs to me as\nthis particular Self, and to become the pure medium of a thought\nthat is universal\u2014in one word, to live no more my own life, but\nlet my consciousness be possessed and suffused by the Infinite and\nEternal life of spirit. And yet it is just in this renunciation of\nself that I truly gain myself, or realize the highest\npossibilities of my own nature. For whilst in one sense we give up\nself to live the universal and absolute life of reason, yet that\nto which we thus surrender ourselves is in reality our truer self.\nThe life of absolute reason is not a life that is foreign to us.\u201d\nNevertheless, Principal Caird goes on to say, so far as we are able\noutwardly to realize this doctrine, the balm it offers remains incomplete.\nWhatever we may be _in posse_, the very best of us _in actu_ falls very\nshort of being absolutely divine. Social morality, love, and self\u2010\nsacrifice even, merge our Self only in some other finite self or selves.\nThey do not quite identify it with the Infinite. Man\u2019s ideal destiny,\ninfinite in abstract logic, might thus seem in practice forever\nunrealizable.\n\u201cIs there, then,\u201d our author continues, \u201cno solution of the\ncontradiction between the ideal and the actual? We answer, There\nis such a solution, but in order to reach it we are carried beyond\nthe sphere of morality into that of religion. It may be said to be\nthe essential characteristic of religion as contrasted with\nmorality, that it changes aspiration into fruition, anticipation\ninto realization; that instead of leaving man in the interminable\npursuit of a vanishing ideal, it makes him the actual partaker of\na divine or infinite life. Whether we view religion from the human\nside or the divine\u2014as the surrender of the soul to God, or as the\nlife of God in the soul\u2014in either aspect it is of its very essence\nthat the Infinite has ceased to be a far\u2010off vision, and has\nbecome a present reality. The very first pulsation of the\nspiritual life, when we rightly apprehend its significance, is the\nindication that the division between the Spirit and its object has\nvanished, that the ideal has become real, that the finite has\nreached its goal and become suffused with the presence and life of\nthe Infinite.\n\u201cOneness of mind and will with the divine mind and will is not the\nfuture hope and aim of religion, but its very beginning and birth\nin the soul. To enter on the religious life is to terminate the\nstruggle. In that act which constitutes the beginning of the\nreligious life\u2014call it faith, or trust, or self\u2010surrender, or by\nwhatever name you will\u2014there is involved the identification of the\nfinite with a life which is eternally realized. It is true indeed\nthat the religious life is progressive; but understood in the\nlight of the foregoing idea, religious progress is not progress\n_towards_, but _within_ the sphere of the Infinite. It is not the\nvain attempt by endless finite additions or increments to become\npossessed of infinite wealth, but it is the endeavor, by the\nconstant exercise of spiritual activity, to appropriate that\ninfinite inheritance of which we are already in possession. The\nwhole future of the religious life is given in its beginning, but\nit is given implicitly. The position of the man who has entered on\nthe religious life is that evil, error, imperfection, do not\nreally belong to him: they are excrescences which have no organic\nrelation to his true nature: they are already virtually, as they\nwill be actually, suppressed and annulled, and in the very process\nof being annulled they become the means of spiritual progress.\nThough he is not exempt from temptation and conflict, [yet] in\nthat inner sphere in which his true life lies, the struggle is\nover, the victory already achieved. It is not a finite but an\ninfinite life which the spirit lives. Every pulse\u2010beat of its\n[existence] is the expression and realization of the life of\nGod.\u201d(297)\nYou will readily admit that no description of the phenomena of the\nreligious consciousness could be better than these words of your lamented\npreacher and philosopher. They reproduce the very rapture of those crises\nof conversion of which we have been hearing; they utter what the mystic\nfelt but was unable to communicate; and the saint, in hearing them,\nrecognizes his own experience. It is indeed gratifying to find the content\nof religion reported so unanimously. But when all is said and done, has\nPrincipal Caird\u2014and I only use him as an example of that whole mode of\nthinking\u2014transcended the sphere of feeling and of the direct experience of\nthe individual, and laid the foundations of religion in impartial reason?\nHas he made religion universal by coercive reasoning, transformed it from\na private faith into a public certainty? Has he rescued its affirmations\nfrom obscurity and mystery?\nI believe that he has done nothing of the kind, but that he has simply\nreaffirmed the individual\u2019s experiences in a more generalized vocabulary.\nAnd again, I can be excused from proving technically that the\ntranscendentalist reasonings fail to make religion universal, for I can\npoint to the plain fact that a majority of scholars, even religiously\ndisposed ones, stubbornly refuse to treat them as convincing. The whole of\nGermany, one may say, has positively rejected the Hegelian argumentation.\nAs for Scotland, I need only mention Professor Fraser\u2019s and Professor\nPringle\u2010Pattison\u2019s memorable criticisms, with which so many of you are\nfamiliar.(298) Once more, I ask, if transcendental idealism were as\nobjectively and absolutely rational as it pretends to be, could it\npossibly fail so egregiously to be persuasive?\nWhat religion reports, you must remember, always purports to be a fact of\nexperience: the divine is actually present, religion says, and between it\nand ourselves relations of give and take are actual. If definite\nperceptions of fact like this cannot stand upon their own feet, surely\nabstract reasoning cannot give them the support they are in need of.\nConceptual processes can class facts, define them, interpret them; but\nthey do not produce them, nor can they reproduce their individuality.\nThere is always a _plus_, a _thisness_, which feeling alone can answer\nfor. Philosophy in this sphere is thus a secondary function, unable to\nwarrant faith\u2019s veracity, and so I revert to the thesis which I announced\nat the beginning of this lecture.\nIn all sad sincerity I think we must conclude that the attempt to\ndemonstrate by purely intellectual processes the truth of the deliverances\nof direct religious experience is absolutely hopeless.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIt would be unfair to philosophy, however, to leave her under this\nnegative sentence. Let me close, then, by briefly enumerating what she\n_can_ do for religion. If she will abandon metaphysics and deduction for\ncriticism and induction, and frankly transform herself from theology into\nscience of religions, she can make herself enormously useful.\nThe spontaneous intellect of man always defines the divine which it feels\nin ways that harmonize with its temporary intellectual prepossessions.\nPhilosophy can by comparison eliminate the local and the accidental from\nthese definitions. Both from dogma and from worship she can remove\nhistoric incrustations. By confronting the spontaneous religious\nconstructions with the results of natural science, philosophy can also\neliminate doctrines that are now known to be scientifically absurd or\nincongruous.\nSifting out in this way unworthy formulations, she can leave a residuum of\nconceptions that at least are possible. With these she can deal as\n_hypotheses_, testing them in all the manners, whether negative or\npositive, by which hypotheses are ever tested. She can reduce their\nnumber, as some are found more open to objection. She can perhaps become\nthe champion of one which she picks out as being the most closely verified\nor verifiable. She can refine upon the definition of this hypothesis,\ndistinguishing between what is innocent over\u2010belief and symbolism in the\nexpression of it, and what is to be literally taken. As a result, she can\noffer mediation between different believers, and help to bring about\nconsensus of opinion. She can do this the more successfully, the better\nshe discriminates the common and essential from the individual and local\nelements of the religious beliefs which she compares.\nI do not see why a critical Science of Religions of this sort might not\neventually command as general a public adhesion as is commanded by a\nphysical science. Even the personally non\u2010religious might accept its\nconclusions on trust, much as blind persons now accept the facts of\noptics\u2014it might appear as foolish to refuse them. Yet as the science of\noptics has to be fed in the first instance, and continually verified\nlater, by facts experienced by seeing persons; so the science of religions\nwould depend for its original material on facts of personal experience,\nand would have to square itself with personal experience through all its\ncritical reconstructions. It could never get away from concrete life, or\nwork in a conceptual vacuum. It would forever have to confess, as every\nscience confesses, that the subtlety of nature flies beyond it, and that\nits formulas are but approximations. Philosophy lives in words, but truth\nand fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation.\nThere is in the living act of perception always something that glimmers\nand twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too\nlate. No one knows this as well as the philosopher. He must fire his\nvolley of new vocables out of his conceptual shotgun, for his profession\ncondemns him to this industry, but he secretly knows the hollowness and\nirrelevancy. His formulas are like stereoscopic or kinetoscopic\nphotographs seen outside the instrument; they lack the depth, the motion,\nthe vitality. In the religious sphere, in particular, belief that formulas\nare true can never wholly take the place of personal experience.\nIn my next lecture I will try to complete my rough description of\nreligious experience; and in the lecture after that, which is the last\none, I will try my own hand at formulating conceptually the truth to which\nit is a witness.\nLECTURE XIX. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS.\nWe have wound our way back, after our excursion through mysticism and\nphilosophy, to where we were before: the uses of religion, its uses to the\nindividual who has it, and the uses of the individual himself to the\nworld, are the best arguments that truth is in it. We return to the\nempirical philosophy: the true is what works well, even though the\nqualification \u201con the whole\u201d may always have to be added. In this lecture\nwe must revert to description again, and finish our picture of the\nreligious consciousness by a word about some of its other characteristic\nelements. Then, in a final lecture, we shall be free to make a general\nreview and draw our independent conclusions.\nThe first point I will speak of is the part which the \u00e6sthetic life plays\nin determining one\u2019s choice of a religion. Men, I said awhile ago,\ninvoluntarily intellectualize their religious experience. They need\nformulas, just as they need fellowship in worship. I spoke, therefore, too\ncontemptuously of the pragmatic uselessness of the famous scholastic list\nof attributes of the deity, for they have one use which I neglected to\nconsider. The eloquent passage in which Newman enumerates them(299) puts\nus on the track of it. Intoning them as he would intone a cathedral\nservice, he shows how high is their \u00e6sthetic value. It enriches our bare\npiety to carry these exalted and mysterious verbal additions just as it\nenriches a church to have an organ and old brasses, marbles and frescoes\nand stained windows. Epithets lend an atmosphere and overtones to our\ndevotion. They are like a hymn of praise and service of glory, and may\nsound the more sublime for being incomprehensible. Minds like\nNewman\u2019s(300) grow as jealous of their credit as heathen priests are of\nthat of the jewelry and ornaments that blaze upon their idols.\nAmong the buildings\u2010out of religion which the mind spontaneously indulges\nin, the \u00e6sthetic motive must never be forgotten. I promised to say nothing\nof ecclesiastical systems in these lectures. I may be allowed, however, to\nput in a word at this point on the way in which their satisfaction of\ncertain \u00e6sthetic needs contributes to their hold on human nature. Although\nsome persons aim most at intellectual purity and simplification, for\nothers _richness_ is the supreme imaginative requirement.(301) When one\u2019s\nmind is strongly of this type, an individual religion will hardly serve\nthe purpose. The inner need is rather of something institutional and\ncomplex, majestic in the hierarchic interrelatedness of its parts, with\nauthority descending from stage to stage, and at every stage objects for\nadjectives of mystery and splendor, derived in the last resort from the\nGodhead who is the fountain and culmination of the system. One feels then\nas if in presence of some vast incrusted work of jewelry or architecture;\none hears the multitudinous liturgical appeal; one gets the honorific\nvibration coming from every quarter. Compared with such a noble\ncomplexity, in which ascending and descending movements seem in no way to\njar upon stability, in which no single item, however humble, is\ninsignificant, because so many august institutions hold it in its place,\nhow flat does evangelical Protestantism appear, how bare the atmosphere of\nthose isolated religious lives whose boast it is that \u201cman in the bush\nwith God may meet.\u201d(302) What a pulverization and leveling of what a\ngloriously piled\u2010up structure! To an imagination used to the perspectives\nof dignity and glory, the naked gospel scheme seems to offer an almshouse\nfor a palace.\nIt is much like the patriotic sentiment of those brought up in ancient\nempires. How many emotions must be frustrated of their object, when one\ngives up the titles of dignity, the crimson lights and blare of brass, the\ngold embroidery, the plumed troops, the fear and trembling, and puts up\nwith a president in a black coat who shakes hands with you, and comes, it\nmay be, from a \u201chome\u201d upon a veldt or prairie with one sitting\u2010room and a\nBible on its centre\u2010table. It pauperizes the monarchical imagination!\nThe strength of these \u00e6sthetic sentiments makes it rigorously impossible,\nit seems to me, that Protestantism, however superior in spiritual\nprofundity it may be to Catholicism, should at the present day succeed in\nmaking many converts from the more venerable ecclesiasticism. The latter\noffers a so much richer pasturage and shade to the fancy, has so many\ncells with so many different kinds of honey, is so indulgent in its\nmultiform appeals to human nature, that Protestantism will always show to\nCatholic eyes the almshouse physiognomy. The bitter negativity of it is to\nthe Catholic mind incomprehensible. To intellectual Catholics many of the\nantiquated beliefs and practices to which the Church gives countenance\nare, if taken literally, as childish as they are to Protestants. But they\nare childish in the pleasing sense of \u201cchildlike\u201d\u2014innocent and amiable,\nand worthy to be smiled on in consideration of the undeveloped condition\nof the dear people\u2019s intellects. To the Protestant, on the contrary, they\nare childish in the sense of being idiotic falsehoods. He must stamp out\ntheir delicate and lovable redundancy, leaving the Catholic to shudder at\nhis literalness. He appears to the latter as morose as if he were some\nhard\u2010eyed, numb, monotonous kind of reptile. The two will never understand\neach other\u2014their centres of emotional energy are too different. Rigorous\ntruth and human nature\u2019s intricacies are always in need of a mutual\ninterpreter.(303) So much for the \u00e6sthetic diversities in the religious\nconsciousness.\nIn most books on religion, three things are represented as its most\nessential elements. These are Sacrifice, Confession, and Prayer. I must\nsay a word in turn of each of these elements, though briefly. First of\nSacrifice.\nSacrifices to gods are omnipresent in primeval worship; but, as cults have\ngrown refined, burnt offerings and the blood of he\u2010goats have been\nsuperseded by sacrifices more spiritual in their nature. Judaism, Islam,\nand Buddhism get along without ritual sacrifice; so does Christianity,\nsave in so far as the notion is preserved in transfigured form in the\nmystery of Christ\u2019s atonement. These religions substitute offerings of the\nheart, renunciations of the inner self, for all those vain oblations. In\nthe ascetic practices which Islam, Buddhism, and the older Christianity\nencourage we see how indestructible is the idea that sacrifice of some\nsort is a religious exercise. In lecturing on asceticism I spoke of its\nsignificance as symbolic of the sacrifices which life, whenever it is\ntaken strenuously, calls for.(304) But, as I said my say about those, and\nas these lectures expressly avoid earlier religious usages and questions\nof derivation, I will pass from the subject of Sacrifice altogether and\nturn to that of Confession.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn regard to Confession I will also be most brief, saying my word about it\npsychologically, not historically. Not nearly as widespread as sacrifice,\nit corresponds to a more inward and moral stage of sentiment. It is part\nof the general system of purgation and cleansing which one feels one\u2019s\nself in need of, in order to be in right relations to one\u2019s deity. For him\nwho confesses, shams are over and realities have begun; he has\nexteriorized his rottenness. If he has not actually got rid of it, he at\nleast no longer smears it over with a hypocritical show of virtue\u2014he lives\nat least upon a basis of veracity. The complete decay of the practice of\nconfession in Anglo\u2010Saxon communities is a little hard to account for.\nReaction against popery is of course the historic explanation, for in\npopery confession went with penances and absolution, and other\ninadmissible practices. But on the side of the sinner himself it seems as\nif the need ought to have been too great to accept so summary a refusal of\nits satisfaction. One would think that in more men the shell of secrecy\nwould have had to open, the pent\u2010in abscess to burst and gain relief, even\nthough the ear that heard the confession were unworthy. The Catholic\nchurch, for obvious utilitarian reasons, has substituted auricular\nconfession to one priest for the more radical act of public confession. We\nEnglish\u2010speaking Protestants, in the general self\u2010reliance and\nunsociability of our nature, seem to find it enough if we take God alone\ninto our confidence.(305)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next topic on which I must comment is Prayer,\u2014and this time it must be\nless briefly. We have heard much talk of late against prayer, especially\nagainst prayers for better weather and for the recovery of sick people. As\nregards prayers for the sick, if any medical fact can be considered to\nstand firm, it is that in certain environments prayer may contribute to\nrecovery, and should be encouraged as a therapeutic measure. Being a\nnormal factor of moral health in the person, its omission would be\ndeleterious. The case of the weather is different. Notwithstanding the\nrecency of the opposite belief,(306) every one now knows that droughts and\nstorms follow from physical antecedents, and that moral appeals cannot\navert them. But petitional prayer is only one department of prayer; and if\nwe take the word in the wider sense as meaning every kind of inward\ncommunion or conversation with the power recognized as divine, we can\neasily see that scientific criticism leaves it untouched.\nPrayer in this wide sense is the very soul and essence of religion.\n\u201cReligion,\u201d says a liberal French theologian, \u201cis an intercourse, a\nconscious and voluntary relation, entered into by a soul in distress with\nthe mysterious power upon which it feels itself to depend, and upon which\nits fate is contingent. This intercourse with God is realized by prayer.\nPrayer is religion in act; that is, prayer is real religion. It is prayer\nthat distinguishes the religious phenomenon from such similar or\nneighboring phenomena as purely moral or \u00e6sthetic sentiment. Religion is\nnothing if it be not the vital act by which the entire mind seeks to save\nitself by clinging to the principle from which it draws its life. This act\nis prayer, by which term I understand no vain exercise of words, no mere\nrepetition of certain sacred formul\u00e6, but the very movement itself of the\nsoul, putting itself in a personal relation of contact with the mysterious\npower of which it feels the presence,\u2014it may be even before it has a name\nby which to call it. Wherever this interior prayer is lacking, there is no\nreligion; wherever, on the other hand, this prayer rises and stirs the\nsoul, even in the absence of forms or of doctrines, we have living\nreligion. One sees from this why \u2018natural religion,\u2019 so\u2010called, is not\nproperly a religion. It cuts man off from prayer. It leaves him and God in\nmutual remoteness, with no intimate commerce, no interior dialogue, no\ninterchange, no action of God in man, no return of man to God. At bottom\nthis pretended religion is only a philosophy. Born at epochs of\nrationalism, of critical investigations, it never was anything but an\nabstraction. An artificial and dead creation, it reveals to its examiner\nhardly one of the characters proper to religion.\u201d(307)\nIt seems to me that the entire series of our lectures proves the truth of\nM. Sabatier\u2019s contention. The religious phenomenon, studied as an inner\nfact, and apart from ecclesiastical or theological complications, has\nshown itself to consist everywhere, and at all its stages, in the\nconsciousness which individuals have of an intercourse between themselves\nand higher powers with which they feel themselves to be related. This\nintercourse is realized at the time as being both active and mutual. If it\nbe not effective; if it be not a give and take relation; if nothing be\nreally transacted while it lasts; if the world is in no whit different for\nits having taken place; then prayer, taken in this wide meaning of a sense\nthat _something is transacting_, is of course a feeling of what is\nillusory, and religion must on the whole be classed, not simply as\ncontaining elements of delusion,\u2014these undoubtedly everywhere exist,\u2014but\nas being rooted in delusion altogether, just as materialists and atheists\nhave always said it was. At most there might remain, when the direct\nexperiences of prayer were ruled out as false witnesses, some inferential\nbelief that the whole order of existence must have a divine cause. But\nthis way of contemplating nature, pleasing as it would doubtless be to\npersons of a pious taste, would leave to them but the spectators\u2019 part at\na play, whereas in experimental religion and the prayerful life, we seem\nourselves to be actors, and not in a play, but in a very serious reality.\nThe genuineness of religion is thus indissolubly bound up with the\nquestion whether the prayerful consciousness be or be not deceitful. The\nconviction that something is genuinely transacted in this consciousness is\nthe very core of living religion. As to what is transacted, great\ndifferences of opinion have prevailed. The unseen powers have been\nsupposed, and are yet supposed, to do things which no enlightened man can\nnowadays believe in. It may well prove that the sphere of influence in\nprayer is subjective exclusively, and that what is immediately changed is\nonly the mind of the praying person. But however our opinion of prayer\u2019s\neffects may come to be limited by criticism, religion, in the vital sense\nin which these lectures study it, must stand or fall by the persuasion\nthat effects of some sort genuinely do occur. Through prayer, religion\ninsists, things which cannot be realized in any other manner come about:\nenergy which but for prayer would be bound is by prayer set free and\noperates in some part, be it objective or subjective, of the world of\nfacts.\nThis postulate is strikingly expressed in a letter written by the late\nFrederic W. H. Myers to a friend, who allows me to quote from it. It shows\nhow independent the prayer\u2010instinct is of usual doctrinal complications.\nMr. Myers writes:\u2014\n\u201cI am glad that you have asked me about prayer, because I have\nrather strong ideas on the subject. First consider what are the\nfacts. There exists around us a spiritual universe, and that\nuniverse is in actual relation with the material. From the\nspiritual universe comes the energy which maintains the material;\nthe energy which makes the life of each individual spirit. Our\nspirits are supported by a perpetual indrawal of this energy, and\nthe vigor of that indrawal is perpetually changing, much as the\nvigor of our absorption of material nutriment changes from hour to\nhour.\n\u201cI call these \u2018facts\u2019 because I think that some scheme of this\nkind is the only one consistent with our actual evidence; too\ncomplex to summarize here. How, then, should we _act_ on these\nfacts? Plainly we must endeavor to draw in as much spiritual life\nas possible, and we must place our minds in any attitude which\nexperience shows to be favorable to such indrawal. _Prayer_ is the\ngeneral name for that attitude of open and earnest expectancy. If\nwe then ask to _whom_ to pray, the answer (strangely enough) must\nbe that _that_ does not much matter. The prayer is not indeed a\npurely subjective thing;\u2014it means a real increase in intensity of\nabsorption of spiritual power or grace;\u2014but we do not know enough\nof what takes place in the spiritual world to know how the prayer\noperates;\u2014_who_ is cognizant of it, or through what channel the\ngrace is given. Better let children pray to Christ, who is at any\nrate the highest individual spirit of whom we have any knowledge.\nBut it would be rash to say that Christ himself _hears us_; while\nto say that _God_ hears us is merely to restate the first\nprinciple,\u2014that grace flows in from the infinite spiritual world.\u201d\nLet us reserve the question of the truth or falsehood of the belief that\npower is absorbed until the next lecture, when our dogmatic conclusions,\nif we have any, must be reached. Let this lecture still confine itself to\nthe description of phenomena; and as a concrete example of an extreme\nsort, of the way in which the prayerful life may still be led, let me take\na case with which most of you must be acquainted, that of George M\u00fcller of\nBristol, who died in 1898. M\u00fcller\u2019s prayers were of the crassest\npetitional order. Early in life he resolved on taking certain Bible\npromises in literal sincerity, and on letting himself be fed, not by his\nown worldly foresight, but by the Lord\u2019s hand. He had an extraordinarily\nactive and successful career, among the fruits of which were the\ndistribution of over two million copies of the Scripture text, in\ndifferent languages; the equipment of several hundred missionaries; the\ncirculation of more than a hundred and eleven million of scriptural books,\npamphlets, and tracts; the building of five large orphanages, and the\nkeeping and educating of thousands of orphans; finally, the establishment\nof schools in which over a hundred and twenty\u2010one thousand youthful and\nadult pupils were taught. In the course of this work Mr. M\u00fcller received\nand administered nearly a million and a half of pounds sterling, and\ntraveled over two hundred thousand miles of sea and land.(308) During the\nsixty\u2010eight years of his ministry, he never owned any property except his\nclothes and furniture, and cash in hand; and he left, at the age of\neighty\u2010six, an estate worth only a hundred and sixty pounds.\nHis method was to let his general wants be publicly known, but not\nto acquaint other people with the details of his temporary\nnecessities. For the relief of the latter, he prayed directly to\nthe Lord, believing that sooner or later prayers are always\nanswered if one have trust enough. \u201cWhen I lose such a thing as a\nkey,\u201d he writes, \u201cI ask the Lord to direct me to it, and I look\nfor an answer to my prayer; when a person with whom I have made an\nappointment does not come, according to the fixed time, and I\nbegin to be inconvenienced by it, I ask the Lord to be pleased to\nhasten him to me, and I look for an answer; when I do not\nunderstand a passage of the word of God, I lift up my heart to the\nLord that he would be pleased by his Holy Spirit to instruct me,\nand I expect to be taught, though I do not fix the time when, and\nthe manner how it should be; when I am going to minister in the\nWord, I seek help from the Lord, and ... am not cast down, but of\ngood cheer because I look for his assistance.\u201d\nM\u00fcller\u2019s custom was to never run up bills, not even for a week.\n\u201cAs the Lord deals out to us by the day, ... the week\u2019s payment\nmight become due and we have no money to meet it; and thus those\nwith whom we deal might be inconvenienced by us, and we be found\nacting against the commandment of the Lord: \u2018Owe no man anything.\u2019\nFrom this day and henceforward whilst the Lord gives to us our\nsupplies by the day, we purpose to pay at once for every article\nas it is purchased, and never to buy anything except we can pay\nfor it at once, however much it may seem to be needed, and however\nmuch those with whom we deal may wish to be paid only by the\nweek.\u201d\nThe articles needed of which M\u00fcller speaks were the food, fuel,\netc., of his orphanages. Somehow, near as they often come to going\nwithout a meal, they hardly ever seem actually to have done so.\n\u201cGreater and more manifest nearness of the Lord\u2019s presence I have\nnever had than when after breakfast there were no means for dinner\nfor more than a hundred persons; or when after dinner there were\nno means for the tea, and yet the Lord provided the tea; and all\nthis without one single human being having been informed about our\nneed.... Through Grace my mind is so fully assured of the\nfaithfulness of the Lord, that in the midst of the greatest need,\nI am enabled in peace to go about my other work. Indeed, did not\nthe Lord give me this, which is the result of trusting in him, I\nshould scarcely be able to work at all; for it is now\ncomparatively a rare thing that a day comes when I am not in need\nfor one or another part of the work.\u201d(309)\nIn building his orphanages simply by prayer and faith, M\u00fcller\naffirms that his prime motive was \u201cto have something to point to\nas a visible proof that our God and Father is the same faithful\nGod that he ever was,\u2014as willing as ever to prove himself the\nliving God, in our day as formerly, to all that put their trust in\nhim.\u201d(310) For this reason he refused to borrow money for any of\nhis enterprises. \u201cHow does it work when we thus anticipate God by\ngoing our own way? We certainly weaken faith instead of increasing\nit; and each time we work thus a deliverance of our own we find it\nmore and more difficult to trust in God, till at last we give way\nentirely to our natural fallen reason and unbelief prevails. How\ndifferent if one is enabled to wait God\u2019s own time, and to look\nalone to him for help and deliverance! When at last help comes,\nafter many seasons of prayer it may be, how sweet it is, and what\na present recompense! Dear Christian reader, if you have never\nwalked in this path of obedience before, do so now, and you will\nthen know experimentally the sweetness of the joy which results\nfrom it.\u201d(311)\nWhen the supplies came in but slowly, M\u00fcller always considered\nthat this was for the trial of his faith and patience. When his\nfaith and patience had been sufficiently tried, the Lord would\nsend more means. \u201cAnd thus it has proved,\u201d\u2014I quote from his\ndiary,\u2014\u201cfor to\u2010day was given me the sum of 2050 pounds, of which\n2000 are for the building fund [of a certain house], and 50 for\npresent necessities. It is impossible to describe my joy in God\nwhen I received this donation. I was neither excited nor\nsurprised; for I _look out_ for answers to my prayers. _I believe\nthat God hears me._ Yet my heart was so full of joy that I could\nonly _sit_ before God, and admire him, like David in 2 Samuel vii.\nAt last I cast myself flat down upon my face and burst forth in\nthanksgiving to God and in surrendering my heart afresh to him for\nhis blessed service.\u201d(312)\nGeorge M\u00fcller\u2019s is a case extreme in every respect, and in no respect more\nso than in the extraordinary narrowness of the man\u2019s intellectual horizon.\nHis God was, as he often said, his business partner. He seems to have been\nfor M\u00fcller little more than a sort of supernatural clergyman interested in\nthe congregation of tradesmen and others in Bristol who were his saints,\nand in the orphanages and other enterprises, but unpossessed of any of\nthose vaster and wilder and more ideal attributes with which the human\nimagination elsewhere has invested him. M\u00fcller, in short, was absolutely\nunphilosophical. His intensely private and practical conception of his\nrelations with the Deity continued the traditions of the most primitive\nhuman thought.(313) When we compare a mind like his with such a mind as,\nfor example, Emerson\u2019s or Phillips Brooks\u2019s, we see the range which the\nreligions consciousness covers.\nThere is an immense literature relating to answers to petitional prayer.\nThe evangelical journals are filled with such answers, and books are\ndevoted to the subject,(314) but for us M\u00fcller\u2019s case will suffice.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nA less sturdy beggar\u2010like fashion of leading the prayerful life is\nfollowed by innumerable other Christians. Persistence in leaning on the\nAlmighty for support and guidance will, such persons say, bring with it\nproofs, palpable but much more subtle, of his presence and active\ninfluence. The following description of a \u201cled\u201d life, by a German writer\nwhom I have already quoted, would no doubt appear to countless Christians\nin every country as if transcribed from their own personal experience. One\nfinds in this guided sort of life, says Dr. Hilty,\u2014\n\u201cThat books and words (and sometimes people) come to one\u2019s\ncognizance just at the very moment in which one needs them; that\none glides over great dangers as if with shut eyes, remaining\nignorant of what would have terrified one or led one astray, until\nthe peril is past\u2014this being especially the case with temptations\nto vanity and sensuality; that paths on which one ought not to\nwander are, as it were, hedged off with thorns; but that on the\nother side great obstacles are suddenly removed; that when the\ntime has come for something, one suddenly receives a courage that\nformerly failed, or perceives the root of a matter that until then\nwas concealed, or discovers thoughts, talents, yea, even pieces of\nknowledge and insight, in one\u2019s self, of which it is impossible to\nsay whence they come; finally, that persons help us or decline to\nhelp us, favor us or refuse us, as if they had to do so against\ntheir will, so that often those indifferent or even unfriendly to\nus yield us the greatest service and furtherance. (God takes often\ntheir worldly goods, from those whom he leads, at just the right\nmoment, when they threaten to impede the effort after higher\ninterests.)\n\u201cBesides all this, other noteworthy things come to pass, of which\nit is not easy to give account. There is no doubt whatever that\nnow one walks continually through \u2018open doors\u2019 and on the easiest\nroads, with as little care and trouble as it is possible to\nimagine.\n\u201cFurthermore one finds one\u2019s self settling one\u2019s affairs neither\ntoo early nor too late, whereas they were wont to be spoiled by\nuntimeliness, even when the preparations had been well laid. In\naddition to this, one does them with perfect tranquillity of mind,\nalmost as if they were matters of no consequence, like errands\ndone by us for another person, in which case we usually act more\ncalmly than when we act in our own concerns. Again, one finds that\none can _wait_ for everything patiently, and that is one of life\u2019s\ngreat arts. One finds also that each thing comes duly, one thing\nafter the other, so that one gains time to make one\u2019s footing sure\nbefore advancing farther. And then everything occurs to us at the\nright moment, just what we ought to do, etc., and often in a very\nstriking way, just as if a third person were keeping watch over\nthose things which we are in easy danger of forgetting.\n\u201cOften, too, persons are sent to us at the right time, to offer or\nask for what is needed, and what we should never have had the\ncourage or resolution to undertake of our own accord.\n\u201cThrough all these experiences one finds that one is kindly and\ntolerant of other people, even of such as are repulsive,\nnegligent, or ill\u2010willed, for they also are instruments of good in\nGod\u2019s hand, and often most efficient ones. Without these thoughts\nit would be hard for even the best of us always to keep our\nequanimity. But with the consciousness of divine guidance, one\nsees many a thing in life quite differently from what would\notherwise be possible.\n\u201cAll these are things that every human being _knows_, who has had\nexperience of them; and of which the most speaking examples could\nbe brought forward. The highest resources of worldly wisdom are\nunable to attain that which, under divine leading, comes to us of\nits own accord.\u201d(315)\nSuch accounts as this shade away into others where the belief is, not that\nparticular events are tempered more towardly to us by a superintending\nprovidence, as a reward for our reliance, but that by cultivating the\ncontinuous sense of our connection with the power that made things as they\nare, we are tempered more towardly for their reception. The outward face\nof nature need not alter, but the expressions of meaning in it alter. It\nwas dead and is alive again. It is like the difference between looking on\na person without love, or upon the same person with love. In the latter\ncase intercourse springs into new vitality. So when one\u2019s affections keep\nin touch with the divinity of the world\u2019s authorship, fear and egotism\nfall away; and in the equanimity that follows, one finds in the hours, as\nthey succeed each other, a series of purely benignant opportunities. It is\nas if all doors were opened, and all paths freshly smoothed. We meet a new\nworld when we meet the old world in the spirit which this kind of prayer\ninfuses.\nSuch a spirit was that of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.(316) It is that\nof mind\u2010curers, of the transcendentalists, and of the so\u2010called \u201cliberal\u201d\nChristians. As an expression of it, I will quote a page from one of\nMartineau\u2019s sermons:\u2014\n\u201cThe universe, open to the eye to\u2010day, looks as it did a thousand\nyears ago: and the morning hymn of Milton does but tell the beauty\nwith which our own familiar sun dressed the earliest fields and\ngardens of the world. We see what all our fathers saw. And if we\ncannot find God in your house or in mine, upon the roadside or the\nmargin of the sea; in the bursting seed or opening flower; in the\nday duty or the night musing; in the general laugh and the secret\ngrief; in the procession of life, ever entering afresh, and\nsolemnly passing by and dropping off; I do not think we should\ndiscern him any more on the grass of Eden, or beneath the\nmoonlight of Gethsemane. Depend upon it, it is not the want of\ngreater miracles, but of the soul to perceive such as are allowed\nus still, that makes us push all the sanctities into the far\nspaces we cannot reach. The devout feel that wherever God\u2019s hand\nis, _there_ is miracle: and it is simply an indevoutness which\nimagines that only where miracle is, can there be the real hand of\nGod. The customs of Heaven ought surely to be more sacred in our\neyes than its anomalies; the dear old ways, of which the Most High\nis never tired, than the strange things which he does not love\nwell enough ever to repeat. And he who will but discern beneath\nthe sun, as he rises any morning, the supporting finger of the\nAlmighty, may recover the sweet and reverent surprise with which\nAdam gazed on the first dawn in Paradise. It is no outward change,\nno shifting in time or place; but only the loving meditation of\nthe pure in heart, that can reawaken the Eternal from the sleep\nwithin our souls: that can render him a reality again, and\nreassert for him once more his ancient name of \u2018the Living\nGod.\u2019 \u201d(317)\nWhen we see all things in God, and refer all things to him, we read in\ncommon matters superior expressions of meaning. The deadness with which\ncustom invests the familiar vanishes, and existence as a whole appears\ntransfigured. The state of a mind thus awakened from torpor is well\nexpressed in these words, which I take from a friend\u2019s letter:\u2014\n\u201cIf we occupy ourselves in summing up all the mercies and bounties\nwe are privileged to have, we are overwhelmed by their number (so\ngreat that we can imagine ourselves unable to give ourselves time\neven to begin to review the things we may imagine _we have not_).\nWe sum them and realize that _we are actually killed with God\u2019s\nkindness_; that we are surrounded by bounties upon bounties,\nwithout which all would fall. Should we not love it; should we not\nfeel buoyed up by the Eternal Arms?\u201d\nSometimes this realization that facts are of divine sending, instead of\nbeing habitual, is casual, like a mystical experience. Father Gratry gives\nthis instance from his youthful melancholy period:\u2014\n\u201cOne day I had a moment of consolation, because I met with\nsomething which seemed to me ideally perfect. It was a poor\ndrummer beating the tattoo in the streets of Paris. I walked\nbehind him in returning to the school on the evening of a holiday.\nHis drum gave out the tattoo in such a way that, at that moment at\nleast, however peevish I were, I could find no pretext for fault\u2010\nfinding. It was impossible to conceive more nerve or spirit,\nbetter time or measure, more clearness or richness, than were in\nthis drumming. Ideal desire could go no farther in that direction.\nI was enchanted and consoled; the perfection of this wretched act\ndid me good. Good is at least possible, I said, since the ideal\ncan thus sometimes get embodied.\u201d(318)\nIn S\u00e9nancour\u2019s novel of Obermann a similar transient lifting of the veil\nis recorded. In Paris streets, on a March day, he comes across a flower in\nbloom, a jonquil:\n\u201cIt was the strongest expression of desire: it was the first\nperfume of the year. I felt all the happiness destined for man.\nThis unutterable harmony of souls, the phantom of the ideal world,\narose in me complete. I never felt anything so great or so\ninstantaneous. I know not what shape, what analogy, what secret of\nrelation it was that made me see in this flower a limitless\nbeauty.... I shall never inclose in a conception this power, this\nimmensity that nothing will express; this form that nothing will\ncontain; this ideal of a better world which one feels, but which,\nit seems, nature has not made actual.\u201d(319)\nWe heard in previous lectures of the vivified face of the world as it may\nappear to converts after their awakening.(320) As a rule, religious\npersons generally assume that whatever natural facts connect themselves in\nany way with their destiny are significant of the divine purposes with\nthem. Through prayer the purpose, often far from obvious, comes home to\nthem, and if it be \u201ctrial,\u201d strength to endure the trial is given. Thus at\nall stages of the prayerful life we find the persuasion that in the\nprocess of communion energy from on high flows in to meet demand, and\nbecomes operative within the phenomenal world. So long as this\noperativeness is admitted to be real, it makes no essential difference\nwhether its immediate effects be subjective or objective. The fundamental\nreligious point is that in prayer, spiritual energy, which otherwise would\nslumber, does become active, and spiritual work of some kind is effected\nreally.\nSo much for Prayer, taken in the wide sense of any kind of communion. As\nthe core of religion, we must return to it in the next lecture.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe last aspect of the religious life which remains for me to touch upon\nis the fact that its manifestations so frequently connect themselves with\nthe subconscious part of our existence. You may remember what I said in my\nopening lecture(321) about the prevalence of the psychopathic temperament\nin religious biography. You will in point of fact hardly find a religious\nleader of any kind in whose life there is no record of automatisms. I\nspeak not merely of savage priests and prophets, whose followers regard\nautomatic utterance and action as by itself tantamount to inspiration, I\nspeak of leaders of thought and subjects of intellectualized experience.\nSaint Paul had his visions, his ecstasies, his gift of tongues, small as\nwas the importance he attached to the latter. The whole array of Christian\nsaints and heresiarchs, including the greatest, the Bernards, the Loyolas,\nthe Luthers, the Foxes, the Wesleys, had their visions, voices, rapt\nconditions, guiding impressions, and \u201copenings.\u201d They had these things,\nbecause they had exalted sensibility, and to such things persons of\nexalted sensibility are liable. In such liability there lie, however,\nconsequences for theology. Beliefs are strengthened wherever automatisms\ncorroborate them. Incursions from beyond the transmarginal region have a\npeculiar power to increase conviction. The inchoate sense of presence is\ninfinitely stronger than conception, but strong as it may be, it is seldom\nequal to the evidence of hallucination. Saints who actually see or hear\ntheir Saviour reach the acme of assurance. Motor automatisms, though\nrarer, are, if possible, even more convincing than sensations. The\nsubjects here actually feel themselves played upon by powers beyond their\nwill. The evidence is dynamic; the God or spirit moves the very organs of\ntheir body.(322)\nThe great field for this sense of being the instrument of a higher power\nis of course \u201cinspiration.\u201d It is easy to discriminate between the\nreligious leaders who have been habitually subject to inspiration and\nthose who have not. In the teachings of the Buddha, of Jesus, of Saint\nPaul (apart from his gift of tongues), of Saint Augustine, of Huss, of\nLuther, of Wesley, automatic or semi\u2010automatic composition appears to have\nbeen only occasional. In the Hebrew prophets, on the contrary, in\nMohammed, in some of the Alexandrians, in many minor Catholic saints, in\nFox, in Joseph Smith, something like it appears to have been frequent,\nsometimes habitual. We have distinct professions of being under the\ndirection of a foreign power, and serving as its mouthpiece. As regards\nthe Hebrew prophets, it is extraordinary, writes an author who has made a\ncareful study of them, to see\u2014\n\u201cHow, one after another, the same features are reproduced in the\nprophetic books. The process is always extremely different from\nwhat it would be if the prophet arrived at his insight into\nspiritual things by the tentative efforts of his own genius. There\nis something sharp and sudden about it. He can lay his finger, so\nto speak, on the moment when it came. And it always comes in the\nform of an overpowering force from without, against which he\nstruggles, but in vain. Listen, for instance, [to] the opening of\nthe book of Jeremiah. Read through in like manner the first two\nchapters of the prophecy of Ezekiel.\n\u201cIt is not, however, only at the beginning of his career that the\nprophet passes through a crisis which is clearly not self\u2010caused.\nScattered all through the prophetic writings are expressions which\nspeak of some strong and irresistible impulse coming down upon the\nprophet, determining his attitude to the events of his time,\nconstraining his utterance, making his words the vehicle of a\nhigher meaning than their own. For instance, this of Isaiah\u2019s:\n\u2018The Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand,\u2019\u2014an emphatic phrase\nwhich denotes the overmastering nature of the impulse,\u2014\u2018and\ninstructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people.\u2019\n... Or passages like this from Ezekiel: \u2018The hand of the Lord God\nfell upon me,\u2019 \u2018The hand of the Lord was strong upon me.\u2019 The one\nstanding characteristic of the prophet is that he speaks with the\nauthority of Jehovah himself. Hence it is that the prophets one\nand all preface their addresses so confidently, \u2018The Word of the\nLord,\u2019 or \u2018Thus saith the Lord.\u2019 They have even the audacity to\nspeak in the first person, as if Jehovah himself were speaking. As\nin Isaiah: \u2018Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called; I am\nHe, I am the First, I also am the last,\u2019\u2014and so on. The\npersonality of the prophet sinks entirely into the background; he\nfeels himself for the time being the mouthpiece of the\nAlmighty.\u201d(323)\n\u201cWe need to remember that prophecy was a profession, and that the\nprophets formed a professional class. There were schools of the\nprophets, in which the gift was regularly cultivated. A group of\nyoung men would gather round some commanding figure\u2014a Samuel or an\nElisha\u2014and would not only record or spread the knowledge of his\nsayings and doings, but seek to catch themselves something of his\ninspiration. It seems that music played its part in their\nexercises.... It is perfectly clear that by no means all of these\nSons of the prophets ever succeeded in acquiring more than a very\nsmall share in the gift which they sought. It was clearly possible\nto \u2018counterfeit\u2019 prophecy. Sometimes this was done\ndeliberately.... But it by no means follows that in all cases\nwhere a false message was given, the giver of it was altogether\nconscious of what he was doing.\u201d(324)\nHere, to take another Jewish case, is the way in which Philo of Alexandria\ndescribes his inspiration:\u2014\n\u201cSometimes, when I have come to my work empty, I have suddenly\nbecome full; ideas being in an invisible manner showered upon me,\nand implanted in me from on high; so that through the influence of\ndivine inspiration, I have become greatly excited, and have known\nneither the place in which I was, nor those who were present, nor\nmyself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was writing; for then I\nhave been conscious of a richness of interpretation, an enjoyment\nof light, a most penetrating insight, a most manifest energy in\nall that was to be done; having such effect on my mind as the\nclearest ocular demonstration would have on the eyes.\u201d(325)\nIf we turn to Islam, we find that Mohammed\u2019s revelations all came from the\nsubconscious sphere. To the question in what way he got them,\u2014\n\u201cMohammed is said to have answered that sometimes he heard a knell\nas from a bell, and that this had the strongest effect on him; and\nwhen the angel went away, he had received the revelation.\nSometimes again he held converse with the angel as with a man, so\nas easily to understand his words. The later authorities, however,\n... distinguish still other kinds. In the Itg\u00e2n (103) the\nfollowing are enumerated: 1, revelations with sound of bell, 2, by\ninspiration of the holy spirit in M.\u2019s heart, 3, by Gabriel in\nhuman form, 4, by God immediately, either when awake (as in his\njourney to heaven) or in dream.... In Almaw\u00e2hib alladun\u00eeya the\nkinds are thus given: 1, Dream, 2, Inspiration of Gabriel in the\nProphet\u2019s heart, 3, Gabriel taking Dahya\u2019s form, 4, with the bell\u2010\nsound, etc., 5, Gabriel in propri\u00e2 person\u00e2 (only twice), 6,\nrevelation in heaven, 7, God appearing in person, but veiled, 8,\nGod revealing himself immediately without veil. Others add two\nother stages, namely: 1, Gabriel in the form of still another man,\n2, God showing himself personally in dream.\u201d(326)\nIn none of these cases is the revelation distinctly motor. In the case of\nJoseph Smith (who had prophetic revelations innumerable in addition to the\nrevealed translation of the gold plates which resulted in the Book of\nMormon), although there may have been a motor element, the inspiration\nseems to have been predominantly sensorial. He began his translation by\nthe aid of the \u201cpeep\u2010stones\u201d which he found, or thought or said that he\nfound, with the gold plates,\u2014apparently a case of \u201ccrystal gazing.\u201d For\nsome of the other revelations he used the peep\u2010stones, but seems generally\nto have asked the Lord for more direct instruction.(327)\nOther revelations are described as \u201copenings\u201d\u2014Fox\u2019s, for example, were\nevidently of the kind known in spiritistic circles of to\u2010day as\n\u201cimpressions.\u201d As all effective initiators of change must needs live to\nsome degree upon this psychopathic level of sudden perception or\nconviction of new truth, or of impulse to action so obsessive that it must\nbe worked off, I will say nothing more about so very common a phenomenon.\nWhen, in addition to these phenomena of inspiration, we take religious\nmysticism into the account, when we recall the striking and sudden\nunifications of a discordant self which we saw in conversion, and when we\nreview the extravagant obsessions of tenderness, purity, and self\u2010severity\nmet with in saintliness, we cannot, I think, avoid the conclusion that in\nreligion we have a department of human nature with unusually close\nrelations to the trans\u2010marginal or subliminal region. If the word\n\u201csubliminal\u201d is offensive to any of you, as smelling too much of psychical\nresearch or other aberrations, call it by any other name you please, to\ndistinguish it from the level of full sunlit consciousness. Call this\nlatter the A\u2010region of personality, if you care to, and call the other the\nB\u2010region. The B\u2010region, then, is obviously the larger part of each of us,\nfor it is the abode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of\neverything that passes unrecorded or unobserved. It contains, for example,\nsuch things as all our momentarily inactive memories, and it harbors the\nsprings of all our obscurely motived passions, impulses, likes, dislikes,\nand prejudices. Our intuitions, hypotheses, fancies, superstitions,\npersuasions, convictions, and in general all our non\u2010rational operations,\ncome from it. It is the source of our dreams, and apparently they may\nreturn to it. In it arise whatever mystical experiences we may have, and\nour automatisms, sensory or motor; our life in hypnotic and \u201chypnoid\u201d\nconditions, if we are subjects to such conditions; our delusions, fixed\nideas, and hysterical accidents, if we are hysteric subjects; our supra\u2010\nnormal cognitions, if such there be, and if we are telepathic subjects. It\nis also the fountain\u2010head of much that feeds our religion. In persons deep\nin the religious life, as we have now abundantly seen,\u2014and this is my\nconclusion,\u2014the door into this region seems unusually wide open; at any\nrate, experiences making their entrance through that door have had\nemphatic influence in shaping religious history.\nWith this conclusion I turn back and close the circle which I opened in my\nfirst lecture, terminating thus the review which I then announced of inner\nreligious phenomena as we find them in developed and articulate human\nindividuals. I might easily, if the time allowed, multiply both my\ndocuments and my discriminations, but a broad treatment is, I believe, in\nitself better, and the most important characteristics of the subject lie,\nI think, before us already. In the next lecture, which is also the last\none, we must try to draw the critical conclusions which so much material\nmay suggest.\nLECTURE XX. CONCLUSIONS.\nThe material of our study of human nature is now spread before us; and in\nthis parting hour, set free from the duty of description, we can draw our\ntheoretical and practical conclusions. In my first lecture, defending the\nempirical method, I foretold that whatever conclusions we might come to\ncould be reached by spiritual judgments only, appreciations of the\nsignificance for life of religion, taken \u201con the whole.\u201d Our conclusions\ncannot be as sharp as dogmatic conclusions would be, but I will formulate\nthem, when the time comes, as sharply as I can.\nSumming up in the broadest possible way the characteristics of the\nreligious life, as we have found them, it includes the following beliefs:\u2014\n1. That the visible world is part of a more spiritual universe from which\nit draws its chief significance;\n2. That union or harmonious relation with that higher universe is our true\nend;\n3. That prayer or inner communion with the spirit thereof\u2014be that spirit\n\u201cGod\u201d or \u201claw\u201d\u2014is a process wherein work is really done, and spiritual\nenergy flows in and produces effects, psychological or material, within\nthe phenomenal world.\nReligion includes also the following psychological characteristics:\u2014\n4. A new zest which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form\neither of lyrical enchantment or of appeal to earnestness and heroism.\n5. An assurance of safety and a temper of peace, and, in relation to\nothers, a preponderance of loving affections.\nIn illustrating these characteristics by documents, we have been literally\nbathed in sentiment. In re\u2010reading my manuscript, I am almost appalled at\nthe amount of emotionality which I find in it. After so much of this, we\ncan afford to be dryer and less sympathetic in the rest of the work that\nlies before us.\nThe sentimentality of many of my documents is a consequence of the fact\nthat I sought them among the extravagances of the subject. If any of you\nare enemies of what our ancestors used to brand as enthusiasm, and are,\nnevertheless, still listening to me now, you have probably felt my\nselection to have been sometimes almost perverse, and have wished I might\nhave stuck to soberer examples. I reply that I took these extremer\nexamples as yielding the profounder information. To learn the secrets of\nany science, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be\neccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils. We combine what they\ntell us with the rest of our wisdom, and form our final judgment\nindependently. Even so with religion. We who have pursued such radical\nexpressions of it may now be sure that we know its secrets as\nauthentically as any one can know them who learns them from another; and\nwe have next to answer, each of us for himself, the practical question:\nwhat are the dangers in this element of life? and in what proportion may\nit need to be restrained by other elements, to give the proper balance?\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut this question suggests another one which I will answer immediately and\nget it out of the way, for it has more than once already vexed us.(328)\nOught it to be assumed that in all men the mixture of religion with other\nelements should be identical? Ought it, indeed, to be assumed that the\nlives of all men should show identical religious elements? In other words,\nis the existence of so many religious types and sects and creeds\nregrettable?\nTo these questions I answer \u201cNo\u201d emphatically. And my reason is that I do\nnot see how it is possible that creatures in such different positions and\nwith such different powers as human individuals are, should have exactly\nthe same functions and the same duties. No two of us have identical\ndifficulties, nor should we be expected to work out identical solutions.\nEach, from his peculiar angle of observation, takes in a certain sphere of\nfact and trouble, which each must deal with in a unique manner. One of us\nmust soften himself, another must harden himself; one must yield a point,\nanother must stand firm,\u2014in order the better to defend the position\nassigned him. If an Emerson were forced to be a Wesley, or a Moody forced\nto be a Whitman, the total human consciousness of the divine would suffer.\nThe divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities,\nby being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find\nworthy missions. Each attitude being a syllable in human nature\u2019s total\nmessage, it takes the whole of us to spell the meaning out completely. So\na \u201cgod of battles\u201d must be allowed to be the god for one kind of person, a\ngod of peace and heaven and home, the god for another. We must frankly\nrecognize the fact that we live in partial systems, and that parts are not\ninterchangeable in the spiritual life. If we are peevish and jealous,\ndestruction of the self must be an element of our religion; why need it be\none if we are good and sympathetic from the outset? If we are sick souls,\nwe require a religion of deliverance; but why think so much of\ndeliverance, if we are healthy\u2010minded?(329) Unquestionably, some men have\nthe completer experience and the higher vocation, here just as in the\nsocial world; but for each man to stay in his own experience, whate\u2019er it\nbe, and for others to tolerate him there, is surely best.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut, you may now ask, would not this one\u2010sidedness be cured if we should\nall espouse the science of religions as our own religion? In answering\nthis question I must open again the general relations of the theoretic to\nthe active life.\nKnowledge about a thing is not the thing itself. You remember what Al\u2010\nGhazzali told us in the Lecture on Mysticism,\u2014that to understand the\ncauses of drunkenness, as a physician understands them, is not to be\ndrunk. A science might come to understand everything about the causes and\nelements of religion, and might even decide which elements were qualified,\nby their general harmony with other branches of knowledge, to be\nconsidered true; and yet the best man at this science might be the man who\nfound it hardest to be personally devout. _Tout savoir c\u2019est tout\npardonner._ The name of Renan would doubtless occur to many persons as an\nexample of the way in which breadth of knowledge may make one only a\ndilettante in possibilities, and blunt the acuteness of one\u2019s living\nfaith.(330) If religion be a function by which either God\u2019s cause or man\u2019s\ncause is to be really advanced, then he who lives the life of it, however\nnarrowly, is a better servant than he who merely knows about it, however\nmuch. Knowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation of a place\nin life, with its dynamic currents passing through your being, is another.\nFor this reason, the science of religions may not be an equivalent for\nliving religion; and if we turn to the inner difficulties of such a\nscience, we see that a point comes when she must drop the purely theoretic\nattitude, and either let her knots remain uncut, or have them cut by\nactive faith. To see this, suppose that we have our science of religions\nconstituted as a matter of fact. Suppose that she has assimilated all the\nnecessary historical material and distilled out of it as its essence the\nsame conclusions which I myself a few moments ago pronounced. Suppose that\nshe agrees that religion, wherever it is an active thing, involves a\nbelief in ideal presences, and a belief that in our prayerful communion\nwith them,(331) work is done, and something real comes to pass. She has\nnow to exert her critical activity, and to decide how far, in the light of\nother sciences and in that of general philosophy, such beliefs can be\nconsidered _true_.\nDogmatically to decide this is an impossible task. Not only are the other\nsciences and the philosophy still far from being completed, but in their\npresent state we find them full of conflicts. The sciences of nature know\nnothing of spiritual presences, and on the whole hold no practical\ncommerce whatever with the idealistic conceptions towards which general\nphilosophy inclines. The scientist, so\u2010called, is, during his scientific\nhours at least, so materialistic that one may well say that on the whole\nthe influence of science goes against the notion that religion should be\nrecognized at all. And this antipathy to religion finds an echo within the\nvery science of religions itself. The cultivator of this science has to\nbecome acquainted with so many groveling and horrible superstitions that a\npresumption easily arises in his mind that any belief that is religious\nprobably is false. In the \u201cprayerful communion\u201d of savages with such\nmumbo\u2010jumbos of deities as they acknowledge, it is hard for us to see what\ngenuine spiritual work\u2014even though it were work relative only to their\ndark savage obligations\u2014can possibly be done.\nThe consequence is that the conclusions of the science of religions are as\nlikely to be adverse as they are to be favorable to the claim that the\nessence of religion is true. There is a notion in the air about us that\nreligion is probably only an anachronism, a case of \u201csurvival,\u201d an\natavistic relapse into a mode of thought which humanity in its more\nenlightened examples has outgrown; and this notion our religious\nanthropologists at present do little to counteract.\nThis view is so widespread at the present day that I must consider it with\nsome explicitness before I pass to my own conclusions. Let me call it the\n\u201cSurvival theory,\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake.\nThe pivot round which the religious life, as we have traced it, revolves,\nis the interest of the individual in his private personal destiny.\nReligion, in short, is a monumental chapter in the history of human\negotism. The gods believed in\u2014whether by crude savages or by men\ndisciplined intellectually\u2014agree with each other in recognizing personal\ncalls. Religious thought is carried on in terms of personality, this\nbeing, in the world of religion, the one fundamental fact. To\u2010day, quite\nas much as at any previous age, the religious individual tells you that\nthe divine meets him on the basis of his personal concerns.\nScience, on the other hand, has ended by utterly repudiating the personal\npoint of view. She catalogues her elements and records her laws\nindifferent as to what purpose may be shown forth by them, and constructs\nher theories quite careless of their bearing on human anxieties and fates.\nThough the scientist may individually nourish a religion, and be a theist\nin his irresponsible hours, the days are over when it could be said that\nfor Science herself the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament\nshoweth his handiwork. Our solar system, with its harmonies, is seen now\nas but one passing case of a certain sort of moving equilibrium in the\nheavens, realized by a local accident in an appalling wilderness of worlds\nwhere no life can exist. In a span of time which as a cosmic interval will\ncount but as an hour, it will have ceased to be. The Darwinian notion of\nchance production, and subsequent destruction, speedy or deferred, applies\nto the largest as well as to the smallest facts. It is impossible, in the\npresent temper of the scientific imagination, to find in the driftings of\nthe cosmic atoms, whether they work on the universal or on the particular\nscale, anything but a kind of aimless weather, doing and undoing,\nachieving no proper history, and leaving no result. Nature has no one\ndistinguishable ultimate tendency with which it is possible to feel a\nsympathy. In the vast rhythm of her processes, as the scientific mind now\nfollows them, she appears to cancel herself. The books of natural theology\nwhich satisfied the intellects of our grandfathers seem to us quite\ngrotesque,(332) representing, as they did, a God who conformed the largest\nthings of nature to the paltriest of our private wants. The God whom\nscience recognizes must be a God of universal laws exclusively, a God who\ndoes a wholesale, not a retail business. He cannot accommodate his\nprocesses to the convenience of individuals. The bubbles on the foam which\ncoats a stormy sea are floating episodes, made and unmade by the forces of\nthe wind and water. Our private selves are like those\nbubbles,\u2014epiphenomena, as Clifford, I believe, ingeniously called them;\ntheir destinies weigh nothing and determine nothing in the world\u2019s\nirremediable currents of events.\nYou see how natural it is, from this point of view, to treat religion as a\nmere survival, for religion does in fact perpetuate the traditions of the\nmost primeval thought. To coerce the spiritual powers, or to square them\nand get them on our side, was, during enormous tracts of time, the one\ngreat object in our dealings with the natural world. For our ancestors,\ndreams, hallucinations, revelations, and cock\u2010and\u2010bull stories were\ninextricably mixed with facts. Up to a comparatively recent date such\ndistinctions as those between what has been verified and what is only\nconjectured, between the impersonal and the personal aspects of existence,\nwere hardly suspected or conceived. Whatever you imagined in a lively\nmanner, whatever you thought fit to be true, you affirmed confidently; and\nwhatever you affirmed, your comrades believed. Truth was what had not yet\nbeen contradicted, most things were taken into the mind from the point of\nview of their human suggestiveness, and the attention confined itself\nexclusively to the \u00e6sthetic and dramatic aspects of events.(333)\nHow indeed could it be otherwise? The extraordinary value, for explanation\nand prevision, of those mathematical and mechanical modes of conception\nwhich science uses, was a result that could not possibly have been\nexpected in advance. Weight, movement, velocity, direction, position, what\nthin, pallid, uninteresting ideas! How could the richer animistic aspects\nof Nature, the peculiarities and oddities that make phenomena\npicturesquely striking or expressive, fail to have been first singled out\nand followed by philosophy as the more promising avenue to the knowledge\nof Nature\u2019s life? Well, it is still in these richer animistic and dramatic\naspects that religion delights to dwell. It is the terror and beauty of\nphenomena, the \u201cpromise\u201d of the dawn and of the rainbow, the \u201cvoice\u201d of\nthe thunder, the \u201cgentleness\u201d of the summer rain, the \u201csublimity\u201d of the\nstars, and not the physical laws which these things follow, by which the\nreligious mind still continues to be most impressed; and just as of yore,\nthe devout man tells you that in the solitude of his room or of the fields\nhe still feels the divine presence, that inflowings of help come in reply\nto his prayers, and that sacrifices to this unseen reality fill him with\nsecurity and peace.\nPure anachronism! says the survival\u2010theory;\u2014anachronism for which\ndeanthropomorphization of the imagination is the remedy required. The less\nwe mix the private with the cosmic, the more we dwell in universal and\nimpersonal terms, the truer heirs of Science we become.\nIn spite of the appeal which this impersonality of the scientific attitude\nmakes to a certain magnanimity of temper, I believe it to be shallow, and\nI can now state my reason in comparatively few words. That reason is that,\nso long as we deal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only with the\nsymbols of reality, but _as soon as we deal with private and personal\nphenomena as such, we deal with realities in the completest sense of the\nterm_. I think I can easily make clear what I mean by these words.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe world of our experience consists at all times of two parts, an\nobjective and a subjective part, of which the former may be incalculably\nmore extensive than the latter, and yet the latter can never be omitted or\nsuppressed. The objective part is the sum total of whatsoever at any given\ntime we may be thinking of, the subjective part is the inner \u201cstate\u201d in\nwhich the thinking comes to pass. What we think of may be enormous,\u2014the\ncosmic times and spaces, for example,\u2014whereas the inner state may be the\nmost fugitive and paltry activity of mind. Yet the cosmic objects, so far\nas the experience yields them, are but ideal pictures of something whose\nexistence we do not inwardly possess but only point at outwardly, while\nthe inner state is our very experience itself; its reality and that of our\nexperience are one. A conscious field _plus_ its object as felt or thought\nof _plus_ an attitude towards the object _plus_ the sense of a self to\nwhom the attitude belongs\u2014such a concrete bit of personal experience may\nbe a small bit, but it is a solid bit as long as it lasts; not hollow, not\na mere abstract element of experience, such as the \u201cobject\u201d is when taken\nall alone. It is a _full_ fact, even though it be an insignificant fact;\nit is of the _kind_ to which all realities whatsoever must belong; the\nmotor currents of the world run through the like of it; it is on the line\nconnecting real events with real events. That unsharable feeling which\neach one of us has of the pinch of his individual destiny as he privately\nfeels it rolling out on fortune\u2019s wheel may be disparaged for its egotism,\nmay be sneered at as unscientific, but it is the one thing that fills up\nthe measure of our concrete actuality, and any would\u2010be existent that\nshould lack such a feeling, or its analogue, would be a piece of reality\nonly half made up.(334)\nIf this be true, it is absurd for science to say that the egotistic\nelements of experience should be suppressed. The axis of reality runs\nsolely through the egotistic places,\u2014they are strung upon it like so many\nbeads. To describe the world with all the various feelings of the\nindividual pinch of destiny, all the various spiritual attitudes, left out\nfrom the description\u2014they being as describable as anything else\u2014would be\nsomething like offering a printed bill of fare as the equivalent for a\nsolid meal. Religion makes no such blunder. The individual\u2019s religion may\nbe egotistic, and those private realities which it keeps in touch with may\nbe narrow enough; but at any rate it always remains infinitely less hollow\nand abstract, as far as it goes, than a science which prides itself on\ntaking no account of anything private at all.\nA bill of fare with one real raisin on it instead of the word \u201craisin,\u201d\nwith one real egg instead of the word \u201cegg,\u201d might be an inadequate meal,\nbut it would at least be a commencement of reality. The contention of the\nsurvival\u2010theory that we ought to stick to non\u2010personal elements\nexclusively seems like saying that we ought to be satisfied forever with\nreading the naked bill of fare. I think, therefore, that however\nparticular questions connected with our individual destinies may be\nanswered, it is only by acknowledging them as genuine questions, and\nliving in the sphere of thought which they open up, that we become\nprofound. But to live thus is to be religious; so I unhesitatingly\nrepudiate the survival\u2010theory of religion, as being founded on an\negregious mistake. It does not follow, because our ancestors made so many\nerrors of fact and mixed them with their religion, that we should\ntherefore leave off being religious at all.(335) By being religious we\nestablish ourselves in possession of ultimate reality at the only points\nat which reality is given us to guard. Our responsible concern is with our\nprivate destiny, after all.\nYou see now why I have been so individualistic throughout these lectures,\nand why I have seemed so bent on rehabilitating the element of feeling in\nreligion and subordinating its intellectual part. Individuality is founded\nin feeling; and the recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder strata of\ncharacter, are the only places in the world in which we catch real fact in\nthe making, and directly perceive how events happen, and how work is\nactually done.(336) Compared with this world of living individualized\nfeelings, the world of generalized objects which the intellect\ncontemplates is without solidity or life. As in stereoscopic or\nkinetoscopic pictures seen outside the instrument, the third dimension,\nthe movement, the vital element, are not there. We get a beautiful picture\nof an express train supposed to be moving, but where in the picture, as I\nhave heard a friend say, is the energy or the fifty miles an hour?(337)\nLet us agree, then, that Religion, occupying herself with personal\ndestinies and keeping thus in contact with the only absolute realities\nwhich we know, must necessarily play an eternal part in human history. The\nnext thing to decide is what she reveals about those destinies, or whether\nindeed she reveals anything distinct enough to be considered a general\nmessage to mankind. We have done as you see, with our preliminaries, and\nour final summing up can now begin.\nI am well aware that after all the palpitating documents which I have\nquoted, and all the perspectives of emotion\u2010inspiring institution and\nbelief that my previous lectures have opened, the dry analysis to which I\nnow advance may appear to many of you like an anti\u2010climax, a tapering\u2010off\nand flattening out of the subject, instead of a crescendo of interest and\nresult. I said awhile ago that the religious attitude of Protestants\nappears poverty\u2010stricken to the Catholic imagination. Still more poverty\u2010\nstricken, I fear, may my final summing up of the subject appear at first\nto some of you. On which account I pray you now to bear this point in\nmind, that in the present part of it I am expressly trying to reduce\nreligion to its lowest admissible terms, to that minimum, free from\nindividualistic excrescences, which all religions contain as their\nnucleus, and on which it may be hoped that all religious persons may\nagree. That established, we should have a result which might be small, but\nwould at least be solid; and on it and round it the ruddier additional\nbeliefs on which the different individuals make their venture might be\ngrafted, and flourish as richly as you please. I shall add my own over\u2010\nbelief (which will be, I confess, of a somewhat pallid kind, as befits a\ncritical philosopher), and you will, I hope, also add your over\u2010beliefs,\nand we shall soon be in the varied world of concrete religious\nconstructions once more. For the moment, let me dryly pursue the analytic\npart of the task.\nBoth thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct\nmay be determined either by feeling or by thought. When we survey the\nwhole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have\nprevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the\nother are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian, and Buddhist\nsaints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The theories\nwhich Religion generates, being thus variable, are secondary; and if you\nwish to grasp her essence, you must look to the feelings and the conduct\nas being the more constant elements. It is between these two elements that\nthe short circuit exists on which she carries on her principal business,\nwhile the ideas and symbols and other institutions form loop\u2010lines which\nmay be perfections and improvements, and may even some day all be united\ninto one harmonious system, but which are not to be regarded as organs\nwith an indispensable function, necessary at all times for religious life\nto go on. This seems to me the first conclusion which we are entitled to\ndraw from the phenomena we have passed in review.\nThe next step is to characterize the feelings. To what psychological order\ndo they belong?\nThe resultant outcome of them is in any case what Kant calls a \u201csthenic\u201d\naffection, an excitement of the cheerful, expansive, \u201cdynamogenic\u201d order\nwhich, like any tonic, freshens our vital powers. In almost every lecture,\nbut especially in the lectures on Conversion and on Saintliness, we have\nseen how this emotion overcomes temperamental melancholy and imparts\nendurance to the Subject, or a zest, or a meaning, or an enchantment and\nglory to the common objects of life.(338) The name of \u201cfaith\u2010state,\u201d by\nwhich Professor Leuba designates it, is a good one.(339) It is a\nbiological as well as a psychological condition, and Tolstoy is absolutely\naccurate in classing faith among the forces _by which men live_.(340) The\ntotal absence of it, anhedonia,(341) means collapse.\nThe faith\u2010state may hold a very minimum of intellectual content. We saw\nexamples of this in those sudden raptures of the divine presence, or in\nsuch mystical seizures as Dr. Bucke described.(342) It may be a mere vague\nenthusiasm, half spiritual, half vital, a courage, and a feeling that\ngreat and wondrous things are in the air.(343)\nWhen, however, a positive intellectual content is associated with a faith\u2010\nstate, it gets invincibly stamped in upon belief,(344) and this explains\nthe passionate loyalty of religious persons everywhere to the minutest\ndetails of their so widely differing creeds. Taking creeds and faith\u2010state\ntogether, as forming \u201creligions,\u201d and treating these as purely subjective\nphenomena, without regard to the question of their \u201ctruth,\u201d we are\nobliged, on account of their extraordinary influence upon action and\nendurance, to class them amongst the most important biological functions\nof mankind. Their stimulant and an\u00e6sthetic effect is so great that\nProfessor Leuba, in a recent article,(345) goes so far as to say that so\nlong as men can _use_ their God, they care very little who he is, or even\nwhether he is at all. \u201cThe truth of the matter can be put,\u201d says Leuba,\n\u201cin this way: _God is not known, he is not understood; he is\nused_\u2014sometimes as meat\u2010purveyor, sometimes as moral support, sometimes as\nfriend, sometimes as an object of love. If he proves himself useful, the\nreligious consciousness asks for no more than that. Does God really exist?\nHow does he exist? What is he? are so many irrelevant questions. Not God,\nbut life, more life, a larger, richer, more satisfying life, is, in the\nlast analysis, the end of religion. The love of life, at any and every\nlevel of development, is the religious impulse.\u201d(346)\nAt this purely subjective rating, therefore, Religion must be considered\nvindicated in a certain way from the attacks of her critics. It would seem\nthat she cannot be a mere anachronism and survival, but must exert a\npermanent function, whether she be with or without intellectual content,\nand whether, if she have any, it be true or false.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWe must next pass beyond the point of view of merely subjective utility,\nand make inquiry into the intellectual content itself.\nFirst, is there, under all the discrepancies of the creeds, a common\nnucleus to which they bear their testimony unanimously?\nAnd second, ought we to consider the testimony true?\nI will take up the first question first, and answer it immediately in the\naffirmative. The warring gods and formulas of the various religions do\nindeed cancel each other, but there is a certain uniform deliverance in\nwhich religions all appear to meet. It consists of two parts:\u2014\n1. An uneasiness; and\n2. Its solution.\n1. The uneasiness, reduced to its simplest terms, is a sense that there is\n_something wrong about us_ as we naturally stand.\n2. The solution is a sense that _we are saved from the wrongness_ by\nmaking proper connection with the higher powers.\nIn those more developed minds which alone we are studying, the wrongness\ntakes a moral character, and the salvation takes a mystical tinge. I think\nwe shall keep well within the limits of what is common to all such minds\nif we formulate the essence of their religious experience in terms like\nthese:\u2014\nThe individual, so far as he suffers from his wrongness and criticises it,\nis to that extent consciously beyond it, and in at least possible touch\nwith something higher, if anything higher exist. Along with the wrong part\nthere is thus a better part of him, even though it may be but a most\nhelpless germ. With which part he should identify his real being is by no\nmeans obvious at this stage; but when stage 2 (the stage of solution or\nsalvation) arrives,(347) the man identifies his real being with the\ngerminal higher part of himself; and does so in the following way. _He\nbecomes conscious that this higher part is conterminous and continuous\nwith a _MORE_ of the same quality, which is operative in the universe\noutside of him, and which he can keep in working touch with, and in a\nfashion get on board of and save himself when all his lower being has gone\nto pieces in the wreck._\nIt seems to me that all the phenomena are accurately describable in these\nvery simple general terms.(348) They allow for the divided self and the\nstruggle; they involve the change of personal centre and the surrender of\nthe lower self; they express the appearance of exteriority of the helping\npower and yet account for our sense of union with it;(349) and they fully\njustify our feelings of security and joy. There is probably no\nautobiographic document, among all those which I have quoted, to which the\ndescription will not well apply. One need only add such specific details\nas will adapt it to various theologies and various personal temperaments,\nand one will then have the various experiences reconstructed in their\nindividual forms.\nSo far, however, as this analysis goes, the experiences are only\npsychological phenomena. They possess, it is true, enormous biological\nworth. Spiritual strength really increases in the subject when he has\nthem, a new life opens for him, and they seem to him a place of conflux\nwhere the forces of two universes meet; and yet this may be nothing but\nhis subjective way of feeling things, a mood of his own fancy, in spite of\nthe effects produced. I now turn to my second question: What is the\nobjective \u201ctruth\u201d of their content?(350)\nThe part of the content concerning which the question of truth most\npertinently arises is that \u201cMORE of the same quality\u201d with which our own\nhigher self appears in the experience to come into harmonious working\nrelation. Is such a \u201cmore\u201d merely our own notion, or does it really exist?\nIf so, in what shape does it exist? Does it act, as well as exist? And in\nwhat form should we conceive of that \u201cunion\u201d with it of which religious\ngeniuses are so convinced?\nIt is in answering these questions that the various theologies perform\ntheir theoretic work, and that their divergencies most come to light. They\nall agree that the \u201cmore\u201d really exists; though some of them hold it to\nexist in the shape of a personal god or gods, while others are satisfied\nto conceive it as a stream of ideal tendency embedded in the eternal\nstructure of the world. They all agree, moreover, that it acts as well as\nexists, and that something really is effected for the better when you\nthrow your life into its hands. It is when they treat of the experience of\n\u201cunion\u201d with it that their speculative differences appear most clearly.\nOver this point pantheism and theism, nature and second birth, works and\ngrace and karma, immortality and reincarnation, rationalism and mysticism,\ncarry on inveterate disputes.\nAt the end of my lecture on Philosophy(351) I held out the notion that an\nimpartial science of religions might sift out from the midst of their\ndiscrepancies a common body of doctrine which she might also formulate in\nterms to which physical science need not object. This, I said, she might\nadopt as her own reconciling hypothesis, and recommend it for general\nbelief. I also said that in my last lecture I should have to try my own\nhand at framing such an hypothesis.\nThe time has now come for this attempt. Who says \u201chypothesis\u201d renounces\nthe ambition to be coercive in his arguments. The most I can do is,\naccordingly, to offer something that may fit the facts so easily that your\nscientific logic will find no plausible pretext for vetoing your impulse\nto welcome it as true.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe \u201cmore,\u201d as we called it, and the meaning of our \u201cunion\u201d with it, form\nthe nucleus of our inquiry. Into what definite description can these words\nbe translated, and for what definite facts do they stand? It would never\ndo for us to place ourselves offhand at the position of a particular\ntheology, the Christian theology, for example, and proceed immediately to\ndefine the \u201cmore\u201d as Jehovah, and the \u201cunion\u201d as his imputation to us of\nthe righteousness of Christ. That would be unfair to other religions, and,\nfrom our present standpoint at least, would be an over\u2010belief.\nWe must begin by using less particularized terms; and, since one of the\nduties of the science of religions is to keep religion in connection with\nthe rest of science, we shall do well to seek first of all a way of\ndescribing the \u201cmore,\u201d which psychologists may also recognize as real. The\n_subconscious self_ is nowadays a well\u2010accredited psychological entity;\nand I believe that in it we have exactly the mediating term required.\nApart from all religious considerations, there is actually and literally\nmore life in our total soul than we are at any time aware of. The\nexploration of the transmarginal field has hardly yet been seriously\nundertaken, but what Mr. Myers said in 1892 in his essay on the Subliminal\nConsciousness(352) is as true as when it was first written: \u201cEach of us is\nin reality an abiding psychical entity far more extensive than he knows\u2014an\nindividuality which can never express itself completely through any\ncorporeal manifestation. The Self manifests through the organism; but\nthere is always some part of the Self unmanifested; and always, as it\nseems, some power of organic expression in abeyance or reserve.\u201d(353) Much\nof the content of this larger background against which our conscious being\nstands out in relief is insignificant. Imperfect memories, silly jingles,\ninhibitive timidities, \u201cdissolutive\u201d phenomena of various sorts, as Myers\ncalls them, enter into it for a large part. But in it many of the\nperformances of genius seem also to have their origin; and in our study of\nconversion, of mystical experiences, and of prayer, we have seen how\nstriking a part invasions from this region play in the religious life.\nLet me then propose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it may be on its\n_farther_ side, the \u201cmore\u201d with which in religious experience we feel\nourselves connected is on its _hither_ side the subconscious continuation\nof our conscious life. Starting thus with a recognized psychological fact\nas our basis, we seem to preserve a contact with \u201cscience\u201d which the\nordinary theologian lacks. At the same time the theologian\u2019s contention\nthat the religious man is moved by an external power is vindicated, for it\nis one of the peculiarities of invasions from the subconscious region to\ntake on objective appearances, and to suggest to the Subject an external\ncontrol. In the religious life the control is felt as \u201chigher\u201d; but since\non our hypothesis it is primarily the higher faculties of our own hidden\nmind which are controlling, the sense of union with the power beyond us is\na sense of something, not merely apparently, but literally true.\nThis doorway into the subject seems to me the best one for a science of\nreligions, for it mediates between a number of different points of view.\nYet it is only a doorway, and difficulties present themselves as soon as\nwe step through it, and ask how far our transmarginal consciousness\ncarries us if we follow it on its remoter side. Here the over\u2010beliefs\nbegin: here mysticism and the conversion\u2010rapture and Vedantism and\ntranscendental idealism bring in their monistic interpretations(354) and\ntell us that the finite self rejoins the absolute self, for it was always\none with God and identical with the soul of the world.(355) Here the\nprophets of all the different religions come with their visions, voices,\nraptures, and other openings, supposed by each to authenticate his own\npeculiar faith.\nThose of us who are not personally favored with such specific revelations\nmust stand outside of them altogether and, for the present at least,\ndecide that, since they corroborate incompatible theological doctrines,\nthey neutralize one another and leave no fixed result. If we follow any\none of them, or if we follow philosophical theory and embrace monistic\npantheism on non\u2010mystical grounds, we do so in the exercise of our\nindividual freedom, and build out our religion in the way most congruous\nwith our personal susceptibilities. Among these susceptibilities\nintellectual ones play a decisive part. Although the religious question is\nprimarily a question of life, of living or not living in the higher union\nwhich opens itself to us as a gift, yet the spiritual excitement in which\nthe gift appears a real one will often fail to be aroused in an individual\nuntil certain particular intellectual beliefs or ideas which, as we say,\ncome home to him, are touched.(356) These ideas will thus be essential to\nthat individual\u2019s religion;\u2014which is as much as to say that over\u2010beliefs\nin various directions are absolutely indispensable, and that we should\ntreat them with tenderness and tolerance so long as they are not\nintolerant themselves. As I have elsewhere written, the most interesting\nand valuable things about a man are usually his over\u2010beliefs.\nDisregarding the over\u2010beliefs, and confining ourselves to what is common\nand generic, we have in _the fact that the conscious person is continuous\nwith a wider self through which saving experiences come_,(357) a positive\ncontent of religious experience which, it seems to me, _is literally and\nobjectively true as far as it goes_. If I now proceed to state my own\nhypothesis about the farther limits of this extension of our personality,\nI shall be offering my own over\u2010belief\u2014though I know it will appear a\nsorry under\u2010belief to some of you\u2014for which I can only bespeak the same\nindulgence which in a converse case I should accord to yours.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe further limits of our being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether\nother dimension of existence from the sensible and merely \u201cunderstandable\u201d\nworld. Name it the mystical region, or the supernatural region, whichever\nyou choose. So far as our ideal impulses originate in this region (and\nmost of them do originate in it, for we find them possessing us in a way\nfor which we cannot articulately account), we belong to it in a more\nintimate sense than that in which we belong to the visible world, for we\nbelong in the most intimate sense wherever our ideals belong. Yet the\nunseen region in question is not merely ideal, for it produces effects in\nthis world. When we commune with it, work is actually done upon our finite\npersonality, for we are turned into new men, and consequences in the way\nof conduct follow in the natural world upon our regenerative change.(358)\nBut that which produces effects within another reality must be termed a\nreality itself, so I feel as if we had no philosophic excuse for calling\nthe unseen or mystical world unreal.\nGod is the natural appellation, for us Christians at least, for the\nsupreme reality, so I will call this higher part of the universe by the\nname of God.(359) We and God have business with each other; and in opening\nourselves to his influence our deepest destiny is fulfilled. The universe,\nat those parts of it which our personal being constitutes, takes a turn\ngenuinely for the worse or for the better in proportion as each one of us\nfulfills or evades God\u2019s demands. As far as this goes I probably have you\nwith me, for I only translate into schematic language what I may call the\ninstinctive belief of mankind: God is real since he produces real effects.\nThe real effects in question, so far as I have as yet admitted them, are\nexerted on the personal centres of energy of the various subjects, but the\nspontaneous faith of most of the subjects is that they embrace a wider\nsphere than this. Most religious men believe (or \u201cknow,\u201d if they be\nmystical) that not only they themselves, but the whole universe of beings\nto whom the God is present, are secure in his parental hands. There is a\nsense, a dimension, they are sure, in which we are _all_ saved, in spite\nof the gates of hell and all adverse terrestrial appearances. God\u2019s\nexistence is the guarantee of an ideal order that shall be permanently\npreserved. This world may indeed, as science assures us, some day burn up\nor freeze; but if it is part of his order, the old ideals are sure to be\nbrought elsewhere to fruition, so that where God is, tragedy is only\nprovisional and partial, and shipwreck and dissolution are not the\nabsolutely final things. Only when this farther step of faith concerning\nGod is taken, and remote objective consequences are predicted, does\nreligion, as it seems to me, get wholly free from the first immediate\nsubjective experience, and bring a _real hypothesis_ into play. A good\nhypothesis in science must have other properties than those of the\nphenomenon it is immediately invoked to explain, otherwise it is not\nprolific enough. God, meaning only what enters into the religious man\u2019s\nexperience of union, falls short of being an hypothesis of this more\nuseful order. He needs to enter into wider cosmic relations in order to\njustify the subject\u2019s absolute confidence and peace.\nThat the God with whom, starting from the hither side of our own extra\u2010\nmarginal self, we come at its remoter margin into commerce should be the\nabsolute world\u2010ruler, is of course a very considerable over\u2010belief. Over\u2010\nbelief as it is, though, it is an article of almost every one\u2019s religion.\nMost of us pretend in some way to prop it upon our philosophy, but the\nphilosophy itself is really propped upon this faith. What is this but to\nsay that Religion, in her fullest exercise of function, is not a mere\nillumination of facts already elsewhere given, not a mere passion, like\nlove, which views things in a rosier light. It is indeed that, as we have\nseen abundantly. But it is something more, namely, a postulator of new\n_facts_ as well. The world interpreted religiously is not the\nmaterialistic world over again, with an altered expression; it must have,\nover and above the altered expression, _a natural constitution_ different\nat some point from that which a materialistic world would have. It must be\nsuch that different events can be expected in it, different conduct must\nbe required.\nThis thoroughly \u201cpragmatic\u201d view of religion has usually been taken as a\nmatter of course by common men. They have interpolated divine miracles\ninto the field of nature, they have built a heaven out beyond the grave.\nIt is only transcendentalist metaphysicians who think that, without adding\nany concrete details to Nature, or subtracting any, but by simply calling\nit the expression of absolute spirit, you make it more divine just as it\nstands.\nI believe the pragmatic way of taking religion to be the deeper way. It\ngives it body as well as soul, it makes it claim, as everything real must\nclaim, some characteristic realm of fact as its very own. What the more\ncharacteristically divine facts are, apart from the actual inflow of\nenergy in the faith\u2010state and the prayer\u2010state, I know not. But the over\u2010\nbelief on which I am ready to make my personal venture is that they exist.\nThe whole drift of my education goes to persuade me that the world of our\npresent consciousness is only one out of many worlds of consciousness that\nexist, and that those other worlds must contain experiences which have a\nmeaning for our life also; and that although in the main their experiences\nand those of this world keep discrete, yet the two become continuous at\ncertain points, and higher energies filter in. By being faithful in my\npoor measure to this over\u2010belief, I seem to myself to keep more sane and\ntrue. I _can_, of course, put myself into the sectarian scientist\u2019s\nattitude, and imagine vividly that the world of sensations and of\nscientific laws and objects may be all. But whenever I do this, I hear\nthat inward monitor of which W. K. Clifford once wrote, whispering the\nword \u201cbosh!\u201d Humbug is humbug, even though it bear the scientific name,\nand the total expression of human experience, as I view it objectively,\ninvincibly urges me beyond the narrow \u201cscientific\u201d bounds. Assuredly, the\nreal world is of a different temperament,\u2014more intricately built than\nphysical science allows. So my objective and my subjective conscience both\nhold me to the over\u2010belief which I express. Who knows whether the\nfaithfulness of individuals here below to their own poor over\u2010beliefs may\nnot actually help God in turn to be more effectively faithful to his own\ngreater tasks?\nPOSTSCRIPT.\nIn writing my concluding lecture I had to aim so much at simplification\nthat I fear that my general philosophic position received so scant a\nstatement as hardly to be intelligible to some of my readers. I therefore\nadd this epilogue, which must also be so brief as possibly to remedy but\nlittle the defect. In a later work I may be enabled to state my position\nmore amply and consequently more clearly.\nOriginality cannot be expected in a field like this, where all the\nattitudes and tempers that are possible have been exhibited in literature\nlong ago, and where any new writer can immediately be classed under a\nfamiliar head. If one should make a division of all thinkers into\nnaturalists and supernaturalists, I should undoubtedly have to go, along\nwith most philosophers, into the supernaturalist branch. But there is a\ncrasser and a more refined supernaturalism, and it is to the refined\ndivision that most philosophers at the present day belong. If not regular\ntranscendental idealists, they at least obey the Kantian direction enough\nto bar out ideal entities from interfering causally in the course of\nphenomenal events. Refined supernaturalism is universalistic\nsupernaturalism; for the \u201ccrasser\u201d variety \u201cpiecemeal\u201d supernaturalism\nwould perhaps be the better name. It went with that older theology which\nto\u2010day is supposed to reign only among uneducated people, or to be found\namong the few belated professors of the dualisms which Kant is thought to\nhave displaced. It admits miracles and providential leadings, and finds no\nintellectual difficulty in mixing the ideal and the real worlds together\nby interpolating influences from the ideal region among the forces that\ncausally determine the real world\u2019s details. In this the refined\nsupernaturalists think that it muddles disparate dimensions of existence.\nFor them the world of the ideal has no efficient causality, and never\nbursts into the world of phenomena at particular points. The ideal world,\nfor them, is not a world of facts, but only of the meaning of facts; it is\na point of view for judging facts. It appertains to a different \u201c\u2010ology,\u201d\nand inhabits a different dimension of being altogether from that in which\nexistential propositions obtain. It cannot get down upon the flat level of\nexperience and interpolate itself piecemeal between distinct portions of\nnature, as those who believe, for example, in divine aid coming in\nresponse to prayer, are bound to think it must.\nNotwithstanding my own inability to accept either popular Christianity or\nscholastic theism, I suppose that my belief that in communion with the\nIdeal new force comes into the world, and new departures are made here\nbelow, subjects me to being classed among the supernaturalists of the\npiecemeal or crasser type. Universalistic supernaturalism surrenders, it\nseems to me, too easily to naturalism. It takes the facts of physical\nscience at their face\u2010value, and leaves the laws of life just as\nnaturalism finds them, with no hope of remedy, in case their fruits are\nbad. It confines itself to sentiments about life as a whole, sentiments\nwhich may be admiring and adoring, but which need not be so, as the\nexistence of systematic pessimism proves. In this universalistic way of\ntaking the ideal world, the essence of practical religion seems to me to\nevaporate. Both instinctively and for logical reasons, I find it hard to\nbelieve that principles can exist which make no difference in facts.(360)\nBut all facts are particular facts, and the whole interest of the question\nof God\u2019s existence seems to me to lie in the consequences for particulars\nwhich that existence may be expected to entail. That no concrete\nparticular of experience should alter its complexion in consequence of a\nGod being there seems to me an incredible proposition, and yet it is the\nthesis to which (implicitly at any rate) refined supernaturalism seems to\ncling. It is only with experience _en bloc_, it says, that the Absolute\nmaintains relations. It condescends to no transactions of detail.\nI am ignorant of Buddhism and speak under correction, and merely in order\nthe better to describe my general point of view; but as I apprehend the\nBuddhistic doctrine of Karma, I agree in principle with that. All\nsupernaturalists admit that facts are under the judgment of higher law;\nbut for Buddhism as I interpret it, and for religion generally so far as\nit remains unweakened by transcendentalistic metaphysics, the word\n\u201cjudgment\u201d here means no such bare academic verdict or platonic\nappreciation as it means in Vedantic or modern absolutist systems; it\ncarries, on the contrary, _execution_ with it, is _in __ rebus_ as well as\n_post rem_, and operates \u201ccausally\u201d as partial factor in the total fact.\nThe universe becomes a gnosticism(361) pure and simple on any other terms.\nBut this view that judgment and execution go together is that of the\ncrasser supernaturalist way of thinking, so the present volume must on the\nwhole be classed with the other expressions of that creed.\nI state the matter thus bluntly, because the current of thought in\nacademic circles runs against me, and I feel like a man who must set his\nback against an open door quickly if he does not wish to see it closed and\nlocked. In spite of its being so shocking to the reigning intellectual\ntastes, I believe that a candid consideration of piecemeal supernaturalism\nand a complete discussion of all its metaphysical bearings will show it to\nbe the hypothesis by which the largest number of legitimate requirements\nare met. That of course would be a program for other books than this; what\nI now say sufficiently indicates to the philosophic reader the place where\nI belong.\nIf asked just where the differences in fact which are due to God\u2019s\nexistence come in, I should have to say that in general I have no\nhypothesis to offer beyond what the phenomenon of \u201cprayerful communion,\u201d\nespecially when certain kinds of incursion from the subconscious region\ntake part in it, immediately suggests. The appearance is that in this\nphenomenon something ideal, which in one sense is part of ourselves and in\nanother sense is not ourselves, actually exerts an influence, raises our\ncentre of personal energy, and produces regenerative effects unattainable\nin other ways. If, then, there be a wider world of being than that of our\nevery\u2010day consciousness, if in it there be forces whose effects on us are\nintermittent, if one facilitating condition of the effects be the openness\nof the \u201csubliminal\u201d door, we have the elements of a theory to which the\nphenomena of religious life lend plausibility. I am so impressed by the\nimportance of these phenomena that I adopt the hypothesis which they so\nnaturally suggest. At these places at least, I say, it would seem as\nthough transmundane energies, God, if you will, produced immediate effects\nwithin the natural world to which the rest of our experience belongs.\nThe difference in natural \u201cfact\u201d which most of us would assign as the\nfirst difference which the existence of a God ought to make would, I\nimagine, be personal immortality. Religion, in fact, for the great\nmajority of our own race _means_ immortality, and nothing else. God is the\nproducer of immortality; and whoever has doubts of immortality is written\ndown as an atheist without farther trial. I have said nothing in my\nlectures about immortality or the belief therein, for to me it seems a\nsecondary point. If our ideals are only cared for in \u201ceternity,\u201d I do not\nsee why we might not be willing to resign their care to other hands than\nours. Yet I sympathize with the urgent impulse to be present ourselves,\nand in the conflict of impulses, both of them so vague yet both of them\nnoble, I know not how to decide. It seems to me that it is eminently a\ncase for facts to testify. Facts, I think, are yet lacking to prove\n\u201cspirit\u2010return,\u201d though I have the highest respect for the patient labors\nof Messrs. Myers, Hodgson, and Hyslop, and am somewhat impressed by their\nfavorable conclusions. I consequently leave the matter open, with this\nbrief word to save the reader from a possible perplexity as to why\nimmortality got no mention in the body of this book.\nThe ideal power with which we feel ourselves in connection, the \u201cGod\u201d of\nordinary men, is, both by ordinary men and by philosophers, endowed with\ncertain of those metaphysical attributes which in the lecture on\nphilosophy I treated with such disrespect. He is assumed as a matter of\ncourse to be \u201cone and only\u201d and to be \u201cinfinite\u201d; and the notion of many\nfinite gods is one which hardly any one thinks it worth while to consider,\nand still less to uphold. Nevertheless, in the interests of intellectual\nclearness, I feel bound to say that religious experience, as we have\nstudied it, cannot be cited as unequivocally supporting the infinitist\nbelief. The only thing that it unequivocally testifies to is that we can\nexperience union with _something_ larger than ourselves and in that union\nfind our greatest peace. Philosophy, with its passion for unity, and\nmysticism with its monoideistic bent, both \u201cpass to the limit\u201d and\nidentify the something with a unique God who is the all\u2010inclusive soul of\nthe world. Popular opinion, respectful to their authority, follows the\nexample which they set.\nMeanwhile the practical needs and experiences of religion seem to me\nsufficiently met by the belief that beyond each man and in a fashion\ncontinuous with him there exists a larger power which is friendly to him\nand to his ideals. All that the facts require is that the power should be\nboth other and larger than our conscious selves. Anything larger will do,\nif only it be large enough to trust for the next step. It need not be\ninfinite, it need not be solitary. It might conceivably even be only a\nlarger and more godlike self, of which the present self would then be but\nthe mutilated expression, and the universe might conceivably be a\ncollection of such selves, of different degrees of inclusiveness, with no\nabsolute unity realized in it at all.(362) Thus would a sort of polytheism\nreturn upon us\u2014a polytheism which I do not on this occasion defend, for my\nonly aim at present is to keep the testimony of religious experience\nclearly within its proper bounds. [Compare p. 132 above.]\nUpholders of the monistic view will say to such a polytheism (which, by\nthe way, has always been the real religion of common people, and is so\nstill to\u2010day) that unless there be one all\u2010inclusive God, our guarantee of\nsecurity is left imperfect. In the Absolute, and in the Absolute only,\n_all_ is saved. If there be different gods, each caring for his part, some\nportion of some of us might not be covered with divine protection, and our\nreligious consolation would thus fail to be complete. It goes back to what\nwas said on pages 131\u2010133, about the possibility of there being portions\nof the universe that may irretrievably be lost. Common sense is less\nsweeping in its demands than philosophy or mysticism have been wont to be,\nand can suffer the notion of this world being partly saved and partly\nlost. The ordinary moralistic state of mind makes the salvation of the\nworld conditional upon the success with which each unit does its part.\nPartial and conditional salvation is in fact a most familiar notion when\ntaken in the abstract, the only difficulty being to determine the details.\nSome men are even disinterested enough to be willing to be in the unsaved\nremnant as far as their persons go, if only they can be persuaded that\ntheir cause will prevail\u2014all of us are willing, whenever our activity\u2010\nexcitement rises sufficiently high. I think, in fact, that a final\nphilosophy of religion will have to consider the pluralistic hypothesis\nmore seriously than it has hitherto been willing to consider it. For\npractical life at any rate, the _chance_ of salvation is enough. No fact\nin human nature is more characteristic than its willingness to live on a\nchance. The existence of the chance makes the difference, as Edmund Gurney\nsays, between a life of which the keynote is resignation and a life of\nwhich the keynote is hope.(363) But all these statements are\nunsatisfactory from their brevity, and I can only say that I hope to\nreturn to the same questions in another book.\nINDEX.\nAbsolute, oneness with the, 419.\nAbstractness of religious objects, 53.\nACHILLES, 86.\nACKERMANN, MADAME, 63.\nAdaptation to environment, of things, 438;\nof saints, 374\u2010377.\n\u00c6sthetic elements in religions, 460.\nAlacoque, 310, 344, 413.\nAlcohol, 387.\nAL\u2010GHAZZALI, 402.\nALI, 341.\nALLEINE, 228.\nALLINE, 159, 217.\nAlternations of personality, 193.\nALVAREZ DE PAZ, 116.\nAMIEL, 394.\nAn\u00e6sthesia, 288.\nAn\u00e6sthetic revelation, 387\u2010393.\nANGELUS SILESIUS, 417.\nAnger, 181, 264.\n\u201cAnhedonia,\u201d 145.\nAristocratic type, 371.\nARISTOTLE, 495.\nArs, le Cur\u00e9 d\u2019, 302.\nAsceticism, 273, 296\u2010310, 360\u2010365.\nAseity, God\u2019s, 439, 445.\nAtman, 400.\nAttributes of God, 440;\ntheir \u00e6sthetic use, 458.\nAUGUSTINE, SAINT, 171, 361, 496.\nAURELIUS, see MARCUS.\nAutomatic writing, 62, 478.\nAutomatisms, 234, 250, 478\u2010483.\nBALDWIN, 347, 503.\nBASHKIRTSEFF, 83.\nBEECHER, 256.\nBEHMEN, see BOEHME.\nBelief, due to non\u2010rationalistic impulses, 73.\nBESANT, MRS., 23, 168.\nBhagavad\u2010Gita, 361.\nBLAVATSKY, MADAM, 421.\nBLOOD, 389.\nBLUMHARDT, 113.\nBOEHME, 410, 417, 418.\nBOOTH, 203.\nBOUGAUD, 344.\nBOURGET, 263.\nBOURIGNON, 321.\nBOWNE, 502.\nBRAINERD, 212, 253.\nBRAY, 249, 256, 290.\nBROOKS, 512.\nBROWNELL, 515.\nBUCKE, 398.\nBuddhism, 31, 34, 522.\nBuddhist mysticism, 401.\nBULLEN, 287.\nBUNYAN, 157, 160.\nBUTTERWORTH, 411.\nCAIRD, EDWARD, 106.\nCAIRD, J., on feeling in religion, 434;\non absolute self, 450;\nhe does not prove, but reaffirms, religion\u2019s dicta, 453.\nCALL, 289.\nCARLYLE, 41, 300.\nCARPENTER, 319.\nCatharine, Saint, of Genoa, 289.\nCatholicism and Protestantism compared, 114, 227, 336, 461.\nCausality of God, 517, 522.\nCause, 502.\nCENNICK, 301.\nCentres of personal energy, 196, 267, 523.\nCerebration, unconscious, 207.\nChance, 526.\nCHANNING, 300, 488.\nCHAPMAN, 324.\nCharacter, cause of its alterations, 193;\nscheme of its differences of type, 197, 214.\nCauses of its diversity, 261;\nbalance of, 340.\nCharity, 274, 278, 310, 355.\nChastity, 310.\nChiefs of tribes, 371.\nChristian Science, 106.\nChrist\u2019s atonement, 129, 245.\nChurches, 335, 460.\nCLARK, 389.\nCLISSOLD, 481.\nCOE, 240.\nConduct, perfect, 355.\nConfession, 462.\nConsciousness, fields of, 231;\nsubliminal, 233.\nConsistency, 296.\nConversion, to avarice, 178.\nConversion, Fletcher\u2019s, 181;\nTolstoy\u2019s, 184;\nBunyan\u2019s, 186;\nin general, Lectures IX and X, passim;\nBradley\u2019s, 189;\ncompared with natural moral growth, 199;\nHadley\u2019s, 201;\ntwo types of, 205 ff.;\nBrainerd\u2019s, 212;\nAlline\u2019s, 217;\nOxford graduate\u2019s, 221;\nRatisbonne\u2019s, 223;\ninstantaneous, 227;\nis it a natural phenomenon? 230;\nsubliminal action involved, in sudden cases, 236, 240;\nfruits of, 237;\nits momentousness, 239;\nmay be supernatural, 242;\nits concomitants:\nsense of higher control, 244,\nhappiness, 248,\nautomatisms, 250,\nluminous phenomena, 251;\nits degree of permanence, 256.\nCosmic consciousness, 398.\nCounter\u2010conversion, 176.\nCourage, 265, 287.\nCrankiness, see Psychopathy.\nCRICHTON\u2010BROWNE, 384, 386.\nCriminal character, 263.\nCriteria of value of spiritual affections, 18.\nCRUMP, 239.\nCure of bad habits, 270.\nDAUDET, 167.\nDeath, 139, 364.\nDERHAM, 493.\nDesign, argument from, 438, 492 ff.\nDevoutness, 340.\nDIONYSIUS AREOPAGITICUS, 416.\nDisease, 99, 113.\nDisorder in contents of world, 438.\nDivided Self, Lecture VIII, passim;\nCases of:\nSaint Augustine, 172,\nH.

ideas that float in the air of one\u2019s time, this notion\nshrinks from dogmatic general statement and expresses itself only\npartially and by innuendo. It seems to me that few conceptions are\nless instructive than this re\u2010interpretation of religion as\nperverted sexuality. It reminds one, so crudely is it often\nemployed, of the famous Catholic taunt, that the Reformation may be\nbest understood by remembering that its _fons et origo_ was Luther\u2019s\nwish to marry a nun:\u2014the effects are infinitely wider than the\nalleged causes, and for the most part opposite in nature. It is true\nthat in the vast collection of religious phenomena, some are\nundisguisedly amatory\u2014e.g., sex\u2010deities and obscene rites in\npolytheism, and ecstatic feelings of union with the Saviour in a few\nChristian mystics. But then why not equally call religion an\naberration of the digestive function, and prove one\u2019s point by the\nworship of Bacchus and Ceres, or by the ecstatic feelings of some\nother saints about the Eucharist? Religious language clothes itself\nin such poor symbols as our life affords, and the whole organism\ngives overtones of comment whenever the mind is strongly stirred to\nexpression. Language drawn from eating and drinking is probably as\ncommon in religious literature as is language drawn from the sexual\nlife. We \u201chunger and thirst\u201d after righteousness; we \u201cfind the Lord\na sweet savor;\u201d we \u201ctaste and see that he is good.\u201d \u201cSpiritual milk\nfor American babes, drawn from the breasts of both testaments,\u201d is a\nsub\u2010title of the once famous New England Primer, and Christian\ndevotional literature indeed quite floats in milk, thought of from\nthe point of view, not of the mother, but of the greedy babe.\nSaint Fran\u00e7ois de Sales, for instance, thus describes the \u201corison of\nquietude\u201d: \u201cIn this state the soul is like a little child still at\nthe breast, whose mother, to caress him whilst he is still in her\narms, makes her milk distill into his mouth without his even moving\nhis lips. So it is here.... Our Lord desires that our will should be\nsatisfied with sucking the milk which His Majesty pours into our\nmouth, and that we should relish the sweetness without even knowing\nthat it cometh from the Lord.\u201d And again: \u201cConsider the little\ninfants, united and joined to the breasts of their nursing mothers,\nyou will see that from time to time they press themselves closer by\nlittle starts to which the pleasure of sucking prompts them. Even\nso, during its orison, the heart united to its God oftentimes makes\nattempts at closer union by movements during which it presses closer\nupon the divine sweetness.\u201d Chemin de la Perfection, ch. xxxi.;\nAmour de Dieu, vii. ch. i.\nIn fact, one might almost as well interpret religion as a perversion\nof the respiratory function. The Bible is full of the language of\nrespiratory oppression: \u201cHide not thine ear at my breathing; my\ngroaning is not hid from thee; my heart panteth, my strength faileth\nme; my bones are hot with my roaring all the night long; as the hart\npanteth after the water\u2010brooks, so my soul panteth after thee, O my\nGod.\u201d _God\u2019s Breath in Man_ is the title of the chief work of our\nbest known American mystic (Thomas Lake Harris); and in certain non\u2010\nChristian countries the foundation of all religious discipline\nconsists in regulation of the inspiration and expiration.\nThese arguments are as good as much of the reasoning one hears in\nfavor of the sexual theory. But the champions of the latter will\nthen say that their chief argument has no analogue elsewhere. The\ntwo main phenomena of religion, namely, melancholy and conversion,\nthey will say, are essentially phenomena of adolescence, and\ntherefore synchronous with the development of sexual life. To which\nthe retort again is easy. Even were the asserted synchrony\nunrestrictedly true as a fact (which it is not), it is not only the\nsexual life, but the entire higher mental life which awakens during\nadolescence. One might then as well set up the thesis that the\ninterest in mechanics, physics, chemistry, logic, philosophy, and\nsociology, which springs up during adolescent years along with that\nin poetry and religion, is also a perversion of the sexual\ninstinct:\u2014but that would be too absurd. Moreover, if the argument\nfrom synchrony is to decide, what is to be done with the fact that\nthe religious age _par excellence_ would seem to be old age, when\nthe uproar of the sexual life is past?\nThe plain truth is that to interpret religion one must in the end\nlook at the immediate content of the religious consciousness. The\nmoment one does this, one sees how wholly disconnected it is in the\nmain from the content of the sexual consciousness. Everything about\nthe two things differs, objects, moods, faculties concerned, and\nacts impelled to. Any _general_ assimilation is simply impossible:\nwhat we find most often is complete hostility and contrast. If now\nthe defenders of the sex\u2010theory say that this makes no difference to\ntheir thesis; that without the chemical contributions which the sex\u2010\norgans make to the blood, the brain would not be nourished so as to\ncarry on religious activities, this final proposition may be true or\nnot true; but at any rate it has become profoundly uninstructive: we\ncan deduce no consequences from it which help us to interpret\nreligion\u2019s meaning or value. In this sense the religious life\ndepends just as much upon the spleen, the pancreas, and the kidneys\nas on the sexual apparatus, and the whole theory has lost its point\nin evaporating into a vague general assertion of the dependence,\n_somehow_, of the mind upon the body.\n2 For a first\u2010rate example of medical\u2010materialist reasoning, see an\narticle on \u201cles Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s du Type d\u00e9vot,\u201d by Dr. Binet\u2010Sangl\u00e9, in the\nRevue de l\u2019Hypnotisme, xiv. 161.\n3 J.

They are\nreligious in the wider sense; yet in this acutest of all senses they\nare not so, and it is religion in the acutest sense that I wish,\nwithout disputing about words, to study first, so as to get at its\ntypical _differentia_.\n20 The New Spirit, p. 232.\n21 I owe this allegorical illustration to my lamented colleague and\nfriend, Charles Carroll Everett.\n22 Example: \u201cI have had much comfort lately in meditating on the\npassages which show the personality of the Holy Ghost, and his\ndistinctness from the Father and the Son. It is a subject that\nrequires searching into to find out, but, when realized, gives one\nso much more true and lively a sense of the fullness of the Godhead,\nand its work in us and to us, than when only thinking of the Spirit\nin its effect on us.\u201d AUGUSTUS HARE: Memorials, i. 244, Maria Hare\nto Lucy H.

Mind\u2010cure might be briefly called a reaction against all\nthat religion of chronic anxiety which marked the earlier part of\nour century in the evangelical circles of England and America.\n45 I refer to Mr. Horatio W. Dresser and Mr. Henry Wood, especially the\nformer. Mr. Dresser\u2019s works are published by G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons,\nNew York and London; Mr. Wood\u2019s by Lee & Shepard, Boston.\n46 Lest my own testimony be suspected, I will quote another reporter,\nDr. H. H. Goddard, of Clark University, whose thesis on \u201cthe Effects\nof Mind on Body as evidenced by Faith Cures\u201d is published in the\nAmerican Journal of Psychology for 1899 (vol. x.). This critic,\nafter a wide study of the facts, concludes that the cures by mind\u2010\ncure exist, but are in no respect different from those now\nofficially recognized in medicine as cures by suggestion; and the\nend of his essay contains an interesting physiological speculation\nas to the way in which the suggestive ideas may work (p. 67 of the\nreprint). As regards the general phenomenon of mental cure itself,\nDr. Goddard writes: \u201cIn spite of the severe criticism we have made\nof reports of cure, there still remains a vast amount of material,\nshowing a powerful influence of the mind in disease. Many cases are\nof diseases that have been diagnosed and treated by the best\nphysicians of the country, or which prominent hospitals have tried\ntheir hand at curing, but without success. People of culture and\neducation have been treated by this method with satisfactory\nresults. Diseases of long standing have been ameliorated, and even\ncured.... We have traced the mental element through primitive\nmedicine and folk\u2010medicine of to\u2010day, patent medicine, and\nwitchcraft. We are convinced that it is impossible to account for\nthe existence of these practices, if they did not cure disease, and\nthat if they cured disease, it must have been the mental element\nthat was effective. The same argument applies to those modern\nschools of mental therapeutics\u2014Divine Healing and Christian Science.\nIt is hardly conceivable that the large body of intelligent people\nwho comprise the body known distinctively as Mental Scientists\nshould continue to exist if the whole thing were a delusion. It is\nnot a thing of a day; it is not confined to a few; it is not local.\nIt is true that many failures are recorded, but that only adds to\nthe argument. There must be many and striking successes to\ncounterbalance the failures, otherwise the failures would have ended\nthe delusion.... Christian Science, Divine Healing, or Mental\nScience do not, and never can in the very nature of things, cure all\ndiseases; nevertheless, the practical applications of the general\nprinciples of the broadest mental science will tend to prevent\ndisease.... We do find sufficient evidence to convince us that the\nproper reform in mental attitude would relieve many a sufferer of\nills that the ordinary physician cannot touch; would even delay the\napproach of death to many a victim beyond the power of absolute\ncure, and the faithful adherence to a truer philosophy of life will\nkeep many a man well, and give the doctor time to devote to\nalleviating ills that are unpreventable\u201d (pp. 33, 34 of reprint).\n47 HORACE FLETCHER: Happiness as found in Forethought _minus_\nFearthought, Menticulture Series, ii.

According to Harnack, Jesus felt about evil\nand disease much as our mind\u2010curers do. \u201cWhat is the answer which\nJesus sends to John the Baptist?\u201d asks Harnack, and says it is this:\n\u201c \u2018The blind see, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and\nthe deaf hear, the dead rise up, and the gospel is preached to the\npoor.\u2019 That is the \u2018coming of the kingdom,\u2019 or rather in these\nsaving works the kingdom is already there. By the overcoming and\nremoval of misery, of need, of sickness, by these actual effects\nJohn is to see that the new time has arrived. The casting out of\ndevils is only a part of this work of redemption, _but Jesus points\nto that as the sense and seal of his mission_. Thus to the wretched,\nsick, and poor did he address himself, but not as a moralist, and\nwithout a trace of sentimentalism. He never makes groups and\ndepartments of the ills; he never spends time in asking whether the\nsick one \u2018deserves\u2019 to be cured; and it never occurs to him to\nsympathize with the pain or the death. He nowhere says that sickness\nis a beneficent infliction, and that evil has a healthy use. No, he\ncalls sickness sickness and health health. All evil, all\nwretchedness, is for him something dreadful; it is of the great\nkingdom of Satan; but he feels the power of the Saviour within him.\nHe knows that advance is possible only when weakness is overcome,\nwhen sickness is made well.\u201d Das Wesen des Christenthums, 1900, p.\n39.\n51 R. W. TRINE: In Tune with the Infinite, 26th thousand, N. Y., 1899.\nI have strung scattered passages together.\n52 The Cairds, for example. In EDWARD CAIRD\u2019S Glasgow Lectures of\n1890\u201092 passages like this abound:\u2014\n\u201cThe declaration made in the beginning of the ministry of Jesus that\n\u2018the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand,\u2019\npasses with scarce a break into the announcement that \u2018the kingdom\nof God is among you\u2019; and the importance of this announcement is\nasserted to be such that it makes, so to speak, a difference _in\nkind_ between the greatest saints and prophets who lived under the\nprevious reign of division, and \u2018the least in the kingdom of\nheaven.\u2019 The highest ideal is brought close to men and declared to\nbe within their reach, they are called on to be \u2018perfect as their\nFather in heaven is perfect.\u2019 The sense of alienation and distance\nfrom God which had grown upon the pious in Israel just in proportion\nas they had learned to look upon Him as no mere national divinity,\nbut as a God of justice who would punish Israel for its sin as\ncertainly as Edom or Moab, is declared to be no longer in place; and\nthe typical form of Christian prayer points to the abolition of the\ncontrast between this world and the next which through all the\nhistory of the Jews had continually been growing wider: \u2018As in\nheaven, so on earth.\u2019 The sense of the division of man from God, as\na finite being from the Infinite, as weak and sinful from the\nOmnipotent Goodness, is not indeed lost; but it can no longer\noverpower the consciousness of oneness. The terms \u2018Son\u2019 and \u2018Father\u2019\nat once state the opposition and mark its limit. They show that it\nis not an absolute opposition, but one which presupposes an\nindestructible principle of unity, that can and must become a\nprinciple of reconciliation.\u201d The Evolution of Religion, ii. pp.\n146, 147.\n53 It remains to be seen whether the school of Mr. Dresser, which\nassumes more and more the form of mind\u2010cure experience and academic\nphilosophy mutually impregnating each other, will score the\npractical triumphs of the less critical and rational sects.\n54 The theistic explanation is by divine grace, which creates a new\nnature within one the moment the old nature is sincerely given up.\nThe pantheistic explanation (which is that of most mind\u2010curers) is\nby the merging of the narrower private self into the wider or\ngreater self, the spirit of the universe (which is your own\n\u201csubconscious\u201d self), the moment the isolating barriers of mistrust\nand anxiety are removed. The medico\u2010materialistic explanation is\nthat simpler cerebral processes act more freely where they are left\nto act automatically by the shunting\u2010out of physiologically (though\nin this instance not spiritually) \u201chigher\u201d ones which, seeking to\nregulate, only succeed in inhibiting results.\u2014Whether this third\nexplanation might, in a psycho\u2010physical account of the universe, be\ncombined with either of the others may be left an open question\nhere.\n55 Within the churches a disposition has always prevailed to regard\nsickness as a visitation; something sent by God for our good, either\nas chastisement, as warning, or as opportunity for exercising\nvirtue, and, in the Catholic Church, of earning \u201cmerit.\u201d \u201cIllness,\u201d\nsays a good Catholic writer (P. LEJEUNE: Introd. \u00e0 la Vie Mystique,\n1899, p. 218), \u201cis the most excellent of corporeal mortifications,\nthe mortification which one has not one\u2019s self chosen, which is\nimposed directly by God, and is the direct expression of his will.\n\u2018If other mortifications are of silver,\u2019 Mgr. Gay says, \u2018this one is\nof gold; since although it comes of ourselves, coming as it does of\noriginal sin, still on its greater side, as coming (like all that\nhappens) from the providence of God, it is of divine manufacture.\nAnd how just are its blows! And how efficacious it is!... I do not\nhesitate to say that patience in a long illness is mortification\u2019s\nvery masterpiece, and consequently the triumph of mortified\nsouls.\u2019 \u201d According to this view, disease should in any case be\nsubmissively accepted, and it might under certain circumstances even\nbe blasphemous to wish it away.\nOf course there have been exceptions to this, and cures by special\nmiracle have at all times been recognized within the church\u2019s pale,\nalmost all the great saints having more or less performed them. It\nwas one of the heresies of Edward Irving, to maintain them still to\nbe possible. An extremely pure faculty of healing after confession\nand conversion on the patient\u2019s part, and prayer on the priest\u2019s,\nwas quite spontaneously developed in the German pastor, Joh.\nChristoph Blumhardt, in the early forties and exerted during nearly\nthirty years. Blumhardt\u2019s Life by Z\u00fcndel (5th edition, Zurich, 1887)\ngives in chapters ix., x., xi., and xvii. a pretty full account of\nhis healing activity, which he invariably ascribed to direct divine\ninterposition. Blumhardt was a singularly pure, simple, and non\u2010\nfanatical character, and in this part of his work followed no\nprevious model. In Chicago to\u2010day we have the case of Dr. J. A.\nDowie, a Scottish Baptist preacher, whose weekly \u201cLeaves of Healing\u201d\nwere in the year of grace 1900 in their sixth volume, and who,\nalthough he denounces the cures wrought in other sects as\n\u201cdiabolical counterfeits\u201d of his own exclusively \u201cDivine Healing,\u201d\nmust on the whole be counted into the mind\u2010cure movement. In mind\u2010\ncure circles the fundamental article of faith is that disease should\nnever be accepted. It is wholly of the pit. God wants us to be\nabsolutely healthy, and we should not tolerate ourselves on any\nlower terms.\n56 Edwards, from whose book on the Revival in New England I quote these\nwords, dissuades from such a use of prayer, but it is easy to see\nthat he enjoys making his thrust at the cold dead church members.\n57 H.

(abridged).\n69 I say this in spite of the monistic utterances of many mind\u2010cure\nwriters; for these utterances are really inconsistent with their\nattitude towards disease, and can easily be shown not to be\nlogically involved in the experiences of union with a higher\nPresence with which they connect themselves. The higher Presence,\nnamely, need not be the absolute whole of things, it is quite\nsufficient for the life of religious experience to regard it as a\npart, if only it be the most ideal part.\n70 Cf.

MILSAND: Luther et le Serf\u2010Arbitre, 1884, _passim_.\n71 He adds with characteristic healthy\u2010mindedness: \u201cOur business is to\ncontinue to fail in good spirits.\u201d\n72 The God of many men is little more than their court of appeal\nagainst the damnatory judgment passed on their failures by the\nopinion of this world. To our own consciousness there is usually a\nresiduum of worth left over after our sins and errors have been told\noff\u2014our capacity of acknowledging and regretting them is the germ of\na better self _in posse_ at least. But the world deals with us _in\nactu_ and not _in posse_: and of this hidden germ, not to be guessed\nat from without, it never takes account. Then we turn to the All\u2010\nknower, who knows our bad, but knows this good in us also, and who\nis just. We cast ourselves with our repentance on his mercy: only by\nan All\u2010knower can we finally be judged. So the need of a God very\ndefinitely emerges from this sort of experience of life.\n73 E.g., Iliad, XVII. 446: \u201cNothing then is more wretched anywhere than\nman of all that breathes and creeps upon this earth.\u201d\n74 E.g., Theognis, 425\u2010428: \u201cBest of all for all things upon earth is\nit not to be born nor to behold the splendors of the Sun; next best\nto traverse as soon as possible the gates of Hades.\u201d See also the\nalmost identical passage in \u0152dipus in Colonus, 1225.\u2014The Anthology\nis full of pessimistic utterances: \u201cNaked came I upon the earth,\nnaked I go below the ground\u2014why then do I vainly toil when I see the\nend naked before me?\u201d\u2014\u201cHow did I come to be? Whence am I? Wherefore\ndid I come? To pass away. How can I learn aught when naught I know?\nBeing naught I came to life: once more shall I be what I was.\nNothing and nothingness is the whole race of mortals.\u201d\u2014\u201cFor death we\nare all cherished and fattened like a herd of hogs that is wantonly\nbutchered.\u201d\nThe difference between Greek pessimism and the oriental and modern\nvariety is that the Greeks had not made the discovery that the\npathetic mood may be idealized, and figure as a higher form of\nsensibility. Their spirit was still too essentially masculine for\npessimism to be elaborated or lengthily dwelt on in their classic\nliterature. They would have despised a life set wholly in a minor\nkey, and summoned it to keep within the proper bounds of\nlachrymosity. The discovery that the enduring emphasis, so far as\nthis world goes, may be laid on its pain and failure, was reserved\nfor races more complex, and (so to speak) more feminine than the\nHellenes had attained to being in the classic period. But all the\nsame was the outlook of those Hellenes blackly pessimistic.\n75 For instance, on the very day on which I write this page, the post\nbrings me some aphorisms from a worldly\u2010wise old friend in\nHeidelberg which may serve as a good contemporaneous expression of\nEpicureanism: \u201cBy the word \u2018happiness\u2019 every human being understands\nsomething different. It is a phantom pursued only by weaker minds.\nThe wise man is satisfied with the more modest but much more\ndefinite term _contentment_. What education should chiefly aim at is\nto save us from a discontented life. Health is one favoring\ncondition, but by no means an indispensable one, of contentment.\nWoman\u2019s heart and love are a shrewd device of Nature, a trap which\nshe sets for the average man, to force him into working. But the\nwise man will always prefer work chosen by himself.\u201d\n76 RIBOT: Psychologie des sentiments, p. 54.\n77 A. GRATRY: Souvenirs de ma jeunesse, 1880, pp. 119\u2010121, abridged.\nSome persons are affected with anhedonia permanently, or at any rate\nwith a loss of the usual appetite for life. The annals of suicide\nsupply such examples as the following:\u2014\nAn uneducated domestic servant, aged nineteen, poisons herself, and\nleaves two letters expressing her motive for the act. To her parents\nshe writes:\u2014\n\u201cLife is sweet perhaps to some, but I prefer what is sweeter than\nlife, and that is death. So good\u2010by forever, my dear parents. It is\nnobody\u2019s fault, but a strong desire of my own which I have longed to\nfulfill for three or four years. I have always had a hope that some\nday I might have an opportunity of fulfilling it, and now it has\ncome.... It is a wonder I have put this off so long, but I thought\nperhaps I should cheer up a bit and put all thought out of my head.\u201d\nTo her brother she writes: \u201cGood\u2010by forever, my own dearest brother.\nBy the time you get this I shall be gone forever.

I owe my acquaintance with this book to my colleague, Dr.\nBenjamin Rand.\n83 Compare Bunyan: \u201cThere was I struck into a very great trembling,\ninsomuch that at some times I could, for days together, feel my very\nbody, as well as my mind, to shake and totter under the sense of the\ndreadful judgment of God, that should fall on those that have sinned\nthat most fearful and unpardonable sin. I felt also such clogging\nand heat at my stomach, by reason of this my terror, that I was,\nespecially at some times, as if my breast\u2010bone would have split\nasunder.... Thus did I wind, and twine, and shrink, under the burden\nthat was upon me; which burden also did so oppress me that I could\nneither stand, nor go, nor lie, either at rest or quiet.\u201d\n84 For another case of fear equally sudden, see HENRY JAMES: Society\nthe Redeemed Form of Man, Boston, 1879, pp. 43 ff.\n85 Example: \u201cIt was about eleven o\u2019clock at night ... but I strolled on\nstill with the people.... Suddenly upon the left side of our road, a\ncrackling was heard among the bushes; all of us were alarmed, and in\nan instant a tiger, rushing out of the jungle, pounced upon the one\nof the party that was foremost, and carried him off in the twinkling\nof an eye. The rush of the animal, and the crush of the poor\nvictim\u2019s bones in his mouth, and his last cry of distress, \u2018Ho hai!\u2019\ninvoluntarily re\u00ebchoed by all of us, was over in three seconds; and\nthen I know not what happened till I returned to my senses, when I\nfound myself and companions lying down on the ground as if prepared\nto be devoured by our enemy, the sovereign of the forest. I find my\npen incapable of describing the terror of that dreadful moment. Our\nlimbs stiffened, our power of speech ceased, and our hearts beat\nviolently, and only a whisper of the same \u2018Ho hai!\u2019 was heard from\nus. In this state we crept on all fours for some distance back, and\nthen ran for life with the speed of an Arab horse for about half an\nhour, and fortunately happened to come to a small village.... After\nthis every one of us was attacked with fever, attended with\nshivering, in which deplorable state we remained till\nmorning.\u201d\u2014Autobiography of Lutfullah, a Mohammedan Gentleman,\nLeipzig, 1857, p. 112.\n86 E.g., \u201cOur young people are diseased with the theological problems\nof original sin, origin of evil, predestination, and the like.

D. 386) that the\naccount he gives in the Confessions is premature. The crisis in the\ngarden marked a definitive conversion from his former life, but it\nwas to the neo\u2010platonic spiritualism and only a halfway stage toward\nChristianity. The latter he appears not fully and radically to have\nembraced until four years more had passed.\n92 Confessions, Book VIII., chaps. v., vii., xi., abridged.\n93 TH. JOUFFROY: Nouveaux M\u00e9langes philosophiques, 2me \u00e9dition, p. 83.\nI add two other cases of counter\u2010conversion dating from a certain\nmoment. The first is from Professor Starbuck\u2019s manuscript\ncollection, and the narrator is a woman.\n\u201cAway down in the bottom of my heart, I believe I was always more or\nless skeptical about \u2018God;\u2019 skepticism grew as an undercurrent, all\nthrough my early youth, but it was controlled and covered by the\nemotional elements in my religious growth. When I was sixteen I\njoined the church and was asked if I loved God. I replied \u2018Yes,\u2019 as\nwas customary and expected. But instantly with a flash something\nspoke within me, \u2018No, you do not.\u2019 I was haunted for a long time\nwith shame and remorse for my falsehood and for my wickedness in not\nloving God, mingled with fear that there might be an avenging God\nwho would punish me in some terrible way.... At nineteen, I had an\nattack of tonsilitis. Before I had quite recovered, I heard told a\nstory of a brute who had kicked his wife downstairs, and then\ncontinued the operation until she became insensible. I felt the\nhorror of the thing keenly. Instantly this thought flashed through\nmy mind: \u2018I have no use for a God who permits such things.\u2019 This\nexperience was followed by months of stoical indifference to the God\nof my previous life, mingled with feelings of positive dislike and a\nsomewhat proud defiance of him. I still thought there might be a\nGod. If so he would probably damn me, but I should have to stand it.\nI felt very little fear and no desire to propitiate him. I have\nnever had any personal relations with him since this painful\nexperience.\u201d\nThe second case exemplifies how small an additional stimulus will\noverthrow the mind into a new state of equilibrium when the process\nof preparation and incubation has proceeded far enough. It is like\nthe proverbial last straw added to the camel\u2019s burden, or that touch\nof a needle which makes the salt in a supersaturated fluid suddenly\nbegin to crystallize out.\nTolstoy writes: \u201cS., a frank and intelligent man, told me as follows\nhow he ceased to believe:\u2014\n\u201cHe was twenty\u2010six years old when one day on a hunting expedition,\nthe time for sleep having come, he set himself to pray according to\nthe custom he had held from childhood.\n\u201cHis brother, who was hunting with him, lay upon the hay and looked\nat him. When S. had finished his prayer and was turning to sleep,\nthe brother said, \u2018Do you still keep up that thing?\u2019 Nothing more\nwas said. But since that day, now more than thirty years ago, S. has\nnever prayed again; he never takes communion, and does not go to\nchurch. All this, not because he became acquainted with convictions\nof his brother which he then and there adopted; not because he made\nany new resolution in his soul, but merely because the words spoken\nby his brother were like the light push of a finger against a\nleaning wall already about to tumble by its own weight. These words\nbut showed him that the place wherein he supposed religion dwelt in\nhim had long been empty, and that the sentences he uttered, the\ncrosses and bows which he made during his prayer, were actions with\nno inner sense. Having once seized their absurdity, he could no\nlonger keep them up.\u201d My Confession, p. 8.\n94 Op. cit., Letter III., abridged.\nI subjoin an additional document which has come into my possession,\nand which represents in a vivid way what is probably a very frequent\nsort of conversion, if the opposite of \u201cfalling in love,\u201d falling\nout of love, may be so termed. Falling in love also conforms\nfrequently to this type, a latent process of unconscious preparation\noften preceding a sudden awakening to the fact that the mischief is\nirretrievably done. The free and easy tone in this narrative gives\nit a sincerity that speaks for itself.\n\u201cFor two years of this time I went through a very bad experience,\nwhich almost drove me mad. I had fallen violently in love with a\ngirl who, young as she was, had a spirit of coquetry like a cat. As\nI look back on her now, I hate her, and wonder how I could ever have\nfallen so low as to be worked upon to such an extent by her\nattractions. Nevertheless, I fell into a regular fever, could think\nof nothing else; whenever I was alone, I pictured her attractions,\nand spent most of the time when I should have been working, in\nrecalling our previous interviews, and imagining future\nconversations. She was very pretty, good humored, and jolly to the\nlast degree, and intensely pleased with my admiration. Would give me\nno decided answer yes or no, and the queer thing about it was that\nwhilst pursuing her for her hand, I secretly knew all along that she\nwas unfit to be a wife for me, and that she never would say yes.\nAlthough for a year we took our meals at the same boarding\u2010house, so\nthat I saw her continually and familiarly, our closer relations had\nto be largely on the sly, and this fact, together with my jealousy\nof another one of her male admirers, and my own conscience despising\nme for my uncontrollable weakness, made me so nervous and sleepless\nthat I really thought I should become insane. I understand well\nthose young men murdering their sweethearts, which appear so often\nin the papers. Nevertheless I did love her passionately, and in some\nways she did deserve it.\n\u201cThe queer thing was the sudden and unexpected way in which it all\nstopped. I was going to my work after breakfast one morning,\nthinking as usual of her and of my misery, when, just as if some\noutside power laid hold of me, I found myself turning round and\nalmost running to my room, where I immediately got out all the\nrelics of her which I possessed, including some hair, all her notes\nand letters, and ambrotypes on glass. The former I made a fire of,\nthe latter I actually crushed beneath my heel, in a sort of fierce\njoy of revenge and punishment. I now loathed and despised her\naltogether, and as for myself I felt as if a load of disease had\nsuddenly been removed from me. That was the end. I never spoke to\nher or wrote to her again in all the subsequent years, and I have\nnever had a single moment of loving thought towards one who for so\nmany months entirely filled my heart. In fact, I have always rather\nhated her memory, though now I can see that I had gone unnecessarily\nfar in that direction. At any rate, from that happy morning onward I\nregained possession of my own proper soul, and have never since\nfallen into any similar trap.\u201d\nThis seems to me an unusually clear example of two different levels\nof personality, inconsistent in their dictates, yet so well balanced\nagainst each other as for a long time to fill the life with discord\nand dissatisfaction. At last, not gradually, but in a sudden crisis,\nthe unstable equilibrium is resolved, and this happens so\nunexpectedly that it is as if, to use the writer\u2019s words, \u201csome\noutside power laid hold.\u201d\nProfessor Starbuck gives an analogous case, and a converse case of\nhatred suddenly turning into love, in his Psychology of Religion, p.\n141. Compare the other highly curious instances which he gives on\npp. 137\u2010144, of sudden non\u2010religious alterations of habit or\ncharacter. He seems right in conceiving all such sudden changes as\nresults of special cerebral functions unconsciously developing until\nthey are ready to play a controlling part, when they make irruption\ninto the conscious life. When we treat of sudden \u201cconversion,\u201d I\nshall make as much use as I can of this hypothesis of subconscious\nincubation.\n95 H.

Madison,\nConnecticut, 1830.\n99 Jouffroy is an example: \u201cDown this slope it was that my intelligence\nhad glided, and little by little it had got far from its first\nfaith. But this melancholy revolution had not taken place in the\nbroad daylight of my consciousness; too many scruples, too many\nguides and sacred affections had made it dreadful to me, so that I\nwas far from avowing to myself the progress it had made. It had gone\non in silence, by an involuntary elaboration of which I was not the\naccomplice; and although I had in reality long ceased to be a\nChristian, yet, in the innocence of my intention, I should have\nshuddered to suspect it, and thought it calumny had I been accused\nof such a falling away.\u201d Then follows Jouffroy\u2019s account of his\ncounter\u2010conversion, quoted above on p. 176.\n100 One hardly needs examples; but for love, see p. 179, note; for fear,\np. 162; for remorse, see Othello after the murder; for anger, see\nLear after Cordelia\u2019s first speech to him; for resolve, see p. 178\n(J. Foster case). Here is a pathological case in which _guilt_ was\nthe feeling that suddenly exploded: \u201cOne night I was seized on\nentering bed with a rigor, such as Swedenborg describes as coming\nover him with a sense of holiness, but over me with a sense of\n_guilt_. During that whole night I lay under the influence of the\nrigor, and from its inception I felt that I was under the curse of\nGod. I have never done one act of duty in my life\u2014sins against God\nand man, beginning as far as my memory goes back\u2014a wildcat in human\nshape.\u201d\n101 E. D. STARBUCK: The Psychology of Religion, pp. 224, 262.\n102 No one understands this better than Jonathan Edwards understood it\nalready. Conversion narratives of the more commonplace sort must\nalways be taken with the allowances which he suggests: \u201cA rule\nreceived and established by common consent has a very great, though\nto many persons an insensible influence in forming their notions of\nthe process of their own experience. I know very well how they\nproceed as to this matter, for I have had frequent opportunities of\nobserving their conduct. Very often their experience at first\nappears like a confused chaos, but then those parts are selected\nwhich bear the nearest resemblance to such particular steps as are\ninsisted on; and these are dwelt upon in their thoughts, and spoken\nof from time to time, till they grow more and more conspicuous in\ntheir view, and other parts which are neglected grow more and more\nobscure. Thus what they have experienced is insensibly strained, so\nas to bring it to an exact conformity to the scheme already\nestablished in their minds. And it becomes natural also for\nministers, who have to deal with those who insist upon distinctness\nand clearness of method, to do so too.\u201d Treatise on Religious\nAffections.\n103 Studies in the Psychology of Religious Phenomena, American Journal\nof Psychology, vii. 309 (1896).\n104 I have abridged Mr. Hadley\u2019s account.

Compare, also, pp. 137\u2010144 and 262.\n110 For instance, C. G. Finney italicizes the volitional element: \u201cJust\nat this point the whole question of Gospel salvation opened to my\nmind in a manner most marvelous to me at the time. I think I then\nsaw, as clearly as I ever have in my life, the reality and fullness\nof the atonement of Christ. Gospel salvation seemed to me to be an\noffer of something to be accepted, and all that was necessary on my\npart was to get my own consent to give up my sins and accept Christ.\nAfter this distinct revelation had stood for some little time before\nmy mind, the question seemed to be put, \u2018Will you accept it now, to\u2010\nday?\u2019 I replied, \u2018Yes; _I will accept it to\u2010day, or I will die in\nthe attempt!_\u2019 \u201d He then went into the woods, where he describes his\nstruggles. He could not pray, his heart was hardened in its pride.\n\u201cI then reproached myself for having promised to give my heart to\nGod before I left the woods. When I came to try, I found I could\nnot.... My inward soul hung back, and there was no going out of my\nheart to God. The thought was pressing me, of the rashness of my\npromise that I would give my heart to God that day, or die in the\nattempt. It seemed to me as if that was binding on my soul; and yet\nI was going to break my vow. A great sinking and discouragement came\nover me, and I felt almost too weak to stand upon my knees. Just at\nthis moment I again thought I heard some one approach me, and I\nopened my eyes to see whether it were so. But right there the\nrevelation of my pride of heart, as the great difficulty that stood\nin the way, was distinctly shown to me. An overwhelming sense of my\nwickedness in being ashamed to have a human being see me on my knees\nbefore God took such powerful possession of me, that I _cried at the\ntop of my voice, and exclaimed that I would not leave that place if\nall the men on earth and all the devils in hell surrounded me_.\n\u2018What!\u2019 I said, \u2018such a degraded sinner as I am, on my knees\nconfessing my sins to the great and holy God; and ashamed to have\nany human being, and a sinner like myself, find me on my knees\nendeavoring to make my peace with my offended God!\u2019 The sin appeared\nawful, infinite. It broke me down before the Lord.\u201d Memoirs, pp.\n14\u201016, abridged.\n111 STARBUCK: Op. cit., pp. 91, 114.\n112 Extracts from the Journal of Mr. John Nelson, London, no date, p.\n24.\n113 STARBUCK, p. 64.\n114 STARBUCK, p. 115.\n115 STARBUCK, p. 113.\n116 EDWARD\u2019S and DWIGHT\u2019S Life of Brainerd, New Haven, 1822, pp. 45\u201047,\nabridged.\n117 Describing the whole phenomenon as a change of equilibrium, we might\nsay that the movement of new psychic energies towards the personal\ncentre and the recession of old ones towards the margin (or the\nrising of some objects above, and the sinking of others below the\nconscious threshold) were only two ways of describing an indivisible\nevent. Doubtless this is often absolutely true, and Starbuck is\nright when he says that \u201cself\u2010surrender\u201d and \u201cnew determination,\u201d\nthough seeming at first sight to be such different experiences, are\n\u201creally the same thing.

M. A. Ratisbonne, Ferrara, 1843, which I have\nto thank Monsignore D. O\u2019Connell of Rome for bringing to my notice.\nI abridge the original.\n122 Published in the International Scientific Series.\n123 The reader will here please notice that in my exclusive reliance in\nthe last lecture on the subconscious \u201cincubation\u201d of motives\ndeposited by a growing experience, I followed the method of\nemploying accepted principles of explanation as far as one can. The\nsubliminal region, whatever else it may be, is at any rate a place\nnow admitted by psychologists to exist for the accumulation of\nvestiges of sensible experience (whether inattentively or\nattentively registered), and for their elaboration according to\nordinary psychological or logical laws into results that end by\nattaining such a \u201ctension\u201d that they may at times enter\nconsciousness with something like a burst. It thus is \u201cscientific\u201d\nto interpret all otherwise unaccountable invasive alterations of\nconsciousness as results of the tension of subliminal memories\nreaching the bursting\u2010point. But candor obliges me to confess that\nthere are occasional bursts into consciousness of results of which\nit is not easy to demonstrate any prolonged subconscious incubation.\nSome of the cases I used to illustrate the sense of presence of the\nunseen in Lecture III were of this order (compare pages 59, 61, 62,\n67); and we shall see other experiences of the kind when we come to\nthe subject of mysticism. The case of Mr. Bradley, that of M.\nRatisbonne, possibly that of Colonel Gardiner, possibly that of\nSaint Paul, might not be so easily explained in this simple way. The\nresult, then, would have to be ascribed either to a merely\nphysiological nerve storm, a \u201cdischarging lesion\u201d like that of\nepilepsy; or, in case it were useful and rational, as in the two\nlatter cases named, to some more mystical or theological hypothesis.\nI make this remark in order that the reader may realize that the\nsubject is really complex. But I shall keep myself as far as\npossible at present to the more \u201cscientific\u201d view; and only as the\nplot thickens in subsequent lectures shall I consider the question\nof its absolute sufficiency as an explanation of all the facts. That\nsubconscious incubation explains a great number of them, there can\nbe no doubt.\n124 Edwards says elsewhere: \u201cI am bold to say that the work of God in\nthe conversion of one soul, considered together with the source,\nfoundation, and purchase of it, and also the benefit, end, and\neternal issue of it, is a more glorious work of God than the\ncreation of the whole material universe.\u201d\n125 Emerson writes: \u201cWhen we see a soul whose acts are regal, graceful,\nand pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such things can be and\nare, and not turn sourly on the angel and say: Crump is a better\nman, with his grunting resistance to all his native devils.\u201d True\nenough. Yet Crump may really be the better _Crump_, for his inner\ndiscords and second birth; and your once\u2010born \u201cregal\u201d character,\nthough indeed always better than poor Crump, may fall far short of\nwhat he individually might be had he only some Crump\u2010like capacity\nfor compunction over his own peculiar diabolisms, graceful and\npleasant and invariably gentlemanly as these may be.\n126 In his book, The Spiritual Life, New York, 1900.\n127 Op. cit., p. 112.\n128 Op. cit., p. 144.\n129 I piece together a quotation made by W.

Why does he not say \u201cthe\natoning work\u201d?\u2019 Then these words, \u2018It is finished,\u2019 presented\nthemselves to my mind. \u2018What is it that is finished?\u2019 I asked, and\nin an instant my mind replied: \u2018A perfect expiation for sin; entire\nsatisfaction has been given; the debt has been paid by the\nSubstitute. Christ has died for our sins; not for ours only, but for\nthose of all men. If, then, the entire work is finished, all the\ndebt paid, what remains for me to do?\u2019 In another instant the light\nwas shed through my mind by the Holy Ghost, and the joyous\nconviction was given me that nothing more was to be done, save to\nfall on my knees, to accept this Saviour and his love, to praise God\nforever.\u201d Autobiography of Hudson Taylor. I translate back into\nEnglish from the French translation of Challand (Geneva, no date),\nthe original not being accessible.\n132 Tolstoy\u2019s case was a good comment on those words. There was almost\nno theology in his conversion.

SPRAGUE: Lectures on Revivals of Religion, New\nYork, 1832, in the long Appendix to which the opinions of a large\nnumber of ministers are given.\n138 Memoirs, p. 34.\n139 These reports of sensorial photism shade off into what are evidently\nonly metaphorical accounts of the sense of new spiritual\nillumination, as, for instance, in Brainerd\u2019s statement: \u201cAs I was\nwalking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory seemed to open to the\napprehension of my soul. I do not mean any external brightness, for\nI saw no such thing, nor any imagination of a body of light in the\nthird heavens, or anything of that nature, but it was a new inward\napprehension or view that I had of God.\u201d\nIn a case like this next one from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection,\nthe lighting up of the darkness is probably also metaphorical:\u2014\n\u201cOne Sunday night, I resolved that when I got home to the ranch\nwhere I was working, I would offer myself with my faculties and all\nto God to be used only by and for him.... It was raining and the\nroads were muddy; but this desire grew so strong that I kneeled down\nby the side of the road and told God all about it, intending then to\nget up and go on. Such a thing as any special answer to my prayer\nnever entered my mind, having been converted by faith, but still\nbeing most undoubtedly saved. Well, while I was praying, I remember\nholding out my hands to God and telling him they should work for\nhim, my feet walk for him, my tongue speak for him, etc., etc., if\nhe would only use me as his instrument and give me a satisfying\nexperience\u2014when suddenly the darkness of the night seemed lit up\u2014I\nfelt, realized, knew, that God heard and answered my prayer. Deep\nhappiness came over me; I felt I was accepted into the inner circle\nof God\u2019s loved ones.\u201d\nIn the following case also the flash of light is metaphorical:\u2014\n\u201cA prayer meeting had been called for at close of evening service.\nThe minister supposed me impressed by his discourse (a mistake\u2014he\nwas dull). He came and, placing his hand upon my shoulder, said: \u2018Do\nyou not want to give your heart to God?\u2019 I replied in the\naffirmative. Then said he, \u2018Come to the front seat.\u2019 They sang and\nprayed and talked with me. I experienced nothing but unaccountable\nwretchedness. They declared that the reason why I did not \u2018obtain\npeace\u2019 was because I was not willing to give up all to God. After\nabout two hours the minister said we would go home. As usual, on\nretiring, I prayed. In great distress, I at this time simply said,\n\u2018Lord, I have done all I can, I leave the whole matter with thee.\u2019\nImmediately, like a flash of light, there came to me a great peace,\nand I arose and went into my parents\u2019 bedroom and said, \u2018I do feel\nso wonderfully happy.\u2019 This I regard as the hour of conversion. It\nwas the hour in which I became assured of divine acceptance and\nfavor. So far as my life was concerned, it made little immediate\nchange.\u201d\n140 I add in a note a few more records:\u2014\n\u201cOne morning, being in deep distress, fearing every moment I should\ndrop into hell, I was constrained to cry in earnest for mercy, and\nthe Lord came to my relief, and delivered my soul from the burden\nand guilt of sin. My whole frame was in a tremor from head to foot,\nand my soul enjoyed sweet peace. The pleasure I then felt was\nindescribable. The happiness lasted about three days, during which\ntime I never spoke to any person about my feelings.\u201d Autobiography\nof DAN YOUNG, edited by W. P. STRICKLAND, New York, 1860.\n\u201cIn an instant there rose up in me such a sense of God\u2019s taking care\nof those who put their trust in him that for an hour all the world\nwas crystalline, the heavens were lucid, and I sprang to my feet and\nbegan to cry and laugh.\u201d H. W. BEECHER, quoted by LEUBA.\n\u201cMy tears of sorrow changed to joy, and I lay there praising God in\nsuch ecstasy of joy as only the soul who experiences it can\nrealize.\u201d\u2014\u201cI cannot express how I felt. It was as if I had been in a\ndark dungeon and lifted into the light of the sun. I shouted and I\nsang praise unto him who loved me and washed me from my sins. I was\nforced to retire into a secret place, for the tears did flow, and I\ndid not wish my shopmates to see me, and yet I could not keep it a\nsecret.\u201d\u2014\u201cI experienced joy almost to weeping.\u201d\u2014\u201cI felt my face must\nhave shone like that of Moses. I had a general feeling of buoyancy.\nIt was the greatest joy it was ever my lot to experience.\u201d\u2014\u201cI wept\nand laughed alternately. I was as light as if walking on air. I felt\nas if I had gained greater peace and happiness than I had ever\nexpected to experience.\u201d STARBUCK\u2019S correspondents.\n141 Psychology of Religion, pp. 360, 357.\n142 SAINTE\u2010BEUVE: Port\u2010Royal, vol. i. pp. 95 and 106, abridged.\n143 \u201c \u2018Love would not be love,\u2019 says Bourget, \u2018unless it could carry one\nto crime.\u2019 And so one may say that no passion would be a veritable\npassion unless it could carry one to crime.\u201d (SIGHELE: Psychologie\ndes Sectes, p. 136.) In other words, great passions annul the\nordinary inhibitions set by \u201cconscience.\u201d And conversely, of all the\ncriminal human beings, the false, cowardly, sensual, or cruel\npersons who actually live, there is perhaps not one whose criminal\nimpulse may not be at some moment overpowered by the presence of\nsome other emotion to which his character is also potentially\nliable, provided that other emotion be only made intense enough.\nFear is usually the most available emotion for this result in this\nparticular class of persons. It stands for conscience, and may here\nbe classed appropriately as a \u201chigher affection.\u201d If we are soon to\ndie, or if we believe a day of judgment to be near at hand, how\nquickly do we put our moral house in order\u2014we do not see how sin can\nevermore exert temptation over us! Old\u2010fashioned hell\u2010fire\nChristianity well knew how to extract from fear its full equivalent\nin the way of fruits for repentance, and its full conversion value.\n144 Example: Benjamin Constant was often marveled at as an extraordinary\ninstance of superior intelligence with inferior character. He writes\n(Journal, Paris, 1895, p. 56), \u201cI am tossed and dragged about by my\nmiserable weakness. Never was anything so ridiculous as my\nindecision. Now marriage, now solitude; now Germany, now France,\nhesitation upon hesitation, and all because at bottom I am _unable\nto give up anything_.\u201d He can\u2019t \u201cget mad\u201d at any of his\nalternatives; and the career of a man beset by such an all\u2010round\namiability is hopeless.\n145 The great thing which the higher excitabilities give is _courage_;\nand the addition or subtraction of a certain amount of this quality\nmakes a different man, a different life. Various excitements let the\ncourage loose. Trustful hope will do it; inspiring example will do\nit; love will do it; wrath will do it. In some people it is natively\nso high that the mere touch of danger does it, though danger is for\nmost men the great inhibitor of action. \u201cLove of adventure\u201d becomes\nin such persons a ruling passion. \u201cI believe,\u201d says General\nSkobeleff, \u201cthat my bravery is simply the passion and at the same\ntime the contempt of danger. The risk of life fills me with an\nexaggerated rapture. The fewer there are to share it, the more I\nlike it. The participation of my body in the event is required to\nfurnish me an adequate excitement. Everything intellectual appears\nto me to be reflex; but a meeting of man to man, a duel, a danger\ninto which I can throw myself headforemost, attracts me, moves me,\nintoxicates me. I am crazy for it, I love it, I adore it. I run\nafter danger as one runs after women; I wish it never to stop. Were\nit always the same, it would always bring me a new pleasure. When I\nthrow myself into an adventure in which I hope to find it, my heart\npalpitates with the uncertainty; I could wish at once to have it\nappear and yet to delay. A sort of painful and delicious shiver\nshakes me; my entire nature runs to meet the peril with an impetus\nthat my will would in vain try to resist.\u201d (JULIETTE ADAM: Le\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ral Skobeleff, Nouvelle Revue, 1886, abridged.) Skobeleff seems\nto have been a cruel egoist; but the disinterested Garibaldi, if one\nmay judge by his \u201cMemorie,\u201d lived in an unflagging emotion of\nsimilar danger\u2010seeking excitement.\n146 See the case on p. 70, above, where the writer describes his\nexperiences of communion with the Divine as consisting \u201cmerely in\nthe _temporary obliteration of the conventionalities_ which usually\ncover my life.\u201d\n147 Above, p. 201. \u201cThe only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is\nreligiomania,\u201d is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical\nman.\n148 Doddridge\u2019s Life of Colonel James Gardiner, London Religious Tract\nSociety, pp. 23\u201032.\n149 Here, for example, is a case, from Starbuck\u2019s book, in which a\n\u201csensory automatism\u201d brought about quickly what prayers and resolves\nhad been unable to effect. The subject is a woman. She writes:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I was about forty I tried to quit smoking, but the desire was\non me, and had me in its power. I cried and prayed and promised God\nto quit, but could not. I had smoked for fifteen years. When I was\nfifty\u2010three, as I sat by the fire one day smoking, a voice came to\nme. I did not hear it with my ears, but more as a dream or sort of\ndouble think. It said, \u2018Louisa, lay down smoking.\u2019 At once I\nreplied, \u2018Will you take the desire away?\u2019 But it only kept saying:\n\u2018Louisa, lay down smoking.\u2019 Then I got up, laid my pipe on the\nmantel\u2010shelf, and never smoked again or had any desire to. The\ndesire was gone as though I had never known it or touched tobacco.\nThe sight of others smoking and the smell of smoke never gave me the\nleast wish to touch it again.\u201d The Psychology of Religion, p. 142.\n150 Professor Starbuck expresses the radical destruction of old\ninfluences physiologically, as a cutting off of the connection\nbetween higher and lower cerebral centres. \u201cThis condition,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cin which the association\u2010centres connected with the spiritual\nlife are cut off from the lower, is often reflected in the way\ncorrespondents describe their experiences.... For example:\n\u2018Temptations from without still assail me, but there is nothing\n_within_ to respond to them.\u2019 The ego [here] is wholly identified\nwith the higher centres, whose quality of feeling is that of\nwithinness. Another of the respondents says: \u2018Since then, although\nSatan tempts me, there is as it were a wall of brass around me, so\nthat his darts cannot touch me.\u2019 \u201d\u2014Unquestionably, functional\nexclusions of this sort must occur in the cerebral organ. But on the\nside accessible to introspection, their causal condition is nothing\nbut the degree of spiritual excitement, getting at last so high and\nstrong as to be sovereign; and it must be frankly confessed that we\ndo not know just why or how such sovereignty comes about in one\nperson and not in another. We can only give our imagination a\ncertain delusive help by mechanical analogies.\nIf we should conceive, for example, that the human mind, with its\ndifferent possibilities of equilibrium, might be like a many\u2010sided\nsolid with different surfaces on which it could lie flat, we might\nliken mental revolutions to the spatial revolutions of such a body.\nAs it is pried up, say by a lever, from a position in which it lies\non surface A, for instance, it will linger for a time unstably\nhalfway up, and if the lever cease to urge it, it will tumble back\nor \u201crelapse\u201d under the continued pull of gravity. But if at last it\nrotate far enough for its centre of gravity to pass beyond surface A\naltogether, the body will fall over, on surface B, say, and abide\nthere permanently. The pulls of gravity towards A have vanished, and\nmay now be disregarded. The polyhedron has become immune against\nfarther attraction from their direction.\nIn this figure of speech the lever may correspond to the emotional\ninfluences making for a new life, and the initial pull of gravity to\nthe ancient drawbacks and inhibitions. So long as the emotional\ninfluence fails to reach a certain pitch of efficacy, the changes it\nproduces are unstable, and the man relapses into his original\nattitude. But when a certain intensity is attained by the new\nemotion, a critical point is passed, and there then ensues an\nirreversible revolution, equivalent to the production of a new\nnature.\n151 I use this word in spite of a certain flavor of \u201csanctimoniousness\u201d\nwhich sometimes clings to it, because no other word suggests as well\nthe exact combination of affections which the text goes on to\ndescribe.\n152 \u201cIt will be found,\u201d says Dr. W. R. INGE (in his lectures on\nChristian Mysticism, London, 1899, p. 326), \u201cthat men of pre\u00ebminent\nsaintliness agree very closely in what they tell us. They tell us\nthat they have arrived at an unshakable conviction, not based on\ninference but on immediate experience, that God is a spirit with\nwhom the human spirit can hold intercourse; that in him meet all\nthat they can imagine of goodness, truth, and beauty; that they can\nsee his footprints everywhere in nature, and feel his presence\nwithin them as the very life of their life, so that in proportion as\nthey come to themselves they come to him. They tell us what\nseparates us from him and from happiness is, first, self\u2010seeking in\nall its forms; and, secondly, sensuality in all its forms; that\nthese are the ways of darkness and death, which hide from us the\nface of God; while the path of the just is like a shining light,\nwhich shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d\n153 The \u201centhusiasm of humanity\u201d may lead to a life which coalesces in\nmany respects with that of Christian saintliness. Take the following\nrules proposed to members of the Union pour l\u2019Action morale, in the\nBulletin de l\u2019Union, April 1\u201015, 1894. See, also, Revue Bleue,\nAugust 13, 1892.\n\u201cWe would make known in our own persons the usefulness of rule, of\ndiscipline, of resignation and renunciation; we would teach the\nnecessary perpetuity of suffering, and explain the creative part\nwhich it plays. We would wage war upon false optimism; on the base\nhope of happiness coming to us ready made; on the notion of a\nsalvation by knowledge alone, or by material civilization alone,\nvain symbol as this is of civilization, precarious external\narrangement, ill\u2010fitted to replace the intimate union and consent of\nsouls. We would wage war also on bad morals, whether in public or in\nprivate life; on luxury, fastidiousness, and over\u2010refinement; on all\nthat tends to increase the painful, immoral, and anti\u2010social\nmultiplication of our wants; on all that excites envy and dislike in\nthe soul of the common people, and confirms the notion that the\nchief end of life is freedom to enjoy. We would preach by our\nexample the respect of superiors and equals, the respect of all men;\naffectionate simplicity in our relations with inferiors and\ninsignificant persons; indulgence where our own claims only are\nconcerned, but firmness in our demands where they relate to duties\ntowards others or towards the public.\n\u201cFor the common people are what we help them to become; their vices\nare our vices, gazed upon, envied, and imitated; and if they come\nback with all their weight upon us, it is but just.\u201d\n154 Above, pp. 248 ff.\n155 H.

He loved me so much that he seemed to pervade my being, at a\ntime when I could be only imperfectly conscious of his presence. My\nsleep is sometimes broken,\u2014a sort of half sleep; but my soul seems\nto be awake enough to know God, when it is hardly capable of knowing\nanything else.\u201d T. C.

On being asked why he permitted\nthe animal thus to dirty his clothes, Towianski replied: \u2018This dog,\nwhom I am now meeting for the first time, has shown a great fellow\u2010\nfeeling for me, and a great joy in my recognition and acceptance of\nhis greetings. Were I to drive him off, I should wound his feelings\nand do him a moral injury. It would be an offense not only to him,\nbut to all the spirits of the other world who are on the same level\nwith him. The damage which he does to my coat is as nothing in\ncomparison with the wrong which I should inflict upon him, in case I\nwere to remain indifferent to the manifestations of his friendship.\nWe ought,\u2019 he added, \u2018both to lighten the condition of animals,\nwhenever we can, and at the same time to facilitate in ourselves\nthat union of the world of all spirits, which the sacrifice of\nChrist has made possible.\u2019 \u201d Andr\u00e9 Towianski, Traduction de\nl\u2019Italien, Turin, 1897 (privately printed).

Then\nhe asked him if he would give up to be used of the Lord the four\nhundred dollars he had laid up, and he said he would, and thus the\nLord saved him. The thought came to me at once that I had never made\na real consecration either of myself or of my property to the Lord,\nbut had always tried to serve the Lord in _my_ way. Now the Lord\nasked me if I would serve him in _his_ way, and go out alone and\npenniless if he so ordered. The question was pressed home, and I\nmust decide: To forsake all and have him, or have all and lose him!\nI soon decided to take him; and the blessed assurance came, that he\nhad taken me for his own, and my joy was full. I returned home from\nthe meeting with feelings as simple as a child. I thought all would\nbe glad to hear of the joy of the Lord that possessed me, and so I\nbegan to tell the simple story. But to my great surprise, the\npastors (for I attended meetings in three churches) opposed the\nexperience and said it was fanaticism, and one told the members of\nhis church to shun those that professed it, and I soon found that my\nfoes were those of my own household.\u201d\n196 J.

Vamb\u00e9ry\ndescribes a dervish whom he met in Persia, \u201cwho had solemnly vowed,\nthirty years before, that he would never employ his organs of speech\notherwise but in uttering, everlastingly, the name of his favorite,\n_Ali, Ali_. He thus wished to signify to the world that he was the\nmost devoted partisan of that Ali who had been dead a thousand\nyears. In his own home, speaking with his wife, children, and\nfriends, no other word but \u2018Ali!\u2019 ever passed his lips. If he wanted\nfood or drink or anything else, he expressed his wants still by\nrepeating \u2018Ali!\u2019 Begging or buying at the bazaar, it was always\n\u2018Ali!\u2019 Treated ill or generously, he would still harp on his\nmonotonous \u2018Ali!\u2019 Latterly his zeal assumed such tremendous\nproportions that, like a madman, he would race, the whole day, up\nand down the streets of the town, throwing his stick high up into\nthe air, and shriek out, all the while, at the top of his voice,\n\u2018Ali!\u2019 This dervish was venerated by everybody as a saint, and\nreceived everywhere with the greatest distinction.\u201d ARMINIUS\nVAMB\u00c9RY, his Life and Adventures, written by Himself, London, 1889,\np. 69.

After having\ngently breathed them in, He arose, and said with a gratified air to\nthe Saints, as if contented with what He had done: \u2018See the new\npresent which my betrothed has given Me!\u2019\n\u201cOne day, at chapel, she heard supernaturally sung the words,\n\u2018_Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus_.\u2019 The Son of God leaning towards her\nlike a sweet lover, and giving to her soul the softest kiss, said to\nher at the second Sanctus: \u2018In this _Sanctus_ addressed to my\nperson, receive with this kiss all the sanctity of my divinity and\nof my humanity, and let it be to thee a sufficient preparation for\napproaching the communion table.\u2019 And the next following Sunday,\nwhile she was thanking God for this favor, behold the Son of God,\nmore beauteous than thousands of angels, takes her in His arms as if\nHe were proud of her, and presents her to God the Father, in that\nperfection of sanctity with which He had dowered her. And the Father\ntook such delight in this soul thus presented by His only Son, that,\nas if unable longer to restrain Himself, He gave her, and the Holy\nGhost gave her also, the Sanctity attributed to each by His own\n_Sanctus_\u2014and thus she remained endowed with the plenary fullness of\nthe blessing of _Sanctity_, bestowed on her by Omnipotence, by\nWisdom, and by Love.\u201d R\u00e9v\u00e9lations de Sainte Gertrude, Paris, 1898,\ni. 44, 186.\n205 FURNEAUX JORDAN: Character in Birth and Parentage, first edition.\nLater editions change the nomenclature.\n206 As to this distinction, see the admirably practical account in J.

MURISIER (Les Maladies du\nSentiment Religieux, Paris, 1901), who makes inner unification the\nmainspring of the whole religious life. But _all_ strongly ideal\ninterests, religious or irreligious, unify the mind and tend to\nsubordinate everything to themselves. One would infer from M.\nMurisier\u2019s pages that this formal condition was peculiarly\ncharacteristic of religion, and that one might in comparison almost\nneglect material content, in studying the latter. I trust that the\npresent work will convince the reader that religion has plenty of\nmaterial content which is characteristic, and which is more\nimportant by far than any general psychological form. In spite of\nthis criticism, I find M. Murisier\u2019s book highly instructive.\n208 Example: \u201cAt the first beginning of the Servitor\u2019s [Suso\u2019s] interior\nlife, after he had purified his soul properly by confession, he\nmarked out for himself, in thought, three circles, within which he\nshut himself up, as in a spiritual intrenchment. The first circle\nwas his cell, his chapel, and the choir. When he was within this\ncircle, he seemed to himself in complete security. The second circle\nwas the whole monastery as far as the outer gate. The third and\noutermost circle was the gate itself, and here it was necessary for\nhim to stand well upon his guard. When he went outside these\ncircles, it seemed to him that he was in the plight of some wild\nanimal which is outside its hole, and surrounded by the hunt, and\ntherefore in need of all its cunning and watchfulness.\u201d The Life of\nthe Blessed Henry Suso, by Himself, translated by KNOX, London,\n1865, p. 168.\n209 Vie des premi\u00e8res Religieuses Dominicaines de la Congr\u00e9gation de St.\nDominique, \u00e0 Nancy; Nancy, 1896, p. 129.\n210 MESCHLER\u2019S Life of Saint Louis of Gonzaga, French translation by\nLEBR\u00c9QUIER, 1891; p. 40.\n211 In his boyish note\u2010book he praises the monastic life for its freedom\nfrom sin, and for the imperishable treasures, which it enables us to\nstore up, \u201cof merit in God\u2019s eyes which makes of Him our debtor for\nall Eternity.\u201d Loc. cit., p. 62.\n212 Mademoiselle Mori, a novel quoted in HARE\u2019S Walks in Rome, 1900, i.\n55.\nI cannot resist the temptation to quote from Starbuck\u2019s book, p.\n388, another case of purification by elimination. It runs as\nfollows:\u2014\n\u201cThe signs of abnormality which sanctified persons show are of\nfrequent occurrence. They get out of tune with other people; often\nthey will have nothing to do with churches, which they regard as\nworldly; they become hypercritical towards others; they grow\ncareless of their social, political, and financial obligations. As\nan instance of this type may be mentioned a woman of sixty\u2010eight of\nwhom the writer made a special study. She had been a member of one\nof the most active and progressive churches in a busy part of a\nlarge city. Her pastor described her as having reached the\ncensorious stage. She had grown more and more out of sympathy with\nthe church; her connection with it finally consisted simply in\nattendance at prayer\u2010meeting, at which her only message was that of\nreproof and condemnation of the others for living on a low plane. At\nlast she withdrew from fellowship with any church. The writer found\nher living alone in a little room on the top story of a cheap\nboarding\u2010house, quite out of touch with all human relations, but\napparently happy in the enjoyment of her own spiritual blessings.\nHer time was occupied in writing booklets on sanctification\u2014page\nafter page of dreamy rhapsody. She proved to be one of a small group\nof persons who claim that entire salvation involves three steps\ninstead of two; not only must there be conversion and\nsanctification, but a third, which they call \u2018crucifixion\u2019 or\n\u2018perfect redemption,\u2019 and which seems to bear the same relation to\nsanctification that this bears to conversion. She related how the\nSpirit had said to her, \u2018Stop going to church. Stop going to\nholiness meetings. Go to your own room and I will teach you.\u2019 She\nprofesses to care nothing for colleges, or preachers, or churches,\nbut only cares to listen to what God says to her. Her description of\nher experience seemed entirely consistent; she is happy and\ncontented, and her life is entirely satisfactory to herself. While\nlistening to her own story, one was tempted to forget that it was\nfrom the life of a person who could not live by it in conjunction\nwith her fellows.\u201d\n213 The best missionary lives abound in the victorious combination of\nnon\u2010resistance with personal authority. John G. Paton, for example,\nin the New Hebrides, among brutish Melanesian cannibals, preserves a\ncharmed life by dint of it. When it comes to the point, no one ever\ndares actually to strike him. Native converts, inspired by him,\nshowed analogous virtue. \u201cOne of our chiefs, full of the Christ\u2010\nkindled desire to seek and to save, sent a message to an inland\nchief, that he and four attendants would come on Sabbath and tell\nthem the gospel of Jehovah God. The reply came back sternly\nforbidding their visit, and threatening with death any Christian\nthat approached their village. Our chief sent in response a loving\nmessage, telling them that Jehovah had taught the Christians to\nreturn good for evil, and that they would come unarmed to tell them\nthe story of how the Son of God came into the world and died in\norder to bless and save his enemies. The heathen chief sent back a\nstern and prompt reply once more: \u2018If you come, you will be killed.\u2019\nOn Sabbath morn the Christian chief and his four companions were met\noutside the village by the heathen chief, who implored and\nthreatened them once more. But the former said:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018We come to you without weapons of war! We come only to tell you\nabout Jesus. We believe that He will protect us to\u2010day.\u2019\n\u201cAs they pressed steadily forward towards the village, spears began\nto be thrown at them. Some they evaded, being all except one\ndexterous warriors; and others they literally received with their\nbare hands, and turned them aside in an incredible manner. The\nheathen, apparently thunderstruck at these men thus approaching them\nwithout weapons of war, and not even flinging back their own spears\nwhich they had caught, after having thrown what the old chief called\n\u2018a shower of spears,\u2019 desisted from mere surprise. Our Christian\nchief called out, as he and his companions drew up in the midst of\nthem on the village public ground:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018Jehovah thus protects us. He has given us all your spears! Once\nwe would have thrown them back at you and killed you. But now we\ncome, not to fight but to tell you about Jesus. He has changed our\ndark hearts. He asks you now to lay down all these your other\nweapons of war, and to hear what we can tell you about the love of\nGod, our great Father, the only living God.\u2019\n\u201cThe heathen were perfectly overawed. They manifestly looked on\nthese Christians as protected by some Invisible One. They listened\nfor the first time to the story of the Gospel and of the Cross. We\nlived to see that chief and all his tribe sitting in the school of\nChrist. And there is perhaps not an island in these southern seas,\namongst all those won for Christ, where similar acts of heroism on\nthe part of converts cannot be recited.\u201d JOHN G. PATON, Missionary\nto the New Hebrides, An Autobiography, second part, London, 1890, p.\n243.\n214 Saint Peter, Saint Teresa tells us in her autobiography (French\ntranslation, p. 333), \u201chad passed forty years without ever sleeping\nmore than an hour and a half a day. Of all his mortifications, this\nwas the one that had cost him the most. To compass it, he kept\nalways on his knees or on his feet. The little sleep he allowed\nnature to take was snatched in a sitting posture, his head leaning\nagainst a piece of wood fixed in the wall. Even had he wished to lie\ndown, it would have been impossible, because his cell was only four\nfeet and a half long. In the course of all these years he never\nraised his hood, no matter what the ardor of the sun or the rain\u2019s\nstrength. He never put on a shoe. He wore a garment of coarse\nsackcloth, with nothing else upon his skin. This garment was as\nscant as possible, and over it a little cloak of the same stuff.\nWhen the cold was great he took off the cloak and opened for a while\nthe door and little window of his cell. Then he closed them and\nresumed the mantle,\u2014his way, as he told us, of warming himself, and\nmaking his body feel a better temperature. It was a frequent thing\nwith him to eat once only in three days; and when I expressed my\nsurprise, he said that it was very easy if one once had acquired the\nhabit. One of his companions has assured me that he has gone\nsometimes eight days without food.... His poverty was extreme; and\nhis mortification, even in his youth, was such that he told me he\nhad passed three years in a house of his order without knowing any\nof the monks otherwise than by the sound of their voice, for he\nnever raised his eyes, and only found his way about by following the\nothers. He showed this same modesty on public highways. He spent\nmany years without ever laying eyes upon a woman; but he confessed\nto me that at the age he had reached it was indifferent to him\nwhether he laid eyes on them or not. He was very old when I first\ncame to know him, and his body so attenuated that it seemed formed\nof nothing so much as of so many roots of trees. With all this\nsanctity he was very affable. He never spoke unless he was\nquestioned, but his intellectual right\u2010mindedness and grace gave to\nall his words an irresistible charm.\u201d\n215 F.

In a letter to Mr. B. P.

This has come\nupon me through repeating my own name to myself silently, till all\nat once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of\nindividuality, individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away\ninto boundless being, and this not a confused state but the\nclearest, the surest of the surest, utterly beyond words\u2014where death\nwas an almost laughable impossibility\u2014the loss of personality (if so\nit were) seeming no extinction, but the only true life. I am ashamed\nof my feeble description. Have I not said the state is utterly\nbeyond words?\u201d\nProfessor Tyndall, in a letter, recalls Tennyson saying of this\ncondition: \u201cBy God Almighty! there is no delusion in the matter! It\nis no nebulous ecstasy, but a state of transcendent wonder,\nassociated with absolute clearness of mind.\u201d Memoirs of Alfred\nTennyson, ii. 473.\n227 The Lancet, July 6 and 13, 1895, reprinted as the Cavendish Lecture,\non Dreamy Mental States, London, Bailli\u00e8re, 1895.

The notion is thoroughly characteristic of the mystical\nlevel, and the _Aufgabe_ of making it articulate was surely set to\nHegel\u2019s intellect by mystical feeling.\n232 BENJAMIN PAUL BLOOD: The An\u00e6sthetic Revelation and the Gist of\nPhilosophy, Amsterdam, N. Y., 1874, pp. 35, 36. Mr. Blood has made\nseveral attempts to adumbrate the an\u00e6sthetic revelation, in\npamphlets of rare literary distinction, privately printed and\ndistributed by himself at Amsterdam. Xenos Clark, a philosopher, who\ndied young at Amherst in the \u201980\u2019s, much lamented by those who knew\nhim, was also impressed by the revelation. \u201cIn the first place,\u201d he\nonce wrote to me, \u201cMr. Blood and I agree that the revelation is, if\nanything, non\u2010emotional. It is utterly flat. It is, as Mr. Blood\nsays, \u2018the one sole and sufficient insight why, or not why, but how,\nthe present is pushed on by the past, and sucked forward by the\nvacuity of the future. Its inevitableness defeats all attempts at\nstopping or accounting for it. It is all precedence and\npresupposition, and questioning is in regard to it forever too late.\nIt is an _initiation of the past_.\u2019 The real secret would be the\nformula by which the \u2018now\u2019 keeps exfoliating out of itself, yet\nnever escapes. What is it, indeed, that keeps existence exfoliating?\nThe formal being of anything, the logical definition of it, is\nstatic. For mere logic every question contains its own answer\u2014we\nsimply fill the hole with the dirt we dug out. Why are twice two\nfour? Because, in fact, four is twice two. Thus logic finds in life\nno propulsion, only a momentum. It goes because it is a\u2010going. But\nthe revelation adds: it goes because it is and _was_ a\u2010going. You\nwalk, as it were, round yourself in the revelation. Ordinary\nphilosophy is like a hound hunting his own trail. The more he hunts\nthe farther he has to go, and his nose never catches up with his\nheels, because it is forever ahead of them. So the present is\nalready a foregone conclusion, and I am ever too late to understand\nit. But at the moment of recovery from an\u00e6sthesis, just then,\n_before starting on life_, I catch, so to speak, a glimpse of my\nheels, a glimpse of the eternal process just in the act of starting.\nThe truth is that we travel on a journey that was accomplished\nbefore we set out; and the real end of philosophy is accomplished,\nnot when we arrive at, but when we remain in, our destination (being\nalready there),\u2014which may occur vicariously in this life when we\ncease our intellectual questioning. That is why there is a smile\nupon the face of the revelation, as we view it. It tells us that we\nare forever half a second too late\u2014that\u2019s all. \u2018You could kiss your\nown lips, and have all the fun to yourself,\u2019 it says, if you only\nknew the trick. It would be perfectly easy if they would just stay\nthere till you got round to them. Why don\u2019t you manage it somehow?\u201d\nDialectically minded readers of this farrago will at least recognize\nthe region of thought of which Mr. Clark writes, as familiar. In his\nlatest pamphlet, \u201cTennyson\u2019s Trances and the An\u00e6sthetic Revelation,\u201d\nMr. Blood describes its value for life as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe An\u00e6sthetic Revelation is the Initiation of Man into the\nImmemorial Mystery of the Open Secret of Being, revealed as the\nInevitable Vortex of Continuity. Inevitable is the word. Its motive\nis inherent\u2014it is what has to be. It is not for any love or hate,\nnor for joy nor sorrow, nor good nor ill. End, beginning, or\npurpose, it knows not of.\n\u201cIt affords no particular of the multiplicity and variety of things;\nbut it fills appreciation of the historical and the sacred with a\nsecular and intimately personal illumination of the nature and\nmotive of existence, which then seems reminiscent\u2014as if it should\nhave appeared, or shall yet appear, to every participant thereof.\n\u201cAlthough it is at first startling in its solemnity, it becomes\ndirectly such a matter of course\u2014so old\u2010fashioned, and so akin to\nproverbs, that it inspires exultation rather than fear, and a sense\nof safety, as identified with the aboriginal and the universal. But\nno words may express the imposing certainty of the patient that he\nis realizing the primordial, Adamic surprise of Life.\n\u201cRepetition of the experience finds it ever the same, and as if it\ncould not possibly be otherwise. The subject resumes his normal\nconsciousness only to partially and fitfully remember its\noccurrence, and to try to formulate its baffling import,\u2014with only\nthis consolatory afterthought: that he has known the oldest truth,\nand that he has done with human theories as to the origin, meaning,\nor destiny of the race. He is beyond instruction in \u2018spiritual\nthings.\u2019\n\u201cThe lesson is one of central safety: the Kingdom is within. All\ndays are judgment days: but there can be no climacteric purpose of\neternity, nor any scheme of the whole. The astronomer abridges the\nrow of bewildering figures by increasing his unit of measurement: so\nmay we reduce the distracting multiplicity of things to the unity\nfor which each of us stands.\n\u201cThis has been my moral sustenance since I have known of it. In my\nfirst printed mention of it I declared: \u2018The world is no more the\nalien terror that was taught me. Spurning the cloud\u2010grimed and still\nsultry battlements whence so lately Jehovan thunders boomed, my gray\ngull lifts her wing against the nightfall, and takes the dim leagues\nwith a fearless eye.\u2019 And now, after twenty\u2010seven years of this\nexperience, the wing is grayer, but the eye is fearless still, while\nI renew and doubly emphasize that declaration. I know\u2014as having\nknown\u2014the meaning of Existence: the sane centre of the universe\u2014at\nonce the wonder and the assurance of the soul\u2014for which the speech\nof reason has as yet no name but the An\u00e6sthetic Revelation.\u201d\u2014I have\nconsiderably abridged the quotation.\n233 Op. cit., pp. 78\u201080, abridged. I subjoin, also abridging it, another\ninteresting an\u00e6sthetic revelation communicated to me in manuscript\nby a friend in England. The subject, a gifted woman, was taking\nether for a surgical operation.\n\u201cI wondered if I was in a prison being tortured, and why I\nremembered having heard it said that people \u2018learn through\nsuffering,\u2019 and in view of what I was seeing, the inadequacy of this\nsaying struck me so much that I said, aloud, \u2018to suffer _is_ to\nlearn.\u2019\n\u201cWith that I became unconscious again, and my last dream immediately\npreceded my real coming to. It only lasted a few seconds, and was\nmost vivid and real to me, though it may not be clear in words.\n\u201cA great Being or Power was traveling through the sky, his foot was\non a kind of lightning as a wheel is on a rail, it was his pathway.\nThe lightning was made entirely of the spirits of innumerable people\nclose to one another, and I was one of them. He moved in a straight\nline, and each part of the streak or flash came into its short\nconscious existence only that he might travel. I seemed to be\ndirectly under the foot of God, and I thought he was grinding his\nown life up out of my pain. Then I saw that what he had been trying\nwith all his might to do was to _change his course_, to _bend_ the\nline of lightning to which he was tied, in the direction in which he\nwanted to go. I felt my flexibility and helplessness, and knew that\nhe would succeed. He bended me, turning his corner by means of my\nhurt, hurting me more than I had ever been hurt in my life, and at\nthe acutest point of this, as he passed, I _saw_. I understood for a\nmoment things that I have now forgotten, things that no one could\nremember while retaining sanity. The angle was an obtuse angle, and\nI remember thinking as I woke that had he made it a right or acute\nangle, I should have both suffered and \u2018seen\u2019 still more, and should\nprobably have died.\n\u201cHe went on and I came to. In that moment the whole of my life\npassed before me, including each little meaningless piece of\ndistress, and I _understood_ them. _This_ was what it had all meant,\n_this_ was the piece of work it had all been contributing to do. I\ndid not see God\u2019s purpose, I only saw his intentness and his entire\nrelentlessness towards his means. He thought no more of me than a\nman thinks of hurting a cork when he is opening wine, or hurting a\ncartridge when he is firing. And yet, on waking, my first feeling\nwas, and it came with tears, \u2018Domine non sum digna,\u2019 for I had been\nlifted into a position for which I was too small. I realized that in\nthat half hour under ether I had served God more distinctly and\npurely than I had ever done in my life before, or that I am capable\nof desiring to do. I was the means of his achieving and revealing\nsomething, I know not what or to whom, and that, to the exact extent\nof my capacity for suffering.\n\u201cWhile regaining consciousness, I wondered why, since I had gone so\ndeep, I had seen nothing of what the saints call the _love_ of God,\nnothing but his relentlessness. And then I heard an answer, which I\ncould only just catch, saying, \u2018Knowledge and Love are One, and the\n_measure_ is suffering\u2019\u2014I give the words as they came to me. With\nthat I came finally to (into what seemed a dream world compared with\nthe reality of what I was leaving), and I saw that what would be\ncalled the \u2018cause\u2019 of my experience was a slight operation under\ninsufficient ether, in a bed pushed up against a window, a common\ncity window in a common city street. If I had to formulate a few of\nthe things I then caught a glimpse of, they would run somewhat as\nfollows:\u2014\n\u201cThe eternal necessity of suffering and its eternal vicariousness.\nThe veiled and incommunicable nature of the worst sufferings;\u2014the\npassivity of genius, how it is essentially instrumental and\ndefenseless, moved, not moving, it must do what it does;\u2014the\nimpossibility of discovery without its price;\u2014finally, the excess of\nwhat the suffering \u2018seer\u2019 or genius pays over what his generation\ngains. (He seems like one who sweats his life out to earn enough to\nsave a district from famine, and just as he staggers back, dying and\nsatisfied, bringing a lac of rupees to buy grain with, God lifts the\nlac away, dropping _one_ rupee, and says, \u2018That you may give them.\nThat you have earned for them. The rest is for ME.\u2019) I perceived\nalso in a way never to be forgotten, the excess of what we see over\nwhat we can demonstrate.\n\u201cAnd so on!\u2014these things may seem to you delusions, or truisms; but\nfor me they are dark truths, and the power to put them into even\nsuch words as these has been given me by an ether dream.\u201d\n234 In Tune with the Infinite, p. 137.\n235 The larger God may then swallow up the smaller one. I take this from\nStarbuck\u2019s manuscript collection:\u2014\n\u201cI never lost the consciousness of the presence of God until I stood\nat the foot of the Horseshoe Falls, Niagara. Then I lost him in the\nimmensity of what I saw. I also lost myself, feeling that I was an\natom too small for the notice of Almighty God.\u201d\nI subjoin another similar case from Starbuck\u2019s collection:\u2014\n\u201cIn that time the consciousness of God\u2019s nearness came to me\nsometimes. I say God, to describe what is indescribable. A presence,\nI might say, yet that is too suggestive of personality, and the\nmoments of which I speak did not hold the consciousness of a\npersonality, but something in myself made me feel myself a part of\nsomething bigger than I, that was controlling. I felt myself one\nwith the grass, the trees, birds, insects, everything in Nature. I\nexulted in the mere fact of existence, of being a part of it all\u2014the\ndrizzling rain, the shadows of the clouds, the tree\u2010trunks, and so\non. In the years following, such moments continued to come, but I\nwanted them constantly. I knew so well the satisfaction of losing\nself in a perception of supreme power and love, that I was unhappy\nbecause that perception was not constant.\u201d The cases quoted in my\nthird lecture, pp. 66, 67, 70, are still better ones of this type.\nIn her essay, The Loss of Personality, in The Atlantic Monthly (vol.\nlxxxv. p. 195), Miss Ethel D. Puffer explains that the vanishing of\nthe sense of self, and the feeling of immediate unity with the\nobject, is due to the disappearance, in these rapturous experiences,\nof the motor adjustments which habitually intermediate between the\nconstant background of consciousness (which is the Self) and the\nobject in the foreground, whatever it may be. I must refer the\nreader to the highly instructive article, which seems to me to throw\nlight upon the psychological conditions, though it fails to account\nfor the rapture or the revelation\u2010value of the experience in the\nSubject\u2019s eyes.\n236 Op. cit., i. 43\u201044.\n237 Memoiren einer Idealistin, 5te Auflage, 1900, iii. 166. For years\nshe had been unable to pray, owing to materialistic belief.\n238 Whitman in another place expresses in a quieter way what was\nprobably with him a chronic mystical perception: \u201cThere is,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201capart from mere intellect, in the make\u2010up of every superior\nhuman identity, a wondrous something that realizes without argument,\nfrequently without what is called education (though I think it the\ngoal and apex of all education deserving the name), an intuition of\nthe absolute balance, in time and space, of the whole of this\nmultifariousness, this revel of fools, and incredible make\u2010believe\nand general unsettledness, we call _the world_; a soul\u2010sight of that\ndivine clue and unseen thread which holds the whole congeries of\nthings, all history and time, and all events, however trivial,\nhowever momentous, like a leashed dog in the hand of the hunter.\n[Of] such soul\u2010sight and root\u2010centre for the mind mere optimism\nexplains only the surface.\u201d Whitman charges it against Carlyle that\nhe lacked this perception.

Through the mastery which the yogi attains over his\nthoughts and his body, he grows into a \u2018character.\u2019 By the\nsubjection of his impulses and propensities to his will, and the\nfixing of the latter upon the ideal of goodness, he becomes a\n\u2018personality\u2019 hard to influence by others, and thus almost the\nopposite of what we usually imagine a \u2018medium\u2019 so\u2010called, or\n\u2018psychic subject\u2019 to be.\u201d KARL KELLNER: Yoga: Eine Skizze, M\u00fcnchen,\n1896, p. 21.\n245 I follow the account in C.

These phenomena, which\nmystics have often presented (or are believed to have presented),\nhave no essential mystical significance, for they occur with no\nconsciousness of illumination whatever, when they occur, as they\noften do, in persons of non\u2010mystical mind. Consciousness of\nillumination is for us the essential mark of \u201cmystical\u201d states.\n252 The Interior Castle, Fifth Abode, ch. i., in \u0152uvres, translated by\nBouix, iii. 421\u2010424.\n253 BARTOLI\u2010MICHEL: Vie de Saint Ignace de Loyola, i. 34\u201036. Others have\nhad illuminations about the created world, Jacob Boehme, for\ninstance. At the age of twenty\u2010five he was \u201csurrounded by the divine\nlight, and replenished with the heavenly knowledge; insomuch as\ngoing abroad into the fields to a green, at G\u00f6rlitz, he there sat\ndown, and viewing the herbs and grass of the field, in his inward\nlight he saw into their essences, use, and properties, which was\ndiscovered to him by their lineaments, figures, and signatures.\u201d Of\na later period of experience he writes: \u201cIn one quarter of an hour I\nsaw and knew more than if I had been many years together at an\nuniversity. For I saw and knew the being of all things, the Byss and\nthe Abyss, and the eternal generation of the holy Trinity, the\ndescent and original of the world and of all creatures through the\ndivine wisdom. I knew and saw in myself all the three worlds, the\nexternal and visible world being of a procreation or extern birth\nfrom both the internal and spiritual worlds; and I saw and knew the\nwhole working essence, in the evil and in the good, and the mutual\noriginal and existence; and likewise how the fruitful bearing womb\nof eternity brought forth. So that I did not only greatly wonder at\nit, but did also exceedingly rejoice, albeit I could very hardly\napprehend the same in my external man and set it down with the pen.\nFor I had a thorough view of the universe as in a chaos, wherein all\nthings are couched and wrapt up, but it was impossible for me to\nexplicate the same.\u201d Jacob Behmen\u2019s Theosophic Philosophy, etc., by\nEDWARD TAYLOR, London, 1691, pp. 425, 427, abridged.

It is not so much\na habitation, an association, as a sort of fusion. Oh, new and\nblessed life! life which becomes each day more luminous.... The wall\nbefore me, dark a few moments since, is splendid at this hour\nbecause the sun shines on it. Wherever its rays fall they light up a\nconflagration of glory; the smallest speck of glass sparkles, each\ngrain of sand emits fire; even so there is a royal song of triumph\nin my heart because the Lord is there. My days succeed each other;\nyesterday a blue sky; to\u2010day a clouded sun; a night filled with\nstrange dreams; but as soon as the eyes open, and I regain\nconsciousness and seem to begin life again, it is always the same\nfigure before me, always the same presence filling my heart....\nFormerly the day was dulled by the absence of the Lord. I used to\nwake invaded by all sorts of sad impressions, and I did not find him\non my path. To\u2010day he is with me; and the light cloudiness which\ncovers things is not an obstacle to my communion with him. I feel\nthe pressure of his hand, I feel something else which fills me with\na serene joy; shall I dare to speak it out? Yes, for it is the true\nexpression of what I experience. The Holy Spirit is not merely\nmaking me a visit; it is no mere dazzling apparition which may from\none moment to another spread its wings and leave me in my night, it\nis a permanent habitation. He can depart only if he takes me with\nhim. More than that; he is not other than myself: he is one with me.\nIt is not a juxtaposition, it is a penetration, a profound\nmodification of my nature, a new manner of my being.\u201d Quoted from\nthe MS. \u201cof an old man\u201d by WILFRED MONOD: Il Vit: six m\u00e9ditations\nsur le myst\u00e8re chr\u00e9tien, pp. 280\u2010283.\n269 Compare M.

Mysticism for him means any sudden perception of hidden\nsignificance in things. He explains such perception by the abundant\nuncompleted associations which experiences may arouse in a\ndegenerate brain. These give to him who has the experience a vague\nand vast sense of its leading further, yet they awaken no definite\nor useful consequent in his thought. The explanation is a plausible\none for certain sorts of feeling of significance; and other\nalienists (WERNICKE, for example, in his Grundriss der Psychiatrie,\nTheil ii., Leipzig, 1896) have explained \u201cparanoiac\u201d conditions by a\nlaming of the association\u2010organ. But the higher mystical flights,\nwith their positiveness and abruptness, are surely products of no\nsuch merely negative condition. It seems far more reasonable to\nascribe them to inroads from the subconscious life, of the cerebral\nactivity correlative to which we as yet know nothing.\n285 They sometimes add subjective _audita et visa_ to the facts, but as\nthese are usually interpreted as transmundane, they oblige no\nalteration in the facts of sense.\n286 Compare Professor W. WALLACE\u2019S Gifford Lectures, in Lectures and\nEssays, Oxford, 1898, pp. 17 ff.\n287 Op. cit., p. 174, abridged.\n288 Ibid., p. 186, abridged and italicized.\n289 Discourse II. \u00a7 7.\n290 As regards the secondary character of intellectual constructions,\nand the primacy of feeling and instinct in founding religious\nbeliefs, see the striking work of H. FIELDING, The Hearts of Men,\nLondon, 1902, which came into my hands after my text was written.\n\u201cCreeds,\u201d says the author, \u201care the grammar of religion, they are to\nreligion what grammar is to speech. Words are the expression of our\nwants; grammar is the theory formed afterwards. Speech never\nproceeded from grammar, but the reverse. As speech progresses and\nchanges from unknown causes, grammar must follow\u201d (p. 313). The\nwhole book, which keeps unusually close to concrete facts, is little\nmore than an amplification of this text.\n291 For convenience\u2019 sake, I follow the order of A. ST\u00d6CKL\u2019S Lehrbuch\nder Philosophie, 5te Auflage, Mainz, 1881, Band ii. B. BOEDDER\u2019S\nNatural Theology, London, 1891, is a handy English Catholic Manual;\nbut an almost identical doctrine is given by such Protestant\ntheologians as C. HODGE: Systematic Theology, New York, 1873, or A.\nH. STRONG: Systematic Theology, 5th edition, New York, 1896.\n292 It must not be forgotten that any form of _dis_order in the world\nmight, by the design argument, suggest a God for just that kind of\ndisorder. The truth is that any state of things whatever that can be\nnamed is logically susceptible of teleological interpretation. The\nruins of the earthquake at Lisbon, for example: the whole of past\nhistory had to be planned exactly as it was to bring about in the\nfullness of time just that particular arrangement of d\u00e9bris of\nmasonry, furniture, and once living bodies. No other train of causes\nwould have been sufficient. And so of any other arrangement, bad or\ngood, which might as a matter of fact be found resulting anywhere\nfrom previous conditions. To avoid such pessimistic consequences and\nsave its beneficent designer, the design argument accordingly\ninvokes two other principles, restrictive in their operation. The\nfirst is physical: Nature\u2019s forces tend of their own accord only to\ndisorder and destruction, to heaps of ruins, not to architecture.\nThis principle, though plausible at first sight, seems, in the light\nof recent biology, to be more and more improbable. The second\nprinciple is one of anthropomorphic interpretation. No arrangement\nthat for _us_ is \u201cdisorderly\u201d can possibly have been an object of\ndesign at all. This principle is of course a mere assumption in the\ninterests of anthropomorphic Theism.\nWhen one views the world with no definite theological bias one way\nor the other, one sees that order and disorder, as we now recognize\nthem, are purely human inventions. We are interested in certain\ntypes of arrangement, useful, \u00e6sthetic, or moral,\u2014so interested that\nwhenever we find them realized, the fact emphatically rivets our\nattention. The result is that we work over the contents of the world\nselectively. It is overflowing with disorderly arrangements from our\npoint of view, but order is the only thing we care for and look at,\nand by choosing, one can always find some sort of orderly\narrangement in the midst of any chaos. If I should throw down a\nthousand beans at random upon a table, I could doubtless, by\neliminating a sufficient number of them, leave the rest in almost\nany geometrical pattern you might propose to me, and you might then\nsay that that pattern was the thing prefigured beforehand, and that\nthe other beans were mere irrelevance and packing material. Our\ndealings with Nature are just like this. She is a vast _plenum_ in\nwhich our attention draws capricious lines in innumerable\ndirections. We count and name whatever lies upon the special lines\nwe trace, whilst the other things and the untraced lines are neither\nnamed nor counted. There are in reality infinitely more things\n\u2019unadapted\u2019 to each other in this world than there are things\n\u2019adapted\u2019; infinitely more things with irregular relations than with\nregular relations between them. But we look for the regular kind of\nthing exclusively, and ingeniously discover and preserve it in our\nmemory. It accumulates with other regular kinds, until the\ncollection of them fills our encyclop\u00e6dias. Yet all the while\nbetween and around them lies an infinite anonymous chaos of objects\nthat no one ever thought of together, of relations that never yet\nattracted our attention.\nThe facts of order from which the physico\u2010theological argument\nstarts are thus easily susceptible of interpretation as arbitrary\nhuman products. So long as this is the case, although of course no\nargument against God follows, it follows that the argument for him\nwill fail to constitute a knock\u2010down proof of his existence. It will\nbe convincing only to those who on other grounds believe in him\nalready.\n293 For the scholastics the _facultas appetendi_ embraces feeling,\ndesire, and will.\n294 Op. cit., Discourse III. \u00a7 7.\n295 In an article, How to make our Ideas Clear, in the Popular Science\nMonthly for January, 1878, vol. xii. p. 286.\n296 Pragmatically, the most important attribute of God is his punitive\njustice. But who, in the present state of theological opinion on\nthat point, will dare maintain that hell fire or its equivalent in\nsome shape is rendered certain by pure logic? Theology herself has\nlargely based this doctrine upon revelation; and, in discussing it,\nhas tended more and more to substitute conventional ideas of\ncriminal law for a priori principles of reason. But the very notion\nthat this glorious universe, with planets and winds, and laughing\nsky and ocean, should have been conceived and had its beams and\nrafters laid in technicalities of criminality, is incredible to our\nmodern imagination. It weakens a religion to hear it argued upon\nsuch a basis.\n297 John Caird: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion, London\nand New York, 1880, pp. 243\u2010250, and 291\u2010299, much abridged.\n298 A.

In\nthe present lectures, which are cast throughout in a popular mould,\nthere seemed no room for subtle metaphysical discussion, and for\ntactical purposes it was sufficient, the contention of philosophy\nbeing what it is (namely, that religion can be transformed into a\nuniversally convincing science), to point to the fact that no\nreligious philosophy has actually convinced the mass of thinkers.\nMeanwhile let me say that I hope that the present volume may be\nfollowed by another, if I am spared to write it, in which not only\nProfessor Royce\u2019s arguments, but others for monistic absolutism\nshall be considered with all the technical fullness which their\ngreat importance calls for. At present I resign myself to lying\npassive under the reproach of superficiality.\n299 Idea of a University, Discourse III. \u00a7 7.\n300 Newman\u2019s imagination so innately craved an ecclesiastical system\nthat he can write: \u201cFrom the age of fifteen, dogma has been the\nfundamental principle of my religion: I know no other religion; I\ncannot enter into the idea of any other sort of religion.\u201d And\nagain, speaking of himself about the age of thirty, he writes: \u201cI\nloved to act as feeling myself in my Bishop\u2019s sight, as if it were\nthe sight of God.\u201d Apologia, 1897, pp. 48, 50.\n301 The intellectual difference is quite on a par in practical\nimportance with the analogous difference in character. We saw, under\nthe head of Saintliness, how some characters resent confusion and\nmust live in purity, consistency, simplicity (above, p. 280 ff.).\nFor others, on the contrary, superabundance, over\u2010pressure,\nstimulation, lots of superficial relations, are indispensable. There\nare men who would suffer a very syncope if you should pay all their\ndebts, bring it about that their engagements had been kept, their\nletters answered, their perplexities relieved, and their duties\nfulfilled, down to one which lay on a clean table under their eyes\nwith nothing to interfere with its immediate performance. A day\nstripped so staringly bare would be for them appalling. So with\nease, elegance, tributes of affection, social recognitions\u2014some of\nus require amounts of these things which to others would appear a\nmass of lying and sophistication.\n302 In Newman\u2019s Lectures on Justification, Lecture VIII. \u00a7 6, there is a\nsplendid passage expressive of this \u00e6sthetic way of feeling the\nChristian scheme. It is unfortunately too long to quote.\n303 Compare the informality of Protestantism, where the \u201cmeek lover of\nthe good,\u201d alone with his God, visits the sick, etc., for their own\nsakes, with the elaborate \u201cbusiness\u201d that goes on in Catholic\ndevotion, and carries with it the social excitement of all more\ncomplex businesses. An essentially worldly\u2010minded Catholic woman can\nbecome a visitor of the sick on purely coquettish principles, with\nher confessor and director, her \u201cmerit\u201d storing up, her patron\nsaints, her privileged relation to the Almighty, drawing his\nattention as a professional _d\u00e9vote_, her definite \u201cexercises,\u201d and\nher definitely recognized social _pose_ in the organization.\n304 Above, p. 362 ff.\n305 A fuller discussion of confession is contained in the excellent work\nby FRANK GRANGER: The Soul of a Christian, London, 1900, ch. xii.\n306 Example: \u201cThe minister at Sudbury, being at the Thursday lecture in\nBoston, heard the officiating clergyman praying for rain. As soon as\nthe service was over, he went to the petitioner and said, \u2018You\nBoston ministers, as soon as a tulip wilts under your windows, go to\nchurch and pray for rain, until all Concord and Sudbury are under\nwater.\u2019 \u201d R.

Robert Lyde, an English sailor,\nalong with an English boy, being prisoners on a French ship in 1689,\nset upon the crew, of seven Frenchmen, killed two, made the other\nfive prisoners, and brought home the ship. Lyde thus describes how\nin this feat he found his God a very present help in time of\ntrouble:\u2014\n\u201cWith the assistance of God I kept my feet when they three and one\nmore did strive to throw me down. Feeling the Frenchman which hung\nabout my middle hang very heavy, I said to the boy, \u2018Go round the\nbinnacle, and knock down that man that hangeth on my back.\u2019 So the\nboy did strike him one blow on the head which made him fall.... Then\nI looked about for a marlin spike or anything else to strike them\nwithal. But seeing nothing, I said, \u2018LORD! what shall I do?\u2019 Then\ncasting up my eye upon my left side, and seeing a marlin spike\nhanging, I jerked my right arm and took hold, and struck the point\nfour times about a quarter of an inch deep into the skull of that\nman that had hold of my left arm. [One of the Frenchmen then hauled\nthe marlin spike away from him.] But through GOD\u2019S wonderful\nprovidence! it either fell out of his hand, or else he threw it\ndown, and at this time the Almighty GOD gave me strength enough to\ntake one man in one hand, and throw at the other\u2019s head: and looking\nabout again to see anything to strike them withal, but seeing\nnothing, I said, \u2018LORD! what shall I do now?\u2019 And then it pleased\nGOD to put me in mind of my knife in my pocket. And although two of\nthe men had hold of my right arm, yet GOD Almighty strengthened me\nso that I put my right hand into my right pocket, drew out the knife\nand sheath, ... put it between my legs and drew it out, and then cut\nthe man\u2019s throat with it that had his back to my breast: and he\nimmediately dropt down, and scarce ever stirred after.\u201d\u2014I have\nslightly abridged Lyde\u2019s narrative.\n314 As, for instance, In Answer to Prayer, by the BISHOP OF RIPON and\nothers, London, 1898; Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to\nPrayer, Harrisburg, Pa., 1898 (?); H.

These\nthings we ought forever to celebrate.... But because the most of you\nare blind and insensible, there must be some one to fill this\nstation, and lead, in behalf of all men, the hymn to God; for what\nelse can I do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God?

We must normally have such a feeling, he thinks, or\nthe _sense of an absence_ would not be so striking as it is in these\nexperiences. Graphic automatism of a fully developed kind is rare in\nreligious history, so far as my knowledge goes. Such statements as\nAntonia Bourignon\u2019s, that \u201cI do nothing but lend my hand and spirit\nto another power than mine,\u201d is shown by the context to indicate\ninspiration rather than directly automatic writing. In some\neccentric sects this latter occurs.

From an\nobliging letter written to me in 1899 by an eminent Mormon, I quote\nthe following extract:\u2014\n\u201cIt may be very interesting for you to know that the President [Mr.\nSnow] of the Mormon Church claims to have had a number of\nrevelations very recently from heaven. To explain fully what these\nrevelations are, it is necessary to know that we, as a people,\nbelieve that the Church of Jesus Christ has again been established\nthrough messengers sent from heaven. This Church has at its head a\nprophet, seer, and revelator, who gives to man God\u2019s holy will.\nRevelation is the means through which the will of God is declared\ndirectly and in fullness to man. These revelations are got through\ndreams of sleep or in waking visions of the mind, by voices without\nvisional appearance, or by actual manifestations of the Holy\nPresence before the eye. We believe that God has come in person and\nspoken to our prophet and revelator.\u201d\n328 For example, on pages 135, 163, 333, above.\n329 From this point of view, the contrasts between the healthy and the\nmorbid mind, and between the once\u2010born and the twice\u2010born types, of\nwhich I spoke in earlier lectures (see pp. 162\u2010167), cease to be the\nradical antagonisms which many think them. The twice\u2010born look down\nupon the rectilinear consciousness of life of the once\u2010born as being\n\u201cmere morality,\u201d and not properly religion. \u201cDr. Channing,\u201d an\northodox minister is reported to have said, \u201cis excluded from the\nhighest form of religious life by the extraordinary rectitude of his\ncharacter.\u201d It is indeed true that the outlook upon life of the\ntwice\u2010born\u2014holding as it does more of the element of evil in\nsolution\u2014is the wider and completer. The \u201cheroic\u201d or \u201csolemn\u201d way in\nwhich life comes to them is a \u201chigher synthesis\u201d into which healthy\u2010\nmindedness and morbidness both enter and combine. Evil is not\nevaded, but sublated in the higher religious cheer of these persons\n(see pp. 47\u201052, 362\u2010365). But the final consciousness which each\ntype reaches of union with the divine has the same practical\nsignificance for the individual; and individuals may well be allowed\nto get to it by the channels which lie most open to their several\ntemperaments. In the cases which were quoted in Lecture IV, of the\nmind\u2010cure form of healthy\u2010mindedness, we found abundant examples of\nregenerative process. The severity of the crisis in this process is\na matter of degree. How long one shall continue to drink the\nconsciousness of evil, and when one shall begin to short\u2010circuit and\nget rid of it, are also matters of amount and degree, so that in\nmany instances it is quite arbitrary whether we class the individual\nas a once\u2010born or a twice\u2010born subject.\n330 Compare, e.g., the quotation from Renan on p. 37, above.\n331 \u201cPrayerful\u201d taken in the broader sense explained above on pp. 463\nff.\n332 How was it ever conceivable, we ask, that a man like Christian\nWolff, in whose dry\u2010as\u2010dust head all the learning of the early\neighteenth century was concentrated, should have preserved such a\nbaby\u2010like faith in the personal and human character of Nature as to\nexpound her operations as he did in his work on the uses of natural\nthings? This, for example, is the account he gives of the sun and\nits utility:\u2014\n\u201cWe see that God has created the sun to keep the changeable\nconditions on the earth in such an order that living creatures, men\nand beasts, may inhabit its surface. Since men are the most\nreasonable of creatures, and able to infer God\u2019s invisible being\nfrom the contemplation of the world, the sun in so far forth\ncontributes to the primary purpose of creation: without it the race\nof man could not be preserved or continued.... The sun makes\ndaylight, not only on our earth, but also on the other planets; and\ndaylight is of the utmost utility to us; for by its means we can\ncommodiously carry on those occupations which in the night\u2010time\nwould either be quite impossible, or at any rate impossible without\nour going to the expense of artificial light. The beasts of the\nfield can find food by day which they would not be able to find at\nnight. Moreover we owe it to the sunlight that we are able to see\neverything that is on the earth\u2019s surface, not only near by, but\nalso at a distance, and to recognize both near and far things\naccording to their species, which again is of manifold use to us not\nonly in the business necessary to human life, and when we are\ntraveling, but also for the scientific knowledge of Nature, which\nknowledge for the most part depends on observations made with the\nhelp of sight, and, without the sunshine, would have been\nimpossible. If any one would rightly impress on his mind the great\nadvantages which he derives from the sun, let him imagine himself\nliving through only one month, and see how it would be with all his\nundertakings, if it were not day but night. He would then be\nsufficiently convinced out of his own experience, especially if he\nhad much work to carry on in the street or in the fields.... From\nthe sun we learn to recognize when it is midday, and by knowing this\npoint of time exactly, we can set our clocks right, on which account\nastronomy owes much to the sun.... By help of the sun one can find\nthe meridian.... But the meridian is the basis of our sun\u2010dials, and\ngenerally speaking, we should have no sun\u2010dials if we had no sun.\u201d\nVern\u00fcnftige Gedanken von den Absichten der nat\u00fcrlichen Dinge, 1782,\npp. 74\u201084.\nOr read the account of God\u2019s beneficence in the institution of \u201cthe\ngreat variety throughout the world of men\u2019s faces, voices, and\nhandwriting,\u201d given in Derham\u2019s Physico\u2010theology, a book that had\nmuch vogue in the eighteenth century. \u201cHad Man\u2019s body,\u201d says Dr.\nDerham, \u201cbeen made according to any of the Atheistical Schemes, or\nany other Method than that of the infinite Lord of the World, this\nwise Variety would never have been: but Men\u2019s Faces would have been\ncast in the same, or not a very different Mould, their Organs of\nSpeech would have sounded the same or not so great a Variety of\nNotes; and the same Structure of Muscles and Nerves would have given\nthe Hand the same Direction in Writing. And in this Case, what\nConfusion, what Disturbance, what Mischiefs would the world\neternally have lain under! No Security could have been to our\npersons; no Certainty, no Enjoyment of our Possessions; no Justice\nbetween Man and Man; no Distinction between Good and Bad, between\nFriends and Foes, between Father and Child, Husband and Wife, Male\nor Female; but all would have been turned topsy\u2010turvy, by being\nexposed to the Malice of the Envious and ill\u2010Natured, to the Fraud\nand Violence of Knaves and Robbers, to the Forgeries of the crafty\nCheat, to the Lusts of the Effeminate and Debauched, and what not!\nOur Courts of Justice can abundantly testify the dire Effects of\nMistaking Men\u2019s Faces, of counterfeiting their Hands, and forging\nWritings. But now as the infinitely wise Creator and Ruler hath\nordered the Matter, every man\u2019s Face can distinguish him in the\nLight, and his Voice in the Dark; his Hand\u2010writing can speak for him\nthough absent, and be his Witness, and secure his Contracts in\nfuture Generations. A manifest as well as admirable Indication of\nthe divine Superintendence and Management.\u201d\nA God so careful as to make provision even for the unmistakable\nsigning of bank checks and deeds was a deity truly after the heart\nof eighteenth century Anglicanism.\nI subjoin, omitting the capitals, Derham\u2019s \u201cVindication of God by\nthe Institution of Hills and Valleys,\u201d and Wolff\u2019s altogether\nculinary account of the institution of Water:\u2014\n\u201cThe uses,\u201d says Wolff, \u201cwhich water serves in human life are plain\nto see and need not be described at length. Water is a universal\ndrink of man and beasts. Even though men have made themselves drinks\nthat are artificial, they could not do this without water. Beer is\nbrewed of water and malt, and it is the water in it which quenches\nthirst. Wine is prepared from grapes, which could never have grown\nwithout the help of water; and the same is true of those drinks\nwhich in England and other places they produce from fruit....\nTherefore since God so planned the world that men and beasts should\nlive upon it and find there everything required for their necessity\nand convenience, he also made water as one means whereby to make the\nearth into so excellent a dwelling. And this is all the more\nmanifest when we consider the advantages which we obtain from this\nsame water for the cleaning of our household utensils, of our\nclothing, and of other matters.... When one goes into a grinding\u2010\nmill one sees that the grindstone must always be kept wet and then\none will get a still greater idea of the use of water.\u201d\nOf the hills and valleys, Derham, after praising their beauty,\ndiscourses as follows: \u201cSome constitutions are indeed of so happy a\nstrength, and so confirmed an health, as to be indifferent to almost\nany place or temperature of the air. But then others are so weakly\nand feeble, as not to be able to bear one, but can live comfortably\nin another place. With some the more subtle and finer air of the\nhills doth best agree, who are languishing and dying in the feculent\nand grosser air of great towns, or even the warmer and vaporous air\nof the valleys and waters. But contrariwise, others languish on the\nhills, and grow lusty and strong in the warmer air of the valleys.\n\u201cSo that this opportunity of shifting our abode from the hills to\nthe vales, is an admirable easement, refreshment, and great benefit\nto the valetudinarian, feeble part of mankind; affording those an\neasy and comfortable life, who would otherwise live miserably,\nlanguish, and pine away.\n\u201cTo this salutary conformation of the earth we may add another great\nconvenience of the hills, and that is affording commodious places\nfor habitation, serving (as an eminent author wordeth it) as screens\nto keep off the cold and nipping blasts of the northern and easterly\nwinds, and reflecting the benign and cherishing sunbeams, and so\nrendering our habitations both more comfortable and more cheerly in\nwinter.\n\u201cLastly, it is to the hills that the fountains owe their rise and\nthe rivers their conveyance, and consequently those vast masses and\nlofty piles are not, as they are charged, such rude and useless\nexcrescences of our ill\u2010formed globe; but the admirable tools of\nnature, contrived and ordered by the infinite Creator, to do one of\nits most useful works. For, was the surface of the earth even and\nlevel, and the middle parts of its islands and continents not\nmountainous and high as now it is, it is most certain there could be\nno descent for the rivers, no conveyance for the waters; but,\ninstead of gliding along those gentle declivities which the higher\nlands now afford them quite down to the sea, they would stagnate and\nperhaps stink, and also drown large tracts of land.\n\u201c[Thus] the hills and vales, though to a peevish and weary traveler\nthey may seem incommodious and troublesome, yet are a noble work of\nthe great Creator, and wisely appointed by him for the good of our\nsublunary world.\u201d\n333 Until the seventeenth century this mode of thought prevailed. One\nneed only recall the dramatic treatment even of mechanical questions\nby Aristotle, as, for example, his explanation of the power of the\nlever to make a small weight raise a larger one. This is due,\naccording to Aristotle, to the generally miraculous character of the\ncircle and of all circular movement. The circle is both convex and\nconcave; it is made by a fixed point and a moving line, which\ncontradict each other; and whatever moves in a circle moves in\nopposite directions. Nevertheless, movement in a circle is the most\n\u201cnatural\u201d movement; and the long arm of the lever, moving, as it\ndoes, in the larger circle, has the greater amount of this natural\nmotion, and consequently requires the lesser force. Or recall the\nexplanation by Herodotus of the position of the sun in winter: It\nmoves to the south because of the cold which drives it into the warm\nparts of the heavens over Libya. Or listen to Saint Augustine\u2019s\nspeculations: \u201cWho gave to chaff such power to freeze that it\npreserves snow buried under it, and such power to warm that it\nripens green fruit? Who can explain the strange properties of fire\nitself, which blackens all that it burns, though itself bright, and\nwhich, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost all\nthat it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy\ncinders?... Then what wonderful properties do we find in charcoal,\nwhich is so brittle that a light tap breaks it, and a slight\npressure pulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture rots\nit, nor any time causes it to decay.\u201d City of God, book xxi. ch. iv.\nSuch aspects of things as these, their naturalness and\nunnaturalness, the sympathies and antipathies of their superficial\nqualities, their eccentricities, their brightness and strength and\ndestructiveness, were inevitably the ways in which they originally\nfastened our attention.\nIf you open early medical books, you will find sympathetic magic\ninvoked on every page. Take, for example, the famous vulnerary\nointment attributed to Paracelsus. For this there were a variety of\nreceipts, including usually human fat, the fat of either a bull, a\nwild boar, or a bear; powdered earthworms, the _usnia_, or mossy\ngrowth on the weathered skull of a hanged criminal, and other\nmaterials equally unpleasant\u2014the whole prepared under the planet\nVenus if possible, but never under Mars or Saturn. Then, if a\nsplinter of wood, dipped in the patient\u2019s blood, or the bloodstained\nweapon that wounded him, be immersed in this ointment, the wound\nitself being tightly bound up, the latter infallibly gets well,\u2014I\nquote now Van Helmont\u2019s account,\u2014for the blood on the weapon or\nsplinter, containing in it the spirit of the wounded man, is roused\nto active excitement by the contact of the ointment, whence there\nresults to it a full commission or power to cure its cousin\u2010german,\nthe blood in the patient\u2019s body. This it does by sucking out the\ndolorous and exotic impression from the wounded part. But to do this\nit has to implore the aid of the bull\u2019s fat, and other portions of\nthe unguent. The reason why bull\u2019s fat is so powerful is that the\nbull at the time of slaughter is full of secret reluctancy and\nvindictive murmurs, and therefore dies with a higher flame of\nrevenge about him than any other animal. And thus we have made it\nout, says this author, that the admirable efficacy of the ointment\nought to be imputed, not to any auxiliary concurrence of Satan, but\nsimply to the energy of the _posthumous character of Revenge_\nremaining firmly impressed upon the blood and concreted fat in the\nunguent. J. B. VAN HELMONT: A Ternary of Paradoxes, translated by\nWALTER CHARLETON, London, 1650.\u2014I much abridge the original in my\ncitations.\nThe author goes on to prove by the analogy of many other natural\nfacts that this sympathetic action between things at a distance is\nthe true rationale of the case. \u201cIf,\u201d he says, \u201cthe heart of a\nhorse, slain by a witch, taken out of the yet reeking carcase, be\nimpaled upon an arrow and roasted, immediately the whole witch\nbecomes tormented with the insufferable pains and cruelty of the\nfire, which could by no means happen unless there preceded a\nconjunction of the spirit of the witch with the spirit of the horse.\nIn the reeking and yet panting heart, the spirit of the witch is\nkept captive, and the retreat of it prevented by the arrow\ntransfixed. Similarly hath not many a murdered carcase at the\ncoroner\u2019s inquest suffered a fresh h\u00e6morrhage or cruentation at the\npresence of the assassin?\u2014the blood being, as in a furious fit of\nanger, enraged and agitated by the impress of revenge conceived\nagainst the murderer, at the instant of the soul\u2019s compulsive exile\nfrom the body. So, if you have dropsy, gout, or jaundice, by\nincluding some of your warm blood in the shell and white of an egg,\nwhich, exposed to a gentle heat, and mixed with a bait of flesh, you\nshall give to a hungry dog or hog, the disease shall instantly pass\nfrom you into the animal, and leave you entirely. And similarly\nagain, if you burn some of the milk either of a cow or of a woman,\nthe gland from which it issued will dry up. A gentleman at Brussels\nhad his nose mowed off in a combat, but the celebrated surgeon\nTagliacozzus digged a new nose for him out of the skin of the arm of\na porter at Bologna. About thirteen months after his return to his\nown country, the engrafted nose grew cold, putrefied, and in a few\ndays dropped off, and it was then discovered that the porter had\nexpired, near about the same punctilio of time. There are still at\nBrussels eye\u2010witnesses of this occurrence,\u201d says Van Helmont; and\nadds, \u201cI pray what is there in this of superstition or of exalted\nimagination?\u201d\nModern mind\u2010cure literature\u2014the works of Prentice Mulford, for\nexample\u2014is full of sympathetic magic.\n334 Compare Lotze\u2019s doctrine that the only meaning we can attach to the\nnotion of a thing as it is \u201cin itself\u201d is by conceiving it as it is\n_for_ itself; i.e., as a piece of full experience with a private\nsense of \u201cpinch\u201d or inner activity of some sort going with it.\n335 Even the errors of fact may possibly turn out not to be as wholesale\nas the scientist assumes. We saw in Lecture IV how the religious\nconception of the universe seems to many mind\u2010curers \u2019verified\u2019 from\nday to day by their experience of fact. \u201cExperience of fact\u201d is a\nfield with so many things in it that the sectarian scientist,\nmethodically declining, as he does, to recognize such \u201cfacts\u201d as\nmind\u2010curers and others like them experience, otherwise than by such\nrude heads of classification as \u201cbosh,\u201d \u201crot,\u201d \u201cfolly,\u201d certainly\nleaves out a mass of raw fact which, save for the industrious\ninterest of the religious in the more personal aspects of reality,\nwould never have succeeded in getting itself recorded at all. We\nknow this to be true already in certain cases; it may, therefore, be\ntrue in others as well. Miraculous healings have always been part of\nthe supernaturalist stock in trade, and have always been dismissed\nby the scientist as figments of the imagination. But the scientist\u2019s\ntardy education in the facts of hypnotism has recently given him an\napperceiving mass for phenomena of this order, and he consequently\nnow allows that the healings may exist, provided you expressly call\nthem effects of \u201csuggestion.\u201d Even the stigmata of the cross on\nSaint Francis\u2019s hands and feet may on these terms not be a fable.\nSimilarly, the time\u2010honored phenomenon of diabolical possession is\non the point of being admitted by the scientist as a fact, now that\nhe has the name of \u201chystero\u2010demonopathy\u201d by which to apperceive it.\nNo one can foresee just how far this legitimation of occultist\nphenomena under newly found scientist titles may proceed\u2014even\n\u201cprophecy,\u201d even \u201clevitation,\u201d might creep into the pale.\nThus the divorce between scientist facts and religious facts may not\nnecessarily be as eternal as it at first sight seems, nor the\npersonalism and romanticism of the world, as they appeared to\nprimitive thinking, be matters so irrevocably outgrown. The final\nhuman opinion may, in short, in some manner now impossible to\nforesee, revert to the more personal style, just as any path of\nprogress may follow a spiral rather than a straight line. If this\nwere so, the rigorously impersonal view of science might one day\nappear as having been a temporarily useful eccentricity rather than\nthe definitively triumphant position which the sectarian scientist\nat present so confidently announces it to be.\n336 Hume\u2019s criticism has banished causation from the world of physical\nobjects, and \u201cScience\u201d is absolutely satisfied to define cause in\nterms of concomitant change\u2014read Mach, Pearson, Ostwald. The\n\u201coriginal\u201d of the notion of causation is in our inner personal\nexperience, and only there can causes in the old\u2010fashioned sense be\ndirectly observed and described.\n337 When I read in a religious paper words like these: \u201cPerhaps the best\nthing we can say of God is that he is _the Inevitable Inference_,\u201d I\nrecognize the tendency to let religion evaporate in intellectual\nterms. Would martyrs have sung in the flames for a mere inference,\nhowever inevitable it might be? Original religious men, like Saint\nFrancis, Luther, Behmen, have usually been enemies of the\nintellect\u2019s pretension to meddle with religious things. Yet the\nintellect, everywhere invasive, shows everywhere its shallowing\neffect. See how the ancient spirit of Methodism evaporates under\nthose wonderfully able rationalistic booklets (which every one\nshould read) of a philosopher like Professor Bowne (The Christian\nRevelation, The Christian Life, The Atonement: Cincinnati and New\nYork, 1898, 1899, 1900). See the positively expulsive purpose of\nphilosophy properly so called:\u2014\n\u201cReligion,\u201d writes M. Vacherot (La Religion, Paris, 1869, pp. 313,\n436, et passim), \u201canswers to a transient state or condition, not to\na permanent determination of human nature, being merely an\nexpression of that stage of the human mind which is dominated by the\nimagination.... Christianity has but a single possible final heir to\nits estate, and that is scientific philosophy.\u201d\nIn a still more radical vein, Professor Ribot (Psychologie des\nSentiments, p. 310) describes the evaporation of religion. He sums\nit up in a single formula\u2014the ever\u2010growing predominance of the\nrational intellectual element, with the gradual fading out of the\nemotional element, this latter tending to enter into the group of\npurely intellectual sentiments. \u201cOf religious sentiment properly so\ncalled, nothing survives at last save a vague respect for the\nunknowable _x_ which is a last relic of the fear, and a certain\nattraction towards the ideal, which is a relic of the love, that\ncharacterized the earlier periods of religious growth. To state this\nmore simply, _religion tends to turn into religious\nphilosophy_.\u2014These are psychologically entirely different things,\nthe one being a theoretic construction of ratiocination, whereas the\nother is the living work of a group of persons, or of a great\ninspired leader, calling into play the entire thinking and feeling\norganism of man.\u201d\nI find the same failure to recognize that the stronghold of religion\nlies in individuality in attempts like those of Professor Baldwin\n(Mental Development, Social and Ethical Interpretations, ch. x.) and\nMr. H. R. Marshall (Instinct and Reason, chaps, viii. to xii.) to\nmake it a purely \u201cconservative social force.\u201d\n338 Compare, for instance, pages 203, 219, 223, 226, 249 to 256, 275 to\n278.\n339 American Journal of Psychology, vii. 345.\n340 Above, p. 184.\n341 Above, p. 145.\n342 Above, p. 400.\n343 Example: Henri Perreyve writes to Gratry: \u201cI do not know how to deal\nwith the happiness which you aroused in me this morning. It\noverwhelms me; I want to _do_ something, yet I can do nothing and am\nfit for nothing.... I would fain do _great things_.\u201d Again, after an\ninspiring interview, he writes: \u201cI went homewards, intoxicated with\njoy, hope, and strength. I wanted to feed upon my happiness in\nsolitude, far from all men. It was late; but, unheeding that, I took\na mountain path and went on like a madman, looking at the heavens,\nregardless of earth. Suddenly an instinct made me draw hastily\nback\u2014I was on the very edge of a precipice, one step more and I must\nhave fallen. I took fright and gave up my nocturnal promenade.\u201d A.\nGRATRY: Henri Perreyve, London, 1872, pp. 92, 89.\nThis primacy, in the faith\u2010state, of vague expansive impulse over\ndirection is well expressed in Walt Whitman\u2019s lines (Leaves of\nGrass, 1872, p. 190):\u2014\n\u201cO to confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs,\nas the trees and animals do....\nDear Camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still\nurge you, without the least idea what is our destination,\nOr whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell\u2019d and defeated.\u201d\nThis readiness for great things, and this sense that the world by\nits importance, wonderfulness, etc., is apt for their production,\nwould seem to be the undifferentiated germ of all the higher faiths.\nTrust in our own dreams of ambition, or in our country\u2019s expansive\ndestinies, and faith in the providence of God, all have their source\nin that onrush of our sanguine impulses, and in that sense of the\nexceedingness of the possible over the real.\n344 Compare LEUBA: Loc. cit., pp. 346\u2010349.\n345 The Contents of Religious Consciousness, in The Monist, xi. 536,\nJuly, 1901.\n346 Loc. cit., pp. 571, 572, abridged. See, also, this writer\u2019s\nextraordinarily true criticism of the notion that religion primarily\nseeks to solve the intellectual mystery of the world. Compare what\nW. BENDER says (in his Wesen der Religion, Bonn, 1888, pp. 85, 38):\n\u201cNot the question about God, and not the inquiry into the origin and\npurpose of the world is religion, but the question about Man. All\nreligious views of life are anthropocentric.\u201d \u201cReligion is that\nactivity of the human impulse towards self\u2010preservation by means of\nwhich Man seeks to carry his essential vital purposes through\nagainst the adverse pressure of the world by raising himself freely\ntowards the world\u2019s ordering and governing powers when the limits of\nhis own strength are reached.\u201d The whole book is little more than a\ndevelopment of these words.\n347 Remember that for some men it arrives suddenly, for others\ngradually, whilst others again practically enjoy it all their life.\n348 The practical difficulties are: 1, to \u201crealize the reality\u201d of one\u2019s\nhigher part; 2, to identify one\u2019s self with it exclusively; and 3,\nto identify it with all the rest of ideal being.\n349 \u201cWhen mystical activity is at its height, we find consciousness\npossessed by the sense of a being at once _excessive_ and\n_identical_ with the self: great enough to be God; interior enough\nto be me. The \u2018objectivity\u2019 of it ought in that case to be called\n_excessivity_, rather, or exceedingness.\u201d R\u00c9C\u00c9JAC: Essai sur les\nfondements de la conscience mystique, 1897, p. 46.\n350 The word \u201ctruth\u201d is here taken to mean something additional to bare\nvalue for life, although the natural propensity of man is to believe\nthat whatever has great value for life is thereby certified as true.\n351 Above, p. 455.\n352 Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, vol. vii. p. 305.\nFor a full statement of Mr. Myers\u2019s views, I may refer to his\nposthumous work, \u201cHuman Personality in the Light of Recent\nResearch,\u201d which is already announced by Messrs. Longmans, Green &\nCo. as being in press. Mr. Myers for the first time proposed as a\ngeneral psychological problem the exploration of the subliminal\nregion of consciousness throughout its whole extent, and made the\nfirst methodical steps in its topography by treating as a natural\nseries a mass of subliminal facts hitherto considered only as\ncurious isolated facts, and subjecting them to a systematized\nnomenclature. How important this exploration will prove, future work\nupon the path which Myers has opened can alone show. Compare my\npaper: \u201cFrederic Myers\u2019s Services to Psychology,\u201d in the said\nProceedings, part xlii., May, 1901.\n353 Compare the inventory given above on pp. 483\u20104, and also what is\nsaid of the subconscious self on pp. 233\u2010236, 240\u2010242.\n354 Compare above, pp. 419 ff.\n355 One more expression of this belief, to increase the reader\u2019s\nfamiliarity with the notion of it:\u2014\n\u201cIf this room is full of darkness for thousands of years, and you\ncome in and begin to weep and wail, \u2018Oh, the darkness,\u2019 will the\ndarkness vanish? Bring the light in, strike a match, and light comes\nin a moment. So what good will it do you to think all your lives,\n\u2018Oh, I have done evil, I have made many mistakes\u2019? It requires no\nghost to tell us that. Bring in the light, and the evil goes in a\nmoment. Strengthen the real nature, build up yourselves, the\neffulgent, the resplendent, the ever pure, call that up in every one\nwhom you see. I wish that every one of us had come to such a state\nthat even when we see the vilest of human beings we can see the God\nwithin, and instead of condemning, say, \u2018Rise, thou effulgent One,\nrise thou who art always pure, rise thou birthless and deathless,\nrise almighty, and manifest your nature.\u2019 ... This is the highest\nprayer that the Advaita teaches. This is the one prayer: remembering\nour nature.\u201d ... \u201cWhy does man go out to look for a God?... It is\nyour own heart beating, and you did not know, you were mistaking it\nfor something external. He, nearest of the near, my own self, the\nreality of my own life, my body and my soul.\u2014I am Thee and Thou art\nMe. That is your own nature. Assert it, manifest it. Not to become\npure, you are pure already. You are not to be perfect, you are that\nalready. Every good thought which you think or act upon is simply\ntearing the veil, as it were, and the purity, the Infinity, the God\nbehind, manifests itself\u2014the eternal Subject of everything, the\neternal Witness in this universe, your own Self. Knowledge is, as it\nwere, a lower step, a degradation. We are It already; how to know\nIt?\u201d SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: Addresses, No. XII., Practical Vedanta, part\niv. pp. 172, 174, London, 1897; and Lectures, The Real and the\nApparent Man, p. 24, abridged.\n356 For instance, here is a case where a person exposed from her birth\nto Christian ideas had to wait till they came to her clad in\nspiritistic formulas before the saving experience set in:\u2014\n\u201cFor myself I can say that spiritualism has saved me. It was\nrevealed to me at a critical moment of my life, and without it I\ndon\u2019t know what I should have done. It has taught me to detach\nmyself from worldly things and to place my hope in things to come.\nThrough it I have learned to see in all men, even in those most\ncriminal, even in those from whom I have most suffered, undeveloped\nbrothers to whom I owed assistance, love, and forgiveness. I have\nlearned that I must lose my temper over nothing, despise no one, and\npray for all. Most of all I have learned to pray! And although I\nhave still much to learn in this domain, prayer ever brings me more\nstrength, consolation, and comfort. I feel more than ever that I\nhave only made a few steps on the long road of progress; but I look\nat its length without dismay, for I have confidence that the day\nwill come when all my efforts shall be rewarded. So Spiritualism has\na great place in my life, indeed it holds the first place there.\u201d\nFlournoy Collection.\n357 \u201cThe influence of the Holy Spirit, exquisitely called the Comforter,\nis a matter of actual experience, as solid a reality as that of\nelectro\u2010magnetism.\u201d W. C. BROWNELL, Scribner\u2019s Magazine, vol. xxx.\np. 112.\n358 That the transaction of opening ourselves, otherwise called prayer,\nis a perfectly definite one for certain persons, appears abundantly\nin the preceding lectures. I append another concrete example to\nreinforce the impression on the reader\u2019s mind:\u2014\n\u201cMan can learn to transcend these limitations [of finite thought]\nand draw power and wisdom at will.... The divine presence is known\nthrough experience. The turning to a higher plane is a distinct act\nof consciousness. It is not a vague, twilight or semi\u2010conscious\nexperience. It is not an ecstasy; it is not a trance. It is not\nsuper\u2010consciousness in the Vedantic sense. It is not due to self\u2010\nhypnotization. It is a perfectly calm, sane, sound, rational,\ncommon\u2010sense shifting of consciousness from the phenomena of sense\u2010\nperception to the phenomena of seership, from the thought of self to\na distinctively higher realm.... For example, if the lower self be\nnervous, anxious, tense, one can in a few moments compel it to be\ncalm. This is not done by a word simply. Again I say, it is not\nhypnotism. It is by the exercise of power. One feels the spirit of\npeace as definitely as heat is perceived on a hot summer day. The\npower can be as surely used as the sun\u2019s rays can be focused and\nmade to do work, to set fire to wood.\u201d The Higher Law, vol. iv. pp.\n4, 6, Boston, August, 1901.\n359 Transcendentalists are fond of the term \u201cOver\u2010soul,\u201d but as a rule\nthey use it in an intellectualist sense, as meaning only a medium of\ncommunion. \u201cGod\u201d is a causal agent as well as a medium of communion,\nand that is the aspect which I wish to emphasize.\n360 Transcendental idealism, of course, insists that its ideal world\nmakes _this_ difference, that facts _exist_. We owe it to the\nAbsolute that we have a world of fact at all. \u201cA world\u201d of\nfact!\u2014that exactly is the trouble. An entire world is the smallest\nunit with which the Absolute can work, whereas to our finite minds\nwork for the better ought to be done within this world, setting in\nat single points. Our difficulties and our ideals are all piecemeal\naffairs, but the Absolute can do no piecework for us; so that all\nthe interests which our poor souls compass raise their heads too\nlate. We should have spoken earlier, prayed for another world\nabsolutely, before this world was born. It is strange, I have heard\na friend say, to see this blind corner into which Christian thought\nhas worked itself at last, with its God who can raise no particular\nweight whatever, who can help us with no private burden, and who is\non the side of our enemies as much as he is on our own. Odd\nevolution from the God of David\u2019s psalms!\n361 See my Will to Believe and other Essays in Popular Philosophy, 1897,\np. 165.\n362 Such a notion is suggested in my Ingersoll Lecture On Human\nImmortality, Boston and London, 1899.\n363 Tertium Quid, 1887, p. 99.

{"text": "THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY\nBY\nWILLIAM JAMES\nPROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY\nIN TWO VOLUMES\nVOL. I\nNEW YORK\nHENRY HOLT AND COMPANY\n1918\nTO\nMY DEAR FRIEND\nFRAN\u00c7OIS PILLON.\nAS A TOKEN OF AFFECTION,\nAND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WHAT I OWE\nTO THE\nCRITIQUE PHILOSOPHIQUE.\nPREFACE.\nThe treatise which follows has in the main grown up in connection with\nthe author's class-room instruction in Psychology, although it is true\nthat some of the chapters are more 'metaphysical,' and others fuller of\ndetail, than is suitable for students who are going over the subject\nfor the first time. The consequence of this is that, in spite of the\nexclusion of the important subjects of pleasure and pain, and moral and\n\u00e6sthetic feelings and judgments, the work has grown to a length which\nno one can regret more than the writer himself. The man must indeed be\nsanguine who, in this crowded age, can hope to have many readers for\nfourteen hundred continuous pages from his pen. But _wer Vieles bringt\nwird Manchem etwas bringen_; and, by judiciously skipping according to\ntheir several needs, I am sure that many sorts of readers, even those\nwho are just beginning the study of the subject, will find my book of\nuse. Since the beginners are most in need of guidance, I suggest for\ntheir behoof that they omit altogether on a first reading chapters 6,\n7, 8, 10 (from page 330 to page 371), 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21, and 28.\nThe better to awaken the neophyte's interest, it is possible that the\nwise order would be to pass directly from chapter 4 to chapters 23, 24,\n25, and 26, and thence to return to the first volume again. Chapter\n20, on Space-perception, is a terrible thing, which, unless written\nwith all that detail, could not be fairly treated at all. An abridgment\nof it, called 'The Spatial Quale,' which appeared in the Journal of\nSpeculative Philosophy, vol. xiii, p. 64, may be found by some persons\na useful substitute for the entire chapter.\nI have kept close to the point of view of natural science throughout\nthe book. Every natural science assumes certain data uncritically, and\ndeclines to challenge the elements between which its own 'laws' obtain,\nand from which its own deductions are carried on. Psychology, the\nscience of finite individual minds, assumes as its data (1) _thoughts\nand feelings_, and (2) _a physical world_ in time and space with which\nthey coexist and which (3) _they know_. Of course these data themselves\nare discussable; but the discussion of them (as of other elements) is\ncalled metaphysics and falls outside the province of this book. This\nbook, assuming that thoughts and feelings exist and are vehicles of\nknowledge, thereupon contends that psychology when she has ascertained\nthe empirical correlation of the various sorts of thought or feeling\nwith definite conditions of the brain, can go no farther--can go\nno farther, that is, as a natural science. If she goes farther she\nbecomes metaphysical. All attempts to _explain_ our phenomenally given\nthoughts as products of deeper-lying entities (whether the latter be\nnamed 'Soul,' 'Transcendental Ego,' 'Ideas,' or 'Elementary Units\nof Consciousness') are metaphysical. This book consequently rejects\nboth the associationist and the spiritualist theories; and in this\nstrictly positivistic point of view consists the only feature of it\nfor which I feel tempted to claim originality. Of course this point of\nview is anything but ultimate. Men must keep thinking; and the data\nassumed by psychology, just like those assumed by physics and the other\nnatural sciences, must some time be overhauled. The effort to overhaul\nthem clearly and thoroughly is metaphysics; but metaphysics can only\nperform her task well when distinctly conscious of its great extent.\nMetaphysics fragmentary, irresponsible, and half-awake, and unconscious\nthat she is metaphysical, spoils two good things when she injects\nherself into a natural science. And it seems to me that the theories\nboth of a spiritual agent and of associated 'ideas' are, as they figure\nin the psychology-books, just such metaphysics as this. Even if their\nresults be true, it would be as well to keep them, _as thus presented_,\nout of psychology as it is to keep the results of idealism out of\nphysics.\nI have therefore treated our passing thoughts as integers, and\nregarded the mere laws of their coexistence with brain-states as the\nultimate laws for our science. The reader will in vain seek for any\nclosed system in the book. It is mainly a mass of descriptive details,\nrunning out into queries which only a metaphysics alive to the weight\nof her task can hope successfully to deal with. That will perhaps be\ncenturies hence; and meanwhile the best mark of health that a science\ncan show is this unfinished-seeming front.\nThe completion of the book has been so slow that several chapters\nhave been published successively in Mind, the Journal of Speculative\nPhilosophy, the Popular Science Monthly, and Scribner's Magazine.\nAcknowledgment is made in the proper places.\nThe bibliography, I regret to say, is quite unsystematic. I have\nhabitually given my authority for special experimental facts; but\nbeyond that I have aimed mainly to cite books that would probably\nbe actually used by the ordinary American college-student in his\ncollateral reading. The bibliography in W. Volkmann von Volkmar's\nLehrbuch der Psychologie (1875) is so complete, up to its date,\nthat there is no need of an inferior duplicate. And for more recent\nreferences, Sully's Outlines, Dewey's Psychology, and Baldwin's\nHandbook of Psychology may be advantageously used.\nFinally, where one owes to so many, it seems absurd to single out\nparticular creditors; yet I cannot resist the temptation at the end of\nmy first literary venture to record my gratitude for the inspiration I\nhave got from the writings of J. S. Mill, Lotze, Renouvier, Hodgson,\nand Wundt, and from the intellectual companionship (to name only five\nnames) of Chauncey Wright and Charles Peirce in old times, and more\nrecently of Stanley Hall, James Putnam, and Josiah Royce.\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY, August 1890.\nCONTENTS.\nCHAPTER I.\nTHE SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY,\nMental Manifestations depend on Cerebral Conditions, 1.

The phenomena are such things as we call\nfeelings, desires, cognitions, reasonings, decisions, and the like;\nand, superficially considered, their variety and complexity is such as\nto leave a chaotic impression on the observer. The most natural and\nconsequently the earliest way of unifying the material was, first,\nto classify it as well as might be, and, secondly, to affiliate the\ndiverse mental modes thus found, upon a simple entity, the personal\nSoul, of which they are taken to be so many facultative manifestations.\nNow, for instance, the Soul manifests its faculty of Memory, now of\nReasoning, now of Volition, or again its Imagination or its Appetite.\nThis is the orthodox 'spiritualistic' theory of scholasticism and of\ncommon-sense. Another and a less obvious way of unifying the chaos is\nto seek common elements in the divers mental facts rather than a common\nagent behind them, and to explain them constructively by the various\nforms of arrangement of these elements, as one explains houses by\nstones and bricks. The 'associationist' schools of Herbart in Germany,\nand of Hume the Mills and Bain in Britain have thus constructed a\n_psychology without a soul_ by taking discrete 'ideas,' faint or\nvivid, and showing how, by their cohesions, repulsions, and forms\nof succession, such things as reminiscences, perceptions, emotions,\nvolitions, passions, theories, and all the other furnishings of an\nindividual's mind may be engendered. The very Self or _ego_ of the\nindividual comes in this way to be viewed no longer as the pre-existing\nsource of the representations, but rather as their last and most\ncomplicated fruit.\nNow, if we strive rigorously to simplify the phenomena in either of\nthese ways, we soon become aware of inadequacies in our method. Any\nparticular cognition, for example, or recollection, is accounted for\non the soul-theory by being referred to the spiritual faculties of\nCognition or of Memory. These faculties themselves are thought of as\nabsolute properties of the soul; that is, to take the case of memory,\nno reason is given why we should remember a fact as it happened, except\nthat so to remember it constitutes the essence of our Recollective\nPower. We may, as spiritualists, try to explain our memory's failures\nand blunders by secondary causes. But its _successes_ can invoke no\nfactors save the existence of certain objective things to be remembered\non the one hand, and of our faculty of memory on the other. When,\nfor instance, I recall my graduation-day, and drag all its incidents\nand emotions up from death's dateless night, no mechanical cause can\nexplain this process, nor can any analysis reduce it to lower terms or\nmake its nature seem other than an ultimate _datum_, which, whether we\nrebel or not at its mysteriousness, must simply be taken for granted if\nwe are to psychologize at all. However the associationist may represent\nthe present ideas as thronging and arranging themselves, still, the\nspiritualist insists, he has in the end to admit that _something_,\nbe it brain, be it 'ideas,' be it 'association,' _knows_ past time\n_as_ past, and fills it out with this or that event. And when the\nspiritualist calls memory an 'irreducible faculty,' he says no more\nthan this admission of the associationist already grants.\nAnd yet the admission is far from being a satisfactory simplification\nof the concrete facts. For why should this absolute god-given Faculty\nretain so much better the events of yesterday than those of last\nyear, and, best of all, those of an hour ago? Why, again, in old\nage should its grasp of childhood's events seem firmest? Why should\nillness and exhaustion enfeeble it? Why should repeating an experience\nstrengthen our recollection of it? Why should drugs, fevers, asphyxia,\nand excitement resuscitate things long since forgotten? If we content\nourselves with merely affirming that the faculty of memory is so\npeculiarly constituted by nature as to exhibit just these oddities,\nwe seem little the better for having invoked it, for our explanation\nbecomes as complicated as that of the crude facts with which we\nstarted. Moreover there is something grotesque and irrational in the\nsupposition that the soul is equipped with elementary powers of such an\ningeniously intricate sort. Why _should_ our memory cling more easily\nto the near than the remote? Why should it lose its grasp of proper\nsooner than of abstract names? Such peculiarities seem quite fantastic;\nand might, for aught we can see _a priori_, be the precise opposites of\nwhat they are. Evidently, then, _the faculty does not exist absolutely,\nbut works under conditions_; and _the quest of the conditions_ becomes\nthe psychologist's most interesting task.\nHowever firmly he may hold to the soul and her remembering faculty, he\nmust acknowledge that she never exerts the latter without a _cue_, and\nthat something must always precede and _remind_ us of whatever we are\nto recollect. \"An _idea_,\" says the associationist, \"an idea associated\nwith the remembered thing; and this explains also why things repeatedly\nmet with are more easily recollected, for their associates on the\nvarious occasions furnish so many distinct avenues of recall.\" But this\ndoes not explain the effects of fever, exhaustion, hypnotism, old age,\nand the like. And in general, the pure associationist's account of our\nmental life is almost as bewildering as that of the pure spiritualist.\nThis multitude of ideas, existing absolutely, yet clinging together,\nand weaving an endless carpet of themselves, like dominoes in ceaseless\nchange, or the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope,--whence do they get\ntheir fantastic laws of clinging, and why do they cling in just the\nshapes they do?\nFor this the associationist must introduce the order of experience in\nthe outer world. The dance of the ideas is a copy, somewhat mutilated\nand altered, of the order of phenomena. But the slightest reflection\nshows that phenomena have absolutely no power to influence our ideas\nuntil they have first impressed our senses and our brain. The bare\nexistence of a past fact is no ground for our remembering it. Unless\nwe have seen it, or somehow _undergone_ it, we shall never know of its\nhaving been. The expediences of the body are thus one of the conditions\nof the faculty of memory being what it is. And a very small amount\nof reflection on facts shows that one part of the body, namely, the\nbrain, is the part whose experiences are directly concerned. If the\nnervous communication be cut off between the brain and other parts,\nthe experiences of those other parts are non-existent for the mind.\nThe eye is blind, the ear deaf, the hand insensible and motionless.\nAnd conversely, if the brain be injured, consciousness is abolished or\naltered, even although every other organ in the body be ready to play\nits normal part. A blow on the head, a sudden subtraction of blood, the\npressure of an apoplectic hemorrhage, may have the first effect; whilst\na very few ounces of alcohol or grains of opium or hasheesh, or a whiff\nof chloroform or nitrous oxide gas, are sure to have the second. The\ndelirium of fever, the altered self of insanity, are all due to foreign\nmatters circulating through the brain, or to pathological changes in\nthat organ's substance. The fact that the brain is the one immediate\nbodily condition of the mental operations is indeed so universally\nadmitted nowadays that I need spend no more time in illustrating it,\nbut will simply postulate it and pass on. The whole remainder of the\nbook will be more or less of a proof that the postulate was correct.\nBodily experiences, therefore, and more particularly brain-experiences,\nmust take a place amongst those conditions of the mental life of which\nPsychology need take account. _The spiritualist and the associationist\nmust both be 'cerebralists'_, to the extent at least of admitting that\ncertain peculiarities in the way of working of their own favorite\nprinciples are explicable only by the fact that the brain laws are a\ncodeterminant of the result. Our first conclusion, then, is that a\ncertain amount of brain-physiology must be presupposed or included in\nPsychology.[1]\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn still another way the psychologist is forced to be something of a\nnerve-physiologist. Mental phenomena are not only conditioned _a parte\nante_ by bodily processes; but they lead to them _a parte post_. That\nthey lead to _acts_ is of course the most familiar of truths, but I do\nnot merely mean acts in the sense of voluntary and deliberate muscular\nperformances. Mental states occasion also changes in the calibre of\nblood-vessels, or alteration in the heart-beats, or processes more\nsubtle still, in glands and viscera. If these are taken into account,\nas well as acts which follow at some _remote period_ because the mental\nstate was once there, it will be safe to lay down the general law\nthat _no mental modification ever occurs which is not accompanied or\nfollowed by a bodily change_. The ideas and feelings, _e.g_., which\nthese present printed characters excite in the reader's mind not only\noccasion movements of his eyes and nascent movements of articulation in\nhim, but will some day make him speak, or take sides in a discussion,\nor give advice, or choose a book to read, differently from what would\nhave been the case had they never impressed his retina. Our psychology\nmust therefore take account not only of the conditions antecedent to\nmental states, but of their resultant consequences as well.\n*       *       *       *       *\nBut actions originally prompted by conscious intelligence may grow\nso automatic by dint of habit as to be apparently unconsciously\nperformed. Standing, walking, buttoning and unbuttoning, piano-playing,\ntalking, even saying one's prayers, may be done when the mind is\nabsorbed in other things. The performances of animal _instinct_ seem\nsemi-automatic, and the _reflex acts_ of self-preservation certainly\nare so. Yet they resemble intelligent acts in bringing about the\n_same ends_ at which the animals' consciousness, on other occasions,\ndeliberately aims. Shall the study of such machine-like yet purposive\nacts as these be included in Psychology?\nThe boundary-line of the mental is certainly vague. It is better not\nto be pedantic, but to let the science be as vague as its subject,\nand include such phenomena as these if by so doing we can throw any\nlight on the main business in hand. It will ere long be seen, I trust,\nthat we can; and that we gain much more by a broad than by a narrow\nconception of our subject. At a certain stage in the development\nof every science a degree of vagueness is what best consists with\nfertility. On the whole, few recent formulas have done more real\nservice of a rough sort in psychology than the Spencerian one that\nthe essence of mental life and of bodily life are one, namely, 'the\nadjustment of inner to outer relations.' Such a formula is vagueness\nincarnate; but because it takes into account the fact that minds\ninhabit environments which act on them and on which they in turn\nreact; because, in short, it takes mind in the midst of all its\nconcrete relations, it is immensely more fertile than the old-fashioned\n'rational psychology,' which treated the soul as a detached existent,\nsufficient unto itself, and assumed to consider only its nature and\nproperties. I shall therefore feel free to make any sallies into\nzoology or into pure nerve-physiology which may seem instructive\nfor our purposes, but otherwise shall leave those sciences to the\nphysiologists.\n*       *       *       *       *\nCan we state more distinctly still the manner in which the mental life\nseems to intervene between impressions made from without upon the body,\nand reactions of the body upon the outer world again? Let us look at a\nfew facts.\nIf some iron filings be sprinkled on a table and a magnet brought near\nthem, they will fly through the air for a certain distance and stick\nto its surface. A savage seeing the phenomenon explains it as the\nresult of an attraction or love between the magnet and the filings.\nBut let a card cover the poles of the magnet, and the filings will\npress forever against its surface without its ever occurring to them\nto pass around its sides and thus come into more direct contact with\nthe object of their love. Blow bubbles through a tube into the bottom\nof a pail of water, they will rise to the surface and mingle with the\nair. Their action may again be poetically interpreted as due to a\nlonging to recombine with the mother-atmosphere above the surface. But\nif you invert a jar full of water over the pail, they will rise and\nremain lodged beneath its bottom, shut in from the outer air, although\na slight deflection from their course at the outset, or a re-descent\ntowards the rim of the jar when they found their upward course impeded,\nwould easily have set them free.\nIf now we pass from such actions as these to those of living things,\nwe notice a striking difference. Romeo wants Juliet as the filings\nwant the magnet; and if no obstacles intervene he moves towards her by\nas straight a line as they. But Romeo and Juliet, if a wall be built\nbetween them, do not remain idiotically pressing their faces against\nits opposite sides like the magnet and the filings with the card. Romeo\nsoon finds a circuitous way, by scaling the wall or otherwise, of\ntouching Juliet's lips directly. With the filings the path is fixed;\nwhether it reaches the end depends on accidents. With the lover it is\nthe end which is fixed, the path may be modified indefinitely.\nSuppose a living frog in the position in which we placed our bubbles\nof air, namely, at the bottom of a jar of water. The want of breath\nwill soon make him also long to rejoin the mother-atmosphere, and he\nwill take the shortest path to his end by swimming straight upwards.\nBut if a jar full of water be inverted over him, he will not, like the\nbubbles, perpetually press his nose against its unyielding roof, but\nwill restlessly explore the neighborhood until by re-descending again\nhe has discovered a path round its brim to the goal of his desires.\nAgain the fixed end, the varying means!\nSuch contrasts between living and inanimate performances end by leading\nmen to deny that in the physical world final purposes exist at all.\nLoves and desires are to-day no longer imputed to particles of iron or\nof air. No one supposes now that the end of any activity which they\nmay display is an ideal purpose presiding over the activity from its\noutset and soliciting or drawing it into being by a sort of _vis a\nfronte_. The end, on the contrary, is deemed a mere passive result,\npushed into being _a tergo_, having had, so to speak, no voice in its\nown production. Alter the pre-existing conditions, and with inorganic\nmaterials you bring forth each time a different apparent end. But\nwith intelligent agents, altering the conditions changes the activity\ndisplayed, but not the end reached; for here the idea of the yet\nunrealized end co-operates with the conditions to determine what the\nactivities shall be.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_The pursuance of future ends and the choice of means for their\nattainment are thus the mark and criterion of the presence of\nmentality_ in a phenomenon. We all use this test to discriminate\nbetween an intelligent and a mechanical performance. We impute no\nmentality to sticks and stones, because they never seem to move for\n_the sake of_ anything, but always when pushed, and then indifferently\nand with no sign of choice. So we unhesitatingly call them senseless.\nJust so we form our decision upon the deepest of all philosophic\nproblems: Is the Kosmos an expression of intelligence rational in its\ninward nature, or a brute external fact pure and simple? If we find\nourselves, in contemplating it, unable to banish the impression that it\nis a realm of final purposes, that it exists for the sake of something,\nwe place intelligence at the heart of it and have a religion. If,\non the contrary, in surveying its irremediable flux, we can think\nof the present only as so much mere mechanical sprouting from the\npast, occurring with no reference to the future, we are atheists and\nmaterialists.\nIn the lengthy discussions which psychologists have carried on about\nthe amount of intelligence displayed by lower mammals, or the amount\nof consciousness involved in the functions of the nerve-centres of\nreptiles, the same test has always been applied: Is the character of\nthe actions such that we must believe them to be performed _for the\nsake_ of their result? The result in question, as we shall hereafter\nabundantly see, is as a rule a useful one,--the animal is, on the\nwhole, safer under the circumstances for bringing it forth. So far\nthe action has a teleological character; but such mere outward\nteleology as this might still be the blind result of _vis a tergo_.\nThe growth and movements of plants, the processes of development,\ndigestion, secretion, etc., in animals, supply innumerable instances\nof performances useful to the individual which may nevertheless be,\nand by most of us are supposed to be, produced by automatic mechanism.\nThe physiologist does not confidently assert conscious intelligence\nin the frog's spinal cord until he has shown that the useful result\nwhich the nervous machinery brings forth under a given irritation\n_remains the same when the machinery is altered_. If, to take the stock\ninstance, the right knee of a headless frog be irritated with acid, the\nright foot will wipe it off. When, however, this foot is amputated,\nthe animal will often raise the _left_ foot to the spot and wipe the\noffending material away.\nPfl\u00fcger and Lewes reason from such facts in the following way: If the\nfirst reaction were the result of mere machinery, they say; if that\nirritated portion of the skin discharged the right leg as a trigger\ndischarges its own barrel of a shot-gun; then amputating the right\nfoot would indeed frustrate the wiping, but would not make the _left_\nleg move. It would simply result in the right stump moving through\nthe empty air (which is in fact the phenomenon sometimes observed).\nThe right trigger makes no effort to discharge the left barrel if the\nright one be unloaded; nor does an electrical machine ever get restless\nbecause it can only emit sparks, and not hem pillow-cases like a\nsewing-machine.\nIf, on the contrary, the right leg originally moved for the _purpose_\nof wiping the acid, then nothing is more natural than that, when the\neasiest means of effecting that purpose prove fruitless, other means\nshould be tried. Every failure must keep the animal in a state of\ndisappointment which will lead to all sorts of new trials and devices;\nand tranquillity will not ensue till one of these, by a happy stroke,\nachieves the wished-for end.\nIn a similar way Goltz ascribes intelligence to the frog's optic\nlobes and cerebellum. We alluded above to the manner in which a sound\nfrog imprisoned in water will discover an outlet to the atmosphere.\nGoltz found that frogs deprived of their cerebral hemispheres would\noften exhibit a like ingenuity. Such a frog, after rising from the\nbottom and finding his farther upward progress checked by the glass\nbell which has been inverted over him, will not persist in butting\nhis nose against the obstacle until dead of suffocation, but will\noften re-descend and emerge from under its rim as if, not a definite\nmechanical propulsion upwards, but rather a conscious desire to reach\nthe air by hook or crook were the main-spring of his activity. Goltz\nconcluded from this that the hemispheres are not the sole seal of\nintellect in frogs. He made the same inference from observing that a\nbrainless frog will turn over from his back to his belly when one of\nhis legs is sewed up, although the movements required are then very\ndifferent from those excited under normal circumstances by the same\nannoying position. They seem determined, consequently, not merely by\nthe antecedent irritant, but by the final end,--though the irritant of\ncourse is what makes the end desired.\nAnother brilliant German author, Liebmann,[2] argues against the\nbrain's mechanism accounting for mental action, by very similar\nconsiderations. A machine as such, he says, will bring forth right\nresults when it is in good order, and wrong results if out of repair.\nBut both kinds of result flow with equally fatal necessity from their\nconditions. We cannot suppose the clock-work whose structure fatally\ndetermines it to a certain rate of speed, noticing that this speed is\ntoo slow or too fast and vainly trying to correct it. Its conscience,\nif it have any, should be as good as that of the best chronometer, for\nboth alike obey equally well the same eternal mechanical laws--laws\nfrom behind. But if the _brain_ be out of order and the man says \"Twice\nfour are two,\" instead of \"Twice four are eight,\" or else \"I must go to\nthe coal to buy the wharf,\" instead of \"I must go to the wharf to buy\nthe coal,\" instantly there arises a consciousness of error. The wrong\nperformance, though it obey the same mechanical law as the right, is\nnevertheless condemned,--condemned as contradicting the inner law--the\nlaw from in front, the purpose or ideal for which the brain _should_\nact, whether it do so or not.\nWe need not discuss here whether these writers in drawing their\nconclusion have done justice to all the premises I involved in the\ncases they treat of. We quote their arguments only to show how they\nappeal to the principle that _no actions but such as are done for an\nend, and show a choice of means, can be called indubitable expressions\nof Mind_.\nI shall then adopt this as the criterion by which to circumscribe the\nsubject-matter of this work so far as action enters into it. Many\nnervous performances will therefore be unmentioned, as being purely\nphysiological. Nor will the anatomy of the nervous system and organs of\nsense be described anew. The reader will find in H. N. Martin's 'Human\nBody,' in G. T. Ladd's 'Physiological Psychology,' and in all the other\nstandard Anatomies and Physiologies, a mass of information which we\nmust regard as preliminary and take for granted in the present work.[3]\nOf the functions of the cerebral hemispheres, however, since they\ndirectly subserve consciousness, it will be well to give some little\naccount.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[1] _Cf._ Geo. T. Ladd: Elements of Physiological Psychology (1887),\npt. iii, chap. iii, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12.\n[2] Zur Analysis der Wirklichkeit, p. 489.\n[3] Nothing is easier than to familiarize one's self with the mammalian\nbrain. Get a sheep's head, a small saw, chisel, scalpel and forceps\n(all three can best be had from a surgical-instrument maker), and\nunravel its parts either by the aid of a human dissecting book, such as\nHolden's 'Manual of Anatomy,' or by the specific directions _ad hoc_\ngiven in such books as Foster and Langley's 'Practical Physiology'\n(Macmillan) or Morrell's 'Comparative Anatomy and Dissection of\nMammalia' (Longmans).\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN.\nIf I begin chopping the foot of a tree, its branches are unmoved by my\nact, and its leaves murmur as peacefully as ever in the wind. If, on\nthe contrary, I do violence to the foot of a fellow-man, the rest of\nhis body instantly responds to the aggression by movements of alarm or\ndefence. The reason of this difference is that the man has a nervous\nsystem whilst the tree has none; and the function of the nervous system\nis to bring each part into harmonious co-operation with every other.\nThe afferent nerves, when excited by some physical irritant, be this\nas gross in its mode of operation as a chopping axe or as subtle as\nthe waves of light, conveys the excitement to the nervous centres. The\ncommotion set up in the centres does not stop there, but discharges\nitself, if at all strong, through the efferent nerves into muscles\nand glands, exciting movements of the limbs and viscera, or acts of\nsecretion, which vary with the animal, and with the irritant applied.\nThese acts of response have usually the common character of being of\nservice. They ward off the noxious stimulus and support the beneficial\none; whilst if, in itself indifferent, the stimulus be a sign of some\ndistant circumstance of practical importance, the animal's acts are\naddressed to this circumstance so as to avoid its perils or secure its\nbenefits, as the case may be. To take a common example, if I hear the\nconductor calling 'All aboard!' as I enter the depot, my heart first\nstops, then palpitates, and my legs respond to the air-waves falling\non my tympanum by quickening their movements. If I stumble as I run,\nthe sensation of falling provokes a movement of the hands towards the\ndirection of the fall, the effect of which is to shield the body from\ntoo sudden a shock. If a cinder enter my eye, its lids close forcibly\nand a copious flow of tears tends to wash it out.\nThese three responses to a sensational stimulus differ, however, in\nmany respects. The closure of the eye and the lachrymation are quite\ninvoluntary, and so is the disturbance of the heart. Such involuntary\nresponses we know as 'reflex' acts. The motion of the arms to break the\nshock of falling may also be called reflex, since it occurs too quickly\nto be deliberately intended. Whether it be instinctive or whether it\nresult from the pedestrian education of childhood may be doubtful; it\nis, at any rate, less automatic than the previous acts, for a man might\nby conscious effort learn to perform it more skilfully, or even to\nsuppress it altogether. Actions of this kind, into which instinct and\nvolition enter upon equal terms, have been called 'semi-reflex.' The\nact of running towards the train, on the other hand, has no instinctive\nelement about it. It is purely the result of education, and is preceded\nby a consciousness of the purpose to be attained and a distinct mandate\nof the will. It is a 'voluntary act.' Thus the animal's reflex and\nvoluntary performances shade into each other gradually, being connected\nby acts which may often occur automatically, but may also be modified\nby conscious intelligence.\nAn outside observer, unable to perceive the accompanying consciousness,\nmight be wholly at a loss to discriminate between the automatic acts\nand those which volition escorted. But if the criterion of mind's\nexistence be the choice of the proper means for the attainment of a\nsupposed end, all the acts seem to be inspired by intelligence, for\n_appropriateness_ characterizes them all alike. This fact, now, has led\nto two quite opposite theories about the relation to consciousness of\nthe nervous functions. Some authors, finding that the higher voluntary\nones seem to require the guidance of feeling, conclude that over the\nlowest reflexes some such feeling also presides, though it may be a\nfeeling of which _we_ remain unconscious. Others, finding that reflex\nand semi-automatic acts may, notwithstanding their appropriateness,\ntake place with an unconsciousness apparently complete, fly to the\nopposite extreme and maintain that the appropriateness even of\nvoluntary actions owes nothing to the fact that consciousness attends\nthem. They are, according to these writers, results of physiological\nmechanism pure and simple. In a near chapter we shall return to this\ncontroversy again. Let us now look a little more closely at the brain\nand at the ways in which its states may be supposed to condition those\nof the mind.\nTHE FROG'S NERVE-CENTRES.\nBoth the minute anatomy and the detailed physiology of the brain are\nachievements of the present generation, or rather we may say (beginning\nwith Meynert) of the past twenty years. Many points are still obscure\nand subject to controversy; but a general way of conceiving the organ\nhas been reached on all hands which in its main feature seems not\nunlikely to stand, and which even gives a most plausible scheme of the\nway in which cerebral and mental operations go hand in hand.\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--_C H_, cerebral Hemispheres; _O Th_, Optic\nThalami; _O L_, Optic Lobes; _Cb_, Cerebellum; _M O_, Medulla\nOblongata; _S C_, Spinal cord.]\nThe best way to enter the subject will be to take a lower creature,\nlike a frog, and study by the vivisectional method the functions of\nhis different nerve-centres. The frog's nerve-centres are figured\nin the accompanying diagram, which needs no further explanation. I\nwill first proceed to state what happens when various amounts of the\nanterior parts are removed, in different frogs, in the way in which an\nordinary student removes them; that is, with no extreme precautions\nas to the purity of the operation. We shall in this way reach a very\nsimple conception of the functions of the various centres, involving\nthe strongest possible contrast between the cerebral hemispheres and\nthe lower lobes. This sharp conception will have didactic advantages,\nfor it is often very instructive to start with too simple a formula\nand correct it later on. Our first formula, as we shall later see,\nwill have to be softened down somewhat by the results of more careful\nexperimentation both on frogs and birds, and by those of the most\nrecent observations on dogs, monkeys, and man. But it will put us,\nfrom the outset, in clear possession of some fundamental notions and\ndistinctions which we could otherwise not gain so well, and none of\nwhich the later more completed view will overturn.\nIf, then, we reduce the frog's nervous system to the spinal cord\nalone, by making a section behind the base of the skull, between the\nspinal cord and the medulla oblongata, thereby cutting off the brain\nfrom all connection with the rest of the body, the frog will still\ncontinue to live, but with a very peculiarly modified activity. It\nceases to breathe or swallow; it lies flat on its belly, and does not,\nlike a normal frog, sit up on its fore paws, though its hind legs\nare kept, as usual, folded against its body and immediately resume\nthis position if drawn out. If thrown on its back, it lies there\nquietly, without turning over like a normal frog. Locomotion and voice\nseem entirely abolished. If we suspend it by the nose, and irritate\ndifferent portions of its skin by acid, it performs a set of remarkable\n'defensive' movements calculated to wipe away the irritant. Thus, if\nthe breast be touched, both fore paws will rub it vigorously; if we\ntouch the outer side of the elbow, the hind foot of the same side\nwill rise directly to the spot and wipe it. The back of the foot will\nrub the knee if that be attacked, whilst if the foot be cut away, the\nstump will make ineffectual movements, and then, in many frogs, a pause\nwill come, as if for deliberation, succeeded by a rapid passage of the\nopposite unmutilated foot to the acidulated spot.\nThe most striking character of all these movements, after their\nteleological appropriateness, is their precision. They vary, in\nsensitive frogs and with a proper amount of irritation, so little as\nalmost to resemble in their machine-like regularity the performances of\na jumping-jack, whose legs must twitch whenever you pull the string.\nThe spinal cord of the frog thus contains arrangements of cells and\nfibres fitted to convert skin irritations into movements of defence. We\nmay call it the _centre for defensive movements_ in this animal. We may\nindeed go farther than this, and by cutting the spinal cord in various\nplaces find that its separate segments are independent mechanisms,\nfor appropriate activities of the head and of the arms and legs\nrespectively. The segment governing the arms is especially active,\nin male frogs, in the breeding season; and these members alone with\nthe breast and back appertaining to them, everything else being cut\naway, will then actively grasp a finger placed between them and remain\nhanging to it for a considerable time.\nThe spinal cord in other animals has analogous powers. Even in man\nit makes movements of defence. Paraplegics draw up their legs when\ntickled; and Robin, on tickling the breast of a criminal an hour after\ndecapitation, saw the arm and hand move towards the spot. Of the lower\nfunctions of the mammalian cord, studied so ably by Goltz and others,\nthis is not the place to speak.\nIf, in a second animal, the cut be made just behind the optic lobes so\nthat the cerebellum and medulla oblongata remain attached to the cord,\nthen swallowing, breathing, crawling, and a rather enfeebled jumping\nand swimming are added to the movements previously observed.[4] There\nare other reflexes too. The animal, thrown on his back, immediately\nturns over to his belly. Placed in a shallow bowl, which is floated on\nwater and made to rotate, he responds to the rotation by first turning\nhis head and then waltzing around with his entire body, in the opposite\ndirection to the whirling of the bowl. If his support be tilted so that\nhis head points downwards, he points it up; he points it down if it be\npointed upwards, to the right if it be pointed to the left, etc. But\nhis reactions do not go farther than these movements of the head. He\nwill not, like frogs whose thalami are preserved, climb up a board if\nthe latter be tilted, but will slide off it to the ground.\nIf the cut be made on another frog between the thalami and the optic\nlobes, the locomotion both on land and water becomes quite normal, and,\nin addition to the reflexes already shown by the lower centres, he\ncroaks regularly whenever he is pinched under the arms. He compensates\nrotations, etc., by movements of the head, and turns over from his\nback; but still drops off his tilted board. As his optic nerves are\ndestroyed by the usual operation, it is impossible to say whether he\nwill avoid obstacles placed in his path.\nWhen, finally, a frog's cerebral hemispheres alone are cut off by a\nsection between them and the thalami which preserves the latter, an\nunpractised observer would not at first suspect anything abnormal\nabout the animal. Not only is he capable, on proper instigation, of\nall the acts already described, but he guides himself by sight, so\nthat if an obstacle be set up between him and the light, and he be\nforced to move forward, he either jumps over it or swerves to one\nside. He manifests sexual passion at the proper season, and, unlike an\naltogether brainless frog, which embraces anything placed between his\narms, postpones this reflex act until a female of his own species is\nprovided. Thus far, as aforesaid, a person unfamiliar with frogs might\nnot suspect a mutilation; but even such a person would soon remark the\nalmost entire absence of spontaneous motion--that is, motion unprovoked\nby any _present_ incitation of sense. The continued movements of\nswimming, performed by the creature in the water, seem to be the fatal\nresult of the contact of that fluid with its skin. They cease when a\nstick, for example, touches his hands. This is a sensible irritant\ntowards which the feet are automatically drawn by reflex action, and\non which the animal remains sitting. He manifests no hunger, and will\nsuffer a fly to crawl over his nose unsnapped at. Fear, too, seems\nto have deserted him. In a word, he is an extremely complex machine\nwhose actions, so far as they go, tend to self-preservation; but still\na _machine_, in this sense--that it seems to contain no incalculable\nelement. By applying the right sensory stimulus to him we are almost\nas certain of getting a fixed response as an organist is of hearing a\ncertain tone when he pulls out a certain stop.\nBut now if to the lower centres we add the cerebral hemispheres,\nor if, in other words, we make an intact animal the subject of our\nobservations, all this is changed. In addition to the previous\nresponses to present incitements of sense, our frog now goes through\nlong and complex acts of locomotion _spontaneously_, or as if moved by\nwhat in ourselves we should call an idea. His reactions to outward\nstimuli vary their form, too. Instead of making simple defensive\nmovements with his hind legs like a headless frog if touched, or of\ngiving one or two leaps and then sitting still like a hemisphereless\none, he makes persistent and varied efforts at escape, as if, not the\nmere contact of the physiologist's hand, but the notion of danger\nsuggested by it were now his spur. Led by the feeling of hunger, too,\nhe goes in search of insects, fish, or smaller frogs, and varies his\nprocedure with each species of victim. The physiologist cannot by\nmanipulating him elicit croaking, crawling up a board, swimming or\nstopping, at will. His conduct has become incalculable. We can no\nlonger foretell it exactly. Effort to escape is his dominant reaction,\nbut he _may_ do anything else, even swell up and become perfectly\npassive in our hands.\n*       *       *       *       *\nSuch are the phenomena commonly observed, and such the impressions\nwhich one naturally receives. Certain general conclusions follow\nirresistibly. First of all the following:\n_The acts of all the centres involve the use of the same muscles._ When\na headless frog's hind leg wipes the acid, he calls into play all the\nleg-muscles which a frog with his full medulla oblongata and cerebellum\nuses when he turns from his back to his belly. Their contractions are,\nhowever, _combined_ differently in the two cases, so that the results\nvary widely. We must consequently conclude that specific arrangements\nof cells and fibres exist in the cord for wiping, in the medulla for\nturning over, etc. Similarly they exist in the thalami for jumping\nover seen obstacles and for balancing the moved body; in the optic\nlobes for creeping backwards, or what not. But in the hemispheres,\nsince the presence of these organs _brings no new elementary form of\nmovement_ with it, but only _determines differently the occasions_\non which the movements shall occur, making the usual stimuli less\nfatal and machine-like; we need suppose no such machinery _directly_\nco-ordinative of muscular contractions to exist. We may rather\nassume, when the mandate for a wiping-movement is sent forth by the\nhemispheres, that a current goes straight to the wiping-arrangement in\nthe spinal cord, exciting this arrangement as a whole. Similarly, if an\nintact frog wishes to jump over a stone which he sees, all he need do\nis to excite from the hemispheres the jumping-centre in the thalami or\nwherever it may be, and the latter will provide for the details of the\nexecution. It is like a general ordering a colonel to make a certain\nmovement, but not telling him how it shall be done.[5]\n_The same muscle, then, is repeatedly represented at different\nheights;_ and at each it enters into a different combination with other\nmuscles to co-operate in some special form of concerted movement.\n_At each height the movement is discharged by some particular form\nof sensorial stimulus._ Thus in the cord, the skin alone occasions\nmovements; in the upper part of the optic lobes, the eyes are added;\nin the thalami, the semi-circular canals would seem to play a part;\nwhilst the stimuli which discharge the hemispheres would seem not so\nmuch to be elementary sorts of sensation, as groups of sensations\nforming determinate _objects_ or _things. Prey_ is not pursued nor are\n_enemies_ shunned by ordinary hemisphereless frogs. Those reactions\nupon complex circumstances which we call instinctive rather than\nreflex, are already in this animal dependent on the brain's highest\nlobes, and still more is this the case with animals higher in the\nzoological scale.\nThe results are just the same if, instead of a frog, we take a pigeon,\nand cut out his hemispheres as they are ordinarily cut out for a\nlecture-room demonstration. There is not a movement natural to him\nwhich this brainless bird cannot perform if expressly excited thereto;\nonly the inner promptings seem deficient, and when left to himself\nhe spends most of his time crouched on the ground with his head sunk\nbetween his shoulders as if asleep.\nGENERAL NOTION OF HEMISPHERES.\nAll these facts lead us, when we think about them, to some such\nexplanatory conception as this: _The lower centres act from present\nsensational stimuli alone; the hemispheres act from perceptions and\nconsiderations,_ the sensations which they may receive serving only as\nsuggesters of these. But what are perceptions but sensations grouped\ntogether? and what are considerations but expectations, in the fancy,\nof sensations which will be felt one way or another according as action\ntakes this course or that? If I step aside on seeing a rattlesnake,\nfrom considering how dangerous an animal he is, the mental materials\nwhich constitute my prudential reflection are images more or less vivid\nof the movement of his head, of a sudden pain in my leg, of a state of\nterror, a swelling of the limb, a chill, delirium, unconsciousness,\netc., etc., and the ruin of my hopes. But all these images are\nconstructed out of my past experiences. They are _reproductions_ of\nwhat I have felt or witnessed. They are, in short, _remote_ sensations;\nand the _difference between the hemisphereless animal and the whole\none_ may be concisely expressed by saying that the _one obeys absent,\nthe other only present, objects._\nThe hemispheres would then seem to be _the seat of memory_. Vestiges\nof past experience must in some way be stored up in them, and must,\nwhen aroused by present stimuli, first appear as representations of\ndistant goods and evils; and then must discharge into the appropriate\nmotor channels for warding off the evil and securing the benefits of\nthe good. If we liken the nervous currents to electric currents, we\ncan compare the nervous system, _C_, below the hemispheres to a direct\ncircuit from sense-organ to muscle along the line _S ... C ... M_ of\nFig. 2. The hemisphere, _H_, adds the long circuit or loop-line through\nwhich the current may pass when for any reason the direct line is not\nused.\nThus, a tired wayfarer on a hot day throws himself on the damp earth\nbeneath a maple-tree. The sensations of delicious rest and coolness\npouring themselves through the direct line would naturally discharge\ninto the muscles of complete extension: he would abandon himself\nto the dangerous repose. But the loop-line being open, part of the\ncurrent is drafted along it, and awakens rheumatic or catarrhal\nreminiscences, which prevail over the instigations of sense, and\nmake the man arise and pursue his way to where he may enjoy his rest\nmore safely. Presently we shall examine the manner in which the\nhemispheric loop-line may be supposed to serve as a reservoir for such\nreminiscences as these. Meanwhile I will ask the reader to notice some\ncorollaries of its being such a reservoir.\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\nFirst, no animal without it can deliberate, pause, postpone, nicely\nweigh one motive against another, or compare. Prudence, in a word,\nis for such a creature an impossible virtue. Accordingly we see that\nnature removes those functions in the exercise of which prudence is\na virtue from the lower centres and hands them over to the cerebrum.\nWherever a creature has to deal with complex features of the\nenvironment, prudence is a virtue. The higher animals have so to deal;\nand the more complex the features, the higher we call the animals. The\nfewer of his acts, then, can _such_ an animal perform without the help\nof the organs in question. In the frog many acts devolve wholly on the\nlower centres; in the bird fewer; in the rodent fewer still; in the dog\nvery few indeed; and in apes and men hardly any at all.\nThe advantages of this are obvious. Take the prehension of food as an\nexample and suppose it to be a reflex performance of the lower centres.\nThe animal will be condemned fatally and irresistibly to snap at it\nwhenever presented, no matter what the circumstances may be; he can no\nmore disobey this prompting than water can refuse to boil when a fire\nis kindled under the pot. His life will again and again pay the forfeit\nof his gluttony. Exposure to retaliation, to other enemies, to traps,\nto poisons, to the dangers of repletion, must be regular parts of his\nexistence. His lack of all thought by which to weigh the danger against\nthe attractiveness of the bait, and of all volition to remain hungry\na little while longer, is the direct measure of his lowness in the\nmental scale. And those fishes which, like our cunners and sculpins,\nare no sooner thrown back from the hook into the water, than they\nautomatically seize the hook again, would soon expiate the degradation\nof their intelligence by the extinction of their type, did not their\nexaggerated fecundity atone for their imprudence. Appetite and the acts\nit prompts have consequently become in all higher vertebrates functions\nof the cerebrum. They disappear when the physiologist's knife has left\nthe subordinate centres alone in place. The brainless pigeon will\nstarve though left on a corn-heap.\nTake again the sexual function. In birds this devolves exclusively\nupon the hemispheres. When these are shorn away the pigeon pays no\nattention to the billings and cooings of its mate. And Goltz found that\na bitch in heat would excite no emotion in male dogs who had suffered\nlarge loss of cerebral tissue. Those who have read Darwin's 'Descent of\nMan' know what immense importance in the amelioration of the breed in\nbirds this author ascribes to the mere fact of sexual selection. The\nsexual act is not performed until every condition of circumstance and\nsentiment is fulfilled, until time, place, and partner all are fit. But\nin frogs and toads this passion devolves on the lower centres. They\nshow consequently a machine-like obedience to the present incitement of\nsense, and an almost total exclusion of the power of choice. Copulation\noccurs _per fas aut nefas_, occasionally between males, often with dead\nfemales, in puddles exposed on the highway, and the male may be cut in\ntwo without letting go his hold. Every spring an immense sacrifice of\nbatrachian life takes place from these causes alone.\nNo one need be told how dependent all human social elevation is upon\nthe prevalence of chastity. Hardly any factor measures more than this\nthe difference between civilisation and barbarism. Physiologically\ninterpreted, chastity means nothing more than the fact that present\nsolicitations of sense are overpowered by suggestions of \u00e6sthetic and\nmoral fitness which the circumstances awaken in the cerebrum; and that\nupon the inhibitory or permissive influence of these alone action\ndirectly depends.\nWithin the psychic life due to the cerebrum itself the same general\ndistinction obtains, between considerations of the more immediate\nand considerations of the more remote. In all ages the man whose\ndeterminations are swayed by reference to the most distant ends has\nbeen held to possess the highest intelligence. The tramp who lives\nfrom hour to hour; the bohemian whose engagements are from day to day;\nthe bachelor who builds but for a single life; the father who acts\nfor another generation; the patriot who thinks of a whole community\nand many generations; and finally, the philosopher and saint whose\ncares are for humanity and for eternity,--these range themselves in\nan unbroken hierarchy, wherein each successive grade results from an\nincreased manifestation of the special form of action by which the\ncerebral centres are distinguished from all below them.\nIn the 'loop-line' along which the memories and ideas of the distant\nare supposed to lie, the action, so far as it is a physical process,\nmust be interpreted after the type of the action in the lower centres.\nIf regarded here as a reflex process, it must be reflex there as\nwell. The current in both places runs out into the muscles only after\nit has first run in; but whilst the path by which it runs out is\ndetermined in the lower centres by reflections few and fixed amongst\nthe cell-arrangements, in the hemispheres the reflections are many and\ninstable. This, it will be seen, is only a difference of degree and not\nof kind, and does not change the reflex type. The conception of _all_\naction as conforming to this type is the fundamental conception of\nmodern nerve-physiology. So much for our general preliminary conception\nof the nerve-centres! Let us define it more distinctly before we see\nhow well physiological observation will bear it out in detail.\nTHE EDUCATION OF THE HEMISPHERES.\nNerve-currents run in through sense-organs, and whilst provoking reflex\nacts in the lower centres, they arouse ideas in the hemispheres, which\neither permit the reflexes in question, check them, or substitute\nothers for them. All ideas being in the last resort reminiscences,\nthe question to answer is: _How can processes become organized in the\nhemispheres which correspond to reminiscences in the mind?_[6]\nNothing is easier than to conceive a _possible_ way in which this might\nbe done, provided four assumptions be granted. These assumptions (which\nafter all are inevitable in any event) are:\n1) The same cerebral process which, when aroused from without by a\nsense-organ, gives the perception of an object, will give an _idea_ of\nthe same object when aroused by other cerebral processes from within.\n2) If processes 1, 2, 3, 4 have once been aroused together or in\nimmediate succession, any subsequent arousal of any one of them\n(whether from without or within) will tend to arouse the others in the\noriginal order. [This is the so-called law of association.]\n3) Every sensorial excitement propagated to a lower centre tends to\nspread upwards and arouse an idea.\n4) Every idea tends ultimately either to produce a movement or to check\none which otherwise would be produced.\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\nSuppose now (these assumptions being granted) that we have a baby\nbefore us who sees a candle-flame for the first time, and, by virtue\nof a reflex tendency common in babies of a certain age, extends his\nhand to grasp it, so that his fingers get burned. So far we have two\nreflex currents in play: first, from the eye to the extension movement,\nalong the line 1--1--1--1 of Fig. 3; and second, from the finger to the\nmovement of drawing back the hand, along the line 2--2--2--2. If this\nwere the baby's whole nervous system, and if the reflexes were once for\nall organic, we should have no alteration in his behavior, no matter\nhow often the experience recurred. The retinal image of the flame would\nalways make the arm shoot forward, the burning of the finger would\nalways send it back. But we know that 'the burnt child dreads the\nfire,' and that one experience usually protects the fingers forever.\nThe point is to see how the hemispheres may bring this result to pass.\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--The dotted lines stand for afferent paths,\nthe broken lines for paths between the centres; the entire lines for\nefferent paths.]\nWe must complicate our diagram (see Fig. 4). Let the current 1--1,\nfrom the eye, discharge upward as well as downward when it reaches the\nlower centre for vision, and arouse the perceptional process _s^1_ in\nthe hemispheres; let the feeling of the arm's extension also send up\na current which leaves a trace of itself, _m^1_; let the burnt finger\nleave an analogous trace, _s^2_; and let the movement of retraction\nleave _m^2_. These four processes will now, by virtue of assumption\n2), be associated together by the path _s^1--m^1--s^2--m^2_, running\nfrom the first to the last, so that if anything touches off _s^1_,\nideas of the extension, of the burnt finger, and of the retraction will\npass in rapid succession through the mind. The effect on the child's\nconduct when the candle-flame is next presented is easy to imagine.\nOf course the sight of it arouses the grasping reflex; but it arouses\nsimultaneously the idea thereof, together with that of the consequent\npain, and of the final retraction of the hand; and if these cerebral\nprocesses prevail in strength over the immediate sensation in the\ncentres below, the last idea will be the cue by which the final action\nis discharged. The grasping will be arrested in mid-career, the hand\ndrawn back, and the child's fingers saved.\nIn all this we assume that the hemispheres do not _natively_ couple\nany particular sense-impression with any special motor discharge. They\nonly register, and preserve traces of, such couplings as are already\norganized in the reflex centres below. But this brings it inevitably\nabout that, when a chain of experiences has been already registered and\nthe first link is impressed once again from without, the last link will\noften be awakened in _idea_ long before it can exist in _fact_. And\nif this last link were previously coupled with a motion, that motion\nmay now come from the mere ideal suggestion without waiting for the\nactual impression to arise. Thus an animal with hemispheres acts in\n_anticipation_ of future things; or, to use our previous formula, he\nacts from considerations of distant good and ill. If we give the name\nof _partners_ to the original couplings of impressions with motions\nin a reflex way, then we may say that the function of the hemispheres\nis simply to bring about _exchanges among the partners_. Movement\n_m^n_, which natively is sensation _s^n_'s partner, becomes through\nthe hemispheres the partner of sensation _s^1, s^2_, or _s^3_. It is\nlike the great commutating switch-board at a central telephone station.\nNo new elementary process is involved; no impression nor any motion\npeculiar to the hemispheres; but any number of combinations impossible\nto the lower machinery taken alone, and an endless consequent increase\nin the possibilities of behavior on the creature's part.\nAll this, as a mere scheme,[7] is so clear and so concordant with the\ngeneral look of the facts as almost to impose itself on our belief;\nbut it is anything but clear in detail. The brain-physiology of late\nyears has with great effort sought to work out the paths by which\nthese couplings of sensations with movements take place, both in the\nhemispheres and in the centres below.\nSo we must next test our scheme by the facts discovered m this\ndirection. We shall conclude, I think, after taking them all into\naccount, that the scheme probably makes the lower centres too\nmachine-like and the hemispheres not quite machine-like enough, and\nmust consequently be softened down a little. So much I may say in\nadvance. Meanwhile, before plunging into the details which await us, it\nwill somewhat clear our ideas if we contrast the modern way of looking\nat the matter with the _phrenological_ conception which but lately\npreceded it.\nTHE PHRENOLOGICAL CONCEPTION.\nIn a certain sense Gall was the first to seek to explain in detail\nhow the brain could subserve our mental operations. His way of\nproceeding was only too simple. He took the faculty-psychology as his\nultimatum on the mental side, and he made no farther psychological\nanalysis. Wherever he found an individual with some strongly-marked\ntrait of character he examined his head; and if he found the latter\nprominent in a certain region, he said without more ado that that\nregion was the 'organ' of the trait or faculty in question. The traits\nwere of very diverse constitution, some being simple sensibilities\nlike 'weight' or 'color;' some being instinctive tendencies like\n'alimentiveness' or 'amativeness;' and others, again, being complex\nresultants like 'conscientiousness,' 'individuality.' Phrenology fell\npromptly into disrepute among scientific men because observation\nseemed to show that large faculties and large 'bumps' might fail to\ncoexist; because the scheme of Gall was so vast as hardly to admit\nof accurate determination at all--who of us can say even of his own\nbrothers whether their perceptions of _weight_ and of _time_ are well\ndeveloped or not?--because the followers of Gall and Spurzheim were\nunable to reform these errors in any appreciable degree; and, finally,\nbecause the whole analysis of faculties was vague and erroneous from\na psychologic point of view. Popular professors of the lore have\nnevertheless continued to command the admiration of popular audiences;\nand there seems no doubt that Phrenology, however little it satisfy\nour scientific curiosity about the functions of different portions of\nthe brain, may still be, in the hands of intelligent practitioners, a\nuseful help in the art of reading character. A hooked nose and a firm\njaw are usually signs of practical energy; soft, delicate hands are\nsigns of refined sensibility. Even so may a prominent eye be a sign\nof power over language, and a bull-neck a sign of sensuality. But\nthe brain behind the eye and neck need no more be the _organ_ of the\nsignified faculty than the jaw is the organ of the will or the hand\nthe organ of refinement. These correlations between mind and body are,\nhowever, so frequent that the 'characters' given by phrenologists are\noften remarkable for knowingness and insight.\nPhrenology hardly does more than restate the problem. To answer the\nquestion, \"Why do I like children?\" by saying, \"Because you have a\nlarge organ of philoprogenitiveness,\" but renames the phenomenon\nto be explained. What _is_ my philoprogenitiveness? Of what mental\nelements does it consist? And how _can_ a part of the brain be its\norgan? A science of the mind must reduce such complex manifestations\nas 'philoprogenitiveness' to their _elements_. A science of the brain\nmust point out the functions of _its_ elements. A science of the\nrelations of mind and brain must show how the elementary ingredients\nof the former correspond to the elementary functions of the latter.\nBut phrenology, except by occasional coincidence, takes no account of\nelements at all. Its 'faculties,' as a rule, are fully equipped persons\nin a particular mental attitude. Take, for example, the 'faculty' of\nlanguage. It involves in reality a host of distinct powers. We must\nfirst have images of concrete things and ideas of abstract qualities\nand relations; we must next have the memory of words and then the\ncapacity so to associate each idea or image with a particular word\nthat, when the word is heard, the idea shall forthwith enter our mind.\nWe must conversely, as soon as the idea arises in our mind, associate\nwith it a mental image of the word, and by means of this image we must\ninnervate our articulatory apparatus so as to reproduce the word as\nphysical sound. To read or to write a language other elements still\nmust be introduced. But it is plain that the faculty of spoken language\nalone is so complicated as to call into play almost all the elementary\npowers which the mind possesses, memory, imagination, association,\njudgment, and volition. A portion of the brain competent to be the\nadequate seat of such a faculty would needs be an entire brain in\nminiature,--just as the faculty itself is really a specification of the\nentire man, a sort of homunculus.\nYet just such homunculi are for the most part the phrenological organs.\nAs Lange says:\n\"We have a parliament of little men together, each one of whom, as\nhappens also in a real parliament, possesses but a single idea which\nhe ceaselessly strives to make prevail\"--benevolence, firmness, hope,\nand the rest. \"Instead of one soul, phrenology gives us forty, each\nalone as enigmatic as the full aggregate psychic life can be. Instead\nof dividing the latter into effective elements, she divides it into\npersonal beings of peculiar character.... 'Herr Pastor, sure there be\na horse inside,' called out the peasants to X after their spiritual\nshepherd had spent hours in explaining to them the construction of the\nlocomotive. With a horse inside truly everything becomes clear, even\nthough it be a queer enough sort of horse--the horse itself calls for\nno explanation! Phrenology takes a start to get beyond the point of\nview of the ghost-like soul entity, but she ends by populating the\nwhole skull with ghosts of the same order.\"[8]\nModern Science conceives of the matter in a very different way. _Brain\nand mind alike consist of simple elements, sensory and motor_. \"All\nnervous centres,\" says Dr. Hughlings Jackson,[9] \"from the lowest to\nthe very highest (the substrata of consciousness), are made up of\nnothing else than nervous arrangements, representing impressions and\nmovements.... I do not see of what other materials the brain _can_ be\nmade.\" Meynert represents the matter similarly when he calls the cortex\nof the hemispheres the surface of projection for every muscle and every\nsensitive point of the body. The muscles and the sensitive points are\n_represented_ each by a cortical point, and the brain is nothing but\nthe sum of all these cortical points, to which, on the mental side, as\nmany _ideas_ correspond. _Ideas of sensation, ideas of motion_ are,\non the other hand, _the elementary factors out of which the mind is\nbuilt up by the associationists in psychology_. There is a complete\nparallelism between the two analyses, the same diagram of little dots,\ncircles, or triangles joined by lines symbolizes equally well the\ncerebral and mental processes: the dots stand for cells or ideas, the\nlines for fibres or associations. We shall have later to criticise\nthis analysis so far as it relates to the mind; but there is no doubt\nthat it is a most convenient, and has been a most useful, hypothesis,\nformulating the facts in an extremely natural way.\nIf, then, we grant that motor and sensory ideas variously associated\nare the materials of the mind, all we need do to get a complete diagram\nof the mind's and the brain's relations should be to ascertain which\nsensory idea corresponds to which sensational surface of projection,\nand which motor idea to which muscular surface of projection. The\nassociations would then correspond to the fibrous connections between\nthe various surfaces. This distinct _cerebral localization_ of the\nvarious elementary sorts of idea has been treated as a 'postulate' by\nmany physiologists (e.g. Munk); and the most stirring controversy in\nnerve-physiology which the present generation has seen has been the\n_localization-question_.\nTHE LOCALIZATION OF FUNCTIONS IN THE HEMISPHERES.\nUp to 1870, the opinion which prevailed was that which the experiments\nof Flourens on pigeons' brains had made plausible, namely, that the\ndifferent functions of the hemispheres were not locally separated,\nbut carried on each by the aid of the whole organ. Hitzig in 1870\nshowed, however, that in a dog's brain highly specialized movements\ncould be produced by electric irritation of determinate regions of\nthe cortex; and Ferrier and Munk, half a dozen years later, seemed to\nprove, either by irritations or excisions or both, that there were\nequally determinate regions connected with the senses of sight, touch,\nhearing, and smell. Munk's special sensorial localizations, however,\ndisagreed with Ferrier's; and Goltz, from his extirpation-experiments,\ncame to a conclusion adverse to strict localization of any kind. The\ncontroversy is not yet over. I will not pretend to say anything more\nof it historically, but give a brief account of the condition in which\nmatters at present stand.\nThe one thing which is _perfectly_ well established is this, that the\n'central' convolutions, on either side of the fissure of Rolando, and\n(at least in the monkey) the calloso-marginal convolution (which is\ncontinuous with them on the mesial surface where one hemisphere is\napplied against the other), form the region by which all the motor\nincitations which leave the cortex pass out, on their way to those\nexecutive centres in the region of the pons, medulla, and spinal cord\nfrom which the muscular contractions are discharged in the last resort.\nThe existence of this so-called 'motor zone' is established by the\nlines of evidence successively given below:\n(1) _Cortical Irritations._ Electrical currents of small intensity\napplied to the surface of the said convolutions in dogs, monkeys, and\nother animals, produce well-defined movements in face, fore-limb,\nhind-limb, tail, or trunk, according as one point or another of the\nsurface is irritated. These movements affect almost invariably the\nside opposite to the brain irritations: If the left hemisphere be\nexcited, the movement is of the right leg, side of face, etc. All the\nobjections at first raised against the validity of these experiments\nhave been overcome. The movements are certainly not due to irritations\nof the base of the brain by the downward spread of the current, for:\n_a_) mechanical irritations will produce them, though less easily than\nelectrical; _b_) shifting the electrodes to a point close by on the\nsurface changes the movement in ways quite inexplicable by changed\nphysical conduction of the current; _c_) if the cortical 'centre'\nfor a certain movement be cut under with a sharp knife but left _in\nsitu_, although the electric conductivity is physically unaltered by\nthe operation, the physiological conductivity is gone and currents\nof the same strength no longer produce the movements which they\ndid; _d_) the time-interval between the application of the electric\nstimulus to the cortex and the resultant movement is what it would\nbe if the cortex acted physiologically and not merely physically in\ntransmitting the irritation. It is namely a well-known fact that when a\nnerve-current has to pass through the spinal cord to excite a muscle by\nreflex action, the time is longer than if it passes directly down the\nmotor nerve: the cells of the cord take a certain time to discharge.\nSimilarly, when a stimulus is applied directly to the cortex the muscle\ncontracts two or three hundredths of a second later than it does when\nthe place on the cortex is cut away and the electrodes are applied to\nthe white fibres below.[10]\n(2) _Cortical Ablations._ When the cortical spot which is found to\nproduce a movement of the fore-leg, in a dog, is excised (see spot 5\nin Fig. 5), the leg in question becomes peculiarly affected. At first\nit seems paralyzed. Soon, however, it is used with the other legs, but\nbadly. The animal does not bear his weight on it, allows it to rest on\nits dorsal surface, stands with it crossing the other leg, does not\nremove it if it hangs over the edge of a table, can no longer 'give the\npaw' at word of command if able to do so before the operation, does\nnot use it for scratching the ground, or holding a bone as formerly,\nlets it slip out when running on a smooth surface or when shaking\nhimself, etc., etc. Sensibility of all kinds seems diminished as well\nas motility, but of this I shall speak later on. Moreover the dog tends\nin voluntary movements to swerve towards the side of the brain-lesion\ninstead of going straight forward. All these symptoms gradually\ndecrease, so that even with a very severe brain-lesion the dog may be\noutwardly indistinguishable from a well dog after eight or ten weeks.\nStill, a slight chloroformization will reproduce the disturbances, even\nthen. There is a certain appearance of ataxic in-coordination in the\nmovements--the dog lifts his fore-feet high and brings them down with\nmore strength than usual, and yet the trouble is not ordinary lack of\nco-ordination. Neither is there paralysis. The strength of whatever\nmovements are made is as great as ever--dogs with extensive destruction\nof the motor zone can jump as high and bite as hard as ever they did,\nbut they seem _less easily moved_ to do _anything_ with the affected\nparts. Dr. Loeb, who has studied the motor disturbances of dogs more\ncarefully than any one, conceives of them _en masse_ as effects of an\nincreased inertia in all the processes of innervation towards the side\nopposed to the lesion. All such movements require an unwonted effort\nfor their execution; and when only the normally usual effort is made\nthey fall behind in effectiveness.[11]\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Left Hemisphere of Dog's Brain, after Ferrier.\n_A_, the fissure of Sylvius. _B_, the crucial sulcus. _O_, the\nolfactory bulb. _I, II, III, IV,_ indicate the first, second, third,\nand fourth external convolutions respectively. (1), (4), and (5) are on\nthe _sigmoid_ gyrus.]\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Left Hemisphere of Monkey's Brain. Outer\nSurface.]\nEven when the entire motor zone of a dog is removed, there is no\npermanent paralysis of any part, but only this curious sort of relative\ninertia when the two sides of the body are compared; and this itself\nbecomes hardly noticeable after a number of weeks have elapsed. Prof.\nGoltz has described a dog whose entire left hemisphere was destroyed,\nand who retained only a slight motor inertia on the right half of\nthe body. In particular he could use his right paw for holding a\nbone whilst gnawing it, or for reaching after a piece of meat. Had\nhe been taught to give his paw Before the operations, it would have\nbeen curious to see whether that faculty also came back. His tactile\nsensibility was permanently diminished on the right side.[12] In\n_monkeys_ a genuine paralysis follows upon ablations of the cortex\nin the motor region. This paralysis affects parts of the body which\nvary with the brain-parts removed. The monkey's opposite arm or leg\nhangs flaccid, or at most takes a small part in associated movements.\nWhen the entire region is removed there is a genuine and permanent\nhemiplegia in which the arm is more affected than the leg; and this\nis followed months later by contracture of the muscles, as in man\nafter inveterate hemiplegia.[13] According to Schaefer and Horsley, the\ntrunk-muscles also become paralyzed after destruction of the _marginal_\nconvolution on _both_ sides (see Fig. 7). These differences between\ndogs and monkeys show the danger of drawing general conclusions from\nexperiments done on any one sort of animal. I subjoin the figures\ngiven by the last-named authors of the motor regions in the monkey's\nbrain.[14]\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Left Hemisphere of Monkey's Brain. Mesial\nSurface.]\n_In man_ we are necessarily reduced to the observation _post-mortem_ of\ncortical ablations produced by accident or disease (tumor, hemorrhage,\nsoftening, etc.). What results during life from such conditions is\neither localized spasm, or palsy of certain muscles of the opposite\nside. The cortical regions which invariably produce these results are\nhomologous with those which we have just been studying in the dog,\ncat, ape, etc. Figs. 8 and 9 show the result of 169 cases carefully\nstudied by Exner. The parts shaded are regions where lesions produced\n_no_ motor disturbance. Those left white were, on the contrary, never\ninjured without motor disturbances of some sort. Where the injury to\nthe cortical substance is profound in man, the paralysis is permanent\nand is succeeded by muscular rigidity in the paralyzed parts, just as\nit may be in the monkey.\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Right Hemisphere of Human Brain. Lateral\nSurface.]\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Right Hemisphere of Human Brain. Mesial\nSurface.]\n(3) _Descending degenerations_ show the intimate connection of the\nrolandic regions of the cortex with the motor tracts of the cord. When,\neither in man or in the lower animals, these regions are destroyed, a\npeculiar degenerative change known as secondary sclerosis is found to\nextend downwards through the white fibrous substance of the brain in\na perfectly definite manner, affecting certain distinct strands which\npass through the inner capsule, crura, and pons, into the anterior\npyramids of the medulla oblongata, and from thence (partly crossing\nto the other side) downwards into the anterior (direct) and lateral\n(crossed) columns of the spinal cord.\n(4) _Anatomical proof_ of the continuity of the rolandic regions with\nthese motor columns of the cord is also clearly given. Flechsig's\n'Pyramidenbahn' forms an uninterrupted strand (distinctly traceable in\nhuman embryos, before its fibres have acquired their white 'medullary\nsheath') passing upwards from the pyramids of the medulla, and\ntraversing the internal capsule and corona radiata to the convolutions\nin question (Fig. 10). None of the inferior gray matter of the brain\nseems to have any connection with this important fibrous strand. It\npasses directly from the cortex to the motor arrangements in the cord,\ndepending for its proper nutrition (as the facts of degeneration show)\non the influence of the cortical cells, just as motor nerves depend for\ntheir nutrition on that of the cells of the spinal cord. Electrical\nstimulation of this motor strand in any accessible part of its course\nhas been shown in dogs to produce movements analogous to those which\nexcitement of the cortical surface calls forth.\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Schematic Transverse Section of Brain showing\nMotor Strand.--After Edinger.]\nOne of the most instructive proofs of motor localization in the\ncortex is that furnished by the disease now called aphemia, or _motor\nAphasia_. Motor aphasia is neither loss of voice nor paralysis of the\ntongue or lips. The patient's voice is as strong as ever, and all\nthe innervations of his hypoglossal and facial nerves, except those\nnecessary for speaking, may go on perfectly well. He can laugh and\ncry, and even sing; but he either is unable to utter any words at\nall; or a few meaningless stock phrases form his only speech; or else\nhe speaks incoherently and confusedly, mispronouncing, misplacing,\nand misusing his words in various degrees. Sometimes his speech is\na mere broth of unintelligible syllables. In cases of pure motor\naphasia the patient recognizes his mistakes and suffers acutely from\nthem. Now whenever a patient dies in such a condition as this, and an\nexamination of his brain is permitted, it is found that the lowest\nfrontal gyrus (see Fig. 11) is the seat of injury. Broca first noticed\nthis fact in 1861, and since then the gyrus has gone by the name of\nBroca's convolution. The injury in right-handed people is found on the\nleft hemisphere, and in left-handed people on the right hemisphere.\nMost people, in fact, are left-brained, that is, all their delicate\nand specialized movements are handed over to the charge of the left\nhemisphere. The ordinary right-handedness for such movements is only\na consequence of that fact, a consequence which shows outwardly on\naccount of that extensive decussation of the fibres whereby most of\nthose from the left hemisphere pass to the right half of the body only.\nBut the left-brainedness might exist in equal measure and not show\noutwardly. This would happen wherever organs on _both_ sides of the\nbody could be governed by the left hemisphere; and just such a case\nseems offered by the vocal organs, in that highly delicate and special\nmotor service which we call speech. Either hemisphere _can_ innervate\nthem bilaterally, just as either seems able to innervate bilaterally\nthe muscles of the trunk, ribs, and diaphragm. Of the special movements\nof speech, however, it would appear (from the facts of aphasia) that\nthe left hemisphere in most persons habitually takes exclusive charge.\nWith that hemisphere thrown out of gear, speech is undone; even though\nthe opposite hemisphere still be there for the performance of less\nspecialized acts, such as the various movements required in eating.\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Schematic Profile of Left Hemisphere, with\nthe parts shaded whose destruction causes motor ('Broca') and sensory\n('Wernicke') Aphasia.]\nIt will be noticed that Broca's region is homologous with the parts\nascertained to produce movements of the lips, tongue, and larynx when\nexcited by electric currents in apes (cf. Fig. 6). The evidence is\ntherefore as complete as it well can be that the motor incitations to\nthese organs leave the brain by the lower frontal region.\nVictims of motor aphasia generally have other disorders. One which\ninterests us in this connection has been called _agraphia_: they have\nlost the power to _write_. They can read writing and understand it;\nbut either cannot use the pen at all or make egregious mistakes with\nit. The seat of the lesion here is less well determined, owing to an\ninsufficient number of good cases to conclude from.[15] There is no\ndoubt, however, that it is (in right-handed people) on the left side,\nand little doubt that it consists of elements of the hand-and-arm\nregion specialized for that service, The symptom may exist when there\nis little or no disability in the hand for other uses. If it does not\nget well, the patient usually educates his right hemisphere, i.e.\nlearns to write with his left hand. In other cases of which we shall\nsay more a few pages later on, the patient can write both spontaneously\nand at dictation, but cannot _read_ even what he has himself written!\nAll these phenomena are now quite clearly explained by separate\nbrain-centres for the various feelings and movements and tracts for\nassociating these together. But their minute discussion belongs to\nmedicine rather than to general psychology, and I can only use them\nhere to illustrate the principles of motor localization.[16] Under the\nheads of sight and hearing I shall have a little more to say.\nThe different lines of proof which I have taken up establish\nconclusively the proposition that _all the motor impulses which leave\nthe cortex pass out_, in healthy animals, _from the convolutions about\nthe fissure of Rolando_.\nWhen, however, it comes to defining precisely what is involved in\na motor impulse leaving the cortex, things grow more obscure. Does\nthe impulse start independently from the convolutions in question,\nor does it start elsewhere and merely flow through? And to what\nparticular phase of psychic activity does the activity of these\ncentres correspond? Opinions and authorities here divide; but it will\nbe better, before entering into these deeper aspects of the problem,\nto cast a glance at the facts which have been made out concerning the\nrelations of the cortex to sight, hearing, and smell.\n_Sight._\nFerrier was the first in the field here. He found, when the _angular_\nconvolution (that lying between the 'intra parietal' and 'external\noccipital' fissures, and bending round the top of the fissure of\nSylvius, in Fig. 6) was excited in the monkey, that movements of\nthe eyes and head as if for vision occurred; and that when it was\nextirpated, what he supposed to be total and permanent blindness of\nthe opposite eye followed. Munk almost immediately declared total and\npermanent blindness to follow from destruction of the _occipital lobe_\nin monkeys as well as dogs, and said that the angular gyrus had nothing\nto do with sight, but was only the centre for tactile sensibility\nof the eyeball. Hunk's absolute tone about his observations and his\ntheoretic arrogance have led to his ruin as an authority. But he did\ntwo things of permanent value. He was the first to distinguish in these\nvivisections between sensorial and _psychic_ blindness, and to describe\nthe phenomenon of _restitution_ of the visual function after its first\nimpairment by an operation; and the first to notice the _hemiopic_\ncharacter of the visual disturbances which result when only one\nhemisphere is injured. Sensorial blindness is absolute insensibility\nto light; psychic blindness is inability to recognize the _meaning_ of\nthe optical impressions, as when we see a page of Chinese print but\nit suggests nothing to us. A hemiopic disturbance of vision is one in\nwhich neither retina is affected in its totality, but in which, for\nexample, the left portion of _each_ retina is blind, so that the animal\nsees nothing situated in space towards its right. Later observations\nhave corroborated this hemiopic character of all the disturbances of\nsight from injury to a single hemisphere in the higher animals; and the\nquestion whether an animal's apparent blindness is sensorial or only\npsychic has, since Munk's first publications, been the most urgent one\nto answer, in all observations relative to the function of sight.\nGoltz almost simultaneously with Ferrier and Munk reported experiments\nwhich led him to deny that the visual function was essentially bound\nup with any one localized portion of the hemispheres. Other divergent\nresults soon came in from many quarters, so that, without going into\nthe history of the matter any more, I may report the existing state of\nthe case as follows:[17]\nIn _fishes, frogs_, and _lizards_ vision persists when the hemispheres\nare entirely removed. This is admitted for frogs and fishes even by\nMunk, who denies it for birds.\nAll of Munk's _birds_ seemed totally blind (blind sensorially) after\nremoval of the hemispheres by his operation. The following of a candle\nby the head and winking at a threatened blow, which are ordinarily held\nto prove the retention of crude optical sensations by the lower centres\nin supposed hemisphereless pigeons, are by Munk ascribed to vestiges\nof the visual sphere of the cortex left behind by the imperfection of\nthe operation. But Schrader, who operated after Munk and with every\napparent guarantee of completeness, found that all his pigeons saw\nafter two or three weeks had elapsed, and the inhibitions resulting\nfrom the wound had passed away. They invariably avoided even the\nslightest obstacles, flew very regularly towards certain perches, etc.,\ndiffering _toto c\u0153lo_ in these respects with certain simply _blinded_\npigeons who were kept with them for comparison. They did not pick up\nfood strewn on the ground, however. Schrader found that they would do\nthis if even a small part of the frontal region of the hemispheres\nwas left, and ascribes their non-self-feeding when deprived of their\noccipital cerebrum not to a visual, but to a motor, defect, a sort of\nalimentary aphasia.[18]\nIn presence of such discord as that between Munk and his opponents\none must carefully note how differently significant is _loss_, from\n_preservation_, of a function after an operation on the brain. The\n_loss_ of the function does not necessarily show that it _is_ dependent\non the part cut out; but its _preservation_ does show that it is\n_not_ dependent: and this is true though the loss should be observed\nninety-nine times and the preservation only once in a hundred similar\nexcisions. That birds and mammals _can_ be blinded by cortical ablation\nis undoubted; the only question is, _must_ they be so? Only then can\nthe cortex be certainly called the 'seat of sight.' The blindness may\nalways be due to one of those remote effects of the wound on distant\nparts, inhibitions, extensions of inflammation,--interferences, in\na word,--upon which Brown-S\u00e9quard and Goltz have rightly insisted,\nand the importance of which becomes more manifest every day. Such\neffects are transient; whereas the _symptoms of deprivation_\n(_Ausfallserscheinungen_, as Goltz calls them) which come from the\nactual loss of the cut-out region must from the nature of the case\nbe permanent. Blindness in the pigeons, _so far as it passes away_,\ncannot possibly be charged to their seat of vision being lost, but only\nto some influence which temporarily depresses the activity of that\nseat. The same is true _mutatis mutandis_ of all the other effects\nof operations, and as we pass to mammals we shall see still more the\nimportance of the remark.\n_In rabbits_ loss of the entire cortex seems compatible with the\npreservation of enough sight to guide the poor animals' movements,\nand enable them to avoid obstacles. Christiani's observations and\ndiscussions seem conclusively to have established this, although Munk\nfound that all _his_ animals were made totally blind.[19]\n_In dogs_ also Munk found absolute stone-blindness after ablation\nof the occipital lobes. He went farther and mapped out determinate\nportions of the cortex thereupon, which he considered correlated with\ndefinite segments of the two retin\u00e6, so that destruction of given\nportions of the cortex produces blindness of the retinal centre, top,\nbottom, or right or left side, of the same or opposite eye. There\nseems little doubt that this definite correlation is mythological.\nOther observers, Hitzig, Goltz, Luciani, Loeb, Exner, etc., find,\nwhatever part of the cortex may be ablated on one side, that there\nusually results a _hemiopic_ disturbance of _both_ eyes, slight and\ntransient when the anterior lobes are the parts attacked, grave when an\noccipital lobe is the seat of injury, and lasting in proportion to the\nlatter's extent. According to Loeb, the defect is a dimness of vision\n('hemiamblyopia') in which (however severe) the centres remain the\nbest seeing portions of the retina, just as they are in normal dogs.\nThe lateral or temporal part of each retina seems to be in exclusive\nconnection with the cortex of its own side. The centre and nasal part\nof each seems, on the contrary, to be connected with the cortex of\nthe opposite hemispheres. Loeb, who takes broader views than any one,\nconceives the hemiamblyopia as he conceives the motor disturbances,\nnamely, as the expression of an increased inertia in the whole optical\nmachinery, of which the result is to make the animal respond with\ngreater effort to impressions coming from the half of space opposed to\nthe side of the lesion. If a dog has right hemiamblyopia, say, and two\npieces of meat are hung before him at once, he invariably turns first\nto the one on his left. But if the lesion be a slight one, _shaking_\nslightly the piece of meat on his right (this makes of it a stronger\nstimulus) makes him seize upon it first. If only one piece of meat be\noffered, he takes it, on whichever side it be.\n[Illustration: FIGS. 12 and 13. The Dog's visual centre according to\nMunk, the entire striated region, _A, A_, being the exclusive seat of\nvision, and the dark central circle, _A^1_, being correlated with the\nretinal centre of the opposite eye.]\nWhen both occipital lobes are extensively destroyed total blindness\nmay result. Munk maps out his 'Sehsph\u00e4re' definitely, and says that\nblindness _must_ result when the entire shaded part, marked _A, A,_ in\nFigs. 12 and 13, is involved in the lesion. Discrepant reports of other\nobservations he explains as due to incomplete ablation. Luciani, Goltz,\nand Lannegrace, however, contend that they have made complete bilateral\nextirpations of Munk's Sehsph\u00e4re more than once, and found a sort of\ncrude indiscriminating sight of objects to return in a few weeks.[20]\nThe question whether a dog is blind or not is harder to solve than\nwould at first appear; for simply blinded dogs, in places to which they\nare accustomed, show little of their loss and avoid all obstacles;\nwhilst dogs whose occipital lobes are gone may run against things\nfrequently and yet see notwithstanding. The best proof that they may\nsee is that which Goltz's dogs furnished: they carefully avoided, as it\nseemed, strips of sunshine or paper on the floor, as if they were solid\nobstacles. This no really blind dog would do. Luciani tested his dogs\nwhen hungry (a condition which sharpens their attention) by strewing\npieces of meat and pieces of cork before them. If they went straight\nat them, they _saw_; and if they chose the meat and left the cork,\nthey _saw discriminatingly_. The quarrel is very acrimonious; indeed\nthe subject of localization of functions in the brain seems to have a\npeculiar effect on the temper of those who cultivate it experimentally.\nThe amount of preserved vision which Goltz and Luciani report seems\nhardly to be worth considering, on the one hand; and on the other, Munk\nadmits in his penultimate paper that out of 85 dogs he only 'succeeded'\n4 times in his operation of producing complete blindness by complete\nextirpation of his 'Sehsph\u00e4re.'[21] The safe conclusion for _us_ is\nthat Luciani's diagram, Fig. 14, represents something like the truth.\nThe occipital lobes are far more important for vision than any other\npart of the cortex, so that their complete destruction makes the animal\nalmost blind. As for the crude sensibility to light which _may_ then\nremain, nothing exact is known either about its nature or its seat.\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Distribution of the Visual Function in the\nCortex, according to Luciani.]\n_In the monkey_, doctors also disagree. The truth seems, however, to be\nthat the _occipital lobes_ in this animal also are the part connected\nmost intimately with the visual function. The function would seem to\ngo on when very small portions of them are left, for Ferrier found no\n'appreciable impairment' of it after almost complete destruction of\nthem on both sides. On the other hand, he found complete and permanent\nblindness to ensue when they and the _angular gyri_ in addition were\ndestroyed on both sides. Munk, as well as Brown and Schaefer, found no\ndisturbance of sight from destroying the _angular gyri_ alone, although\nFerrier found blindness to ensue. This blindness was probably due to\ninhibitions exerted _in distans_, or to cutting of the white optical\nfibres passing under the angular gyri on their way to the occipital\nlobes. Brown and Schaefer got complete and permanent blindness in\none monkey from total destruction of both occipital lobes. Luciani\nand Seppili, performing this operation on two monkeys, found that\nthe animals were only mentally, not sensorially, blind. After some\nweeks they saw their food, but could not distinguish by sight between\nfigs and pieces of cork. Luciani and Seppili seem, however, not to\nhave extirpated the entire lobes. When one lobe only is injured the\naffection of sight is hemiopic in monkeys: in this all observers agree.\nOn the whole, then, Munk's original location of vision in the occipital\nlobes is confirmed by the later evidence.[22]\n_In man_ we have more exact results, since we are not driven to\ninterpret the vision from the outward conduct. On the other hand,\nhowever, we cannot vivisect, but must wait for pathological lesions\nto turn up. The pathologists who have discussed these (the literature\nis tedious _ad libitum_) conclude that the occipital lobes are the\nindispensable part for vision in man. Hemiopic disturbance in both eyes\ncomes from lesion of either one of them, and total blindness, sensorial\nas well as psychic, from destruction of both.\nHemiopia may also result from lesion in other parts, especially the\nneighboring angular and supra-marginal gyri, and it may accompany\nextensive injury in the motor region of the cortex. In these cases\nit seems probable that it is due to an _actio in distans_, probably\nto the interruption of fibres proceeding from the occipital lobe.\nThere seem to be a few cases on record where there was injury to the\noccipital lobes without visual defect. Ferrier has collected as many\nas possible to prove his localization in the angular gyrus.[23] A\nstrict application of logical principles would make one of these cases\noutweigh one hundred contrary ones. And yet, remembering how imperfect\nobservations may be, and how individual brains may vary, it would\ncertainly be rash for their sake to throw away the enormous amount\nof positive evidence for the occipital lobes. Individual variability\nis always a _possible_ explanation of an anomalous case. There is no\nmore prominent anatomical fact than that of the 'decussation of the\npyramids,' nor any more usual pathological fact than its consequence,\nthat left-handed hemorrhages into the motor region produce right-handed\nparalyses. And yet the decussation is variable in amount, and seems\nsometimes to be absent altogether.[24] If, in such a case as this last,\nthe left brain were to become the seat of apoplexy, the left and not\nthe right half of the body would be the one to suffer paralysis.\nThe _schema_ below [Fig. 15], copied from Dr. Seguin, expresses, on\nthe whole, the probable truth about the regions concerned in vision.\nNot the entire occipital lobes, but the so-called cunei, and the\nfirst convolutions, are the cortical parts most intimately concerned.\nNothnagel agrees with Seguin in this limitation of the essential\ntracts.[25]\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Scheme of the mechanism of vision, after\nSeguin. The _cuneus_ convolution (_Cu_) of the right occipital lobe is\nsupposed to be injured, and all the parts which lead to it are darkly\nshaded to show that they fail to exert their function. _F. O._ are the\nintra-hemispheric optical fibres. _P. O. C._ is the region of the lower\noptic centres (corpora geniculata and quadrigemina). _T. O. D._ is the\nright optic tract; _C_, the chiasma; _F. L. D._ are the fibres going\nto the lateral or temporal half _T_ of the right retina; and _F. C. S._\nare those going to the central or nasal half of the left retina. _O.\nD._ is the right, and _O. S._ the left eyeball. The rightward half of\neach is therefore blind: in other words, the right nasal field, _R. N.\nF._, and the left temporal field _L. T. F._, have become invisible to\nthe subject with the lesion at _Cu_.]\n*       *       *       *       *\nA most interesting effect of cortical disorder is _mental blindness_.\nThis consists not so much in insensibility to optical impressions, as\nin _inability to understand them_. Psychologically it is interpretable\nas _loss of associations_ between optical sensations and what they\nsignify; and any interruption of the paths between the optic centres\nand the centres for other ideas ought to bring it about. Thus, printed\nletters of the alphabet, or words, signify certain sounds and certain\narticulatory movements. If the connection between the articulating or\nauditory centres, on the one hand, and the visual centres on the other,\nbe ruptured we ought _a priori_ to expect that the sight of words would\nfail to awaken the idea of their sound, or the movement for pronouncing\nthem. We ought, in short, to have _alexia_, or inability to read:\nand this is just what we do have in many cases of extensive injury\nabout the fronto-temporal regions, as a complication of _aphasic_\ndisease. Nothnagel suggests that whilst the _cuneus_ is the seat of\noptical _sensations_, the other parts of the occipital lobe may be the\nfield of optical _memories and ideas_, from the loss of which mental\nblindness should ensue. In fact, all the medical authors speak of\nmental blindness as if it must consist in the loss of visual images\nfrom the memory. It seems to me, however, that this is a psychological\nmisapprehension. A man whose power of visual imagination has decayed\n(no unusual phenomenon in its lighter grades) is not mentally blind\nin the least, for he recognizes perfectly all that he sees. On the\nother hand, he _may_ be mentally blind, with his optical imagination\nwell preserved; as in the interesting case published by Wilbrand in\n1887.[26] In the still more interesting case of mental blindness\nrecently published by Lissauer,[27] though the patient made the most\nludicrous mistakes, calling for instance a clothes-brush a pair of\nspectacles, an umbrella a plant with flowers, an apple a portrait of\na lady, etc. etc., he seemed, according to the reporter, to have his\nmental images fairly well preserved. It is in fact the momentary loss\nof our _non_-optical images which makes us mentally blind, just as it\nis that of our _non_-auditory images which makes us mentally deaf. I\nam mentally deaf if, _hearing_ a bell, I can't recall how it _looks_;\nand mentally blind if, _seeing_ it, I can't recall its _sound or its\nname_. As a matter of fact, I should have to be not merely mentally\nblind, but stone-blind, if all my visual images were lost. For although\nI am blind to the right half of the field of view if my left occipital\nregion is injured, and to the left half if my right region is injured,\nsuch hemianopsia does not deprive me of visual _images_, experience\nseeming to show that the unaffected hemisphere is always sufficient\nfor production of these. To abolish them entirely I should have to be\ndeprived of both occipital lobes, and that would deprive me not only\nof my inward images of sight, but of my sight altogether.[28] Recent\npathological annals seem to offer a few such cases.[29] Meanwhile there\nare a number of cases of mental blindness, especially for written\nlanguage, coupled with hemianopsia, usually of the rightward field of\nview. These are all explicable by the breaking down, through disease,\nof the _connecting tracts_ between the occipital lobes and other parts\nof the brain, especially those which go to the centres for speech in\nthe frontal and temporal regions of the left hemisphere. They are to\nbe classed among disturbances of _conduction_ or of _association_;\nand nowhere can I find any fact which should force us to believe that\noptical images need[30] be lost in mental blindness, or that the\ncerebral centres for such images are locally distinct from those for\ndirect sensations from the eyes.[31]\nWhere an object fails to be recognized by sight, it often happens\nthat the patient will recognize and name it as soon as he touches it\nwith his hand. This shows in an interesting way how numerous the\nassociative paths are which all end by running out of the brain through\nthe channel of speech. The hand-path is open, though the eye-path be\nclosed. When mental blindness is most complete, neither sight, touch,\nnor sound avails to steer the patient, and a sort of dementia which\nhas been called _asymbolia_ or _apraxia_ is the result. The commonest\narticles are not understood. The patient will put his breeches on one\nshoulder and his hat upon the other, will bite into the soap and lay\nhis shoes on the table, or take his food into his hand and throw it\ndown again, not knowing what to do with it, etc. Such disorder can only\ncome from extensive brain-injury.[32]\nThe _method of degeneration_ corroborates the other evidence localizing\nthe tracts of vision. In young animals one gets secondary degeneration\nof the occipital regions from destroying an eyeball, and, _vice vers\u00e2_,\ndegeneration of the optic nerves from destroying the occipital regions.\nThe corpora geniculata, thalami, and subcortical fibres leading to the\noccipital lobes are also found atrophied in these cases. The phenomena\nare not uniform, but are indisputable;[33] so that, taking all lines of\nevidence together, the special connection of vision with the occipital\nlobes is perfectly made out. It should be added, that the occipital\nlobes have frequently been found shrunken in cases of inveterate\nblindness in man.\n_Hearing._\nHearing is hardly as definitely localized as sight. _In the dog_,\nLuciani's diagram will show the regions which directly or indirectly\naffect it for the worse when injured. As with sight, one-sided lesions\nproduce symptoms on both sides. The mixture of black dots and gray dots\nin the diagram is meant to represent this mixture of 'crossed' and\n'uncrossed' connections, though of course no topographical exactitude\nis aimed at. Of all the region, the temporal lobe is the most important\npart; yet permanent absolute deafness did not result in a dog of\nLuciani's, even from bilateral destruction of both temporal lobes in\ntheir entirety.[34]\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Luciani's Hearing Region.]\n_In the monkey_, Ferrier and Yeo once found permanent deafness to\nfollow destruction of the upper temporal convolution (the one just\nbelow the fissure of Sylvius in Fig. 6) on both sides. Brown and\nSchaefer found, on the contrary, that in several monkeys this operation\nfailed to noticeably affect the hearing. In one animal, indeed, both\nentire temporal lobes were destroyed. After a week or two of depression\nof the mental faculties this beast recovered and became one of the\nbrightest monkeys possible, domineering over all his mates, and\nadmitted by all who saw him to have all his senses, including hearing,\n'perfectly acute.'[35] Terrible recriminations have, as usual, ensued\nbetween the investigators, Ferrier denying that Brown and Schaefer's\nablations were complete,[36] Schaefer that Ferrier's monkey was really\ndeaf.[37] In this unsatisfactory condition the subject must be left,\nalthough there seems no reason to doubt that Brown and Schaefer's\nobservation is the more important of the two.\n_In man_ the temporal lobe is unquestionably the seat of the hearing\nfunction, and the superior convolution adjacent to the sylvian fissure\nis its most important part. The phenomena of aphasia show this. We\nstudied motor aphasia a few pages back; we must now consider _sensory\naphasia_. Our knowledge of this disease has had three stages: we may\ntalk of the period of Broca, the period of Wernicke, and the period\nof Charcot. What Broca's discovery was we have seen. Wernicke was the\nfirst to discriminate those cases in which the patient can _not even\nunderstand_ speech from those in which he can understand, only not\ntalk; and to ascribe the former condition to lesion of the temporal\nlobe.[38] The condition in question is _word-deafness_, and the disease\nis _auditory aphasia_. The latest statistical survey of the subject is\nthat by Dr. Allen Starr.[39] In the seven cases of _pure_ word-deafness\nwhich he has collected, cases in which the patient could read, talk,\nand write, but not understand what was said to him, the lesion was\nlimited to the first and second temporal convolutions in their\nposterior two thirds. The lesion (in right-handed, i.e. left-brained,\npersons) is always on the left side, like the lesion in motor aphasia.\nCrude hearing would not be abolished, even were the left centre for it\nutterly destroyed; the right centre would still provide for that. But\nthe _linguistic use_ of hearing appears bound up with the integrity of\nthe left centre more or less exclusively. Here it must be that words\nheard enter into association with the things which they represent, on\nthe one hand, and with the movements necessary for pronouncing them, on\nthe other. In a large majority of Dr. Starr's fifty cases, the power\neither to name objects or to talk coherently was impaired. This shows\nthat in most of us (as Wernicke said) speech must go on from auditory\ncues; that is, it must be that our ideas do not innervate our motor\ncentres directly, but only after first arousing the mental sound of\nthe words. This is the immediate stimulus to articulation; and where\nthe possibility of this is abolished by the destruction of its usual\nchannel in the left temporal lobe, the articulation must suffer. In\nthe few cases in which the channel is abolished with no bad effect on\nspeech we must suppose an idiosyncrasy. The patient must innervate\nhis speech-organs either from the corresponding portion of the other\nhemisphere or directly from the centres of ideation, those, namely,\nof vision, touch, etc., without leaning on the auditory region. It\nis the minuter analysis of the facts in the light of such individual\ndifferences as these which constitutes Charcot's contribution towards\nclearing up the subject.\nEvery nameable thing, act, or relation has numerous properties,\nqualities, or aspects. In our minds the properties of each thing,\ntogether with its name, form an associated group. If different parts\nof the brain are severally concerned with the several properties, and\na farther part with the hearing, and still another with the uttering,\nof the name, there must inevitably be brought about (through the law\nof association which we shall later study) such a dynamic connection\namongst all these brain-parts that the activity of any one of them will\nbe likely to awaken the activity of all the rest. When we are talking\nas we think, the _ultimate_ process is that of utterance. If the\nbrain-part for _that_ be injured, speech is impossible or disorderly,\neven though all the other brain-parts be intact: and this is just the\ncondition of things which, on page 37, we found to be brought about\nby limited lesion of the left inferior frontal convolution. But back\nof that last act various orders of succession are possible in the\nassociations of a talking man's ideas. The more usual order seems\nto be from the tactile, visual, or other properties of the things\nthought-about to the sound of their names, and then to the latter's\nutterance. But if in a certain individual the thought of the _look_ of\nan object or of the _look_ of its printed name be the process which\nhabitually precedes articulation, then the loss of the _hearing_ centre\nwill _pro tanto_ not affect that individual's speech. He will be\nmentally deaf, i.e. his _understanding_ of speech will suffer, but he\nwill not be aphasic. In this way it is possible to explain the seven\ncases of _pure_ word-deafness which figure in Dr. Starr's table.\nIf this order of association be ingrained and habitual in that\nindividual, injury to his _visual_ centres will make him not only\nword-blind, but aphasic as well. His speech will become confused in\nconsequence of an occipital lesion. Naunyn, consequently, plotting\nout on a diagram of the hemisphere the 71 irreproachably reported\ncases of aphasia which he was able to collect, finds that the lesions\nconcentrate themselves in three places: first, on Broca's centre;\nsecond, on Wernicke's; third, on the supra-marginal and angular gyri\nunder which those fibres pass which connect the visual centres with\nthe rest of the brain[40] (see Fig. 17). With this result Dr. Starr's\nanalysis of purely sensory cases agrees.\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\nIn a later chapter we shall again return to these differences in\nthe effectiveness of the sensory spheres in different individuals.\nMeanwhile few things show more beautifully than the history of our\nknowledge of aphasia how the sagacity and patience of many banded\nworkers are in time certain to analyze the darkest confusion into an\norderly display.[41] There is no 'centre of Speech' in the brain any\nmore than there is a faculty of Speech in the mind. The entire brain,\nmore or less, is at work in a man who uses language. The subjoined\ndiagram, from Boss, shows the four parts most critically concerned,\nand, in the light of our text, needs no farther explanation (see Fig.\n18).\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\n_Smell._\nEverything conspires to point to the median descending part of the\ntemporal lobes as being the organs of smell. Even Ferrier and Munk\nagree on the hippocampal gyrus, though Ferrier restricts olfaction, as\nMunk does not, to the lobule or uncinate process of the convolution,\nreserving the rest of it for touch. Anatomy and pathology also point to\nthe hippocampal gyrus; but as the matter is less interesting from the\npoint of view of human psychology than were sight and hearing, I will\nsay no more, but simply add Luciani and Seppili's diagram of the dog's\nsmell-centre.[42] Of\n_Taste_\nwe know little that is definite. What little there is points to the\nlower temporal regions again. Consult Ferrier as below.\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Luciani's Olfactory Region in the Dog.]\n_Touch._\nInteresting problems arise with regard to the seat of tactile and\nmuscular sensibility. Hitzig, whose experiments on _dogs' brains_\nfifteen years ago opened the entire subject which we are discussing,\nascribed the disorders of motility observed after ablations of the\nmotor region to a loss of what he called muscular consciousness.\nThe animals do not notice eccentric positions of their limbs, will\nstand with their legs crossed, with the affected paw resting on its\nback or hanging over a table's edge, etc.; and do not resist our\nbending and stretching of it as they resist with the unaffected paw.\nGoltz, Munk, Schiff, Herzen, and others promptly ascertained an equal\ndefect of cutaneous sensibility to pain, touch, and cold. The paw\nis not withdrawn when pinched, remains standing in cold water, etc.\nFerrier meanwhile denied that there was any true an\u00e6sthesia produced\nby ablations in the motor zone, and explains the appearance of it as\nan effect of the sluggish motor responses of the affected side.[43]\nMunk[44] and Schiff[45], on the contrary, conceive of the 'motor\nzone' as essentially sensory, and in different ways explain the motor\ndisorders as secondary results of the an\u00e6sthesia which is always there,\nMunk calls the motor zone the F\u00fchlsph\u00e4re of the animal's limbs, etc.,\nand makes it co\u00f6rdinate with the Sehsph\u00e4re, the H\u00f6rsph\u00e4re, etc., the\nentire cortex being, according to him, nothing but a projection-surface\nfor sensations, with no exclusively or essentially motor part. Such a\nview would be important if true, through its bearings on the psychology\nof volition. What is the truth? As regards the fact of cutaneous\nan\u00e6sthesia from motor-zone ablations, all other observers are against\nFerrier, so that he is probably wrong in denying it. On the other hand,\nMunk and Schiff are wrong in making the motor symptoms _depend_ on\nthe an\u00e6sthesia, for in certain rare cases they have been observed to\nexist not only without insensibility, but with actual hyper\u00e6sthesia of\nthe parts.[46] The motor and sensory symptoms seem, therefore, to be\nindependent variables.\n_In monkeys_ the latest experiments are those of Horsley and\nSchaefer,[47] whose results Ferrier accepts. They find that excision\nof the hippocampal convolution produces transient insensibility of\nthe opposite side of the body, and that permanent insensibility is\nproduced by destruction of its continuation upwards above the corpus\ncallosum, the so-called _gyrus fornicatus_ (the part just below\nthe 'calloso-marginal fissure' in Fig. 7). The insensibility is at\nits maximum when the entire tract comprising both convolutions is\ndestroyed. Ferrier says that the sensibility of monkeys is 'entirely\nunaffected' by ablations of the motor zone,[48] and Horsley and\nSchaefer consider it by no means necessarily abolished.[49] Luciani\nfound it diminished in his three experiments on apes.[50]\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Luciani's Tactile Region in the Dog.]\n_In man_ we have the fact that one-sided paralysis from disease of the\nopposite motor zone may or may not be accompanied with an\u00e6sthesia of\nthe parts. Luciani, who believes that the motor zone is also sensory,\ntries to minimize the value of this evidence by pointing to the\ninsufficiency with which patients are examined. He himself believes\nthat in dogs the tactile sphere extends backwards and forwards of the\ndirectly excitable region, into the frontal and parietal lobes (see\nFig. 20). Nothnagel considers that pathological evidence points in the\nsame direction;[51] and Dr. Mills, carefully reviewing the evidence,\nadds the gyri fornicatus and hippocampi to the cutaneo-muscular\nregion in man.[52] If one compare Luciani's diagrams together (Figs.\n14, 16, 19, 20) one will see that the entire parietal region of the\ndog's skull is common to the four senses of sight, hearing, smell,\nand touch, including muscular feeling. The corresponding region in\nthe human brain (upper parietal and supra-marginal gyri--see Fig. 17)\nseems to be a somewhat similar place of conflux. Optical aphasias and\nmotor and tactile disturbances all result from its injury, especially\nwhen that is on the left side.[53] The lower we go in the animal scale\nthe less differentiated the functions of the several brain-parts seem\nto be.[54] It may be that the region in question still represents\nin ourselves something like this primitive condition, and that the\nsurrounding parts, in adapting themselves more and more to specialized\nand narrow functions, have left it as a sort of _carrefour_ through\nwhich they send currents and converse. That it should be connected\nwith musculo-cutaneous feeling is, however, no reason why the motor\nzone proper should not be so connected too. And the cases of paralysis\nfrom the motor zone with no accompanying an\u00e6sthesia may be explicable\nwithout denying all sensory function to that region. For, as my\ncolleague Dr. James Putnam informs me, sensibility is always harder to\nkill than motility, even where we know for a certainty that the lesion\naffects tracts that are both sensory and motor. Persons whose hand is\nparalyzed in its movements from compression of arm-nerves during sleep,\nstill feel with their fingers; and they may still feel in their feet\nwhen their legs are paralyzed by bruising of the spinal cord. In a\nsimilar way, the motor cortex might be sensitive as well as motor, and\nyet by this greater subtlety (or whatever the peculiarity may be) in\nthe sensory currents, the sensibility might survive an amount of injury\nthere by which the motility was destroyed. Nothnagel considers that\nthere are grounds for supposing the _muscular_ sense to be exclusively\nconnected with the parietal lobe and not with the motor zone. \"Disease\nof this lobe gives pure ataxy without palsy, and of the motor zone\npure palsy without loss of muscular sense.\"[55] He fails, however,\nto convince more competent critics than the present writer,[56] so I\nconclude with them that as yet we have no decisive grounds for locating\nmuscular and cutaneous feeling apart. Much still remains to be learned\nabout the relations between musculo-cutaneous sensibility and the\ncortex, but one thing is certain: that neither the occipital, the\nforward frontal, nor the temporal lobes seem to have anything essential\nto do with it in man. It is knit up with the performances of the\n_motor zone and of the convolutions backwards and midwards of them_.\nThe reader must remember this conclusion when we come to the chapter on\nthe Will.\n*       *       *       *       *\nI must add a word about the connection of aphasia with the tactile\nsense. On p. 40 I spoke of those cases in which the patient can write\nbut not read his own writing. He cannot read by his eyes; but he can\nread by the feeling in his fingers, if he retrace the letters in the\nair. It is convenient for such a patient to have a pen in hand whilst\nreading in this way, in order to make the usual feeling of writing more\ncomplete.[57] In such a case we must suppose that the path between the\noptical and the graphic centres remains open, whilst that between the\noptical and the auditory and articulatory centres is closed. Only thus\ncan we understand how the look of the writing should fail to suggest\nthe sound of the words to the patient's mind, whilst it still suggests\nthe proper movements of graphic imitation. These movements in their\nturn must of course be felt, and the feeling of them must be associated\nwith the centres for hearing and pronouncing the words. The injury in\ncases like this where very special combinations fail, whilst others go\non as usual, must always be supposed to be of the nature of increased\nresistance to the passage of certain currents of association. If any of\nthe _elements_ of mental function were destroyed the incapacity would\nnecessarily be much more formidable. A patient who can both read and\nwrite with his fingers most likely uses an identical 'graphic' centre,\nat once sensory and motor, for both operations.\n*       *       *       *       *\nI have now given, as far as the nature of this book will allow, a\ncomplete account of the present state of the localization-question.\nIn its main outlines it stands firm, though much has still to be\ndiscovered. The anterior frontal lobes, for example, so far as is yet\nknown, have no definite functions. Goltz finds that dogs bereft of them\nboth are incessantly in motion, and excitable by every small stimulus.\nThey are irascible and amative in an extraordinary degree, and their\nsides grow bare with perpetual reflex scratching; but they show no\n_local_ troubles of either motion or sensibility. In monkeys not even\nthis lack of inhibitory ability is shown, and neither stimulation nor\nexcision of the prefrontal lobes produces any symptoms whatever. One\nmonkey of Horsley and Schaefer's was as tame, and did certain tricks as\nwell, after as before the operation.[58] It is probable that we have\nabout reached the limits of what can be learned about brain-functions\nfrom vivisecting inferior animals, and that we must hereafter look more\nexclusively to human pathology for light. The existence of separate\nspeech and writing centres in the left hemisphere in man; the fact\nthat palsy from cortical injury is so much more complete and enduring\nin man and the monkey than in dogs; and the farther fact that it seems\nmore difficult to get complete sensorial blindness from cortical\nablations in the lower animals than in man, all show that functions get\nmore specially localized as evolution goes on. In birds localization\nseems hardly to exist, and in rodents it is much less conspicuous than\nin carnivora. Even for man, however, Munk's way of mapping out the\ncortex into absolute areas within which only one movement or sensation\nis represented is surely false. The truth seems to be rather that,\nalthough there is a correspondence of certain regions of the brain to\ncertain regions of the body, yet the several _parts_ within each bodily\nregion are represented throughout the _whole_ of the corresponding\nbrain-region like pepper and salt sprinkled from the same caster. This,\nhowever, does not prevent each 'part' from having its _focus_ at one\nspot within the brain-region. The various brain-regions merge into each\nother in the same mixed way. As Mr. Horsley says: \"There are border\ncentres, and the area of representation of the face merges into that\nfor the representation of the upper limb. If there was a focal lesion\nat that point, you would have the movements of these two parts starting\ntogether.\"[59] The accompanying figure from Paneth shows just how the\nmatter stands in the dog.[60]\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Dog's motor centres, right hemisphere,\naccording to Paneth.--The points of the motor region are correlated as\nfollows with muscles: the _loops_ with the _orbicularis palpebrarum_;\nthe _plain crosses_ with the _flexor_, the _crosses inscribed in\ncircles_ with the _extensor, digitorum communis_ of the fore-paw;\nthe _plain circles_ with the _abductor pollicis longus_; the _double\ncrosses_ with the _extensor communis_ of the hind-limb.]\nI am speaking now of localizations breadthwise over the brain-surface.\nIt is conceivable that there might be also localizations depthwise\nthrough the cortex. The more superficial cells are smaller, the deepest\nlayer of them is large; and it has been suggested that the superficial\ncells are sensorial, the deeper ones motor;[61] or that the superficial\nones in the motor region are correlated with the extremities of the\norgans to be moved (fingers, etc.), the deeper ones with the more\ncentral segments (wrist, elbow, etc.).[62] It need hardly be said that\nall such theories are as yet but guesses.\nWe thus see that the postulate of Meynert and Jackson which we started\nwith on p. 30 is on the whole most satisfactorily corroborated by\nsubsequent objective research. _The highest centres do probably\ncontain nothing but arrangements for representing impressions and\nmovements, and other arrangements for coupling the activity Of these\narrangements together._[63] Currents pouring in from the sense-organs\nfirst excite some arrangements, which in turn excite others, until\nat last a motor discharge downwards of some sort occurs. When this is\nonce clearly grasped there remains little ground for keeping up that\nold controversy about the motor zone, as to whether it is in reality\nmotor or sensitive. The whole cortex, inasmuch as currents run through\nit, is both. All the currents probably have feelings going with them,\nand sooner or later bring movements about. In one aspect, then,\nevery centre is afferent, in another efferent, even the motor cells\nof the spinal cord having these two aspects inseparably conjoined.\nMarique,[64] and Exner and Paneth[65] have shown that by cutting\n_round_ a 'motor' centre and so separating it from the influence of\nthe rest of the cortex, the same disorders are produced as by cutting\nit out, so that really it is only the mouth of the funnel, as it were,\nthrough which the stream of innervation, starting from elsewhere,\npours;[66] consciousness accompanying the stream, and being mainly of\nthings seen if the stream is strongest occipitally, of things heard\nif it is strongest temporally, of things felt, etc., if the stream\noccupies most intensely the 'motor zone.' It seems to me that some\nbroad and vague formulation like this is as much as we can safely\nventure on in the present state of science; and in subsequent chapters\nI expect to give confirmatory reasons for my view.\nMAN'S CONSCIOUSNESS LIMITED TO THE HEMISPHERES.\n_But is the consciousness which accompanies the activity of the cortex\nthe only consciousness that man has?_ or _are his lower centres\nconscious as well?_\nThis is a difficult question to decide, how difficult one only learns\nwhen one discovers that the cortex-consciousness itself of certain\nobjects can be seemingly annihilated in any good hypnotic subject by a\nbare wave of his operator's hand, and yet be proved by circumstantial\nevidence to exist all the while in a split-off condition, quite as\n'ejective'[67] to the rest of the subject's mind as that mind is to\nthe mind of the bystanders.[68] The lower centres themselves may\nconceivably all the while have a split-off consciousness of their\nown, similarly ejective to the cortex-consciousness; but whether\nthey have it or not can never be known from merely introspective\nevidence. Meanwhile the fact that occipital destruction in man may\ncause a blindness which is apparently absolute (no feeling remaining\neither of light or dark over one half of the field of view), would\nlead us to suppose that if our lower optical centres, the corpora\nquadrigemina, and thalami, do have any consciousness, it is at all\nevents a consciousness which does not mix with that which accompanies\nthe cortical activities, and which has nothing to do with our personal\nSelf. In lower animals this may not be so much the case. The traces of\nsight found (supra, p. 46) in dogs and monkeys whose occipital lobes\nwere entirely destroyed, may possibly have been due to the fact that\nthe lower centres of these animals saw, and that what they saw was\nnot ejective but objective to the remaining cortex, i.e. it formed\npart of one and the same inner world with the things which that cortex\nperceived. It may be, however, that the phenomena were due to the fact\nthat in these animals the cortical 'centres' for vision reach outside\nof the occipital zone, and that destruction of the latter fails to\nremove them as completely as in man. This, as we know, is the opinion\nof the experimenters themselves. For practical purposes, nevertheless,\nand limiting the meaning of the word consciousness to the personal\nself of the individual, we can pretty confidently answer the question\nprefixed to this paragraph by saying that _the cortex is the sole organ\nof consciousness in man_.[69] If there be any consciousness pertaining\nto the lower centres, it is a consciousness of which the self knows\nnothing.\nTHE RESTITUTION OF FUNCTION.\nAnother problem, not so metaphysical, remains. The most general\nand striking fact connected with cortical injury is that of the\n_restoration of function_. Functions lost at first are after a few days\nor weeks restored. _How are we to understand this restitution?_\nTwo theories are in the field:\n1) Restitution is due to the vicarious action either of the rest of the\ncortex or of centres lower down, acquiring functions which until then\nthey had not performed;\n2) It is due to the remaining centres (whether cortical or 'lower')\nresuming functions which they had always had, but of which the wound\nhad temporarily inhibited the exercise. This is the view of which Goltz\nand Brown-S\u00e9quard are the most distinguished defenders.\nInhibition is a _vera causa_, of that there can be no doubt. The\npneumogastric nerve inhibits the heart, the splanchnic inhibits the\nintestinal movements, and the superior laryngeal those of inspiration.\nThe nerve-irritations which may inhibit the contraction of arterioles\nare innumerable, and reflex actions are often repressed by the\nsimultaneous excitement of other sensory nerves. For all such facts the\nreader must consult the treatises on physiology. What concerns us here\nis the inhibition exerted by different parts of the nerve-centres, when\nirritated, on the activity of distant parts. The flaccidity of a frog\nfrom 'shock,' for a minute or so after his medulla oblongata is cut, is\nan inhibition from the seat of injury which quickly passes away.\nWhat is known as 'surgical shock '(unconsciousness, pallor, dilatation\nof splanchnic blood-vessels, and general syncope and collapse) in\nthe human subject is an inhibition which lasts a longer time. Goltz,\nFreusberg, and others, cutting the spinal cord in dogs, proved that\nthere were functions inhibited still longer by the wound, but which\nre-established themselves ultimately if the animal was kept alive.\nThe lumbar region of the cord was thus found to contain independent\nvaso-motor centres, centres for erection, for control of the\nsphincters, etc., which could be excited to activity by tactile stimuli\nand as readily reinhibited by others simultaneously applied.[70]\nWe may therefore plausibly suppose that the rapid reappearance of\nmotility, vision, etc., after their first disappearance in consequence\nof a cortical mutilation, is due to the passing off of inhibitions\nexerted by the irritated surface of the wound. The only question is\nwhether _all_ restorations of function must be explained in this\none simple way, or whether some part of them may not be owing to\nthe formation of entirely new paths in the remaining centres, by\nwhich they become 'educated' to duties which they did not originally\npossess. In favor of an indefinite extension of the inhibition theory\nfacts may be cited such as the following: In dogs whose disturbances\ndue to cortical lesion have disappeared, they may in consequence of\nsome inner or outer accident reappear in all their intensity for 24\nhours or so and then disappear again.[71] In a dog made half blind\nby an operation, and then shut up in the dark, vision comes back\njust as quickly as in other similar dogs whose sight is exercised\nsystematically every day.[72] A dog which has learned to beg before\nthe operation recommences this practice quite _spontaneously_ a week\nafter a double-sided ablation of the motor zone.[73] Occasionally,\nin a pigeon (or even, it is said, in a dog) we see the disturbances\nless marked immediately after the operation than they are half an hour\nlater.[74] This would be impossible were they due to the subtraction of\nthe organs which normally carried them on. Moreover the entire drift of\nrecent physiological and pathological speculation is towards enthroning\ninhibition as an ever-present and indispensable condition of orderly\nactivity. We shall see how great is its importance, in the chapter on\nthe Will. Mr. Charles Mercier considers that no muscular contraction,\nonce begun, would ever stop without it, short of exhaustion of the\nsystem;[75] and Brown-S\u00e9quard has for years been accumulating examples\nto show how far its influence extends.[76] Under these circumstances it\nseems as if error might more probably lie in curtailing its sphere too\nmuch than in stretching it too far as an explanation of the phenomena\nfollowing cortical lesion.[77]\nOn the other hand, if we admit _no_ re-education of centres, we\nnot only fly in the face of an _a priori_ probability, but we find\nourselves compelled by facts to suppose an almost incredible number of\nfunctions natively lodged in the centres below the _thalami_ or even in\nthose below the _corpora quadrigemina_. I will consider the _a priori_\nobjection after first taking a look at the facts which I have in mind.\nThey confront us the moment we ask ourselves just _which are the parts\nwhich perform the functions abolished by an operation after sufficient\ntime has elapsed for restoration to occur?_\nThe first observers thought that they must be the _corresponding parts\nof the opposite or intact hemisphere_. But as long ago as 1875 Carville\nand Duret tested this by cutting out the fore-leg-centre on one side,\nin a dog, and then, after waiting till restitution had occurred,\ncutting it out on the opposite side as well. Goltz and others have\ndone the same thing.[78] If the opposite side were really the seat of\nthe restored function, the original palsy should have appeared again\nand been permanent. But it did not appear at all; there appeared only\na palsy of the hitherto unaffected side. The next supposition is that\n_the parts surrounding the cut-out region_ learn vicariously to perform\nits duties. But here, again, experiment seems to upset the hypothesis,\nso far as the motor zone goes at least; for we may wait till motility\nhas returned in the affected limb, and then both irritate the cortex\nsurrounding the wound without exciting the limb to movement, and ablate\nit, without bringing back the vanished palsy.[79] It would accordingly\nseem that _the cerebral centres below the cortex_ must be the seat\nof the regained activities. But Goltz destroyed a dog's entire left\nhemisphere, together with the _corpus striatum_ and the _thalamus_\non that side, and kept him alive until a surprisingly small amount\nof motor and tactile disturbance remained.[80] These centres cannot\nhere have accounted for the restitution. He has even, as it would\nappear,[81] ablated both the hemispheres of a dog, and kept him alive\n51 days, able to walk and stand. The corpora striata and thalami in\nthis dog were also practically gone. In view of such results we seem\ndriven, with M. Fran\u00e7ois-Franck,[82] to fall back on the _ganglia lower\nstill_, or even on the _spinal cord_ as the 'vicarious' organ of which\nwe are in quest. If the abeyance of function between the operation\nand the restoration was due _exclusively_ to inhibition, then we must\nsuppose these lowest centres to be in reality extremely accomplished\norgans. They must always have done what we now find them doing after\nfunction is restored, even when the hemispheres were intact. Of course\nthis is conceivably the case; yet it does not seem very plausible. And\nthe _a priori_ considerations which a moment since I said I should\nurge, make it less plausible still.\nFor, in the first place, the brain is essentially a place of currents,\nwhich run in organized paths. Loss of function can only mean one of\ntwo things, either that a current can no longer run in, or that if it\nruns in, it can no longer run out, by its old path. Either of these\ninabilities may come from a local ablation; and 'restitution' can then\nonly mean that, in spite of a temporary block, an inrunning current has\nat last become enabled to flow out by its old path again--e.g., the\nsound of 'give your paw' discharges after some weeks into the same\ncanine muscles into which it used to discharge before the operation. As\nfar as the cortex itself goes, since one of the purposes for which it\nactually exists is the production of new paths,[83] the only question\nbefore us is: Is the formation of _these particular 'vicarious'\npaths_ too much to expect of its plastic powers? It would certainly\nbe too much to expect that a hemisphere should receive currents\nfrom optic fibres whose _arriving-place_ within it is destroyed,\nor that it should discharge into fibres of the pyramidal strand if\ntheir _place of exit_ is broken down. Such lesions as these must be\nirreparable _within that hemisphere_. Yet even then, through the other\nhemisphere, the _corpus callosum_, and the bilateral connections in\nthe spinal cord, one can imagine some road by which the old muscles\nmight eventually be innervated by the same incoming currents which\ninnervated them before the block. And for all minor interruptions,\nnot involving the arriving-place of the 'cortico-petal' or the place\nof exit of the 'cortico-fugal' fibres, roundabout paths of some sort\nthrough the affected hemisphere itself must exist, for every point\nof it is, remotely at least, in potential communication with every\nother point. The normal paths are only paths of least resistance. If\nthey get blocked or cut, paths formerly more resistant become the\nleast resistant paths under the changed conditions. It must never be\nforgotten that a current that runs in has got to run out _somewhere_;\nand if it only once succeeds by accident in striking into its old place\nof exit again, the thrill of satisfaction which the consciousness\nconnected with the whole residual brain then receives will reinforce\nand fix the paths of that moment and make them more likely to be struck\ninto again. The resultant feeling that the old habitual act is at last\nsuccessfully back again, becomes itself a new stimulus which stamps all\nthe existing currents in. It is matter of experience that such feelings\nof successful achievement do tend to fix in our memory whatever\nprocesses have led to them; and we shall have a good deal more to say\nupon the subject when we come to the Chapter on the Will.\nMy conclusion then is this: that some of the restitution of function\n(especially where the cortical lesion is not too great) is probably due\nto genuinely vicarious function on the part of the centres that remain;\nwhilst some of it is due to the passing off of inhibitions. In other\nwords, both the vicarious theory and the inhibition theory are true in\ntheir measure. But as for determining that measure, or saying which\ncentres are vicarious, and to what extent they can learn new tricks,\nthat is impossible at present.\nFINAL CORRECTION OF THE MEYNERT SCHEME.\nAnd now, after learning all these facts, what are we to think of the\nchild and the candle-flame, and of that scheme which provisionally\nimposed itself on our acceptance after surveying the actions of the\nfrog? (_Cf_. pp. 25-6, _supra_.) It will be remembered that we then\nconsidered the lower centres _en masse_ as machines for responding to\npresent sense-impressions exclusively, and the hemispheres as equally\nexclusive organs of action from inward considerations or ideas; and\nthat, following Meynert, we supposed the hemispheres to have no native\ntendencies to determinate activity, but to be merely superadded organs\nfor breaking up the various reflexes performed by the lower centres,\nand combining their motor and sensory elements in novel ways. It will\nalso be remembered that I prophesied that we should be obliged to\nsoften down the sharpness of this distinction after we had completed\nour survey of the farther facts. The time has now come for that\ncorrection to be made.\nWider and completer observations show us both that the lower centres\nare more spontaneous, and that the hemispheres are more automatic,\nthan the Meynert scheme allows. Schrader's observations in Goltz's\nLaboratory on hemisphereless frogs[84] and pigeons[85] give an\nidea quite different from the picture of these creatures which is\nclassically current. Steiner's[86] observations on frogs already\nwent a good way in the same direction, showing, for example, that\nlocomotion is a well-developed function of the medulla oblongata. But\nSchrader, by great care in the operation, and by keeping the frogs\na long time alive, found that at least in some of them the spinal\ncord would produce movements of locomotion when the frog was smartly\nroused by a poke, and that swimming and croaking could sometimes be\nperformed when nothing above the medulla oblongata remained.[87]\nSchrader's hemisphereless frogs moved spontaneously, ate flies, buried\nthemselves in the ground, and in short did many things which before\nhis observations were supposed to be impossible unless the hemispheres\nremained. Steiner[88] and Vulpian have remarked an even greater\nvivacity in fishes deprived of their hemispheres. Vulpian says of his\nbrainless carps[89] that three days after the operation one of them\ndarted at food and at a knot tied on the end of a string, holding\nthe latter so tight between his jaws that his head was drawn out of\nwater. Later, \"they see morsels of white of egg; the moment these\nsink through the water in front of them, they follow and seize them,\nsometimes after they are on the bottom, sometimes before they have\nreached it. In capturing and swallowing this food they execute just the\nsame movements as the intact carps which are in the same aquarium. The\nonly difference is that they seem to see them at less distance, seek\nthem with less impetuosity and less perseverance in all the points of\nthe bottom of the aquarium, but they struggle (so to speak) sometimes\nwith the sound carps to grasp the morsels. It is certain that they do\nnot confound these bits of white of egg with other white bodies, small\npebbles for example, which are at the bottom of the water. The same\ncarp which, three days after operation, seized the knot on a piece of\nstring, no longer snaps at it now, but if one brings it near her, she\ndraws away from it by swimming backwards before it comes into contact\nwith her mouth.\"[90] Already on pp. 9-10, as the reader may remember,\nwe instanced those adaptations of conduct to new conditions, on the\npart of the frog's spinal cord and thalami, which led Pfl\u00fcger and Lewes\non the one hand and Goltz on the other to locate in these organs an\nintelligence akin to that of which the hemispheres are the seat.\nWhen it comes to birds deprived of their hemispheres, the evidence\nthat some of their acts have conscious purpose behind them is quite\nas persuasive. In pigeons Schrader found that the state of somnolence\nlasted only three or four days, after which time the birds began\nindefatigably to walk about the room. They climbed out of boxes in\nwhich they were put, jumped over or flew up upon obstacles, and their\nsight was so perfect that neither in walking nor flying did they\never strike any object in the room. They had also definite ends or\npurposes, flying straight for more convenient perching places when\nmade uncomfortable by movements imparted to those on which they stood;\nand of several possible perches they always chose the most convenient.\n\"If we give the dove the choice of a horizontal bar (_Reck_) or an\nequally distant table to fly to, she always gives decided preference to\nthe table. Indeed she chooses the table even if it is several meters\nfarther off than the bar or the chair.\" Placed on the back of a chair,\nshe flies first to the seat and then to the floor, and in general\n\"will forsake a high position, although it give her sufficiently\nfirm support, and in order to reach the ground will make use of the\nenvironing objects as intermediate goals of flight, showing a perfectly\ncorrect judgment of their distance. Although able to fly directly to\nthe ground, she prefers to make the journey in successive stages....\nOnce on the ground, she hardly ever rises spontaneously into the\nair.\"[91]\nYoung rabbits deprived of their hemispheres will stand, run, start\nat noises, avoid obstacles in their path, and give responsive cries\nof suffering when hurt. Rats will do the same, and throw themselves\nmoreover into an attitude of defence. Dogs never survive such an\noperation if performed at once. But Goltz's latest dog, mentioned\non p. 70, which is said to have been kept alive for fifty-one days\nafter both hemispheres had been removed by a series of ablations and\nthe corpora striata and thalami had softened away, shows how much the\nmid-brain centres and the cord can do even in the canine species.\nTaken together, the number of reactions shown to exist in the lower\ncentres by these observations make out a pretty good case for the\nMeynert scheme, as applied to these lower animals. That scheme demands\nhemispheres which shall be mere supplements or organs of repetition,\nand in the light of these observations they obviously are so to a great\nextent. But the Meynert scheme also demands that the reactions of the\nlower centres shall all be _native_, and we are not absolutely sure\nthat some of those which we have been considering may not have been\nacquired after the injury; and it furthermore demands that they should\nbe machine-like, whereas the expression of some of them makes us doubt\nwhether they may not be guided by an intelligence of low degree.\nEven in the lower animals, then, there is reason to soften down that\nopposition between the hemispheres and the lower centres which the\nscheme demands. The hemispheres may, it is true, only supplement the\nlower centres, but the latter resemble the former in nature and have\nsome small amount at least of 'spontaneity' and choice.\nBut when we come to monkeys and man the scheme well-nigh breaks down\naltogether; for we find that the hemispheres do not simply repeat\nvoluntarily actions which the lower centres perform as machines.\nThere are many functions which the lower centres cannot by themselves\nperform at all. When the motor cortex is injured in a man or a monkey\ngenuine paralysis ensues, which in man is incurable, and almost or\nquite equally so in the ape. Dr. Seguin knew a man with hemi-blindness,\nfrom cortical injury, which had persisted unaltered for twenty-three\nyears. 'Traumatic inhibition' cannot possibly account for this. The\nblindness must have been an 'Ausfallserscheinung,' due to the loss\nof vision's essential organ. It would seem, then, that in these\nhigher creatures the lower centres must be less adequate than they\nare farther down in the zoological scale; and that even for certain\nelementary combinations of movement and impression the co-operation\nof the hemispheres is necessary from the start. Even in birds and dogs\nthe power of _eating properly_ is lost when the frontal lobes are cut\noff.[92]\nThe plain truth is that neither in man nor beast are the hemispheres\nthe virgin organs which our scheme called them. So far from being\nunorganized at birth, they must have native tendencies to reaction\nof a determinate sort.[93] These are the tendencies which we know as\n_emotions_ and _instincts_, and which we must study with some detail in\nlater chapters of this book. Both instincts and emotions are reactions\nupon special sorts of objects of _perception_; they depend on the\nhemispheres; and they are in the first instance reflex, that is, they\ntake place the first time the exciting object is met, are accompanied\nby no forethought or deliberation, and are irresistible. But they are\nmodifiable to a certain extent by experience, and on later occasions\nof meeting the exciting object, the instincts especially have less of\nthe blind impulsive character which they had at first. All this will be\nexplained at some length in Chapter XXIV. Meanwhile we can say that the\nmultiplicity of emotional and instinctive reactions in man, together\nwith his extensive associative power, permit of extensive recouplings\nof the original sensory and motor partners. The _consequences_ of one\ninstinctive reaction often prove to be the inciters of an opposite\nreaction, and being _suggested_ on later occasions by the original\nobject, may then suppress the first reaction altogether, just as in the\ncase of the child and the flame. For this education the hemispheres do\nnot need to be _tabul\u00e6 ras\u00e6_ at first, as the Meynert scheme would\nhave them; and so far from their being educated by the lower centres\nexclusively, they educate themselves.[94]\nWe have already noticed the absence of reactions from fear and hunger\nin the ordinary brainless frog. Schrader gives a striking account of\nthe instinctless condition of his brainless pigeons, active as they\nwere in the way of locomotion and voice. \"The hemisphereless animal\nmoves in a world of bodies which ... are all of equal value for him....\nHe is, to use Goltz's apt expression, _impersonal_.... Every object is\nfor him only a space-occupying mass, he turns out of his path for an\nordinary pigeon no otherwise than for a stone. He may try to climb over\nboth. All authors agree that they never found any difference, whether\nit was an inanimate body, a cat, a dog, or a bird of prey which came\nin their pigeon's way. The creature knows neither friends nor enemies,\nin the thickest company it lives like a hermit. The languishing cooing\nof the male awakens no more impression than the rattling of the peas,\nor the call-whistle which in the days before the injury used to make\nthe birds hasten to be fed. Quite as little as the earlier observers\nhave I seen hemisphereless she-birds answer the courting of the male.\nA hemisphereless male will coo all day long and show distinct signs\nof sexual excitement, but his activity is without any object, it is\nentirely indifferent to him whether the she-bird be there or not. If\none is placed near him, he leaves her unnoticed.... As the male pays\nno attention to the female, so she pays none to her young. The brood\nmay follow the mother ceaselessly calling for food, but they might as\nwell ask it from a stone.... The hemisphereless sphereless pigeon is\nin the highest degree tame, and fears man as little as cat or bird of\nprey.\"[95]\nPutting together now all the facts and reflections which we have been\nthrough, it seems to me that _we can no longer hold strictly to the\nMeynert scheme_. If anywhere, it will apply to the lowest animals;\nbut in them especially the lower centres seem to have a degree of\nspontaneity and choice. On the whole, I think that we are driven to\nsubstitute for it some such general conception as the following, which\nallows for zoological differences as we know them, and is vague and\nelastic enough to receive any number of future discoveries of detail.\nCONCLUSION.\nAll the centres, in all animals, whilst they are in one aspect\nmechanisms, probably are, or at least once were, organs of\nconsciousness in another, although the consciousness is doubtless\nmuch more developed in the hemispheres than it is anywhere else. The\nconsciousness must everywhere _prefer_ some of the sensations which it\ngets to others; and if it can remember these in their absence, however\ndimly, they must be its _ends_ of desire. If, moreover, it can identify\nin memory any motor discharges which may have led to such ends, and\nassociate the latter with them, then these motor discharges themselves\nmay in turn become desired as _means_. This is the development of\n_will_; and its realization must of course be proportional to the\npossible complication of the consciousness. Even the spinal cord\nmay possibly have some little power of will in this sense, and of\neffort towards modified behavior in consequence of new experiences of\nsensibility.[96]\nAll nervous centres have then in the first instance one essential\nfunction, that of 'intelligent' action. They feel, prefer one thing to\nanother, and have 'ends.' Like all other organs, however, they _evolve_\nfrom ancestor to descendant, and their evolution takes two directions,\nthe lower centres passing downwards into more unhesitating automatism,\nand the higher ones upwards into larger intellectuality.[97] Thus it\nmay happen that those functions which can safely grow uniform and fatal\nbecome least accompanied by mind, and that their organ, the spinal\ncord, becomes a more and more soulless machine; whilst on the contrary\nthose functions which it benefits the animal to have adapted to\ndelicate environing variations pass more and more to the hemispheres,\nwhose anatomical structure and attendant consciousness grow more and\nmore elaborate as zoological evolution proceeds. In this way it might\ncome about that in man and the monkeys the basal ganglia should do\nfewer things by themselves than they can do in dogs, fewer in dogs\nthan in rabbits, fewer in rabbits than in hawks,[98] fewer in hawks\nthan in pigeons, fewer in pigeons than in frogs, fewer in frogs than\nin fishes, and that the hemispheres should correspondingly do more.\nThis passage of functions forward to the ever-enlarging hemispheres\nwould be itself one of the evolutive changes, to be explained like\nthe development of the hemispheres themselves, either by fortunate\nvariation or by inherited effects of use. The reflexes, on this view,\nupon which the education of our human hemispheres depends, would not\nbe due to the basal ganglia alone. They would be tendencies in the\nhemispheres themselves, modifiable by education, unlike the reflexes of\nthe medulla oblongata, pons, optic lobes and spinal cord. Such cerebral\nreflexes, if they exist, form a basis quite as good as that which the\nMeynert scheme offers, for the acquisition of memories and associations\nwhich may later result in all sorts of 'changes of partners' in the\npsychic world. The diagram of the baby and the candle (see page 25)\ncan be re-edited, if need be, as an entirely cortical transaction. The\noriginal tendency to touch will be a cortical instinct; the burn will\nleave an image in another part of the cortex, which, being recalled\nby association, will inhibit the touching tendency the next time the\ncandle is perceived, and excite the tendency to withdraw--so that the\nretinal picture will, upon that next time, be coupled with the original\nmotor partner of the pain. We thus get whatever psychological truth\nthe Meynert scheme possesses without entangling ourselves on a dubious\nanatomy and physiology.\nSome such shadowy view of the evolution of the centres, of the relation\nof consciousness to them, and of the hemispheres to the other lobes,\nis, it seems to me, that in which it is safest to indulge. If it has no\nother advantage, it at any rate makes us realize how enormous are the\ngaps in our knowledge, the moment we try to cover the facts by any one\nformula of a general kind.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[4] It should be said that this particular cut commonly proves fatal.\nThe text refers to the rare cases which survive.\n[5] I confine myself to the frog for simplicity's sake. In higher\nanimals, especially the ape and man, it would seem as if not only\ndeterminate combinations of muscles, but limited groups or even single\nmuscles could be innervated from the hemispheres.\n[6] I hope that the reader will take no umbrage at my so mixing the\nphysical and mental, and talking of reflex acts and hemispheres\nand reminiscences in the same breath, as if they were homogeneous\nquantities and factors of one causal chain. I have done so\ndeliberately; for although I admit that from the radically physical\npoint of view it is easy to conceive of the chain of events amongst\nthe cells and fibres as complete in itself, and that whilst so\nconceiving it one need make no mention of 'ideas,' I yet suspect that\npoint of view of being an unreal abstraction. Reflexes in centres may\ntake place even where accompanying feelings or ideas guide them. In\nanother chapter I shall try to show reasons for not abandoning this\ncommon-sense position; meanwhile language lends itself so much more\neasily to the mixed way of describing, that I will continue to employ\nthe latter. The more radical-minded reader can always read 'ideational\nprocess' for 'idea.'\n[7] I shall call it hereafter for shortness 'the Meynert scheme;' for\nthe child-and-flame example, as well as the whole general notion that\nthe hemispheres are a supernumerary surface for the projection and\nassociation of sensations and movements natively coupled in the centres\nbelow, is due to Th. Meynert, the Austrian anatomist. For a popular\naccount of his views, see his pamphlet 'Zur Mechanik des Gehirnbaues,'\nVienna, 1874. His most recent development of them is embodied in\nhis 'Psychiatry,' a clinical treatise on diseases of the forebrain,\ntranslated by B. Sachs, New York, 1885.\n[8] Geschichte des Materialismus, 2d ed., ii, p. 345.\n[9] West Riding Asylum Reports, 1876, p. 267.\n[10] For a thorough discussion of the various objections, see Ferrier's\n'Functions of the Brain,' 2d ed., pp. 227-234, and Fran\u00e7ois-Franck's\n'Le\u00e7ons sur les Fonctions Motrices du Cerveau' (1887), Le\u00e7on 31. The\nmost minutely accurate experiments on irritation of cortical points are\nthose of Paneth, in Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vol 37, p. 528.--Recently the\nskull has been fearlessly opened by surgeons, and operations upon the\nhuman brain performed, sometimes with the happiest results.

S. Freund: Archiv f. Psychiatrie,\nvol. xx, the occipital lobes were injured, but their cortex was not\ndestroyed, on both sides. There was still vision. Cf. pp. 291-5.\n[30] I say 'need,' for I do not of course deny the _possible_\ncoexistence of the two symptoms. Many a brain-lesion might block\noptical associations and at the same time impair optical imagination,\nwithout entirely stopping vision. Such a case seems to have been the\nremarkable one from Charcot which I shall give rather fully in the\nchapter on Imagination.\n[31] Freund (in the article cited above 'Ueber optische Aphasie und\nSeelenblindheit') and Bruns ('Ein Fall von Alexie,' etc., in the\nNeurologisches Centralblatt for 1888, pp. 581, 509) explain their\ncases by broken-down conduction. Wilbrand, whose painstaking monograph\non mental blindness was referred to a moment ago, gives none but _a\npriori_ reasons for his belief that the optical 'Erinnerungsfeld' must\nbe locally distinct from the Wahrnehmungsfeld (cf. pp. 84, 93). The _a\npriori_ reasons are really the other way. Mauthner ('Gehirn u. Auge'\n(1881), p. 487 ff.) tries to show that the 'mental blindness' of Munk's\ndogs and apes after occipital mutilation was not such, but real dimness\nof sight.

It is possible that this symptom may be an effect of\ntraumatic inhibition, however.\n[93] A few years ago one of the strongest arguments for the theory that\nthe hemispheres are purely supernumerary was Soltmann's often-quoted\nobservation that in new-born puppies the motor zone of the cortex is\nnot excitable by electricity and only becomes so in the course of a\nfortnight, presumably after the experiences of the lower centres have\neducated it to motor duties. Paneth's later observations, however, seem\nto show that Soltmann may have been misled through overnarcotizing his\nvictims (Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vol. 37, p. 202). In the Neurologisches\nCentralblatt for 1889, p. 513, Bechterew returns to the subject on\nSoltmann's side without, however, noticing Paneth's work.\n[94] M\u00fcnsterberg (Die Willenshandlung, 1888, p. 134) challenges\nMeynert's scheme _in toto_, saying that whilst we have in our personal\nexperience plenty of examples of acts which were at first voluntary\nbecoming secondarily automatic and reflex, we have no conscious\nrecord of a single originally reflex act growing voluntary.--As far\nas conscious record is concerned, we could not possibly have it even\nif the Meynert scheme were wholly true, for the education of the\nhemispheres which that scheme postulates must in the nature of things\nantedate recollection. But it seems to me that M\u00fcnsterberg's rejection\nof the scheme may possibly be correct as regards reflexes from the\n_lower centres_. Everywhere in this department of psychogenesis we are\nmade to feel how ignorant we really are.\n[95] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vol. 44, p. 230-1.\n[96] Naturally, as Schiff long ago pointed out (Lehrb. d. Muskel-u.\nNervenphysiologie, 1859, p. 213 ff.), the 'R\u00fcckenmarksseele,' if it\nnow exist, can have no higher sense-consciousness, for its incoming\ncurrents are solely from the skin. But it may, in its dim way, both\nfeel, prefer, and desire. See, for the view favorable to the text:\nG. H. Lewes, The Physiology of Common Life (1860), chap. ix. Goltz\n(Nervencentren des Frosches 1869, pp. 102-130) thinks that the frog's\ncord has no adaptative power. This may be the case in such experiments\nas his, because the beheaded frog's short span of life does not give\nit time to learn the new tricks asked for. But Rosenthal (Biologisches\nCentralblatt, vol. iv, p. 247) and Mendelssohn (Berlin Akad.\nSitzungsberichte, 1885, p. 107) in their investigations on the simple\nreflexes of the frog's cord, show that there is some adaptation to new\nconditions, inasmuch as when usual paths of conduction are interrupted\nby a cut, new paths are taken. According to Rosenthal, these grow more\npervious (i.e. require a smaller stimulus) in proportion as they are\nmore often traversed.\n[97] Whether this evolution takes place through the inheritance of\nhabits acquired, or through the preservation of lucky variations, is an\nalternative which we need not discuss here. We shall consider it in the\nlast chapter in the book. For our present purpose the _modus operandi_\nof the evolution makes no difference, provided it be admitted to occur.\n[98] See Schrader's Observations, _loc. cit._\nCHAPTER III.\nON SOME GENERAL CONDITIONS OF BRAIN-ACTIVITY.\nThe elementary properties of nerve-tissue on which the brain-functions\ndepend are far from being satisfactorily made out. The scheme that\nsuggests itself in the first instance to the mind, because it is so\nobvious, is certainly false: I mean the notion that each cell stands\nfor an idea or part of an idea, and that the ideas are associated or\n'bound into bundles' (to use a phrase of Locke's) by the fibres. If we\nmake a symbolic diagram on a blackboard, of the laws of association\nbetween ideas, we are inevitably led to draw circles, or closed figures\nof some kind, and to connect them by lines. When we hear that the\nnerve-centres contain cells which send off fibres, we say that Nature\nhas realized our diagram for us, and that the mechanical substratum\nof thought is plain. In _some_ way, it is true, our diagram must be\nrealized in the brain; but surely in no such visible and palpable way\nas we at first suppose.[99] An enormous number of the cellular bodies\nin the hemispheres are fibreless. Where fibres are sent off they soon\ndivide into untraceable ramifications; and nowhere do we see a simple\ncoarse anatomical connection, like a line on the blackboard, between\ntwo cells. Too much anatomy has been found to order for theoretic\npurposes, even by the anatomists; and the popular-science notions of\ncells and fibres are almost wholly wide of the truth. Let us therefore\nrelegate the subject of the _intimate_ workings of the brain to the\nphysiology of the future, save in respect to a few points of which a\nword must now be said. And first of\nTHE SUMMATION OF STIMULI\nin the same nerve-tract. This is a property extremely important for the\nunderstanding of a great many phenomena of the neural, and consequently\nof the mental, life; and it behooves us to gain a clear conception of\nwhat it means before we proceed any farther.\nThe law is this, that _a stimulus which would be inadequate by itself\nto excite a nerve-centre to effective discharge may, by acting with\none or more other stimuli (equally ineffectual by themselves alone)\nbring the discharge about_. The natural way to consider this is as a\nsummation of tensions which at last overcome a resistance. The first of\nthem produce a 'latent excitement' or a 'heightened irritability'--the\nphrase is immaterial so far as practical consequences go; the last is\nthe straw which breaks the camel's back. Where the neural process is\none that has consciousness for its accompaniment, the final explosion\nwould in all cases seem to involve a vivid state of feeling of a more\nor less substantive kind. But there is no ground for supposing that\nthe tensions whilst yet submaximal or outwardly ineffective, may not\nalso have a share in determining the total consciousness present in the\nindividual at the time. In later chapters we shall see abundant reason\nto suppose that they do have such a share, and that without their\ncontribution the fringe of relations which is at every moment a vital\ningredient of the mind's object, would not come to consciousness at all.\nThe subject belongs too much to physiology for the evidence to be cited\nin detail in these pages. I will throw into a note a few references\nfor such readers as may be interested in following it out,[100] and\nsimply say that the direct electrical irritation of the cortical\ncentres sufficiently proves the point. For it was found by the earliest\nexperimenters here that whereas it takes an exceedingly strong current\nto produce any movement when a single induction-shock is used, a rapid\nsuccession of induction-shocks ('faradization') will produce movements\nwhen the current is comparatively weak. A single quotation from an\nexcellent investigation will exhibit this law under further aspects:\n\"If we continue to stimulate the cortex at short intervals with the\nstrength of current which produces the minimal muscular contraction\n[of the dog's digital extensor muscle], the amount of contraction\ngradually increases till it reaches the maximum. Each earlier\nstimulation leaves thus an effect behind it, which increases the\nefficacy of the following one. In this summation of the stimuli....\nthe following points may be noted: 1) Single stimuli entirely\ninefficacious when alone may become efficacious by sufficiently rapid\nreiteration. If the current used is very much less than that which\nprovokes the first beginning of contraction, a very large number of\nsuccessive shocks may be needed before the movement appears--20, 50,\nonce 106 shocks were needed. 2) The summation takes place easily in\nproportion to the shortness of the interval between the stimuli. A\ncurrent too weak to give effective summation when its shocks are\n3 seconds apart will be capable of so doing when the interval is\nshortened to 1 second. 3) Not only electrical irritation leaves a\nmodification which goes to swell the following stimulus, but every\nsort of irritant which can produce a contraction does so. If in any\nway a reflex contraction of the muscle experimented on has been\nproduced, or if it is contracted spontaneously by the animal (as not\nunfrequently happens 'by sympathy,' during a deep inspiration), it is\nfound that an electrical stimulus, until then inoperative, operates\nenergetically if immediately applied.\"[101]\nFurthermore:\n\"In a certain stage of the morphia-narcosis an ineffectively weak\nshock will become powerfully effective, if, immediately before its\napplication to the motor centre, the skin of certain parts of\nthe body is exposed to gentle tactile stimulation.... If, having\nascertained the subminimal strength of current and convinced one's\nself repeatedly of its inefficacy, we draw our hand a single time\nlightly over the skin of the paw whose cortical centre is the object\nof stimulation, we find the current at once strongly effective. The\nincrease of irritability lasts some seconds before it disappears.\nSometimes the effect of a single light stroking of the paw is only\nsufficient to make the previously ineffectual current produce a very\nweak contraction. Repeating the tactile stimulation will then, as a\nrule, increase the contraction's extent.\"[102]\nWe constantly use the summation of stimuli in our practical appeals.\nIf a car-horse balks, the final way of starting him is by applying\na number of customary incitements at once. If the driver uses reins\nand voice, if one bystander pulls at his head, another lashes his\nhind quarters, and the conductor rings the bell, and the dismounted\npassengers shove the car, all at the same moment, his obstinacy\ngenerally yields, and he goes on his way rejoicing. If we are striving\nto remember a lost name or fact, we think of as many 'cues' as\npossible, so that by their joint action they may recall what no one\nof them can recall alone. The sight of a dead prey will often not\nstimulate a beast to pursuit, but if the sight of movement be added to\nthat of form, pursuit occurs. \"Br\u00fccke noted that his brainless hen,\nwhich made no attempt to peck at the grain under her very eyes, began\npecking if the grain were thrown on the ground with force, so as to\nproduce a rattling sound.\"[103] \"Dr. Allen Thomson hatched out some\nchickens on a carpet, where he kept them for several days. They showed\nno inclination to scrape,... but when Dr. Thomson sprinkled a little\ngravel on the carpet,... the chickens immediately began their scraping\nmovements.\"[104] A strange person, and darkness, are both of them\nstimuli to fear and mistrust in dogs (and for the matter of that, in\nmen). Neither circumstance alone may awaken outward manifestations,\nbut together, i.e. when the strange man is met in the dark, the dog\nwill be excited to violent defiance.[105] Street-hawkers well know the\nefficacy of summation, for they arrange themselves in a line upon the\nsidewalk, and the passer often buys from the last one of them, through\nthe effect of the reiterated solicitation, what he refused to buy from\nthe first in the row. Aphasia shows many examples of summation. A\npatient who cannot name an object simply shown him, will name it if he\ntouches as well as sees it, etc.\nInstances of summation might be multiplied indefinitely, but it is\nhardly worth while to forestall subsequent chapters. Those on Instinct,\nthe Stream of Thought, Attention, Discrimination, Association, Memory,\n\u00c6sthetics, and Will, will contain numerous exemplifications of the\nreach of the principle in the purely psychological field.\nREACTION-TIME.\nOne of the lines of experimental investigation most diligently followed\nof late years is that of the ascertainment of the _time occupied by\nnervous events_. Helmholtz led off by discovering the rapidity of\nthe current in the sciatic nerve of the frog. But the methods he\nused were soon applied to the sensory nerves and the centres, and\nthe results caused much popular scientific admiration when described\nas measurements of the 'velocity of thought.' The phrase 'quick as\nthought' had from time immemorial signified all that was wonderful and\nelusive of determination in the line of speed; and the way in which\nScience laid her doomful hand upon this mystery reminded people of the\nday when Franklin first '_eripuit c\u0153lo fulmen_,' foreshadowing the\nreign of a newer and colder race of gods. We shall take up the various\noperations measured, each in the chapter to which it more naturally\npertains. I may say, however, immediately, that the phrase 'velocity\nof _thought_' is misleading, for it is by no means clear in any of the\ncases what particular act of thought occurs during the time which is\nmeasured. 'Velocity of nerve-action' is liable to the same criticism,\nfor in most cases we do not know what particular nerve-processes occur.\nWhat the times in question really represent is the total duration of\ncertain _reactions upon stimuli_. Certain of the conditions of the\nreaction are prepared beforehand; they consist in the assumption of\nthose motor and sensory tensions which we name the expectant state.\nJust what happens during the actual time occupied by the reaction (in\nother words, just what is added to the pre-existent tensions to produce\nthe actual discharge) is not made out at present, either from the\nneural or from the mental point of view.\nThe method is essentially the same in all these investigations. A\nsignal of some sort is communicated to the subject, and at the same\ninstant records itself on a time-registering apparatus. The subject\nthen makes a muscular movement of some sort, which is the 'reaction,'\nand which also records itself automatically. The time found to have\nelapsed between the two records is the total time of that observation.\nThe time-registering instruments are of various types. One type is\nthat of the revolving drum covered with smoked paper, on which one\nelectric pen traces a line which the signal breaks and the 'reaction'\ndraws again; whilst another electric pen (connected with a pendulum\nor a rod of metal vibrating at a known rate) traces alongside of the\nformer line a 'time-line' of which each undulation or link stands\nfor a certain fraction of a second, and against which the break in\nthe reaction-line can be measured. Compare Fig. 21, where the line is\nbroken by the signal at the first arrow, and continued again by the\nreaction at the second. Ludwig's Kymograph, Marey's Chronograph are\ngood examples of this type of instrument.\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\nAnother type of instrument is represented by the stopwatch, of which\nthe most perfect form is Hipp's Chronoscope. The hand on the dial\nmeasures intervals as short as 1/1000 of a second. The signal (by\nan appropriate electric connection) starts it; the reaction stops\nit; and by reading off its initial and terminal positions we have\nimmediately and with no farther trouble the time we seek. A still\nsimpler instrument, though one not very satisfactory in its working,\nis the 'psychodometer' of Exner & Obersteiner, of which I picture a\nmodification devised by my colleague Professor H. P. Bowditch, which\nworks very well.\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Bowditch's Reaction-timer. _F_, tuning-fork\ncarrying a little plate which holds the paper on which the electric pen\n_M_ makes the tracing, and sliding in grooves on the base-board. _P_,\na plug which spreads the prongs of the fork apart when it is pushed\nforward to its extreme limit, and releases them when it is drawn back\nto a certain point. The fork then vibrates, and, its backward movement\ncontinuing, an undulating line is drawn on the smoked paper by the\npen. At _T_ is a tongue fixed to the carriage of the fork, and at _K_\nan electric key which the tongue opens and with which the electric pen\nis connected. At the instant of opening, the pen changes its place and\nthe undulating line is drawn at a different level on the paper. The\nopening can be made to serve as a signal to the reacter in a variety\nof ways, and his reaction can be made to close the pen again, when the\nline returns to its first level. The reaction time = the number of\nundulations traced at the second level.]\nThe manner in which the signal and reaction are connected with the\nchronographic apparatus varies indefinitely in different experiments.\nEvery new problem requires some new electric or mechanical disposition\nof apparatus.[106]\nThe least complicated time-measurement is that known as _simple\nreaction-time_, in which there is but one possible signal and one\npossible movement, and both are known in advance. The movement is\ngenerally the closing of an electric key with the hand. The foot,\nthe jaw, the lips, even the eyelid, have been in turn made organs of\nreaction, and the apparatus has been modified accordingly.[107] The\ntime usually elapsing between stimulus and movement lies between one\nand three tenths of a second, varying according to circumstances which\nwill be mentioned anon.\nThe subject of experiment, whenever the reactions are short and\nregular, is in a state of extreme tension, and feels, when the signal\ncomes, as if _it_ started the reaction, by a sort of fatality, and\nas if no psychic process of perception or volition had a chance to\nintervene. The whole succession is so rapid that perception seems to be\nretrospective, and the time-order of events to be read off in memory\nrather than known at the moment. This at least is my own personal\nexperience in the matter, and with it I find others to agree. The\nquestion is, What happens inside of us, either in brain or mind? and to\nanswer that we must analyze just what processes the reaction involves.\nIt is evident that some time is lost in each of the following stages:\n1. The stimulus excites the peripheral sense-organ adequately for a\ncurrent to pass into the sensory nerve;\n2. The sensory nerve is traversed;\n3. The transformation (or reflection) of the sensory into a motor\ncurrent occurs in the centres;\n4. The spinal cord and motor nerve are traversed;\n5. The motor current excites the muscle to the contracting point.\nTime is also lost, of course, outside the muscle, in the joints, skin,\netc., and between the parts of the apparatus; and when the stimulus\nwhich serves as signal is applied to the skin of the trunk or limbs,\ntime is lost in the sensorial conduction through the spinal cord.\nThe stage marked 3 is the only one that interests us here. The other\nstages answer to purely physiological processes, but stage 3 is\npsycho-physical; that is, it is a higher-central process, and has\nprobably some sort of consciousness accompanying it. What sort?\nWundt has little difficulty in deciding that it is consciousness of\na quite elaborate kind. He distinguishes between two stages in the\nconscious reception of an impression, calling one _perception_, and the\nother _apperception_, and likening the one to the mere entrance of an\nobject into the periphery of the field of vision, and the other to its\ncoming to occupy the focus or point of view. _Inattentive awareness_\nof an object, and _attention_ to it, are, it seems to me, equivalents\nfor perception and apperception, as Wundt uses the words. To these two\nforms of awareness of the impression Wundt adds the conscious volition\nto react, gives to the trio the name of 'psycho-physical' processes,\nand assumes that they actually follow upon each other in the succession\nin which they have been named.[108] So at least I understand him. The\nsimplest way to determine the time taken up by this psycho-physical\nstage No. 3 would be to determine separately the duration of the\nseveral purely physical processes, 1, 2, 4, and 5, and to subtract them\nfrom the total reaction-time. Such attempts have been made.[109] But\nthe data for calculation are too inaccurate for use, and, as Wundt\nhimself admits,[110] the precise duration of stage 3 must at present\nbe left enveloped with that of the other processes, in the total\nreaction-time.\nMy own belief is that no such succession of conscious feelings as\nWundt describes takes place during stage 3. It is a process of central\nexcitement and discharge, with which doubtless some feeling coexists,\nbut _what_ feeling we cannot tell, because it is so fugitive and so\nimmediately eclipsed by the more substantive and enduring memory\nof the impression as it came in, and of the executed movement of\nresponse. Feeling of the impression, attention to it, thought of\nthe reaction, volition to react, _would_, undoubtedly, all be links\nof the process _under other conditions_,[111] and would lead to the\nsame reaction--after an indefinitely longer time. But these other\nconditions are not those of the experiments we are discussing; and it\nis mythological psychology (of which we shall see many later examples)\nto conclude that because two mental processes lead to the same result\nthey must be similar in their inward subjective constitution. The\nfeeling of stage 3 is certainly no articulate perception. It can be\nnothing but the mere sense of a reflex discharge. _The reaction whose\ntime is measured is_, in short, _a reflex action pure and simple, and\nnot a psychic act_. A foregoing psychic condition is, it is true, a\nprerequisite for this reflex action. The preparation of the attention\nand volition; the expectation of the signal and the readiness of the\nhand to move, the instant it shall come; the nervous tension in which\nthe subject waits, are all conditions of the formation in him for the\ntime being of a new path or arc of reflex discharge. The tract from\nthe sense-organ which receives the stimulus, into the motor centre\nwhich discharges the reaction, is already tingling with premonitory\ninnervation, is raised to such a pitch of heightened irritability by\nthe expectant attention, that the signal is instantaneously sufficient\nto cause the overflow.[112] No other tract of the nervous system is,\nat the moment, in this hair-trigger condition. The consequence is\nthat one sometimes responds to a _wrong_ signal, especially if it be\nan impression of the same _kind_ with the signal we expect.[113] But\nif by chance we are tired, or the signal is unexpectedly weak, and\nwe do not react instantly, but only after an express perception that\nthe signal has come, and an express volition, the time becomes quite\ndisproportionately long (a second or more, according to Exner[114]),\nand we feel that the process is in nature altogether different.\nIn fact, the reaction-time experiments are a case to which we can\nimmediately apply what we have just learned about the summation of\nstimuli. 'Expectant attention' is but the subjective name for what\nobjectively is a partial stimulation of a certain pathway, the pathway\nfrom the 'centre' for the signal to that for the discharge. In Chapter\nXI we shall see that all attention involves excitement from within\nof the tract concerned in feeling the objects to which attention is\ngiven. The tract here is the excito-motor arc about to be traversed.\nThe signal is but the spark from without which touches off a train\nalready laid. The performance, under these conditions, exactly\nresembles any reflex action. The only difference is that whilst, in the\nordinarily so-called reflex acts, the reflex arc is a permanent result\nof organic growth, it is here a transient result of previous cerebral\nconditions.[115]\nI am happy to say that since the preceding paragraphs (and the\nnotes thereto appertaining) were written, Wundt has himself become\nconverted to the view which I defend. He now admits that in the\nshortest reactions \"there is neither apperception nor will, but that\nthey are merely _brain-reflexes due to practice_.\"[116] The means of\nhis conversion are certain experiments performed in his laboratory\nby Herr L. Lange,[117] who was led to distinguish between two ways\nof setting the attention in reacting on a signal, and who found that\nthey gave very different time-results. In the '_extreme sensorial_'\nway, as Lange calls it, of reacting, one keeps one's mind as intent\nas possible upon the expected signal, and 'purposely avoids'[118]\nthinking of the movement to be executed; in the '_extreme muscular_'\nway one 'does not think at all'[119] of the signal, but stands as\nready as possible for the movement. The muscular reactions are much\nshorter than the sensorial ones, the average difference being in the\nneighborhood of a tenth of a second. Wundt accordingly calls them\n'shortened reactions' and, with Lange, admits them to be mere reflexes;\nwhilst the sensorial reactions he calls 'complete,' and holds to his\noriginal conception as far as they are concerned. The facts, however,\ndo not seem to me to warrant even this amount of fidelity to the\noriginal Wundtian position. When we begin to react in the 'extreme\nsensorial' way, Lange says that we get times so very long that they\nmust be rejected from the count as non-typical. \"Only after the reacter\nhas succeeded by repeated and conscientious practice in bringing about\nan extremely precise co-ordination of his voluntary impulse with his\nsense-impression do we get times which can be regarded as typical\nsensorial reaction-times.\"[120] Now it seems to me that these excessive\nand 'untypical' times are probably the real 'complete times,' the only\nones in which distinct processes of actual perception and volition\noccur (see above, pp. 88-9). The typical sensorial time which is\nattained by practice is probably another sort of reflex, less perfect\nthan the reflexes prepared by straining one's attention towards the\nmovement.[121] The times are much more variable in the sensorial way\nthan in the muscular. The several muscular reactions differ little\nfrom each other. Only in them does the phenomenon occur of reacting on\na false signal, or of reacting before the signal. Times intermediate\nbetween these two types occur according as the attention fails to turn\nitself exclusively to one of the extremes. It is obvious that Herr\nLange's distinction between the two types of reaction is a highly\nimportant one, and that the 'extreme muscular method,' giving both the\nshortest times and the most constant ones, ought to be aimed at in all\ncomparative investigations. Herr Lange's own muscular time averaged\n0''.123; his sensorial time, 0''.230.\nThese reaction-time experiments are then in no sense measurements of\nthe swiftness of _thought_. Only when we complicate them is there a\nchance for anything like an intellectual operation to occur. They\nmay be complicated in various ways. The reaction may be withheld\nuntil the signal has consciously awakened a distinct idea (Wundt's\ndiscrimination-time, association-time) and then performed. Or there\nmay be a variety of possible signals, each with a different reaction\nassigned to it, and the reacter may be uncertain which one he is about\nto receive. The reaction would then hardly seem to occur without a\npreliminary recognition and choice. We shall see, however, in the\nappropriate chapters, that the discrimination and choice involved in\nsuch a reaction are widely different from the intellectual operations\nof which we are ordinarily conscious under those names. Meanwhile\nthe simple reaction-time remains as the starting point of all these\nsuperinduced complications. It is the fundamental physiological\nconstant in all time-measurements. As such, its own variations have an\ninterest, and must be briefly passed in review.[122]\nThe reaction-time varies with the _individual_ and his _age_. An\nindividual may have it particularly long in respect of signals of one\nsense (Buccola, p. 147), but not of others. Old and uncultivated people\nhave it long (nearly a second, in an old pauper observed by Exner,\nPfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vii, 612-4). Children have it long (half a second,\nHerzen in Buccola, p. 152).\n_Practice_ shortens it to a quantity which is for each individual a\nminimum beyond which no farther reduction can be made. The aforesaid\nold pauper's time was, after much practice, reduced to 0.1866 sec.\n(_loc. cit._ p. 626).\n_Fatigue_ lengthens it.\n_Concentration of attention_ shortens it. Details will be given in the\nchapter on Attention.\nThe _nature of the signal_ makes it vary.[123] Wundt writes:\n\"I found that the reaction-time for impressions on the skin with\nelectric stimulus is less than for true touch-sensations, as the\nfollowing averages show:\nAverage.    Average Variation\nSound                      0.167 sec.  0.0221 sec.\nLight                      0.222 sec.  0.0219 sec.\nElectric skin-sensation    0.201 sec.  0.0115 sec.\nTouch-sensations           0.213 sec.  0.0134 sec.\n\"I here bring together the averages which have been obtained by some\nother observers:\nHirsch.  Hankel.  Exner.\nSound           0.149    0.1505   0.1360\nLight           0.200    0.2246   0.1506\nSkin-sensation  0.182    0.1546   0.1337\"[124]\n_Thermic_ reactions have been lately measured by A. Goldscheider\nand by Vintschgau (1887), who find them slower than reactions from\ntouch. That from heat especially is very slow, more so than from\ncold, the differences (according to Goldscheider) depending on the\nnerve-terminations in the skin.\n_Gustatory_ reactions were measured by Vintschgau. They differed\naccording to the substances used, running up to half a second as a\nmaximum when identification took place. The mere perception of the\npresence of the substance on the tongue varied from 0''.159 to 0''.219\n(Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, xiv, 529).\n_Olfactory_ reactions have been studied by Vintschgau, Buccola, and\nBeaunis. They are slow, averaging about half a second (cf. Beaunis,\nRecherches exp. sur l'Activit\u00e9 C\u00e9r\u00e9brale, 1884, p. 49 ff.).\nIt will be observed that _sound_ is more promptly reacted on than\neither _sight_ or _touch. Taste_ and _smell_ are slower than either.\nOne individual, who reacted to touch upon the tip of the tongue in\n0''.125, took 0''.993 to react upon the taste of quinine applied to\nthe same spot. In another, upon the base of the tongue, the reaction\nto touch being 0''.141, that to sugar was 0''.552 (Vintschgau, quoted\nby Buccola, p. 103). Buccola found the reaction to odors to vary from\n0''.334 to 0''.681, according to the perfume used and the individual.\nThe _intensity of the signal_ makes a difference. The intenser the\nstimulus the shorter the time. Herzen (Grundlinien einer allgem.\nPsychophysiologie, p. 101) compared the reaction from a _corn_ on\nthe toe with that from the skin of the hand of the same subject. The\ntwo places were stimulated simultaneously, and the subject tried to\nreact simultaneously with both hand and foot, but the foot always went\nquickest. When the sound skin of the foot was touched instead of the\ncorn, it was the hand which always reacted first. Wundt tries to show\nthat when the signal is made barely perceptible, the time is probably\nthe same in all the senses, namely, about 0.332'' (Physiol. Psych., 2d\ned., ii, 224).\nWhere the signal is of touch, the place to which it is applied makes\na difference in the resultant reaction-time. G. S. Hall and V. Kries\nfound (Archiv f. Anat. u. Physiol., 1879) that when the finger-tip\nwas the place the reaction was shorter than when the middle of the\nupper arm was used, in spite of the greater length of nerve-trunk\nto be traversed in the latter case. This discovery invalidates the\nmeasurements of the rapidity of transmission of the current in\nhuman nerves, for they are all based on the method of comparing\nreaction-times from places near the root and near the extremity of\na limb. The same observers found that signals seen by the periphery\nof the retina gave longer times than the same signals seen by direct\nvision.\nThe _season_ makes a difference, the time being some hundredths of a\nsecond shorter on cold winter days (Vintschgau _apud_ Exner, Hermann's\nHdbh., p. 270).\n_Intoxicants_ alter the time. _Coffee_ and _tea_ appear to shorten it.\nSmall doses of _wine_ and _alcohol_ first shorten and then lengthen it;\nbut the shortening stage tends to disappear if a large dose be given\nimmediately. This, at least, is the report of two German observers. Dr.\nJ. W. Warren, whose observations are more thorough than any previous\nones, could find no very decided effects from ordinary doses (Journal\nof Physiology, viii, 311). _Morphia_ lengthens the time. _Amyl-nitrite_\nlengthens it, but after the inhalation it may fall to less than the\nnormal. Ether and chloroform lengthen it (for authorities, etc., see\nBuccola, p. 189).\nCertain _diseased states_ naturally lengthen the time.\nThe _hypnotic trance_ has no constant effect, sometimes shortening and\nsometimes lengthening it (Hall, Mind, viii, 170; James, Proc. Am. Soc.\nfor Psych. Research, 246).\nThe time taken to _inhibit_ a movement (e.g. to cease contraction of\njaw-muscles) seems to be about the same as to produce one (Gad, Archiv\nf. (Anat. u.) Physiol., 1887, 468; Orchansky, _ibid._1889, 1885).\nAn immense amount of work has been done on reaction-time, of which\nI have cited but a small part. It is a sort of work which appeals\nparticularly to patient and exact minds, and they have not failed to\nprofit by the opportunity.\nCEREBRAL BLOOD-SUPPLY.\nThe next point to occupy our attention is the _changes of circulation\nwhich accompany cerebral activity_.\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Sphymographic pulse-tracing. _A_, during\nintellectual repose; _B_, during intellectual activity. (Mosso.)]\nAll parts of the cortex, when electrically excited, produce alterations\nboth of respiration and circulation. The blood-pressure rises, as a\nrule, all over the body, no matter where the cortical irritation is\napplied, though the motor zone is the most sensitive region for the\npurpose. Elsewhere the current must be strong enough for an epileptic\nattack to be produced.[125] Slowing and quickening of the heart are\nalso observed, and are independent of the vaso-constrictive phenomenon.\nMosso, using his ingenious 'plethysmograph' as an indicator,\ndiscovered that the blood-supply to the arms diminished during\nintellectual activity, and found furthermore that the arterial tension\n(as shown by the sphygmograph) was increased in these members (see Fig.\n23). So slight an emotion as that produced by the entrance of Professor\nLudwig into the laboratory was instantly followed by a shrinkage of the\narms.[126] The brain itself is an excessively vascular organ, a sponge\nfull of blood, in fact; and another of Mosso's inventions showed that\nwhen less blood went to the arms, more went to the head. The subject\nto be observed lay on a delicately balanced table which could tip\ndownward either at the head or at the foot if the weight of either end\nwere increased. The moment emotional or intellectual activity began\nin the subject, down went the balance at the head-end, in consequence\nof the redistribution of blood in his system. But the best proof of\nthe immediate afflux of blood to the brain during mental activity is\ndue to Mosso's observations on three persons whose brain had been laid\nbare by lesion of the skull. By means of apparatus described in his\nbook,[127] this physiologist was enabled to let the brain-pulse record\nitself directly by a tracing. The intra-cranial blood-pressure rose\nimmediately whenever the subject was spoken to, or when he began to\nthink actively, as in solving a problem in mental arithmetic. Mosso\ngives in his work a large number of reproductions of tracings which\nshow the instantaneity of the change of blood-supply, whenever the\nmental activity was quickened by any cause whatever, intellectual or\nemotional. He relates of his female subject that one day whilst tracing\nher brain-pulse he observed a sudden rise with no apparent outer or\ninner cause. She however confessed to him afterwards that at that\nmoment she had caught sight of a _skull_ on top of a piece of furniture\nin the room, and that this had given her a slight emotion.\nThe fluctuations of the blood supply to the brain were independent\nof respiratory changes,[128] and followed the quickening of mental\nactivity almost immediately. We must suppose a very delicate adjustment\nwhereby the circulation follows the needs of the cerebral activity.\nBlood very likely may rush to each region of the cortex according as\nit is most active, but of this we know nothing. I need hardly say that\nthe activity of the nervous matter is the primary phenomenon, and the\nafflux of blood its secondary consequence. Many popular writers talk\nas if it were the other way about, and as if mental activity were due\nto the afflux of blood. But, as Professor H. N. Martin has well said,\n\"that belief has no physiological foundation whatever; it is even\ndirectly opposed to all that we know of cell life.\"[129] A chronic\npathological congestion may, it is true, have secondary consequences,\nbut the primary congestions which we have been considering _follow_ the\nactivity of the brain-cells by an adaptive reflex vaso-motor mechanism\ndoubtless as elaborate as that which harmonizes blood-supply with\ncell-action in any muscle or gland.\nOf the changes in the cerebral circulation during sleep I will speak in\nthe chapter which treats of that subject.\nCEREBRAL THERMOMETRY.\n_Brain-activity seems accompanied by a local disengagement of heat._\nThe earliest careful work in this direction was by Dr. J. S. Lombard in\n1867. Dr. Lombard's latest results include the records of over 60,000\nobservations.[130] He noted the changes in delicate thermometers and\nelectric piles placed against the scalp in human beings, and found\nthat any intellectual effort, such as computing, composing, reciting\npoetry silently or aloud, and especially that emotional excitement\nsuch as an anger fit, caused a general rise of temperature, which\nrarely exceeded a degree Fahrenheit. The rise was in most cases more\nmarked in the middle region of the head than elsewhere. Strange to\nsay, it was greater in reciting poetry silently than in reciting it\naloud. Dr. Lombard's explanation is that \"in internal recitation an\nadditional portion of energy, which in recitation aloud was converted\ninto nervous and muscular force, now appears as heat.\"[131] I should\nsuggest rather, if we must have a theory, that the surplus of heat\nin recitation to one's self is due to inhibitory processes which are\nabsent when we recite aloud. In the chapter on the Will we shall see\nthat the _simple_ central process is to _speak_ when we think; to\nthink silently involves a check in addition. In 1870 the indefatigable\nSchiff took up the subject, experimenting on live dogs and chickens,\nplunging thermo-electric needles into the substance of their brain,\nto eliminate possible errors from vascular changes in the skin when\nthe thermometers were placed upon the scalp. After habituation was\nestablished, he tested the animals with various sensations, tactile,\noptic, olfactory, and auditory. He found very regularly an immediate\ndeflection of the galvanometer, indicating an abrupt alteration of\nthe intra-cerebral temperature. When, for instance, he presented an\nempty roll of paper to the nose of his dog as it lay motionless, there\nwas a small deflection, but when a piece of meat was in the paper the\ndeflection was much greater. Schiff concluded from these and other\nexperiments that sensorial activity heats the brain-tissue, but he did\nnot try to localize the increment of heat beyond finding that it was\nin both hemispheres, whatever might be the sensation applied.[132] Dr.\nR. W. Amidon in 1880 made a farther step forward, in localizing the\nheat produced by voluntary muscular contractions. Applying a number\nof delicate surface-thermometers simultaneously against the scalp, he\nfound that when different muscles of the body were made to contract\nvigorously for ten minutes or more, different regions of the scalp rose\nin temperature, that the regions were well focalized, and that the\nrise of temperature was often considerably over a Fahrenheit degree.\nAs a result of his investigations he gives a diagram in which numbered\nregions represent the centres of highest temperature for the various\nspecial movements which were investigated. To a large extent they\ncorrespond to the centres for the same movements assigned by Ferrier\nand others on other grounds; only they cover more of the skull.[133]\n_Phosphorus and Thought._\n_Chemical action must of course accompany brain-activity._ But little\ndefinite is known of its exact nature. Cholesterin and creatin are both\nexcrementitious products, and are both found in the brain. The subject\nbelongs to chemistry rather than to psychology, and I only mention it\nhere for the sake of saying a word about a wide-spread popular error\nabout brain-activity and phosphorus. '_Ohne Phosphor, kein Gedanke_,'\nwas a noted war-cry of the 'materialists' during the excitement on that\nsubject which filled Germany in the '60s. The brain, like every other\norgan of the body, contains phosphorus, and a score of other chemicals\nbesides. Why the phosphorus should be picked out as its essence, no one\nknows. It would be equally true to say 'Ohne Wasser kein Gedanke,' or\n'Ohne Kochsalz kein Gedanke'; for thought would stop as quickly if the\nbrain should dry up or lose its NaCl as if it lost its phosphorus. In\nAmerica the phosphorus-delusion has twined itself round a saying quoted\n(rightly or wrongly) from Professor L. Agassiz, to the effect that\nfishermen are more intelligent than farmers because they eat so much\nfish, which contains so much phosphorus. All the facts may be doubted.\nThe only straight way to ascertain the importance of phosphorus to\nthought would be to find whether more is excreted by the brain during\nmental activity than during rest. Unfortunately we cannot do this\ndirectly, but can only gauge the amount of PO_{5} in the urine, which\nrepresents other organs as well as the brain, and this procedure,\nas Dr. Edes says, is like measuring the rise of water at the mouth\nof the Mississippi to tell where there has been a thunder-storm\nin Minnesota.[134] It has been adopted, however, by a variety of\nobservers, some of whom found the phosphates in the urine diminished,\nwhilst others found them increased, by intellectual work. On the whole,\nit is impossible to trace any constant relation. In maniacal excitement\nless phosphorus than usual seems to be excreted. More is excreted\nduring sleep. There are differences between the alkaline and earthy\nphosphates into which I will not enter, as my only aim is to show that\nthe popular way of looking at the matter has no exact foundation.[135]\nThe fact that phosphorus-preparations may do good in nervous exhaustion\nproves nothing as to the part played by phosphorus in mental activity.\nLike iron, arsenic, and other remedies it is a stimulant or tonic, of\nwhose intimate workings in the system we know absolutely nothing, and\nwhich moreover does good in an extremely small number of the cases in\nwhich it is prescribed.\nThe phosphorus-philosophers have often compared thought to a secretion.\n\"The brain secretes thought, as the kidneys secrete urine, or as the\nliver secretes bile,\" are phrases which one sometimes hears. The lame\nanalogy need hardly be pointed out. The materials which the brain\n_pours into the blood_ (cholesterin, creatin, xanthin, or whatever they\nmay be) are the analogues of the urine and the bile, being in fact real\nmaterial excreta. As far as these matters go, the brain is a ductless\ngland. But we know of nothing connected with liver-and kidney-activity\nwhich can be in the remotest degree compared with the stream of\nthought that accompanies the brain's material secretions.\nThere remains another feature of general brain-physiology, and indeed\nfor psychological purposes the most important feature of all. I refer\nto the aptitude of the brain for acquiring _habits_. But I will treat\nof that in a chapter by itself.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[99] I shall myself in later places indulge in much of this\nschematization. The reader will understand once for all that it is\nsymbolic; and that the use of it is hardly more than to show what\na deep congruity there is between mental processes and mechanical\nprocesses of _some_ kind, not necessarily of the exact kind portrayed.\n[100] Valentin: Archiv f. d. gesammt.

Fowler; Some Observations on the Mental State of the Blind, and\nDeaf, and Dumb (Salisbury, 1843), p. 14.)\n[106] The reader will find a great deal about chronographic apparatus\nin J. Marey: La M\u00e9thode Graphique, pt. ii, chap. ii. One can make\npretty fair measurements with no other instrument than a watch, by\nmaking a large number of reactions, each serving as a signal for\nthe following one, and dividing the total time they take by their\nnumber. Dr. O. W. Holmes first suggested this method, which has been\ningeniously elaborated and applied by Professor Jastrow. See 'Science'\nfor September 10, 1886.\n[107] See, for a few modifications, Cattell, Mind, xi, 220 ff.\n[108] Physiol. Psych., ii, 221-2. Cf. also the first edition, 728-9.\nI must confess to finding all Wundt's utterances about 'apperception'\nboth vacillating and obscure. I see no use whatever for the word, as he\nemploys it, in Psychology. Attention, perception, conception, volition,\nare its ample equivalents. Why we should need a single word to denote\nall these things by turns, Wundt fails to make clear. Consult, however,\nhis pupil Staude's article, 'Ueber den Begriff der Apperception,' etc.,\nin Wundt's periodical Philosophische Studien, i, 149, which may be\nsupposed official. For a minute criticism of Wundt's 'apperception,'\nsee Marty: Vierteljahrschrift f. wiss. Philos., x, 346.\n[109] By Exner, for example, Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vii, 628 ff.\n[110] P. 222. Cf. also Richet, Rev. Philos., vi, 395-6.\n[111] For instance, if, on the previous day, one had resolved to act on\na signal when it should come, and it now came whilst we were engaged in\nother things, and reminded us of the resolve.\n[112] \"I need hardly mention that success in these experiments depends\nin a high degree on our concentration of attention. If inattentive, one\ngets very discrepant figures.... This concentration of the attention\nis in the highest degree exhausting. After some experiments in which I\nwas concerned to get results as uniform as possible, I was covered with\nperspiration and excessively fatigued although I had sat quietly in my\nchair all the while.\" (Exner, _loc. cit._ vii, 618.)\n[113] Wundt, Physiol. Psych., ii, 226\n[114] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vii, 616.\n[115] In short, what M. Delb\u0153uf calls an '_organe adventice_.' The\nreaction-time, moreover, is quite compatible with the reaction itself\nbeing of a reflex order. Some reflexes (sneezing, e.g.) are very slow.\nThe only time-measurement of a reflex act in the human subject with\nwhich I am acquainted is Exner's measurement of winking (in Pfl\u00fcger's\nArchiv f. d. gesammt. Physiol., Bd. viii, p. 526, 1874). He found that\nwhen the stimulus was a flash of light it took the wink 0.2168 sec.\nto occur. A strong electric shock to the cornea shortened the time\nto 0.0578 sec. The ordinary 'reaction-time' is midway between these\nvalues. Exner 'reduces' his times by eliminating the physiological\nprocess of conduction. His 'reduced minimum winking-time' is then\n0.0471 (_ibid._ 531), whilst his reduced reaction-time is 0.0828\n(_ibid._ vii, 637). These figures have really no scientific value\nbeyond that of showing, according to Exner's own belief (vii, 531),\nthat reaction-time and reflex-time measure processes of essentially\nthe same order. His description, moreover, of the process is an\nexcellent description of a reflex act. \"Every one,\" says he, \"who\nmakes reaction-time experiments for the first time is surprised to\nfind how little he is master of his own movements, so soon as it\nbecomes a question of executing them with a maximum of speed. Not only\ndoes their energy lie, as it were, outside the field of choice, but\neven the time in which the movement occurs depends only partly upon\nourselves. We jerk our arm, and we can afterwards tell with astonishing\nprecision whether we have jerked it quicker or slower than another\ntime, although we have no power to jerk it exactly at the wished-for\nmoment.\"--Wundt himself admits that when we await a strong signal\nwith tense preparation there is no consciousness of any duality of\n'apperception' and motor response; the two are continuous (Physiol.\nPsych., ii, 226).--Mr. Cattell's view is identical with the one I\ndefend. \"I think,\" he says, \"that if the processes of perception and\nwilling are present at all they are very rudimentary.... The subject,\nby a voluntary effort [before the signal comes], puts the lines of\ncommunication between the centre for\" the stimulus \"and the centre for\nthe co-ordination of motions ... in a state of unstable equilibrium.\nWhen, therefore, a nervous impulse reaches the\" former centre, \"it\ncauses brain-changes in two directions; an impulse moves along to\nthe cortex and calls forth there a perception corresponding to the\nstimulus, while at the same time an impulse follows a line of small\nresistance to the centre for the co-ordination of motions, and the\nproper nervous impulse, already prepared and waiting for the signal,\nis sent from the centre to the muscle of the hand. When the reaction\nhas often been made the entire cerebral process becomes automatic, the\nimpulse of itself takes the well-travelled way to the motor centre, and\nreleases the motor impulse.\" (Mind, xi, 232-3.)--Finally, Prof. Lipps\nhas, in his elaborate way (Grundtatsachen, 179-188), made mince-meat of\nthe view that stage 3 involves either conscious perception or conscious\nwill.\n[116] Physiol.

Buccola's 'Legge del Tempo,' etc. See also\nchapter xvi of Wundt's Physiol. Psychology; Exner in Hermann's Hdbch.,\nBd. 2, Thl. ii, pp. 252-280; also Ribot's Contemp. Germ. Psych. chap.\nviii.\n[123] The nature of the movement also seems to make it vary. Mr. B. I.\nGilman and I reacted to the same signal by simply raising our hand, and\nagain by carrying our hand towards our back. The moment registered was\nalways that at which the hand broke an electric contact in _starting_\nto move. But it started one or two hundredths of a second later when\nthe more extensive movement was the one to be made. Orchansky, on the\nother hand, experimenting on contractions of the masseter muscle,\nfound (Archiv f. (Anat. u.) Physiol., 1889, p. 187) that the greater\nthe amplitude of contraction intended, the shorter grew the time of\nreaction. He explains this by the fact that a more ample contraction\nmakes a greater _appeal to the attention_, and that this shortens the\ntimes.\n[124] Physiol.

The habits to\nwhich there is an innate tendency are called instincts; some of those\ndue to education would by most persons be called acts of reason. It\nthus appears that habit covers a very large part of life, and that one\nengaged in studying the objective manifestations of mind is bound at\nthe very outset to define clearly just what its limits are.\nThe moment one tries to define what habit is, one is led to the\nfundamental properties of matter. The laws of Nature are nothing but\nthe immutable habits which the different elementary sorts of matter\nfollow in their actions and reactions upon each other. In the organic\nworld, however, the habits are more variable than this. Even instincts\nvary from one individual to another of a kind; and are modified in the\nsame individual, as we shall later see, to suit the exigencies of the\ncase. The habits of an elementary particle of matter cannot change (on\nthe principles of the atomistic philosophy), because the particle is\nitself an unchangeable thing; but those of a compound mass of matter\ncan change, because they are in the last instance due to the structure\nof the compound, and either outward forces or inward tensions can, from\none hour to another, turn that structure into something different from\nwhat it was. That is, they can do so if the body be plastic enough to\nmaintain its integrity, and be not disrupted when its structure yields.\nThe change of structure here spoken of need not involve the outward\nshape; it may be invisible and molecular, as when a bar of iron\nbecomes magnetic or crystalline through the action of certain outward\ncauses, or India-rubber becomes friable, or plaster 'sets.' All these\nchanges are rather slow; the material in question opposes a certain\nresistance to the modifying cause, which it takes time to overcome,\nbut the gradual yielding whereof often saves the material from being\ndisintegrated altogether. When the structure has yielded, the same\ninertia becomes a condition of its comparative permanence in the new\nform, and of the new habits the body then manifests. _Plasticity_,\nthen, in the wide sense of the word, means the possession of a\nstructure weak enough to yield to an influence, but strong enough not\nto yield all at once. Each relatively stable phase of equilibrium in\nsuch a structure is marked by what we may call a new set of habits.\nOrganic matter, especially nervous tissue, seems endowed with a very\nextraordinary degree of plasticity of this sort; so that we may without\nhesitation lay down as our first proposition the following, that _the\nphenomena of habit in living beings are due to the plasticity[137] of\nthe organic materials of which their bodies are composed_.\nBut the philosophy of habit is thus, in the first instance, a chapter\nin physics rather than in physiology or psychology. That it is at\nbottom a physical principle is admitted by all good recent writers\non the subject. They call attention to analogues of acquired habits\nexhibited by dead matter. Thus, M. L\u00e9on Dumont, whose essay on habit is\nperhaps the most philosophical account yet published, writes:\n\"Every one knows how a garment, after having been worn a certain\ntime, clings to the shape of the body better than when it was new;\nthere has been a change in the tissue, and this change is a new habit\nof cohesion. A lock works better after being used some time; at the\noutset more force was required to overcome certain roughnesses in\nthe mechanism. The overcoming of their resistance is a phenomenon of\nhabituation. It costs less trouble to fold a paper when it has been\nfolded already. This saving of trouble is due to the essential nature\nof habit, which brings it about that, to reproduce the effect, a\nless amount of the outward cause is required. The sounds of a violin\nimprove by use in the hands of an able artist, because the fibres of\nthe wood at last contract habits of vibration conformed to harmonic\nrelations. This is what gives such inestimable value to instruments\nthat have belonged to great masters. Water, in flowing, hollows out\nfor itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after\nhaving ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path\ntraced by itself before. Just so, the impressions of outer objects\nfashion for themselves in the nervous system more and more appropriate\npaths, and these vital phenomena recur under similar excitements from\nwithout, when they have been interrupted a certain time.\"[138]\nNot in the nervous system alone. A scar anywhere is a _locus minoris\nresistenti\u00e6_, more liable to be abraded, inflamed, to suffer pain and\ncold, than are the neighboring parts. A sprained ankle, a dislocated\narm, are in danger of being sprained or dislocated again; joints\nthat have once been attacked by rheumatism or gout, mucous membranes\nthat have been the seat of catarrh, are with each fresh recurrence\nmore prone to a relapse, until often the morbid state chronically\nsubstitutes itself for the sound one. And if we ascend to the nervous\nsystem, we find how many so-called functional diseases seem to keep\nthemselves going simply because they happen to have once begun; and\nhow the forcible cutting short by medicine of a few attacks is often\nsufficient to enable the physiological forces to get possession of\nthe field again, and to bring the organs back to functions of health.\nEpilepsies, neuralgias, convulsive affections of various sorts,\ninsomnias, are so many cases in point. And, to take what are more\nobviously habits, the success with which a 'weaning' treatment can\noften be applied to the victims of unhealthy indulgence of passion, or\nof mere complaining or irascible disposition, shows us how much the\nmorbid manifestations themselves were due to the mere inertia of the\nnervous organs, when once launched on a false career.\n*       *       *       *       *\nCan we now form a notion of what the inward physical changes may be\nlike, in organs whose habits have thus struck into new paths? In\nother words, can we say just what mechanical facts the expression\n'change of habit' covers when it is applied to a nervous system?\nCertainly we cannot in anything like a minute or definite way. But our\nusual scientific custom of interpreting hidden molecular events after\nthe analogy of visible massive ones enables us to frame easily an\nabstract and general scheme of processes which the physical changes in\nquestion _may_ be like. And when once the possibility of _some_ kind of\nmechanical interpretation is established, Mechanical Science, in her\npresent mood, will not hesitate to set her brand of ownership upon the\nmatter, feeling sure that it is only a question of time when the exact\nmechanical explanation of the case shall be found out.\nIf habits are due to the plasticity of materials to outward agents,\nwe can immediately see to what outward influences, if to any, the\nbrain-matter is plastic. Not to mechanical pressures, not to thermal\nchanges, not to any of the forces to which all the other organs of\nour body are exposed; for nature has carefully shut up our brain and\nspinal cord in bony boxes, where no influences of this sort can get at\nthem. She has floated them in fluid so that only the severest shocks\ncan give them a concussion, and blanketed and wrapped them about\nin an altogether exceptional way. The only impressions that can be\nmade upon them are through the blood, on the one hand, and through\nthe sensory nerve-roots, on the other; and it is to the infinitely\nattenuated currents that pour in through these latter channels that\nthe hemispherical cortex shows itself to be so peculiarly susceptible.\nThe currents, once in, must find a way out. In getting out they leave\ntheir traces in the paths which they take. The only thing they _can_\ndo, in short, is to deepen old paths or to make new ones; and the whole\nplasticity of the brain sums itself up in two words when we call it\nan organ in which currents pouring in from the sense-organs make with\nextreme facility paths which do not easily disappear. For, of course, a\nsimple habit, like every other nervous event--the habit of snuffling,\nfor example, or of putting one's hands into one's pockets, or of biting\none's nails--is, mechanically, nothing but a reflex discharge; and its\nanatomical substratum must be a path in the system. The most complex\nhabits, as we shall presently see more fully, are, from the same point\nof view, nothing but _concatenated_ discharges in the nerve-centres,\ndue to the presence there of systems of reflex paths, so organized as\nto wake each other up successively--the impression produced by one\nmuscular contraction serving as a stimulus to provoke the next, until\na final impression inhibits the process and closes the chain. The only\ndifficult mechanical problem is to explain the formation _de novo_ of\na simple reflex or path in a pre-existing nervous system. Here, as in\nso many other cases, it is only the _premier pas qui co\u00fbte_. For the\nentire nervous system _is_ nothing but a system of paths between a\nsensory _terminus a quo_ and a muscular, glandular, or other _terminus\nad quem_. A path once traversed by a nerve-current might be expected\nto follow the law of most of the paths we know, and to be scooped out\nand made more permeable than before;[139] and this ought to be repeated\nwith each new passage of the current. Whatever obstructions may have\nkept it at first from being a path should then, little by little, and\nmore and more, be swept out of the way, until at last it might become\na natural drainage-channel. This is what happens where either solids\nor liquids pass over a path; there seems no reason why it should not\nhappen where the thing that passes is a mere wave of rearrangement in\nmatter that does not displace itself, but merely changes chemically\nor turns itself round in place, or vibrates across the line. The most\nplausible views of the nerve-current make it out to be the passage\nof some such wave of rearrangement as this. If only a part of the\nmatter of the path were to 'rearrange' itself, the neighboring parts\nremaining inert, it is easy to see how their inertness might oppose\na friction which it would take many waves of rearrangement to break\ndown and overcome. If we call the path itself the 'organ,' and the\nwave of rearrangement the 'function,' then it is obviously a case\nfor repeating the celebrated French formula of '_La fonction fait\nl'organe._'\nSo nothing is easier than to imagine how, when a current once has\ntraversed a path, it should traverse it more readily still a second\ntime. But what made it ever traverse it the first time?[140] In\nanswering this question we can only fall back on our general conception\nof a nervous system as a mass of matter whose parts, constantly kept\nin states of different tension, are as constantly tending to equalize\ntheir states. The equalization between any two points occurs through\nwhatever path may at the moment be most pervious. But, as a given point\nof the system may belong, actually or potentially, to many different\npaths, and, as the play of nutrition is subject to accidental changes,\n_blocks_ may from time to time occur, and make currents shoot through\nunwonted lines. Such an unwonted line would be a new-created path,\nwhich if traversed repeatedly, would become the beginning of a new\nreflex arc. All this is vague to the last degree, and amounts to little\nmore than saying that a new path may be formed by the sort of _chances_\nthat in nervous material are likely to occur. But, vague as it is, it\nis really the last word of our wisdom in the matter.[141]\nIt must be noticed that the growth of structural modification in\nliving matter may be more rapid than in any lifeless mass, because the\nincessant nutritive renovation of which the living matter is the seat\ntends often to corroborate and fix the impressed modification, rather\nthan to counteract it by renewing the original constitution of the\ntissue that has been impressed. Thus, we notice after exercising our\nmuscles or our brain in a new way, that we can do so no longer at that\ntime; but after a day or two of rest, when we resume the discipline,\nour increase in skill not seldom surprises us. I have often noticed\nthis in learning a tune; and it has led a German author to say that we\nlearn to swim during the winter and to skate during the summer.\nDr. Carpenter writes:[142]\n\"It is a matter of universal experience that every kind of training\nfor special aptitudes is both far more effective, and leaves a more\npermanent impress, when exerted on the _growing_ organism than when\nbrought to bear on the adult. The effect of such training is shown\nin the tendency of the organ to 'grow to' the mode in which it is\nhabitually exercised; as is evidenced by the increased size and power\nof particular sets of muscles, and the extraordinary flexibility\nof joints, which are acquired by such as have been early exercised\nin gymnastic performances.... There is no part of the organism of\nman in which the _reconstructive activity_ is so great, during the\nwhole period of life, as it is in the ganglionic substance of the\nbrain. This is indicated by the enormous supply of blood which it\nreceives.... It is, moreover, a fact of great significance that\nthe nerve-substance is specially distinguished by its _reparative_\npower. For while injuries of other tissues (such as the muscular)\nwhich are distinguished by the _speciality_ of their structure and\nendowments, are repaired by substance of a lower or less specialized\ntype, those of nerve-substance are repaired by a complete reproduction\nof the normal tissue; as is evidenced in the sensibility of the\nnewly forming skin which is closing over an open wound, or in the\nrecovery of the sensibility of a piece of 'transplanted' skin, which\nhas for a time been rendered insensible by the complete interruption\nof the continuity of its nerves. The most remarkable example of\nthis reproduction, however, is afforded by the results of M.\nBrown-S\u00e9quard's[143] experiments upon the gradual restoration of the\nfunctional activity of the spinal cord after its complete division;\nwhich takes place in a way that indicates rather a _reproduction_ of\nthe whole, or the lower part of the cord and of the nerves proceeding\nfrom it, than a mere _reunion_ of divided surfaces. This reproduction\nis but a special manifestation of the reconstructive change which is\n_always_ taking place in the nervous system; it being not less obvious\nto the eye of reason that the 'waste' occasioned by its functional\nactivity must be constantly repaired by the production of new tissue,\nthan it is to the eye of sense that such reparation supplies an actual\n_loss_ of substance by disease or injury.\n\"Now, in this constant and active reconstruction of the nervous\nsystem, we recognize a most marked conformity to the general plan\nmanifested in the nutrition of the organism as a whole. For, in\nthe first place, it is obvious that there is a tendency to the\nproduction of a _determinate type_ of structure; which type is often\nnot merely that of the species, but some special modification of it\nwhich characterized one or both of the progenitors. But this type is\npeculiarly liable to modification during the early period of life; in\nwhich the functional activity of the nervous system (and particularly\nof the brain) is extraordinarily great, and the reconstructive process\nproportionally active. And this modifiability expresses itself in the\nformation of the mechanism by which those _secondarily automatic_\nmodes of movement come to be established, which, in man, take the\nplace of those that are _congenital_ in most of the animals beneath\nhim; and those modes of sense-perception come to be _acquired_, which\nare elsewhere clearly _instinctive_. For there can be no reasonable\ndoubt that, in both cases, a nervous mechanism is _developed_ in the\ncourse of this self-education, corresponding with that which the lower\nanimals inherit from their parents. The _plan_ of that _rebuilding_\nprocess, which is necessary to maintain the integrity of the organism\ngenerally, and which goes on with peculiar activity in this portion of\nit, is thus being incessantly modified; and in this manner all that\nportion of it which ministers to the _external_ life of sense and\nmotion that is shared by man with the animal kingdom at large, becomes\nat adult age the expression of the habits which the individual has\nacquired during the period of growth and development. Of these habits,\nsome are common to the race generally, while others are peculiar to\nthe individual; those of the former kind (such as walking erect) being\nuniversally acquired, save where physical inability prevents; while\nfor the latter a special training is needed, which is usually the more\neffective the earlier it is begun--as is remarkably seen in the case\nof such feats of dexterity as require a conjoint education of the\nperceptive and of the motor powers. And when thus developed during\nthe period of growth, so as to have become a part of the constitution\nof the adult, the acquired mechanism is thenceforth maintained in the\nordinary course of the nutritive operations, so as to be ready for use\nwhen called upon, even after long inaction.\n\"What is so clearly true of the nervous apparatus of animal life\ncan scarcely be otherwise than true of that which ministers to the\nautomatic activity of the mind. For, as already shown, the study\nof psychology has evolved no more certain result than that there\nare uniformities of mental action which are so entirely conformable\nto those of bodily action as to indicate their intimate relation\nto a 'mechanism of thought and feeling,' acting under the like\nconditions with that of sense and motion. The psychical principles\nof _association_, indeed, and the physiological principles of\n_nutrition_, simply express--the former in terms of mind, the latter\nin terms of brain--the universally admitted fact that any sequence of\nmental action which has been frequently repeated tends to perpetuate\nitself; so that we find ourselves automatically prompted to _think,\nfeel,_ or _do_ what we have been before accustomed to think, feel,\nor do, under like circumstances, without any consciously formed\n_purpose_, or anticipation of results. For there is no reason to\nregard the cerebrum as an exception to the general principle that,\nwhile each part of the organism tends to _form itself_ in accordance\nwith the mode in which it is habitually exercised, this tendency\nwill be especially strong in the nervous apparatus, in virtue of\nthat _incessant regeneration_ which is the very condition of its\nfunctional activity. It scarcely, indeed, admits of doubt that every\nstate of ideational consciousness which is either _very strong_ or is\n_habitually repeated_ leaves an organic impression on the cerebrum; in\nvirtue of which that same state may be reproduced at any future time,\nin respondence to a suggestion fitted to excite it.... The 'strength\nof early association' is a fact so universally recognized that the\nexpression of it has become proverbial; and this precisely accords\nwith the physiological principle that, during the period of growth\nand development, the formative activity of the brain will be most\namenable to directing influences. It is in this way that what is early\n'learned by heart' becomes branded in (as it were) upon the cerebrum;\nso that its 'traces' are never lost, even though the conscious\nmemory of it may have completely faded out. For, when the organic\nmodification has been once _fixed_ in the growing brain, it becomes a\npart of the normal fabric, and is regularly _maintained_ by nutritive\nsubstitution; so that it may endure to the end of life, like the scar\nof a wound.\"\nDr. Carpenter's phrase that _our nervous system grows to the modes in\nwhich it has been exercised_ expresses the philosophy of habit in a\nnutshell. We may now trace some of the practical applications of the\nprinciple to human life.\nThe first result of it is that _habit simplifies the movements required\nto achieve a given result, makes them more accurate and diminishes\nfatigue_.\n\"The beginner at the piano not only moves his finger up and down in\norder to depress the key, he moves the whole hand, the forearm and\neven the entire body, especially moving its least rigid part, the\nhead, as if he would press down the key with that organ too. Often\na contraction of the abdominal muscles occurs as well. Principally,\nhowever, the impulse is determined to the motion of the hand and of\nthe single finger. This is, in the first place, because the movement\nof the finger is the movement _thought of_ and, in the second place,\nbecause its movement and that of the key are the movements we try to\n_perceive_, along with the results of the latter on the ear. The more\noften the process is repeated, the more easily the movement follows,\non account of the increase in permeability of the nerves engaged.\n\"But the more easily the movement occurs, the slighter is the stimulus\nrequired to set it up; and the slighter the stimulus is, the more its\neffect is confined to the fingers alone.\n\"Thus, an impulse which originally spread its effects over the whole\nbody, or at least over many of its movable parts, is gradually\ndetermined to a single definite organ, in which it effects the\ncontraction of a few limited muscles. In this change the thoughts and\nperceptions which start the impulse acquire more and more intimate\ncausal relations with a particular group of motor nerves.\n\"To recur to a simile, at least partially apt, imagine the nervous\nsystem to represent a drainage-system, inclining, on the whole, toward\ncertain muscles, but with the escape thither somewhat clogged. Then\nstreams of water will, on the whole, tend most to fill the drains\nthat go towards these muscles and to wash out the escape. In case of\na sudden 'flushing,' however, the whole system of channels will fill\nitself, and the water overflow everywhere before it escapes. But a\nmoderate quantity of water invading the system will flow through the\nproper escape alone.\n\"Just so with the piano-player. As soon as his impulse, which has\ngradually learned to confine itself to single muscles, grows extreme,\nit overflows into larger muscular regions. He usually plays with his\nfingers, his body being at rest. But no sooner does he get excited\nthan his whole body becomes 'animated,' and he moves his head and\ntrunk, in particular, as if these also were organs with which he meant\nto belabor the keys.\"[144]\nMan is born with a tendency to do more things than he has ready-made\narrangements for in his nerve-centres. Most of the performances of\nother animals are automatic. But in him the number of them is so\nenormous, that most of them must be the fruit of painful study. If\npractice did not make perfect, nor habit economize the expense of\nnervous and muscular energy, he would therefore be in a sorry plight.\nAs Dr. Maudsley says:[145]\n\"If an act became no easier after being done several times, if\nthe careful direction of consciousness were necessary to its\naccomplishment on each occasion, it is evident that the whole activity\nof a lifetime might be confined to one or two deeds--that no progress\ncould take place in development. A man might be occupied all day in\ndressing and undressing himself; the attitude of his body would\nabsorb all his attention and energy; the washing of his hands or the\nfastening of a button would be as difficult to him on each occasion\nas to the child on its first trial; and he would, furthermore, be\ncompletely exhausted by his exertions. Think of the pains necessary to\nteach a child to stand, of the many efforts which it must make, and of\nthe ease with which it at last stands, unconscious of any effort. For\nwhile secondarily automatic acts are accomplished with comparatively\nlittle weariness--in this regard approaching the organic movements, or\nthe original reflex movements--the conscious effort of the will soon\nproduces exhaustion. A spinal cord without ... memory would simply\nbe an idiotic spinal cord.... It is impossible for an individual to\nrealize how much he owes to its automatic agency until disease has\nimpaired its functions.\"\nThe next result is that _habit diminishes the conscious attention with\nwhich our acts are performed_.\nOne may state this abstractly thus: If an act require for its execution\na chain, _A, B, C, D, E, F, G,_ etc., of successive nervous events,\nthen in the first performances of the action the conscious will must\nchoose each of these events from a number of wrong alternatives that\ntend to present themselves; but habit soon brings it about that each\nevent calls up its own appropriate successor without any alternative\noffering itself, and without any reference to the conscious will,\nuntil at last the whole chain, _A, B, C, D, E, F, G,_ rattles itself\noff as soon as _A_ occurs, just as if _A_ and the rest of the chain\nwere fused into a continuous stream. When we are learning to walk,\nto ride, to swim, skate, fence, write, play, or sing, we interrupt\nourselves at every step by unnecessary movements and false notes. When\nwe are proficients, on the contrary, the results not only follow with\nthe very minimum of muscular action requisite to bring them forth,\nthey also follow from a single instantaneous 'cue.' The marksman sees\nthe bird, and, before he knows it, he has aimed and shot. A gleam in\nhis adversary's eye, a momentary pressure from his rapier, and the\nfencer finds that he has instantly made the right parry and return. A\nglance at the musical hieroglyphics, and the pianist's fingers have\nrippled through a cataract of notes. And not only is it the right\nthing at the right time that we thus involuntarily do, but the wrong\nthing also, if it be an habitual thing. Who is there that has never\nwound up his watch on taking off his waistcoat in the daytime, or\ntaken his latch-key out on arriving at the door-step of a friend? Very\nabsent-minded persons in going to their bedroom to dress for dinner\nhave been known to take off one garment after another and finally to\nget into bed, merely because that was the habitual issue of the first\nfew movements when performed at a later hour. The writer well remembers\nhow, on revisiting Paris after ten years' absence, and, finding himself\nin the street in which for one winter he had attended school, he lost\nhimself in a brown study, from which he was awakened by finding himself\nupon the stairs which led to the apartment in a house many streets\naway in which he had lived during that earlier time, and to which his\nsteps from the school had then habitually led. We all of us have a\ndefinite routine manner of performing certain daily offices connected\nwith the toilet, with the opening and shutting of familiar cupboards,\nand the like. Our lower centres know the order of these movements, and\nshow their knowledge by their 'surprise' if the objects are altered\nso as to oblige the movement to be made in a different way. But our\nhigher thought-centres know hardly anything about the matter. Few men\ncan tell off-hand which sock, shoe, or trousers-leg they put on first.\nThey must first mentally rehearse the act; and even that is often\ninsufficient--the act must be _performed_. So of the questions, Which\nvalve of my double door opens first? Which way does my door swing? etc.\nI cannot _tell_ the answer; yet my _hand_ never makes a mistake. No one\ncan _describe_ the order in which he brushes his hair or teeth; yet it\nis likely that the order is a pretty fixed one in all of us.\nThese results may be expressed as follows:\nIn action grown habitual, what instigates each new muscular\ncontraction to take place in its appointed order is not a thought or a\nperception, but the _sensation occasioned by the muscular contraction\njust finished_. A strictly voluntary act has to be guided by idea,\nperception, and volition, throughout its whole course. In an habitual\naction, mere sensation is a sufficient guide, and the upper regions\nof brain and mind are set comparatively free. A diagram will make the\nmatter clear:\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\nLet _A, B, C, D, E, F, G_ represent an habitual chain of muscular\ncontractions, and let _a, b, c, d, e, f_ stand for the respective\nsensations which these contractions excite in us when they are\nsuccessively performed. Such sensations will usually be of the muscles,\nskin, or joints of the parts moved, but they may also be effects of the\nmovement upon the eye or the ear. Through them, and through them alone,\nwe are made aware whether the contraction has or has not occurred. When\nthe series, _A, B, C, D, E, F, G,_ is being learned, each of these\nsensations becomes the object of a separate perception by the mind.\nBy it we test each movement, to see if it be right before advancing\nto the next. We hesitate, compare, choose, revoke, reject, etc.,\nby intellectual means; and the order by which the next movement is\ndischarged is an express order from the ideational centres after this\ndeliberation has been gone through.\nIn habitual action, on the contrary, the only impulse which the\ncentres of idea or perception need send down is the initial impulse,\nthe command to _start_. This is represented in the diagram by _V_; it\nmay be a thought of the first movement or of the last result, or a\nmere perception of some of the habitual conditions of the chain, the\npresence, e.g., of the keyboard near the hand. In the present case, no\nsooner has the conscious thought or volition instigated movement _A_,\nthan _A_, through the sensation _a_ of its own occurrence, awakens\n_B_ reflexly; _B_ then excites _C_ through _b_, and so on till the\nchain is ended, when the intellect generally takes cognizance of the\nfinal result. The process, in fact, resembles the passage of a wave\nof 'peristaltic' motion down the bowels. The intellectual perception\nat the end is indicated in the diagram by the effect of _G_ being\nrepresented, at _G'_, in the ideational centres above the merely\nsensational line. The sensational impressions, _a, b, c, d, e, f,_\nare all supposed to have their seat below the ideational lines. That\nour ideational centres, if involved at all by _a, b, c, d, e, f,_ are\ninvolved in a minimal degree, is shown by the fact that the attention\nmay be wholly absorbed elsewhere. We may say our prayers, or repeat the\nalphabet, with our attention far away.\n\"A musical performer will play a piece which has become familiar\nby repetition while carrying on an animated conversation, or while\ncontinuously engrossed by some train of deeply interesting thought;\nthe accustomed sequence of movements being directly prompted by\nthe _sight_ of the notes, or by the remembered succession of the\n_sounds_ (if the piece is played from memory), aided in both cases\nby the guiding sensations derived from the muscles themselves. But,\nfurther, a higher degree of the same 'training' (acting on an organism\nspecially fitted to profit by it) enables an accomplished pianist to\nplay a difficult piece of music at sight; the movements of the hands\nand fingers following so immediately upon the sight of the notes that\nit seems impossible to believe that any but the very shortest and most\ndirect track can be the channel of the nervous communication through\nwhich they are called forth. The following curious example of the same\nclass of _acquired aptitudes_, which differ from instincts only in\nbeing prompted to action by the will, is furnished by Robert Houdin:\n\"'With a view of cultivating the rapidity of visual and tactile\nperception, and the precision of respondent movements, which are\nnecessary for success in every kind of prestidigitation, Houdin early\npractised the art of juggling with balls in the air; and having, after\na month's practice, become thorough master of the art of keeping up\n_four_ balls at once, he placed a book before him, and, while the\nballs were in the air, accustomed himself to read without hesitation.\n'This,' he says, 'will probably seem to my readers very extraordinary;\nbut I shall surprise them still more when I say that I have just\namused myself with repeating this curious experiment. Though thirty\nyears have elapsed since the time I was writing, and though I have\nscarcely once touched the balls during that period, I can still manage\nto read with ease while keeping _three_ balls up.'\"(Autobiography, p.\n26.)[146]\nWe have called _a, b, c, d, e, f,_ the antecedents of the successive\nmuscular attractions, by the name of sensations. Some authors seem\nto deny that they are even this. If not even this, they can only be\ncentripetal nerve-currents, not sufficient to arouse feeling, but\nsufficient to arouse motor response.[147] It may be at once admitted\nthat they are not distinct _volitions_. The will, if any will be\npresent, limits itself to a _permission_ that they exert their motor\neffects. Dr. Carpenter writes:\n\"There may still be metaphysicians who maintain that actions which\nwere originally prompted by the will with a distinct intention, and\nwhich are still entirely under its control, can never cease to be\nvolitional; and that either an infinitesimally small amount of will\nis required to sustain them when they have been once set going, or\nthat the will is in a sort of pendulum-like oscillation between the\ntwo actions--the maintenance of the train of _thought_, and the\nmaintenance of the train of _movement_. But if only an infinitesimally\nsmall amount of will is necessary to sustain them, is not this\ntantamount to saying that they go on by a force of their own? And\ndoes not the experience of the _perfect continuity_ of our train of\nthought during the performance of movements that have become habitual,\nentirely negative the hypothesis of oscillation? Besides, if such an\noscillation existed, there must be _intervals_ in which each action\ngoes on _of itself_; so that its essentially automatic character is\nvirtually admitted. The physiological explanation, that the mechanism\nof locomotion, as of other habitual movements, _grows to_ the mode\nin which it is early exercised, and that it then works automatically\nunder the general control and direction of the will, can scarcely\nbe put down by any assumption of an hypothetical necessity, which\nrests only on the basis of ignorance of one side of our composite\nnature.\"[148]\nBut if not distinct acts of will, these immediate antecedents of each\nmovement of the chain are at any rate accompanied by consciousness of\nsome kind. They are _sensations_ to which we are _usually inattentive_,\nbut which immediately call our attention if they go _wrong_.\nSchneider's account of these sensations deserves to be quoted. In the\nact of walking, he says, even when our attention is entirely off,\n\"we are continuously aware of certain muscular feelings; and we have,\nmoreover, a feeling of certain impulses to keep our equilibrium and\nto set down one leg after another. It is doubtful whether we could\npreserve equilibrium if no sensation of our body's attitude were\nthere, and doubtful whether we should advance our leg if we had no\nsensation of its movement as executed, and not even a minimal feeling\nof impulse to set it down. Knitting appears altogether mechanical,\nand the knitter keeps up her knitting even while she reads or is\nengaged in lively talk. But if we ask her how this be possible, she\nwill hardly reply that the knitting goes on of itself. She will rather\nsay that she has a feeling of it, that she feels in her hands that\nshe knits and how she must knit, and that therefore the movements of\nknitting are called forth and regulated by the sensations associated\ntherewithal, even when the attention is called away.\n\"So of every one who practises, apparently automatically, a\nlong-familiar handicraft. The smith turning his tongs as he smites\nthe iron, the carpenter wielding his plane, the lace-maker with her\nbobbin, the weaver at his loom, all will answer the same question\nin the same way by saying that they have a feeling of the proper\nmanagement of the implement in their hands.\n\"In these cases, the feelings which are conditions of the appropriate\nacts are very faint. But none the less are they necessary. Imagine\nyour hands not feeling; your movements could then only be provoked\nby ideas, and if your ideas were then diverted away, the movements\nought to come to a standstill, which is a consequence that seldom\noccurs.\"[149]\nAgain:\n\"An idea makes you take, for example, a violin into your left hand.\nBut it is not necessary that your idea remain fixed on the contraction\nof the muscles of the left hand and fingers in order that the violin\nmay continue to be held fast and not let fall. The sensations\nthemselves which the holding of the instrument awakens in the hand,\nsince they are associated with the motor impulse of grasping, are\nsufficient to cause this impulse, which then lasts as long as the\nfeeling itself lasts, or until the impulse is inhibited by the idea of\nsome antagonistic motion.\"\nAnd the same may be said of the manner in which the right hand holds\nthe bow:\n\"It sometimes happens, in beginning these simultaneous combinations,\nthat one movement or impulse will cease if the consciousness turn\nparticularly toward another, because at the outset the guiding\nsensations must _all_ be strongly _felt_. The bow will perhaps slip\nfrom the fingers, because some of the muscles have relaxed. But the\nslipping is a cause of new sensations starting up in the hand, so that\nthe attention is in a moment brought back to the grasping of the bow.\n\"The following experiment shows this well: When one begins to play\non the violin, to keep him from raising his right elbow in playing\na book is placed under his right armpit, which he is ordered to hold\nfast by keeping the upper arm tight against his body. The muscular\nfeelings, and feelings of contact connected with the book, provoke an\nimpulse to press it tight. But often it happens that the beginner,\nwhose attention gets absorbed in the production of the notes, lets\ndrop the book. Later, however, this never happens; the faintest\nsensations of contact suffice to awaken the impulse to keep it in\nits place, and the attention may be wholly absorbed by the notes and\nthe fingering with the left hand. _The simultaneous combination of\nmovements is thus in the first instance conditioned by the facility\nwith which in us, alongside of intellectual processes, processes of\ninattentive feeling may still go on._\"[150]\nThis brings us by a very natural transition to the _ethical\nimplications of the law of habit_. They are numerous and momentous.\nDr. Carpenter, from whose 'Mental Physiology' we have quoted, has so\nprominently enforced the principle that our organs grow to the way in\nwhich they have been exercised, and dwelt upon its consequences, that\nhis book almost deserves to be called a work of edification, on this\naccount alone. We need make no apology, then, for tracing a few of\nthese consequences ourselves:\n\"Habit a second nature! Habit is ten times nature,\" the Duke of\nWellington is said to have exclaimed; and the degree to which this is\ntrue no one can probably appreciate as well as one who is a veteran\nsoldier himself. The daily drill and the years of discipline end by\nfashioning a man completely over again, as to most of the possibilities\nof his conduct.\n\"There is a story, which is credible enough, though it may not be\ntrue, of a practical joker, who, seeing a discharged veteran carrying\nhome his dinner, suddenly called out, 'Attention!' whereupon the man\ninstantly brought his hands down, and lost his mutton and potatoes in\nthe gutter. The drill had been thorough, and its effects had become\nembodied in the man's nervous structure.\"[151]\nRiderless cavalry-horses, at many a battle, have been seen to come\ntogether and go through their customary evolutions at the sound of\nthe bugle-call. Most trained domestic animals, dogs and oxen, and\nomnibus- and car-horses, seem to be machines almost pure and simple,\nundoubtingly, unhesitatingly doing from minute to minute the duties\nthey have been taught, and giving no sign that the possibility of an\nalternative ever suggests itself to their mind. Men grown old in prison\nhave asked to be readmitted after being once set free. In a railroad\naccident to a travelling menagerie in the United States some time in\n1881, a tiger, whose cage had broken open, is said to have emerged,\nbut presently crept back again, as if too much bewildered by his new\nresponsibilities, so that he was without difficulty secured.\nHabit is thus the enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious\nconservative agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of\nordinance, and saves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings\nof the poor. It alone prevents the hardest and most repulsive walks of\nlife from being deserted by those brought up to tread therein. It keeps\nthe fisherman and the deck-hand at sea through the winter; it holds the\nminer in his darkness, and nails the countryman to his log-cabin and\nhis lonely farm through all the months of snow; it protects us from\ninvasion by the natives of the desert and the frozen zone. It dooms us\nall to fight out the battle of life upon the lines of our nurture or\nour early choice, and to make the best of a pursuit that disagrees,\nbecause there is no other for which we are fitted, and it is too late\nto begin again. It keeps different social strata from mixing. Already\nat the age of twenty-five you see the professional mannerism settling\ndown on the young commercial traveller, on the young doctor, on the\nyoung minister, on the young counsellor-at-law. You see the little\nlines of cleavage running through the character, the tricks of thought,\nthe prejudices, the ways of the 'shop,' in a word, from which the man\ncan by-and-by no more escape than his coat-sleeve can suddenly fall\ninto a new set of folds. On the whole, it is best he should not escape.\nIt is well for the world that in most of us, by the age of thirty, the\ncharacter has set like plaster, and will never soften again.\nIf the period between twenty and thirty is the critical one in the\nformation of intellectual and professional habits, the period below\ntwenty is more important still for the fixing of _personal_ habits,\nproperly so called, such as vocalization and pronunciation, gesture,\nmotion, and address. Hardly ever is a language learned after twenty\nspoken without a foreign accent; hardly ever can a youth transferred\nto the society of his betters unlearn the nasality and other vices of\nspeech bred in him by the associations of his growing years. Hardly\never, indeed, no matter how much money there be in his pocket, can\nhe even learn to _dress_ like a gentleman-born. The merchants offer\ntheir wares as eagerly to him as to the veriest 'swell,' but he\nsimply _cannot_ buy the right things. An invisible law, as strong as\ngravitation, keeps him within his orbit, arrayed this year as he was\nthe last; and how his better-bred acquaintances contrive to get the\nthings they wear will be for him a mystery till his dying day.\nThe great thing, then, in all education, is to _make our nervous\nsystem our ally instead of our enemy_. It is to fund and capitalize\nour acquisitions, and live at ease upon the interest of the fund.\n_For this we must make automatic and habitual, as early as possible,\nas many useful actions as we can,_ and guard against the growing into\nways that are likely to be disadvantageous to us, as we should guard\nagainst the plague. The more of the details of our daily life we can\nhand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher\npowers of mind will be set free for their own proper work. There is no\nmore miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but\nindecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking\nof every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the\nbeginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional\ndeliberation. Full half the time of such a man goes to the deciding,\nor regretting, of matters which ought to be so ingrained in him as\npractically not to exist for his consciousness at all. If there be such\ndaily duties not yet ingrained in any one of my readers, let him begin\nthis very hour to set the matter right.\nIn Professor Bain's chapter on 'The Moral Habits' there are some\nadmirable practical remarks laid down. Two great maxims emerge from his\ntreatment. The first is that in the acquisition of a new habit, or\nthe leaving off of an old one, we must take care to _launch ourselves\nwith as strong and decided an initiative as possible_. Accumulate all\nthe possible circumstances which shall re-enforce the right motives;\nput yourself assiduously in conditions that encourage the new way; make\nengagements incompatible with the old; take a public pledge, if the\ncase allows; in short, envelop your resolution with every aid you know.\nThis will give your new beginning such a momentum that the temptation\nto break down will not occur as soon as it otherwise might; and every\nday during which a breakdown is postponed adds to the chances of its\nnot occurring at all.\nThe second maxim is: _Never suffer an exception to occur till the new\nhabit is securely rooted in your life_. Each lapse is like the letting\nfall of a ball of string which one is carefully winding up; a single\nslip undoes more than a great many turns will wind again. _Continuity_\nof training is the great means of making the nervous system act\ninfallibly right. As Professor Bain says:\n\"The peculiarity of the moral habits, contradistinguishing them from\nthe intellectual acquisitions, is the presence of two hostile powers,\none to be gradually raised into the ascendant over the other. It\nis necessary, above all things, in such a situation, never to lose\na battle. Every gain on the wrong side undoes the effect of many\nconquests on the right. The essential precaution, therefore, is so\nto regulate the two opposing powers that the one may have a series\nof uninterrupted successes, until repetition has fortified it to\nsuch a degree as to enable it to cope with the opposition, under\nany circumstances. This is the theoretically best career of mental\nprogress.\"\nThe need of securing success at the _outset_ is imperative. Failure at\nfirst is apt to dampen the energy of all future attempts, whereas past\nexperience of success nerves one to future vigor. Goethe says to a man\nwho consulted him about an enterprise but mistrusted his own powers:\n\"Ach! you need only blow on your hands!\" And the remark illustrates the\neffect on Goethe's spirits of his own habitually successful career.\nProf. Baumann, from whom I borrow the anecdote,[152] says that the\ncollapse of barbarian nations when Europeans come among them is due\nto their despair of ever succeeding as the new-comers do in the larger\ntasks of life. Old ways are broken and new ones not formed.\nThe question of 'tapering-off,' in abandoning such habits as drink and\nopium-indulgence, comes in here, and is a question about which experts\ndiffer within certain limits, and in regard to what may be best for an\nindividual case. In the main, however, all expert opinion would agree\nthat abrupt acquisition of the new habit is the best way, _if there be\na real possibility of carrying it out_. We must be careful not to give\nthe will so stiff a task as to insure its defeat at the very outset;\nbut, _provided one can stand it_, a sharp period of suffering, and then\na free time, is the best thing to aim at, whether in giving up a habit\nlike that of opium, or in simply changing one's hours of rising or of\nwork. It is surprising how soon a desire will die of inanition if it be\n_never_ fed.\n\"One must first learn, unmoved, looking neither to the right nor\nleft, to walk firmly on the straight and narrow path, before one can\nbegin 'to make one's self over again.' He who every day makes a fresh\nresolve is like one who, arriving at the edge of the ditch he is to\nleap, forever stops and returns for a fresh run. Without _unbroken_\nadvance there is no such thing as _accumulation_ of the ethical forces\npossible, and to make this possible, and to exercise us and habituate\nus in it, is the sovereign blessing of regular _work_.\"[153]\nA third maxim may be added to the preceding pair: _Seize the very first\npossible opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every\nemotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits\nyou aspire to gain._ It is not in the moment of their forming, but\nin the moment of their producing _motor effects_, that resolves and\naspirations communicate the new 'set' to the brain. As the author last\nquoted remarks:\n\"The actual presence of the practical opportunity alone furnishes the\nfulcrum upon which the lever can rest, by means of which the moral\nwill may multiply its strength, and raise itself aloft. He who has no\nsolid ground to press against will never get beyond the stage of empty\ngesture-making.\"\nNo matter how full a reservoir of _maxims_ one may possess, and no\nmatter how good one's _sentiments_ may be, if one have not taken\nadvantage of every concrete opportunity to _act_, one's character may\nremain entirely unaffected for the better. With mere good intentions,\nhell is proverbially paved. And this is an obvious consequence of the\nprinciples we have laid down. A 'character,' as J. S. Mill says, 'is\na completely fashioned will'; and a will, in the sense in which he\nmeans it, is an aggregate of tendencies to act in a firm and prompt and\ndefinite way upon all the principal emergencies of life. A tendency\nto act only becomes effectively ingrained in us in proportion to the\nuninterrupted frequency with which the actions actually occur, and\nthe brain 'grows' to their use. Every time a resolve or a fine glow\nof feeling evaporates without bearing practical fruit is worse than a\nchance lost; it works so as positively to hinder future resolutions\nand emotions from taking the normal path of discharge. There is no\nmore contemptible type of human character than that of the nerveless\nsentimentalist and dreamer, who spends his life in a weltering sea of\nsensibility and emotion, but who never does a manly concrete deed.\nRousseau, inflaming all the mothers of France, by his eloquence, to\nfollow Nature and nurse their babies themselves, while he sends his\nown children to the foundling hospital, is the classical example of\nwhat I mean. But every one of us in his measure, whenever, after\nglowing for an abstractly formulated Good, he practically ignores\nsome actual case, among the squalid 'other particulars' of which that\nsame Good lurks disguised, treads straight on Rousseau's path. All\nGoods are disguised by the vulgarity of their concomitants, in this\nwork-a-day world; but woe to him who can only recognize them when he\nthinks them in their pure and abstract form! The habit of excessive\nnovel-reading and theatre-going will produce true monsters in this\nline. The weeping of a Russian lady over the fictitious personages in\nthe play, while her coachman is freezing to death on his seat outside,\nis the sort of thing that everywhere happens on a less glaring scale.\nEven the habit of excessive indulgence in music, for those who are\nneither performers themselves nor musically gifted enough to take\nit in a purely intellectual way, has probably a relaxing effect upon\nthe character. One becomes filled with emotions which habitually pass\nwithout prompting to any deed, and so the inertly sentimental condition\nis kept up. The remedy would be, never to suffer one's self to have an\nemotion at a concert, without expressing it afterward in _some_ active\nway.[154] Let the expression be the least thing in the world--speaking\ngenially to one's aunt, or giving up one's seat in a horse-car, if\nnothing more heroic offers--but let it not fail to take place.\nThese latter cases make us aware that it is not simply _particular\nlines_ of discharge, but also _general forms_ of discharge, that\nseem to be grooved out by habit in the brain. Just as, if we let our\nemotions evaporate, they get into a way of evaporating; so there is\nreason to suppose that if we often flinch from making an effort, before\nwe know it the effort-making capacity will be gone; and that, if we\nsuffer the wandering of our attention, presently it will wander all the\ntime. Attention and effort are, as we shall see later, but two names\nfor the same psychic fact. To what brain-processes they correspond we\ndo not know. The strongest reason for believing that they do depend on\nbrain-processes at all, and are not pure acts of the spirit, is just\nthis fact, that they seem in some degree subject to the law of habit,\nwhich is a material law. As a final practical maxim, relative to these\nhabits of the will, we may, then, offer something like this: _Keep\nthe faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise\nevery day_. That is, be systematically ascetic or heroic in little\nunnecessary points, do every day or two something for no other reason\nthan that you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire\nneed draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand\nthe test. Asceticism of this sort is like the insurance which a man\npays on his house and goods. The tax does him no good at the time, and\npossibly may never bring him a return. But if the fire _does_ come,\nhis having paid it will be his salvation from ruin. So with the man\nwho has daily inured himself to habits of concentrated attention,\nenergetic volition, and self-denial in unnecessary things. He will\nstand like a tower when everything rocks around him, and when his\nsofter fellow-mortals are winnowed like chaff in the blast.\nThe physiological study of mental conditions is thus the most powerful\nally of hortatory ethics. The hell to be endured hereafter, of which\ntheology tells, is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this\nworld by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could\nthe young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles\nof habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in the\nplastic state. We are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never\nto be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its\nnever so little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson's play,\nexcuses himself for every fresh dereliction by saying, 'I won't count\nthis time!' Well! he may not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count\nit; but it is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve-cells\nand fibres the molecules are counting it, registering and storing it\nup to be used against him when the next temptation comes. Nothing we\never do is, in strict scientific literalness, wiped out. Of course,\nthis has its good side as well as its bad one. As we become permanent\ndrunkards by so many separate drinks, so we become saints in the moral,\nand authorities and experts in the practical and scientific spheres, by\nso many separate acts and hours of work. Let no youth have any anxiety\nabout the upshot of his education, whatever the line of it may be. If\nhe keep faithfully busy each hour of the working-day, he may safely\nleave the final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count\non waking up some fine morning, to find himself one of the competent\nones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he may have singled out.\nSilently, between all the details of his business, the _power of\njudging_ in all that class of matter will have built itself up within\nhim as a possession that will never pass away. Young people should know\nthis truth in advance. The ignorance of it has probably engendered more\ndiscouragement and faint-heartedness in youths embarking on arduous\ncareers than all other causes put together.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[136] This chapter has already appeared in the Popular Science Monthly\nfor February 1887.\n[137] In the sense above explained, which applies to inner structure as\nwell as to outer form.\n[138] Revue Philosophique, i, 324.\n[139] Some paths, to be sure, are banked up by bodies moving through\nthem under too great pressure, and made impervious. These special cases\nwe disregard.\n[140] We cannot say _the will_, for, though many, perhaps most, human\nhabits were once voluntary actions, no action, as we shall see in\na later chapter, can be _primarily_ such. While an habitual action\nmay once have been voluntary, the voluntary action must before that,\nat least once, have been impulsive or reflex.

Mr. Spencer\nthere tries, not only to show how new actions may arise in nervous\nsystems and form new reflex arcs therein, but even how nervous\ntissue may actually be born by the passage of new waves of isometric\ntransformation through an originally indifferent mass.

This sort of vacillation\nin the point of view is a fatal incident of all ordinary talk about\nthese questions; but I must now settle my scores with those readers to\nwhom I already dropped a word in passing (see Footnote 6) and who have\nprobably been dissatisfied with my conduct ever since.\nSuppose we restrict our view to facts of one and the same plane, and\nlet that be the bodily plane: cannot all the outward phenomena of\nintelligence still be exhaustively described? Those mental images,\nthose 'considerations,' whereof we spoke,--presumably they do not\narise without neural processes arising simultaneously with them,\nand presumably each consideration corresponds to a process _sui\ngeneris_, and unlike all the rest. In other words, however numerous\nand delicately differentiated the train of ideas may be, the train\nof brain-events that runs alongside of it must in both respects be\nexactly its match, and we must postulate a neural machinery that offers\na living counterpart for every shading, however fine, of the history\nof its owner's mind. Whatever degree of complication the latter may\nreach, the complication of the machinery must be quite as extreme,\notherwise we should have to admit that there may be mental events to\nwhich no brain-events correspond. But such an admission as this the\nphysiologist is reluctant to make. It would violate all his beliefs.\n'No psychosis without neurosis,' is one form which the principle of\ncontinuity takes in his mind.\nBut this principle forces the physiologist to make still another step.\nIf neural action is as complicated as mind; and if in the sympathetic\nsystem and lower spinal cord we see what, so far as we know, is\nunconscious neural action executing deeds that to all outward intent\nmay be called intelligent; what is there to hinder us from supposing\nthat even where we know consciousness to be there, the still more\ncomplicated neural action which we believe to be its inseparable\ncompanion is alone and of itself the real agent of whatever intelligent\ndeeds may appear? \"As actions of a certain degree of complexity are\nbrought about by mere mechanism, why may not actions of a still greater\ndegree of complexity be the result of a more refined mechanism?\" The\nconception of reflex action is surely one of the best conquests of\nphysiological theory; why not be radical with it? Why not say that just\nas the spinal cord is a machine with few reflexes, so the hemispheres\nare a machine with many, and that that is all the difference? The\nprinciple of continuity would press us to accept this view.\nBut what on this view could be the function of the consciousness\nitself? _Mechanical_ function it would have none. The sense-organs\nwould awaken the brain-cells; these would awaken each other in rational\nand orderly sequence, until the time for action came; and then the last\nbrain-vibration would discharge downward into the motor tracts. But\nthis would be a quite autonomous chain of occurrences, and whatever\nmind went with it would be there only as an 'epiphenomenon,' an inert\nspectator, a sort of 'foam, aura, or melody' as Mr. Hodgson says,\nwhose opposition or whose furtherance would be alike powerless over\nthe occurrences themselves. When talking, some time ago, we ought\nnot, accordingly, _as physiologists_, to have said anything about\n'considerations' as guiding the animal. We ought to have said 'paths\nleft in the hemispherical cortex by former currents,' and nothing more.\nNow so simple and attractive is this conception from the consistently\nphysiological point of view, that it is quite wonderful to see how late\nit was stumbled on in philosophy, and how few people, even when it\nhas been explained to them, fully and easily realize its import. Much\nof the polemic writing against it is by men who have as yet failed to\ntake it into their imaginations. Since this has been the case, it seems\nworth while to devote a few more words to making it plausible, before\ncriticising it ourselves.\nTo Descartes belongs the credit of having first been bold enough to\nconceive of a completely self-sufficing nervous mechanism which should\nbe able to perform complicated and apparently intelligent acts. By a\nsingularly arbitrary restriction, however, Descartes stopped short at\nman, and while contending that in beasts the nervous machinery was all,\nhe held that the higher acts of man were the result of the agency of\nhis rational soul. The opinion that beasts have no consciousness at\nall was of course too paradoxical to maintain itself long as anything\nmore than a curious item in the history of philosophy. And with its\nabandonment the very notion that the nervous system _per se_ might work\nthe work of intelligence, which was an integral, though detachable\npart of the whole theory, seemed also to slip out of men's conception,\nuntil, in this century, the elaboration of the doctrine of reflex\naction made it possible and natural that it should again arise. But it\nwas not till 1870, I believe, that Mr. Hodgson made the decisive step,\nby saying that feelings, no matter how intensely they may be present,\ncan have no causal efficacy whatever, and comparing them to the colors\nlaid on the surface of a mosaic, of which the events in the nervous\nsystem are represented by the stones.[155] Obviously the stones are\nheld in place by each other and not by the several colors which they\nsupport.\nAbout the same time Mr. Spalding, and a little later Messrs. Huxley\nand Clifford, gave great publicity to an identical doctrine,\nthough in their case it was backed by less refined metaphysical\nconsiderations.[156]\nA few sentences from Huxley and Clifford may be subjoined to make the\nmatter entirely clear. Professor Huxley says:\n\"The consciousness of brutes would appear to be related to the\nmechanism of their body simply as a collateral product of its working,\nand to be as completely without any power of modifying that working as\nthe steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine\nis without influence on its machinery. Their volition, if they have\nany, is an emotion _indicative_ of physical changes, not a _cause_ of\nsuch changes.... The soul stands related to the body as the bell of a\nclock to the works, and consciousness answers to the sound which the\nbell gives out when it is struck.... Thus far I have strictly confined\nmyself to the automatism of brutes.... It is quite true that, to the\nbest of my judgment, the argumentation which applies to brutes holds\nequally good of men; and, therefore, that all states of consciousness\nin us, as in them, are immediately caused by molecular changes of the\nbrain-substance. It seems to me that in men, as in brutes, there is\nno proof that any state of consciousness is the cause of change in\nthe motion of the matter of the organism. If these positions are well\nbased, it follows that our mental conditions are simply the symbols\nin consciousness of the changes which take place automatically in the\norganism; and that, to take an extreme illustration, the feeling we\ncall volition is not the cause of a voluntary act, but the symbol of\nthat state of the brain which is the immediate cause of that act. We\nare conscious automata.\"\nProfessor Clifford writes:\n\"All the evidence that we have goes to show that the physical world\ngets along entirely by itself, according to practically universal\nrules.... The train of physical facts between the stimulus sent into\nthe eye, or to any one of our senses, and the exertion which follows\nit, and the train of physical facts which goes on in the brain, even\nwhen there is no stimulus and no exertion,--these are perfectly\ncomplete physical trams, and every step is fully accounted for by\nmechanical conditions.... The two things are on utterly different\nplatforms--the physical facts go along by themselves, and the mental\nfacts go along by themselves. There is a parallelism between them,\nbut there is no interference of one with the other. Again, if anybody\nsays that the will influences matter, the statement is not untrue, but\nit is nonsense. Such an assertion belongs to the crude materialism of\nthe savage. The only thing which influences matter is the position\nof surrounding matter or the motion of surrounding matter.... The\nassertion that another man's volition, a feeling in his consciousness\nthat I cannot perceive, is part of the train of physical facts which\nI may perceive,--this is neither true nor untrue, but nonsense; it\nis a combination of words whose corresponding ideas will not go\ntogether.... Sometimes one series is known better, and sometimes\nthe other; so that in telling a story we speak sometimes of mental\nand sometimes of material facts. A feeling of chill made a man run;\nstrictly speaking, the nervous disturbance which coexisted with that\nfeeling of chill made him run, if we want to talk about material\nfacts; or the feeling of chill produced the form of sub-consciousness\nwhich coexists with the motion of legs, if we want to talk about\nmental facts.... When, therefore, we ask: 'What is the physical link\nbetween the ingoing message from chilled skin and the outgoing message\nwhich moves the leg? 'and the answer is, 'A man's will,' we have as\nmuch right to be amused as if we had asked our friend with the picture\nwhat pigment was used in painting the cannon in the foreground, and\nreceived the answer, 'Wrought iron.' It will be found excellent\npractice in the mental operations required by this doctrine to imagine\na train, the fore part of which is an engine and three carriages\nlinked with iron couplings, and the hind part three other carriages\nlinked with iron couplings; the bond between the two parts being made\nup out of the sentiments of amity subsisting between the stoker and\nthe guard.\"\nTo comprehend completely the consequences of the dogma so confidently\nenunciated, one should unflinchingly apply it to the most complicated\nexamples. The movements of our tongues and pens, the flashings of our\neyes in conversation, are of course events of a material order, and as\nsuch their causal antecedents must be exclusively material. If we knew\nthoroughly the nervous system of Shakespeare, and as thoroughly all\nhis environing conditions, we should be able to show why at a certain\nperiod of his life his hand came to trace on certain sheets of paper\nthose crabbed little black marks which we for shortness' sake call\nthe manuscript of Hamlet. We should understand the rationale of every\nerasure and alteration therein, and we should understand all this\nwithout in the slightest degree acknowledging the existence of the\nthoughts in Shakespeare's mind. The words and sentences would be taken,\nnot as signs of anything beyond themselves, but as little outward\nfacts, pure and simple. In like manner we might exhaustively write\nthe biography of those two hundred pounds, more or less, of warmish\nalbuminoid matter called Martin Luther, without ever implying that it\nfelt.\nBut, on the other hand, nothing in all this could prevent us from\ngiving an equally complete account of either Luther's or Shakespeare's\nspiritual history, an account in which every gleam of thought and\nemotion should find its place. The mind-history would run alongside\nof the body-history of each man, and each point in the one would\ncorrespond to, but not react upon, a point in the other. So the melody\nfloats from the harp-string, but neither checks nor quickens its\nvibrations; so the shadow runs alongside the pedestrian, but in no way\ninfluences his steps.\nAnother inference, apparently more paradoxical still, needs to be\nmade, though, as far as I am aware, Dr. Hodgson is the only writer\nwho has explicitly drawn it. That inference is that feelings, not\ncausing nerve-actions, cannot even cause each other. To ordinary\ncommon sense, felt pain is, as such, not only the cause of outward\ntears and cries, but also the cause of such inward events as sorrow,\ncompunction, desire, or inventive thought. So the consciousness of\ngood news is the direct producer of the feeling of joy, the awareness\nof premises that of the belief in conclusions. But according to\nthe automaton-theory, each of the feelings mentioned is only the\ncorrelate of some nerve-movement whose _cause_ lay wholly in a previous\nnerve-movement. The first nerve-movement called up the second; whatever\nfeeling was attached to the second consequently found itself following\nupon the feeling that was attached to the first. If, for example, good\nnews was the consciousness correlated with the first movement, then\njoy turned out to be the correlate in consciousness of the second.\nBut all the while the items of the nerve series were the only ones in\ncausal continuity; the items of the conscious series, however inwardly\nrational their sequence, were simply juxtaposed.\nREASONS FOR THE THEORY.\nThe 'conscious automaton-theory,' as this conception is generally\ncalled, is thus a radical and simple conception of the manner in\nwhich certain facts may possibly occur. But between conception and\nbelief, proof ought to lie. And when we ask, 'What proves that all\nthis is more than a mere conception of the possible?' it is not easy\nto get a sufficient reply. If we start from the frog's spinal cord and\nreason by continuity, saying, as that acts so intelligently, _though\nunconscious_, so the higher centres, _though conscious_, may have the\nintelligence they show quite as mechanically based; we are immediately\nmet by the exact counter-argument from continuity, an argument actually\nurged by such writers as Pfl\u00fcger and Lewes, which starts from the acts\nof the hemispheres, and says: \"As _these_ owe _their_ intelligence to\nthe consciousness which we know to be there, so the intelligence of\nthe spinal cord's acts must really be due to the invisible presence of\na consciousness lower in degree.\" All arguments from continuity work\nin two ways: you can either level up or level down by their means. And\nit is clear that such arguments as these can eat each other up to all\neternity.\nThere remains a sort of philosophic faith, bred like most faiths from\nan \u00e6sthetic demand. Mental and physical events are, on all hands,\nadmitted to present the strongest contrast in the entire field of\nbeing. The chasm which yawns between them is less easily bridged over\nby the mind than any interval we know. Why, then, not call it an\nabsolute chasm, and say not only that the two worlds are different,\nbut that they are independent? This gives us the comfort of all simple\nand absolute formulas, and it makes each chain homogeneous to our\nconsideration. When talking of nervous tremors and bodily actions, we\nmay feel secure against intrusion from an irrelevant mental world.\nWhen, on the other hand, we speak of feelings, we may with equal\nconsistency use terms always of one denomination, and never be annoyed\nby what Aristotle calls 'slipping into another kind.' The desire on\nthe part of men educated in laboratories not to have their physical\nreasonings mixed up with such incommensurable factors as feelings is\ncertainly very strong. I have heard a most intelligent biologist say:\n\"It is high time for scientific men to protest against the recognition\nof any such thing as consciousness in a scientific investigation.\" In\na word, feeling constitutes the 'unscientific' half of existence, and\nany one who enjoys calling himself a 'scientist' will be too happy to\npurchase an untrammelled homogeneity of terms in the studies of his\npredilection, at the slight cost of admitting a dualism which, in the\nsame breath that it allows to mind an independent status of being,\nbanishes it to a limbo of causal inertness, from whence no intrusion or\ninterruption on its part need ever be feared.\nOver and above this great postulate that matters must be kept simple,\nthere is, it must be confessed, still another highly abstract reason\nfor denying causal efficacity to our feelings. We can form no positive\nimage of the _modus operandi_ of a volition or other thought affecting\nthe cerebral molecules.\n\"Let us try to imagine an idea, say of food, producing a movement, say\nof carrying food to the mouth.... What is the method of its action?\nDoes it assist the decomposition of the molecules of the gray matter,\nor does it retard the process, or does it alter the direction in\nwhich the shocks are distributed? Let us imagine the molecules of the\ngray matter combined in such a way that they will fall into simpler\ncombinations on the impact of an incident force. Now suppose the\nincident force, in the shape of a shock from some other centre, to\nimpinge upon these molecules. By hypothesis it will decompose them,\nand they will fall into the simpler combination. How is the idea of\nfood to prevent this decomposition? Manifestly it can do so only by\nincreasing; the force which binds the molecules together. Good! Try\nto imagine the idea of a beefsteak binding two molecules together.\nIt is impossible. Equally impossible is it to imagine a similar idea\nloosening the attractive force between two molecules.\"[157]\nThis passage from an exceedingly clever writer expresses admirably\nthe difficulty to which I allude. Combined with a strong sense of the\n'chasm' between the two worlds, and with a lively faith in reflex\nmachinery, the sense of this difficulty can hardly fail to make one\nturn consciousness out of the door as a superfluity so far as one's\nexplanations go. One may bow her out politely, allow her to remain as\nan 'epiphenomenon' (invaluable word!), but one insists that matter\nshall hold all the power.\n\"Having thoroughly recognized the fathomless abyss that separates mind\nfrom matter, and having so blended the very notion into his very\nnature that there is no chance of his ever forgetting it or failing\nto saturate with it all his meditations, the student of psychology\nhas next to appreciate the association between these two orders of\nphenomena.... They are associated in a manner so intimate that some\nof the greatest thinkers consider them different aspects of the same\nprocess.... When the rearrangement of molecules takes place in the\nhigher regions of the brain, a change of consciousness simultaneously\noccurs.... The change of consciousness never takes place without the\nchange in the brain; the change in the brain never ... without the\nchange in consciousness. But _why_ the two occur together, or what\nthe link is which connects them, we do not know, and most authorities\nbelieve that we never shall and never can know. Having firmly and\ntenaciously grasped these two notions, of the absolute separateness\nof mind and matter, and of the invariable concomitance of a mental\nchange with a bodily change, the student will enter on the study of\npsychology with half his difficulties surmounted.\"[158]\nHalf his difficulties ignored, I should prefer to say. For this\n'concomitance' in the midst of 'absolute separateness' is an utterly\nirrational notion. It is to my mind quite inconceivable that\nconsciousness should have _nothing to do_ with a business which it\nso faithfully attends. And the question, 'What has it to do?' is one\nwhich psychology has no right to 'surmount,' for it is her plain duty\nto consider it. The fact is that the whole question of interaction\nand influence between things is a metaphysical question, and cannot\nbe discussed at all by those who are unwilling to go into matters\nthoroughly. It is truly enough hard to imagine the 'idea of a beefsteak\nbinding two molecules together;' but since Hume's time it has been\nequally hard to imagine _anything_ binding them together. The whole\nnotion of 'binding' is a mystery, the first step towards the solution\nof which is to clear scholastic rubbish out of the way. Popular\nscience talks of 'forces,' 'attractions' or 'affinities' as binding\nthe molecules; but clear science, though she may use such words to\nabbreviate discourse, has no use for the conceptions, and is satisfied\nwhen she can express in simple 'laws' the bare space-relations of the\nmolecules as functions of each other and of time. To the more curiously\ninquiring mind, however, this simplified expression of the bare facts\nis not enough; there must be a 'reason' for them, and something must\n'determine' the laws. And when one seriously sits down to consider what\nsort of a thing one _means_ when one asks for a 'reason,' one is led so\nfar afield, so far away from popular science and its scholasticism, as\nto see that even such a fact as the existence or non-existence in the\nuniverse of 'the idea of a beefsteak' may not be wholly indifferent to\nother facts in the same universe, and in particular may have something\nto do with determining the distance at which two molecules in that\nuniverse shall lie apart. If this is so, then common-sense, though the\nintimate nature of causality and of the connection of things in the\nuniverse lies beyond her pitifully bounded horizon, has the root and\ngist of the truth in her hands when she obstinately holds to it that\nfeelings and ideas are causes. However inadequate our ideas of causal\nefficacy may be, we are less wide of the mark when we say that our\nideas and feelings have it, than the Automatists are when they say they\nhaven't it. As in the night all cats are gray, so in the darkness of\nmetaphysical criticism all causes are obscure. But one has no right\nto pull the pall over the psychic half of the subject only, as the\nautomatists do, and to say that _that_ causation is unintelligible,\nwhilst in the same breath one dogmatizes about _material_ causation\nas if Hume, Kant, and Lotze had never been born. One cannot thus\nblow hot and cold. One must be impartially _naif_ or impartially\ncritical. If the latter, the reconstruction must be thorough-going or\n'metaphysical,' and will probably preserve the common-sense view that\nideas are forces, in some translated form. But Psychology is a mere\nnatural science, accepting certain terms uncritically as her data, and\nstopping short of metaphysical reconstruction. Like physics, she must\nbe _naive_; and if she finds that in her very peculiar field of study\nideas _seem_ to be causes, she had better continue to talk of them\nas such. She gains absolutely nothing by a breach with common-sense\nin this matter, and she loses, to say the least, all naturalness\nof speech. If feelings are causes, of course their effects must be\nfurtherances and checkings of internal cerebral motions, of which in\nthemselves we are entirely without knowledge. It is probable that for\nyears to come we shall have to infer what happens in the brain either\nfrom our feelings or from motor effects which we observe. The organ\nwill be for us a sort of vat in which feelings and motions somehow go\non stewing together, and in which innumerable things happen of which we\ncatch but the statistical result. Why, under these circumstances, we\nshould be asked to forswear the language of our childhood I cannot well\nimagine, especially as it is perfectly compatible with the language of\nphysiology. The feelings can produce nothing absolutely new, they can\nonly reinforce and inhibit reflex currents which already exist, and the\noriginal organization of these by physiological forces must always be\nthe ground-work of the psychological scheme.\nMy conclusion is that to urge the automaton-theory upon us, as it is\nnow urged, on purely _a priori_ and _quasi-_metaphysical grounds, is an\n_unwarrantable impertinence in the present state of psychology_.\nREASONS AGAINST THE THEORY.\nBut there are much more positive reasons than this why we ought to\ncontinue to talk in psychology as if consciousness had causal efficacy.\nThe _particulars of the distribution of consciousness_, so far as we\nknow them, _point to its being efficacious_. Let us trace some of them.\nIt is very generally admitted, though the point would be hard to prove,\nthat consciousness grows the more complex and intense the higher we\nrise in the animal kingdom. That of a man must exceed that of an\noyster. From this point of view it seems an organ, superadded to the\nother organs which maintain the animal in the struggle for existence;\nand the presumption of course is that it helps him in some way in the\nstruggle, just as they do. But it cannot help him without being in some\nway efficacious and influencing the course of his bodily history. If\nnow it could be shown in what way consciousness _might_ help him, and\nif, moreover, the defects of his other organs (where consciousness is\nmost developed) are such as to make them need just the kind of help\nthat consciousness would bring provided it _were_ efficacious; why,\nthen the plausible inference would be that it came just _because_ of\nits efficacy--in other words, its efficacy would be inductively proved.\nNow the study of the phenomena of consciousness which we shall make\nthroughout the rest of this book will show us that consciousness is\nat all times primarily _a selecting agency_.[159] Whether we take it\nin the lowest sphere of sense, or in the highest of intellection, we\nfind it always doing one thing, choosing one out of several of the\nmaterials so presented to its notice, emphasizing and accentuating that\nand suppressing as far as possible all the rest. The item emphasized is\nalways in close connection with some _interest_ felt by consciousness\nto be paramount at the time.\nBut what are now the defects of the nervous system in those animals\nwhose consciousness seems most highly developed? Chief among them must\nbe _instability_. The cerebral hemispheres are the characteristically\n'high' nerve-centres, and we saw how indeterminate and unforeseeable\ntheir performances were in comparison with those of the basal ganglia\nand the cord. But this very vagueness constitutes their advantage.\nThey allow their possessor to adapt his conduct to the minutest\nalterations in the environing circumstances, any one of which may be\nfor him a sign, suggesting distant motives more powerful than any\npresent solicitations of sense. It seems as if certain mechanical\nconclusions should be drawn from this state of things. An organ,\nswayed by slight impressions is an organ whose natural state is one of\nunstable equilibrium. We may imagine the various lines of discharge\nin the cerebrum to be almost on a par in point of permeability--what\ndischarge a given small impression will produce may be called\n_accidental_, in the sense in which we say it is a matter of accident\nwhether a rain-drop falling on a mountain ridge descend the eastern\nor the western slope. It is in this sense that we may call it a\nmatter of accident whether a child be a boy or a girl. The ovum is so\nunstable a body that certain causes too minute for our apprehension\nmay at a certain moment tip it one way or the other. The natural law\nof an organ constituted after this fashion can be nothing but a law\nof caprice. I do not see how one could reasonably expect from it any\ncertain pursuance of useful lines of reaction, such as the few and\nfatally determined performances of the lower centres constitute within\ntheir narrow sphere. The dilemma in regard to the nervous system seems,\nin short, to be of the following kind. We may construct one which\nwill react infallibly and certainly, but it will then be capable of\nreacting to very few changes in the environment--it will fail to be\nadapted to all the rest. We may, on the other hand, construct a nervous\nsystem potentially adapted to respond to an infinite variety of minute\nfeatures in the situation; but its fallibility will then be as great\nas its elaboration. We can never be sure that its equilibrium will\nbe upset in the appropriate direction. In short, a high brain may do\nmany things, and may do each of them at a very slight hint. But its\nhair-trigger organization makes of it a happy-go-lucky, hit-or-miss\naffair. It is as likely to do the crazy as the sane thing at any given\nmoment. A low brain does few things, and in doing them perfectly\nforfeits all other use. The performances of a high brain are like dice\nthrown forever on a table. Unless they be loaded, what chance is there\nthat the highest number will turn up oftener than the lowest?\nAll this is said of the brain as a physical machine pure and simple.\n_Can consciousness increase its efficiency by loading its dice?_ Such\nis the problem.\nLoading its dice would mean bringing a more or less constant pressure\nto bear in favor of _those_ of its performances which make for the most\npermanent interests cf the brain's owner; it would mean a constant\ninhibition of the tendencies to stray aside.\nWell, just such pressure and such inhibition are what consciousness\n_seems_ to be exerting all the while. And the interests in whose favor\nit seems to exert them are _its_ interests and its alone, interests\nwhich it _creates_, and which, but for it, would have no status in the\nrealm of being whatever. We talk, it is true, when we are darwinizing,\nas if the mere _body_ that owns the brain had interests; we speak\nabout the utilities of its various organs and how they help or hinder\nthe body's survival; and we treat the survival as if it were an\nabsolute end, existing as such in the physical world, a sort of actual\n_should-be_, presiding over the animal and judging his reactions,\nquite apart from the presence of any commenting intelligence outside.\nWe forget that in the absence of some such superadded commenting\nintelligence (whether it be that of the animal itself, or only ours\nor Mr. Darwin's), the reactions cannot be properly talked of as\n'useful' or 'hurtful' at all. Considered merely physically, all that\ncan be said of them is that _if_ they occur in a certain way survival\nwill as a matter of fact prove to be their incidental consequence.\nThe organs themselves, and all the rest of the physical world, will,\nhowever, all the time be quite indifferent to this consequence, and\nwould quite as cheerfully, the circumstances changed, compass the\nanimal's destruction. In a word, survival can enter into a purely\nphysiological discussion only as an _hypothesis made by an onlooker_,\nabout the future. But the moment you bring a consciousness into the\nmidst, survival ceases to be a mere hypothesis. No longer is it, \"_if_\nsurvival is to occur, then so and so must brain and other organs work.\"\nIt has now become an imperative decree: \"Survival _shall_ occur, and\ntherefore organs _must_ so work!\" _Real_ ends appear for the first\ntime now upon the world's stage. The conception of consciousness as a\npurely cognitive form of being, which is the pet way of regarding it\nin many idealistic schools, modern as well as ancient, is thoroughly\nanti-psychological, as the remainder of this book will show. Every\nactually existing consciousness seems to itself at any rate to be a\n_fighter for ends_, of which many, but for its presence, would not be\nends at all. Its powers of cognition are mainly subservient to these\nends, discerning which facts further them and which do not.\nNow let consciousness only be what it seems to itself, and it will help\nan instable brain to compass its proper ends. The movements of the\nbrain _per se_ yield the means of attaining these ends mechanically,\nbut only out of a lot of other ends, if so they may be called, which\nare not the proper ones of the animal, but often quite opposed. The\nbrain is an instrument of possibilities, but of no certainties. But the\nconsciousness, with its own ends present to it, and knowing also well\nwhich possibilities lead thereto and which away, will, if endowed with\ncausal efficacy, reinforce the favorable possibilities and repress the\nunfavorable or indifferent ones. The nerve-currents, coursing through\nthe cells and fibres, must in this case be supposed strengthened by\nthe fact of their awaking one consciousness and dampened by awaking\nanother. _How_ such reaction of the consciousness upon the currents may\noccur must remain at present unsolved: it is enough for my purpose to\nhave shown that it may not uselessly exist, and that the matter is less\nsimple than the brain-automatists hold.\nAll the facts of the natural history of consciousness lend color\nto this view. Consciousness, for example, is only intense when\nnerve-processes are hesitant. In rapid, automatic, habitual action\nit sinks to a minimum. Nothing could be more fitting than this, if\nconsciousness have the teleological function we suppose; nothing more\nmeaningless, if not. Habitual actions are certain, and being in no\ndanger of going astray from their end, need no extraneous help. In\nhesitant action, there seem many alternative possibilities of final\nnervous discharge. The feeling awakened by the nascent excitement of\neach alternative nerve-tract seems by its attractive or repulsive\nquality to determine whether the excitement shall abort or shall become\ncomplete. Where indecision is great, as before a dangerous leap,\nconsciousness is agonizingly intense. Feeling, from this point of view,\nmay be likened to a cross-section of the chain of nervous discharge,\nascertaining the links already laid down, and groping among the fresh\nends presented to it for the one which seems best to fit the case.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe phenomena of 'vicarious function' which we studied in Chapter II\nseem to form another bit of circumstantial evidence. A machine in\nworking order acts fatally in one way. Our consciousness calls this the\nright way. Take out a valve, throw a wheel out of gear or bend a pivot,\nand it becomes a different machine, acting just as fatally in another\nway which we call the wrong way. But the machine itself knows nothing\nof wrong or right: matter has no ideals to pursue. A locomotive will\ncarry its train through an open drawbridge as cheerfully as to any\nother destination.\nA brain with part of it scooped out is virtually a new machine, and\nduring the first days after the operation functions in a thoroughly\nabnormal manner. As a matter of fact, however, its performances\nbecome from day to day more normal, until at last a practised eye\nmay be needed to suspect anything wrong. Some of the restoration is\nundoubtedly due to 'inhibitions' passing away. But if the consciousness\nwhich goes with the rest of the brain, be there not only in order\nto take cognizance of each functional error, but also to exert\nan efficient pressure to check it if it be a sin of commission,\nand to lend a strengthening hand if it be a weakness or sin of\nomission,--nothing seems more natural than that the remaining parts,\nassisted in this way, should by virtue of the principle of habit grow\nback to the old teleological modes of exercise for which they were at\nfirst incapacitated. Nothing, on the contrary, seems at first sight\nmore unnatural than that they should vicariously take up the duties of\na part now lost without those _duties as such_ exerting any persuasive\nor coercive force. At the end of Chapter XXVI I shall return to this\nagain.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThere is yet another set of facts which seem explicable on the\nsupposition that consciousness has causal efficacy. _It is a well-known\nfact that pleasures are generally associated with beneficial, pains\nwith detrimental, experiences._ All the fundamental vital processes\nillustrate this law. Starvation, suffocation, privation of food, drink\nand sleep, work when exhausted, burns, wounds, inflammation, the\neffects of poison, are as disagreeable as filling the hungry stomach,\nenjoying rest and sleep after fatigue, exercise after rest, and a\nsound skin and unbroken bones at all times, are pleasant. Mr. Spencer\nand others have suggested that these coincidences are due, not to any\npre-established harmony, but to the mere action of natural selection\nwhich would certainly kill off in the long-run any breed of creatures\nto whom the fundamentally noxious experience seemed enjoyable. An\nanimal that should take pleasure in a feeling of suffocation would, if\nthat pleasure were efficacious enough to make him immerse his head in\nwater, enjoy a longevity of four or five minutes. But if pleasures and\npains have no efficacy, one does not see (without some such _a priori_\nrational harmony as would be scouted by the 'scientific' champions\nof the automaton-theory) why the most noxious acts, such as burning,\nmight not give thrills of delight, and the most necessary ones, such\nas breathing, cause agony. The exceptions to the law are, it is true,\nnumerous, but relate to experiences that are either not vital or not\nuniversal. Drunkenness, for instance, which though noxious, is to many\npersons delightful, is a very exceptional experience. But, as the\nexcellent physiologist Pick remarks, if all rivers and springs ran\nalcohol instead of water, either all men would now be born to hate it\nor our nerves would have been selected so as to drink it with impunity.\nThe only considerable attempt, in fact, that has been made to explain\nthe _distribution_ of our feelings is that of Mr. Grant Allen in his\nsuggestive little work _Physiological \u00c6sthetics_; and his reasoning is\nbased exclusively on that causal efficacy of pleasures and pains which\nthe 'double-aspect' partisans so strenuously deny.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThus, then, from every point of view the circumstantial evidence\nagainst that theory is strong. _A priori_ analysis of both brain-action\nand conscious action shows us that if the latter were efficacious it\nwould, by its selective emphasis, make amends for the indeterminateness\nof the former; whilst the study _a posteriori_ of the _distribution_\nof consciousness shows it to be exactly such as we might expect in an\norgan added for the sake of steering a nervous system grown too complex\nto regulate itself. The conclusion that it is useful is, after all\nthis, quite justifiable. But, if it is useful, it must be so through\nits causal efficaciousness, and the automaton-theory must succumb\nto the theory of common-sense. I, at any rate (pending metaphysical\nreconstructions not yet successfully achieved), shall have no\nhesitation in using the language of common-sense throughout this book.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[155] The Theory of Practice, vol. i, p. 416 ff.\n[156] The present writer recalls how in 1869, when still a medical\nstudent, he began to write an essay showing how almost every one who\nspeculated about brain-processes illicitly interpolated into his\naccount of them links derived from the entirely heterogeneous universe\nof Feeling. Spencer, Hodgson (in his Time and Space), Maudsley,\nLockhart Clarke, Bain, Dr. S. Carpenter, and other authors were cited\nas having been guilty of the confusion. The writing was soon stopped\nbecause he perceived that the view which he was upholding against these\nauthors was a pure conception, with no proofs to be adduced of its\nreality. Later it seemed to him that whatever _proofs_ existed really\ntold in favor of their view.\n[157] Chas. Mercier: The Nervous System and the Mind (1888), p. 9.\n[158] _Op. cit._ p. 11.\n[159] See in particular the end of Chapter IX.\nCHAPTER VI.\nTHE MIND-STUFF THEORY.\nThe reader who found himself swamped with too much metaphysics in the\nlast chapter will have a still worse time of it in this one, which is\nexclusively metaphysical. Metaphysics means nothing but an unusually\nobstinate effort to think clearly. The fundamental conceptions of\npsychology are practically very clear to us, but theoretically they are\nvery confused, and one easily makes the obscurest assumptions in this\nscience without realizing, until challenged, what internal difficulties\nthey involve. When these assumptions have once established themselves\n(as they have a way of doing in our very descriptions of the phenomenal\nfacts) it is almost impossible to get rid of them afterwards or to make\nany one see that they are not essential features of the subject. The\nonly way to prevent this disaster is to scrutinize them beforehand and\nmake them give an articulate account of themselves before letting them\npass. One of the obscurest of the assumptions of which I speak is _the\nassumption that our mental states are composite in structure, made up\nof smaller states conjoined_. This hypothesis has outward advantages\nwhich make it almost irresistibly attractive to the intellect, and\nyet it is inwardly quite unintelligible. Of its unintelligibility,\nhowever, half the writers on psychology seem unaware. As our own aim is\n_to understand_ if possible, I make no apology for singling out this\nparticular notion for very explicit treatment before taking up the\ndescriptive part of our work. _The theory of 'mind-stuff' is the theory\nthat our mental states are compounds_, expressed in its most radical\nform.\nEVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY DEMANDS A MIND-DUST.\nIn a general theory of evolution the inorganic comes first, then the\nlowest forms of animal and vegetable life, then forms of life that\npossess mentality, and finally those like ourselves that possess it\nin a high degree. As long as we keep to the consideration of purely\noutward facts, even the most complicated facts of biology, our task\nas evolutionists is comparatively easy. We are dealing all the time\nwith matter and its aggregations and separations; and although our\ntreatment must perforce be hypothetical, this does not prevent it from\nbeing _continuous_. The point which as evolutionists we are bound\nto hold fast to is that all the new forms of being that make their\nappearance are really nothing more than results of the redistribution\nof the original and unchanging materials. The self-same atoms which,\nchaotically dispersed, made the nebula, now, jammed and temporarily\ncaught in peculiar positions, form our brains; and the 'evolution' of\nthe brains, if understood, would be simply the account of how the atoms\ncame to be so caught and jammed. In this story no new _natures_, no\nfactors not present at the beginning, are introduced at any later stage.\nBut with the dawn of consciousness an entirely new nature seems to slip\nin, something whereof the potency was _not_ given in the mere outward\natoms of the original chaos.\nThe enemies of evolution have been quick to pounce upon this undeniable\ndiscontinuity in the data of the world and many of them, from the\nfailure of evolutionary explanations at this point, have inferred their\ngeneral incapacity all along the line. Every one admits the entire\nincommensurability of feeling as such with material motion as such.\n\"A motion became a feeling!\"--no phrase that our lips can frame is\nso devoid of apprehensible meaning. Accordingly, even the vaguest of\nevolutionary enthusiasts, when deliberately comparing material with\nmental facts, have been as forward as any one else to emphasize the\n'chasm' between the inner and the outer worlds.\n\"Can the oscillations of a molecule,\" says Mr. Spencer, \"be\nrepresented side by side with a nervous shock [he means a mental\nshock], and the two be recognized as one? No effort enables us to\nassimilate them. That a unit of feeling has nothing in common with a\nunit of motion becomes more than ever manifest when we bring the two\ninto juxtaposition.\"[160]\nAnd again:\n\"Suppose it to have become quite clear that a shock in consciousness\nand a molecular motion are the subjective and objective faces of the\nsame thing; we continue utterly incapable of uniting the two, so as to\nconceive that reality of which they are the opposite faces.\"[161]\nIn other words, incapable of perceiving in them any common character.\nSo Tyndall, in that lucky paragraph which has been quoted so often that\nevery one knows it by heart:\n\"The passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts\nof consciousness is unthinkable. Granted that a definite thought and\na definite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously; we do\nnot possess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the\norgan, which would enable us to pass, by a process of reasoning, from\none to the other.\"[162]\nOr in this other passage:\n\"We can trace the development of a nervous system and correlate with\nit the parallel phenomena of sensation and thought. We see with\nundoubting certainty that they go hand in hand. But we try to soar\nin a vacuum the moment we seek to comprehend the connection between\nthem.... There is no fusion possible between the two classes of\nfacts--no motor energy in the intellect of man to carry it without\nlogical rupture from the one to the other.\"[163]\nNone the less easily, however, when the evolutionary afflatus is upon\nthem, do the very same writers leap over the breach whose flagrancy\nthey are the foremost to announce, and talk as if mind grew out of body\nin a continuous way. Mr. Spencer, looking back on his review of mental\nevolution, tells us how \"in tracing up the increase we found ourselves\npassing _without break_ from the phenomena of bodily life to the\nphenomena of mental life.\"[164] And Mr. Tyndall, in the same Belfast\nAddress from which we just quoted, delivers his other famous passage:\n\"Abandoning all disguise, the confession that I feel bound to make\nbefore you is that I prolong the vision backward across the boundary\nof the experimental evidence, and discern in that matter which we,\nin our ignorance and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its\nCreator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium the promise and potency\nof every form and quality of life.\"[165]\n--mental life included, as a matter of course.\nSo strong a postulate is continuity! Now this book will tend to show\nthat mental postulates are on the whole to be respected. The demand for\ncontinuity has, over large tracts of science, proved itself to possess\ntrue prophetic power. We ought therefore ourselves sincerely to try\nevery possible mode of conceiving the dawn of consciousness so that it\nmay _not_ appear equivalent to the irruption into the universe of a new\nnature, non-existent until then.\nMerely to call the consciousness 'nascent' will not serve our\nturn.[166] It is true that the word signifies not yet _quite_ born,\nand so seems to form a sort of bridge between existence and nonentity.\nBut that is a verbal quibble. The fact is that discontinuity comes\nin if a new nature comes in at all. The _quantity_ of the latter is\nquite immaterial. The girl in 'Midshipman Easy' could not excuse the\nillegitimacy of her child by saying, 'it was a little small one.'\nAnd Consciousness, however little, is an illegitimate birth in any\nphilosophy that starts without it, and yet professes to explain all\nfacts by continuous evolution.\n_If evolution is to work smoothly, consciousness in some shape must\nhave been present at the very origin of things._ Accordingly we find\nthat the more clear-sighted evolutionary philosophers are beginning\nto posit it there. Each atom of the nebula, they suppose, must have\nhad an aboriginal atom of consciousness linked with it; and, just\nas the material atoms have formed bodies and brains by massing\nthemselves together, so the mental atoms, by an analogous process of\naggregation, have fused into those larger consciousnesses which we know\nin ourselves and suppose to exist in our fellow-animals. Some such\ndoctrine of _atomistic hylozoism_ as this is an indispensable part of a\nthorough-going philosophy of evolution. According to it there must be\nan infinite number of degrees of consciousness, following the degrees\nof complication and aggregation of the primordial mind-dust. To prove\nthe separate existence of these degrees of consciousness by indirect\nevidence, since direct intuition of them is not to be had, becomes\ntherefore the first duty of psychological evolutionism.\nSOME ALLEGED PROOFS THAT MIND-DUST EXISTS.\nSome of this duty we find already performed by a number of philosophers\nwho, though not interested at all in evolution, have nevertheless on\nindependent grounds convinced themselves of the existence of a vast\namount of sub-conscious mental life. The criticism of this general\nopinion and its grounds will have to be postponed for a while. At\npresent let us merely deal with the arguments assumed to prove\naggregation of bits of mind-stuff into distinctly sensible feelings.\nThey are clear and admit of a clear reply.\nThe German physiologist A. Fick, in 1862, was, so far as I know, the\nfirst to use them. He made experiments on the discrimination of the\nfeelings of warmth and of touch, when only a very small portion of the\nskin was excited through a hole in a card, the surrounding parts being\nprotected by the card. He found that under these circumstances mistakes\nwere frequently made by the patient,[167] and concluded that this must\nbe because the number of sensations from the elementary nerve-tips\naffected was too small to sum itself distinctly into either of the\nqualities of feeling in question. He tried to show how a different\nmanner of the summation might give rise in one case to the heat and in\nanother to the touch.\n\"A feeling of temperature,\" he says, \"arises when the intensities of\nthe units of feeling are evenly gradated, so that between two elements\n_a_ and _b_ no other unit can spatially intervene whose intensity is\nnot also _between_ that of _a_ and _b_. A feeling of contact perhaps\narises when this condition is not fulfilled. Both kinds of feeling,\nhowever, are composed of the same units.\"\nBut it is obviously far clearer to interpret such a gradation of\nintensities as a brain-fact than as a mind-fact. If in the brain a\ntract were first excited in one of the ways suggested by Prof. Fick,\nand then again in the other, it might very well happen, for aught\nwe can say to the contrary, that the psychic accompaniment in the\none case would be heat, and in the other pain. The pain and the heat\nwould, however, not be composed of psychic units, but would each be\nthe direct result of one total brain-process. So long as this latter\ninterpretation remains open, Fick cannot be held to have proved psychic\nsummation.\nLater, both Spencer and Taine, independently of each other, took up\nthe same line of thought. Mr. Spencer's reasoning is worth quoting _in\nextenso_. He writes:\n\"Although the individual sensations and emotions, real or ideal,\nof which consciousness is built up, appear to be severally simple,\nhomogeneous, unanalyzable, or of inscrutable natures, yet they are\nnot so. There is at least one kind of feeling which, as ordinarily\nexperienced, seems elementary, that is demonstrably not elementary.\nAnd after resolving it into its proximate components, we can scarcely\nhelp suspecting that other apparently-elementary feelings are also\ncompound, and may have proximate components like those which we can in\nthis one instance identify.\n\"Musical sound is the name we give to this seemingly simple feeling\nwhich is clearly resolvable into simpler feelings. Well-known\nexperiments prove that when equal blows or taps are made one after\nanother at a rate not exceeding some sixteen per second, the effect\nof each is perceived as a separate noise; but when the rapidity with\nwhich the blows follow one another exceeds this, the noises are no\nlonger identified in separate states of consciousness, and there\narises in place of them a continuous state of consciousness, called\na tone. In further increasing the rapidity of the blows, the tone\nundergoes the change of quality distinguished as rise in pitch; and\nit continues to rise in pitch as the blows continue to increase in\nrapidity, until it reaches an acuteness beyond which it is no longer\nappreciable as a tone. So that out of units of feeling of the same\nkind, many feelings distinguishable from one another in quality\nresult, according as the units are more or less integrated.\n\"This is not all. The inquiries of Professor Helmholtz have shown\nthat when, along with one series of these rapidly-recurring noises,\nthere is generated another series in which the noises are more rapid\nthough not so loud, the effect is a change in that quality known as\nits _timbre_. As various musical instruments show us, tones which are\nalike in pitch and strength are distinguishable by their harshness or\nsweetness, their ringing or their liquid characters; and all their\nspecific peculiarities are proved to arise from the combination\nof one, two, three, or more, supplementary series of recurrent\nnoises with the chief series of recurrent noises. So that while the\nunlikenesses of feeling known as differences of pitch in tones are\ndue to differences of integration among the recurrent noises of one\nseries, the unlikenesses of feeling known as differences of _timbre_,\nare due to the simultaneous integration with this series of other\nseries having other degrees of integration. And thus an enormous\nnumber of qualitatively-contrasted kinds of consciousness that seem\nseverally elementary prove to be composed of one simple kind of\nconsciousness, combined and recombined with itself in multitudinous\nways.\n\"Can we stop short here? If the different sensations known as sounds\nare built out of a common unit, is it not to be rationally inferred\nthat so likewise are the different sensations known as tastes, and\nthe different sensations known as odors, and the different sensations\nknown as colors? Nay, shall we not regard it as probable that there is\na unit common to all these strongly-contrasted classes of sensations?\nIf the unlikenesses among the sensations of each class may be due to\nunlikenesses among the modes of aggregation of a unit of consciousness\ncommon to them all; so too may the much greater unlikenesses between\nthe sensations of each class and those of other classes. There may be\na single primordial element of consciousness, and the countless kinds\nof consciousness may be produced by the compounding of this element\nwith itself and the recompounding of its compounds with one another\nin higher and higher degrees: so producing increased multiplicity,\nvariety, and complexity.\n\"Have we any clue to this primordial element? I think we have. That\nsimple mental impression which proves to be the unit of composition\nof the sensation of musical tone, is allied to certain other simple\nmental impressions differently originated. The subjective effect\nproduced by a crack or noise that has no appreciable duration is\nlittle else than a nervous shock. Though we distinguish such a nervous\nshock as belonging to what we call sounds, yet it does not differ very\nmuch from nervous shocks of other kinds. An electric discharge sent\nthrough the body causes a feeling akin to that which a sudden loud\nreport causes. A strong unexpected impression made through the eyes,\nas by a flash of lightning, similarly gives rise to a start or shock;\nand though the feeling so named seems, like the electric shock, to\nhave the body at large for its seat, and may therefore be regarded\nas the correlative rather of the efferent than of the afferent\ndisturbance, yet on remembering the mental change that results from\nthe instantaneous transit of an object across the field of vision, I\nthink it may be perceived that the feeling accompanying the efferent\ndisturbance is itself reduced very nearly to the same form. The state\nof consciousness so generated is, in fact, comparable in quality to\nthe initial state of consciousness caused by a blow (distinguishing\nit from the pain or other feeling that commences the instant after);\nwhich state of consciousness caused by a blow may be taken as the\nprimitive and typical form of the nervous shock. The fact that sudden\nbrief disturbances thus set up by different stimuli through different\nsets of nerves cause feelings scarcely distinguishable in quality\nwill not appear strange when we recollect that distinguishableness of\nfeeling implies appreciable duration; and that when the duration is\ngreatly abridged, nothing more is known than that some mental change\nhas occurred and ceased. To have a sensation of redness, to know a\ntone as acute or grave, to be conscious of a taste as sweet, implies\nin each case a considerable continuity of state. If the state does\nnot last long enough to admit of its being contemplated, it cannot be\nclassed as of this or that kind; and becomes a momentary modification\nvery similar to momentary modifications otherwise caused.\n\"It is possible, then--may we not even say probable?--that something\nof the same order as that which we call a nervous shock is the\nultimate unit of consciousness; and that all the unlikenesses\namong our feelings result from unlike modes of integration of this\nultimate unit. I say of the same order, because there are discernible\ndifferences among nervous shocks that are differently caused; and\nthe primitive nervous shock probably differs somewhat from each of\nthem. And I say of the same order, for the further reason that while\nwe may ascribe to them a general likeness in nature, we must suppose\na great unlikeness in degree. The nervous shocks recognized as such\nare violent--must be violent before they can be perceived amid the\nprocession of multitudinous vivid feelings suddenly interrupted by\nthem. But the rapidly-recurring nervous shocks of which the different\nforms of feeling consist, we must assume to be of comparatively\nmoderate, or even of very slight intensity. Were our various\nsensations and emotions composed of rapidly-recurring shocks as strong\nas those ordinarily called shocks, they would be unbearable; indeed\nlife would cease at once. We must think of them rather as successive\nfaint pulses of subjective change, each having the same quality as\nthe strong pulse of subjective change distinguished as a nervous\nshock.\"[168]\nINSUFFICIENCY OF THESE PROOFS.\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\nConvincing as this argument of Mr. Spencer's may appear on a first\nreading, it is singular how weak it really is.[169] We do, it is true,\nwhen we study the connection between a musical note and its outward\ncause, find the note simple and continuous while the cause is multiple\nand discrete. Somewhere, then, there _is_ a transformation, reduction,\nor fusion. The question is, Where?--in the nerve-world or in the\nmind-world? Really we have no experimental proof by which to decide;\nand if decide we must, analogy and _a priori_ probability can alone\nguide us. Mr. Spencer assumes that the fusion must come to pass in the\nmental world, and that the physical processes get through air and ear,\nauditory nerve and medulla, lower brain and hemispheres, without their\nnumber being reduced. Figure 25 will make the point clear.\nLet the line _a--b_ represent the threshold of consciousness: then\neverything drawn below that line will symbolize a physical process,\neverything above it will mean a fact of mind. Let the crosses stand\nfor the physical blows, the circles for the events in successively\nhigher orders of nerve-cells, and the horizontal marks for the facts of\nfeeling. Spencer's argument implies that each order of cells transmits\njust as many impulses as it receives to the cells above it; so that if\nthe blows come at the rate of 20,000 in a second the cortical cells\ndischarge at the same rate, and one unit of feeling corresponds to each\none of the 20,000 discharges. Then, and only then, does 'integration'\noccur, by the 20,000 units of feeling 'compounding with themselves'\ninto the 'continuous state of consciousness' represented by the short\nline at the top of the figure.\nNow such an interpretation as this flies in the face of physical\nanalogy, no less than of logical intelligibility. Consider physical\nanalogy first,\nA pendulum may be deflected by a single blow, and swing back. Will\nit swing back the more often the more we multiply the blows? No; for\nif they rain upon the pendulum too fast, it will not swing at all\nbut remain deflected in a sensibly stationary state. In other words,\nincreasing the cause numerically need not equally increase numerically\nthe effect. Blow through a tube: you get a certain musical note; and\nincreasing the blowing increases for a certain time the loudness of\nthe note. Will this be true indefinitely? No; for when a certain force\nis reached, the note, instead of growing louder, suddenly disappears\nand is replaced by its higher octave. Turn on the gas slightly and\nlight it: you get a tiny flame. Turn on more gas, and the breadth\nof the flame increases. Will this relation increase indefinitely?\nNo, again; for at a certain moment up shoots the flame into a ragged\nstreamer and begins to hiss. Send slowly through the nerve of a\nfrog's gastrocnemius muscle a succession of galvanic shocks: you get\na succession of twitches. Increasing the number of shocks does not\nincrease the twitching; on the contrary, it stops it, and we have\nthe muscle in the apparently stationary state of contraction called\ntetanus. This last fact is the true analogue of what must happen\nbetween the nerve-cell and the sensory fibre. It is certain that cells\nare more inert than fibres, and that rapid vibrations in the latter can\nonly arouse relatively simple processes or states in the former. The\nhigher cells may have even a slower rate of explosion than the lower,\nand so the twenty thousand supposed blows of the outer air may be\n'integrated' in the cortex into a very small number of cell-discharges\nin a second. This other diagram will serve to contrast this supposition\nwith Spencer's. In Fig. 26 all 'integration' occurs below the threshold\nof consciousness. The frequency of cell-events becomes more and more\nreduced as we approach the cells to which feeling is most directly\nattached, until at last we come to a condition of things symbolized by\nthe larger ellipse, which may be taken to stand for some rather massive\nand slow process of tension and discharge in the cortical centres, to\nwhich, _as a whole_, the feeling of musical tone symbolized by the line\nat the top of the diagram _simply and totally_ corresponds. It is as if\na long file of men were to start one after the other to reach a distant\npoint. The road at first is good and they keep their original distance\napart. Presently it is intersected by bogs each worse than the last,\nso that the front men get so retarded that the hinder ones catch up\nwith them before the journey is done, and all arrive together at the\ngoal.[170]\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\nOn this supposition there _are_ no unperceived units of mind-stuff\npreceding and composing the full consciousness. The latter is itself\nan immediate psychic fact and bears an immediate relation to the\nneural state which is its unconditional accompaniment. Did each neural\nshock give rise to its own psychic shock, and the psychic shocks then\ncombine, it would be impossible to understand why severing one part of\nthe central nervous system from another should break up the integrity\nof the consciousness. The cut has nothing to do with the psychic world.\nThe atoms of mind-stuff ought to float off from the nerve-matter on\neither side of it, and come together over it and fuse, just as well\nas if it had not been made. We know, however, that they do not; that\nseverance of the paths of conduction between a man's left auditory\ncentre or optical centre and the rest of his cortex will sever all\ncommunication between the words which he hears or sees written and the\nrest of his ideas.\nMoreover, if feelings can mix into a _tertium quid_, why do we not\ntake a feeling of greenness and a feeling of redness, and make a\nfeeling of yellowness out of them? Why has optics neglected the open\nroad to truth, and wasted centuries in disputing about theories of\ncolor-composition which two minutes of introspection would have settled\nforever[171] We cannot mix feelings as such, though we may mix the\nobjects we feel, and from _their_ mixture get new feelings. We cannot\neven (as we shall later see) have two feelings in our mind at once. At\nmost we can compare together _objects previously presented_ to us in\ndistinct feelings; but then we find each object stubbornly maintaining\nits separate identity before consciousness, whatever the verdict of the\ncomparison may be.[172]\nSELF-COMPOUNDING OF MENTAL FACTS IS INADMISSIBLE.\nBut there is a still more fatal objection to the theory of mental\nunits 'compounding with themselves' or 'integrating.' It is logically\nunintelligible; it leaves out the essential feature of all the\n'combinations' we actually know.\n_All the 'combinations' which we actually know are_ EFFECTS, _wrought\nby the units said to be 'combined,'_ UPON SOME ENTITY OTHER THAN\nTHEMSELVES. Without this feature of a medium or vehicle, the notion of\ncombination has no sense.\n\"A multitude of contractile units, by joint action, and by being\nall connected, for instance, with a single tendon, will pull at the\nsame, and will bring about a dynamical effect which is undoubtedly\nthe resultant of their combined individual energies.... On the whole,\ntendons are to muscular fibres, and bones are to tendons, combining\nrecipients of mechanical energies. A medium of composition is\nindispensable to the summation of energies. To realize the complete\ndependence of mechanical resultants on a combining substratum, one may\nfancy for a moment all the individually contracting muscular elements\nsevered from their attachments. They might then still be capable\nof contracting with the same energy as before, yet no co-operative\nresult would be accomplished. The medium of dynamical combination\nwould be wanting. The multiple energies, singly exerted on no common\nrecipient, would lose themselves on entirely isolated and disconnected\nefforts.\"[173]\nIn other words, no possible number of entities (call them as you\nlike, whether forces, material particles, or mental elements) can\nsum _themselves_ together. Each remains, in the sum, what it always\nwas; and the sum itself exists only _for a bystander_ who happens to\noverlook the units and to apprehend the sum as such; or else it exists\nin the shape of some other _effect_ on an entity external to the sum\nitself. Let it not be objected that H_{2} and O combine of themselves\ninto 'water,' and thenceforward exhibit new properties. They do not.\nThe 'water' is just the old atoms in the new position, H-O-H; the 'new\nproperties' are just their combined _effects_, when in this position,\nupon external media, such as our sense-organs and the various reagents\non which water may exert its properties and be known.\n\"Aggregations are organized wholes only when they behave as such in\nthe presence of other things. A statue is an aggregation of particles\nof marble, but as such it has no unity. For the spectator it is one;\nin itself it is an aggregate; just as, to the consciousness of an ant\ncrawling over it, it may again appear a mere aggregate. No summing up\nof parts can make an unity of a mass of discrete constituents, unless\nthis unity exist for some other subject, not for the mass itself.\"[174]\nJust so, in the parallelogram of forces, the 'forces' themselves do\nnot combine into the diagonal resultant; a _body_ is needed on which\nthey may impinge, to exhibit their resultant effect. No more do musical\nsounds combine _per se_ into concords or discords. Concord and discord\nare names for their combined effects on that external medium, the\n_ear_.\nWhere the elemental units are supposed to be feelings, the case is in\nno wise altered. Take a hundred of them, shuffle them and pack them as\nclose together as you can (whatever that may mean); still each remains\nthe same feeling it always was, shut in its own skin, windowless,\nignorant of what the other feelings are and mean. There would be a\nhundred-and-first feeling there, if, when a group or series of such\nfeelings were set up, a consciousness _belonging to the group as such_\nshould emerge. And this 101st feeling would be a totally new fact; the\n100 original feelings might, by a curious physical law, be a signal\nfor its _creation_, when they came together; but they would have no\nsubstantial identity with it, nor it with them, and one could never\ndeduce the one from the others, or (in any intelligible sense) say that\nthey _evolved_ it.\nTake a sentence of a dozen words, and take twelve men and tell to each\none word. Then stand the men in a row or jam them in a bunch, and let\neach think of his word as intently as he will; nowhere will there be\na consciousness of the whole sentence.[175] We talk of the 'spirit of\nthe age,' and the 'sentiment of the people,' and in various ways we\nhypostatize 'public opinion.' But we know this to be symbolic speech,\nand never dream that the spirit, opinion, sentiment, etc., constitute\na consciousness other than, and additional to, that of the several\nindividuals whom the words 'age,' 'people,' or 'public' denote. The\nprivate minds do not agglomerate into a higher compound mind. This has\nalways been the invincible contention of the spiritualists against the\nassociationists in Psychology,--a contention which we shall take up\nat greater length in Chapter X. The associationists say the mind is\nconstituted by a multiplicity of distinct 'ideas' _associated_ into\na unity. There is, they say, an idea of _a_, and also an idea of _b.\nTherefore,_ they say, there is an idea of _a_ + _b_, or of _a_ and _b_\ntogether. Which is like saying that the mathematical square of _a_ plus\nthat of _b_ is equal to the square of _a_ + _b_, a palpable untruth.\nIdea of _a_ + idea of _b_ is _not_ identical with idea of (_a_ + _b_).\nIt is one, they are two; in it, what knows _a_ also knows _b_; in them,\nwhat knows _a_ is expressly posited as not knowing _b_; etc. In short,\nthe two separate ideas can never by any logic be made to figure as one\nand the same thing as the 'associated' idea.\nThis is what the spiritualists keep saying; and since we do, as a\nmatter of fact, have the 'compounded' idea, and do know _a_ and _b_\ntogether, they adopt a farther hypothesis to explain that fact. The\nseparate ideas exist, they say, but _affect_ a third entity, the soul.\n_This_ has the 'compounded' idea, if you please so to call it; and the\ncompounded idea is an altogether new psychic fact to which the separate\nideas stand in the relation, not of constituents, but of occasions of\nproduction.\nThis argument of the spiritualists against the associationists has\nnever been answered by the latter. It holds good against any talk\nabout self-compounding amongst feelings, against any 'blending,'\nor 'complication,' or 'mental chemistry,' or 'psychic synthesis,'\nwhich supposes a resultant consciousness to float off from the\nconstituents _per se_, in the absence of a supernumerary principle of\nconsciousness which they may affect. The mind-stuff theory, in short,\nis unintelligible. Atoms of feeling cannot compose higher feelings, any\nmore than atoms of matter can compose physical things! The 'things,'\nfor a clear-headed atomistic evolutionist, are not. Nothing is but\nthe everlasting atoms. When grouped in a certain way, _we_ name them\nthis 'thing' or that; but the thing we name has no existence out of\nour mind. So of the states of mind which are supposed to be compound\nbecause they know many different things together. Since indubitably\nsuch states do exist, they must exist as single new facts, effects,\npossibly, as the spiritualists say, on the Soul (we will not decide\nthat point here), but at any rate independent and integral, and not\ncompounded of psychic atoms.[176]\nCAN STATES OF MIND BE UNCONSCIOUS?\nThe passion for unity and smoothness is in some minds so insatiate\nthat, in spite of the logical clearness of these reasonings and\nconclusions, many will fail to be influenced by them. They establish\na sort of disjointedness in things which in certain quarters will\nappear intolerable. They sweep away all chance of 'passing without\nbreak' either from the material to the mental, or from the lower\nto the higher mental; and they thrust us back into a pluralism of\nconsciousnesses--each arising discontinuously in the midst of two\ndisconnected worlds, material and mental--which is even worse than the\nold notion of the separate creation of each particular soul. But the\nmalcontents will hardly try to refute our reasonings by direct attack.\nIt is more probable that, turning their back upon them altogether, they\nwill devote themselves to sapping and mining the region roundabout\nuntil it is a bog of logical liquefaction, into the midst of which all\ndefinite conclusions of any sort may be trusted ere long to sink and\ndisappear.\nOur reasonings have assumed that the 'integration' of a thousand\npsychic units must be either just the units over again, simply\nrebaptized, or else something real, but then other than and additional\nto those units; that if a certain existing fact is that of a thousand\nfeelings, it cannot at the same time be that of ONE feeling; for the\nessence of feeling is to be felt, and as a psychic existent _feels_,\nso it must _be_. If the one feeling feels like no one of the thousand,\nin what sense can it be said to _be_ the thousand? These assumptions\nare what the monists will seek to undermine. The Hegelizers amongst\nthem will take high ground at once, and say that the glory and\nbeauty of the psychic life is that in it all contradictions find\ntheir reconciliation; and that it is just because the facts we are\nconsidering _are_ facts of the self that they are both one and many at\nthe same time. With this intellectual temper I confess that I cannot\ncontend. As in striking at some unresisting gossamer with a club, one\nbut overreaches one's self, and the thing one aims at gets no harm. So\nI leave this school to its devices.\nThe other monists are of less deliquescent frame, and try to break\ndown distinctness among mental states by _making a distinction_. This\nsounds paradoxical, but it is only ingenious. The distinction is that\n_between the unconscious and the conscious being of the mental state_.\nIt is the sovereign means for believing what one likes in psychology,\nand of turning what might become a science into a tumbling-ground for\nwhimsies. It has numerous champions, and elaborate reasons to give for\nitself. We must therefore accord it due consideration. In discussing\nthe question:\nDO UNCONSCIOUS MENTAL STATES EXIST?\nit will be best to give the list of so-called proofs as briefly as\npossible, and to follow each by its objection, as in scholastic\nbooks.[177]\n_First Proof_. The _minimum visibile_, the _minimum audibile_, are\nobjects composed of parts. How can the whole affect the sense unless\neach part does? And yet each part does so without being separately\nsensible. Leibnitz calls the total consciousness an '_aperception_,'\nthe supposed insensible consciousness by the name of '_petites\nperceptions_.'\n\"To judge of the latter,\" he says, \"I am accustomed to use the example\nof the roaring of the sea with which one is assailed when near the\nshore. To hear this noise as one does, one must hear the parts which\ncompose its totality, that is, the noise of each wave,... although\nthis noise would not be noticed if its wave were alone. One must be\naffected a little by the movement of one wave, one must have some\nperception of each several noise, however small it be. Otherwise one\nwould not hear that of 100,000 waves, for of 100,000 zeros one can\nnever make a quantity.\"[178]\n_Reply_. This is an excellent example of the so-called 'fallacy of\ndivision,' or predicating what is true only of a collection, of each\nmember of the collection distributively. It no more follows that if a\nthousand things together cause sensation, one thing alone must cause\nit, than it follows that if one pound weight moves a balance, then one\nounce weight must move it too, in less degree. One ounce weight does\nnot move it _at all_; its movement _begins_ with the pound. At most we\ncan say that each ounce affects it in _some_ way which helps the advent\nof that movement. And so each infra-sensible stimulus to a nerve no\ndoubt affects the nerve and helps the birth of sensation when the other\nstimuli come. But this affection is a nerve-affection, and there is not\nthe slightest ground for supposing it to be a 'perception' unconscious\nof itself. \"A certain _quantity_ of the cause may be a necessary\ncondition to the production of _any_ of the effect,\"[179] when the\nlatter is a mental state.\n_Second Proof._ In all acquired dexterities and habits, secondarily\nautomatic performances as they are called, we do what _originally_\nrequired a chain of deliberately conscious perceptions and volitions.\nAs the actions still keep their intelligent character, intelligence\nmust still preside over their execution. But since our consciousness\nseems all the while elsewhere engaged, such intelligence must consist\nof unconscious perceptions, inferences, and volitions.\n_Reply._ There is more than one alternative explanation in accordance\nwith larger bodies of fact. One is that the perceptions and volitions\nin habitual actions may be performed consciously, only so quickly and\ninattentively that no _memory_ of them remains. Another is that the\nconsciousness of these actions exists, but is _split-off_ from the rest\nof the consciousness of the hemispheres. We shall find in Chapter X\nnumerous proofs of the reality of this split-off condition of portions\nof consciousness. Since in man the hemispheres indubitably co-operate\nin these secondarily automatic acts, it will not do to say either that\nthey occur without consciousness or that their consciousness is that\nof the lower centres, which we know nothing about. But either lack of\nmemory or split-off cortical consciousness will certainly account for\nall of the facts.[180]\n_Third Proof._ Thinking of A, we presently find ourselves thinking of\nC. Now B is the natural logical link between A and C, but we have no\nconsciousness of having thought of B. It must have been in our mind\n'_un_consciously,' and in that state affected the sequence of our\nideas.\n_Reply._ Here again we have a choice between more plausible\nexplanations. Either B was consciously there, but the next instant\nforgotten, or its _brain-tract_ alone was adequate to do the whole work\nof coupling A with C, without the idea B being aroused at all, whether\nconsciously or 'unconsciously.'\n_Fourth Proof._ Problems unsolved when we go to bed are found solved\nin the morning when we wake. Somnambulists do rational things. We\nawaken punctually at an hour predetermined overnight, etc. Unconscious\nthinking, volition, time-registration, etc., must have presided over\nthese acts.\n_Reply._ Consciousness forgotten, as in the hypnotic trance.\n_Fifth Proof._ Some patients will often, in an attack of epileptiform\nunconsciousness, go through complicated processes, such as eating a\ndinner in a restaurant and paying for it, or making a violent homicidal\nattack. In trance, artificial or pathological, long and complex\nperformances, involving the use of the reasoning powers, are executed,\nof which the patient is wholly unaware on coming to.\n_Reply._ Rapid and complete oblivescence is certainly the explanation\nhere. The analogue again is hypnotism. Tell the subject of an hypnotic\ntrance, during his trance, that he _will_ remember, and he may remember\neverything perfectly when he awakes, though without your telling him no\nmemory would have remained. The extremely rapid oblivescence of common\n_dreams_ is a familiar fact.\n_Sixth Proof._ In a musical concord the vibrations of the several notes\nare in relatively simple ratios. The mind must unconsciously count the\nvibrations, and be pleased by the simplicity which it finds.\n_Reply._ The brain-process produced by the simple ratios may be as\ndirectly agreeable as the conscious process of comparing them would be.\nNo counting, either conscious or 'unconscious,' is required.\n_Seventh Proof._ Every hour we make theoretic judgments and emotional\nreactions, and exhibit practical tendencies, for which we can give\nno explicit logical justification, but which are good inferences from\ncertain premises. We know more than we can say. Our conclusions run\nahead of our power to analyze their grounds. A child, ignorant of\nthe axiom that two things equal to the same are equal to each other,\napplies it nevertheless in his concrete judgments unerringly. A boor\nwill use the _dictum de omni et nullo_ who is unable to understand it\nin abstract terms.\n\"We seldom consciously think how our house is painted, what the shade\nof it is, what the pattern of our furniture is, or whether the door\nopens to the right or left, or out or in. But how quickly should we\nnotice a change in any of these things! Think of the door you have\nmost often opened, and tell, if you can, whether it opens to the\nright or left, out or in. Yet when you open the door you never put\nthe hand on the wrong side to find the latch, nor try to push it when\nit opens with a pull.... What is the precise characteristic in your\nfriend's step that enables you to recognize it when he is coming? Did\nyou ever consciously think the idea, 'if I run into a solid piece of\nmatter I shall get hurt, or be hindered in my progress'? and do you\navoid running into obstacles because you ever distinctly conceived, or\nconsciously acquired and thought, that idea?\"[181]\nMost of our knowledge is at all times potential. We act in accordance\nwith the whole drift of what we have learned, but few items rise into\nconsciousness at the time. Many of them, however, we may recall at\nwill. All this co-operation of unrealized principles and facts, of\npotential knowledge, with our actual thought is quite inexplicable\nunless we suppose the perpetual existence of an immense mass of _ideas\nin an unconscious state_, all of them exerting a steady pressure\nand influence upon our conscious thinking, and many of them in such\ncontinuity with it as ever and anon to become conscious themselves.\n_Reply._ No such mass of ideas is supposable. But there are all kinds\nof short-cuts in the brain; and processes not aroused strongly enough\nto give any 'idea' distinct enough to be a premise, may, nevertheless,\nhelp to determine just that resultant process of whose psychic\naccompaniment the said idea _would_ be a premise, if the idea existed\nat all. A certain overtone may be a feature of my friend's voice,\nand may conspire with the other tones thereof to arouse in my brain\nthe process which suggests to my consciousness his name. And yet I\nmay be ignorant of the overtone _per se_, and unable, even when he\nspeaks, to tell whether it be there or no. It leads me to the idea of\nthe name; but it produces in me no such cerebral process as that to\nwhich the _idea of the overtone_ would correspond. And similarly of\nour learning. Each subject we learn leaves behind it a modification\nof the brain, which makes it impossible for the latter to react upon\nthings just as it did before; and the result of the difference may\nbe a tendency to act, though with no idea, much as we should _if_ we\nwere consciously thinking about the subject. The becoming conscious\nof the latter at will is equally readily explained as a result of the\nbrain-modification. This, as Wundt phrases it, is a 'predisposition'\nto bring forth the conscious idea of the original subject, a\npredisposition which other stimuli and brain-processes may convert into\nan actual result. But such a predisposition is no 'unconscious idea;'\nit is only a particular collocation of the molecules in certain tracts\nof the brain.\n_Eighth Proof._ Instincts, as pursuits of ends by appropriate means,\nare manifestations of intelligence; but as the ends are not foreseen,\nthe intelligence must be unconscious.\n_Reply._ Chapter XXIV will show that all the phenomena of instinct are\nexplicable as actions of the nervous system, mechanically discharged by\nstimuli to the senses.\n_Ninth Proof._ In sense-perception we have results in abundance, which\ncan only be explained as conclusions drawn by a process of unconscious\ninference from data given to sense. A small human image on the retina\nis referred, not to a pygmy, but to a distant man of normal size. A\ncertain gray patch is inferred to be a white object seen in a dim\nlight. Often the inference leads us astray: e.g., pale gray against\npale green looks red, because we take a wrong premise to argue from.\nWe think a green film is spread over everything; and knowing that\nunder such a film a red thing would look gray, we wrongly infer\nfrom the gray appearance that a red thing must be there. Our study\nof space-perception in Chapter XVIII will give abundant additional\nexamples both of the truthful and illusory percepts which have been\nexplained to result from unconscious logic operations.\n_Reply._ That chapter will also in many cases refute this explanation.\nColor-and light-contrast are certainly purely sensational affairs, in\nwhich inference plays no part. This has been satisfactorily proved by\nHering,[182] and shall be treated of again in Chapter XVII. Our rapid\njudgments of size, shape, distance, and the like, are best explained\nas processes of simple cerebral association. Certain sense-impressions\ndirectly stimulate brain-tracts, of whose activity ready-made conscious\npercepts are the immediate psychic counterparts. They do this by a\nmechanism either connate or acquired by habit. It is to be remarked\nthat Wundt and Helmholtz, who in their earlier writings did more than\nany one to give vogue to the notion that unconscious inference is a\nvital factor in sense-perception, have seen fit on later occasions to\nmodify their views and to admit that results _like_ those of reasoning\nmay accrue without any actual reasoning process unconsciously taking\nplace.[183] Maybe the excessive and riotous applications made by\nHartmann of their principle have led them to this change. It would be\nnatural to feel towards him as the sailor in the story felt towards the\nhorse who got his foot into the stirrup,--\"If you're going to get on, I\nmust get off.\"\nHartmann fairly boxes the compass of the universe with the principle of\nunconscious thought. For him there is no namable thing that does not\nexemplify it. But his logic is so lax and his failure to consider the\nmost obvious alternatives so complete that it would, on the whole, be\na waste of time to look at his arguments in detail. The same is true\nof Schopenhauer, in whom the mythology reaches its climax. The visual\nperception, for example, of an object in space results, according\nto him, from the intellect performing the following operations, all\nunconscious. First, it apprehends the inverted retinal image and\nturns it right side up, constructing _flat space_ as a preliminary\noperation; then it computes from the angle of convergence of the\neyeballs that the two retinal images must be the projection of but a\nsingle _object_; thirdly, it constructs the third dimension and sees\nthis object _solid_; fourthly, it assigns its _distance_; and fifthly,\nin each and all of these operations it gets the objective character of\nwhat it 'constructs' by unconsciously inferring it as the only possible\n_cause_ of some sensation which it unconsciously feels.[184] Comment on\nthis seems hardly called for. It is, as I said, pure mythology.\nNone of these facts, then, appealed to so confidently in proof of the\nexistence of ideas in an unconscious state, prove anything of the sort.\nThey prove either that conscious ideas were present which the next\ninstant were forgotten; or they prove that certain results, _similar_\nto results of reasoning, may be wrought out by rapid brain-processes to\nwhich no ideation seems attached. But there is one more argument to be\nalleged, less obviously insufficient than those which we have reviewed,\nand demanding a new sort of reply.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Tenth Proof._ There is a great class of experiences in our mental life\nwhich may be described as discoveries that a subjective condition which\nwe have been having is really something different from what we had\nsupposed. We suddenly find ourselves bored by a thing which we thought\nwe were enjoying well enough; or in love with a person whom we imagined\nwe only liked. Or else we deliberately analyze our motives, and find\nthat at bottom they contain jealousies and cupidities which we little\nsuspected to be there. Our feelings towards people are perfect wells of\nmotivation, unconscious of itself, which introspection brings to light.\nAnd our sensations likewise: we constantly discover new elements in\nsensations which we have been in the habit of receiving all our days,\nelements, too, which have been there from the first, since otherwise\nwe should have been unable to distinguish the sensations containing\nthem from others nearly allied. The elements must exist, for we use\nthem to discriminate by; but they must exist in an unconscious state,\nsince we so completely fail to single them out.[185] The books of the\nanalytic school of psychology abound in examples of the kind. Who knows\nthe countless associations that mingle with his each and every thought?\nWho can pick apart all the nameless feelings that stream in at every\nmoment from his various internal organs, muscles, heart, glands, lungs,\netc., and compose in their totality his sense of bodily life? Who is\naware of the part played by feelings of innervation and suggestions of\npossible muscular exertion in all his judgments of distance, shape, and\nsize? Consider, too, the difference between a sensation which we simply\n_have_ and one which we _attend to_. Attention gives results that seem\nlike fresh creations; and yet the feelings and elements of feeling\nwhich it reveals must have been already there--in an unconscious\nstate. We all know _practically_ the difference between the so-called\nsonant and the so-called surd consonants, between D, B, Z, G, V, and\nT, P, S, K, F, respectively. But comparatively few persons know the\ndifference _theoretically_, until their attention has been called to\nwhat it is, when they perceive it readily enough. The sonants are\nnothing but the surds plus a certain element, which is alike in all,\nsuperadded. That element is the laryngeal sound with which they are\nuttered, surds having no such accompaniment. When we hear the sonant\nletter, both its component elements must really be in our mind; but\nwe remain unconscious of what they really are, and mistake the letter\nfor a simple quality of sound until an effort of attention teaches us\nits two components. There exist a host of sensations which most men\npass through life and never attend to, and consequently have only in\nan unconscious way. The feelings of opening and closing the glottis,\nof making tense the tympanic membrane, of accommodating for near\nvision, of intercepting the passage from the nostrils to the throat,\nare instances of what I mean. Every one gets these feelings many times\nan hour; but few readers, probably, are conscious of exactly what\nsensations are meant by the names I have just used. All these facts,\nand an enormous number more, seem to prove conclusively that, in\naddition to the fully conscious way in which an idea may exist in the\nmind, there is also an unconscious way; that it is unquestionably the\nsame identical idea which exists in these two ways; and that therefore\nany arguments against the mind-stuff theory, based on the notion\nthat _esse_ in our mental life is _sentiri_, and that an idea must\nconsciously be felt as what it is, fall to the ground.\n_Objection._ These reasonings are one tissue of confusion. Two states\nof mind which refer to the same external reality, or two states of\nmind the later one of which refers to the earlier, are described\nas the same state of mind, or 'idea,' published as it were in two\neditions; and then whatever qualities of the second edition are found\nopenly lacking in the first are explained as having really been there,\nonly in an 'unconscious' way. It would be difficult to believe that\nintelligent men could be guilty of so patent a fallacy, were not the\nhistory of psychology there to give the proof. The psychological\nstock-in-trade of some authors is the belief that two thoughts about\none thing are virtually the same thought, and that this same thought\nmay in subsequent reflections become more and more _conscious_ of what\nit really _was_ all along from the first. But once make the distinction\nbetween simply _having an idea_ at the moment of its presence and\nsubsequently knowing all sorts of things _about it_; make moreover that\nbetween a state of mind itself, taken as a subjective fact, on the one\nhand, and the objective thing it knows, on the other, and one has no\ndifficulty in escaping from the labyrinth.\nTake the latter distinction first: Immediately all the arguments based\non sensations and the new features in them which attention brings to\nlight fall to the ground. The sensations of the B and the V when we\nattend to these sounds and analyze out the laryngeal contribution\nwhich makes them differ from P and F respectively, are _different\nsensations_ from those of the B and the V taken in a simple way.\nThey stand, it is true, for the _same letters_, and thus mean the\n_same outer realities_; but they are different mental affections, and\ncertainly depend on widely different processes of cerebral activity.\nIt is unbelievable that two mental states so different as the passive\nreception of a sound as a whole, and the analysis of that whole into\ndistinct ingredients by voluntary attention, should be due to processes\nat all similar. And the subjective difference does not consist in that\nthe first-named state _is_ the second in an 'unconscious' form. It is\nan absolute psychic difference, even greater than that between the\nstates to which two different surds will give rise. The same is true\nof the other sensations chosen as examples. The man who learns for the\nfirst time how the closure of his glottis feels, experiences in this\ndiscovery an absolutely new psychic modification, the like of which he\nnever had before. He had another feeling before, a feeling incessantly\nrenewed, and of which the same glottis was the organic starting point;\nbut that was not the later feeling in an 'unconscious' state; it was\na feeling _sui generis_ altogether, although it took cognizance of\nthe same bodily part, the glottis. We shall see, hereafter, that the\nsame reality can be cognized by an endless number of psychic states,\nwhich may differ _toto c\u0153lo_ among themselves, without ceasing on\nthat account to refer to the reality in question. Each of them is a\nconscious fact: none of them has any mode of being whatever except a\ncertain way of being felt at the moment of being present. It is simply\nunintelligible and fantastical to say, because they point to the same\nouter reality, that they must therefore be so many editions of the same\n'idea,' now in a conscious and now in an 'unconscious' phase. There is\nonly one 'phase' in which an idea can be, and that is a fully conscious\ncondition. If it is not in that condition, then it is not at all.\nSomething else is, in its place. The something else may be a merely\nphysical brain-process, or it may be another conscious idea. Either of\nthese things may perform much the same _function_ as the first idea,\nrefer to the same object, and roughly stand in the same relations to\nthe upshot of our thought. But that is no reason why we should throw\naway the logical principle of identity in psychology, and say that,\nhowever it may fare in the outer world, the mind at any rate is a place\nin which a thing can be all kinds of other things without ceasing to be\nitself as well.\nNow take the other cases alleged, and the other distinction, that\nnamely between _having_ a mental state and knowing all _about_ it.\nThe truth is here even simpler to unravel. When I decide that I have,\nwithout knowing it, been for several weeks in love, I am simply giving\na name to a state which previously _I have not named_, but which was\nfully conscious; which had no residual mode of being except the manner\nin which it was conscious; and which, though it was a feeling towards\nthe same person for whom I now have a much more inflamed feeling, and\nthough it continuously led into the latter, and is similar enough to be\ncalled by the same name, is yet in no sense identical with the latter,\nand least of all in an 'unconscious' way. Again, the feelings from our\nviscera and other dimly-felt organs, the feelings of innervation (if\nsuch there be), and those of muscular exertion which, in our spatial\njudgments, are supposed unconsciously to determine what we shall\nperceive, are just exactly what we feel them, perfectly determinate\nconscious states, not vague editions of other conscious states. They\nmay be faint and weak; they may be very vague cognizers of the same\nrealities which other conscious states cognize and name exactly; they\nmay be unconscious of much in the reality which the other states are\nconscious of. But that does not make them _in themselves_ a whit dim\nor vague or unconscious. They _are_ eternally as they feel when they\nexist, and can, neither actually nor potentially, be identified with\nanything else than their own faint selves. A faint feeling may be\nlooked back upon and classified and understood in its relations to what\nwent before or after it in the stream of thought. But it, on the one\nhand, and the later state of mind which knows all these things about\nit, on the other, are surely not two conditions, one conscious and the\nother 'unconscious,' of the same identical psychic fact. It is the\ndestiny of thought that, on the whole, our early ideas are superseded\nby later ones, giving fuller accounts of the same realities. But none\nthe less do the earlier and the later ideas preserve their own several\nsubstantive identities as so many several successive states of mind.\nTo believe the contrary would make any definite science of psychology\nimpossible. The only identity to be found among our successive ideas is\ntheir similarity of cognitive or representative function as dealing\nwith the same objects. Identity of _being_, there is none; and I\nbelieve that throughout the rest of this volume the reader will reap\nthe advantages of the simpler way of formulating the facts which is\nhere begun.[186]\n*       *       *       *       *\nSo we seem not only to have ascertained the unintelligibility of the\nnotion that a mental fact can be two things at once, and that what\nseems like one feeling, of blueness for example, or of hatred, may\nreally and 'unconsciously' be ten thousand elementary feelings which\ndo not resemble blueness or hatred at all, but we find that we can\nexpress all the observed facts in other ways. The mind-stuff theory,\nhowever, though scotched, is, we may be sure, not killed. If we ascribe\nconsciousness to unicellular animalcules, then single cells can have\nit, and analogy should make us ascribe it to the several cells of the\nbrain, each individually taken. And what a convenience would it not\nbe for the psychologist if, by the adding together of various doses\nof this separate-cell-consciousness, he could treat thought as a kind\nof stuff or material, to be measured out in great or small amount,\nincreased and subtracted from, and baled about at will! He feels an\nimperious craving to be allowed to _construct_ synthetically the\nsuccessive mental states which he describes. The mind-stuff theory so\neasily admits of the construction being made, that it seems certain\nthat 'man's unconquerable mind' will devote much future pertinacity and\ningenuity to setting it on its legs again and getting it into some sort\nof plausible working-order. I will therefore conclude the chapter with\nsome consideration of the remaining difficulties which beset the matter\nas it at present stands.\nDIFFICULTY OF STATING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MIND AND BRAIN.\nIt will be remembered that in our criticism of the theory of the\nintegration of successive conscious units into a feeling of musical\npitch, we decided that whatever integration there was was that of the\nair-pulses into a simpler and simpler sort of physical effect, as the\npropagations of material change got higher and higher in the nervous\nsystem. At last, we said (p. 23), there results some simple and massive\nprocess in the auditory centres of the hemispherical cortex, to which,\n_as a whole_, the feeling of musical pitch directly corresponds.\nAlready, in discussing the localization of functions in the brain,\nI had said (pp. 158-9) that consciousness accompanies the stream of\ninnervation through that organ and varies in quality with the character\nof the currents, being mainly of things seen if the occipital lobes\nare much involved, of things heard if the action is focalized in the\ntemporal lobes, etc., etc.; and I had added that a vague formula like\nthis was as much as one could safely venture on in the actual state of\nphysiology. The facts of mental deafness and blindness, of auditory\nand optical aphasia, show us that the whole brain must act together\nif certain thoughts are to occur. The consciousness, which is itself\nan integral thing not made of parts, 'corresponds' to the entire\nactivity of the brain, whatever that may be, at the moment. This is a\nway of expressing the relation of mind and brain from which I shall\nnot depart during the remainder of the book, because it expresses the\nbare phenomenal fact with no hypothesis, and is exposed to no such\nlogical objections as we have found to cling to the theory of ideas in\ncombination.\nNevertheless, this formula which is so unobjectionable if taken\nvaguely, positivistically, or scientifically, as a mere empirical law\nof concomitance between our thoughts and our brain, tumbles to pieces\nentirely if we assume to represent anything more intimate or ultimate\nby it. The ultimate of ultimate problems, of course, in the study\nof the relations of thought and brain, is to understand why and how\nsuch disparate things are connected at all. But before that problem\nis solved (if it ever is solved) there is a less ultimate problem\nwhich must first be settled. Before the connection of thought and\nbrain can be explained, it must at least be _stated_ in an elementary\nform; and there are great difficulties about so stating it. To state\nit in elementary form one must reduce it to its lowest terms and\nknow which mental fact and which cerebral fact are, so to speak, in\nimmediate juxtaposition. We must find the minimal mental fact whose\nbeing reposes directly on a brain-fact; and we must similarly find\nthe minimal brain-event which will have a mental counterpart at all.\nBetween the mental and the physical minima thus found there will be an\nimmediate relation, the expression of which, if we had it, would be the\nelementary psycho-physic law.\nOur own formula escapes the unintelligibility of psychic atoms by\n_taking the entire thought_ (even of a complex object) _as the minimum\nwith which it deals on the mental side_. But in taking the entire\nbrain-process as its minimal fact on the material side it confronts\nother difficulties almost as bad.\nIn the first place, it ignores analogies on which certain critics\nwill insist, those, namely, between the composition of the total\nbrain-process and that of the _object_ of the thought. The total\nbrain-process is composed of parts, of simultaneous processes in the\nseeing, the hearing, the feeling, and other centres. The object thought\nof is also composed of parts, some of which are seen, others heard,\nothers perceived by touch and muscular manipulation. \"How then,\"\nthese critics will say, \"should the thought not itself be composed of\nparts, each the counterpart of a part of the object and of a part of\nthe brain-process?\" So natural is this way of looking at the matter\nthat it has given rise to what is on the whole the most flourishing of\nall psychological systems--that of the Lockian school of associated\nideas--of which school the mind-stuff theory is nothing but the last\nand subtlest offshoot.\nThe second difficulty is deeper still. _The 'entire brain-process' is\nnot a physical fact at all._ It is the appearance to an onlooking mind\nof a multitude of physical facts. 'Entire brain' is nothing but our\nname for the way in which a million of molecules arranged in certain\npositions may affect our sense. On the principles of the corpuscular or\nmechanical philosophy, the only realities are the separate molecules,\nor at most the cells. Their aggregation into a 'brain' is a fiction of\npopular speech. Such a fiction cannot serve as the objectively real\ncounterpart to any psychic state whatever. Only a genuinely physical\nfact can so serve. But the molecular fact is the only genuine physical\nfact--whereupon we seem, if we are to have an elementary psycho-physic\nlaw at all, thrust right back upon something like the mind-stuff\ntheory, for the molecular fact, being an element of the 'brain,'\nwould seem naturally to correspond, not to the total thoughts, but to\nelements in the thought.\nWhat shall we do? Many would find relief at this point in celebrating\nthe mystery of the Unknowable and the 'awe' which we should feel at\nhaving such a principle to take final charge of our perplexities.\nOthers would rejoice that the finite and separatist view of things\nwith which we started had at last developed its contradictions, and\nwas about to lead us dialectically upwards to some 'higher synthesis'\nin which inconsistencies cease from troubling and logic is at rest.\nIt may be a constitutional infirmity, but I can take no comfort in\nsuch devices for making a luxury of intellectual defeat. They are but\nspiritual chloroform. Better live on the ragged edge, better gnaw the\nfile forever!\nTHE MATERIAL-MONAD THEORY.\nThe most rational thing to do is to suspect that there may be a third\npossibility, an alternative supposition which we have not considered.\nNow there _is_ an alternative supposition--a supposition moreover\nwhich has been frequently made in the history of philosophy, and which\nis freer from logical objections than either of the views we have\nourselves discussed. It may be called the _theory of polyzoism or\nmultiple monadism_; and it conceives the matter thus:\nEvery brain-cell has its own individual consciousness, which no other\ncell knows anything about, all individual consciousnesses being\n'ejective' to each other. There is, however, among the cells one\ncentral or pontifical one to which _our_ consciousness is attached. But\nthe events of all the other cells physically influence this arch-cell;\nand through producing their joint effects on it, these other cells may\nbe said to 'combine.' The arch-cell is, in fact, one of those 'external\nmedia' without which we saw that no fusion or integration of a number\nof things can occur. The physical modifications of the arch-cell thus\nform a sequence of results in the production whereof every other cell\nhas a share, so that, as one might say, every other cell is represented\ntherein. And similarly, the conscious correlates to these physical\nmodifications form a sequence of thoughts or feelings, each one of\nwhich is, as to its substantive being, an integral and uncompounded\npsychic thing, but each one of which may (in the exercise of its\n_cognitive_ function) be _aware of THINGS_ many and complicated in\nproportion to the number of other cells that have helped to modify the\ncentral cell.\nBy a conception of this sort, one incurs neither of the internal\ncontradictions which we found to beset the other two theories. One has\nno unintelligible self-combining of psychic units to account for on the\none hand; and on the other hand, one need not treat as the physical\ncounterpart of the stream of consciousness under observation, a 'total\nbrain-activity' which is non-existent as a genuinely physical fact.\nBut, to offset these advantages, one has physiological difficulties\nand improbabilities. There is no cell or group of cells in the brain\nof such anatomical or functional pre-eminence as to appear to be the\nkeystone or centre of gravity of the whole system. And even if there\nwere such a cell, the theory of multiple monadism would, in strictness\nof thought, have no right to stop at it and treat it as a unit. The\ncell is no more a unit, materially considered, than the total brain\nis a unit. It is a compound of molecules, just as the brain is a\ncompound of cells and fibres. And the molecules, according to the\nprevalent physical theories, are in turn compounds of atoms. The\ntheory in question, therefore, if radically carried out, must set up\nfor its elementary and irreducible psycho-physic couple, not the cell\nand its consciousness, but the primordial and eternal atom and its\nconsciousness. We are back at Leibnitzian monadism, and therewith leave\nphysiology behind us and dive into regions inaccessible to experience\nand verification; and our doctrine, although not self-contradictory,\nbecomes so remote and unreal as to be almost as bad as if it were.\nSpeculative minds alone will take an interest in it; and metaphysics,\nnot psychology, will be responsible for its career. That the career may\nbe a successful one must be admitted as a possibility--a theory which\nLeibnitz, Herbart, and Lotze have taken under their protection must\nhave some sort of a destiny.\nTHE SOUL-THEORY.\nBut is this my last word? By no means. Many readers have certainly been\nsaying to themselves for the last few pages: \"Why on earth doesn't\nthe poor man say _the Soul_ and have done with it?\" Other readers, of\nanti-spiritualistic training and prepossessions, advanced thinkers,\nor popular evolutionists, will perhaps be a little surprised to\nfind this much-despised word now sprung upon them at the end of so\nphysiological a train of thought. But the plain fact is that all the\narguments for a 'pontifical cell' or an 'arch-monad' are also arguments\nfor that well-known spiritual agent in which scholastic psychology\nand common-sense have always believed. And my only reason for beating\nthe bushes so, and not bringing it in earlier as a possible solution\nof our difficulties, has been that by this procedure I might perhaps\nforce some of these materialistic minds to feel the more strongly the\nlogical respectability of the spiritualistic position. The fact is that\none cannot afford to despise any of these great traditional objects of\nbelief. Whether we realize it or not, there is always a great drift\nof reasons, positive and negative, towing us in their direction. If\nthere be such entities as Souls in the universe, they may possibly be\naffected by the manifold occurrences that go on in the nervous centres.\nTo the state of the entire brain at a given moment they may respond\nby inward modifications of their own. These changes of state may be\npulses of consciousness, cognitive of objects few or many, simple or\ncomplex. The soul would be thus a medium upon which (to use our earlier\nphraseology) the manifold brain-processes _combine their effects_.\nNot needing to consider it as the 'inner aspect' of any arch-molecule\nor brain-cell, we escape that physiological improbability; and as its\npulses of consciousness are unitary and integral affairs from the\noutset, we escape the absurdity of supposing feelings which exist\nseparately and then 'fuse together' by themselves. The separateness is\nin the brain-world, on this theory, and the unity in the soul-world;\nand the only trouble that remains to haunt us is the metaphysical one\nof understanding how one sort of world or existent thing can affect or\ninfluence another at all. This trouble, however, since it also exists\ninside of both worlds, and involves neither physical improbability nor\nlogical contradiction, is relatively small.\nI confess, therefore, that to posit a soul influenced in some\nmysterious way by the brain-states and responding to them by conscious\naffections of its own, seems to me the line of least logical\nresistance, so far as we yet have attained.\nIf it does not strictly _explain_ anything, it is at any rate less\npositively objectionable than either mind-stuff or a material-monad\ncreed. _The bare_ PHENOMENON, _however, the_ IMMEDIATELY KNOWN _thing\nwhich on the mental side is in apposition with the entire brain-process\nis the state of consciousness and not the soul itself._ Many of the\nstanchest believers in the soul admit that we know it only as an\ninference from experiencing its _states_. In Chapter X, accordingly,\nwe must return to its consideration again, and _ask ourselves whether,\nafter all, the ascertainment of a blank unmediated correspondence,\nterm for term, of the succession of states of consciousness with the\nsuccession of total brain-processes, be not the simplest psycho-physic\nformula, and the last word of a psychology which contents itself with\nverifiable laws, and seeks only to be clear, and to avoid unsafe\nhypotheses._ Such a mere admission of the empirical parallelism will\nthere appear the wisest course. By keeping to it, our psychology\nwill remain positivistic and non-metaphysical; and although this is\ncertainly only a provisional halting-place, and things must some day\nbe more thoroughly thought out, we shall abide there in this book, and\njust as we have rejected mind-dust, we shall take no account of the\nsoul. The spiritualistic reader may nevertheless believe in the soul\nif he will; whilst the positivistic one who wishes to give a tinge of\nmystery to the expression of his positivism can continue to say that\nnature in her unfathomable designs has mixed us of clay and flame,\nof brain and mind, that the two things hang indubitably together and\ndetermine each other's being, but how or why, no mortal may ever know.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[160] Psychol. \u00a7 62.\n[161] _Ibid._ \u00a7 272.\n[162] Fragments of Science, 5th ed., p. 420.\n[163] Belfast Address, 'Nature,' August 20, 1874, p. 318. I cannot\nhelp remarking that the disparity between motions and feelings on\nwhich these authors lay so much stress, is somewhat less absolute\nthan at first sight it seems. There are categories common to the two\nworlds. Not only temporal succession (as Helmholtz admits, Physiol.\nOptik, p. 445), but such attributes as intensity, volume, simplicity\nor complication, smooth or impeded change, rest or agitation, are\nhabitually predicated of both physical facts and mental facts. Where\nsuch analogies obtain, the things do have something in common.\n[164] Psychology, \u00a7 131\n[165] 'Nature,' as above, 317-8.\n[166] 'Nascent' is Mr. Spencer's great word. In showing how at a\ncertain point consciousness must appear upon the evolving scene this\nauthor fairly outdoes himself in vagueness.\n\"In its higher forms, Instinct is probably accompanied by a rudimentary\nconsciousness. There cannot be co-ordination of many stimuli without\nsome ganglion through which they are all brought into relation. In\nthe process of bringing them into relation, this ganglion must be\nsubject to the influence of each--must undergo many changes. And\nthe quick succession of changes in a ganglion, implying as it does\nperpetual experiences of differences and likenesses, constitutes the\n_raw material_ of consciousness. The _implication_ is that as fast as\nInstinct is developed, some kind of consciousness becomes nascent.\"\n(Psychology, \u00a7 195.)\nThe words 'raw material' and 'implication' which I have italicized\nare the words which do the _evolving_. They are supposed to have\nall the rigor which the 'synthetic philosophy' requires. In the\nfollowing passage, when 'impressions' pass through a common 'centre\nof communication' in succession (much as people might pass into a\ntheatre through a turnstile) consciousness, non-existent until then, is\nsupposed to result:\n\"Separate impressions are received by the senses--by different parts\nof the body. If they go no further than the places at which they\nare received, they are useless. Or if only some of them are brought\ninto relation with one another, they are useless. That an effectual\nadjustment may be made, they must be all brought into relation with one\nanother. But this implies some centre of communication common to them\nall, through which they severally pass; and as they cannot pass through\nit simultaneously, they must pass through it in succession. So that as\nthe external phenomena responded to become greater in number and more\ncomplicated in kind, the variety and rapidity of the changes to which\nthis common centre of communication is subject must increase--there\nmust result an unbroken series of these changes-_there must arise a\nconsciousness_.\n\"Hence the progress of the correspondence between the organism and its\nenvironment necessitates a gradual reduction of the sensorial changes\nto a succession; and by so doing _evolves a distinct consciousness_--a\nconsciousness that becomes higher as the succession becomes more rapid\nand the correspondence more complete.\" (_Ibid._ \u00a7 179.)\nIt is true that in the Fortnightly Review (vol. xiv, p. 716) Mr.\nSpencer denies that he means by this passage to tell us anything about\nthe origin of consciousness at all. It resembles, however, too many\nother places in his Psychology (e.g. \u00a7\u00a7 43, 110, 244) not to be taken\nas a serious attempt to explain how consciousness must at a certain\npoint be 'evolved.' That, when a critic calls his attention to the\ninanity of his words, Mr. Spencer should say he never meant anything\nparticular by them, is simply an example of the scandalous vagueness\nwith which this sort of 'chromo-philosophy' is carried on.\n[167] His own words are: \"Mistakes are made in the sense that he\nadmits having been touched, when in reality it was radiant heat that\naffected his skin. In our own before-mentioned experiments there\nwas never any deception on the entire palmar side of the hand or\non the face. On the back of the hand in one case in a series of 60\nstimulations 4 mistakes occurred, in another case 2 mistakes in 45\nstimulations. On the extensor side of the upper arm 3 deceptions out of\n48 stimulations were noticed, and in the case of another individual,\n1 out of 31. In one case over the spine 3 deceptions in a series of\n11 excitations were observed; in another, 4 out of 19. On the lumbar\nspine 6 deceptions came among 29 stimulations, and again 4 out of\n7. There is certainly not yet enough material on which to rest a\ncalculation of probabilities, but any one can easily convince himself\nthat on the back there is no question of even a moderately accurate\ndiscrimination between warmth and a light pressure so far as but small\nportions of skin come into play. It has been as yet impossible to make\ncorresponding experiments with regard to sensibility to cold.\" (Lehrb.\nd. Anat. u. Physiol. d. Sinnesorgane (1862), p. 29.)\n[168] Principles of Psychology, \u00a7 60.\n[169] Oddly enough, Mr. Spencer seems quite unaware of the\n_general_ function of the theory of elementary units of mind-stuff\nin the evolutionary philosophy. We have seen it to be absolutely\nindispensable, if that philosophy is to work, to postulate\nconsciousness in the nebula,---the simplest way being, of course, to\nsuppose every atom animated. Mr. Spencer, however, will have it (e.g.\nFirst Principles, \u00a7 71) that consciousness is only the occasional\nresult of the 'transformation' of a certain amount of 'physical force'\nto which it is 'equivalent.' Presumably a brain must already be there\nbefore any such 'transformation' can take place; and so the argument\nquoted in the text stands as a mere local detail, without general\nbearings.\n[170] The compounding of colors may be dealt with in an identical\nway. Helmholtz has shown that if green light and red light fall\nsimultaneously on the retina, we see the color yellow. The mind-stuff\ntheory would interpret this as a ease where the feeling green and the\nfeeling red 'combine' into the _tertium quid_ of feeling, yellow. What\nreally occurs is no doubt that a third kind of nerve-process is set\nup when the combined lights impinge on the retina,--not simply the\nprocess of red plus the process of green, but something quite different\nfrom both or either. Of course, then, there _are_ no feelings, either\nof red or of green, present to the mind at all; but the feeling of\nyellow which _is_ there, answers as directly to the nerve-process which\nmomentarily then exists, as the feelings of green and red would answer\nto their respective nerve-processes did the latter happen to be taking\nplace.\n[171] Cf. Mill's Logic, book vi, chap. iv, \u00a7 3.\n[172] I find in my students an almost invincible tendency to think that\nwe can immediately perceive that feelings do combine. \"What!\" they say,\n\"is not the taste of lemonade composed of that of lemon _plus_ that of\nsugar?\" This is taking the combining of objects for that of feelings.\nThe physical lemonade contains both the lemon and the sugar, but its\ntaste does not contain their tastes, for if there are any two things\nwhich are certainly _not_ present in the taste of lemonade, those are\nthe lemon-sour on the one hand and the sugar-sweet on the other. These\ntastes are absent utterly. The entirely new taste which is present\n_resembles_, it is true, both those tastes; but in Chapter XIII we\nshall see that resemblance can not always be held to involve partial\nidentity.\n[173] E. Montgomery, in 'Mind,' v, 18-19. See also pp. 24-5.\n[174] J. Royce, 'Mind,' vi, p. 376. Lotze has set forth the truth\nof this law more clearly and copiously than any other writer.\nUnfortunately he is too lengthy to quote.

Riehl: Der\nphilosophische Kriticismus, Bd. ii, Theil 2, 2ter Abschnitt, 2tes Cap.\n(1887). The clearest of all these Statements is, as far as it goes,\nthat of Prince.\n[175] \"Someone might say that although it is true that neither a blind\nman nor a deaf man by himself can compare sounds with colors, yet since\none hears and the other sees they might do so both together.... But\nwhether they are apart or close together makes no difference; not even\nif they permanently keep house together; no, not if they were Siamese\ntwins, or more than Siamese twins, and were inseparably grown together,\nwould it make the assumption any more possible. Only when sound and\ncolor are represented in the same reality is it thinkable that they\nshould be compared.\" (Brentano: Psychologie, p. 209.)\n[176] The reader must observe that we are reasoning altogether about\nthe _Logic_ of the mind-stuff theory, about whether it can _exist in\nthe constitution_ of higher mental states by viewing them as _identical\nwith lower ones_ summed together. We say the two sorts of fact are\nnot identical: a higher state _is_ not a lot of lower states; it is\nitself. When, however, a lot of lower states have come together, or\nwhen certain brain-conditions occur together which, _if they occurred\nseparately, would produce_ a lot of lower states, we have not for a\nmoment pretended that a higher state may not emerge. In fact it does\nemerge under those conditions; and our Chapter IX will be mainly\ndevoted to the proof of this fact. But such emergence is that of a new\npsychic entity, and is _toto c\u0153lo_ different from such an 'integration'\nof the lower states as the mind-stuff theory affirms.\nIt may seem strange to suppose that anyone should mistake criticism\nof a certain theory about a fact for doubt of the fact itself. And\nyet the confusion is made in high quarters enough to justify our\nremarks. Mr. J. Ward, in his article Psychology in the Encyclop\u00e6dia\nBritannica, speaking of the hypothesis that \"a series of feelings can\nbe aware of itself as a series,\" says (p. 39): \"Paradox is too mild\na word for it, even contradiction will hardly suffice.\" Whereupon,\nProfessor Bain takes him thus to task: \"As to 'a series of states being\naware of itself,' I confess I see no insurmountable difficulty. It\nmay be a fact, or not a fact; it may be a very clumsy expression for\nwhat it is applied to; but it is neither paradox nor contradiction.\nA series merely contradicts an individual, or it may be two or more\nindividuals as coexisting; but that is too general to exclude the\npossibility of self-knowledge. It certainly does not bring the property\nof self-knowledge into the foreground, which, however, is not the same\nas denying it. An algebraic series might know itself, without any\ncontradiction: the only thing against it is the want of evidence of the\nfact.\" ('Mind,' xi, 459). Prof. Bain thinks, then, that all the bother\nis about the difficulty of seeing how a series of feelings can have the\nknowledge of itself _added to it!!!_ As if anybody ever was troubled\nabout that. That, notoriously enough, is a fact: our consciousness\nis a series of feelings to which every now and then is _added_ a\nretrospective consciousness that they have come and gone. What Mr. Ward\nand I are troubled about is merely the silliness of the mind-stuffists\nand associationists continuing to say that the 'series of states' _is_\nthe 'awareness of itself;' that if the states be posited severally,\ntheir collective consciousness is _eo ipso_ given; and that we need no\nfarther explanation, or 'evidence of the fact.'\n[177] The writers about 'unconscious cerebration' seem sometimes to\nmean that and sometimes unconscious thought. The arguments which follow\nare culled from various quarters. The reader will find them most\nsystematically urged by E. von Hartmann: Philosophy of the Unconscious,\nvol. i; and by E. Colsenet: La Vie Inconsciente de l'Esprit (1880).\nConsult also T. Laycock: Mind and Brain, vol. i, chap. v (1860); W.\nB. Carpenter: Mental Physiology, chap. xiii; F. P.

In Chapter III of that book\nthe notion of unconscious thought is subjected to the clearest and\nmost searching criticism which it has yet received. Some passages are\nso similar to what I have myself written that I must quote them in a\nnote. After proving that dimness and clearness, incompleteness and\ncompleteness do not pertain to a state of mind _as such_--since every\nstate of mind must be _exactly_ what it is, and nothing else--but only\npertain to the way in which states of mind stand for objects, which\nthey more or less dimly, more or less clearly, _represent_; Lipps takes\nthe case of those sensations which attention is said to make more\nclear. \"I perceive an object,\" he says, \"now in clear daylight, and\nagain at night. Call the content of the day-perception _a_, and that\nof the evening-perception _a^1_. There will probably be a considerable\ndifference between _a_ and _a^1_. The colors of _a_ will be varied\nand intense, and will be sharply bounded by each other; those of\n_a^1_ will be less luminous, and less strongly contrasted, and will\napproach a common gray or brown, and merge more into each other. Both\npercepts, however, as such, are completely determinate and distinct\nfrom all others. The colors of _a^1_ appear before my eye neither more\nnor less decidedly dark and blurred than the colors of _a_ appear\nbright and sharply bounded. But now I know, or believe I know, that\none and the same real Object A corresponds to both _a_ and _a^1_. I\nam convinced, moreover, that _a_ represents A better than does _a^1_.\nInstead, however, of giving to my conviction this, its only correct,\nexpression, and keeping the content of my consciousness and the real\nobject, the representation and what it means, distinct from each other,\nI substitute the real object for the content of the consciousness, and\ntalk of the experience as if it consisted in one and the same object\n(namely, the surreptitiously introduced real one), constituting twice\nover the content of my consciousness, once in a clear and distinct,\nthe other time in an obscure and vague fashion. I talk now of a\ndistincter and of a less distinct _consciousness_ of A, whereas I\nam only justified in talking of two consciousnesses, _a_ and _a^1_,\nequally distinct _in se_, but to which the supposed external object A\ncorresponds with different degrees of distinctness.\" (P. 38-9.)\nCHAPTER VII.\nTHE METHODS AND SNARES OF PSYCHOLOGY\nWe have now finished the physiological preliminaries of our subject\nand must in the remaining chapters study the mental states themselves\nwhose cerebral conditions and concomitants we have been considering\nhitherto. Beyond the brain, however, there is an outer world to which\nthe brain-states themselves 'correspond.' And it will be well, ere we\nadvance farther, to say a word about the relation of the mind to this\nlarger sphere of physical fact.\nPSYCHOLOGY IS A NATURAL SCIENCE.\nThat is, the mind which the psychologist studies is the mind of\ndistinct individuals inhabiting definite portions of a real space and\nof a real time. With any other sort of mind, absolute Intelligence,\nMind unattached to a particular body, or Mind not subject to the course\nof time, the psychologist as such has nothing to do. 'Mind,' in his\nmouth, is only a class name for _minds_. Fortunate will it be if his\nmore modest inquiry result in any generalizations which the philosopher\ndevoted to absolute Intelligence as such can use.\nTo the psychologist, then, the minds he studies are _objects_, in a\nworld of other objects. Even when he introspectively analyzes his own\nmind, and tells what he finds there, he talks about it in an objective\nway. He says, for instance, that under certain circumstances the color\ngray appears to him green, and calls the appearance an illusion.\nThis implies that he compares two objects, a real color seen under\ncertain conditions, and a mental perception which he believes to\nrepresent it, and that he declares the relation between them to be of\na certain kind. In making this critical judgment, the psychologist\nstands as much outside of the perception which he criticises as he\ndoes of the color. Both are his objects. And if this is true of him\nwhen he reflects on his own conscious states, how much truer is it\nwhen he treats of those of others! In German philosophy since Kant\nthe word _Erkenntnisstheorie_, criticism of the faculty of knowledge,\nplays a great part. Now the psychologist necessarily becomes such an\n_Erkenntnisstheoretiker_. But the knowledge he theorizes about is not\nthe bare function of knowledge which Kant criticises--he does not\ninquire into the possibility of knowledge _\u00fcberhaupt_. He assumes it to\nbe possible, he does not doubt its presence in himself at the moment\nhe speaks. The knowledge he criticises is the knowledge of particular\nmen about the particular things that surround them. This he may, upon\noccasion, in the light of his _own_ unquestioned knowledge, pronounce\ntrue or false, and trace the reasons by which it has become one or the\nother.\nIt is highly important that this natural-science point of view should\nbe understood at the outset. Otherwise more may be demanded of the\npsychologist than he ought to be expected to perform.\nA diagram will exhibit more emphatically what the assumptions of\nPsychology must be:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| 1            |  2           |   3             |   4                  |\n| The          |  The Thought |   The Thought's |   The Psychologist's |\n| Psychologist |  Studied     |   Object        |   Reality            |\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThese four squares contain the irreducible data of psychology. No. 1,\nthe psychologist, believes Nos. 2, 3, and 4, which together form _his\n_ total object, to be realities, and reports them and their mutual\nrelations as truly as he can without troubling himself with the puzzle\nof how he can report them at all. About such _ultimate _ puzzles he in\nthe main need trouble himself no more than the geometer, the chemist,\nor the botanist do, who make precisely the same assumptions as he.[187]\nOf certain fallacies to which the psychologist is exposed by reason of\nhis peculiar point of view--that of being a reporter of subjective as\nwell as of objective facts, we must presently speak. But not until we\nhave considered the methods he uses for ascertaining what the facts in\nquestion are.\nTHE METHODS OF INVESTIGATION.\n_Introspective Observation is what we have to rely on first and\nforemost and always._ The word introspection need hardly be defined--it\nmeans, of course, the looking into our own minds and reporting what\nwe there discover. _Every one agrees that we there discover states of\nconsciousness._ So far as I know, the existence of such states has\nnever been doubted by any critic, however sceptical in other respects\nhe may have been. That we have _cogitations_ of some sort is the\n_inconcussum_ in a world most of whose other facts have at some time\ntottered in the breath of philosophic doubt. All people unhesitatingly\nbelieve that they feel themselves thinking, and that they distinguish\nthe mental state as an inward activity or passion, from all the objects\nwith which it may cognitively deal. _I regard this belief as the most\nfundamental of all the postulates of Psychology,_ and shall discard all\ncurious inquiries about its certainty as too metaphysical for the scope\nof this book.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_A Question of Nomenclature._ We ought to have some general term\nby which to designate all states of consciousness merely as such,\nand apart from their particular quality or cognitive function.\nUnfortunately most of the terms in use have grave objections. 'Mental\nstate,' 'state of consciousness,' 'conscious modification,' are\ncumbrous and have no kindred verbs. The same is true of 'subjective\ncondition.' 'Feeling' has the verb 'to feel,' both active and neuter,\nand such derivatives as 'feelingly,' 'felt,' 'feltness,' etc., which\nmake it extremely convenient. But on the other hand it has specific\nmeanings as well as its generic one, sometimes standing for pleasure\nand pain, and being sometimes a synonym of '_sensation_' as opposed\nto _thought_; whereas we wish a term to cover sensation and thought\nindifferently. Moreover, 'feeling' has acquired in the hearts of\nplatonizing thinkers a very opprobrious set of implications; and since\none of the great obstacles to mutual understanding in philosophy is the\nuse of words eulogistically and disparagingly, impartial terms ought\nalways, if possible, to be preferred. The word _psychosis_ has been\nproposed by Mr. Huxley. It has the advantage of being correlative to\n_neurosis_ (the name applied by the same author to the corresponding\nnerve-process), and is moreover technical and devoid of partial\nimplications. But it has no verb or other grammatical form allied to\nit. The expressions 'affection of the soul,' 'modification of the\nego,' are clumsy, like 'state of consciousness,' and they implicitly\nassert theories which it is not well to embody in terminology before\nthey have been openly discussed and approved. 'Idea' is a good vague\nneutral word, and was by Locke employed in the broadest generic way;\nbut notwithstanding his authority it has not domesticated itself in the\nlanguage so as to cover bodily sensations, and it moreover has no verb.\n'Thought' would be by far the best word to use if it could be made to\ncover sensations. It has no opprobrious connotation such as 'feeling'\nhas, and it immediately suggests the omnipresence of cognition (or\nreference to an object other than the mental state itself), which\nwe shall soon see to be of the mental life's essence. But can the\nexpression 'thought of a toothache' ever suggest to the reader the\nactual present pain itself? It is hardly possible; and we thus seem\nabout to be forced back on some _pair_ of terms like Hume's 'impression\nand idea,' or Hamilton's 'presentation and representation,' or the\nordinary 'feeling and thought,' if we wish to cover the whole ground.\nIn this quandary we can make no definitive choice, but must, according\nto the convenience of the context, use sometimes one, sometimes another\nof the synonyms that have been mentioned. _My own partiality is for\neither FEELING or THOUGHT._ I shall probably often use both words in a\nwider sense than usual, and alternately startle two classes of readers\nby their unusual sound; but if the connection makes it clear that\nmental states at large, irrespective of their kind, are meant, this\nwill do no harm, and may even do some good.[188]\n*       *       *       *       *\n_The inaccuracy of introspective observation_ has been made a subject\nof debate. It is important to gain some fixed ideas on this point\nbefore we proceed.\nThe commonest spiritualistic opinion is that the Soul or _Subject_\nof the mental life is a metaphysical entity, inaccessible to direct\nknowledge, and that the various mental states and operations of which\nwe reflectively become aware are objects of an inner sense which\ndoes not lay hold of the real agent in itself, any more than sight\nor hearing gives us direct knowledge of matter in itself. From, this\npoint of view introspection is, of course, incompetent to lay hold of\nanything more than the Soul's _phenomena_. But even then the question\nremains, How well can it know the phenomena themselves?\nSome authors take high ground here and claim for it a sort of\ninfallibility. Thus Ueberweg:\n\"When a mental image, as such, is the object of my apprehension,\nthere is no meaning in seeking to distinguish its existence in my\nconsciousness (in me) from its existence out of my consciousness (in\nitself); for the object apprehended is, in this case, one which does\nnot even exist, as the objects of external perception do, in itself\noutside of my consciousness. It exists only within me.\"[189]\nAnd Brentano:\n\"The phenomena inwardly apprehended are true in themselves. As they\nappear--of this the evidence with which they are apprehended is a\nwarrant--so they are in reality. Who, then, can deny that in this a\ngreat superiority of Psychology over the physical sciences comes to\nlight?\"\nAnd again:\n\"No one can doubt whether the psychic condition he apprehends in\nhimself _be_, and be _so_, as he apprehends it. Whoever should doubt\nthis would have reached that _finished_ doubt which destroys itself\nin destroying every fixed point from which to make an attack upon\nknowledge.\"[190]\nOthers have gone to the opposite extreme, and maintained that we\ncan have no introspective cognition of our own minds at all. A\ndeliverance of Auguste Comte to this effect has been so often quoted\nas to be almost classical; and some reference to it seems therefore\nindispensable here.\nPhilosophers, says Comte,[191] have\n\"in these latter days imagined themselves able to distinguish, by a\nvery singular subtlety, two sorts of observation of equal importance,\none external, the other internal, the latter being solely destined for\nthe study of intellectual phenomena.... I limit myself to pointing out\nthe principal consideration which proves clearly that this pretended\ndirect contemplation of the mind by itself is a pure illusion.... It\nis in fact evident that, by an invincible necessity, the human mind\ncan observe directly all phenomena except its own proper states. For\nby whom shall the observation of these be made? It is conceivable\nthat a man might observe himself with respect to the _passions_\nthat animate him, for the anatomical organs of passion are distinct\nfrom those whose function is observation. Though we have all made\nsuch observations on ourselves, they can never have much scientific\nvalue, and the best mode of knowing the passions will always be that\nof observing them from without; for every strong state of passion\n... is necessarily incompatible with the state of observation. But,\nas for observing in the same way _intellectual_ phenomena at the\ntime of their actual presence, that is a manifest impossibility. The\nthinker cannot divide himself into two, of whom one reasons whilst\nthe other observes him reason. The organ observed and the organ\nobserving being, in this case, identical, how could observation take\nplace? This pretended psychological method is then radically null\nand void. On the one hand, they advise you to isolate yourself, as\nfar as possible, from every external sensation, especially every\nintellectual work,--for if you were to busy yourself even with the\nsimplest calculation, what would become of _internal_ observation?--on\nthe other hand, after having with the utmost care attained this state\nof intellectual slumber, you must begin to contemplate the operations\ngoing on in your mind, when nothing there takes place! Our descendants\nwill doubtless see such pretensions some day ridiculed upon the stage.\nThe results of so strange a procedure harmonize entirely with its\nprinciple. For all the two thousand years during which metaphysicians\nhave thus cultivated psychology, they are not agreed about one\nintelligible and established proposition. '_Internal observation_'\ngives almost as many divergent results as there are individuals who\nthink they practise it.\"\nComte hardly could have known anything of the English, and nothing\nof the German, empirical psychology. The 'results' which he had in\nmind when writing were probably scholastic ones, such as principles\nof internal activity, the faculties, the ego, the _liberum arbitrium\nindifferenti\u00e6_, etc. John Mill, in replying to him,[192] says:\n\"It might have occurred to M. Comte that a fact may be studied through\nthe medium of memory, not at the very moment of our perceiving it,\nbut the moment after: and this is really the mode in which our\nbest knowledge of our intellectual acts is generally acquired. We\nreflect on what we have been doing when the act is past, but when\nits impression in the memory is still fresh. Unless in one of these\nways, we could not have acquired the knowledge which nobody denies us\nto have, of what passes in our minds. M. Comte would scarcely have\naffirmed that we are not aware of our own intellectual operations. We\nknow of our observings and our reasonings, either at the very time,\nor by memory the moment after; in either case, by direct knowledge,\nand not (like things done by us in a state of somnambulism) merely\nby their results. This simple fact destroys the whole of M. Comte's\nargument. Whatever we are directly aware of, we can directly observe.\"\nWhere now does the truth lie? Our quotation from Mill is obviously the\none which expresses the most of _practical_ truth about the matter.\nEven the writers who insist upon the absolute veracity of our immediate\ninner apprehension of a conscious state have to contrast with this the\nfallibility of our _memory_ or _observation_ of it, a moment later. No\none has emphasized more sharply than Brentano himself the difference\nbetween the immediate _feltness_ of a feeling, and its perception by\na subsequent reflective act. But which mode of consciousness of it is\nthat which the psychologist must depend on? If to _have_ feelings or\nthoughts in their immediacy were enough, babies in the cradle would\nbe psychologists, and infallible ones. But the psychologist must not\nonly _have_ his mental states in their absolute veritableness, he must\nreport them and write about them, name them, classify and compare\nthem and trace their relations to other things. Whilst alive they are\ntheir own property; it is only _post-mortem_ that they become his\nprey.[193] And as in the naming, classing, and knowing of things\nin general we are notoriously fallible, why not also here? Comte is\nquite right in laying stress on the fact that a feeling, to be named,\njudged, or perceived, must be already past. No subjective state,\nwhilst present, is its own object; its object is always something\nelse. There are, it is true, cases in which we appear to be naming\nour present feeling, and so to be experiencing and observing the same\ninner fact at a single stroke, as when we say 'I feel tired,' 'I am\nangry,' etc. But these are illusory, and a little attention unmasks\nthe illusion. The present conscious state, when I say 'I feel tired,'\nis not the direct state of tire; when I say 'I feel angry,' it is not\nthe direct state of anger. It is the state of _saying-I-feel-tired_,\nof _saying-I-feel-angry_,--entirely different matters, so different\nthat the fatigue and anger apparently included in them are considerable\nmodifications of the fatigue and anger directly felt the previous\ninstant. The act of naming them has momentarily detracted from their\nforce.[194]\nThe only sound grounds on which the infallible veracity of the\nintrospective judgment might be maintained are empirical. If we had\nreason to think it has never yet deceived us, we might continue to\ntrust it. This is the ground actually maintained by Herr Mohr.\n\"The illusions of our senses,\" says this author, \"have undermined\nour belief in the reality of the outer world; but in the sphere of\ninner observation our confidence is intact, for we have never found\nourselves to be in error about the reality of an act of thought or\nfeeling. We have never been misled into thinking we were _not_ in\ndoubt or in anger when these conditions were really states of our\nconsciousness.\"[195]\nBut sound as the reasoning here would be, were the premises correct,\nI fear the latter cannot pass. However it may be with such strong\nfeelings as doubt or anger, about weaker feelings, and about the\n_relations to each other_ of all feelings, we find ourselves in\ncontinual error and uncertainty so soon as we are called on to name and\nclass, and not merely to feel. Who can be sure of the exact _order_\nof his feelings when they are excessively rapid? Who can be sure, in\nhis sensible perception of a chair, how much comes from the eye and\nhow much is supplied out of the previous knowledge of the mind? Who\ncan compare with precision the _quantities_ of disparate feelings\neven where the feelings are very much alike? For instance, where an\nobject is felt now against the back and now against the cheek, which\nfeeling is most extensive? Who can be sure that two given feelings are\nor are not exactly the same? Who can tell which is briefer or longer\nthan the other when both occupy but an instant of time? Who knows, of\nmany actions, for what motive they were done, or if for any motive\nat all? Who can enumerate all the distinct ingredients of such a\ncomplicated feeling as _anger_? and who can tell off-hand whether or no\na perception of _distance_ be a compound or a simple state of mind? The\nwhole mind-stuff controversy would stop if we could decide conclusively\nby introspection that what seem to us elementary feelings are really\nelementary and not compound.\nMr. Sully, in his work on Illusions, has a chapter on those of\nIntrospection from which we might now quote. But, since the rest of\nthis volume will be little more than a collection of illustrations of\nthe difficulty of discovering by direct introspection exactly what our\nfeelings and their relations are, we need not anticipate our own future\ndetails, I but just state our general conclusion that _introspection is\ndifficult and fallible; and that the difficulty is simply that of all\nobservation of whatever kind_. Something is before us; we do our best\nto tell what it is, but in spite of our good will we may go astray, and\ngive a description more applicable to some other sort of thing. The\nonly safeguard is in the final _consensus_ of our farther knowledge\nabout the thing in question, later views correcting earlier ones, until\nat last the harmony of a consistent system is reached. Such a system,\ngradually worked out, is the best guarantee the psychologist can give\nfor the soundness of any particular psychologic observation which he\nmay report. Such a system we ourselves must strive, as far as may be,\nto attain.\nThe English writers on psychology, and the school of Herbart in\nGermany, have in the main contented themselves with such results as\nthe immediate introspection of single individuals gave, and shown what\na body of doctrine they may make. The works of Locke, Hume, Reid,\nHartley, Stewart, Brown, the Mills, will always be classics in this\nline; and in Professor Bain's Treatises we have probably the last word\nof what this method taken mainly by itself can do--the last monument of\nthe youth of our science, still untechnical and generally intelligible,\nlike the Chemistry of Lavoisier, or Anatomy before the microscope was\nused.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_The Experimental Method_. But psychology is passing into a less simple\nphase. Within a few years what one may call a microscopic psychology\nhas arisen in Germany, carried on by experimental methods, asking of\ncourse every moment for introspective data, but eliminating their\nuncertainty by operating on a large scale and taking statistical means.\nThis method taxes patience to the utmost, and could hardly have arisen\nin a country whose natives could be _bored_. Such Germans as Weber,\nFechner, Vierordt, and Wundt obviously cannot; and their success has\nbrought into the field an array of younger experimental psychologists,\nbent on studying the _elements_ of the mental life, dissecting them\nout from the gross results in which they are embedded, and as far as\npossible reducing them to quantitative scales. The simple and open\nmethod of attack having done what it can, the method of patience,\nstarving out, and harassing to death is tried; the Mind must submit\nto a regular _siege_, in which minute advantages gained night and day\nby the forces that hem her in must sum themselves up at last into\nher overthrow. There is little of the grand style about these new\nprism, pendulum, and chronograph-philosophers. They mean business, not\nchivalry. What generous divination, and that superiority in virtue\nwhich was thought by Cicero to give a man the best insight into nature,\nhave failed to do, their spying and scraping, their deadly tenacity and\nalmost diabolic cunning, will doubtless some day bring about.\nNo general description of the methods of experimental psychology\nwould be instructive to one unfamiliar with the instances of their\napplication, so we will waste no words upon the attempt. _The principal\nfields of experimentation_ so far have been: 1) the connection of\nconscious states with their physical conditions, including the whole\nof brain-physiology, and the recent minutely cultivated physiology\nof the sense-organs, together with what is technically known as\n'psycho-physics,' or the laws of correlation between sensations and\nthe outward stimuli by which they are aroused; 2) the analysis of\nspace-perception into its sensational elements; 3) the measurement\nof the _duration_ of the simplest mental processes; 4) that of the\n_accuracy of reproduction_ in the memory of sensible experiences and\nof intervals of space and time; 5) that of the manner in which simple\nmental states _influence each other_, call each other up, or inhibit\neach other's reproduction; 6) that of the _number of facts_ which\nconsciousness can simultaneously discern; finally, 7) that of the\nelementary laws of oblivescence and retention. It must be said that in\nsome of these fields the results have as yet borne little theoretic\nfruit commensurate with the great labor expended in their acquisition.\nBut facts are facts, and if we only get enough of them they are sure\nto combine. New ground will from year to year be broken, and theoretic\nresults will grow. Meanwhile the experimental method has quite changed\nthe face of the science so far as the latter is a record of mere work\ndone.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe _comparative method_, finally, supplements the introspective and\nexperimental methods. This method presupposes a normal psychology of\nintrospection to be established in its main features. But where the\norigin of these features, or their dependence upon one another, is\nin question, it is of the utmost importance to trace the phenomenon\nconsidered through all its possible variations of type and combination.\nSo it has come to pass that instincts of animals are ransacked to throw\nlight on our own; and that the reasoning faculties of bees and ants,\nthe minds of savages, infants, madmen, idiots, the deaf and blind,\ncriminals, and eccentrics, are all invoked in support of this or that\nspecial theory about some part of our own mental life. The history of\nsciences, moral and political institutions, and languages, as types of\nmental product, are pressed into the same service. Messrs. Darwin and\nGalton have set the example of circulars of questions sent out by the\nhundred to those supposed able to reply. The custom has spread, and it\nwill be well for us in the next generation if such circulars be not\nranked among the common pests of life. Meanwhile information grows, and\nresults emerge. There are great sources of error in the comparative\nmethod. The interpretation of the 'psychoses' of animals, savages, and\ninfants is necessarily wild work, in which the personal equation of\nthe investigator has things very much its own way. A savage will be\nreported to have no moral or religious feeling if his actions shock the\nobserver unduly. A child will be assumed without self-consciousness\nbecause he talks of himself in the third person, etc., etc. No rules\ncan be laid down in advance. Comparative observations, to be definite,\nmust usually be made to test some pre-existing hypothesis; and the only\nthing then is to use as much sagacity as you possess, and to be as\ncandid as you can.\nTHE SOURCES OF ERROR IN PSYCHOLOGY.\n_The first of them arises from the Misleading Influence of Speech._\nLanguage was originally made by men who were not psychologists, and\nmost men to-day employ almost exclusively the vocabulary of outward\nthings. The cardinal passions of our life, anger, love, fear, hate,\nhope, and the most comprehensive divisions of our intellectual\nactivity, to remember, expect, think, know, dream, with the broadest\ngenera of \u00e6sthetic feeling, joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, are the only\nfacts of a subjective order which this vocabulary deigns to note by\nspecial words. The elementary qualities of sensation, bright, loud,\nred, blue, hot, cold, are, it is true, susceptible of being used\nin both an objective and a subjective sense. They stand for outer\nqualities and for the feelings which these arouse. But the objective\nsense is the original sense; and still to-day we have to describe a\nlarge number of sensations by the name of the object from which they\nhave most frequently been got. An orange color, an odor of violets,\na cheesy taste, a thunderous sound, a fiery smart, etc., will recall\nwhat I mean. This absence of a special vocabulary for subjective facts\nhinders the study of all but the very coarsest of them. Empiricist\nwriters are very fond of emphasizing one great set of delusions which\nlanguage inflicts on the mind. Whenever we have made a word, they\nsay, to denote a certain group of phenomena, we are prone to suppose\na substantive entity existing beyond the phenomena, of which the word\nshall be the name. But the _lack_ of a word quite as often leads to the\ndirectly opposite error. We are then prone to suppose that no entity\ncan be there; and so we come to overlook phenomena whose existence\nwould be patent to us all, had we only grown up to hear it familiarly\nrecognized in speech.[196] It is hard to focus our attention on the\nnameless, and so there results a certain vacuousness in the descriptive\nparts of most psychologies.\nBut a worse defect than vacuousness comes from the dependence of\npsychology on common speech. Naming our thought by its own objects,\nwe almost all of us assume that as the objects are, so the thought\nmust be. The thought of several distinct things can only consist of\nseveral distinct bits of thought, or 'ideas;' that of an abstract or\nuniversal object can only be an abstract or universal idea. As each\nobject may come and go, be forgotten and then thought of again, it\nis held that the thought of it has a precisely similar independence,\nself-identity, and mobility. The thought of the object's recurrent\nidentity is regarded as the identity of its recurrent thought; and\nthe perceptions of multiplicity, of coexistence, of succession, are\nseverally conceived to be brought about only through a multiplicity, a\ncoexistence, a succession, of perceptions. The continuous flow of the\nmental stream is sacrificed, and in its place an atomism, a brickbat\nplan of construction, is preached, for the existence of which no\ngood introspective grounds can be brought forward, and out of which\npresently grow all sorts of paradoxes and contradictions, the heritage\nof woe of students of the mind.\nThese words are meant to impeach the entire English psychology derived\nfrom Locke and Hume, and the entire German psychology derived from\nHerbart, so far as they both treat 'ideas' as separate subjective\nentities that come and go. Examples will soon make the matter clearer.\nMeanwhile our psychologic insight is vitiated by still other snares.\n'_The Psychologist's Fallacy._' The _great_ snare of the psychologist\nis the _confusion of his own standpoint with that of the mental fact_\nabout which he is making his report. I shall hereafter call this the\n'psychologist's fallacy' _par excellence_. For some of the mischief,\nhere too, language is to blame. The psychologist, as we remarked above\n(p. 183), stands outside of the mental state he speaks of. Both itself\nand its object are objects for him. Now when it is a _cognitive_ state\n(percept, thought, concept, etc.), he ordinarily has no other way of\nnaming it than as the thought, percept, etc., _of that object_. He\nhimself, meanwhile, knowing the self-same object in _his_ way, gets\neasily led to suppose that the thought, which is _of_ it, knows it in\nthe same way in which he knows it, although this is often very far from\nbeing the case.[197] The most fictitious puzzles have been introduced\ninto our science by this means. The so-called question of presentative\nor representative perception, of whether an object is present to the\nthought that thinks it by a counterfeit image of itself, or directly\nand without any intervening image at all; the question of nominalism\nand conceptualism, of the shape in which things are present when only\na general notion of them is before the mind; are comparatively easy\nquestions when once the psychologist's fallacy is eliminated from their\ntreatment,--as we shall ere long see (in Chapter XII).\n_Another variety of the psychologist's fallacy is the assumption\nthat the mental state studied must be conscious of itself as the\npsychologist is conscious of it._ The mental state is aware of itself\nonly from within; it grasps what we call its own content, and nothing\nmore. The psychologist, on the contrary, is aware of it from without,\nand knows its relations with all sorts of other things. What the\nthought sees is only its own object; what the psychologist sees is\nthe thought's object, plus the thought itself, plus possibly all the\nrest of the world. We must be very careful therefore, in discussing a\nstate of mind from the psychologist's point of view, to avoid foisting\ninto its own ken matters that are only there for ours. We must avoid\nsubstituting what we know the consciousness _is_, for what it is a\nconsciousness _of_, and counting its outward, and so to speak physical,\nrelations with other facts of the world, in among the objects of which\nwe set it down as aware. Crude as such a confusion of standpoints seems\nto be when abstractly stated, it is nevertheless a snare into which\nno psychologist has kept himself at all times from falling, and which\nforms almost the entire stock-in-trade of certain schools. We cannot be\ntoo watchful against its subtly corrupting influence.\n_Summary_. To sum up the chapter, Psychology assumes that thoughts\nsuccessively occur, and that they know objects in a world which the\npsychologist also knows. _These thoughts are the subjective data\nof which he treats, and their relations to their objects, to the\nbrain, and to the rest of the world constitute the subject-matter of\npsychologic science._ Its methods are introspection, experimentation,\nand comparison. But introspection is no sure guide to truths _about_\nour mental states; and in particular the poverty of the psychological\nvocabulary leads us to drop out certain states from our consideration,\nand to treat others as if they knew themselves and their objects as the\npsychologist knows both, which is a disastrous fallacy in the science.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[187] On the relation between Psychology and General Philosophy, see G.\nC.

The state of feeling and the state of naming the feeling\nare continuous, and the infallibility of such prompt introspective\njudgments is probably great. But even here the certainty of our\nknowledge ought not to be argued on the _a priori_ ground that\n_percipi_ and _esse_ are in psychology the same.

First of\nall, to its\nTIME-RELATIONS.\nMinds, as we know them, are temporary existences. Whether my mind\nhad a being prior to the birth of my body, whether it shall have\none after the latter's decease, are questions to be decided by my\ngeneral philosophy or theology rather than by what we call 'scientific\nfacts'--I leave out the facts of so-called spiritualism, as being still\nin dispute. Psychology, as a natural science, confines itself to the\npresent life, in which every mind appears yoked to a body through which\nits manifestations appear. In the present world, then, minds precede,\nsucceed, and coexist with each other in the common receptacle of time,\nand of their _collective_ relations to the latter nothing more can\nbe said. The life of the _individual_ consciousness in time seems,\nhowever, to be an interrupted one, so that the question:\n_Are we ever wholly unconscious?_\nbecomes one which must be discussed. Sleep, fainting, coma, epilepsy,\nand other 'unconscious' conditions are apt to break in upon and occupy\nlarge durations of what we nevertheless consider the mental history of\na single man. And, the fact of interruption being admitted, is it not\npossible that it may exist where we do not suspect it, and even perhaps\nin an incessant and fine-grained form?\nThis might happen, and yet the subject himself never know it. We often\ntake ether and have operations performed without a suspicion that our\nconsciousness has suffered a breach. The two ends join each other\nsmoothly over the gap; and only the sight of our wound assures us\nthat we must have been living through a time which for our immediate\nconsciousness was non-existent. Even in sleep this sometimes happens:\nWe think we have had no nap, and it takes the clock to assure us that\nwe are wrong.[198] We thus may live through a real outward time, a time\nknown by the psychologist who studies us, and yet not _feel_ the time,\nor infer it from any inward sign. The question is, how often does this\nhappen? Is consciousness really discontinuous, incessantly interrupted\nand recommencing (from the psychologist's point of view)? and does it\nonly seem continuous to itself by an illusion analogous to that of the\nzoetrope? Or is it at most times as continuous outwardly as it inwardly\nseems?\nIt must be confessed that we can give no rigorous answer to this\nquestion. Cartesians, who hold that the _essence_ of the soul is to\nthink, can of course solve it _a priori_, and explain the appearance of\nthoughtless intervals either by lapses in our ordinary memory, or by\nthe sinking of consciousness to a minimal state, in which perhaps all\nthat it feels is a bare existence which leaves no particulars behind to\nbe recalled. If, however, one have no doctrine about the soul or its\nessence, one is free to take the appearances for what they seem to be,\nand to admit that the mind, as well as the body, may go to sleep.\nLocke was the first prominent champion of this latter view, and the\npages in which he attacks the Cartesian belief are as spirited as any\nin his Essay. \"Every drowsy nod shakes their doctrine who teach that\ntheir soul is always thinking.\" He will not believe that men so easily\nforget. M. Jouffroy and Sir W. Hamilton, attacking the question in the\nsame empirical way, are led to an opposite conclusion. Their reasons,\nbriefly stated, are these:\nIn somnambulism, natural or induced, there is often a great display of\nintellectual activity, followed by complete oblivion of all that has\npassed.[199]\nOn being suddenly awakened from a sleep, however profound, we always\ncatch ourselves in the middle of a dream. Common dreams are often\nremembered for a few minutes after waking, and then irretrievably lost.\nFrequently, when awake and absent-minded, we are visited by thoughts\nand images which the next instant we cannot recall.\nOur insensibility to habitual noises, etc., whilst awake, proves that\nwe can neglect to attend to that which we nevertheless feel. Similarly\nin sleep, we grow inured, and sleep soundly in presence of sensations\nof sound, cold, contact, etc., which at first prevented our complete\nrepose. We have learned to neglect them whilst asleep as we should\nwhilst awake. The mere _sense-impressions_ are the same when the sleep\nis deep as when it is light; the difference must lie in a _judgment_\non the part of the apparently slumbering mind that they are not worth\nnoticing.\nThis discrimination is equally shown by nurses of the sick and mothers\nof infants, who will sleep through much noise of an irrelevant sort,\nbut waken at the slightest stirring of the patient or the babe. This\nlast fact shows the _sense-organ_ to be pervious for sounds.\nMany people have a remarkable faculty of registering when asleep the\nflight of time. They will habitually wake up at the same minute day\nafter day, or will wake punctually at an unusual hour determined upon\novernight. How can this knowledge of the hour (more accurate often than\nanything the waking consciousness shows) be possible without mental\nactivity during the interval?\nSuch are what we may call the classical reasons for admitting that the\nmind is active even when the person afterwards ignores the fact.[200]\nOf late years, or rather, one may say, of late months, they have been\nreinforced by a lot of curious observations made on hysterical and\nhypnotic subjects, which prove the existence of a highly developed\nconsciousness in places where it has hitherto not been suspected at\nall. These observations throw such a novel light upon human nature that\nI must give them in some detail. That at least four different and in\na certain sense rival observers should agree in the same conclusion\njustifies us in accepting the conclusion as true.\n_'Unconsciousness' in Hysterics._\nOne of the most constant symptoms in persons suffering from hysteric\ndisease in its extreme forms consists in alterations of the natural\nsensibility of various parts and organs of the body. Usually the\nalteration is in the direction of defect, or an\u00e6sthesia. One or both\neyes are blind, or color-blind, or there is hemianopsia (blindness\nto one half the field of view), or the field is contracted. Hearing,\ntaste, smell may similarly disappear, in part or in totality. Still\nmore striking are the cutaneous an\u00e6sthesias. The old witch-finders\nlooking for the 'devil's seals' learned well the existence of those\ninsensible patches on the skin of their victims, to which the minute\nphysical examinations of recent medicine have but recently attracted\nattention again. They may be scattered anywhere, but are very apt to\naffect one side of the body. Not infrequently they affect an entire\nlateral half, from head to foot; and the insensible skin of, say, the\nleft side will then be found separated from the naturally sensitive\nskin of the right by a perfectly sharp line of demarcation down the\nmiddle of the front and back. Sometimes, most remarkable of all, the\nentire skin, hands, feet, face, everything, and the mucous membranes,\nmuscles and joints so far as they can be explored, become _completely_\ninsensible without the other vital functions becoming gravely disturbed.\nThese hysterical an\u00e6sthesias can be made to disappear more or less\ncompletely by various odd processes. It has been recently found that\nmagnets, plates of metal, or the electrodes of a battery, placed\nagainst the skin, have this peculiar power. And when one side is\nrelieved in this way, the an\u00e6sthesia is often found to have transferred\nitself to the opposite side, which until then was well. Whether\nthese strange effects of magnets and metals be due to their direct\nphysiological action, or to a prior effect on the patient's mind\n('expectant attention' or 'suggestion') is still a mooted question.\nA still better awakener of sensibility is the hypnotic trance, into\nwhich many of these patients can be very easily placed, and in which\ntheir lost sensibility not infrequently becomes entirely restored.\nSuch returns of sensibility succeed the times of insensibility and\nalternate with them. But Messrs. Pierre Janet[201] and A. Binet[202]\nhave shown that during the times of an\u00e6sthesia, and coexisting with it,\n_sensibility to the an\u00e6sthetic parts is also there, in the form of a\nsecondary consciousness_ entirely cut off from the primary or normal\none, but susceptible of being _tapped_ and made to testify to its\nexistence in various odd ways.\nChief amongst these is what M. Janet calls 'the method of\n_distraction_.' These hysterics are apt to possess a very narrow field\nof attention, and to be unable to think of more than one thing at a\ntime. When talking with any person they forget everything else. \"When\nLucie talked directly with any one,\" says M. Janet, \"she ceased to\nbe able to hear any other person. You may stand behind her, call her\nby name, shout abuse into her ears, without making her turn round;\nor place yourself before her, show her objects, touch her, etc.,\nwithout attracting her notice. When finally she becomes aware of you,\nshe thinks you have just come into the room again, and greets you\naccordingly. This singular forgetfulness makes her liable to tell\nall her secrets aloud, unrestrained by the presence of unsuitable\nauditors.\"\nNow M. Janet found in several subjects like this that if he came up\nbehind them whilst they were plunged in conversation with a third\nparty, and addressed them in a whisper, telling them to raise their\nhand or perform other simple acts, they would obey the order given,\nalthough their _talking_ intelligence was quite unconscious of\nreceiving it. Leading them from one thing to another, he made them\nreply by signs to his whispered questions, and finally made them\nanswer in writing, if a pencil were placed in their hand. The primary\nconsciousness meanwhile went on with the conversation, entirely\nunaware of these performances on the hand's part. The consciousness\nwhich presided over these latter appeared in its turn to be quite as\nlittle disturbed by the upper consciousness's concerns. This _proof\nby 'automatic' writing_, of a secondary consciousness's existence, is\nthe most cogent and striking one; but a crowd of other facts prove the\nsame thing. If I run through them rapidly, the reader will probably be\nconvinced.\n_The apparently an\u00e6sthetic hand_ of these subjects, for one thing,\n_will often adapt itself discriminatingly_ to whatever object may be\nput into it. With a pencil it will make writing movements; into a pair\nof scissors it will put its fingers and will open and shut them, etc.,\netc. The primary consciousness, so to call it, is meanwhile unable to\nsay whether or no _anything_ is in the hand, if the latter be hidden\nfrom sight. \"I put a pair of eyeglasses into L\u00e9onie's an\u00e6sthetic\nhand, this hand opens it and raises it towards the nose, but half way\nthither it enters the field of vision of L\u00e9onie, who sees it and stops\nstupefied: 'Why,' says she, 'I have an eye-glass in my left hand!'\" M.\nBinet found a very curious sort of connection between the apparently\nan\u00e6sthetic skin and the mind in some Salp\u00e9tri\u00e8re-subjects. Things\nplaced in the hand were not felt, but _thought_ of (apparently in\nvisual terms) and in no wise referred by the subject to their starting\npoint in the hand's sensation. A key, a knife, placed in the hand\noccasioned _ideas_ of a key or a knife, but the hand felt nothing.\nSimilarly the subject _thought of_ the number 3, 6, etc., if the hand\nor finger was bent three or six times by the operator, or if he stroked\nit three, six, etc., times.\nIn certain individuals there was found a still odder phenomenon, which\nreminds one of that curious idiosyncrasy of 'colored hearing' of which\na few cases have been lately described with great care by foreign\nwriters. These individuals, namely, _saw_ the impression received by\nthe hand, but could not feel it; and the thing seen appeared by no\nmeans associated with the hand, but more like an independent vision,\nwhich usually interested and surprised the patient. Her hand being\nhidden by a screen, she was ordered to look at another screen and to\ntell of any visual image which might project itself thereon. Numbers\nwould then come, corresponding to the number of times the insensible\nmember was raised, touched, etc. Colored lines and figures would come,\ncorresponding to similar ones traced on the palm; the hand itself or\nits fingers would come when manipulated and finally objects placed in\nit would come; but on the hand itself nothing would ever be felt. Of\ncourse simulation would not be hard here; but M. Binet disbelieves this\n(usually very shallow) explanation to be a probable one in cases in\nquestion.[203]\nThe usual way in which doctors measure the delicacy of our touch is by\nthe compass-points. Two points are normally felt as one whenever they\nare too close together for discrimination; but what is 'too close' on\none part of the skin may seem very far apart on another. In the middle\nof the back or on the thigh, less than 3 inches may be too close;\non the finger-tip a tenth of an inch is far enough apart. Now, as\ntested in this way, with the appeal made to the primary consciousness,\nwhich talks through the mouth and seems to hold the field alone, a\ncertain person's skin may be entirely an\u00e6sthetic and not feel the\ncompass-points at all; and yet this same skin will prove to have a\nperfectly normal sensibility if the appeal be made to that other\nsecondary or sub-consciousness, which expresses itself automatically by\nwriting or by movements of the hand. M. Binet, M. Pierre Janet, and M.\nJules Janet have all found this. The subject, whenever touched, would\nsignify 'one point' or 'two points,' as accurately as if she were a\nnormal person. She would signify it only by these movements; and of the\nmovements themselves her primary self would be as unconscious as of the\nfacts they signified, for what the submerged consciousness makes the\nhand do automatically is unknown to the consciousness which uses the\nmouth.\nMessrs. Bernheim and Pitres have also proved, by observations too\ncomplicated to be given in this spot, that the hysterical blindness\nis no real blindness at all. The eye of an hysteric which is totally\nblind when the other or seeing eye is shut, will do its share of vision\nperfectly well when _both_ eyes are open together. But even where both\neyes are semi-blind from hysterical disease, the method of automatic\nwriting proves that their perceptions exist, only cut off from\ncommunication with the upper consciousness. M. Binet has found the hand\nof his patients unconsciously writing down words which their eyes were\nvainly endeavoring to 'see,' i.e., to bring to the upper consciousness.\nTheir submerged consciousness was of course seeing them, or the hand\ncould not have written as it did. Colors are similarly perceived by\nthe sub-conscious self, which the hysterically color-blind eyes cannot\nbring to the normal consciousness. Pricks, burns, and pinches on the\nan\u00e6sthetic skin, all unnoticed by the upper self, are recollected to\nhave been suffered, and complained of, as soon as the under self gets\na chance to express itself by the passage of the subject into hypnotic\ntrance.\nIt must be admitted, therefore, that _in certain persons_, at least,\n_the total possible consciousness may be split into parts which coexist\nbut mutually ignore each other,_ and share the objects of knowledge\nbetween them. More remarkable still, they are _complementary_. Give an\nobject to one of the consciousnesses, and by that fact you remove it\nfrom the other or others. Barring a certain common fund of information,\nlike the command of language, etc., what the upper self knows the\nunder self is ignorant of, and _vice vers\u00e2_. M. Janet has proved this\nbeautifully in his subject Lucie. The following experiment will serve\nas the type of the rest: In her trance he covered her lap with cards,\neach bearing a number. He then told her that on waking she should\n_not see_ any card whose number was a multiple of three. This is the\nordinary so-called 'post-hypnotic suggestion,' now well known, and\nfor which Lucie was a well-adapted subject. Accordingly, when she was\nawakened and asked about the papers on her lap, she counted and said\nshe saw those only whose number was not a multiple of 3. To the 12,\n18, 9, etc., she was blind. But the _hand_, when the sub-conscious\nself was interrogated by the usual method of engrossing the upper\nself in another conversation, wrote that the only cards in Lucie's\nlap were those numbered 12, 18, 9, etc., and on being asked to pick\nup all the cards which were there, picked up these and let the others\nlie. Similarly when the sight of certain things was suggested to the\nsub-conscious Lucie, the normal Lucie suddenly became partially or\ntotally blind. \"What is the matter? I can't see!\" the normal personage\nsuddenly cried out in the midst of her conversation, when M. Janet\nwhispered to the secondary personage to make use of her eyes. The\nan\u00e6sthesias, paralyses, contractions and other irregularities from\nwhich hysterics suffer seem then to be due to the fact that their\nsecondary personage has enriched itself by robbing the primary one\nof a function which the latter ought to have retained. The curative\nindication is evident: get at the secondary personage, by hypnotization\nor in whatever other way, and make her _give up_ the eye, the skin, the\narm, or whatever the affected part may be. The normal self thereupon\nregains possession, sees, feels, or is able to move again. In this way\nM. Jules Janet easily cured the well-known subject of the Salp\u00e9tri\u00e8re,\nWit...., of all sorts of afflictions which, until he discovered the\nsecret of her deeper trance, it had been difficult to subdue. \"Cessez\ncette mauvaise plaisanterie,\" he said to the secondary self--and the\nlatter obeyed. The way in which the various personages share the stock\nof possible sensations between them seems to be amusingly illustrated\nin this young woman. When awake, her skin is insensible everywhere\nexcept on a zone about the arm where she habitually wears a gold\nbracelet. This zone has feeling; but in the deepest trance, when all\nthe rest of her body feels, this particular zone becomes absolutely\nan\u00e6sthetic.\nSometimes the mutual ignorance of the selves leads to incidents\nwhich are strange enough. The acts and movements performed by the\nsub-conscious self are withdrawn from the conscious one, and the\nsubject will do all sorts of incongruous things of which he remains\nquite unaware. \"I order Lucie [by the method of _distraction_] to make\na _pied de nez_, and her hands go forthwith to the end of her nose.\nAsked what she is doing, she replies that she is doing nothing, and\ncontinues for a long time talking, with no apparent suspicion that her\nfingers are moving in front of her nose. I make her walk about the\nroom; she continues to speak and believes herself sitting down.\"\nM. Janet observed similar acts in a man in alcoholic delirium. Whilst\nthe doctor was questioning him, M. J. made him by whispered suggestion\nwalk, sit, kneel, and even lie down on his face on the floor, he\nall the while believing himself to be standing beside his bed. Such\n_bizarreries_ sound incredible, until one has seen their like. Long\nago, without understanding it, I myself saw a small example of the way\nin which a person's knowledge may be shared by the two selves. A young\nwoman who had been writing automatically was sitting with a pencil\nin her hand, trying to recall at my request the name of a gentleman\nwhom she had once seen. She could only recollect the first syllable.\nHer hand meanwhile, without her knowledge, wrote down the last two\nsyllables. In a perfectly healthy young man who can write with the\nplanchette, I lately found the hand to be entirely an\u00e6sthetic during\nthe writing act; I could prick it severely without the Subject knowing\nthe fact. The _writing on the planchette_, however, accused me in\nstrong terms of hurting the hand. Pricks on the _other_ (non-writing)\nhand, meanwhile, which awakened strong protest from the young man's\nvocal organs, were denied to exist by the self which made the\nplanchette go.[204]\n_We get exactly similar results in the so-called post-hypnotic\nsuggestion._ It is a familiar fact that certain subjects, when told\nduring a trance to perform an act or to experience an hallucination\nafter waking, will when the time comes, obey the command. How is the\ncommand registered? How is its performance so accurately timed? These\nproblems were long a mystery, for the primary personality remembers\nnothing of the trance or the suggestion, and will often trump up an\nimprovised pretext for yielding to the unaccountable impulse which\npossesses the man so suddenly and which he cannot resist. Edmund\nGurney was the first to discover, by means of automatic writing, that\nthe secondary self is awake, keeping its attention constantly fixed\non the command and watching for the signal of its execution. Certain\ntrance-subjects who were also automatic writers, when roused from\ntrance and put to the planchette,--not knowing then what they wrote,\nand having their upper attention fully engrossed by reading aloud,\ntalking, or solving problems in mental arithmetic,--would inscribe the\norders which they had received, together with notes relative to the\ntime elapsed and the time yet to run before the execution.[205] It is\ntherefore to no 'automatism' in the mechanical sense that such acts\nare due: a self presides over them, a split-off, limited and buried,\nbut yet a fully conscious, self. More than this, the buried self often\ncomes to the surface and drives out the other self whilst the acts are\nperforming. In other words, the subject lapses into trance again when\nthe moment arrives for execution, and has no subsequent recollection\nof the act which he has done. Gurney and Beaunis established this\nfact, which has since been verified on a large scale; and Gurney also\nshowed that the patient became _suggestible_ again during the brief\ntime of the performance. M. Janet's observations, in their turn, well\nillustrate the phenomenon.\n\"I tell Lucie to keep her arms raised after she shall have awakened.\nHardly is she in the normal state, when up go her arms above her head,\nbut she pays no attention to them. She goes, comes, converses, holding\nher arms high in the air. If asked what her arms are doing, she is\nsurprised at such a question, and says very sincerely: 'My hands are\ndoing nothing; they are just like yours.'... I command her to weep,\nand when awake she really sobs, but continues in the midst of her\ntears to talk of very gay matters. The sobbing over, there remained no\ntrace of this grief, which seemed to have been quite sub-conscious.\"\nThe primary self often has to invent an hallucination by which to mask\nand hide from its own view the deeds which the other self is enacting.\nL\u00e9onie 3[206] writes real letters whilst L\u00e9onie 1 believes that she\nis knitting; or Lucie 2 really comes to the doctor's office, whilst\nLucie 1 believes herself to be at home. This is a sort of delirium. The\nalphabet, or the series of numbers, when handed over to the attention\nof the secondary personage may for the time be lost to the normal\nself. Whilst the hand writes the alphabet, obediently to command, the\n'subject,' to her great stupefaction, finds herself unable to recall\nit, etc. Few things are more curious than these relations of mutual\nexclusion, of which all gradations exist between the several partial\nconsciousnesses.\n*       *       *       *       *\nHow far this splitting up of the mind into separate consciousnesses may\nexist in each one of us is a problem. M. Janet holds that it is only\npossible where there is abnormal weakness, and consequently a defect\nof unifying or co-ordinating power. An hysterical woman abandons part\nof her consciousness because she is too weak nervously to hold it\ntogether. The abandoned part meanwhile may solidify into a secondary or\nsub-conscious self. In a perfectly sound subject, on the other hand,\nwhat is dropped out of mind at one moment keeps coming back at the\nnext. The whole fund of experiences and knowledges remains integrated,\nand no split-off portions of it can get organized stably enough to form\nsubordinate selves. The stability, monotony, and stupidity of these\nlatter is often very striking. The post-hypnotic sub-consciousness\nseems to think of nothing but the order which it last received;\nthe cataleptic sub-consciousness, of nothing but the last position\nimprinted on the limb. M. Janet could cause definitely circumscribed\nreddening and tumefaction of the skin on two of his subjects, by\nsuggesting to them in hypnotism the hallucination of a mustard-poultice\nof any special shape. \"J'ai tout le temps pens\u00e9 \u00e0 votre sinapisme,\"\nsays the subject, when put back into trance after the suggestion has\ntaken effect. A man N., whom M. Janet operated on at long intervals,\nwas betweenwhiles tampered with by another operator, and when put\nto sleep again by M. Janet, said he was 'too far away to receive\norders, being in Algiers.' The other operator, having suggested that\nhallucination, had forgotten to remove it before waking the subject\nfrom his trance, and the poor passive trance-personality had stuck for\nweeks in the stagnant dream. L\u00e9onie's sub-conscious performances having\nbeen illustrated to a caller, by a '_pied de nez_' executed with her\nleft hand in the course of conversation, when, a year later, she meets\nhim again, up goes the same hand to her nose again, without L\u00e9onie's\nnormal self suspecting the fact.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAll these facts, taken together, form unquestionably the beginning\nof an inquiry which is destined to throw a new light into the very\nabysses of our nature. It is for that reason that I have cited them at\nsuch length in this early chapter of the book. They prove one thing\nconclusively, namely, that _we must never take a person's testimony,\nhowever sincere, that he has felt nothing, as proof positive that\nno feeling has been there._ It may have been there as part of the\nconsciousness of a 'secondary personage,' of whose experiences the\nprimary one whom we are consulting can naturally give no account. In\nhypnotic subjects (as we shall see in a later chapter) just as it\nis the easiest thing in the world to paralyze a movement or member\nby simple suggestion, so it is easy to produce what is called a\nsystematized an\u00e6sthesia by word of command. A systematized an\u00e6sthesia\nmeans an insensibility, not to any one element of things, but to some\none concrete thing or class of things. The subject is made blind or\ndeaf to a certain person in the room and to no one else, and thereupon\ndenies that that person is present, or has spoken, etc. M. P. Janet's\nLucie, blind to some of the numbered cards in her lap (p. 207 above),\nis a case in point. Now when the object is simple, like a red wafer\nor a black cross, the subject, although he denies that he sees it when\nhe looks straight at it, nevertheless gets a 'negative after-image' of\nit when he looks away again, showing that the _optical impression_ of\nit has been received. Moreover reflection shows that such a subject\nmust _distinguish the object from others like it in order to be blind\nto it._ Make him blind to one person in the room, set all the persons\nin a row, and tell him to count them. He will count all but that one.\nBut how can he tell _which_ one not to count without recognizing who\nhe is? In like manner, make a stroke on paper or blackboard, and tell\nhim it is not there, and he will see nothing but the clean paper or\nboard. Next (he not looking) surround the original stroke with other\nstrokes exactly like it, and ask him what he sees. He will point out\none by one all the new strokes, and omit the original one every time,\nno matter how numerous the new strokes may be, or in what order they\nare arranged. Similarly, if the original single stroke to which he is\nblind be _doubled_ by a prism of some sixteen degrees placed before one\nof his eyes (both being kept open), he will say that he now sees _one_\nstroke, and point in the direction in which the image seen through the\nprism lies, ignoring still the original stroke.\nObviously, then, he is not blind to the _kind_ of stroke in the least.\nHe is blind only to one individual stroke of that kind in a particular\nposition on the board or paper--that is to a particular complex object;\nand, paradoxical as it may seem to say so, he must distinguish it with\ngreat accuracy from others like it, in order to remain blind to it when\nthe others are brought near. He discriminates it, as a preliminary to\nnot seeing it at all.\nAgain, when by a prism before one eye a previously invisible line has\nbeen made visible to that eye, and the other eye is thereupon closed\nor screened, _its_ closure makes no difference; the line still remains\nvisible. But if then the prism be removed, the line will disappear even\nto the eye which a moment ago saw it, and both eyes will revert to\ntheir original blind state.\nWe have, then, to deal in these cases neither with a blindness of the\neye itself, nor with a mere failure to notice, but with something much\nmore complex; namely, an active counting out and positive exclusion of\ncertain objects. It is as when one 'cuts' an acquaintance, 'ignores'\na claim, or 'refuses to be influenced' by a consideration. But the\nperceptive activity which works to this result is disconnected from the\nconsciousness which is personal, so to speak, to the subject, and makes\nof the object concerning which the suggestion is made, its own private\npossession and prey.[207]\nThe mother who is asleep to every sound but the stirrings of her\nbabe, evidently has the babe-portion of her auditory sensibility\nsystematically awake. Relatively to that, the rest of her mind is\nin a state of systematized an\u00e6sthesia. That department, split off\nand disconnected from the sleeping part, can none the less wake the\nlatter up in case of need. So that on the whole the quarrel between\nDescartes and Locke as to whether the mind ever sleeps is less near\nto solution than ever. On _a priori_ speculative grounds Locke's view\nthat thought and feeling may at times wholly disappear seems the more\nplausible. As glands cease to secrete and muscles to contract, so the\nbrain should sometimes cease to carry currents, and with this minimum\nof its activity might well coexist a minimum of consciousness. On the\nother hand, we see how deceptive are appearances, and are forced to\nadmit that a part of consciousness may sever its connections with other\nparts and yet continue to be. On the whole it is best to abstain from a\nconclusion. The science of the near future will doubtless answer this\nquestion more wisely than we can now.\nLet us turn now to consider the\nRELATIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO SPACE.\nThis is the problem known in the history of philosophy as the _question\nof the seat of the soul_. It has given rise to much literature, but\nwe must ourselves treat it very briefly. Everything depends on what\nwe conceive the soul to be, an extended or an inextended entity. If\nthe former, it may occupy a seat. If the latter, it may not; though\nit has been thought that even then it might still have a _position_.\nMuch hair-splitting has arisen about the possibility of an inextended\nthing nevertheless being _present_ throughout a certain amount of\nextension. We must distinguish the kinds of presence. In some manner\nour consciousness is 'present' to everything with which it is in\nrelation. I am _cognitively_ present to Orion whenever I perceive that\nconstellation, but I am not _dynamically_ present there, I work no\neffects. To my brain, however, I am dynamically present, inasmuch as\nmy thoughts and feelings seem to react upon the processes thereof. If,\nthen, by the seat of the mind is meant nothing more than the locality\nwith which it stands in immediate dynamic relations, we are certain\nto be right in saying that its seat is somewhere in the cortex of the\nbrain. Descartes, as is well known, thought that the inextended soul\nwas immediately present to the pineal gland. Others, as Lotze in his\nearlier days, and W. Volkmann, think its position must be at some\npoint of the structureless matrix of the anatomical brain-elements,\nat which point they suppose that all nerve-currents may cross and\ncombine. The scholastic doctrine is that the soul is totally present,\nboth in the whole and in each and every part of the body. This mode\nof presence is said to be due to the soul's inextended nature and to\nits simplicity. Two extended entities could only correspond in space\nwith one another, part to part,--but not so does the soul, which has\nno parts, correspond with the body. Sir Wm. Hamilton and Professor\nBowen defend something like this view. I. H. Fichte, Ulrici, and, among\nAmerican philosophers, Mr. J. E. Walter,[208] maintain the soul to be a\nspace-filling principle. Fichte calls it the inner body, Ulrici likens\nit to a fluid of non-molecular composition. These theories remind us\nof the 'theosophic' doctrines of the present day, and carry us back to\ntimes when the soul as vehicle of consciousness was not discriminated,\nas it now is, from the vital principle presiding over the formation of\nthe body. Plato gave head, breast, and abdomen to the immortal reason,\nthe courage, and the appetites, as their seats respectively. Aristotle\nargues that the heart is the sole seat. Elsewhere we find the blood,\nthe brain, the lungs, the liver the kidneys even, in turn assigned as\nseat of the whole or part of the soul.[209]\nThe truth is that if the thinking principle is extended we neither know\nits form nor its seat; whilst if unextended, it is absurd to speak\nof its having any space-relations at all. Space-relations we shall\nsee hereafter to be _sensible_ things. The only objects that can have\nmutual relations of position are objects that are perceived coexisting\nin the same felt space. A thing not perceived at all, such as the\ninextended soul must be, cannot coexist with any perceived objects in\nthis way. No lines can be felt stretching from it to the other objects.\nIt can form no terminus to any space-interval. It can therefore in no\nintelligible sense enjoy position. Its relations cannot be spatial,\nbut must be exclusively cognitive or dynamic, as we have seen. So far\nas they are dynamic, to talk of the soul being 'present' is only a\nfigure of speech. Hamilton's doctrine that the soul is present to the\nwhole body is at any rate false: for cognitively its presence extends\nfar beyond the body, and dynamically it does not extend beyond the\nbrain.[210]\nTHE RELATIONS OF MINDS TO OTHER OBJECTS\nare either relations to _other minds_, or to _material things_. The\nmaterial things are either the mind's _own brain_, on the one hand, or\n_anything else_, on the other. The relations of a mind to its own brain\nare of a unique and utterly mysterious sort; we discussed them in the\nlast two chapters, and can add nothing to that account.\nThe mind's relations to other objects than the brain are _cognitive\nand emotional_ relations exclusively, so far as we know. It _knows_\nthem, and it inwardly _welcomes or rejects_ them, but it has no other\ndealings with them. When it seems to _act_ upon them, it only does so\nthrough the intermediary of its own body, so that not it but the body\nis what acts on them, and the brain must first act upon the body. The\nsame is true when other things seem to act on it--they only act on\nthe body, and through that on its brain.[211] All that it _can_ do\n_directly_ is to know other things, misknow or ignore them, and to find\nthat they interest it, in this fashion or in that.\nNow the _relation of knowing_ is the most mysterious thing in the\nworld. If we ask how one thing _can_ know another we are led into the\nheart of _Erkenntnisstheorie_ and metaphysics. The psychologist, for\nhis part, does not consider the matter so curiously as this. Finding\na world before him which he cannot but believe that _he_ knows, and\nsetting himself to study his own past thoughts, or someone else's\nthoughts, of what he believes to be that same world; he cannot but\nconclude that those other thoughts know it after their fashion even as\nhe knows it after his. Knowledge becomes for him an ultimate relation\nthat must be admitted, whether it be explained or not, just like\ndifference or resemblance, which no one seeks to explain.\nWere our topic Absolute Mind instead of being the concrete minds of\nindividuals dwelling in the natural world, we could not tell whether\nthat Mind had the function of knowing or not, as knowing is commonly\nunderstood. We might learn the complexion of its thoughts; but, as we\nshould have no realities outside of it to compare them with,--for if\nwe had, the Mind would not be Absolute,--we could not criticise them,\nand find them either right or wrong; and we should have to call them\nsimply the thoughts, and not the _knowledge_, of the Absolute Mind.\nFinite minds, however, can be judged in a different way, because the\npsychologist himself can go bail for the independent reality of the\nobjects of which they think. He knows these to exist outside as well as\ninside the minds in question; he thus knows whether the minds think and\n_know_, or only think; and though his knowledge is of course that of a\nfallible mortal, there is nothing in the conditions that should make it\nmore likely to be wrong in this case than in any other.\nNow by what tests does the psychologist decide whether the state of\nmind he is studying is a bit of knowledge, or only a subjective fact\nnot referring to anything outside itself?\nHe uses the tests we all practically use. If the state of mind\n_resembles_ his own idea of a certain reality; or if without resembling\nhis idea of it, it seems to imply that reality and refer to it by\noperating upon it through the bodily organs; or even if it resembles\nand operates on some other reality that implies, and leads up to,\nand terminates in, the first one,--in either or all of these cases\nthe psychologist admits that the state of mind takes cognizance,\ndirectly or remotely, distinctly or vaguely, truly or falsely, of the\nreality's nature and position in the world. If, on the other hand, the\nmental state under examination neither resembles nor operates on any\nof the realities known to the psychologist, he calls it a subjective\nstate pure and simple, possessed of no cognitive worth. If, again,\nit resemble a reality or a set of realities as he knows them, but\naltogether fail to operate on them or modify their course by producing\nbodily motions which the psychologist sees, then the psychologist, like\nall of us, may be in doubt. Let the mental state, for example, occur\nduring the sleep of its subject. Let the latter dream of the death of\na certain man, and let the man simultaneously die. Is the dream a mere\ncoincidence, or a veritable cognition of the death? Such puzzling cases\nare what the Societies for 'Psychical Research' are collecting and\ntrying to interpret in the most reasonable way.\nIf the dream were the only one of the kind the subject ever had in\nhis life, if the context of the death in the dream differed in many\nparticulars from the real death's context, and if the dream led to\nno action about the death, unquestionably we should all call it a\nstrange coincidence, and naught besides. But if the death in the dream\nhad a long context, agreeing point for point with every feature that\nattended the real death; if the subject were constantly having such\ndreams, all equally perfect, and if on awaking he had a habit of acting\nimmediately as if they were true and so getting 'the start' of his more\ntardily informed neighbors,--we should probably all have to admit that\nhe had some mysterious kind of clairvoyant power, that his dreams in\nan inscrutable way knew just those realities which they figured, and\nthat the word 'coincidence' failed to touch the root of the matter.\nAnd whatever doubts any one preserved would completely vanish if it\nshould appear that from the midst of his dream he had the power of\n_interfering_ with the course of the reality, and making the events in\nit turn this way or that, according as he dreamed they should. Then at\nleast it would be certain that he and the psychologist were dealing\nwith the _same_. It is by such tests as these that we are convinced\nthat the waking minds of our fellows and our own minds know the same\nexternal world.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_The psychologist's attitude towards cognition_ will be so important in\nthe sequel that we must not leave it until it is made perfectly clear.\n_It is a thoroughgoing dualism._ It supposes two elements, mind knowing\nand thing known, and treats them as irreducible. Neither gets out of\nitself or into the other, neither in any way _is_ the other, neither\n_makes_ the other. They just stand face to face in a common world, and\none simply knows, or is known unto, its counterpart. This singular\nrelation is not to be expressed in any lower terms, or translated into\nany more intelligible name. Some sort of _signal_ must be given by the\nthing to the mind's brain, or the knowing will not occur--we find as a\nmatter of fact that the mere _existence_ of a thing outside the brain\nis not a sufficient cause for our knowing it: it must strike the brain\nin some way, as well as be there, to be known. But the brain being\nstruck, the knowledge is constituted by a new construction that occurs\naltogether _in_ the mind. The thing remains the same whether known or\nnot.[212] And when once there, the knowledge may remain there, whatever\nbecomes of the thing.\nBy the ancients, and by unreflecting people perhaps to-day, knowledge\nis explained as the _passage_ of something from without into the\nmind--the latter, so far, at least, as its sensible affections go,\nbeing passive and receptive. But even in mere sense-impression the\nduplication of the object by an inner construction must take place.\nConsider, with Professor Bowne, what happens when two people converse\ntogether and know each other's mind.\n\"No thoughts leave the mind of one and cross into the mind of the\nother. When we speak of an exchange of thought, even the crudest mind\nknows that this is a mere figure of speech.... To perceive another's\nthought, we must construct his thought within ourselves;... this\nthought is our own and is strictly original with us. At the same time\nwe owe it to the other; and if it had not originated with him, it\nwould probably not have originated with us. But what has the other\ndone?... This: by an entirely mysterious world-order, the speaker is\nenabled to produce a series of signs which are totally unlike [the]\nthought, but which, by virtue of the same mysterious order, act\nas a series of incitements upon the hearer, so that he constructs\nwithin himself the corresponding mental state. The act of the speaker\nconsists in availing himself of the proper incitements. The act of\nthe hearer is immediately only the reaction of the soul against the\nincitement.... All communion between finite minds is of this sort....\nProbably no reflecting person would deny this conclusion, but when\nwe say that what is thus true of perception of another's thought\nis equally true of the perception of the outer world in general,\nmany minds will be disposed to question, and not a few will deny it\noutright. Yet there is no alternative but to affirm that to perceive\nthe universe we must construct it in thought, and that our knowledge\nof the universe is but the unfolding of the mind's inner nature....\nBy describing the mind as a waxen tablet, and things as impressing\nthemselves upon it, we seem to get great insight until we think to\nask where this extended tablet is, and how things stamp themselves\non it, and how the perceptive act would be explained even if they\ndid.... The immediate antecedents of sensation and perception are\na series of nervous changes in the brain. Whatever we know of the\nouter world is revealed only in and through these nervous changes.\nBut these are totally unlike the objects assumed to exist as their\ncauses. If we might conceive the mind as in the light, and in direct\ncontact with its objects, the imagination at least would be comforted;\nbut when we conceive the mind as coming in contact with the outer\nworld only in the dark chamber of the skull, and then not in contact\nwith the objects perceived, but only with a series of nerve-changes\nof which, moreover, it knows nothing, it is plain that the object\nis a long way off. All talk of pictures, impressions, etc., ceases\nbecause of the lack of all the conditions to give such figures any\nmeaning. It is not even clear that we shall ever find our way out\nof the darkness into the world of light and reality again. We begin\nwith complete trust in physics and the senses, and are forthwith\nled away from the object into a nervous labyrinth, where the object\nis entirely displaced by a set of nervous changes which are totally\nunlike anything but themselves. Finally, we land in the dark chamber\nof the skull. The object has gone completely, and knowledge has not\nyet appeared. Nervous signs are the raw material of all knowledge of\nthe outer world according to the most decided realism. But in order\nto pass beyond these signs into a knowledge of the outer world, we\nmust posit an interpreter who shall read back these signs into their\nobjective meaning. But that interpreter, again, must implicitly\ncontain the meaning of the universe within itself; and these signs are\nreally but excitations which cause the soul to unfold what is within\nitself. Inasmuch as by common consent the soul communicates with the\nouter world only through these signs, and never comes nearer to the\nobject than such signs can bring it, it follows that the principles\nof interpretation must be in the mind itself, and that the resulting\nconstruction is primarily only an expression of the mind's own nature.\nAll reaction is of this sort; it expresses the nature of the reacting\nagent, and knowledge comes under the same head, this fact makes it\nnecessary for us either to admit a pre-established harmony between the\nlaws and nature of thought and the laws and nature of things, or else\nto allow that the objects of perception, the universe as it appears,\nare purely phenomenal, being but the way in which the mind reacts\nagainst the ground of its sensations.\"[213]\nThe dualism of Object and Subject and their pre-established harmony are\nwhat the psychologist as such must assume, whatever ulterior monistic\nphilosophy he may, as an individual who has the right also to be a\nmetaphysician, have in reserve. I hope that this general point is now\nmade clear, so that we may leave it, and descend to some distinctions\nof detail.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_There are two kinds of knowledge_ broadly and practically\ndistinguishable: we may call them respectively _knowledge of\nacquaintance_ and _knowledge-about_. Most languages express the\ndistinction; thus, _\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u03b5\u1f76\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9; noscere, scire; kennen, wissen;\nconna\u00eetre, savoir_.[214] I am acquainted with many people and things,\nwhich I know very little about, except their presence in the places\nwhere I have met them. I know the color blue when I see it, and the\nflavor of a pear when I taste it; I know an inch when I move my finger\nthrough it; a second of time, when I feel it pass; an effort of\nattention when I make it; a difference between two things when I notice\nit; but _about_ the inner nature of these facts or what makes them\nwhat they are, I can say nothing at all. I cannot impart acquaintance\nwith them to any one who has not already made it himself. I cannot\n_describe_ them, make a blind man guess what blue is like, define to a\nchild a syllogism, or tell a philosopher in just what respect distance\nis just what it is, and differs from other forms of relation. At most,\nI can say to my friends, Go to certain places and act in certain ways,\nand these objects will probably come. All the elementary natures of the\nworld, its highest genera, the simple qualities of matter and mind,\ntogether with the kinds of relation that subsist between them, must\neither not be known at all, or known in this dumb way of acquaintance\nwithout _knowledge-about_. In minds able to speak at all there is, it\nis true, _some_ knowledge about everything. Things can at least be\nclassed, and the times of their appearance told. But in general, the\nless we analyze a thing, and the fewer of its relations we perceive,\nthe less we know about it and the more our familiarity with it is of\nthe acquaintance-type. The two kinds of knowledge are, therefore, as\nthe human mind practically exerts them, relative terms. That is, the\nsame thought of a thing may be called knowledge-about it in comparison\nwith a simpler thought, or acquaintance with it in comparison with a\nthought of it that is more articulate and explicit still.\nThe grammatical sentence expresses this. Its 'subject' stands for an\nobject of acquaintance which, by the addition of the predicate, is to\nget something known about it. We may already know a good deal, when\nwe hear the subject named--its name may have rich connotations. But,\nknow we much or little then, we know more still when the sentence is\ndone. We can relapse at will into a mere condition of acquaintance with\nan object by scattering our attention and staring at it in a vacuous\ntrance-like way. We can ascend to knowledge _about_ it by rallying our\nwits and proceeding to notice and analyze and think. What we are only\nacquainted with is only _present_ to our minds; we _have_ it, or the\nidea of it. But when we know about it, we do more than merely have\nit; we seem, as we think over its relations, to subject it to a sort\nof _treatment_ and to _operate_ upon it with our thought. The words\n_feeling_ and _thought_ give voice to the antithesis. Through feelings\nwe become acquainted with things, but only by our thoughts do we know\nabout them. Feelings are the germ and starting point of cognition,\nthoughts the developed tree. The minimum of grammatical subject, of\nobjective presence, of reality known about, the mere beginning of\nknowledge, must be named by the word that says the least. Such a word\nis the interjection, as _lo! there! ecco! voil\u00e0!_ or the article or\ndemonstrative pronoun introducing the sentence, as _the, it, that_. In\nChapter XII we shall see a little deeper into what this distinction,\nbetween the mere mental having or feeling of an object and the thinking\nof it, portends.\nThe mental states usually distinguished as feelings are the _emotions_,\nand the _sensations_ we get from skin, muscle, viscus, eye, ear, nose,\nand palate. The 'thoughts,' as recognized in popular parlance, are the\n_conceptions_ and _judgments_. When we treat of these mental states in\nparticular we shall have to say a word about the cognitive function and\nvalue of each. It may perhaps be well to notice now that our senses\nonly give us acquaintance with facts of body, and that of the mental\nstates of other persons we only have conceptual knowledge. Of our own\npast states of mind we take cognizance in a peculiar way. They are\n'objects of memory,' and appear to us endowed with a sort of warmth and\nintimacy that makes the perception of them seem more like a process of\nsensation than like a thought.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[198] Messrs. Payton Spence (Journal of Spec. Phil., x, 338, xiv,\n286) and M. M. Garver (Amer. Jour. of Science, 3d series, xx,\n189) argue, the one from speculative, the other from experimental\ngrounds, that, the physical condition of consciousness being neural\nvibration, the consciousness must itself be incessantly interrupted by\nunconsciousness--about fifty times a second, according to Garver.\n[199] That the appearance of mental activity here is real can be proved\nby suggesting to the 'hypnotized' somnambulist that he shall remember\nwhen he awakes.

Most books start with\nsensations, as the simplest mental facts, and proceed synthetically,\nconstructing each higher stage from those below it. But this is\nabandoning the empirical method of investigation. No one ever had a\nsimple sensation by itself. Consciousness, from our natal day, is of a\nteeming multiplicity of objects and relations, and what we call simple\nsensations are results of discriminative attention, pushed often to a\nvery high degree. It is astonishing what havoc is wrought in psychology\nby admitting at the outset apparently innocent suppositions, that\nnevertheless contain a flaw. The bad consequences develop themselves\nlater on, and are irremediable, being woven through the whole texture\nof the work. The notion that sensations, being the simplest things, are\nthe first things to take up in psychology is one of these suppositions.\nThe only thing which psychology has a right to postulate at the outset\nis the fact of thinking itself, and that must first be taken up and\nanalyzed. If sensations then prove to be amongst the elements of the\nthinking, we shall be no worse off as respects them than if we had\ntaken them for granted at the start.\n_The first fact for us, then, as psychologists, is that thinking of\nsome sort goes on._ I use the word thinking, in accordance with what\nwas said on p. 186, for every form of consciousness indiscriminately.\nIf we could say in English 'it thinks,' as we say 'it rains 'or 'it\nblows,' we should be stating the fact most simply and with the minimum\nof assumption. As we cannot, we must simply say that _thought goes on_.\nFIVE CHARACTERS IN THOUGHT.\nHow does it go on? We notice immediately five important characters in\nthe process, of which it shall be the duty of the present chapter to\ntreat in a general way:\n1) Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness.\n2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing.\n3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous.\n4) It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself.\n5) It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion\nof others, and welcomes or rejects--_chooses_ from among them, in a\nword--all the while.\nIn considering these five points successively, we shall have to plunge\n_in medias res_ as regards our vocabulary, and use psychological terms\nwhich can only be adequately defined in later chapters of the book.\nBut every one knows what the terms mean in a rough way; and it is only\nin a rough way that we are now to take them. This chapter is like a\npainter's first charcoal sketch upon his canvas, in which no niceties\nappear.\n1) _Thought tends to Personal Form._\nWhen I say _every thought is part of a personal consciousness_,\n'personal consciousness' is one of the terms in question. Its meaning\nwe know so long as no one asks us to define it, but to give an accurate\naccount of it is the most difficult of philosophic tasks. This task we\nmust confront in the next chapter; here a preliminary word will suffice.\nIn this room--this lecture-room, say--there are a multitude of\nthoughts, yours and mine, some of which cohere mutually, and some not.\nThey are as little each-for-itself and reciprocally independent as\nthey are all-belonging-together. They are neither: no one of them is\nseparate, but each belongs with certain others and with none beside.\nMy thought belongs with my other thoughts, and your thought with your\nother thoughts. Whether anywhere in the room there be a mere thought,\nwhich is nobody's thought, we have no means of ascertaining, for we\nhave no experience of its like. The only states of consciousness that\nwe naturally deal with are found in personal consciousnesses, minds,\nselves, concrete particular I's and you's.\nEach of these minds keeps its own thoughts to itself. There is no\ngiving or bartering between them. No thought even comes into direct\n_sight_ of a thought in another personal consciousness than its own.\nAbsolute insulation, irreducible pluralism, is the law. It seems as if\nthe elementary psychic fact were not _thought_ or _this thought_ or\n_that thought_, but _my thought_, every thought being _owned_. Neither\ncontemporaneity, nor proximity in space, nor similarity of quality and\ncontent are able to fuse thoughts together which are sundered by this\nbarrier of belonging to different personal minds. The breaches between\nsuch thoughts are the most absolute breaches in nature. Everyone will\nrecognize this to be true, so long as the existence of _something_\ncorresponding to the term 'personal mind' is all that is insisted on,\nwithout any particular view of its nature being implied. On these\nterms the personal self rather than the thought might be treated as\nthe immediate datum in psychology. The universal conscious fact is\nnot 'feelings and thoughts exist,' but 'I think' and 'I feel.'[216]\nNo psychology, at any rate, can question the _existence_ of personal\nselves. The worst a psychology can do is so to interpret the nature of\nthese selves as to rob them of their worth. A French writer, speaking\nof our ideas, says somewhere in a fit of anti-spiritualistic excitement\nthat, misled by certain peculiarities which they display, we 'end by\npersonifying' the procession which they make,--such personification\nbeing regarded by him as a great philosophic blunder on our part. It\ncould only be a blunder if the notion of personality meant something\nessentially different from anything to be found in the mental\nprocession. But if that procession be itself the very 'original' of the\nnotion of personality, to personify it cannot possibly be wrong. It is\nalready personified. There are no marks of personality to be gathered\n_aliunde_, and then found lacking in the train of thought. It has them\nall already; so that to whatever farther analysis we may subject that\nform of personal selfhood under which thoughts appear, it is, and must\nremain, true that the thoughts which psychology studies do continually\ntend to appear as parts of personal selves.\nI say 'tend to appear' rather than 'appear,' on account of those facts\nof sub-conscious personality, automatic writing, etc., of which we\nstudied a few in the last chapter. The buried feelings and thoughts\nproved now to exist in hysterical an\u00e6sthetics, in recipients of\npost-hypnotic suggestion, etc., themselves are parts of _secondary\npersonal selves_. These selves are for the most part very stupid and\ncontracted, and are cut off at ordinary times from communication with\nthe regular and normal self of the individual; but still they form\nconscious unities, have continuous memories, speak, write, invent\ndistinct names for themselves, or adopt names that are suggested; and,\nin short, are entirely worthy of that title of secondary personalities\nwhich is now commonly given them. According to M. Janet these secondary\npersonalities are always abnormal, and result from the splitting of\nwhat ought to be a single complete self into two parts, of which one\nlurks in the background whilst the other appears on the surface as\nthe only self the man or woman has. For our present purpose it is\nunimportant whether this account of the origin of secondary selves is\napplicable to all possible cases of them or not, for it certainly is\ntrue of a large number of them. Now although the _size_ of a secondary\nself thus formed will depend on the number of thoughts that are\nthus split-off from the main consciousness, the _form_ of it tends\nto personality, and the later thoughts pertaining to it remember\nthe earlier ones and adopt them as their own. M. Janet caught the\nactual moment of inspissation (so to speak) of one of these secondary\npersonalities in his an\u00e6sthetic somnambulist Lucie. He found that when\nthis young woman's attention was absorbed in conversation with a third\nparty, her an\u00e6sthetic hand would write simple answers to questions\nwhispered to her by himself. \"Do you hear?\" he asked. \"_No,_\" was the\nunconsciously written reply. \"But to answer you must hear.\" \"_Yes,\nquite so._\" \"Then how do you manage?\" \"_I don't know._\" \"There must be\nsome one who hears me.\" \"_Yes._\" \"Who?\" \"_Someone other than Lucie._\"\n\"Ah! another person. Shall we give her a name?\" \"_No._\" \"Yes, it will\nbe more convenient.\" \"_Well, Adrienne, then._\" \"Once baptized, the\nsubconscious personage,\" M. Janet continues, \"grows more definitely\noutlined and displays better her psychological characters. In\nparticular she shows us that she is conscious of the feelings excluded\nfrom the consciousness of the primary or normal personage. She it is\nwho tells us that I am pinching the arm or touching the little finger\nin which Lucie for so long has had no tactile sensations.\"[217]\nIn other cases the adoption of the name by the secondary self is more\nspontaneous. I have seen a number of incipient automatic writers\nand mediums as yet imperfectly 'developed,' who immediately and of\ntheir own accord write and speak in the name of departed spirits.\nThese may be public characters, as Mozart, Faraday, or real persons\nformerly known to the subject, or altogether imaginary beings.\nWithout prejudicing the question of real 'spirit-control' in the more\ndeveloped sorts of trance-utterance, I incline to think that these\n(often deplorably unintelligent) rudimentary utterances are the work\nof an inferior fraction of the subject's own natural mind, set free\nfrom control by the rest, and working after a set pattern fixed by the\nprejudices of the social environment. In a spiritualistic community we\nget optimistic messages, whilst in an ignorant Catholic village the\nsecondary personage calls itself by the name of a demon, and proffers\nblasphemies and obscenities, instead of telling us how happy it is in\nthe summer-land.[218]\nBeneath these tracts of thought, which, however rudimentary, are\nstill organized selves with a memory, habits, and sense of their own\nidentity, M. Janet thinks that the facts of catalepsy in hysteric\npatients drive us to suppose that there are thoughts quite unorganized\nand impersonal. A patient in cataleptic trance (which can be produced\nartificially in certain hypnotized subjects) is without memory on\nwaking, and seems insensible and unconscious as long as the cataleptic\ncondition lasts. If, however, one raises the arm of such a subject it\nstays in that position, and the whole body can thus be moulded like\nwax under the hands of the operator, retaining for a considerable\ntime whatever attitude he communicates to it. In hysterics whose arm,\nfor example, is an\u00e6sthetic, the same thing may happen. The an\u00e6sthetic\narm may remain passively in positions which it is made to assume; or\nif the hand be taken and made to hold a pencil and trace a certain\nletter, it will continue tracing that letter indefinitely on the\npaper. These acts, until recently, were supposed to be accompanied by\nno consciousness at all: they were physiological reflexes. M. Janet\nconsiders with much more plausibility that feeling escorts them.\nThe feeling is probably merely that of the position or movement of\nthe limb, and it produces no more than its natural effects when it\ndischarges into the motor centres which keep the position maintained,\nor the movement incessantly renewed.[219] Such thoughts as these, says\nM. Janet, \"are known by _no one_, for disaggregated sensations reduced\nto a state of mental dust are not synthetized in any personality.\"[220]\nHe admits, however, that these very same unutterably stupid thoughts\ntend to develop memory,--the cataleptic ere long moves her arm at a\nbare hint; so that they form no important exception to the law that all\nthought tends to assume the form of personal consciousness.\n2) _Thought is in Constant Change._\nI do not mean necessarily that no one state of mind has any\nduration--even if true, that would be hard to establish. The change\nwhich I have more particularly in view is that which takes place in\nsensible intervals of time; and the result on which I wish to lay\nstress is this, that _no state once gone can recur and be identical\nwith what it was before_. Let us begin with Mr. Shadworth Hodgson's\ndescription:\n\"I go straight to the facts, without saying I go to perception, or\nsensation, or thought, or any special mode at all. What I find when I\nlook at my consciousness at all is that what I cannot divest myself\nof, or not have in consciousness, if I have any consciousness at all,\nis a sequence of different feelings. I may shut my eyes and keep\nperfectly still, and try not to contribute anything of my own will;\nbut whether I think or do not think, whether I perceive external\nthings or not, I always have a succession of different feelings.\nAnything else that I may have also, of a more special character,\ncomes in as parts of this succession, Not to have the succession of\ndifferent feelings is not to be conscious at all.... The chain of\nconsciousness is a sequence of _differents_.\"[221]\nSuch a description as this can awaken no possible protest from any\none. We all recognize as different great classes of our conscious\nstates. Now we are seeing, now hearing; now reasoning, now willing;\nnow recollecting, now expecting; now loving, now hating; and in a\nhundred other ways we know our minds to be alternately engaged. But\nall these are complex states. The aim of science is always to reduce\ncomplexity to simplicity; and in psychological science we have the\ncelebrated 'theory of _ideas_' which, admitting the great difference\namong each other of what may be called concrete conditions of mind,\nseeks to show how this is all the resultant effect of variations in\nthe _combination_ of certain simple elements of consciousness that\nalways remain the same. These mental atoms or molecules are what\nLocke called 'simple ideas.' Some of Locke's successors made out that\nthe only simple ideas were the sensations strictly so called. Which\nideas the simple ones may be does not, however, now concern us. It is\nenough that certain philosophers have thought they could see under the\ndissolving-view-appearance of the mind elementary facts of _any_ sort\nthat remained unchanged amid the flow.\nAnd the view of these philosophers has been called little into\nquestion, for our common experience seems at first sight to corroborate\nit entirely. Are not the sensations we get from the same object, for\nexample, always the same? Does not the same piano-key, struck with\nthe same force, make us hear in the same way? Does not the same grass\ngive us the same feeling of green, the same sky the same feeling of\nblue, and do we not get the same olfactory sensation no matter how many\ntimes we put our nose to the same flask of cologne? It seems a piece\nof metaphysical sophistry to suggest that we do not; and yet a close\nattention to the matter shows that _there is no proof that the same\nbodily sensation is ever got by us twice_.\n_What is got twice is the same_ OBJECT. We hear the same _note_ over\nand over again; we see the same _quality_ of green, or smell the same\nobjective perfume, or experience the same _species_ of pain. The\nrealities, concrete and abstract, physical and ideal, whose permanent\nexistence we believe in, seem to be constantly coming up again before\nour thought, and lead us, in our carelessness, to suppose that our\n'ideas' of them are the same ideas. When we come, some time later, to\nthe chapter on Perception, we shall see how inveterate is our habit\nof not attending to sensations as subjective facts, but of simply\nusing them as stepping-stones to pass over to the recognition of the\nrealities whose presence they reveal. The grass out of the window\nnow looks to me of the same green in the sun as in the shade, and\nyet a painter would have to paint one part of it dark brown, another\npart bright yellow, to give its real, sensational effect. We take\nno heed, as a rule, of the different way in which the same things\nlook and sound and smell at different distances and under different\ncircumstances. The sameness of the _things_ is what we are concerned\nto ascertain; and any sensations that assure us of that will probably\nbe considered in a rough way to be the same with each other. This\nis what makes off-hand testimony about the subjective identity of\ndifferent sensations well-nigh worthless as a proof of the fact. The\nentire history of Sensation is a commentary on our inability to tell\nwhether two sensations received apart are exactly alike. What appeals\nto our attention far more than the absolute quality or quantity of\na given sensation is its _ratio_ to whatever other sensations we may\nhave at the same time. When everything is dark a somewhat less dark\nsensation makes us see an object white. Helmholtz calculates that the\nwhite marble painted in a picture representing an architectural view by\nmoonlight is, when seen by daylight, from ten to twenty thousand times\nbrighter than the real moonlit marble would be.[222]\nSuch a difference as this could never have been _sensibly_ learned; it\nhad to be inferred from a series of indirect considerations. There are\nfacts which make us believe that our sensibility is altering all the\ntime, so that the same object cannot easily give us the same sensation\nover again. The eye's sensibility to light is at its maximum when the\neye is first exposed, and blunts itself with surprising rapidity.\nA long night's sleep will make it see things twice as brightly on\nwakening, as simple rest by closure will make it see them later in\nthe day.[223] We feel things differently according as we are sleepy\nor awake, hungry or full, fresh or tired; differently at night and\nin the morning, differently in summer and in winter, and above all\nthings differently in childhood, manhood, and old age. Yet we never\ndoubt that our feelings reveal the same world, with the same sensible\nqualities and the same sensible things occupying it. The difference\nof the sensibility is shown best by the difference of our emotion\nabout the things from one age to another, or when we are in different\norganic moods. What was bright and exciting becomes weary, flat, and\nunprofitable. The bird's song is tedious, the breeze is mournful, the\nsky is sad.\nTo these indirect presumptions that our sensations, following the\nmutations of our capacity for feeling, are always undergoing an\nessential change, must be added another presumption, based on what\nmust happen in the brain. Every sensation corresponds to some cerebral\naction. For an identical sensation to recur it would have to occur the\nsecond time _in an unmodified brain_. But as this, strictly speaking,\nis a physiological impossibility, so is an unmodified feeling an\nimpossibility; for to every brain-modification, however small, must\ncorrespond a change of equal amount in the feeling which the brain\nsubserves.\nAll this would be true if even sensations came to us pure and single\nand not combined into 'things.' Even then we should have to confess\nthat, however we might in ordinary conversation speak of getting the\nsame sensation again, we never in strict theoretic accuracy could do\nso; and that whatever was true of the river of life, of the river of\nelementary feeling, it would certainly be true to say, like Heraclitus,\nthat we never descend twice into the same stream.\nBut if the assumption of 'simple ideas of sensation' recurring in\nimmutable shape is so easily shown to be baseless, how much more\nbaseless is the assumption of immutability in the larger masses of our\nthought!\nFor there it is obvious and palpable that our state of mind is never\nprecisely the same. Every thought we have of a given fact is, strictly\nspeaking, unique, and only bears a resemblance of kind with our other\nthoughts of the same fact. When the identical fact recurs, we _must_\nthink of it in a fresh manner, see it under a somewhat different\nangle, apprehend it in different relations from those in which it\nlast appeared. And the thought by which we cognize it is the thought\nof it-in-those-relations, a thought suffused with the consciousness\nof all that dim context. Often we are ourselves struck at the strange\ndifferences in our successive views of the same thing. We wonder how\nwe ever could have opined as we did last month about a certain matter.\nWe have outgrown the possibility of that state of mind, we know not\nhow. From one year to another we see things in new lights. What was\nunreal has grown real, and what was exciting is insipid. The friends\nwe used to care the world for are shrunken to shadows; the women, once\nso divine, the stars, the woods, and the waters, how now so dull and\ncommon! the young girls that brought an aura of infinity, at present\nhardly distinguishable existences; pictures so empty; and as for the\nbooks, what _was_ there to find so mysteriously significant in Goethe,\nor in John Mill so full of weight? Instead of all this, more zestful\nthan ever is the work, the work; and fuller and deeper the import of\ncommon duties and of common goods.\nBut what here strikes us so forcibly on the flagrant scale exists on\nevery scale, down to the imperceptible transition from one hour's\noutlook to that of the next. Experience is remoulding us every moment,\nand our mental reaction on every given thing is really a resultant of\nour experience of the whole world up to that date. The analogies of\nbrain-physiology must again be appealed to to corroborate our view.\nOur earlier chapters have taught us to believe that, whilst we think,\nour brain changes, and that, like the aurora borealis, its whole\ninternal equilibrium shifts with every pulse of change. The precise\nnature of the shifting at a given moment is a product of many factors.\nThe accidental state of local nutrition or blood-supply may be among\nthem. But just as one of them certainly is the influence of outward\nobjects on the sense-organs during the moment, so is another certainly\nthe very special susceptibility in which the organ has been left at\nthat moment by all it has gone through in the past. Every brain-state\nis partly determined by the nature of this entire past succession.\nAlter the latter in any part, and the brain-state must be somewhat\ndifferent. Each present brain-state is a record in which the eye of\nOmniscience might read all the foregone history of its owner. It is out\nof the question, then, that any total brain-state should identically\nrecur. Something like it may recur; but to suppose _it_ to recur would\nbe equivalent to the absurd admission that all the states that had\nintervened between its two appearances had been pure nonentities, and\nthat the organ after their passage was exactly as it was before. And\n(to consider shorter periods) just as, in the senses, an impression\nfeels very differently according to what has preceded it; as one\ncolor succeeding another is modified by the contrast, silence sounds\ndelicious after noise, and a note, when the scale is sung up, sounds\nunlike itself when the scale is sung down; as the presence of certain\nlines in a figure changes the apparent form of the other lines, and as\nin music the whole \u00e6sthetic effect comes from the manner in which one\nset of sounds alters our feeling of another; so, in thought, we must\nadmit that those portions of the brain that have just been maximally\nexcited retain a kind of soreness which is a condition of our present\nconsciousness, a codeterminant of how and what we now shall feel.[224]\nEver some tracts are waning in tension, some waxing, whilst others\nactively discharge. The states of tension have as positive an influence\nas any in determining the total condition, and in deciding what the\n_psychosis_ shall be. All we know of submaximal nerve-irritations,\nand of the summation of apparently ineffective stimuli, tends to show\nthat _no_ changes in the brain are physiologically ineffective, and\nthat presumably none are bare of psychological result. But as the\nbrain-tension shifts from one relative state of equilibrium to another,\nlike the gyrations of a kaleidoscope, now rapid and now slow, is it\nlikely that its faithful psychic concomitant is heavier-footed than\nitself, and that it cannot match each one of the organ's irradiations\nby a shifting inward iridescence of its own? But if it can do this, its\ninward iridescences must be infinite, for the brain-redistributions are\nin infinite variety. If so coarse a thing as a telephone-plate can be\nmade to thrill for years and never reduplicate its inward condition,\nhow much more must this be the case with the infinitely delicate brain?\nI am sure that this concrete and total manner of regarding the mind's\nchanges is the only true manner, difficult as it may be to carry it out\nin detail. If anything seems obscure about it, it will grow clearer as\nwe advance. Meanwhile, if it be true, it is certainly also true that\nno two 'ideas' are ever exactly the same, which is the proposition we\nstarted to prove. The proposition is more important theoretically than\nit at first sight seems. For it makes it already impossible for us\nto follow obediently in the footprints of either the Lockian or the\nHerbartian school, schools which have had almost unlimited influence\nin Germany and among ourselves. No doubt it is often _convenient_ to\nformulate the mental facts in an atomistic sort of way, and to treat\nthe higher states of consciousness as if they were all built out of\nunchanging simple ideas. It is convenient often to treat curves as\nif they were composed of small straight lines, and electricity and\nnerve-force as if they were fluids. But in the one case as in the\nother we must never forget that we are talking symbolically, and that\nthere is nothing in nature to answer to our words. _A permanently\nexisting 'idea' or 'Vorstellung' which makes its appearance before the\nfootlights of consciousness at periodical intervals, is as mythological\nan entity as the Jack of Spades._\nWhat makes it convenient to use the mythological formulas is the whole\norganization of speech, which, as was remarked a while ago, was not\nmade by psychologists, but by men who were as a rule only interested\nin the facts their mental states revealed. They only spoke of their\nstates as _ideas of this or of that thing_. What wonder, then, that the\nthought is most easily conceived under the law of the thing whose name\nit bears! If the thing is composed of parts, then we suppose that the\nthought of the thing must be composed of the thoughts of the parts.\nIf one part of the thing have appeared in the same thing or in other\nthings on former occasions, why then we must be having even now the\nvery same 'idea' of that part which was there on those occasions. If\nthe thing is simple, its thought is simple. If it is multitudinous,\nit must require a multitude of thoughts to think it. If a succession,\nonly a succession of thoughts can know it. If permanent, its thought\nis permanent. And so on _ad libitum_. What after all is so natural\nas to assume that one object, called by one name, should be known\nby one affection of the mind? But, if language must thus influence\nus, the agglutinative languages, and even Greek and Latin with their\ndeclensions, would be the better guides. Names did not appear in them\ninalterable, but changed their shape to suit the context in which\nthey lay. It must have been easier then than now to conceive of the\nsame object as being thought of at different times in non-identical\nconscious states.\nThis, too, will grow clearer as we proceed. Meanwhile a necessary\nconsequence of the belief in permanent self-identical psychic facts\nthat absent themselves and recur periodically is the Humian doctrine\nthat our thought is composed of separate independent parts and is not a\nsensibly continuous stream. That this doctrine entirely misrepresents\nthe natural appearances is what I next shall try to show.\n3) _Within each personal consciousness, thought is sensibly continuous._\nI can only define 'continuous' as that which is without breach, crack,\nor division. I have already said that the breach from one mind to\nanother is perhaps the greatest breach in nature. The only breaches\nthat can well be conceived to occur within the limits of a single\nmind would either be _interruptions, time_-gaps during which the\nconsciousness went out altogether to come into existence again at a\nlater moment; or they would be breaks in the _quality_, or content, of\nthe thought, so abrupt that the segment that followed had no connection\nwhatever with the one that went before. The proposition that within\neach personal consciousness thought feels continuous, means two things:\n1. That even where there is a time-gap the consciousness after it feels\nas if it belonged together with the consciousness before it, as another\npart of the same self;\n2. That the changes from one moment to another in the quality of the\nconsciousness are never absolutely abrupt.\nThe case of the time-gaps, as the simplest, shall be taken first. And\nfirst of all a word about time-gaps of which the consciousness may not\nbe itself aware.\nOn page 200 we saw that such time-gaps existed, and that they might\nbe more numerous than is usually supposed. If the consciousness is\nnot aware of them, it cannot feel them as interruptions. In the\nunconsciousness produced by nitrous oxide and other an\u00e6sthetics, in\nthat of epilepsy and fainting, the broken edges of the sentient life\nmay meet and merge over the gap, much as the feelings of space of the\nopposite margins of the 'blind spot' meet and merge over that objective\ninterruption to the sensitiveness of the eye. Such consciousness as\nthis, whatever it be for the onlooking psychologist, is for itself\nunbroken. It _feels_ unbroken; a waking day of it is sensibly a unit\nas long as that day lasts, in the sense in which the hours themselves\nare units, as having all their parts next each other, with no intrusive\nalien substance between. To expect the consciousness to feel the\ninterruptions of its objective continuity as gaps, would be like\nexpecting the eye to feel a gap of silence because it does not hear, or\nthe ear to feel a gap of darkness because it does not see. So much for\nthe gaps that are unfelt.\nWith the felt gaps the case is different. On waking from sleep, we\nusually know that we have been unconscious, and we often have an\naccurate judgment of how long. The judgment here is certainly an\ninference from sensible signs, and its ease is due to long practice\nin the particular field.[225] The result of it, however, is that the\nconsciousness is, _for itself,_ not what it was in the former case, but\ninterrupted and discontinuous, in the mere sense of the words. But in\nthe other sense of continuity, the sense of the parts being inwardly\nconnected and belonging together because they are parts of a common\nwhole, the consciousness remains sensibly continuous and one. What now\nis the common whole? The natural name for it is _myself, I,_ or _me_.\nWhen Paul and Peter wake up in the same bed, and recognize that they\nhave been asleep, each one of them mentally reaches back and makes\nconnection with but _one_ of the two streams of thought which were\nbroken by the sleeping hours. As the current of an electrode buried\nin the ground unerringly finds its way to its own similarly buried\nmate, across no matter how much intervening earth; so Peter's present\ninstantly finds out Peter's past, and never by mistake knits itself\non to that of Paul. Paul's thought in turn is as little liable to\ngo astray. The past thought of Peter is appropriated by the present\nPeter alone. He may have a _knowledge_, and a correct one too, of\nwhat Paul's last drowsy states of mind were as he sank into sleep,\nbut it is an entirely different sort of knowledge from that which he\nhas of his own last states. He _remembers_ his own states, whilst\nhe only _conceives_ Paul's. Remembrance is like direct feeling; its\nobject is suffused with a warmth and intimacy to which no object of\nmere conception ever attains. This quality of warmth and intimacy and\nimmediacy is what Peter's _present_ thought also possesses for itself.\nSo sure as this present is me, is mine, it says, so sure is anything\nelse that comes with the same warmth and intimacy and immediacy, me and\nmine. What the qualities called warmth and intimacy may in themselves\nbe will have to be matter for future consideration. But whatever past\nfeelings appear with those qualities must be admitted to receive the\ngreeting of the present mental state, to be owned by it, and accepted\nas belonging together with it in a common self. This community of\nself is what the time-gap cannot break in twain, and is why a present\nthought, although not ignorant of the time-gap, can still regard itself\nas continuous with certain chosen portions of the past.\nConsciousness, then, does not appear to itself chopped up in bits. Such\nwords as 'chain' or 'train' do not describe it fitly as it presents\nitself in the first instance. It is nothing jointed; it flows. A\n'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally\ndescribed. _In talking of it hereafter, let us call it the stream of\nthought, of consciousness, or of subjective life._\n*       *       *       *       *\nBut now there appears, even within the limits of the same self, and\nbetween thoughts all of which alike have this same sense of belonging\ntogether, a kind of jointing and separateness among the parts, of which\nthis statement seems to take no account. I refer to the breaks that\nare produced by sudden _contrasts in the quality_ of the successive\nsegments of the stream of thought If the words 'chain' and 'train' had\nno natural fitness in them, how came such words to be used at all? Does\nnot a loud explosion rend the consciousness upon which it abruptly\nbreaks, in twain? Does not every sudden shock, appearance of a new\nobject, or change in a sensation, create a real interruption, sensibly\nfelt as such, which cuts the conscious stream across at the moment at\nwhich it appears? Do not such interruptions smite us every hour of our\nlives, and have we the right, in their presence, still to call our\nconsciousness a continuous stream?\nThis objection is based partly on a confusion and partly on a\nsuperficial introspective view.\nThe confusion is between the thoughts themselves, taken as subjective\nfacts, and the things of which they are aware. It is natural to make\nthis confusion, but easy to avoid it when once put on one's guard.\nThe things are discrete and discontinuous; they do pass before us in\na train or chain, making often explosive appearances and rending each\nother in twain. But their comings and goings and contrasts no more\nbreak the flow of the thought that thinks them than they break the\ntime and the space in which they lie. A silence may be broken by a\nthunder-clap, and we may be so stunned and confused for a moment by the\nshock as to give no instant account to ourselves of what has happened.\nBut that very confusion is a mental state, and a state that passes us\nstraight over from the silence to the sound. The transition between the\nthought of one object and the thought of another is no more a break in\nthe _thought_ than a joint in a bamboo is a break in the wood. It is\na part of the _consciousness_ as much as the joint is a part of the\n_bamboo_.\nThe superficial introspective view is the overlooking, even when\nthe things are contrasted with each other most violently, of the\nlarge amount of affinity that may still remain between the thoughts\nby whose means they are cognized. Into the awareness of the thunder\nitself the awareness of the previous silence creeps and continues;\nfor what we hear when the thunder crashes is not thunder _pure_,\nbut thunder-breaking-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it.[226] Our\nfeeling of the same objective thunder, coming in this way, is quite\ndifferent from what it would be were the thunder a continuation of\nprevious thunder. The thunder itself we believe to abolish and exclude\nthe silence; but the _feeling_ of the thunder is also a feeling of\nthe silence as just gone; and it would be difficult to find in the\nactual concrete consciousness of man a feeling so limited to the\npresent as not to have an inkling of anything that went before. Here,\nagain, language works against our perception of the truth. We name our\nthoughts simply, each after its thing, as if each knew its own thing\nand nothing else. What each really knows is clearly the thing it is\nnamed for, with dimly perhaps a thousand other things. It ought to\nbe named after all of them, but it never is. Some of them are always\nthings known a moment ago more clearly; others are things to be known\nmore clearly a moment hence.[227] Our own bodily position, attitude,\ncondition, is one of the things of which _some_ awareness, however\ninattentive, invariably accompanies the knowledge of whatever else\nwe know. We think; and as we think we feel our bodily selves as the\nseat of the thinking. If the thinking be _our_ thinking, it must be\nsuffused through all its parts with that peculiar warmth and intimacy\nthat make it come as ours. Whether the warmth and intimacy be anything\nmore than the feeling of the same old body always there, is a matter\nfor the next chapter to decide. _Whatever_ the content of the ego may\nbe, it is habitually felt _with_ everything else by us humans, and must\nform a _liaison_ between all the things of which we become successively\naware.[228]\nOn this gradualness in the changes of our mental content the principles\nof nerve-action can throw some more light. When studying, in Chapter\nIII, the summation of nervous activities, we saw that no state of the\nbrain can be supposed instantly to die away. If a new state comes, the\ninertia of the old state will still be there and modify the result\naccordingly. Of course we cannot tell, in our ignorance, what in each\ninstance the modifications ought to be. The commonest modifications\nin sense-perception are known as the phenomena of contrast. In\n\u00e6sthetics they are the feelings of delight or displeasure which certain\nparticular orders in a series of impressions give. In thought, strictly\nand narrowly so called, they are unquestionably that consciousness of\nthe _whence_ and the _whither_ that always accompanies its flows. If\nrecently the brain-tract _a_ was vividly excited, and then _b_, and now\nvividly _c_, the total present consciousness is not produced simply\nby _c_'s excitement, but also by the dying vibrations of _a_ and _b_\nas well. If we want to represent the brain-process we must write it\nthus: __{a}b^{c}_--three different processes coexisting, and correlated\nwith them a thought which is no one of the three thoughts which they\nwould have produced had each of them occurred alone. But whatever this\nfourth thought may exactly be, it seems impossible that it should not\nbe something _like_ each of the three other thoughts whose tracts are\nconcerned in its production, though in a fast-waning phase.\nIt all goes back to what we said in another connection only a few\npages ago (p. 233). As the total neurosis changes, so does the total\npsychosis change. But as the changes of neurosis are never absolutely\ndiscontinuous, so must the successive psychoses shade gradually into\neach other, although their _rate_ of change may be much faster at one\nmoment than at the next.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThis difference in the rate of change lies at the basis of a difference\nof subjective states of which we ought immediately to speak. When\nthe rate is slow we are aware of the object of our thought in a\ncomparatively restful and stable way. When rapid, we are aware of\na passage, a relation, a transition _from_ it, or _between_ it and\nsomething else. As we take, in fact, a general view of the wonderful\nstream of our consciousness, what strikes us first is this different\npace of its parts. Like a bird's life, it seems to be made of an\nalternation of flights and perchings. The rhythm of language expresses\nthis, where every thought is expressed in a sentence, and every\nsentence closed by a period. The resting-places are usually occupied\nby sensorial imaginations of some sort, whose peculiarity is that they\ncan be held before the mind for an indefinite time, and contemplated\nwithout changing; the places of flight are filled with thoughts of\nrelations, static or dynamic, that for the most part obtain between the\nmatters contemplated in the periods of comparative rest.\n_Let us call the resting-places the 'substantive parts,' and the\nplaces of flight the 'transitive parts,' of the stream of thought._\nIt then appears that the main end of our thinking is at all times the\nattainment of some other substantive part than the one from which we\nhave just been dislodged. And we may say that the main use of the\ntransitive parts is to lead us from one substantive conclusion to\nanother.\nNow it is very difficult, introspectively, to see the transitive parts\nfor what they really are. If they are but flights to a conclusion,\nstopping them to look at them before the conclusion is reached is\nreally annihilating them. Whilst if we wait till the conclusion _be_\nreached, it so exceeds them in vigor and stability that it quite\neclipses and swallows them up in its glare. Let anyone try to cut a\nthought across in the middle and get a look at its section, and he\nwill see how difficult the introspective observation of the transitive\ntracts is. The rush of the thought is so headlong that it almost\nalways brings us up at the conclusion before we can arrest it. Or if\nour purpose is nimble enough and we do arrest it, it ceases forthwith\nto be itself. As a snow-flake crystal caught in the warm hand is no\nlonger a crystal but a drop, so, instead of catching the feeling of\nrelation moving to its term, we find we have caught some substantive\nthing, usually the last word we were pronouncing, statically taken, and\nwith its function, tendency, and particular meaning in the sentence\nquite evaporated. The attempt at introspective analysis in these cases\nis in fact like seizing a spinning top to catch its motion, or trying\nto turn up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks. And\nthe challenge to _produce_ these psychoses, which is sure to be thrown\nby doubting psychologists at anyone who contends for their existence,\nis as unfair as Zeno's treatment of the advocates of motion, when,\nasking them to point out in what place an arrow _is_ when it moves, he\nargues the falsity of their thesis from their inability to make to so\npreposterous a question an immediate reply.\nThe results of this introspective difficulty are baleful. If to hold\nfast and observe the transitive parts of thought's stream be so\nhard, then the great blunder to which all schools are liable must be\nthe failure to register them, and the undue emphasizing of the more\nsubstantive parts of the stream. Were we not ourselves a moment since\nin danger of ignoring any feeling transitive between the silence and\nthe thunder, and of treating their boundary as a sort of break in\nthe mind? Now such ignoring as this has historically worked in two\nways. One set of thinkers have been led by it to _Sensationalism_.\nUnable to lay their hands on any coarse feelings corresponding to\nthe innumerable relations and forms of connection between the facts\nof the world, finding no _named_ subjective modifications mirroring\nsuch relations, they have for the most part denied that feelings of\nrelation exist, and many of them, like Hume, have gone so far as to\ndeny the reality of most relations _out_ of the mind as well as in it.\nSubstantive psychoses, sensations and their copies and derivatives,\njuxtaposed like dominoes in a game, but really separate, everything\nelse verbal illusion,--such is the upshot of this view.[229] The\n_Intellectualists_, on the other hand, unable to give up the reality\nof relations _extra mentem_, but equally unable to point to any\ndistinct substantive feelings in which they were known, have made the\nsame admission that the feelings do not exist. But they have drawn\nan opposite conclusion. The relations must be known, they say, in\nsomething that is no feeling, no mental modification continuous and\nconsubstantial with the subjective tissue out of which sensations and\nother substantive states are made. They are known, these relations,\nby something that lies on an entirely different plane, by an _actus\npurus_ of Thought, Intellect, or Reason, all written with capitals\nand considered to mean something unutterably superior to any fact of\nsensibility whatever.\nBut from our point of view both Intellectualists and Sensationalists\nare wrong. If there be such things as feelings at all, _then so surely\nas relations between objects exist in rerum natur\u00e2, so surely, and more\nsurely, do feelings exist to which these relations are known_. There\nis not a conjunction or a preposition, and hardly an adverbial phrase,\nsyntactic form, or inflection of voice, in human speech, that does\nnot express some shading or other of relation which we at some moment\nactually feel to exist between the larger objects of our thought. If we\nspeak objectively, it is the real relations that appear revealed; if we\nspeak subjectively, it is the stream of consciousness that matches each\nof them by an inward coloring of its own. In either case the relations\nare numberless, and no existing language is capable of doing justice to\nall their shades.\nWe ought to say a feeling of _and_, a feeling of _if_, a feeling of\n_but_, and a feeling of _by_, quite as readily as we say a feeling of\n_blue_ or a feeling of _cold_. Yet we do not: so inveterate has our\nhabit become of recognizing the existence of the substantive parts\nalone, that language almost refuses to lend itself to any other use.\nThe Empiricists have always dwelt on its influence in making us suppose\nthat where we have a separate name, a separate thing must needs be\nthere to correspond with it; and they have rightly denied the existence\nof the mob of abstract entities, principles, and forces, in whose favor\nno other evidence than this could be brought up. But they have said\nnothing of that obverse error, of which we said a word in Chapter VII,\n(see p. 195), of supposing that where there is _no_ name no entity\ncan exist. All _dumb_ or anonymous psychic states have, owing to this\nerror, been coolly suppressed; or, if recognized at all, have been\nnamed after the substantive perception they led to, as thoughts 'about'\nthis object or 'about' that, the stolid word _about_ engulfing all\ntheir delicate idiosyncrasies in its monotonous sound. Thus the greater\nand greater accentuation and isolation of the substantive parts have\ncontinually gone on.\nOnce more take a look at the brain. We believe the brain to be an organ\nwhose internal equilibrium is always in a state of change,--the change\naffecting every part. The pulses of change are doubtless more violent\nin one place than in another, their rhythm more rapid at this time than\nat that. As in a kaleidoscope revolving at a uniform rate, although\nthe figures are always rearranging themselves, there are instants\nduring which the transformation seems minute and interstitial and\nalmost absent, followed by others when it shoots with magical rapidity,\nrelatively stable forms thus alternating with forms we should not\ndistinguish if seen again; so in the brain the perpetual rearrangement\nmust result in some forms of tension lingering relatively long, whilst\nothers simply come and pass. But if consciousness corresponds to the\nfact of rearrangement itself, why, if the rearrangement stop not,\nshould the consciousness ever cease? And if a lingering rearrangement\nbrings with it one kind of consciousness, why should not a swift\nrearrangement bring another kind of consciousness as peculiar as the\nrearrangement itself? The lingering consciousnesses, if of simple\nobjects, we call 'sensations' or 'images,' according as they are vivid\nor faint; if of complex objects, we call them 'percepts' when vivid,\n'concepts' or 'thoughts' when faint. For the swift consciousnesses\nwe have only those names of 'transitive states,' or 'feelings of\nrelation,' which we have used.[230] As the brain-changes are\ncontinuous, so do all these consciousnesses melt into each other like\ndissolving views. Properly they are but one protracted consciousness,\none unbroken stream.\n_Feelings of Tendency._\nSo much for the transitive states. But there are other unnamed states\nor qualities of states that are just as important and just as\ncognitive as they, and just as much unrecognized by the traditional\nsensationalist and intellectualist philosophies of mind. The first\nfails to find them at all, the second finds their _cognitive function_,\nbut denies that anything in the way of _feeling_ has a share in\nbringing it about. Examples will make clear what these inarticulate\npsychoses, due to waxing and waning excitements of the brain, are\nlike.[231]\nSuppose three successive persons say to us: 'Wait!' 'Hark!' 'Look!'\nOur consciousness is thrown into three quite different attitudes of\nexpectancy, although no definite object is before it in any one of\nthe three cases. Leaving out different actual bodily attitudes, and\nleaving out the reverberating images of the three words, which are of\ncourse diverse, probably no one will deny the existence of a residual\nconscious affection, a sense of the direction from which an impression\nis about to come, although no positive impression is yet there.\nMeanwhile we have no names for the psychoses in question but the names\nhark, look, and wait.\nSuppose we try to recall a forgotten name. The state of our\nconsciousness is peculiar. There is a gap therein; but no mere gap.\nIt is a gap that is intensely active. A sort of wraith of the name\nis in it, beckoning us in a given direction, making us at moments\ntingle with the sense of our closeness, and then letting us sink back\nwithout the longed-for term. If wrong names are proposed to us, this\nsingularly definite gap acts immediately so as to negate them. They do\nnot fit into its mould. And the gap of one word does not feel like the\ngap of another, all empty of content as both might seem necessarily\nto be when described as gaps. When I vainly try to recall the name of\nSpalding, my consciousness is far removed from what it is when I vainly\ntry to recall the name of Bowles. Here some ingenious persons will\nsay: \"How _can_ the two consciousnesses be different when the terms\nwhich might make them different are not there? All that is there, so\nlong as the effort to recall is vain, is the bare effort itself. How\nshould that differ in the two cases? You are making it seem to differ\nby prematurely filling it out with the different names, although\nthese, by the hypothesis, have not yet come. Stick to the two efforts\nas they are, without naming them after facts not yet existent, and\nyou'll be quite unable to designate any point in which they differ.\"\nDesignate, truly enough. We can only designate the difference by\nborrowing the names of objects not yet in the mind. Which is to say\nthat our psychological vocabulary is wholly inadequate to name the\ndifferences that exist, even such strong differences as these. But\nnamelessness is compatible with existence. There are innumerable\nconsciousnesses of emptiness, no one of which taken in itself has a\nname, but all different from each other. The ordinary way is to assume\nthat they are all emptinesses of consciousness, and so the same state.\nBut the feeling of an absence is _toto c\u0153lo_ other than the absence\nof a feeling. It is an intense feeling. The rhythm of a lost word may\nbe there without a sound to clothe it; or the evanescent sense of\nsomething which is the initial vowel or consonant may mock us fitfully,\nwithout growing more distinct. Every one must know the tantalizing\neffect of the blank rhythm of some forgotten verse, restlessly dancing\nin one's mind, striving to be filled out with words.\nAgain, what is the strange difference between an experience tasted\nfor the first time and the same experience recognized as familiar,\nas having been enjoyed before, though we cannot name it or say where\nor when? A tune, an odor, a flavor sometimes carry this inarticulate\nfeeling of their familiarity so deep into our consciousness that\nwe are fairly shaken by its mysterious emotional power. But strong\nand characteristic as this psychosis is--it probably is due to the\nsubmaximal excitement of wide-spreading associational brain-tracts--the\nonly name we have for all its shadings is 'sense of familiarity.'\nWhen we read such phrases as 'naught but,' 'either one or the other,'\n'_a_ is _b_, but,' 'although it is, nevertheless,' 'it is an excluded\nmiddle, there is no _tertium quid_,' and a host of other verbal\nskeletons of logical relation, is it true that there is nothing more\nin our minds than the words themselves as they pass? What then is\nthe meaning of the words which we think we understand as we read?\nWhat makes that meaning different in one phrase from what it is in\nthe other? 'Who?' 'When?' 'Where?' Is the difference of felt meaning\nin these interrogatives nothing more than their difference of sound?\nAnd is it not (just like the difference of sound itself) known and\nunderstood in an affection of consciousness correlative to it, though\nso impalpable to direct examination? Is not the same true of such\nnegatives as 'no,' 'never,' 'not yet'?\nThe truth is that large tracts of human speech are nothing but _signs\nof direction_ in thought, of which direction we nevertheless have an\nacutely discriminative sense, though no definite sensorial image plays\nany part in it whatsoever. Sensorial images are stable psychic facts;\nwe can hold them still and look at them as long as we like. These bare\nimages of logical movement, on the contrary, are psychic transitions,\nalways on the wing, so to speak, and not to be glimpsed except in\nflight. Their function is to lead from one set of images to another.\nAs they pass, we feel both the waxing and the waning images in a way\naltogether peculiar and a way quite different from the way of their\nfull presence. If we try to hold fast the feeling of direction, the\nfull presence comes and the feeling of direction is lost. The blank\nverbal scheme of the logical movement gives us the fleeting sense of\nthe movement as we read it, quite as well as does a rational sentence\nawakening definite imaginations by its words.\nWhat is that first instantaneous glimpse of some one's meaning which we\nhave, when in vulgar phrase we say we 'twig' it? Surely an altogether\nspecific affection of our mind. And has the reader never asked himself\nwhat kind of a mental fact is his _intention of saying a thing_ before\nhe has said it? It is an entirely definite intention, distinct from\nall other intentions, an absolutely distinct state of consciousness,\ntherefore; and yet how much of it consists of definite sensorial\nimages, either of words or of things? Hardly anything! Linger, and\nthe words and things come into the mind; the anticipatory intention,\nthe divination is there no more. But as the words that replace it\narrive, it welcomes them successively and calls them right if they\nagree with it, it rejects them and calls them wrong if they do not.\nIt has therefore a nature of its own of the most positive sort, and\nyet what can we say about it without using words that belong to the\nlater mental facts that replace it? The intention _to-say-so-and-so_\nis the only name it can receive. One may admit that a good third of\nour psychic life consists in these rapid premonitory perspective views\nof schemes of thought not yet articulate. How comes it about that a\nman reading something aloud for the first time is able immediately to\nemphasize all his words aright, unless from the very first he have a\nsense of at least the form of the sentence yet to come, which sense\nis fused with his consciousness of the present word, and modifies its\nemphasis in his mind so as to make him give it the proper accent as\nhe utters it? Emphasis of this kind is almost altogether a matter of\ngrammatical construction. If we read 'no more' we expect presently to\ncome upon a 'than'; if we read 'however' at the outset of a sentence\nit is a 'yet,' a 'still,' or a 'nevertheless,' that we expect. A noun\nin a certain position demands a verb in a certain mood and number, in\nanother position it expects a relative pronoun. Adjectives call for\nnouns, verbs for adverbs, etc., etc. And this foreboding of the coming\ngrammatical scheme combined with each successive uttered word is so\npractically accurate that a reader incapable of understanding four\nideas of the book he is reading aloud, can nevertheless read it with\nthe most delicately modulated expression of intelligence.\nSome will interpret these facts by calling them all cases in which\ncertain images, by laws of association, awaken others so very rapidly\nthat we think afterwards we felt the very _tendencies_ of the nascent\nimages to arise, before they were actually there. For this school the\nonly possible materials of consciousness are images of a perfectly\ndefinite nature. Tendencies exist, but they are facts for the outside\npsychologist rather than for the subject of the observation. The\ntendency is thus a _psychical_ zero; only its _results_ are felt.\nNow what I contend for, and accumulate examples to show, is that\n'tendencies' are not only descriptions from without, but that they are\namong the _objects_ of the stream, which is thus aware of them from\nwithin, and must be described as in very large measure constituted of\n_feelings_ of _tendency_, often so vague that we are unable to name\nthem at all. It is, in short, the re-instatement of the vague to its\nproper place in our mental life which I am so anxious to press on the\nattention. Mr. Galton and Prof. Huxley have, as we shall see in Chapter\nXVIII, made one step in advance in exploding the ridiculous theory of\nHume and Berkeley that we can have no images but of perfectly definite\nthings. Another is made in the overthrow of the equally ridiculous\nnotion that, whilst simple objective qualities are revealed to our\nknowledge in subjective feelings, relations are not. But these reforms\nare not half sweeping and radical enough. What must be admitted is\nthat the definite images of traditional psychology form but the very\nsmallest part of our minds as they actually live. The traditional\npsychology talks like one who should say a river consists of nothing\nbut pailsful, spoonsful, quartpotsful, barrelsful, and other moulded\nforms of water. Even were the pails and the pots all actually standing\nin the stream, still between them the free water would continue to\nflow. It is just this free water of consciousness that psychologists\nresolutely overlook. Every definite image in the mind is steeped and\ndyed in the free water that flows round it. With it goes the sense of\nits relations, near and remote, the dying echo of whence it came to\nus, the dawning sense of whither it is to lead. The significance, the\nvalue, of the image is all in this halo or penumbra that surrounds and\nescorts it,--or rather that is fused into one with it and has become\nbone of its bone and flesh of its flesh; leaving it, it is true, an\nimage of the same _thing_ it was before, but making it an image of that\nthing newly taken and freshly understood.\nWhat is that shadowy scheme of the 'form' of an opera, play, or book,\nwhich remains in our mind and on which we pass judgment when the actual\nthing is done? What is our notion of a scientific or philosophical\nsystem? Great thinkers have vast premonitory glimpses of schemes of\nrelation between terms, which hardly even as verbal images enter\nthe mind, so rapid is the whole process.[232] We all of us have\nthis permanent consciousness of whither our thought is going. It is\na feeling like any other, a feeling of what thoughts are next to\narise, before they have arisen. This field of view of consciousness\nvaries very much in extent, depending largely on the degree of mental\nfreshness or fatigue. When very fresh, our minds carry an immense\nhorizon with them. The present image shoots its perspective far before\nit, irradiating in advance the regions in which lie the thoughts as\nyet unborn. Under ordinary conditions the halo of felt relations is\nmuch more circumscribed. And in states of extreme brain-fag the horizon\nis narrowed almost to the passing word,--the associative machinery,\nhowever, providing for the next word turning up in orderly sequence,\nuntil at last the tired thinker is led to some kind of a conclusion. At\ncertain moments he may find himself doubting whether his thoughts have\nnot come to a full stop; but the vague sense of a _plus ultra_ makes\nhim ever struggle on towards a more definite expression of what it may\nbe; whilst the slowness of his utterance shows how difficult, under\nsuch conditions, the labor of thinking must be.\nThe awareness that our _definite_ thought has come to a stop is an\nentirely different thing from the awareness that our thought is\ndefinitively completed. The expression of the latter state of mind is\nthe falling inflection which betokens that the sentence is ended, and\nsilence. The expression of the former state is 'hemming and hawing,' or\nelse such phrases as '_et cetera_,' or 'and so forth.' But notice that\nevery part of the sentence to be left incomplete feels differently as\nit passes, by reason of the premonition we have that we shall be unable\nto end it. The 'and so forth' casts its shadow back, and is as integral\na part of the object of the thought as the distinctest of images would\nbe.\nAgain, when we use a common noun, such as _man_, in a universal sense,\nas signifying all possible men, we are fully aware of this intention\non our part, and distinguish it carefully from our intention when we\nmean a certain group of men, or a solitary individual before us. In the\nchapter on Conception we shall see how important this difference of\nintention is. It casts its influence over the whole of the sentence,\nboth before and after the spot in which the word _man_ is used.\nNothing is easier than to symbolize all these facts in terms of\nbrain-action. Just as the echo of the _whence_, the sense of the\nstarting point of our thought, is probably due to the dying excitement\nof processes but a moment since vividly aroused; so the sense of the\nwhither, the foretaste of the terminus, must be due to the waxing\nexcitement of tracts or processes which, a moment hence, will be the\ncerebral correlatives of some thing which a moment hence will be\nvividly present to the thought. Represented by a curve, the neurosis\nunderlying consciousness must at any moment be like this:\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\nEach point of the horizontal line stands for some brain-tract or\nprocess. The height of the curve above the line stands for the\nintensity of the process. All the processes are _present_, in the\nintensities shown by the curve. But those before the latter's apex\n_were_ more intense a moment ago; those after it _will be_ more intense\na moment hence. If I recite _a, b, c, d, e, f, g,_ at the moment\nof uttering _d_, neither _a, b, c,_ nor _e, f, g,_ are out of my\nconsciousness altogether, but both, after their respective fashions,\n'mix their dim lights' with the stronger one of the _d_, because their\nneuroses are both awake in some degree.\nThere is a common class of mistakes which shows how brain-processes\nbegin to be excited before the thoughts attached to them are\n_due_--due, that is, in substantive and vivid form. I mean those\nmistakes of speech or writing by which, in Dr. Carpenter's words, \"we\nmispronounce or misspell a word, by introducing into it a letter or\nsyllable of some other, whose turn is shortly to come; or, it may be,\nthe whole of the anticipated word is substituted for the one which\nought to have been expressed.\"[233] In these cases one of two things\nmust have happened: either some local accident of nutrition _blocks_\nthe process that is _due_, so that other processes discharge that ought\nas yet to be but nascently aroused; or some opposite local accident\n_furthers_ the _latter processes_ and makes them explode before their\ntime. In the chapter on Association of Ideas, numerous instances will\ncome before us of the actual effect on consciousness of neuroses not\nyet maximally aroused.\nIt is just like the 'overtones' in music. Different instruments give\nthe 'same note,' but each in a different voice, because each gives more\nthan that note, namely, various upper harmonics of it which differ from\none instrument to another. They are not separately heard by the ear;\nthey blend with the fundamental note, and suffuse it, and alter it; and\neven so do the waxing and waning brain-processes at every moment blend\nwith and suffuse and alter the psychic effect of the processes which\nare at their culminating point.\n*       *       *       *       *\nLet us use the words _psychic overtone, suffusion,_ or _fringe_, to\ndesignate the influence of a faint brain-process upon our thought, as\nit makes it aware of relations and objects but dimly perceived.[234]\nIf we then consider the _cognitive function_ of different states of\nmind, we may feel assured that the difference between those that are\nmere 'acquaintance,' and those that are 'knowledges-_about_' (see p.\n221) is reducible almost entirely to the absence or presence of psychic\nfringes or overtones. Knowledge _about_ a thing is knowledge of its\nrelations. Acquaintance with it is limitation to the bare impression\nwhich it makes. Of most of its relations we are only aware in the\npenumbral nascent way of a 'fringe' of unarticulated affinities about\nit. And, before passing to the next topic in order, I must say a little\nof this sense of affinity, as itself one of the most interesting\nfeatures of the subjective stream.\nIn all our voluntary thinking there is some topic or subject about\nwhich all the members of the thought revolve. Half the time this\ntopic is a problem, a gap we cannot yet fill with a definite picture,\nword, or phrase, but which, in the manner described some time back,\ninfluences us in an intensely active and determinate psychic way.\nWhatever may be the images and phrases that pass before us, we feel\ntheir relation to this aching gap. To fill it up is our thoughts'\ndestiny. Some bring us nearer to that consummation. Some the gap\nnegates as quite irrelevant. Each swims in a felt fringe of relations\nof which the aforesaid gap is the term. Or instead of a definite gap\nwe may merely carry a mood of interest about with us. Then, however\nvague the mood, it will still act in the same way, throwing a mantle of\nfelt affinity over such representations, entering the mind, as suit it,\nand tingeing with the feeling of tediousness or discord all those with\nwhich it has no concern.\nRelation, then, to our topic or interest is constantly felt in the\nfringe, and particularly the relation of harmony and discord, of\nfurtherance or hindrance of the topic. When the sense of furtherance\nis there, we are 'all right;' with the sense of hindrance we are\ndissatisfied and perplexed, and cast about us for other thoughts. Now\n_any_ thought the quality of whose fringe lets us feel ourselves 'all\nright,' is an acceptable member of our thinking, whatever kind of\nthought it may otherwise be. Provided we only feel it to have a place\nin the scheme of relations in which the interesting topic also lies,\nthat is quite sufficient to make of it a relevant and appropriate\nportion of our train of ideas.\n_For the important thing about a train of thought is its conclusion._\nThat is the _meaning_, or, as we say, the topic of the thought. That is\nwhat abides when all its other members have faded from memory. Usually\nthis conclusion is a word or phrase or particular image, or practical\nattitude or resolve, whether rising to answer a problem or fill a\npre-existing gap that worried us, or whether accidentally stumbled on\nin revery. In either case it stands out from the other segments of\nthe stream by reason of the peculiar interest attaching to it. This\ninterest _arrests_ it, makes a sort of crisis of it when it comes,\ninduces attention upon it and makes us treat it in a substantive way.\nThe parts of the stream that precede these substantive conclusions\nare but the means of the latter's attainment. And, provided the same\nconclusion be reached, the means may be as mutable as we like, for the\n'meaning' of the stream of thought will be the same. What difference\ndoes it make what the means are? \"_Qu'importe le flacon, pourvu qu'on\nait l'ivresse?_\" The relative unimportance of the means appears from\nthe fact that when the conclusion is there, we have always forgotten\nmost of the steps preceding its attainment. When we have uttered a\nproposition, we are rarely able a moment afterwards to recall our exact\nwords, though we can express it in different words easily enough. The\npractical upshot of a book we read remains with us, though we may not\nrecall one of its sentences.\nThe only paradox would seem to lie in supposing that the fringe of\nfelt affinity and discord can be the same in two heterogeneous sets of\nimages. Take a train of words passing through the mind and leading to\na certain conclusion on the one hand, and on the other hand an almost\nwordless set of tactile, visual and other fancies leading to the same\nconclusion. Can the halo, fringe, or scheme in which we feel the words\nto lie be the same as that in which we feel the images to lie? Does not\nthe discrepancy of terms involve a discrepancy of felt relations among\nthem?\nIf the terms be taken _qu\u00e2_ mere sensations, it assuredly does. For\ninstance, the words may rhyme with each other,--the visual images can\nhave no such affinity as _that_. But _qu\u00e2_ thoughts, _qu\u00e2_ sensations\n_understood_, the words have contracted by long association fringes of\nmutual repugnance or affinity with each other and with the conclusion,\nwhich run exactly parallel with like fringes in the visual, tactile\nand other ideas. The most important element of these fringes is, I\nrepeat, the mere feeling of harmony or discord, of a right or wrong\ndirection in the thought. Dr. Campbell has, so far as I know, made the\nbest analysis of this fact, and his words, often quoted, deserve to be\nquoted again. The chapter is entitled \"What is the cause that nonsense\nso often escapes being detected, both by the writer and by the reader?\"\nThe author, in answering this question, makes (_inter alia_) the\nfollowing remarks:[235]\n\"That connection [he says] or relation which comes gradually to\nsubsist among the different words of a language, in the minds of those\nwho speak it,... is merely consequent on this, that those words are\nemployed as signs of connected or related things. It is an axiom in\ngeometry that things equal to the same thing are equal to one another.\nIt may, in like manner, be admitted as an axiom in psychology that\nideas associated by the same idea will associate one another. Hence it\nwill happen that if, from experiencing the connection of two things,\nthere results, as infallibly there will result, an association between\nthe ideas or notions annexed to them, as each idea will moreover be\nassociated by its sign, there will likewise be an association between\nthe ideas of the signs. Hence the sounds considered as signs will be\nconceived to have a connection analogous to that which subsisteth\namong the things signified; I say, the sounds considered as signs;\nfor this way of considering them constantly attends us in speaking,\nwriting, hearing, and reading. When we purposely abstract from it,\nand regard them merely as sounds, we are instantly sensible that they\nare quite unconnected, and have no other relation than what ariseth\nfrom similitude of tone or accent. But to consider them in this manner\ncommonly results from previous design, and requires a kind of effort\nwhich is not exerted in the ordinary use of speech. In ordinary use\nthey are regarded solely as signs, or, rather, they are confounded\nwith the things they signify; the consequence of which is that, in the\nmanner just now explained, we come insensibly to conceive a connection\namong them of a very different sort from that of which sounds are\nnaturally susceptible.\n\"Now this conception, habit, or tendency of the mind, call it which\nyou please, is considerably strengthened by the frequent use of\nlanguage and by the structure of it. Language is the sole channel\nthrough which we communicate our knowledge and discoveries to\nothers, and through which the knowledge and discoveries of others\nare communicated to us. By reiterated recourse to this medium, it\nnecessarily happens that when things are related to each other, the\nwords signifying those things are more commonly brought together in\ndiscourse. Hence the words and names by themselves, by customary\nvicinity, contract in the fancy a relation additional to that which\nthey derive purely from being the symbols of related things. Farther,\nthis tendency is strengthened by the structure of language. All\nlanguages whatever, even the most barbarous, as far as hath yet\nappeared, are of a regular and analogical make. The consequence is\nthat similar relations in things will be expressed similarly; that\nis, by similar inflections, derivations, compositions, arrangement\nof words, or juxtaposition of particles, according to the genius or\ngrammatical form of the particular tongue. Now as, by the habitual use\nof a language (even though it were quite irregular), the signs would\ninsensibly become connected in the imagination wherever the things\nsignified are connected in nature, so, by the regular structure of a\nlanguage, this connection among the signs is conceived as analogous to\nthat which subsisteth among their archetypes.\"\nIf we know English and French and begin a sentence in French, all the\nlater words that come are French; we hardly ever drop into English.\nAnd this affinity of the French words for each other is not something\nmerely operating mechanically as a brain-law, it is something we feel\nat the time. Our understanding of a French sentence heard never falls\nto so low an ebb that we are not aware that the words linguistically\nbelong together. Our attention can hardly so wander that if an English\nword be suddenly introduced we shall not start at the change. Such\na vague sense as this of the words belonging together is the very\nminimum of fringe that can accompany them, if 'thought' at all. Usually\nthe vague perception that all the words we hear belong to the same\nlanguage and to the same special vocabulary in that language, and that\nthe grammatical sequence is familiar, is practically equivalent to an\nadmission that what we hear is sense. But if an unusual foreign word\nbe introduced, if the grammar trip, or if a term from an incongruous\nvocabulary suddenly appear, such as 'rat-trap' or 'plumber's bill' in a\nphilosophical discourse, the sentence detonates, as it were, we receive\na shock from the incongruity, and the drowsy assent is gone. The\nfeeling of rationality in these cases seems rather a negative than a\npositive thing, being the mere absence of shock, or sense of discord,\nbetween the terms of thought.\nSo delicate and incessant is this recognition by the mind of the\nmere fitness of words to be mentioned together that the slightest\nmisreading, such as 'casualty' for 'causality,' or 'perpetual' for\n'perceptual,' will be corrected by a listener whose attention is so\nrelaxed that he gets no idea of the _meaning_ of the sentence at all.\nConversely, if words do belong to the same vocabulary, and if the\ngrammatical structure is correct, sentences with absolutely no meaning\nmay be uttered in good faith and pass unchallenged. Discourses at\nprayer-meetings, reshuffling the same collection of cant phrases,\nand the whole genus of penny-a-line-isms and newspaper-reporter's\nflourishes give illustrations of this. \"The birds filled the tree-tops\nwith their morning song, making the air moist, cool, and pleasant,\"\nis a sentence I remember reading once in a report of some athletic\nexercises in Jerome Park. It was probably written unconsciously by the\nhurried reporter, and read uncritically by many readers. An entire\nvolume of 784 pages lately published in Boston[236] is composed of\nstuff like this passage picked out at random:\n\"The flow of the efferent fluids of all these vessels from their\noutlets at the terminal loop of each culminate link on the surface of\nthe nuclear organism is continuous as their respective atmospheric\nfruitage up to the altitudinal limit of their expansibility, whence,\nwhen atmosphered by like but coalescing essences from higher\naltitudes,--those sensibly expressed as the essential qualities of\nexternal forms,--they descend, and become assimilated by the afferents\nof the nuclear organism.\"[237]\nThere are every year works published whose contents show them to be by\nreal lunatics. To the reader, the book quoted from seems pure nonsense\nfrom beginning to end. It is impossible to divine, in such a case,\njust what sort of feeling of rational relation between the words may\nhave appeared to the author's mind. The border line between objective\nsense and nonsense is hard to draw; that between subjective sense and\nnonsense, impossible. Subjectively, any collocation of words may make\nsense--even the wildest words in a dream--if one only does not doubt\ntheir belonging together. Take the obscurer passages in Hegel: it is a\nfair question whether the rationality included in them be anything more\nthan the fact that the words all belong to a common vocabulary, and are\nstrung together on a scheme of predication and relation,--immediacy,\nself-relation, and what not,--which has habitually recurred. Yet there\nseems no reason to doubt that the subjective feeling of the rationality\nof these sentences was strong in the writer as he penned them, or even\nthat some readers by straining may have reproduced it in themselves.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTo sum up, certain kinds of verbal associate, certain grammatical\nexpectations fulfilled, stand for a good part of our impression\nthat a sentence has a meaning and is dominated by the Unity of one\nThought. Nonsense in grammatical form sounds half rational; sense\nwith grammatical sequence upset sounds nonsensical; e.g., \"Elba the\nNapoleon English faith had banished broken to be Saint because Helena\nat.\" Finally, there is about each word the psychic 'overtone' of\nfeeling that it brings us nearer to a forefelt conclusion. Suffuse all\nthe words of a sentence, as they pass, with these three fringes or\nhaloes of relation, let the conclusion seem worth arriving at, and all\nwill admit the sentence to be an expression of thoroughly continuous,\nunified, and rational thought.[238]\nEach word, in such a sentence, is felt, not only as a word, but as\nhaving a _meaning_. The 'meaning' of a word taken thus dynamically in a\nsentence may be quite different from its meaning when taken statically\nor without context. The dynamic meaning is usually reduced to the bare\nfringe we have described, of felt suitability or unfitness to the\ncontext and conclusion. The static meaning, when the word is concrete,\nas 'table,' 'Boston,' consists of sensory images awakened; when it is\nabstract, as 'criminal legislation,' 'fallacy,' the meaning consists of\nother words aroused, forming the so-called 'definition.'\nHegel's celebrated dictum that pure being is identical with pure\nnothing results from his taking the words statically, or without the\nfringe they wear in a context. Taken in isolation, they agree in the\nsingle point of awakening no sensorial images. But taken dynamically,\nor as significant,--as _thought_,--their fringes of relation, their\naffinities and repugnances, their function and meaning, are felt and\nunderstood to be absolutely opposed.\nSuch considerations as these remove all appearance of paradox from\nthose cases of extremely deficient visual imagery of whose existence\nMr. Galton has made us aware (see below). An exceptionally intelligent\nfriend informs me that he can frame no image whatever of the appearance\nof his breakfast-table. When asked how he then remembers it at all, he\nsays he simple '_knows_' that it seated four people, and was covered\nwith a white cloth on which were a butter-dish, a coffee-pot, radishes,\nand so forth. The mind-stuff of which this 'knowing' is made seems\nto be verbal images exclusively. But if the words 'coffee,' 'bacon,'\n'muffins,' and 'eggs' lead a man to speak to his cook, to pay his\nbills, and to take measures for the morrow's meal exactly as visual\nand gustatory memories would, why are they not, for all practical\nintents and purposes, as good a kind of material in which to think?\nIn fact, we may suspect them to be for most purposes better than\nterms with a richer imaginative coloring. The scheme of relationship\nand the conclusion being the essential things in thinking, that kind\nof mind-stuff which is handiest will be the best for the purpose.\nNow words, uttered or unexpressed, are the handiest mental elements\nwe have. Not only are they very _rapidly_ revivable, but they are\nrevivable as actual sensations more easily than any other items of our\nexperience. Did they not possess some such advantage as this, it would\nhardly be the case that the older men are and the more effective as\nthinkers, the more, as a rule, they have lost their visualizing power\nand depend on words. This was ascertained by Mr. Galton to be the case\nwith members of the Royal Society. The present writer observes it in\nhis own person most distinctly.\nOn the other hand, a deaf and dumb man can weave his tactile and visual\nimages into a system of thought quite as effective and rational as\nthat of a word-user. _The question whether thought is possible without\nlanguage_ has been a favorite topic of discussion among philosophers.\nSome interesting reminiscences of his childhood by Mr. Ballard, a\ndeaf-mute instructor in the National College at Washington, show it to\nbe perfectly possible. A few paragraphs may be quoted here.\n\"In consequence of the loss of my hearing in infancy, I was debarred\nfrom enjoying the advantages which children in the full possession of\ntheir senses derive from the exercises of the common primary school,\nfrom the every-day talk of their school-fellows and playmates, and\nfrom the conversation of their parents and other grown-up persons.\n\"I could convey my thoughts and feelings to my parents and brothers by\nnatural signs or pantomime, and I could understand what they said to\nme by the same medium; our intercourse being, however, confined to the\ndaily routine of home affairs and hardly going beyond the circle of my\nown observation....\n\"My father adopted a course which he thought would, in some measure,\ncompensate me for the loss of my hearing. It was that of taking me\nwith him when business required him to ride abroad; and he took me\nmore frequently than he did my brothers; giving, as the reason for his\napparent partiality, that they could acquire information through the\near, while I depended solely upon my eye for acquaintance with affairs\nof the outside world....\n\"I have a vivid recollection of the delight I felt in watching the\ndifferent scenes we passed through, observing the various phases of\nnature, both animate and inanimate; though we did not, owing to my\ninfirmity, engage in conversation. It was during those delightful\nrides, some two or three years before my initiation into the rudiments\nof written language, that I began to ask myself the question: _How\ncame the world into being?_ When this question occurred to my mind, I\nset myself to thinking it over a long time. My curiosity was awakened\nas to what was the origin of human life in its first appearance upon\nthe earth, and of vegetable life as well, and also the cause of the\nexistence of the earth, sun, moon, and stars.\n\"I remember at one time when my eye fell upon a very large old stump\nwhich we happened to pass in one of our rides, I asked myself, 'Is\nit possible that the first man that ever came into the world rose\nout of that stump? But that stump is only a remnant of a once noble\nmagnificent tree, and how came that tree? Why, it came only by\nbeginning to grow out of the ground just like those little trees now\ncoming up.' And I dismissed from my mind, as an absurd idea, the\nconnection between the origin of man and a decaying old stump....\n\"I have no recollection of what it was that first suggested to me the\nquestion as to the origin of things. I had before this time gained\nideas of the descent from parent to child, of the propagation of\nanimals, and of the production of plants from seeds. The question that\noccurred to my mind was: whence came the first man, the first animal,\nand the first plant, at the remotest distance of time, before which\nthere was no man, no animal, no plant; since I knew they all had a\nbeginning and an end.\n\"It is impossible to state the exact order in which these different\nquestions arose, i.e., about men, animals, plants, the earth, sun,\nmoon, etc. The lower animals did not receive so much thought as was\nbestowed upon man and the earth; perhaps because I put man and beast\nin the same class, since I believed that man would be annihilated\nand there was no resurrection beyond the grave,--though I am told by\nmy mother that, in answer to my question, in the case of a deceased\nuncle who looked to me like a person in sleep, she had tried to make\nme understand that he would awake in the far future. It was my belief\nthat man and beast derived their being from the same source, and were\nto be laid down in the dust in a state of annihilation. Considering\nthe brute animal as of secondary importance, and allied to man on a\nlower level, man and the earth were the two things on which my mind\ndwelled most.\n\"I think I was five years old, when I began to understand the\ndescent from parent to child and the propagation of animals. I was\nnearly eleven years old, when I entered the Institution where I was\neducated; and I remember distinctly that it was at least two years\nbefore this time that I began to ask myself the question as to the\norigin of the universe. My age was then about eight, not over nine\nyears.\n\"Of the form of the earth, I had no idea in my childhood, except that,\nfrom a look at a map of the hemispheres, I inferred there were two\nimmense disks of matter lying near each other. I also believed the\nsun and moon to be round, flat plates of illuminating matter; and for\nthose luminaries I entertained a sort of reverence on account of their\npower of lighting and heating the earth. I thought from their coming\nup and going down, travelling across the sky in so regular a manner\nthat there must be a certain something having power to govern their\ncourse. I believed the sun went into a hole at the west and came out\nof another at the east, travelling through a great tube in the earth,\ndescribing the same curve as it seemed to describe in the sky. The\nstars seemed to me to be tiny lights studded in the sky.\n\"The source from which the universe came was the question about which\nmy mind revolved in a vain struggle to grasp it, or rather to fight\nthe way up to attain to a satisfactory answer. When I had occupied\nmyself with this subject a considerable time, I perceived that it was\na matter much greater than my mind could comprehend; and I remember\nwell that I became so appalled at its mystery and so bewildered at my\ninability to grapple with it that I laid the subject aside and out\nof my mind, glad to escape being, as it were, drawn into a vortex of\ninextricable confusion. Though I felt relieved at this escape, yet I\ncould not resist the desire to know the truth; and I returned to the\nsubject; but as before, I left it, after thinking it over for some\ntime. In this state of perplexity, I hoped all the time to get at the\ntruth, still believing that the more I gave thought to the subject,\nthe more my mind would penetrate the mystery. Thus I was tossed like\na shuttlecock, returning to the subject and recoiling from it, till I\ncame to school.\n\"I remember that my mother once told me about a being up above,\npointing her finger towards the sky and with a solemn look on her\ncountenance. I do not recall the circumstance which led to this\ncommunication. When she mentioned the mysterious being up in the sky,\nI was eager to take hold of the subject, and plied her with questions\nconcerning the form and appearance of this unknown being, asking if it\nwas the sun, moon, or one of the stars. I knew she meant that there\nwas a living one somewhere up in the sky; but when I realized that\nshe could not answer my questions, I gave it up in despair, feeling\nsorrowful that I could not obtain a definite idea of the mysterious\nliving one up in the sky.\n\"One day, while we were haying in a field, there was a series of\nheavy thunder-claps. I asked one of my brothers where they came from.\nHe pointed to the sky and made a zigzag motion with his finger,\nsignifying lightning. I imagined there was a great man somewhere in\nthe blue vault, who made a loud noise with his voice out of it; and\neach time I heard[239] a thunder-clap I was frightened, and looked up\nat the sky, fearing he was speaking a threatening word.\"[240]\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\nHere we may pause. The reader sees by this time that it makes little or\nno difference in what sort of mind-stuff, in what quality of imagery,\nhis thinking goes on. The only images _intrinsically_ important are\nthe halting-places, the substantive conclusions, provisional or final,\nof the thought. Throughout all the rest of the stream, the feelings of\nrelation are everything, and the terms related almost naught. These\nfeelings of relation, these psychic overtones, halos, suffusions, or\nfringes about the terms, may be the same in very different systems of\nimagery. A diagram may help to accentuate this indifference of the\nmental means where the end is the same. Let _A_ be some experience from\nwhich a number of thinkers start. Let _Z_ be the practical conclusion\nrationally inferrible from it. One gets to the conclusion by one line,\nanother by another; one follows a course of English, another of German,\nverbal imagery. With one, visual images predominate; with another,\ntactile. Some trains are tinged with emotions, others not; some are\nvery abridged, synthetic and rapid, others, hesitating and broken into\nmany steps. But when the penultimate terms of all the trains, however\ndiffering _inter se_, finally shoot into the same conclusion, we say\nand rightly say, that all the thinkers have had substantially the same\nthought. It would probably astound each of them beyond measure to be\nlet into his neighbor's mind and to find how different the scenery\nthere was from that in his own.\nThought is in fact a kind of Algebra, as Berkeley long ago said, \"in\nwhich, though a particular quantity be marked by each letter, yet to\nproceed right, it is not requisite that in every step each letter\nsuggest to your thoughts that particular quantity it was appointed to\nstand for.\" Mr. Lewes has developed this algebra-analogy so well that I\nmust quote his words:\n\"The leading characteristic of algebra is that of operation on\nrelations. This also is the leading characteristic of Thought.\nAlgebra cannot exist without values, nor Thought without Feelings.\nThe operations are so many blank forms till the values are assigned.\nWords are vacant sounds, ideas are blank forms, unless they symbolize\nimages and sensations which are their values. Nevertheless it is\nrigorously true, and of the greatest importance, that analysts carry\non very extensive operations with blank forms, never pausing to\nsupply the symbols with values until the calculation is completed;\nand ordinary men, no less than philosophers, carry on long trains\nof thought without pausing to translate their ideas (words) into\nimages.... Suppose some one from a distance shouts 'a lion!' At once\nthe man starts in alarm.... To the man the word is not only an ...\nexpression of all that he has seen and heard of lions, capable of\nrecalling various experiences, but is also capable of taking its\nplace in a connected series of thoughts without recalling any of\nthose experiences, without reviving an image, however faint, of the\nlion--simply as a sign of a certain relation included in the complex\nso named. Like an algebraic symbol it may be operated on without\nconveying other significance than an abstract relation: it is a sign\nof Danger, related to fear with all its motor sequences. Its logical\nposition suffices.... Ideas are _substitutions_ which require a\nsecondary process when what is symbolized by them is translated into\nthe images and experiences it replaces; and this secondary process is\nfrequently not performed at all, generally only performed to a very\nsmall extent. Let anyone closely examine what has passed in his mind\nwhen he has constructed a chain of reasoning, and he will be surprised\nat the fewness and faintness of the images which have accompanied the\nideas. Suppose you inform me that 'the blood rushed violently from\nthe man's heart, quickening his pulse at the sight of his enemy.'\nOf the many latent images in this phrase, how many were salient in\nyour mind and in mine? Probably two--the man and his enemy--and these\nimages were faint. Images of blood, heart, violent rushing, pulse,\nquickening, and sight, were either not revived at all, or were passing\nshadows. Had any such images arisen, they would have hampered thought,\nretarding the logical process of judgment by irrelevant connections.\nThe symbols had substituted _relations_ for these _values_.... There\nare no images of two things and three things, when I say 'two and\nthree equal five;' there are simply familiar symbols having precise\nrelations.... The verbal symbol 'horse,' which stands for all our\nexperiences of horses, serves all the purposes of Thought, without\nrecalling one of the images clustered in the perception of horses,\njust as the sight of a horse's form serves all the purposes of\n_recognition_ without recalling the sound of its neighing or its\ntramp, its qualities as an animal of draught, and so forth.\"[241]\nIt need only be added that as the Algebrist, though the sequence of his\nterms is fixed by their relations rather than by their several values,\nmust give a real value to the _final_ one he reaches; so the thinker\nin words must let his concluding word or phrase be translated into its\nfull sensible-image-value, under penalty of the thought being left\nunrealized and pale.\nThis is all I have to say about the sensible continuity and unity of\nour thought as contrasted with the apparent discreteness of the words,\nimages, and other means by which it seems to be carried on. Between all\ntheir substantive elements there is 'transitive' consciousness, and the\nwords and images are 'fringed,' and not as discrete as to a careless\nview they seem. Let us advance now to the next head in our description\nof Thought's stream.\n4. _Human thought appears to deal with objects independent of itself;\nthat is, it is cognitive, or possesses the function of knowing._\nFor Absolute Idealism, the infinite Thought and its objects are one.\nThe Objects are, through being thought; the eternal Mind is, through\nthinking them. Were a human thought alone in the world there would be\nno reason for any other assumption regarding it. Whatever it might\nhave before it would be its vision, would be there, in _its_ 'there,'\nor then, in _its_ 'then'; and the question would never arise whether\nan extra-mental duplicate of it existed or not. The reason why we all\nbelieve that the objects of our thoughts have a duplicate existence\noutside, is that there are _many_ human thoughts, each with the _same_\nobjects, as we cannot help supposing. The judgment that _my_ thought\nhas the same object as _his_ thought is what makes the psychologist\ncall my thought cognitive of an outer reality. The judgment that my own\npast thought and my own present thought are of the same object is what\nmakes _me_ take the object out of either and project it by a sort of\ntriangulation into an independent position, from which it may _appear_\nto both. _Sameness_ in a multiplicity of objective appearances is\nthus the basis of our belief in realities outside of thought.[242] In\nChapter XII we shall have to take up the judgment of sameness again.\nTo show that the question of reality being extra-mental or not is not\nlikely to arise in the absence of repeated experiences of the _same_,\ntake the example of an altogether unprecedented experience, such as\na new taste in the throat. Is it a subjective quality of feeling, or\nan objective quality felt? You do not even ask the question at this\npoint. It is simply _that taste_. But if a doctor hears you describe\nit, and says: \"Ha! Now you know what _heartburn_ is,\" then it becomes\na quality already existent _extra mentem tuam_, which you in turn have\ncome upon and learned. The first spaces, times, things, qualities,\nexperienced by the child probably appear, like the first heartburn, in\nthis absolute way, as simple _beings_, neither in nor out of thought.\nBut later, by having other thoughts than this present one, and making\nrepeated judgments of sameness among their objects, he corroborates in\nhimself the notion of realities, past and distant as well as present,\nwhich realities no one single thought either possesses or engenders,\nbut which all may contemplate and know. This, as was stated in the\nlast chapter, is the _psychological_ point of view, the relatively\nuncritical non-idealistic point of view of all natural science, beyond\nwhich this book cannot go. A mind which has become conscious of its own\ncognitive function, plays what we have called 'the psychologist' upon\nitself. It not only knows the things that appear before it; it knows\nthat it knows them. This stage of reflective condition is, more or\nless explicitly, our habitual adult state of mind.\nIt cannot, however, be regarded as primitive. The consciousness\nof objects must come first. We seem to lapse into this primordial\ncondition when consciousness is reduced to a minimum by the inhalation\nof an\u00e6sthetics or during a faint. Many persons testify that at a\ncertain stage of the an\u00e6sthetic process objects are still cognized\nwhilst the thought of self is lost. Professor Herzen says:[243]\n\"During the syncope there is absolute psychic annihilation, the\nabsence of all consciousness; then at the beginning of coming to,\none has at a certain moment a vague, limitless, infinite feeling--a\nsense of _existence in general_ without the least trace of distinction\nbetween the me and the not-me.\"\nDr. Shoemaker of Philadelphia describes during the deepest conscious\nstage of ether-intoxication a vision of\n\"two endless parallel lines in swift longitudinal motion ... on a\nuniform misty background ... together with a constant sound or whirr,\nnot loud but distinct ... which seemed to be connected with the\nparallel lines.... These phenomena occupied the whole field. There\nwere present no dreams or visions in any way connected with human\naffairs, no ideas or impressions akin to anything in past experience,\nno emotions, of course no idea of personality. There was no conception\nas to what being it was that was regarding the two lines, or that\nthere existed any such thing as such a being; the lines and waves were\nall.\"[244]\nSimilarly a friend of Mr. Herbert Spencer, quoted by him in 'Mind' (vol\niii, p. 556), speaks of \"an undisturbed empty quiet everywhere except\nthat a stupid presence lay like a heavy intrusion _somewhere_--a blotch\non the calm.\" This sense of objectivity and lapse of subjectivity, even\nwhen the object is almost indefinable, is, it seems to me, a somewhat\nfamiliar phase in chloroformization, though in my own case it is too\ndeep a phase for any articulate after-memory to remain. I only know\nthat as it vanishes I seem to wake to a sense of my own existence as\nsomething additional to what had previously been there.[245]\nMany philosophers, however, hold that the reflective consciousness\nof the self is essential to the cognitive function of thought. They\nhold that a thought, in order to know a thing at all, must expressly\ndistinguish between the thing and its own self.[246] This is a\nperfectly wanton assumption, and not the faintest shadow of reason\nexists for supposing it true. As well might I contend that I cannot\ndream without dreaming that I dream, swear without swearing that I\nswear, deny without denying that I deny, as maintain that I cannot\nknow without knowing that I know. I may have either acquaintance-with,\nor knowledge-about, an object O without think about myself at all. It\nsuffices for this that I think O, and that it exist. If, in addition\nto thinking O, I also think that I exist and that I know O, well and\ngood; I then know one more thing, a fact about O, of which I previously\nwas unmindful. That, however, does not prevent me from having already\nknown O a good deal. O _per se_, or O _plus_ P, are as good objects\nof knowledge as O _plus me_ is. The philosophers in question simply\nsubstitute one particular object for all others, and call it _the_\nobject _par excellence_. It is a case of the 'psychologist's fallacy'\n(see p. 197). _They_ know the object to be one thing and the thought\nanother; and they forthwith foist their own knowledge into that of the\nthought of which they pretend to give a true account. To conclude,\nthen, _thought may, but need not, in knowing, discriminate between its\nobject and itself._\nWe have been using the word Object. _Something must now be said about\nthe proper use of the term Object in Psychology._\nIn popular parlance the word object is commonly taken without reference\nto the act of knowledge, and treated as synonymous with individual\nsubject of existence. Thus if anyone ask what is the mind's object when\nyou say 'Columbus discovered America in 1492,' most people will reply\n'Columbus,' or 'America,' or, at most, 'the discovery of America.' They\nwill name a substantive kernel or nucleus of the consciousness, and say\nthe thought is 'about' that,--as indeed it is,--and they will call that\nyour thought's 'object.' Really that is usually only the grammatical\nobject, or more likely the grammatical subject, of your sentence. It\nis at most your 'fractional object;' or you may call it the 'topic'\nof your thought, or the 'subject of your discourse.' But the _Object_\nof your thought is really its entire content or deliverance, neither\nmore nor less. It is a vicious use of speech to take out a substantive\nkernel from its content and call that its object; and it is an equally\nvicious use of speech to add a substantive kernel not articulately\nincluded in its content, and to call that its object. Yet either\none of these two sins we commit, whenever we content ourselves with\nsaying that a given thought is simply 'about' a certain topic, or that\nthat topic is its 'object.' The object of my thought in the previous\nsentence, for example, is strictly speaking neither Columbus, nor\nAmerica, nor its discovery. It is nothing short of the entire sentence,\n'Columbus-discovered-America-in-1492.' And if we wish to speak of it\nsubstantively, we must make a substantive of it by writing it out thus\nwith hyphens between all its words. Nothing but this can possibly name\nits delicate idiosyncrasy. And if we wish to _feel_ that idiosyncrasy\nwe must reproduce the thought as it was uttered, with every word\nfringed and the whole sentence bathed in that original halo of obscure\nrelations, which, like an horizon, then spread about its meaning.\nOur psychological duty is to cling as closely as possible to the actual\nconstitution of the thought we are studying. We may err as much by\nexcess as by defect. If the kernel or 'topic,' Columbus, is in one way\nless than the thought's object, so in another way it may be more. That\nis, when named by the psychologist, it may mean much more than actually\nis present to the thought of which he is reporter. Thus, for example,\nsuppose you should go on to think: 'He was a daring genius!' An\nordinary psychologist would not hesitate to say that the object of your\nthought was still 'Columbus.' True, your thought is _about_ Columbus.\nIt 'terminates' in Columbus, leads from and to the direct idea of\nColumbus. But for the moment it is not fully and immediately Columbus,\nit is only 'he,' or rather 'he-was-a-daring-genius;' which, though it\nmay be an unimportant difference for conversational purposes, is, for\nintrospective psychology, as great a difference as there can be.\nThe object of every thought, then, is neither more nor less than all\nthat the thought thinks, exactly as the thought thinks it, however\ncomplicated the matter, and however symbolic the manner of the thinking\nmay be. It is needless to say that memory can seldom accurately\nreproduce such an object, when once it has passed from before the\nmind. It either makes too little or too much of it. Its best plan is\nto repeat the verbal sentence, if there was one, in which the object\nwas expressed. But for inarticulate thoughts there is not even this\nresource, and introspection must confess that the task exceeds her\npowers. The mass of our thinking vanishes for ever, beyond hope of\nrecovery, and psychology only gathers up a few of the crumbs that fall\nfrom the feast.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe next point to make clear is that, _however complex the object may\nbe, the thought of it is one undivided state of consciousness_. As\nThomas Brown says:[247]\n\"I have already spoken too often to require again to caution you\nagainst the mistake into which, I confess, that the terms which the\npoverty of our language obliges us to use might of themselves very\nnaturally lead you; the mistake of supposing that the most complex\nstates of mind are not truly, in their very essence, as much one and\nindivisible as those which we term simple--the complexity and seeming\ncoexistence which they involve being relative to our feeling[248]\nonly, not to their own absolute nature. I trust I need not repeat to\nyou that, in itself, every notion, however seemingly complex, is, and\nmust be, truly simple--being one state or affection, of one simple\nsubstance, mind. Our conception of a whole army, for example, is as\ntruly this one mind existing in this one state, as our conception\nof any of the individuals that compose an army. Our notion of the\nabstract numbers, eight, four, two, is as truly one feeling of the\nmind as our notion of simple unity.\"\nThe ordinary associationist-psychology supposes, in contrast with\nthis, that whenever an object of thought contains many elements,\nthe thought itself must be made up of just as many ideas, one idea\nfor each element, and all fused together in appearance, but really\nseparate.[249] The enemies of this psychology find (as we have already\nseen) little trouble in showing that such a bundle of separate ideas\nwould never form one thought at all, and they contend that an Ego\nmust be added to the bundle to give it unity, and bring the various\nideas into relation with each other.[250] We will not discuss the\nego just yet, but it is obvious that if things are to be thought in\nrelation, they must be thought together, and in one _something_, be\nthat something ego, psychosis, state of consciousness, or whatever\nyou please. If not thought with each other, things are not thought in\nrelation at all. Now most believers in the ego make the same mistake as\nthe associationists and sensationists whom they oppose. Both agree that\nthe elements of the subjective stream are discrete and separate and\nconstitute what Kant calls a 'manifold.' But while the associationists\nthink that a 'manifold' can form a single knowledge, the egoists\ndeny this, and say that the knowledge comes only when the manifold\nis subjected to the synthetizing activity of an ego. Both make an\nidentical initial hypothesis; but the egoist, finding it won't express\nthe facts, adds another hypothesis to correct it. Now I do not wish\njust yet to 'commit myself' about the existence or non-existence of the\nego, but I do contend that we need not invoke it for this particular\nreason--namely, because the manifold of ideas has to be reduced to\nunity. _There is no manifold of coexisting ideas;_ the notion of such\na thing is a chimera. _Whatever things are thought in relation are\nthought from the outset in a unity, in a single pulse of subjectivity,\na single psychosis, feeling, or state of mind._\nThe reason why this fact is so strangely garbled in the books seems to\nbe what on an earlier page (see p. 196 ff.) I called the psychologist's\nfallacy. We have the inveterate habit, whenever we try introspectively\nto describe one of our thoughts, of dropping the thought as it is in\nitself and talking of something else. We describe the things that\nappear to the thought, and we describe other thoughts _about_ those\nthings--as if these and the original thought were the same. If, for\nexample, the thought be 'the pack of cards is on the table,' we say,\n\"Well, isn't it a thought of the pack of cards? Isn't it of the cards\nas included in the pack? Isn't it of the table? And of the legs of\nthe table as well? The table has legs--how can you think the table\nwithout virtually thinking its legs? Hasn't our thought then, all these\nparts--one part for the pack and another for the table? And within the\npack-part a part for each card, as within the table-part a part for\neach leg? And isn't each of these parts an idea? And can our thought,\nthen, be anything but an assemblage or pack of ideas, each answering to\nsome element of what it knows?\"\nNow not one of these assumptions is true. The thought taken as an\nexample is, in the first place, not of 'a pack of cards.' It is of\n'the-pack-of-cards-is-on-the-table,' an entirely different subjective\nphenomenon, whose Object implies the pack, and every one of the cards\nin it, but whose conscious constitution bears very little resemblance\nto that of the thought of the pack _per se_. What a thought _is_,\nand what it may be developed into, or explained to stand for, and be\nequivalent to, are two things, not one.[251]\nAn analysis of what passes through the mind as we utter the phrase _the\npack of cards is on the table_ will, I hope, make this clear, and may\nat the same time condense into a concrete example a good deal of what\nhas gone before.\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--The Stream of Consciousness.]\nIt takes time to utter the phrase. Let the horizontal line in Fig.\n29 represent time. Every part of it will then stand for a fraction,\nevery point for an instant, of the time. Of course the thought has\n_time-parts_. The part 2-3 of it, though continuous with 1-2, is yet a\ndifferent part from 1-2. Now I say of these time-parts that we cannot\ntake any one of them so short that it will not after some fashion or\nother be a thought of the whole object 'the pack of cards is on the\ntable.' They melt into each other like dissolving views, and no two of\nthem feel the object just alike, but each feels the total object in\na unitary undivided way. This is what I mean by denying that in the\nthought any parts can be found corresponding to the object's parts.\nTime-parts are not such parts.\nNow let the vertical dimensions of the figure stand for the objects\nor contents of the thoughts. A line vertical to any point of the\nhorizontal, as _1-1'_, will then symbolize the object in the mind\nat the instant 1; a space above the horizontal, as 1-1'-2'-2, will\nsymbolize all that passes through the mind during the time 1-2 whose\nline it covers. The entire diagram from 0 to 0' represents a finite\nlength of thought's stream.\nCan we now define the psychic constitution of each vertical section of\nthis segment? We can, though in a very rough way. Immediately after\n0, even before we have opened our mouths to speak, the entire thought\nis present to our mind in the form of an intention to utter that\nsentence. This intention, though it has no simple name, and though it\nis a transitive state immediately displaced by the first word, is yet\na perfectly determinate phase of thought, unlike anything else (see p.\n253). Again, immediately before 0', after the last word of the sentence\nis spoken, all will admit that we again think its entire content as\nwe inwardly realize its completed deliverance. All vertical sections\nmade through any other parts of the diagram will be respectively filled\nwith other ways of feeling the sentence's meaning. Through 2, for\nexample, the cards will be the part of the object most emphatically\npresent to the mind; through 4, the table. The stream is made higher\nin the drawing at its end than at its beginning, because the final way\nof feeling the content is fuller and richer than the initial way. As\nJoubert says, \"we only know just what we meant to say, after we have\nsaid it.\" And as M. V. Egger remarks, \"before speaking, one barely\nknows what one intends to say, but afterwards one is filled with\nadmiration and surprise at having said and thought it so well.\"\nThis latter author seems to me to have kept at much closer quarters\nwith the facts than any other analyst of consciousness.[252] But even\nhe does not quite hit the mark, for, as I understand him, he thinks\nthat each word as it occupies the mind _displaces_ the rest of the\nthought's content. He distinguishes the 'idea' (what I have called\nthe total _object_ or meaning) from the consciousness of the words,\ncalling the former a very feeble state, and contrasting it with the\nliveliness of the words, even when these are only silently rehearsed.\n\"The feeling,\" he says, \"of the words makes ten or twenty times more\nnoise in our consciousness than the sense of the phrase, which for\nconsciousness is a very slight matter.\"[253] And having distinguished\nthese two things, he goes on to separate them in time, saying that\nthe idea may either precede or follow the words, but that it is a\n'pure illusion' to suppose them simultaneous.[254] Now I believe\nthat in all cases where the words are _understood_, the total idea\nmay be and usually is present not only before and after the phrase\nhas been spoken, but also whilst each separate word is uttered.[255]\nIt is the overtone, halo, or fringe of the word, _as spoken in that\nsentence_. It is never absent; no word in an understood sentence comes\nto consciousness as a mere noise. We feel its meaning as it passes;\nand although our object differs from one moment to another as to its\nverbal kernel or nucleus, yet it is _similar_ throughout the entire\nsegment of the stream. The same object is known everywhere, now from\nthe point of view, if we may so call it, of this word, now from the\npoint of view of that. And in our feeling of each word there chimes an\necho or foretaste of every other. The consciousness of the 'Idea' and\nthat of the words are thus consubstantial. They are made of the same\n'mind-stuff,' and form an unbroken stream. Annihilate a mind at any\ninstant, cut its thought through whilst yet uncompleted, and examine\nthe object present to the cross-section thus suddenly made; you will\nfind, not the bald word in process of utterance, but that word suffused\nwith the whole idea. The word may be so loud, as M. Egger would say,\nthat we cannot _tell_ just how its suffusion, as such, feels, or how it\ndiffers from the suffusion of the next word. But it does differ; and we\nmaybe sure that, could we see into the brain, we should find the same\nprocesses active through the entire sentence in different degrees, each\none in turn becoming maximally excited and then yielding the momentary\nverbal 'kernel,' to the thought's content, at other times being only\nsub-excited, and then combining with the other sub-excited processes to\ngive the overtone or fringe.[256]\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\nWe may illustrate this by a farther development of the diagram on p.\n279. Let the objective content of any vertical section through the\nstream be represented no longer by a line, but by a plane figure,\nhighest opposite whatever part of the object is most prominent in\nconsciousness at the moment when the section is made. This part, in\nverbal thought, will usually be some word. A series of sections 1-1',\ntaken at the moments 1, 2, 3, would then look like this: horizontal\nbreadth stands for the entire object in each of the figures; the\nheight of the curve above each part of that object marks the relative\nprominence of that part in the thought. At the moment symbolized by the\nfirst figure _pack_ is the prominent part; in the third figure it is\n_table_, etc.\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\nWe can easily add all these plane sections together to make a solid,\none of whose solid dimensions will represent time, whilst a cut across\nthis at right angles will give the thought's content at the moment when\nthe cut is made. Let it be the thought, 'I am the same I that I was\nyesterday.' If at the fourth moment of time we annihilate the thinker\nand examine how the last pulsation of his consciousness was made, we\nfind that it was an awareness of the whole content with _same_ most\nprominent, and the other parts of the thing known relatively less\ndistinct. With each prolongation of the scheme in the time-direction,\nthe summit of the curve of section would come further towards the end\nof the sentence. If we make a solid wooden frame with the sentence\nwritten on its front, and the time-scale on one of its sides, if\nwe spread flatly a sheet of India rubber over its top, on which\nrectangular co-ordinates are painted, and slide a smooth ball under\nthe rubber in the direction from 0 to 'yesterday,' the bulging of the\nmembrane along this diagonal at successive moments will symbolize the\nchanging of the thought's content in a way plain enough, after what\nhas been said, to call for no more explanation. Or to express it in\ncerebral terms, it will show the relative intensities, at successive\nmoments, of the several nerve-processes to which the various parts of\nthe thought-object correspond.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe last peculiarity of consciousness to which attention is to be drawn\nin this first rough description of its stream is that\n5) _It is always interested more in one part of its object than in\nanother, and welcomes and rejects, or chooses, all the while it thinks._\nThe phenomena of selective attention and of deliberative will are\nof course patent examples of this choosing activity. But few of us\nare aware how incessantly it is at work in operations not ordinarily\ncalled by these names. Accentuation and Emphasis are present in\nevery perception we have. We find it quite impossible to disperse\nour attention impartially over a number of impressions. A monotonous\nsuccession of sonorous strokes is broken up into rhythms, now of\none sort, now of another, by the different accent which we place on\ndifferent strokes. The simplest of these rhythms is the double one,\ntick-t\u00f3ck, tick-t\u00f3ck, tick-t\u00f3ck. Dots dispersed on a surface are\nperceived in rows and groups. Lines separate into diverse figures. The\nubiquity of the distinctions, _this_ and _that, here_ and _there, now_\nand _then_, in our minds is the result of our laying the same selective\nemphasis on parts of place and time.\nBut we do far more than emphasize things, and unite some, and keep\nothers apart. We actually _ignore_ most of the things before us. Let me\nbriefly show how this goes on.\nTo begin at the bottom, what are our very senses themselves but\norgans of selection? Out of the infinite chaos of movements, of which\nphysics teaches us that the outer world consists, each sense-organ\npicks out those which fall within certain limits of velocity. To\nthese it responds, but ignores the rest as completely as if they did\nnot exist. It thus accentuates particular movements in a manner for\nwhich objectively there seems no valid ground; for, as Lange says,\nthere is no reason whatever to think that the gap in Nature between\nthe highest sound-waves and the lowest heat-waves is an abrupt break\nlike that of our sensations; or that the difference between violet\nand ultra-violet rays has anything like the objective importance\nsubjectively represented by that between light and darkness. Out of\nwhat is in itself an undistinguishable, swarming _continuum_, devoid of\ndistinction or emphasis, our senses make for us, by attending to this\nmotion and ignoring that, a world full of contrasts, of sharp accents,\nof abrupt changes, of picturesque light and shade.\nIf the sensations we receive from a given organ have their causes thus\npicked out for us by the conformation of the organ's termination,\nAttention, on the other hand, out of all the sensations yielded,\npicks out certain ones as worthy of its notice and suppresses all the\nrest. Helmholtz's work on Optics is little more than a study of those\nvisual sensations of which common men never become aware--blind spots,\n_musc\u00e6 volitantes_, after-images, irradiation, chromatic fringes,\nmarginal changes of color, double images, astigmatism, movements of\naccommodation and convergence, retinal rivalry, and more besides. We do\nnot even know without special training on which of our eyes an image\nfalls. So habitually ignorant are most men of this that one may be\nblind for years of a single eye and never know the fact.\nHelmholtz says that we notice only those sensations which are signs to\nus of _things_. But what are things? Nothing, as we shall abundantly\nsee, but special groups of sensible qualities, which happen practically\nor \u00e6sthetically to interest us, to which we therefore give substantive\nnames, and which we exalt to this exclusive status of independence\nand dignity. But in itself, apart from my interest, a particular\ndust-wreath on a windy day is just as much of an individual thing, and\njust as much or as little deserves an individual name, as my own body\ndoes.\nAnd then, among the sensations we get from each separate thing,\nwhat happens? The mind selects again. It chooses certain of the\nsensations to represent the thing most _truly_, and considers the\nrest as its appearances, modified by the conditions of the moment.\nThus my table-top is named _square_, after but one of an infinite\nnumber of retinal sensations which it yields, the rest of them being\nsensations of two acute and two obtuse angles; but I call the latter\n_perspective_ views, and the four right angles the _true_ form of the\ntable, and erect the attribute squareness; into the table's essence,\nfor \u00e6sthetic reasons of my own. In like manner, the real form of the\ncircle is deemed to be the sensation it gives when the line of vision\nis perpendicular to its centre--all its other sensations are signs of\nthis sensation. The real sound of the cannon is the sensation it makes\nwhen the ear is close by. The real color of the brick is the sensation\nit gives when the eye looks squarely at it from a near point, out of\nthe sunshine and yet not in the gloom; under other circumstances it\ngives us other color-sensations which are but signs of this--we then\nsee it looks pinker or blacker than it really is. The reader knows\nno object which he does not represent to himself by preference as in\nsome typical attitude, of some normal size, at some characteristic\ndistance, of some standard tint, etc., etc. But all these essential\ncharacteristics, which together form for us the genuine objectivity\nof the thing and are contrasted with what we call the subjective\nsensations it may yield us at a given moment, are mere sensations\nlike the latter. The mind chooses to suit itself, and decides what\nparticular sensation shall be held more real and valid than all the\nrest.\nThus perception involves a twofold choice. Out of all present\nsensations, we notice mainly such as are significant of absent ones;\nand out of all the absent associates which these suggest, we again pick\nout a very few to stand for the objective reality _par excellence_. We\ncould have no more exquisite example of selective industry.\nThat industry goes on to deal with the things thus given in perception.\nA man's empirical thought depends on the things he has experienced,\nbut what these shall be is to a large extent determined by his habits\nof attention. A thing may be present to him a thousand times, but if\nhe persistently fails to notice it, it cannot be said to enter into\nhis experience. We are all seeing flies, moths, and beetles by the\nthousand, but to whom, save an entomologist, do they say anything\ndistinct? On the other hand, a thing met only once in a lifetime may\nleave an indelible experience in the memory. Let four men make a tour\nin Europe. One will bring home only picturesque impressions--costumes\nand colors, parks and views and works of architecture, pictures and\nstatues. To another all this will be non-existent; and distances\nand prices, populations and drainage-arrangements, door- and\nwindow-fastenings, and other useful statistics will take their place.\nA third will give a rich account of the theatres, restaurants, and\npublic balls, and naught beside; whilst the fourth will perhaps have\nbeen so wrapped in his own subjective broodings as to tell little more\nthan a few names of places through which he passed. Each has selected,\nout of the same mass of presented objects, those which suited his\nprivate interest and has made his experience thereby.\nIf, now, leaving the empirical combination of objects, we ask how the\nmind proceeds _rationally_ to connect them, we find selection again\nto be omnipotent. In a future chapter we shall see that all Reasoning\ndepends on the ability of the mind to break up the totality of the\nphenomenon reasoned about, into parts, and to pick out from among these\nthe particular one which, in our given emergency, may lead to the\nproper conclusion. Another predicament will need another conclusion,\nand require another element to be picked out. The man of genius is he\nwho will always stick in his bill at the right point, and bring it\nout with the right element--'reason' if the emergency be theoretical,\n'means' if it be practical--transfixed upon it. I here confine myself\nto this brief statement, but it may suffice to show that Reasoning is\nbut another form of the selective activity of the mind.\nIf now we pass to its \u00e6sthetic department, our law is still more\nobvious. The artist notoriously selects his items, rejecting all\ntones, colors, shapes, which do not harmonize with each other and with\nthe main purpose of his work. That unity, harmony, 'convergence of\ncharacters,' as M. Taine calls it, which gives to works of art their\nsuperiority over works of nature, is wholly due to _elimination_. Any\nnatural subject will do, if the artist has wit enough to pounce upon\nsome one feature of it as characteristic, and suppress all merely\naccidental items which do not harmonize with this.\nAscending still higher, we reach the plane of Ethics, where choice\nreigns notoriously supreme. An act has no ethical quality whatever\nunless it be chosen out of several all equally possible. To sustain the\narguments for the good course and keep them ever before us, to stifle\nour longing for more flowery ways, to keep the foot unflinchingly\non the arduous path, these are characteristic ethical energies. But\nmore than these; for these but deal with the means of compassing\ninterests already felt by the man to be supreme. The ethical energy\n_par excellence_ has to go farther and choose which _interest_ out of\nseveral, equally coercive, shall become supreme. The issue here is of\nthe utmost pregnancy, for it decides a man's entire career. When he\ndebates, Shall I commit this crime? choose that profession? accept that\noffice, or marry this fortune?--his choice really lies between one of\nseveral equally possible future Characters. What he shall _become_ is\nfixed by the conduct of this moment. Schopenhauer, who enforces his\ndeterminism by the argument that with a given fixed character only one\nreaction is possible under given circumstances, forgets that, in these\ncritical ethical moments, what consciously _seems_ to be in question\nis the complexion of the character itself. The problem with the man is\nless what act he shall now choose to do, than what being he shall now\nresolve to become.\nLooking back, then, over this review, we see that the mind is at every\nstage a theatre of simultaneous possibilities. Consciousness consists\nin the comparison of these with each other, the selection of some, and\nthe suppression of the rest by the reinforcing and inhibiting agency of\nattention. The highest and most elaborated mental products are filtered\nfrom the data chosen by the faculty next beneath, out of the mass\noffered by the faculty below that, which mass in turn was sifted from\na still larger amount of yet simpler material, and so on. The mind, in\nshort, works on the data it receives very much as a sculptor works on\nhis block of stone. In a sense the statue stood there from eternity.\nBut there were a thousand different ones beside it, and the sculptor\nalone is to thank for having extricated this one from the rest. Just so\nthe world of each of us, howsoever different our several views of it\nmay be, all lay embedded in the primordial chaos of sensations, which\ngave the mere _matter_ to the thought of all of us indifferently. We\nmay, if we like, by our reasonings unwind things back to that black\nand jointless continuity of space and moving clouds of swarming atoms\nwhich science calls the only real world. But all the while the world\n_we_ feel and live in will be that which our ancestors and we, by\nslowly cumulative strokes of choice, have extricated out of this, like\nsculptors, by simply rejecting certain portions of the given stuff.\nOther sculptors, other statues from the same stone! Other minds, other\nworlds from the same monotonous and inexpressive chaos! My world is but\none in a million alike embedded, alike real to those who may abstract\nthem. How different must be the worlds in the consciousness of ant,\ncuttle-fish, or crab!\n*       *       *       *       *\nBut in my mind and your mind the rejected portions and the selected\nportions of the original world-stuff are to a great extent the same.\nThe human race as a whole largely agrees as to what it shall notice and\nname, and what not. And among the noticed parts we select in much the\nsame way for accentuation and preference or subordination and dislike.\nThere is, however, one entirely extraordinary case in which no two\nmen ever are known to choose alike. One great splitting of the whole\nuniverse into two halves is made by each of us; and for each of us\nalmost all of the interest attaches to one of the halves; but we all\ndraw the line of division between them in a different place. When I\nsay that we all call the two halves by the same; names, and that those\nnames are '_me_' and '_not-me_' respectively, it will at once be seen\nwhat I mean. The altogether unique kind of interest which each human\nmind feels in those parts of creation which it can call _me_ or _mine_\nmay be a moral riddle, but it is a fundamental psychological fact.\nNo mind can take the same interest in his neighbor's _me_ as in his\nown. The neighbor's me falls together with all the rest of things in\none foreign mass, against which his own _me_ stands out in startling\nrelief. Even the trodden worm, as Lotze somewhere says, contrasts his\nown suffering self with the whole remaining universe, though he have no\nclear conception either of himself or of what the universe may be. He\nis for me a mere part of the world; for him it is I who am the mere\npart. Each of us dichotomizes the Kosmos in a different place.\nDescending now to finer work than this first general sketch, let\nus in the next chapter try to trace the psychology of this fact of\nself-consciousness to which we have thus once more been led.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[215] A good deal of this chapter is reprinted from an article 'On some\nOmissions of Introspective Psychology' which appeared in 'Mind' for\nJanuary 1884.\n[216] B.

That would be as improbable a consequence as that in the sea\na wave-crest should never come twice at the same point of space. What\ncan hardly come twice is an identical _combination_ of wave-forms all\nwith their crests and hollows reoccupying identical places. For such a\ntotal combination as this is the analogue of the brain-state to which\nour actual consciousness at any moment is due.\n[225] The accurate registration of the 'how long' is still a little\nmysterious.\n[226] Cf. Brentano; Psychologie, vol. i, pp. 219-20. Altogether this\nchapter of Brentano's on the Unity of Consciousness is as good as\nanything with which I am acquainted.\n[227] Honor to whom honor is due! The most explicit acknowledgment I\nhave anywhere found of all this is in a buried and forgotten paper by\nthe Rev. Jas. Wills, on 'Accidental Association,' in the Transactions\nof the Royal Irish Academy, vol xxi, part i (1846). Mr. Wills writes:\n\"At every instant of conscious thought there is a certain sum of\nperceptions, or reflections, or both together, present, and together\nconstituting one whole state of apprehension. Of this some definite\nportion may be far more distinct than all the rest; and the rest be in\nconsequence proportionally vague, even to the limit of obliteration.\nBut still, within this limit, the most dim shade of perception enters\ninto, and in some infinitesimal degree modifies, the whole existing\nstate. This state will thus be in some way modified by any sensation\nor emotion, or act of distinct attention, that may give prominence to\nany part of it; so that the actual result is capable of the utmost\nvariation, according to the person or the occasion.... To any portion\nof the entire scope here described there may be a special direction of\nthe attention, and this special direction is recognized as strictly\nwhat is _recognized_ as the idea present to the mind. This idea is\nevidently not commensurate with the entire state of apprehension,\nand much perplexity has arisen from not observing this fact. However\ndeeply we may suppose the attention to be engaged by any thought,\nany considerable alteration of the surrounding phenomena would still\nbe perceived; the most abstruse demonstration in this room would\nnot prevent a listener, however absorbed, from noticing the sudden\nextinction of the lights. Our mental states have always an _essential\nunity_, such that each state of apprehension, however variously\ncompounded, is a single whole, of which every component is, therefore,\nstrictly apprehended (so far as it is apprehended) as a part. Such\nis the elementary basis from which all our intellectual operations\ncommence.\"\n[228] Compare the charming passage in Taine on Intelligence (N. Y.\ned.), i, 83-4.\n[229] E.g.: \"The stream of thought is not a continuous current, but a\nseries of distinct ideas, more or less rapid in their succession; the\nrapidity being measurable by the number that pass through the mind in a\ngiven time.\" (Bain: E. and W., p. 29.)\n[230] Few writers have admitted that we cognize relations through\nfeeling. The intellectualists have explicitly denied the possibility of\nsuch a thing--e.g., Prof. T. H. Green ('Mind,' vol. vii, p. 28): \"No\nfeeling, as such or as felt, is [of?] a relation.... Even a relation\nbetween feelings is not itself a feeling or felt.\" On the other hand,\nthe sensationists have either smuggled in the cognition without giving\nany account of it, or have denied the relations to be cognized, or\neven to exist, at all. A few honorable exceptions, however, deserve\nto be named among the sensationists. Destutt de Tracy, Laromigui\u00e8re,\nCardaillac, Brown, and finally Spencer, have explicitly contended for\nfeelings of relation, consubstantial with our feelings or thoughts\nof the terms 'between' which they obtain. Thus Destutt de Tracy says\n(\u00c9l\u00e9ments d'Id\u00e9ologie, T. Ier, chap. iv): \"The faculty of judgment\nis itself a sort of sensibility, for it is the faculty of feeling\nthe relations among our ideas; and to feel relations is to feel.\"\nLaromigui\u00e8re writes (Le\u00e7ons de Philosophie, IIme Partie, 3me Le\u00e7on):\n\"There is no one whose intelligence does not embrace simultaneously\nmany ideas, more or less distinct, more or less confused. Now, when\nwe have many ideas at once, a peculiar feeling arises in us: we feel,\namong these ideas, resemblances, differences, relations. Let us call\nthis mode of feeling, common to us all, the feeling of relation,\nor relation-feeling (_sentiment-rapport_). One sees immediately\nthat these relation-feelings, resulting from the propinquity of\nideas, must be infinitely more numerous than the sensation-feelings\n(_sentiments-sensations_) or the feelings we have of the action of\nour faculties. The slightest knowledge of the mathematical theory of\ncombinations will prove this.... _Ideas_ of relation originate in\nfeelings of relation. They are the effect of our comparing them and\nreasoning about them.\"\nSimilarly, de Cardaillac (\u00c9tudes \u00c9l\u00e9mentaires de Philosophie, Section\ni, chap. vii):\n\"By a natural consequence, we are led to suppose that at the same time\nthat we have several sensations or several ideas in the mind, we feel\nthe relations which exist between these sensations, and the relations\nwhich exist between these ideas.... If the feeling of relations exists\nin us,... it is necessarily the most varied and the most fertile of\nall human feelings: 1\u00b0, the most varied, because, relations being more\nnumerous than beings, the feelings of relation must be in the same\nproportion more numerous than the sensations whose presence gives rise\nto their formation; 2\u00b0, the most fertile, for the relative ideas of\nwhich the feeling-of-relation is the source ... are more important\nthan absolute ideas, if such exist.... If we interrogate common\nspeech, we find the feeling of relation expressed there in a thousand\ndifferent ways. If it is easy to seize a relation, we say that it is\n_sensible_, to distinguish it from one which, because its terms are\ntoo remote, cannot be as quickly perceived. A sensible difference,\nor resemblance.... What is taste in the arts, in intellectual\nproductions? What but the feeling of those relations among the parts\nwhich constitutes their merit?... Did we not feel relations we should\nnever attain to true knowledge,... for almost all our knowledge is of\nrelations.... We never have an isolated sensation;... we are therefore\nnever without the feeling of relation.... An _object_ strikes our\nsenses; we see in it only a sensation.... The relative is so near the\nabsolute, the relation-feeling so near the sensation-feeling, the two\nare so intimately fused in the composition of the object, that the\nrelation appears to us as part of the sensation itself. It is doubtless\nto this sort of fusion between sensations and feelings of relation that\nthe silence of metaphysicians as to the latter is due; and it is for\nthe same reason that they have obstinately persisted in asking from\nsensation alone those ideas of relation which it was powerless to give.\"\nDr. Thomas Brown writes (Lectures, xlv, _init._): \"There is an\nextensive order of our feelings which involve this notion of relation,\nand which consist indeed in the mere perception of a relation of some\nsort.... Whether the relation be of two or of many external objects, or\nof two or many affections of the mind, the feeling of this relation ...\nis what I term a relative suggestion; that phrase being the simplest\nwhich it is possible to employ, for expressing, without any theory, the\nmere fact of the rise of certain feelings of relation, after certain\nother feelings which precede them; and therefore, as involving no\nparticular theory, and simply expressive of an undoubted fact.... That\nthe feelings of relation are states of the mind essentially different\nfrom our simple perceptions, or conceptions of the objects,... that\nthey are not what Condillac terms _transformed sensations_, I proved\nin a former lecture, when I combated the excessive simplification of\nthat ingenious but not very accurate philosopher. There is an original\ntendency or susceptibility of the mind, by which, on perceiving\ntogether different objects, we are instantly, without the intervention\nof any other mental process, sensible of their relation in certain\nrespects, as truly as there is an original tendency or susceptibility\nby which, when external objects are present and have produced a certain\naffection of our sensorial organ, we are instantly affected with the\nprimary elementary feelings of perception; and, I may add, that as\nour sensations or perceptions are of various species, so are there\nvarious species of relations;--the number of relations, indeed, even of\nexternal things, being almost infinite, while the number of perceptions\nis, necessarily, limited by that of the objects which have the power of\nproducing some affection of our organs of sensation.... Without that\nsusceptibility of the mind by which it has the feeling of relation, our\nconsciousness would be as truly limited to a single point, as our body\nwould become, were it possible to fetter it to a single atom.\"\nMr. Spencer is even more explicit. His philosophy is crude in that he\nseems to suppose that it is only in transitive states that outward\nrelations are known; whereas in truth space-relations, relations\nof contrast, etc., are felt along with their terms, in substantive\nstates as well as in transitive states, as we shall abundantly see.\nNevertheless Mr. Spencer's passage is so clear that it also deserves to\nbe quoted in full (Principles of Psychology, \u00a7 65):\n\"The proximate components of Mind are of two broadly-contrasted\nkinds--Feelings and the relations between feelings. Among the members\nof each group there exist multitudinous unlikenesses, many of which are\nextremely strong; but such unlikenesses are small compared with those\nwhich distinguish members of the one group from members of the other.\nLet us, in the first place, consider what are the characters which\nall Feelings have in common, and what are the characters which all\nRelations between feelings have in common.\n\"Each feeling, as we here define it, is any portion of consciousness\nwhich occupies a place sufficiently large to give it a perceivable\nindividuality; which has its individuality marked off from adjacent\nportions of consciousness by qualitative contrasts; and which, when\nintrospectively contemplated, appears to be homogeneous. These are the\nessentials. Obviously if, under introspection, a state of consciousness\nis decomposable into unlike parts that exist either simultaneously or\nsuccessively, it is not one feeling but two or more. Obviously if it is\nindistinguishable from an adjacent portion of consciousness, it forms\none with that portion--is not an individual feeling, but part of one.\nAnd obviously if it does not occupy in consciousness an appreciable\narea, or an appreciable duration, it cannot be known as a feeling.\n\"A Relation between feelings is, on the contrary, characterized by\noccupying no appreciable part of consciousness. Take away the terms\nit unites, and it disappears along with them; having no independent\nplace, no individuality of its own. It is true that, under an ultimate\nanalysis, what we call a relation proves to be itself a kind of\nfeeling--the momentary feeling accompanying the transition from\none conspicuous feeling to an adjacent conspicuous feeling. And it\nis true that, notwithstanding its extreme brevity, its qualitative\ncharacter is appreciable; for relations are (as we shall hereafter\nsee) distinguishable from one another only by the unlikenesses of the\nfeelings which accompany the momentary transitions. Each relational\nfeeling may, in fact, be regarded as one of those nervous shocks\nwhich we suspect to be the units of composition of feelings; and,\nthough instantaneous, it is known as of greater or less strength,\nand as taking place with greater or less facility. But the contrast\nbetween these relational feelings and what we ordinarily call feelings\nis so strong that we must class them apart. Their extreme brevity,\ntheir small variety, and their dependence on the terms they unite,\ndifferentiate them in an unmistakable way.\n\"Perhaps it will be well to recognize more fully the truth that this\ndistinction cannot be absolute. Besides admitting that, as an element\nof consciousness, a relation is a momentary feeling, we must also\nadmit that just as a relation can have no existence apart from the\nfeelings which form its terms, so a feeling can exist only by relations\nto other feelings which limit it in space or time or both. Strictly\nspeaking, neither a feeling nor a relation is an independent element\nof consciousness: there is throughout a dependence such that the\nappreciable areas of consciousness occupied by feelings can no more\npossess individualities apart from the relations which link them, than\nthese relations can possess individualities apart from the feelings\nthey link. The essential distinction between the two, then, appears\nto be that whereas a relational feeling is a portion of consciousness\ninseparable into parts, a feeling, ordinarily so called, is a portion\nof consciousness that admits imaginary division into like parts which\nare related to one another in sequence or coexistence. A feeling proper\nis either made up of like parts that occupy time, or it is made up of\nlike parts that occupy space, or both. In any case, a feeling proper\nis an aggregate of related like parts, while a relational feeling is\nundecomposable. And this is exactly the contrast between the two which\nmust result if, as we have inferred, feelings are composed of units of\nfeelings, or shocks.\"\n[231] M. Paulhan (Revue Philosophique, xx, 455-6), after speaking\nof the faint mental images of objects and emotions, says: \"We find\nother vaguer states still, upon which attention seldom rests, except\nin persons who by nature or profession are addicted to internal\nobservation. It is even difficult to name them precisely, for they\nare little known and not classed; but we may cite as an example of\nthem that peculiar impression which we feel when, strongly preoccupied\nby a certain subject, we nevertheless are engaged with, and have our\nattention almost completely absorbed by, matters quite disconnected\ntherewithal. We do not then exactly think of the object of our\npreoccupation; we do not represent it in a clear manner; and yet our\nmind is not as it would be without this preoccupation. Its object,\nabsent from consciousness, is nevertheless represented there by a\npeculiar unmistakable impression, which often persists long and is a\nstrong feeling, although so obscure for our intelligence.\" \"A mental\nsign of the kind is the unfavorable disposition left in our mind\ntowards an individual by painful incidents erewhile experienced and\nnow perhaps forgotten. The sign remains, but is not understood; its\ndefinite meaning is lost.\" (P. 458.)\n[232] Mozart describes thus his manner of composing: First bits and\ncrumbs of the piece come and gradually join together in his mind;\nthen the soul getting warmed to the work, the thing grows more and\nmore, \"and I spread it out broader and clearer, and at last it gets\nalmost finished in my head, even when it is a long piece, so that I\ncan see the whole of it at a single glance in my mind, as if it were\na beautiful painting or a handsome human being; in which way I do not\nhear it in my imagination at all as a succession--the way it must\ncome later--but all at once, as it were. If is a rare feast! All the\ninventing and making goes on in me as in a beautiful strong dream. But\nthe best of all is the _hearing of it all at once_.\"\n[233] Mental Physiology, \u00a7 236. Dr. Carpenter's explanation differs\nmaterially from that given in the text.\n[234] Cf. also S. Stricker: Vorlesungen \u00fcber allg. u. exp. Pathologie\n(1879), pp. 462-3, 501, 547; Romanes: Origin of Human Faculty, p.\n82. It is so hard to make one's self clear that I may advert to a\nmisunderstanding of my views by the late Prof. Thos. Maguire of Dublin\n(Lectures on Philosophy, 1885). This author considers that by the\n'fringe' I mean some sort of psychic material by which sensations in\nthemselves separate are made to cohere together, and wittily says that\nI ought to \"see that uniting sensations by their 'fringes' is more\nvague than to construct the universe out of oysters by platting their\nbeards\" (p. 211). But the fringe, as I use the word, means nothing like\nthis; it is part of the _object cognized_,--substantive _qualities_\nand _things_ appearing to the mind in a _fringe of relations_.\nSome parts--the transitive parts--of our stream of thought cognize\nthe relations rather than the things; but both the transitive and\nthe substantive parts form one continuous stream, with no discrete\n'sensations' in it such as Prof. Maguire supposes, and supposes me to\nsuppose, to be there.\n[235] George Campbell: Philosophy of Rhetoric, book ii, chap. vii.\n[236] Substantialism or Philosophy of Knowledge, by 'Jean Story' (1879).\n[237] M. G. Tarde, quoting (in Delb\u0153uf, Le Sommeil et les R\u00eaves (1885),\np. 226) some nonsense-verses from a dream, says they show \"how prosodic\nforms may subsist in a mind from which logical rules are effaced....\nI was able, in dreaming, to preserve the faculty of finding two words\nwhich rhymed, to appreciate the rhyme, to fill up the verse as it first\npresented itself with other words which, added, gave the right number\nof syllables, and yet I was ignorant of the sense of the words....\nThus we have the extraordinary fact that the words called each other\nup, without calling up their sense.... Even when awake, it is more\ndifficult to ascend to the meaning of a word than to pass from one word\nto another; or to put it otherwise, _it is harder to be a thinker than\nto be a rhetorician_, and on the whole nothing is commoner than trains\nof words not understood.\"\n[238] We think it odd that young children should listen with such rapt\nattention to the reading of stories expressed in words half of which\nthey do not understand, and of none of which they ask the meaning. But\ntheir thinking is in form just what ours is when it is rapid. Both\nof us make flying leaps over large portions of the sentences uttered\nand we give attention only to substantive starting points, turning\npoints, and conclusions here and there. All the rest, 'substantive' and\nseparately intelligible as it may _potentially_ be, actually serves\nonly as so much transitive material. It is _internodal_ consciousness,\ngiving us the sense of continuity, but having no significance apart\nfrom its mere gap-filling function. The children probably feel no gap\nwhen through a lot of unintelligible words they are swiftly carried to\na familiar and intelligible terminus.\n[239] Not literally _heard_, of course. Deaf mutes are quick to\nperceive shocks and jars that can be felt, even when so slight as to be\nunnoticed by those who can hear.\n[240] Quoted by Samuel Porter: 'Is Thought possible without Language?'\nin Princeton Review, 57th year, pp. 108-12 (Jan. 1881?).

Semi-weekly\nEvening Post for Nov. 2, 1886.\n[245] In half-stunned states self-consciousness may lapse. A friend\nwrites me: \"We were driving back from ---- in a wagonette. The door\nflew open and X., alias 'Baldy,' fell out on the road. We pulled up at\nonce, and then he said, 'Did anybody fall out?' or 'Who fell out?'--I\ndon't exactly remember the words. When told that Baldy fell out, he\nsaid, 'Did Baldy fall out? Poor Baldy!'\"\n[246] Kant originated this view. I subjoin a few English statements of\nit. J. Ferrier, Institutes of Metaphysic, Proposition i: \"Along with\nwhatever any intelligence knows it must, as the ground or condition\nof its knowledge, have some knowledge of itself.\" Sir Wm. Hamilton,\nDiscussions, p. 47: \"We know, and we know that we know,--these\npropositions, logically distinct, are really identical; each implies\nthe other.... So true is the scholastic brocard: _non sentimus nisi\nsentiamus nos sentire_.\" H. L. Mansel, Metaphysics, p. 58: \"Whatever\nvariety of materials may exist within reach of my mind, I can become\nconscious of them only by recognizing them as mine.... Relation to\nthe conscious self is thus the permanent and universal feature which\nevery state of consciousness as such must exhibit.\" T. H. Green,\nIntroduction to Hume, p. 12: \"A consciousness by the man ... of\nhimself, in negative relation to the thing that is his object, and this\nconsciousness must be taken to go along with the perceptive act itself.\nNot less than this indeed can be involved in any act that is to be the\nbeginning of knowledge at all. It is the minimum of possible thought or\nintelligence.\"\n[247] Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind, Lecture 45.\n[248] Instead of saying _to our feeling only_, he should have said, to\nthe _object_ only.\n[249] \"There can be no difficulty in admitting that association does\nform the ideas of an indefinite number of individuals into one complex\nidea; because it is an acknowledged fact. Have we not the idea of an\narmy? And is not that precisely the ideas of an indefinite number of\nmen formed into one idea?\" (Jas. Mill's Analysis of the Human Mind (J.\nS. Mill's Edition), vol. i, p. 264.)\n[250] For their arguments, see above.\n[251] I know there are readers whom nothing can convince that the\nthought of a complex object has not as many parts as are discriminated\nin the object itself. Well, then, let the word parts pass. Only\nobserve that these parts are not the separate 'ideas' of traditional\npsychology. No one of them can live out of that particular thought, any\nmore than my head can live off of my particular shoulders. In a sense a\nsoap-bubble has parts; it is a sum of juxtaposed spherical triangles.\nBut these triangles are not separate realities; neither are the 'parts'\nof the thought separate realities. Touch the bubble and the triangles\nare no more. Dismiss the thought and out go its parts. You can no more\nmake a new thought out of 'ideas' that have once served than you can\nmake a new bubble out of old triangles Each bubble, each thought, is a\nfresh organic unity, _sui generis_.\n[252] In his work, La Parole Int\u00e9rieure (Paris, 1881), especially\nchapters vi and vii.\n[253] Page 301.\n[254] Page 218. To prove this point, M. Egger appeals to the fact that\nwe often hear some one speak whilst our mind is preoccupied, but do\nnot understand him until some moments afterwards, when we suddenly\n'realize' what he meant. Also to our digging out the meaning of a\nsentence in an unfamiliar tongue, where the words are present to us\nlong before the idea is taken in. In these special cases the word\ndoes indeed precede the idea. The idea, on the contrary, precedes\nthe word whenever we try to express ourselves with effort, as in a\nforeign tongue, or in an unusual field of intellectual invention. Both\nsets of cases, however, are exceptional, and M. Egger would probably\nhimself admit, on reflection, that in the former class there is some\nsort of a verbal suffusion, however evanescent, of the idea, when it\nis grasped--we hear the echo of the words as we catch their meaning.\nAnd he would probably admit that in the second class of cases the idea\npersists after the words that came with so much effort are found. In\nnormal cases the simultaneity, as he admits, is obviously there.\n[255] A good way to get the words and the sense separately is to\ninwardly articulate word for word the discourse of another. One then\nfinds that the meaning will often come to the mind in pulses, after\nclauses or sentences are finished.\n[256] The nearest approach (with which I am acquainted) to the doctrine\nset forth here is in O. Liebmaun's Zur Analysis der Wirklichkeit, pp.\n427-438.\nCHAPTER X.\nTHE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SELF.\nLet us begin with the Self in its widest acceptation, and follow it up\nto its most delicate and subtle form, advancing from the study of the\nempirical, as the Germans call it, to that of the pure, Ego.\nTHE EMPIRICAL SELF OR ME.\nThe Empirical Self of each of us is all that he is tempted to call by\nthe name of _me_. But it is clear that between what a man calls _me_\nand what he simply calls _mine_ the line is difficult to draw. We feel\nand act about certain things that are ours very much as we feel and act\nabout ourselves. Our fame, our children, the work of our hands, may\nbe as dear to us as our bodies are, and arouse the same feelings and\nthe same acts of reprisal if attacked. And our bodies themselves, are\nthey simply ours, or are they _us_? Certainly men have been ready to\ndisown their very bodies and to regard them as mere vestures, or even\nas prisons of clay from which they should some day be glad to escape.\nWe see then that we are dealing with a fluctuating material. The\nsame object being sometimes treated as a part of me, at other times\nas simply mine, and then again as if I had nothing to do with it at\nall. _In its widest possible sense_, however, _a man's Self is the\nsum total of all that he_ CAN _call his_, not only his body and his\npsychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children,\nhis ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and\nhorses, and yacht and bank-account. All these things give him the same\nemotions. If they wax and prosper, he feels triumphant; if they dwindle\nand die away, he feels cast down,--not necessarily in the same degree\nfor each thing, but in much the same way for all. Understanding the\nSelf in this widest sense, we may begin by dividing the history of it\ninto three parts, relating respectively to--\n1. Its constituents;\n2. The feelings and emotions they arouse,--_Self-feelings;_\n3. The actions to which they prompt,--_Self-seeking and\nSelf-preservation._\n*       *       *       *       *\n1. _The constituents of the Self_ may be divided into two classes,\nthose which make up respectively--\n(_a_) The material Self;\n(_b_) The social Self;\n(_c_) The spiritual Self; and\n(_d_) The pure Ego.\n(_a_) The body is the innermost part of _the material Self_ in each of\nus; and certain parts of the body seem more intimately ours than the\nrest. The clothes come next. The old saying that the human person is\ncomposed of three parts--soul, body and clothes--is more than a joke.\nWe so appropriate our clothes and identify ourselves with them that\nthere are few of us who, if asked to choose between having a beautiful\nbody clad in raiment perpetually shabby and unclean, and having an ugly\nand blemished form always spotlessly attired, would not hesitate a\nmoment before making a decisive reply.[257] Next, our immediate family\nis a part of ourselves. Our father and mother, our wife and babes, are\nbone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. When they die, a part of our\nvery selves is gone. If they do anything wrong, it is our shame. If\nthey are insulted, our anger flashes forth as readily as if we stood\nin their place. Our home comes next. Its scenes are part of our life;\nits aspects awaken the tenderest feelings of affection; and we do not\neasily forgive the stranger who, in visiting it, finds fault with its\narrangements or treats it with contempt. All these different things are\nthe objects of instinctive preferences coupled with the most important\npractical interests of life. We all have a blind impulse to watch over\nour body, to deck it with clothing of an ornamental sort, to cherish\nparents, wife and babes, and to find for ourselves a home of our own\nwhich we may live in and 'improve.'\nAn equally instinctive impulse drives us to collect property; and the\ncollections thus made become, with different degrees of intimacy, parts\nof our empirical selves. The parts of our wealth most intimately ours\nare those which are saturated with our labor. There are few men who\nwould not feel personally annihilated if a life-long construction of\ntheir hands or brains--say an entomological collection or an extensive\nwork in manuscript--were suddenly swept away. The miser feels similarly\ntowards his gold, and although it is true that a part of our depression\nat the loss of possessions is due to our feeling that we must now go\nwithout certain goods that we expected the possessions to bring in\ntheir train, yet in every case there remains, over and above this,\na sense of the shrinkage of our personality, a partial conversion\nof ourselves to nothingness, which is a psychological phenomenon by\nitself. We are all at once assimilated to the tramps and poor devils\nwhom we so despise, and at the same time removed farther than ever away\nfrom the happy sons of earth who lord it over land and sea and men in\nthe full-blown lustihood that wealth and power can give, and before\nwhom, stiffen ourselves as we will by appealing to anti-snobbish first\nprinciples, we cannot escape an emotion, open or sneaking, of respect\nand dread.\n*       *       *       *       *\n(_b_) _A man's Social Self_ is the recognition which he gets from his\nmates. We are not only gregarious animals, liking to be in sight of our\nfellows, but we have an innate propensity to get ourselves noticed, and\nnoticed favorably, by our kind. No more fiendish punishment could be\ndevised, were such a thing physically possible, than that one should\nbe turned loose in society and remain absolutely unnoticed by all the\nmembers thereof. If no one turned round when we entered, answered when\nwe spoke, or minded what we did, but if every person we met 'cut us\ndead,' and acted as if we were non-existing things, a kind of rage\nand impotent despair would ere long well up in us, from which the\ncruellest bodily tortures would be a relief; for these would make us\nfeel that, however bad might be our plight, we had not sunk to such a\ndepth as to be unworthy of attention at all.\nProperly speaking, _a man has as many social selves as there are\nindividuals who recognize him_ and carry an image of him in their\nmind. To wound any one of these his images is to wound him.[258] But\nas the individuals who carry the images fall naturally into classes,\nwe may practically say that he has as many different social selves\nas there are distinct _groups_ of persons about whose opinion he\ncares. He generally shows a different side of himself to each of these\ndifferent groups. Many a youth who is demure enough before his parents\nand teachers, swears and swaggers like a pirate among his 'tough'\nyoung friends. We do not show ourselves to our children as to our\nclub-companions, to our customers as to the laborers we employ, to our\nown masters and employers as to our intimate friends. From this there\nresults what practically is a division of the man into several selves;\nand this may be a discordant splitting, as where one is afraid to let\none set of his acquaintances know him as he is elsewhere; or it may be\na perfectly harmonious division of labor, as where one tender to his\nchildren is stern to the soldiers or prisoners under his command.\nThe most peculiar social self which one is apt to have is in the mind\nof the person one is in love with. The good or bad fortunes of this\nself cause the most intense elation and dejection--unreasonable enough\nas measured by every other standard than that of the organic feeling\nof the individual. To his own consciousness he _is_ not, so long as\nthis particular social self fails to get recognition, and when it is\nrecognized his contentment passes all bounds.\nA man's _fame_, good or bad, and his _honor_ or dishonor, are names for\none of his social selves. The particular social self of a man called\nhis honor is usually the result of one of those splittings of which\nwe have spoken. It is his image in the eyes of his own 'set,' which\nexalts or condemns him as he conforms or not to certain requirements\nthat may not be made of one in another walk of life. Thus a layman\nmay abandon a city infected with cholera; but a priest or a doctor\nwould think such an act incompatible with his honor. A soldier's honor\nrequires him to fight or to die under circumstances where another man\ncan apologize or run away with no stain upon his social self. A judge,\na statesman, are in like manner debarred by the honor of their cloth\nfrom entering into pecuniary relations perfectly honorable to persons\nin private life. Nothing is commoner than to hear people discriminate\nbetween their different selves of this sort: \"As a man I pity you, but\nas an official I must show you no mercy; as a politician I regard him\nas an ally, but as a moralist I loathe him;\" etc., etc. What may be\ncalled 'club-opinion' is one of the very strongest forces in life.[259]\nThe thief must not steal from other thieves; the gambler must pay his\ngambling-debts, though he pay no other debts in the world. The code\nof honor of fashionable society has throughout history been full of\npermissions as well as of vetoes, the only reason for following either\nof which is that so we best serve one of our social selves. You must\nnot lie in general, but you may lie as much as you please if asked\nabout your relations with a lady; you must accept a challenge from an\nequal, but if challenged by an inferior you may laugh him to scorn:\nthese are examples of what is meant.\n*       *       *       *       *\n(_c_) By the Spiritual Self, so far as it belongs to the Empirical\nMe, I mean a man's inner or subjective being, his psychic faculties\nor dispositions, taken concretely; not the bare principle of\npersonal Unity, or 'pure' Ego, which remains still to be discussed.\nThese psychic dispositions are the most enduring and intimate\npart of the self, that which we most verily seem to be. We take\na purer self-satisfaction when we think of our ability to argue\nand discriminate, of our moral sensibility and conscience, of our\nindomitable will, than when we survey any of our other possessions.\nOnly when these are altered is a man said to be _alienatus a se_.\nNow this spiritual self may be considered in various ways. We may\ndivide it into faculties, as just instanced, isolating them one from\nanother, and identifying ourselves with either in turn. This is an\n_abstract_ way of dealing with consciousness, in which, as it actually\npresents itself, a plurality of such faculties are always to be\nsimultaneously found; or we may insist on a concrete view, and then the\nspiritual self in us will be either the entire stream of our personal\nconsciousness, or the present 'segment' or 'section' of that stream,\naccording as we take a broader or a narrower view--both the stream and\nthe section being concrete existences in time, and each being a unity\nafter its own peculiar kind. But whether we take it abstractly or\nconcretely, our considering the spiritual self at all is a reflective\nprocess, is the result of our abandoning the outward-looking point of\nview, and of our having become able to think of subjectivity as such,\n_to think ourselves as thinkers_.\nThis attention to thought as such, and the identification of ourselves\nwith it rather than with any of the objects which it reveals, is a\nmomentous and in some respects a rather mysterious operation, of which\nwe need here only say that as a matter of fact it exists; and that in\neveryone, at an early age, the distinction between thought as such,\nand what it is 'of' or 'about,' has become familiar to the mind. The\ndeeper grounds for this discrimination may possibly be hard to find;\nbut superficial grounds are plenty and near at hand. Almost anyone will\ntell us that thought is a different sort of existence from things,\nbecause many sorts of thought are of no things--e.g., pleasures, pains,\nand emotions; others are of non-existent things--errors and fictions;\nothers again of existent things, but in a form that is symbolic\nand does not resemble them--abstract ideas and concepts; whilst in\nthe thoughts that do resemble the things they are 'of' (percepts,\nsensations), we can feel, alongside of the thing known, the thought of\nit going on as an altogether separate act and operation in the mind.\nNow this subjective life of ours, distinguished as such so clearly\nfrom the objects known by its means, may, as aforesaid, be taken by\nus in a concrete or in an abstract way. Of the concrete way I will\nsay nothing just now, except that the actual 'section' of the stream\nwill ere long, in our discussion of the nature of the principle of\n_unity_ in consciousness, play a very important part. The abstract way\nclaims our attention first. If the stream as a whole is identified\nwith the Self far more than any outward thing, a _certain portion of\nthe stream abstracted from the rest_ is so identified in an altogether\npeculiar degree, and is felt by all men as a sort of innermost centre\nwithin the circle, of sanctuary within the citadel, constituted by the\nsubjective life as a whole. Compared with this element of the stream,\nthe other parts, even of the subjective life, seem transient external\npossessions, of which each in turn can be disowned, whilst that which\ndisowns them remains. Now, _what is this self of all the other selves?_\nProbably all men would describe it in much the same way up to a certain\npoint. They would call it the _active_ element in all consciousness;\nsaying that whatever qualities a man's feelings may possess, or\nwhatever content his thought may include, there is a spiritual\nsomething in him which seems to _go out_ to meet these qualities\nand contents, whilst they seem to _come in_ to be received by it.\nIt is what welcomes or rejects. It presides over the perception of\nsensations, and by giving or withholding its assent it influences the\nmovements they tend to arouse. It is the home of interest,--not the\npleasant or the painful, not even pleasure or pain, as such, but that\nwithin us to which pleasure and pain, the pleasant and the painful,\nspeak. It is the source of effort and attention, and the place from\nwhich appear to emanate the fiats of the will. A physiologist who\nshould reflect upon it in his own person could hardly help, I should\nthink, connecting it more or less vaguely with the process by which\nideas or incoming sensations are 'reflected' or pass over into outward\nacts. Not necessarily that it should _be_ this process or the mere\nfeeling of this process, but that it should be in some close way\n_related_ to this process; for it plays a part analogous to it in the\npsychic life, being a sort of junction at which sensory ideas terminate\nand from which motor ideas proceed, and forming a kind of link between\nthe two. Being more incessantly there than any other single element of\nthe mental life, the other elements end by seeming to accrete round\nit and to belong to it. It become opposed to them as the permanent is\nopposed to the changing and inconstant.\nOne may, I think, without fear of being upset by any future Galtonian\ncirculars, believe that all men must single out from the rest of\nwhat they call themselves some central principle of which each would\nrecognize the foregoing to be a fair general description,--accurate\nenough, at any rate, to denote what is meant, and keep it unconfused\nwith other things. The moment, however, they came to closer quarters\nwith it, trying to define more accurately its precise nature, we\nshould find opinions beginning to diverge. Some would say that it is a\nsimple active substance, the soul, of which they are thus conscious;\nothers, that it is nothing but a fiction, the imaginary being denoted\nby the pronoun I; and between these extremes of opinion all sorts of\nintermediaries would be found.\nLater we must ourselves discuss them all, and sufficient to that day\nwill be the evil thereof. _Now_, let us try to settle for ourselves\nas definitely as we can, just how this central nucleus of the Self\nmay _feel_, no matter whether it be a spiritual substance or only a\ndelusive word.\nFor this central part of the Self is _felt_. It may be all that\nTranscendentalists say it is, and all that Empiricists say it is into\nthe bargain, but it is at any rate no _mere ens rationis_, cognized\nonly in an intellectual way, and no _mere_ summation of memories or\n_mere_ sound of a word in our ears. It is something with which we also\nhave direct sensible acquaintance, and which is as fully present at\nany moment of consciousness in which it _is_ present, as in a whole\nlifetime of such moments. When, just now, it was called an abstraction,\nthat did not mean that, like some general notion, it could not be\npresented in a particular experience. It only meant that in the stream\nof consciousness it never was found all alone. But when it is found,\nit is _felt_; just as the body is felt, the feeling of which is also\nan abstraction, because never is the body felt all alone, but always\ntogether with other things. _Now can we tell more precisely in what the\nfeeling of this central active self consists,_--not necessarily as yet\nwhat the active self _is_, as a being or principle, but what we _feel_\nwhen we become aware of its existence?\nI think I can in my own case; and as what I say will be likely to\nmeet with opposition if generalized (as indeed it may be in part\ninapplicable to other individuals), I had better continue in the\nfirst person, leaving my description, to be accepted by those to\nwhose introspection it may commend itself as true, and confessing my\ninability to meet the demands of others, if others there be.\nFirst of all, I am aware of a constant play of furtherances and\nhindrances in my thinking, of checks and releases, tendencies which\nrun with desire, and tendencies which run the other way. Among the\nmatters I think of, some range themselves on the side of the thought's\ninterests, whilst others play an unfriendly part thereto. The mutual\ninconsistencies and agreements, reinforcements and obstructions, which\nobtain amongst these objective matters reverberate backwards and\nproduce what seem to be incessant reactions of my spontaneity upon\nthem, welcoming or opposing, appropriating or disowning, striving with\nor against, saying yes or no. This palpitating inward life is, in me,\nthat central nucleus which I just tried to describe in terms that all\nmen might use.\nBut when I forsake such general descriptions and grapple with\nparticulars, coming to the closest possible quarters with the\nfacts, _it is difficult for me to detect in the activity any purely\nspiritual element at all. Whenever my introspective glance succeeds in\nturning round quickly enough to catch one of these manifestations of\nspontaneity in the act, all it can ever feel distinctly is some bodily\nprocess, for the most part taking place within the head._ Omitting for\na moment what is obscure in these introspective results, let me try to\nstate those particulars which to my own consciousness seem indubitable\nand distinct.\nIn the first place, the acts of attending, assenting, negating, making\nan effort, are felt as movements of something in the head. In many\ncases it is possible to describe these movements quite exactly. In\nattending to either an idea or a sensation belonging to a particular\nsense-sphere, the movement is the adjustment of the sense-organ, felt\nas it occurs. I cannot think in visual terms, for example, without\nfeeling a fluctuating play of pressures, convergences, divergences,\nand accommodations in my eyeballs. The direction in which the object\nis conceived to lie determines the character of these movements, the\nfeeling of which becomes, for my consciousness, identified with the\nmanner in which I make myself ready to receive the visible thing. My\nbrain appears to me as if all shot across with lines of direction, of\nwhich I have become conscious as my attention has shifted from one\nsense-organ to another, in passing to successive outer things, or in\nfollowing trains of varying sense-ideas.\nWhen I try to remember or reflect, the movements in question, instead\nof being directed towards the periphery, seem to come from the\nperiphery inwards and feel like a sort of _withdrawal_ from the outer\nworld. As far as I can detect, these feelings are due to an actual\nrolling outwards and upwards of the eyeballs, such as I believe occurs\nin me in sleep, and is the exact opposite of their action in fixating\na physical thing. In reasoning, I find that I am apt to have a kind\nof vaguely localized diagram in my mind, with the various fractional\nobjects of the thought disposed at particular points thereof; and the\noscillations of my attention from one of them to another are most\ndistinctly felt as alternations of direction in movements occurring\ninside the head.[260]\nIn consenting and negating, and in making a mental effort, the\nmovements seem more complex, and I find them harder to describe.\nThe opening and closing of the glottis play a great part in these\noperations, and, less distinctly, the movements of the soft palate,\netc., shutting off the posterior nares from the mouth. My glottis\nis like a sensitive valve, intercepting my breath instantaneously\nat every mental hesitation or felt aversion to the objects of my\nthought, and as quickly opening, to let the air pass through my throat\nand nose, the moment the repugnance is overcome. The feeling of the\nmovement of this air is, in me, one strong ingredient of the feeling\nof assent. The movements of the muscles of the brow and eyelids also\nrespond very sensitively to every fluctuation in the agreeableness or\ndisagreeableness of what comes before my mind.\nIn _effort_ of any sort, contractions of the jaw-muscles and of those\nof respiration are added to those of the brow and glottis, and thus the\nfeeling passes out of the head properly so called. It passes out of the\nhead whenever the welcoming or rejecting of the object is _strongly_\nfelt. Then a set of feelings pour in from many bodily parts, all\n'expressive' of my emotion, and the head-feelings proper are swallowed\nup in this larger mass.\nIn a sense, then, it may be truly said that, in one person at least,\n_the 'Self of selves,' when carefully examined, is found to consist\nmainly of the collection of these peculiar motions in the head or\nbetween the head and throat_. I do not for a moment say that this is\n_all_ it consists of, for I fully realize how desperately hard is\nintrospection in this field. But I feel quite sure that these cephalic\nmotions are the portions of my innermost activity of which I am _most\ndistinctly aware_. If the dim portions which I cannot yet define should\nprove to be like unto these distinct portions in me, and I like other\nmen, _it would follow that our entire feeling of spiritual activity,\nor what commonly passes by that name, is really a feeling of bodily\nactivities whose exact nature is by most men overlooked._\n*       *       *       *       *\nNow, without pledging ourselves in any way to adopt this hypothesis,\nlet us dally with it for a while to see to what consequences it might\nlead if it were true.\nIn the first place, the nuclear part of the Self, intermediary\nbetween ideas and overt acts, would be a collection of activities\nphysiologically in no essential way different from the overt acts\nthemselves. If we divide all possible physiological acts into\n_adjustments_ and _executions_, the nuclear self would be the\nadjustments collectively considered; and the less intimate, more\nshifting self, so far as it was active, would be the executions. But\nboth adjustments and executions would obey the reflex type. Both\nwould be the result of sensorial and ideational processes discharging\neither into each other within the brain, or into muscles and other\nparts outside. The peculiarity of the adjustments would be that they\nare minimal reflexes, few in number, incessantly repeated, constant\namid great fluctuations in the rest of the mind's content, and\nentirely unimportant and uninteresting except through their uses in\nfurthering or inhibiting the presence of various things, and actions\nbefore consciousness. These characters would naturally keep us from\nintrospectively paying much attention to them in detail, whilst they\nwould at the same time make us aware of them as a coherent group of\nprocesses, strongly contrasted with all the other things consciousness\ncontained,--even with the other constituents of the 'Self,' material,\nsocial, or spiritual, as the case might be. They are reactions, and\nthey are _primary_ reactions. Everything arouses them; for objects\nwhich have no other effects will for a moment contract the brow and\nmake the glottis close. It is as if all that visited the mind had to\nstand an entrance-examination, and just show its face so as to be\neither approved or sent back. These primary reactions are like the\nopening or the closing of the door. In the midst of psychic change\nthey are the permanent core of turnings-towards and turnings-from,\nof yieldings and arrests, which naturally seem central and interior\nin comparison with the foreign matters, _a propos_ to which they\noccur, and hold a sort of arbitrating, decisive position, quite unlike\nthat held by any of the other constituents of the Me. It would not\nbe surprising, then, if we were to feel them as the birthplace of\nconclusions and the starting point of acts, or if they came to appear\nas what we called a while back the 'sanctuary within the citadel' of\nour personal life.[261]\nIf they really were the innermost sanctuary, the _ultimate_ one of all\nthe selves whose being we can ever directly experience, it would follow\nthat _all_ that is experienced is, strictly considered, _objective_;\nthat this Objective falls asunder into two contrasted parts, one\nrealized as 'Self,' the other as 'not-Self; 'and that over and above\nthese parts there _is_ nothing save the fact that they are known,\nthe fact of the stream of thought being there as the indispensable\nsubjective condition of their being experienced at all. But this\n_condition_ of the experience is not one of the _things experienced_\nat the moment; this knowing is not immediately _known_. It is only\nknown in subsequent reflection. Instead, then, of the stream of thought\nbeing one of _con_-sciousness, \"thinking its own existence along with\nwhatever else it thinks,\" (as Ferrier says) it might be better called\na stream of _Scious_ness pure and simple, thinking objects of some of\nwhich it makes what it calls a 'Me,' and only aware of its 'pure' Self\nin an abstract, hypothetic or conceptual way. Each 'section' of the\nstream would then be a bit of sciousness or knowledge of this sort,\nincluding and contemplating its 'me' and its 'not-me' as objects which\nwork out their drama together, but not yet including or contemplating\nits own subjective being. The sciousness in question would be the\n_Thinker_, and the existence of this thinker would be given to us\nrather as a logical postulate than as that direct inner perception\nof spiritual activity which we naturally believe ourselves to have.\n'Matter,' as something behind physical phenomena, is a postulate of\nthis sort. Between the postulated Matter and the postulated Thinker,\nthe sheet of phenomena would then swing, some of them (the 'realities')\npertaining more to the matter, others (the fictions, opinions, and\nerrors) pertaining more to the Thinker. But _who_ the Thinker would\nbe, or how many distinct Thinkers we ought to suppose in the universe,\nwould all be subjects for an ulterior metaphysical inquiry.\nSpeculations like this traverse common-sense; and not only do they\ntraverse common sense (which in philosophy is no insuperable objection)\nbut they contradict the fundamental assumption of _every_ philosophic\nschool. Spiritualists, transcendentalists, and empiricists alike admit\nin us a continual direct perception of the thinking activity in the\nconcrete. However they may otherwise disagree, they vie with each other\nin the cordiality of their recognition of our _thoughts_ as the one\nsort of existent which skepticism cannot touch.[262] I will therefore\ntreat the last few pages as a parenthetical digression, and from now to\nthe end of the volume revert to the path of common-sense again. I mean\nby this that I will continue to assume (as I have assumed all along,\nespecially in the last chapter) a direct awareness of the process of\nour thinking as such, simply insisting on the fact that it is an even\nmore inward and subtle phenomenon than most of us suppose. At the\nconclusion of the volume, however, I may permit myself to revert again\nto the doubts here provisionally mooted, and will indulge in some\nmetaphysical reflections suggested by them.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAt present, then, the only conclusion I come to is the following:\nThat (in some persons at least) the part of the innermost Self which\nis most vividly felt turns out to consist for the most part of a\ncollection of cephalic movements of 'adjustments' which, for want of\nattention and reflection, usually fail to be perceived and classed\nas what they are; that over and above these there is an obscurer\nfeeling of something more; but whether it be of fainter physiological\nprocesses, or of nothing objective at all, but rather of subjectivity\nas such, of thought become 'its own object,' must at present remain an\nopen question,--like the question whether it be an indivisible active\nsoul-substance, or the question whether it be a personification of the\npronoun I, or any other of the guesses as to what its nature may be.\nFarther than this we cannot as yet go clearly in our analysis of the\nSelf's constituents. So let us proceed to the emotions of Self which\nthey arouse.\n2. SELF-FEELING.\nThese are primarily _self-complacency_ and _self-dissatisfaction_. Of\nwhat is called 'self-love,' I will treat a little farther on. Language\nhas synonyms enough for both primary feelings. Thus pride, conceit,\nvanity, self-esteem, arrogance, vainglory, on the one hand; and on the\nother modesty, humility, confusion, diffidence, shame, mortification,\ncontrition, the sense of obloquy and personal despair. These two\nopposite classes of affection seem to be direct and elementary\nendowments of our nature. Associationists would have it that they are,\non the other hand, secondary phenomena arising from a rapid computation\nof the sensible pleasures or pains to which our prosperous or debased\npersonal predicament is likely to lead, the sum of the represented\npleasures forming the self-satisfaction, and the sum of the represented\npains forming the opposite feeling of shame. No doubt, when we are\nself-satisfied, we do fondly rehearse all possible rewards for our\ndesert, and when in a fit of self-despair we forebode evil. But the\nmere expectation of reward _is_ not the self-satisfaction, and the mere\napprehension of the evil _is_ not the self-despair, for there is a\ncertain average tone of self-feeling which each one of us carries about\nwith him, and which is independent of the objective reasons we may have\nfor satisfaction or discontent. That is, a very meanly-conditioned man\nmay abound in unfaltering conceit, and one whose success in life is\nsecure and who is esteemed by all may remain diffident of his powers to\nthe end.\nOne may say, however, that the normal _provocative_ of self-feeling is\none's actual success or failure, and the good or bad actual position\none holds in the world. \"He put in his thumb and pulled out a plum, and\nsaid what a good boy am I.\" A man with a broadly extended empirical\nEgo, with powers that have uniformly brought him success, with place\nand wealth and friends and fame, is not likely to be visited by the\nmorbid diffidences and doubts about himself which he had when he was a\nboy. \"Is not this great Babylon, which I have planted?\"[263] Whereas\nhe who has made one blunder after another, and still lies in middle\nlife among the failures at the foot of the hill, is liable to grow all\nsicklied o'er with self-distrust, and to shrink from trials with which\nhis powers can really cope.\nThe emotions themselves of self-satisfaction and abasement are of a\nunique sort, each as worthy to be classed as a primitive emotional\nspecies as are, for example, rage or pain. Each has its own peculiar\nphysiognomical expression. In self-satisfaction the extensor muscles\nare innervated, the eye is strong and glorious, the gait rolling and\nelastic, the nostril dilated, and a peculiar smile plays upon the lips.\nThis whole complex of symptoms is seen in an exquisite way in lunatic\nasylums, which always contain some patients who are literally mad\nwith conceit, and whose fatuous expression and absurdly strutting or\nswaggering gait is in tragic contrast with their lack of any valuable\npersonal quality. It is in these same castles of despair that we find\nthe strongest examples of the opposite physiognomy, in good people who\nthink they have committed 'the unpardonable sin' and are lost forever,\nwho crouch and cringe and slink from notice, and are unable to speak\naloud or look us in the eye. Like fear and like anger, in similar\nmorbid conditions, these opposite feelings of Self may be aroused with\nno adequate exciting cause. And in fact we ourselves know how the\nbarometer of our self-esteem and confidence rises and falls from one\nday to another through causes that seem to be visceral and organic\nrather than rational, and which certainly answer to no corresponding\nvariations in the esteem in which we are held by our friends. Of the\norigin of these emotions in the race, we can speak better when we have\ntreated of--\n3. SELF-SEEKING AND SELF-PRESERVATION.\nThese words cover a large number of our fundamental instinctive\nimpulses. We have those of _bodily self-seeking_, those of _social\nself-seeking_, and those of _spiritual self-seeking_.\nAll the ordinary useful reflex actions and movements of alimentation\nand defence are acts of bodily self-preservation. Fear and anger prompt\nto acts that are useful in the same way. Whilst if by self-seeking we\nmean the providing for the future as distinguished from maintaining\nthe present, we must class both anger and fear with the hunting, the\nacquisitive, the home-constructing and the tool-constructing instincts,\nas impulses to self-seeking of the bodily kind. Really, however, these\nlatter instincts, with amativeness, parental fondness, curiosity and\nemulation, seek not only the development of the bodily Self, but that\nof the material Self in the widest possible sense of the word.\nOur _social self-seeking_, in turn, is carried on directly through\nour amativeness and friendliness, our desire to please and attract\nnotice and admiration, our emulation and jealousy, our love of glory,\ninfluence, and power, and indirectly through whichever of the material\nself-seeking impulses prove serviceable as means to social ends. That\nthe direct social self-seeking impulses are probably pure instincts is\neasily seen. The noteworthy thing about the desire to be 'recognized'\nby others is that its strength has so little to do with the worth of\nthe recognition computed in sensational or rational terms. We are\ncrazy to get a visiting-list which shall be large, to be able to say\nwhen any one is mentioned, \"Oh! I know him well,\" and to be bowed to\nin the street by half the people we meet. Of course distinguished\nfriends and admiring recognition are the most desirable--Thackeray\nsomewhere asks his readers to confess whether it would not give each\nof _them_ an exquisite pleasure to be met walking down Pall Mall with\na duke on either arm. But in default of dukes and envious salutations\nalmost anything will do for some of us; and there is a whole race of\nbeings to-day whose passion is to keep their names in the newspapers,\nno matter under what heading, 'arrivals and departures,' 'personal\nparagraphs,' 'interviews,'--gossip, even scandal, will suit them\nif nothing better is to be had. Guiteau, Garfield's assassin, is\nan example of the extremity to which this sort of craving for the\nnotoriety of print may go in a pathological case. The newspapers\nbounded his mental horizon; and in the poor wretch's prayer on the\nscaffold, one of the most heartfelt expressions was: \"The newspaper\npress of this land has a big bill to settle with thee, O Lord!\"\nNot only the people but the places and things I know enlarge my Self\nin a sort of metaphoric social way. \"_\u00c7a me conna\u00eet_,\" as the French\nworkman says of the implement he can use well. So that it comes about\nthat persons for whose _opinion_ we care nothing are nevertheless\npersons whose notice we woo; and that many a man truly great, many a\nwoman truly fastidious in most respects, will take a deal of trouble\nto dazzle some insignificant cad whose whole personality they heartily\ndespise.\nUnder the head of _spiritual self-seeking_ ought to be included\nevery impulse towards psychic progress, whether intellectual, moral,\nor spiritual in the narrow sense of the term. It must be admitted,\nhowever, that much that commonly passes for spiritual self-seeking\nin this narrow sense is only material and social self-seeking beyond\nthe grave. In the Mohammedan desire for paradise and the Christian\naspiration not to be damned in hell, the materiality of the goods\nsought is undisguised. In the more positive and refined view of heaven\nmany of its goods, the fellowship of the saints and of our dead ones,\nand the presence of God, are but social goods of the most exalted kind.\nIt is only the search of the redeemed inward nature, the spotlessness\nfrom sin, whether here or hereafter, that can count as spiritual\nself-seeking pure and undefined.\nBut this broad external review of the facts of the life of the Self\nwill be incomplete without some account of the\nRIVALRY AND CONFLICT OF THE DIFFERENT SELVES.\nWith most objects of desire, physical nature restricts our choice to\nbut one of many represented goods, and even so it is here. I am often\nconfronted by the necessity of standing by one of my empirical selves\nand relinquishing the rest. Not that I would not, if I could, be both\nhandsome and fat and well dressed, and a great athlete, and make a\nmillion a year, be a wit, a _bon-vivant_, and a lady-killer, as well\nas a philosopher; a philanthropist, statesman, warrior, and African\nexplorer, as well as a 'tone-poet' and saint. But the thing is simply\nimpossible. The millionaire's work would run counter to the saint's;\nthe _bon-vivant_ and the philanthropist would trip each other up; the\nphilosopher and the lady-killer could not well keep house in the same\ntenement of clay. Such different characters may conceivably at the\noutset of life be alike _possible_ to a man. But to make any one of\nthem actual, the rest must more or less be suppressed. So the seeker\nof his truest, strongest, deepest self must review the list carefully,\nand pick out the one on which to stake his salvation. All other selves\nthereupon become unreal, but the fortunes of this self are real. Its\nfailures are real failures, its triumphs real triumphs, carrying shame\nand gladness with them. This is as strong an example as there is of\nthat selective industry of the mind on which I insisted some pages back\n(p. 284 ff.). Our thought, incessantly deciding, among many things of\na kind, which ones for it shall be realities, here chooses one of many\npossible selves or characters, and forthwith reckons it no shame to\nfail in any of those not adopted expressly as its own.\nI, who for the time have staked my all on being a psychologist,\nam mortified if others know much more psychology than I. But I am\ncontented to wallow in the grossest ignorance of Greek. My deficiencies\nthere give me no sense of personal humiliation at all. Had I\n'pretensions' to be a linguist, it would have been just the reverse.\nSo we have the paradox of a man shamed to death because he is only the\nsecond pugilist or the second oarsman in the world. That he is able to\nbeat the whole population of the globe minus one is nothing; he has\n'pitted' himself to beat that one; and as long as he doesn't do that\nnothing else counts. He is to his own regard as if he were not, indeed\nhe _is_ not.\nYonder puny fellow, however, whom every one can beat, suffers no\nchagrin about it, for he has long ago abandoned the attempt to 'carry\nthat line,' as the merchants say, of self at all. With no attempt\nthere can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our\nself-feeling in this world depends entirely on what we _back_ ourselves\nto be and do. It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our\nsupposed potentialities; a fraction of which our pretensions are the\ndenominator and the numerator our success: thus, Self-esteem = Success/\nPretensions. Such a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing\nthe denominator as by increasing the numerator.[264] To give up\npretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them gratified; and where\ndisappointment is incessant, and the struggle unending, this is what\nmen will always do. The history of evangelical theology, with its\nconviction of sin, its self-despair, and its abandonment of salvation\nby works, is the deepest of possible examples, but we meet others in\nevery walk of life. There is the strangest lightness about the heart\nwhen one's nothingness in a particular line is once accepted in good\nfaith. _All_ is not bitterness in the lot of the lover sent away by\nthe final inexorable 'No.' Many Bostonians, _crede experto_ (and\ninhabitants of other cities, too, I fear), would be happier women and\nmen to-day, if they could once for all abandon the notion of keeping up\na Musical Self, and without shame let people hear them call a symphony\na nuisance. How pleasant is the day when we give up striving to be\nyoung,--or slender! Thank God! we say, _those_ illusions are gone.\nEverything added to the Self is a burden as well as a pride. A certain\nman who lost every penny during our civil war went and actually rolled\nin the dust, saying he had not felt so free and happy since he was born.\nOnce more, then, our self-feeling is in our power. As Carlyle says:\n\"Make thy claim of wages a zero, then hast thou the world under\nthy feet. Well did the wisest of our time write, it is only with\n_renunciation_ that life, properly speaking, can be said to begin.\"\nNeither threats nor pleadings can move a man unless they touch some\none of his potential or actual selves. Only thus can we, as a rule,\nget a 'purchase' on another's will. The first care of diplomatists and\nmonarchs and all who wish to rule or influence is, accordingly, to\nfind out their victim's strongest principle of self-regard, so as to\nmake that the fulcrum of all appeals. But if a man has given up those\nthings which are subject to foreign fate, and ceased to regard them as\nparts of himself at all, we are well-nigh powerless over him. The Stoic\nreceipt for contentment was to dispossess yourself in advance of all\nthat was out of your own power,--then fortune's shocks might rain down\nunfelt. Epictetus exhorts us, by thus narrowing and at the same time\nsolidifying our Self to make it invulnerable: \"I must die; well, but\nmust I die groaning too? I will speak what appears to be right, and if\nthe despot says, then I will put you to death, I will reply, 'When did\nI ever tell you that I was immortal? You will do your part and I mine;\nit is yours to kill and mine to die intrepid; yours to banish, mine to\ndepart untroubled.' How do we act in a voyage? We choose the pilot, the\nsailors, the hour. Afterwards comes a storm. What have I to care for?\nMy part is performed. This matter belongs to the pilot. But the ship is\nsinking; what then have I to do? That which alone I can do--submit to\nbeing drowned without fear, without clamor or accusing of God, but as\none who knows that what is born must likewise die.\"[265]\nThis Stoic fashion, though efficacious and heroic enough in its\nplace and time, is, it must be confessed, only possible as an\nhabitual mood of the soul to narrow and unsympathetic characters. It\nproceeds altogether by exclusion. If I am a Stoic, the goods I cannot\nappropriate cease to be _my_ goods, and the temptation lies very near\nto deny that they are goods at all. We find this mode of protecting\nthe Self by exclusion and denial very common among people who are in\nother respects not Stoics. All narrow people _intrench_ their Me, they\n_retract_ it,--from the region of what they cannot securely possess.\nPeople who don't resemble them, or who treat them with indifference,\npeople over whom they gain no influence, are people on whose existence,\nhowever meritorious it may intrinsically be, they look with chill\nnegation, if not with positive hate. Who will not be mine I will\nexclude from existence altogether; that is, as far as I can make it\nso, such people shall be as if they were not.[266] Thus may a certain\nabsoluteness and definiteness in the outline of my Me console me for\nthe smallness of its content.\nSympathetic people, on the contrary, proceed by the entirely opposite\nway of expansion and inclusion. The outline of their self often gets\nuncertain enough, but for this the spread of its content more than\natones. _Nil humani a me alienum._ Let them despise this little person\nof mine, and treat me like a dog, _I_ shall not negate _them_ so long\nas I have a soul in my body. They are realities as much as I am. What\npositive good is in them shall be mine too, etc., etc. The magnanimity\nof these expansive natures is often touching indeed. Such persons\ncan feel a sort of delicate rapture in thinking that, however sick,\nill-favored, mean-conditioned, and generally forsaken they may be,\nthey yet are integral parts of the whole of this brave world, have a\nfellow's share in the strength of the dray-horses, the happiness of\nthe young people, the wisdom of the wise ones, and are not altogether\nwithout part or lot in the good fortunes of the Vanderbilts and the\nHohenzollerns themselves. Thus either by negating or by embracing,\nthe Ego may seek to establish itself in reality. He who, with Marcus\nAurelius, can truly say, \"O Universe, I wish all that thou wishest,\"\nhas a self from which every trace of negativeness and obstructiveness\nhas been removed--no wind can blow except to fill its sails.\n*       *       *       *       *\nA tolerably unanimous opinion ranges the different selves of which a\nman may be 'seized and possessed,' and the consequent different orders\nof his self-regard, in an _hierarchical scale, with the bodily Self at\nthe bottom, the spiritual Self at top, and the extracorporeal material\nselves and the various social selves between_. Our merely natural\nself-seeking would lead us to aggrandize all these selves; we give\nup deliberately only those among them which we find we cannot keep.\nOur unselfishness is thus apt to be a 'virtue of necessity'; and it\nis not without all show of reason that cynics quote the fable of the\nfox and the grapes in describing our progress therein. But this is the\nmoral education of the race; and if we agree in the result that on the\nwhole the selves we can keep are the intrinsically best, we need not\ncomplain of being led to the knowledge of their superior worth in such\na tortuous way.\nOf course this is not the only way in which we learn to subordinate our\nlower selves to our higher. A direct ethical judgment unquestionably\nalso plays its part, and last, not least, we apply to our own persons\njudgments originally called forth by the acts of others. It is one\nof the strangest laws of our nature that many things which we are\nwell satisfied with in ourselves disgust us when seen in others.\nWith another man's bodily 'hoggishness' hardly anyone has any\nsympathy;--almost as little with his cupidity, his social vanity and\neagerness, his jealousy, his despotism, and his pride. Left absolutely\nto myself I should probably allow all these spontaneous tendencies\nto luxuriate in me unchecked, and it would be long before I formed\na distinct notion of the order of their subordination. But having\nconstantly to pass judgment on my associates, I come ere long to see,\nas Herr Horwicz says, my own lusts in the mirror of the lusts of\nothers, and to _think_ about them in a very different way from that in\nwhich I simply _feel_. Of course, the moral generalities which from\nchildhood have been instilled into me accelerate enormously the advent\nof this reflective judgment on myself.\nSo it comes to pass that, as aforesaid, men have arranged the various\nselves which they may seek in an hierarchical scale according to their\nworth. A certain amount of bodily selfishness is required as a basis\nfor all the other selves. But too much sensuality is despised, or at\nbest condoned on account of the other qualities of the individual. The\nwider material selves are regarded as higher than the immediate body.\nHe is esteemed a poor creature who is unable to forego a little meat\nand drink and warmth and sleep for the sake of getting on in the world.\nThe social self as a whole, again, ranks higher than the material self\nas a whole. We must care more for our honor, our friends, our human\nties, than for a sound skin or wealth. And the spiritual self is so\nsupremely precious that, rather than lose it, a man ought to be willing\nto give up friends and good fame, and property, and life itself.\n_In each kind of self, material, social, and spiritual, men distinguish\nbetween the immediate and actual, and the remote and potential,_\nbetween the narrower and the wider view, to the detriment of the former\nand advantage of the latter. One must forego a present bodily enjoyment\nfor the sake of one's general health; one must abandon the dollar in\nthe hand for the sake of the hundred dollars to come; one must make an\nenemy of his present interlocutor if thereby one makes friends of a\nmore valued circle; one must go without learning and grace, and wit,\nthe better to compass one's soul's salvation.\nOf all these wider, more potential selves, _the potential social self_\nis the most interesting, by reason of certain apparent paradoxes to\nwhich it leads in conduct, and by reason of its connection with our\nmoral and religious life. When for motives of honor and conscience\nI brave the condemnation of my own family, club, and 'set'; when,\nas a protestant, I turn catholic; as a catholic, freethinker; as a\n'regular practitioner,' hom\u0153opath, or what not, I am always inwardly\nstrengthened in my course and steeled against the loss of my actual\nsocial self by the thought of other and better _possible_ social\njudges than those whose verdict goes against me now. The ideal social\nself which I thus seek in appealing to their decision may be very\nremote: it may be represented as barely possible. I may not hope for\nits realization during my lifetime; I may even expect the future\ngenerations, which would approve me if they knew me, to know nothing\nabout me when I am dead and gone. Yet still the emotion that beckons\nme on is indubitably the pursuit of an ideal social self, of a self\nthat is at least _worthy_ of approving recognition by the highest\n_possible_ judging companion, if such companion there be.[267] This\nself is the true, the intimate, the ultimate, the permanent Me which\nI seek. This judge is God, the Absolute Mind, the 'Great Companion.'\nWe hear, in these days of scientific enlightenment, a great deal of\ndiscussion about the efficacy of prayer; and many reasons are given us\nwhy we should not pray, whilst others are given us why we should. But\nin all this very little is said of the reason why we _do_ pray, which\nis simply that we cannot _help_ praying. It seems probable that, in\nspite of all that 'science' may do to the contrary, men will continue\nto pray to the end of time, unless their mental nature changes in a\nmanner which nothing we know should lead us to expect. The impulse to\npray is a necessary consequence of the fact that whilst the innermost\nof the empirical selves of a man is a Self of the _social_ sort, it yet\ncan find its only adequate _Socius_ in an ideal world.\nAll progress in the social Self is the substitution of higher tribunals\nfor lower; this ideal tribunal is the highest; and most men, either\ncontinually or occasionally, carry a reference to it in their breast.\nThe humblest outcast on this earth can feel himself to be real and\nvalid by means of this higher recognition. And, on the other hand, for\nmost of us, a world with no such inner refuge when the outer social\nself failed and dropped from us would be the abyss of horror. I say\n'for most of us,' because it is probable that individuals differ a\ngood deal in the degree in which they are haunted by this sense of an\nideal spectator. It is a much more essential part of the consciousness\nof some men than of others. Those who have the most of it are possibly\nthe most _religious_ men. But I am sure that even those who say they\nare altogether without it deceive themselves, and really have it in\nsome degree. Only a non-gregarious animal could be completely without\nit. Probably no one can make sacrifices for 'right,' without to some\ndegree personifying the principle of right for which the sacrifice is\nmade, and expecting thanks from it. _Complete_ social unselfishness,\nin other words, can hardly exist; _complete_ social suicide hardly\noccur to a man's mind. Even such texts as Job's, \"Though He slay me\nyet will I trust Him,\" or Marcus Aurelius's, \"If gods hate me and my\nchildren, there is a reason for it,\" can least of all be cited to\nprove the contrary. For beyond all doubt Job revelled in the thought\nof Jehovah's recognition of the worship after the slaying should have\nbeen done; and the Roman emperor felt sure the Absolute Reason would\nnot be all indifferent to his acquiescence in the gods' dislike. The\nold test of piety, \"Are you willing to be damned for the glory of\nGod?\" was probably never answered in the affirmative except by those\nwho felt sure in their heart of hearts that God would 'credit' them\nwith their willingness, and set more store by them thus than if in His\nunfathomable scheme He had not damned them at all.\nAll this about the impossibility of suicide is said on the supposition\nof _positive_ motives. When possessed by the emotion of _fear_,\nhowever, we are in a _negative_ state of mind; that is, our desire is\nlimited to the mere banishing of something, without regard to what\nshall take its place. In this state of mind there can unquestionably be\ngenuine thoughts, and genuine acts, of suicide, spiritual and social,\nas well as bodily. Anything, _anything_, at such times, so as to escape\nand not to be! But such conditions of suicidal frenzy are pathological\nin their nature and run dead against everything that is regular in the\nlife of the Self in man.\nWHAT SELF IS LOVED IN 'SELF-LOVE'?\nWe must now try to interpret the facts of self-love and self-seeking a\nlittle more delicately from within.\nA man in whom self-seeking of any sort is largely developed is said to\nbe selfish.[268] He is on the other hand called unselfish if he shows\nconsideration for the interests of other selves than his own. Now what\nis the intimate _nature_ of the selfish emotion in him? and what is\nthe primary _object_ of its regard? We have described him pursuing and\nfostering as his self first one set of things and then another; we have\nseen the same set of facts gain or lose interest in his eyes, leave him\nindifferent, or fill him either with triumph or despair according as\nhe made pretensions to appropriate them, treated them as if they were\npotentially or actually parts of himself, or not. We know how little\nit matters to us whether _some_ man, a man taken at large and in the\nabstract, prove a failure or succeed in life,--he may be hanged for\naught we care,--but we know the utter momentousness and terribleness\nof the alternative when the man is the one whose name we ourselves\nbear. _I_ must not be a failure, is the very loudest of the voices\nthat clamor in each of our breasts: let fail who may, _I_ at least\nmust succeed. Now the first conclusion which these facts suggest is\nthat each of us is animated by a _direct feeling of regard for his own\npure principle of individual existence_, whatever that may be, taken\nmerely as such. It appears as if all our concrete manifestations of\nselfishness might be the conclusions of as many syllogisms, each with\nthis principle as the subject of its major premiss, thus: Whatever is\nme is precious; this is me; therefore this is precious; whatever is\nmine must not fail; this is mine; therefore this must not fail, etc.\nIt appears, I say, as if this principle inoculated all it touched with\nits own intimate quality of worth; as if, previous to the touching,\neverything might be matter of indifference, and nothing interesting in\nits own right; as if my regard for my own body even were an interest\nnot simply in this body, but in this body only so far as it is mine.\nBut what is this abstract numerical principle of identity, this\n'Number One' within me, for which, according to proverbial philosophy,\nI am supposed to keep so constant a 'lookout'? Is it the inner nucleus\nof my spiritual self, that collection of obscurely felt 'adjustments,'\n_plus_ perhaps that still more obscurely perceived subjectivity as\nsuch, of which we recently spoke? Or is it perhaps the concrete stream\nof my thought in its entirety, or some one section of the same? Or\nmay it be the indivisible Soul-Substance, in which, according to the\northodox tradition, my faculties inhere? Or, finally, can it be the\nmere pronoun I? Surely it is none of these things, that self for which\nI feel such hot regard. Though all of them together were put within\nme, I should still be cold, and fail to exhibit anything worthy of the\nname of selfishness or of devotion to 'Number One.' To have a self\nthat I can _care for_, nature must first present me with some _object_\ninteresting enough to make me instinctively wish to appropriate it for\nits _own_ sake, and out of it to manufacture one of those material,\nsocial, or spiritual selves, which we have already passed in review.\nWe shall find that all the facts of rivalry and substitution that have\nso struck us, all the shiftings and expansions and contractions of\nthe sphere of what shall be considered me and mine, are but results\nof the fact that certain _things_ appeal to primitive and instinctive\nimpulses of our nature, and that we follow their destinies with an\nexcitement that owes nothing to a reflective source. These objects our\nconsciousness treats as the primordial constituents of its Me. Whatever\nother objects, whether by association with the fate of these, or in any\nother way, come to be followed with the same sort of interest, form our\nremoter and more secondary self. _The words_ ME, _then, and_ SELF, _so\nfar as they arouse feeling and connote emotional worth, are_ OBJECTIVE\n_designations, meaning_ ALL THE THINGS _which have the power to produce\nin a stream of consciousness excitement of a certain peculiar sort._\nLet us try to justify this proposition in detail.\nThe most palpable selfishness of a man is his bodily selfishness;\nand his most palpable self is the body to which that selfishness\nrelates. Now I say that he identifies himself with this body because\nhe loves _it_, and that he does not love it because he finds it to be\nidentified with himself. Reverting to natural history-psychology will\nhelp us to see the truth of this. In the chapter on Instincts we shall\nlearn that every creature has a certain selective interest in certain\nportions of the world, and that this interest is as often connate as\nacquired. Our _interest in things_ means the attention and emotion\nwhich the thought of them will excite, and the actions which their\npresence will evoke. Thus every species is particularly interested in\nits own prey or food, its own enemies, its own sexual mates, and its\nown young. These things fascinate by their intrinsic power to do so;\nthey are cared for for their own sakes.\nWell, it stands not in the least otherwise with our bodies. They\ntoo are percepts in our objective field--they are simply the most\ninteresting percepts there. What happens to them excites in us emotions\nand tendencies to action more energetic and habitual than any which\nare excited by other portions of the 'field.' What my comrades call\nmy bodily selfishness or self-love, is nothing but the sum of all the\nouter acts which this interest in my body spontaneously draws from me.\nMy 'selfishness' is here but a descriptive name for grouping together\nthe outward symptoms which I show. When I am led by self-love to keep\nmy seat whilst ladies stand, or to grab something first and cut out\nmy neighbor, what I really love is the comfortable seat, is the thing\nitself which I grab. I love them primarily, as the mother loves her\nbabe, or a generous man an heroic deed. Wherever, as here, self-seeking\nis the outcome of simple instinctive propensity, it is but a name\nfor certain reflex acts. Something rivets my attention fatally, and\nfatally provokes the 'selfish' response. Could an automaton be so\nskilfully constructed as to ape these acts, it would be called selfish\nas properly as I. It is true that I am no automaton, but a thinker. But\nmy thoughts, like my acts, are here concerned only with the outward\nthings. They need neither know nor care for any pure principle within.\nIn fact the more utterly 'selfish' I am in this primitive way, the more\nblindly absorbed my thought will be in the objects and impulses of my\nlusts, and the more devoid of any inward looking glance. A baby, whose\nconsciousness of the pure Ego, of himself as a thinker, is not usually\nsupposed developed, is, in this way, as some German has said, '_der\nvollendeteste Egoist_.' His corporeal person, and what ministers to its\nneeds, are the only self he can possibly be said to love. His so-called\nself-love is but a name for his insensibility to all but this one set\nof things. It may be that he needs a pure principle of subjectivity,\na soul or pure Ego (he certainly needs a stream of thought) to make\nhim sensible at all to anything, to make him discriminate and love\n_\u00fcberhaupt_,--how that may be, we shall see ere long; but this pure\nEgo, which would then be the _condition_ of his loving, need no more\nbe the _object_ of his love than it need be the object of his thought.\nIf his interests lay altogether in other bodies than his own, if all\nhis instincts were altruistic and all his acts suicidal, still he\nwould need a principle of _consciousness_ just as he does now. Such a\nprinciple cannot then be the principle of his bodily _selfishness_ any\nmore than it is the principle of any other tendency he may show.\nSo much for the bodily self-love. But my _social_ self-love, my\ninterest in the images other men have framed of me, is also an interest\nin a set of objects external to my thought. These thoughts in other\nmen's minds are out of my mind and 'ejective' to me. They come and go,\nand grow and dwindle, and I am puffed up with pride, or blush with\nshame, at the result, just as at my success or failure in the pursuit\nof a material thing. So that here again, just as in the former case,\nthe pure principle seems out of the game as an _object_ of regard, and\npresent only as the general form or condition under which the regard\nand the thinking go on in me at all.\nBut, it will immediately be objected, this is giving a mutilated\naccount of the facts. Those images of me in the minds of other men\nare, it is true, things outside of me, whose changes I perceive just\nas I perceive any other outward change. But the pride and shame which\nI feel are not concerned merely with _those_ changes. I feel as if\nsomething else had changed too, when I perceive my image in your mind\nto have changed for the worse, something in me to which that image\nbelongs, and which a moment ago I felt inside of me, big and strong\nand lusty, but now weak, contracted, and collapsed. Is not this latter\nchange the change I feel the shame about? Is not the condition of this\nthing inside of me the proper object of my egoistic concern, of my\nself-regard? And is it not, after all, my pure Ego, my bare numerical\nprinciple of distinction from other men, and no empirical part of me at\nall?\nNo, it is no such pure principle, it is simply my total empirical\nselfhood again, my historic Me, a collection of objective facts, to\nwhich the depreciated image in your mind 'belongs.' In what capacity\nis it that I claim and demand a respectful greeting from you instead\nof this expression of disdain? It is not as being a bare I that\nI claim it; it is as being an I who has always been treated with\nrespect, who belongs to a certain family and 'set,' who has certain\npowers, possessions, and public functions, sensibilities, duties,\nand purposes, and merits and deserts. All this is what your disdain\nnegates and contradicts; this is 'the thing inside of me' whose changed\ntreatment I feel the shame about; this is what was lusty, and now, in\nconsequence of your conduct, is collapsed; and this certainly is an\nempirical objective thing. Indeed, the thing that is felt modified\nand changed for the worse during my feeling of shame is often more\nconcrete even than this,--it is simply my bodily person, in which\nyour conduct immediately and without any reflection at all on my\npart works those muscular, glandular, and vascular changes which\ntogether make up the 'expression' of shame. In this instinctive,\nreflex sort of shame, the body is just as much the entire vehicle of\nthe self-feeling as, in the coarser cases which we first took up, it\nwas the vehicle of the self-seeking. As, in simple 'hoggishness,' a\nsucculent morsel gives rise, by the reflex mechanism, to behavior which\nthe bystanders find 'greedy,' and consider to flow from a certain sort\nof 'self-regard;' so here your disdain gives rise, by a mechanism\nquite as reflex and immediate, to another sort of behavior, which the\nbystanders call 'shame-faced' and which they consider due to another\nkind of self-regard. But in both cases there may be no particular self\n_regarded_ at all by the mind: and the name self-regard may be only a\ndescriptive title imposed from without the reflex acts themselves, and\nthe feelings that immediately result from their discharge.\nAfter the bodily and social selves come the spiritual. But which\nof my spiritual selves do I really care for? My Soul-substance? my\n'transcendental Ego, or Thinker'? my pronoun I? my subjectivity as\nsuch? my nucleus of cephalic adjustments? or my more phenomenal and\nperishable powers, my loves and hates, willingnesses and sensibilities,\nand the like? Surely the latter. But they, relatively to the central\nprinciple, whatever it may be, are external and objective. They come\nand go, and it remains--\"so shakes the magnet, and so stands the pole.\"\nIt may indeed have to be there for them to be loved, but being there is\nnot identical with being loved itself.\nTo sum up, then, _we see no reason to suppose that 'self-love' is\nprimarily, or secondarily, or ever, love for one's mere principle of\nconscious identity._ It is always love for something which, as compared\nwith that principle, is superficial, transient, liable to be taken up\nor dropped at will.\nAnd zoological psychology again comes to the aid of our understanding\nand shows us that this must needs be so. In fact, in answering the\nquestion what things it is that a man loves in his self-love, we have\nimplicitly answered the farther question, of why he loves them.\nUnless his consciousness were something more than cognitive, unless\nit experienced a partiality for certain of the objects, which, in\nsuccession, occupy its ken, it could not long maintain itself in\nexistence; for, by an inscrutable necessity, each human mind's\nappearance on this earth is conditioned upon the integrity of the body\nwith which it belongs, upon the treatment which that body gets from\nothers, and upon the spiritual dispositions which use it as their\ntool, and lead it either towards longevity or to destruction. _Its own\nbody, then, first of all, its friends next, and finally its spiritual\ndispositions,_ MUST _be the supremely interesting_ OBJECTS _for each\nhuman mind._ Each mind, to begin with, must have a certain minimum\nof selfishness in the shape of instincts of bodily self-seeking in\norder to exist. This minimum must be there as a basis for all farther\nconscious acts, whether of self-negation or of a selfishness more\nsubtle still. All minds must have come, by the way of the survival of\nthe fittest, if by no directer path, to take an intense interest in the\nbodies to which they are yoked, altogether apart from any interest in\nthe pure Ego which they also possess.\nAnd similarly with the images of their person in the minds of others.\nI should not be extant now had I not become sensitive to looks of\napproval or disapproval on the faces among which my life is cast.\nLooks of contempt cast on other persons need affect me in no such\npeculiar way. Were my mental life dependent exclusively on some other\nperson's welfare, either directly or in an indirect way, then natural\nselection would unquestionably have brought it about that I should\nbe as sensitive to the social vicissitudes of that other person as I\nnow am to my own. Instead of being egoistic I should be spontaneously\naltruistic, then. But in this case, only partially realized in actual\nhuman conditions, though the self I empirically love would have\nchanged, my pure Ego or Thinker would have to remain just what it is\nnow.\nMy spiritual powers, again, must interest me more than those of other\npeople, and for the same reason. I should not be here at all unless I\nhad cultivated them and kept them from decay. And the same law which\nmade me once care for them makes me care for them still.\n_My own body and what ministers to its needs are thus the primitive\nobject, instinctively determined, of my egoistic interests. Other\nobjects may become interesting derivatively_ through association with\nany of these things, either as means or as habitual concomitants; _and\nso in a thousand ways the primitive sphere of the egoistic emotions may\nenlarge_ and change its boundaries.\nThis sort of interest is really the _meaning of the word 'my.'_\nWhatever has it is _eo ipso_ a part of me. My child, my friend dies,\nand where he goes I feel that part of myself now is and evermore shall\nbe:\n\"For this losing is true dying;\nThis is lordly man's down-lying;\nThis his slow but sure reclining,\nStar by star his world resigning.\"\nThe fact remains, however, that certain special sorts of thing tend\nprimordially to possess this interest, and form the _natural_ me. But\nall these things are _objects_, properly so called, to the subject\nwhich does the thinking.[269] And this latter fact upsets at once the\ndictum of the old-fashioned sensationalist psychology, that altruistic\npassions and interests are contradictory to the nature of things,\nand that if they appear anywhere to exist, it must be as secondary\nproducts, resolvable at bottom into cases of selfishness, taught by\nexperience a hypocritical disguise. If the zoological and evolutionary\npoint of view is the true one, there is no reason why any object\nwhatever _might_ not arouse passion and interest as primitively and\ninstinctively as any other, whether connected or not with the interests\nof the me. The phenomenon of passion is in origin and essence the\nsame, whatever be the target upon which it is discharged; and what the\ntarget actually happens to be is solely a question of fact. I might\nconceivably be as much fascinated, and as primitively so, by the care\nof my neighbor's body as by the care of my own. The only check to\nsuch exuberant altruistic interests is natural selection, which would\nweed out such as were very harmful to the individual or to his tribe.\nMany such interests, however, remain unweeded out--the interest in\nthe opposite sex, for example, which seems in mankind stronger than\nis called for by its utilitarian need; and alongside of them remain\ninterests, like that in alcoholic intoxication, or in musical sounds,\nwhich, for aught we can see, are without any utility whatever. The\nsympathetic instincts and the egoistic ones are thus co-ordinate. They\narise, so far as we can tell, on the same psychologic level. The only\ndifference between them is, that the instincts called egoistic form\nmuch the larger mass.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe only author whom I know to have discussed the question whether the\n'pure Ego,' _per se_, can be an object of regard, is Herr Horwicz,\nin his extremely able and acute _Psychologische Analysen_. He too\nsays that all self-regard is regard for certain objective things. He\ndisposes so well of one kind of objection that I must conclude by\nquoting a part of his own words:\nFirst, the objection:\n\"The fact is indubitable that one's own children always pass for\nthe prettiest and brightest, the wine from one's own cellar for the\nbest--at least for its price,--one's own house and horses for the\nfinest. With what tender admiration do we con over our own little\ndeed of benevolence! our own frailties and misdemeanors, how ready\nwe are to acquit ourselves for them, when we notice them at all, on\nthe ground of 'extenuating circumstances'! How much more really comic\nare our own jokes than those of others, which, unlike ours, will not\nbear being repeated ten or twelve times over! How eloquent, striking,\npowerful, our own speeches are! How appropriate our own address! In\nshort, how much more intelligent, soulful, better, is everything about\nus than in anyone else. The sad chapter of artists' and authors'\nconceit and vanity belongs here.\n\"The prevalence of this obvious preference which we feel for\neverything of our own is indeed striking. Does it not look as if our\ndear Ego must first lend its color and flavor to anything in order to\nmake it please us?... Is it not the simplest explanation for all these\nphenomena, so consistent among themselves, to suppose that the Ego,\nthe self, which forms the origin and centre of our _thinking_ life,\nis at the same time the original and central object of our life of\nfeeling, and the ground both of whatever special ideas and of whatever\nspecial feelings ensue?\"\nHerr Horwicz goes on to refer to what we have already noticed, that\nvarious things which disgust us in others do not disgust us at all in\nourselves.\n\"To most of us even the bodily warmth of another, for example the\nchair warm from another's sitting, is felt unpleasantly, whereas there\nis nothing disagreeable in the warmth of the chair in which we have\nbeen sitting ourselves.\"\nAfter some further remarks, he replies to these facts and reasonings as\nfollows;\n\"We may with confidence affirm that our own possessions in most cases\nplease us better [not because they are ours], but simply because we\nknow them better, 'realize' them more intimately, feel them more\ndeeply. We learn to appreciate what is ours in all its details and\nshadings, whilst the goods of others appear to us in coarse outlines\nand rude averages. Here are some examples: A piece of music which\none plays one's self is heard and understood better than when it is\nplayed by another. We get more exactly all the details, penetrate\nmore deeply into the musical thought. We may meanwhile perceive\nperfectly well that the other person is the better performer, and\nyet nevertheless--at times--get more enjoyment from our own playing\nbecause it brings the melody and harmony so much nearer home to\nus. This case may almost be taken as typical for the other cases of\nself-love. On close examination, we shall almost always find that a\ngreat part of our feeling about what is ours is due to the fact that\nwe _live closer_ to our own things, and so feel them more thoroughly\nand deeply. As a friend of mine was about to marry, he often bored me\nby the repeated and minute way in which he would discuss the details\nof his new household arrangements. I wondered that so intellectual a\nman should be so deeply interested in things of so external a nature.\nBut as I entered, a few years later, the same condition myself, these\nmatters acquired for me an entirely different interest, and it became\nmy turn to turn them over and talk of them unceasingly.... The reason\nwas simply this, that in the first instance I _understood_ nothing\nof these things and their importance for domestic comfort, whilst in\nthe latter ease they came home to me with irresistible urgency, and\nvividly took possession of my fancy. So it is with many a one who\nmocks at decorations and titles, until he gains one himself. And this\nis also surely the reason why one's own portrait or reflection in the\nmirror is so peculiarly interesting a thing to contemplate ... not\non account of any absolute '_c'est moi_,' but just as with the music\nplayed by ourselves. What greets our eyes is what we know best, most\ndeeply understand; because we ourselves have felt it and lived through\nit. We know what has ploughed these furrows, deepened these shadows,\nblanched this hair; and other faces may be handsomer, but none can\nspeak to us or interest us like this.\"[270]\nMoreover, this author goes on to show that our own things are _fuller_\nfor us than those of others because of the memories they awaken and\nthe practical hopes and expectations they arouse. This alone would\nemphasize them, apart from any value derived from their belonging\nto ourselves. We may conclude with him, then, that _an original\ncentral self-feeling can never explain the passionate warmth of our\nself-regarding emotions, which must, on the contrary, be addressed\ndirectly to special things less abstract and empty of content. To these\nthings the name of 'self' may be given, or to our conduct towards them\nthe name of 'selfishness,' but neither in the self nor the selfishness\ndoes the pure Thinker play the 'title-role.'_\n*       *       *       *       *\nOnly one more point connected with our self-regard need be mentioned.\nWe have spoken of it so far as active instinct or emotion. It remains\nto speak of it as cold _intellectual self-estimation_. We may weigh our\nown Me in the balance of praise and blame as easily as we weigh other\npeople,--though with difficulty quite as fairly. The _just_ man is the\none who can weigh himself impartially. Impartial weighing presupposes\na rare faculty of abstraction from the vividness with which, as\nHerr Horwicz has pointed out, things known as intimately as our own\npossessions and performances appeal to our imagination; and an equally\nrare power of vividly representing the affairs of others. But, granting\nthese rare powers, there is no reason why a man should not pass\njudgment on himself quite as objectively and well as on anyone else. No\nmatter how he _feels_ about himself, unduly elated or unduly depressed,\nhe may still truly _know_ his own worth by measuring it by the outward\nstandard he applies to other men, and counteract the injustice of\nthe feeling he cannot wholly escape. This self-measuring process has\nnothing to do with the instinctive self-regard we have hitherto been\ndealing with. Being merely one application of intellectual comparison,\nit need no longer detain us here. Please note again, however, how\nthe pure Ego appears merely as the vehicle in which the estimation\nis carried on, the objects estimated being all of them facts of an\nempirical sort,[271] one's body, one's credit, one' fame, one's\nintellectual ability, one's goodness, or whatever the case may be.\nThe empirical life of Self is divided, as below, into\nMATERIAL.

Ever since Hume's time, it has been\njustly regarded as the most puzzling puzzle with which psychology\nhas to deal; and whatever view one may espouse, one has to hold his\nposition against heavy odds. If, with the Spiritualists, one contend\nfor a substantial soul, or transcendental principle of unity, one can\ngive no positive account of what that may be. And if, with the Humians,\none deny such a principle and say that the stream of passing thoughts\nis all, one runs against the entire common-sense of mankind, of which\nthe belief in a distinct principle of selfhood seems an integral part.\nWhatever solution be adopted in the pages to come, we may as well make\nup our minds in advance that it will fail to satisfy the majority of\nthose to whom it is addressed. The best way of approaching the matter\nwill be to take up first--\n_The Sense of Personal Identity._\nIn the last chapter it was stated in as radical a way as possible that\nthe thoughts which we actually know to exist do not fly about loose,\nbut seem each to belong to some one thinker and not to another. Each\nthought, out of a multitude of other thoughts of which it may think, is\nable to distinguish those which belong to its own Ego from those which\ndo not. The former have a warmth and intimacy about them of which the\nlatter are completely devoid, being merely conceived, in a cold and\nforeign fashion, and not appearing as blood-relatives, bringing their\ngreetings to us from out of the past.\nNow this consciousness of personal sameness may be treated either as\na subjective phenomenon or as an objective deliverance, as a feeling,\nor as a truth. We may explain how one bit of thought can come to judge\nother bits to belong to the same Ego with itself; or we may criticise\nits judgment and decide how far it may tally with the nature of things.\nAs a mere subjective phenomenon the judgment presents no difficulty or\nmystery peculiar to itself. It belongs to the great class of judgments\nof sameness; and there is nothing more remarkable in making a judgment\nof sameness in the first person than in the second or the third. The\nintellectual operations seem essentially alike, whether I say 'I am the\nsame,' or whether I say 'the pen is the same, as yesterday.' It is as\neasy to think this as to think the opposite and say 'neither I nor the\npen is the same.'\nThis sort of _bringing of things together into the object of a single\njudgment_ is of course essential to all thinking. The things are\nconjoined _in_ the thought, whatever may be the relation in which they\nappear to the thought. The thinking them is _thinking_ them together,\neven if only with the result of judging that they do not _belong_\ntogether. This sort of _subjective synthesis_, essential to knowledge\nas such (whenever it has a complex object), must not be confounded with\n_objective synthesis_ or union instead of difference or disconnection,\nknown among the things.[272] The subjective synthesis thesis is\ninvolved in thought's mere existence. Even a really disconnected world\ncould only be _known_ to be such by having its parts temporarily united\nin the Object of some pulse of consciousness.[273]\nThe sense of personal identity is not, then, this mere synthetic form\nessential to all thought. It is the sense of a sameness perceived _by_\nthought and predicated of things _thought-about_. These things are a\npresent self and a self of yesterday. The thought not only thinks them\nboth, but thinks that they are identical. The psychologist, looking on\nand playing the critic, might prove the thought wrong, and show there\nwas no real identity,--there might have been no yesterday, or, at any\nrate, no self of yesterday; or, if there were, the sameness predicated\nmight not obtain, or might be predicated on insufficient grounds. In\neither case the personal identity would not exist as a _fact_; but it\nwould exist as a _feeling_ all the same; the consciousness of it by\nthe thought would be there, and the psychologist would still have to\nanalyze that, and show where its illusoriness lay. Let us now be the\npsychologist and see whether it be right or wrong when it says, _I am\nthe same self that I was yesterday_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWe may immediately call it right and intelligible so far as it posits\na past time with past thoughts or selves contained therein--these\nwere data which we assumed at the outset of the book. Right also and\nintelligible so far as it thinks of a present self--that present self\nwe have just studied in its various forms. The only question for us is\nas to what the consciousness may mean when it calls the present self\nthe _same_ with one of the past selves which it has in mind.\nWe spoke a moment since of warmth and intimacy. This leads us to the\nanswer sought. For, whatever the thought we are criticising may think\nabout its present self, that self comes to its acquaintance, or is\nactually felt, with warmth and intimacy. Of course this is the case\nwith the _bodily_ part of it; we feel the whole cubic mass of our body\nall the while, it gives us an unceasing sense of personal existence.\nEqually do we feel the inner 'nucleus of the spiritual self,' either\nin the shape of yon faint physiological adjustments, or (adopting the\nuniversal psychological belief), in that of the pure activity of our\nthought taking place as such. Our remoter spiritual, material, and\nsocial selves, so far as they are realized, come also with a glow\nand a warmth; for the thought of them infallibly brings some degree\nof organic emotion in the shape of quickened heart-beats, oppressed\nbreathing, or some other alteration, even though it be a slight one,\nin the general bodily tone. The character of 'warmth,' then, in the\npresent self, reduces itself to either of two things,--something in the\nfeeling which we have of the thought itself, as thinking, or else the\nfeeling of the body's actual existence at the moment,--or finally to\nboth. We cannot realize our present self without simultaneously feeling\none or other of these two things. Any other fact which brings these two\nthings with it into consciousness will be thought with a warmth and an\nintimacy like those which cling to the present self.\nAny _distant_ self which fulfils this condition will be thought with\nsuch warmth and intimacy. But which distant selves _do_ fulfil the\ncondition, when represented?\nObviously those, and only those, which fulfilled it when they were\nalive. _Them_ we shall imagine with the animal warmth upon them, to\nthem may possibly cling the aroma, the echo of the thinking taken in\nthe act. And by a natural consequence, we shall assimilate them to each\nother and to the warm and intimate self we now feel within us as we\nthink, and separate them as a collection from whatever selves have not\nthis mark, much as out of a herd of cattle let loose for the winter on\nsome wide western prairie the owner picks out and sorts together when\nthe time for the round-up comes in the spring, all the beasts on which\nhe finds his own particular brand.\nThe various members of the collection thus set apart are felt to belong\nwith each other whenever they are thought at all. The animal warmth,\netc., is their herd-mark, the brand from which they can never more\nescape. It runs through them all like a thread through a chaplet and\nmakes them into a whole, which we treat as a unit, no matter how much\nin other ways the parts may differ _inter se_. Add to this character\nthe farther one that the distant selves appear to our thought as having\nfor hours of time been _continuous_ with each other, and the most\nrecent ones of them continuous with the Self of the present moment,\nmelting into it by slow degrees; and we get a still stronger bond of\nunion. As we think we see an identical bodily thing when, in spite of\nchanges of structure, it exists continuously before our eyes, or when,\nhowever interrupted its presence, its quality returns unchanged; so\nhere we think we experience an identical _Self_ when it appears to us\nin an analogous way. Continuity makes us unite what dissimilarity might\notherwise separate; similarity makes us unite what discontinuity might\nhold apart. And thus it is, finally, that Peter, awakening in the same\nbed with Paul, and recalling what both had in mind before they went to\nsleep, reidentifies and appropriates the 'warm' ideas as his, and is\nnever tempted to confuse them with those cold and pale-appearing ones\nwhich he ascribes to Paul. As well might he confound Paul's body, which\nhe only sees, with his own body, which he sees but also feels. Each of\nus when he awakens says, Here's the same old self again, just as he\nsays, Here's the same old bed, the same old room, the came old world.\n_The sense of our own personal identity, then, is exactly like any\none of our other perceptions of sameness among phenomena. It is a\nconclusion grounded either on the resemblance in a fundamental respect;\nor on the continuity before the mind, of the phenomena compared._\nAnd it must not be taken to mean more than these grounds warrant, or\ntreated as a sort of metaphysical or absolute Unity in which all\ndifferences are overwhelmed. The past and present selves compared are\nthe same just so far as they _are_ the same, and no farther. A uniform\nfeeling of 'warmth,' of bodily existence (or an equally uniform feeling\nof pure psychic energy?) pervades them all; and this is what gives them\na _generic_ unity, and makes them the same in _kind_. But this generic\nunity coexists with generic differences just as real as the unity.\nAnd if from the one point of view they are one self, from others they\nare as truly not one but many selves. And similarly of the attribute\nof continuity; it gives its own kind of unity to the self--that of\nmere connectedness, or unbrokenness, a perfectly definite phenomenal\nthing--but it gives not a jot or tittle more. And this unbrokenness\nin the stream of selves, like the unbrokenness in an exhibition of\n'dissolving views,' in no wise implies any farther unity or contradicts\nany amount of plurality in other respects.\nAnd accordingly we find that, where the resemblance and the continuity\nare no longer felt, the sense of personal identity goes too. We hear\nfrom our parents various anecdotes about our infant years, but we do\nnot appropriate them as we do our own memories. Those breaches of\ndecorum awaken no blush, those bright sayings no self-complacency.\nThat child is a foreign creature with which our present self is no\nmore identified in feeling than it is with some stranger's living\nchild to-day. Why? Partly because great time-gaps break up all these\nearly years--we cannot ascend to them by continuous memories; and\npartly because no representation of how the child _felt_ comes up with\nthe stories. We know what he said and did; but no sentiment of his\nlittle body, of his emotions, of his psychic strivings as they felt to\nhim, comes up to contribute an element of warmth and intimacy to the\nnarrative we hear, and the main bond of union with our present self\nthus disappears. It is the same with certain of our dimly-recollected\nexperiences. We hardly know whether to appropriate them or to disown\nthem as fancies, or things read or heard and not lived through. Their\nanimal heat has evaporated; the feelings that accompanied them are so\nlacking in the recall, or so different from those we now enjoy, that\nno judgment of identity can be decisively cast.\n_Resemblance among the parts of a continuum of feelings_ (especially\nbodily feelings) experienced along with things widely different in all\nother regards, _thus constitutes the real and verifiable 'personal\nidentity' which we feel_. There is no other identity than this in the\n'stream' of subjective consciousness which we described in the last\nchapter. Its parts differ, but under all their differences they are\nknit in these two ways; and if either way of knitting disappears,\nthe sense of unity departs. If a man wakes up some fine day unable\nto recall any of his past experiences, so that he has to learn his\nbiography afresh, or if he only recalls the facts of it in a cold\nabstract way as things that he is sure once happened; or if, without\nthis loss of memory, his bodily and spiritual habits all change during\nthe night, each organ giving a different tone, and the act of thought\nbecoming aware of itself in a different way; he _feels_, and he _says_,\nthat he is a changed person. He disowns his former me, gives himself\na new name, identifies his present life with nothing from out of the\nolder time. Such cases are not rare in mental pathology; but, as we\nstill have some reasoning to do, we had better give no concrete account\nof them until the end of the chapter.\nThis description of personal identity will be recognized by the\ninstructed reader as the ordinary doctrine professed by the empirical\nschool. Associationists in England and France, Herbartians in Germany,\nall describe the Self as an aggregate of which each part, as to its\n_being_, is a separate fact. So far so good, then; thus much is true\nwhatever farther things may be true; and it is to the imperishable\nglory of Hume and Herbart and their successors to have taken so much of\nthe meaning of personal identity out of the clouds and made of the Self\nan empirical and verifiable thing.\n*       *       *       *       *\nBut in leaving the matter here, and saying that this sum of passing\nthings is all, these writers have neglected certain more subtle aspects\nof the Unity of Consciousness, to which we next must turn.\nOur recent simile of the herd of cattle will help us. It will be\nremembered that the beasts were brought together into one herd because\ntheir owner found on each of them his brand. The 'owner' symbolizes\nhere that 'section' of consciousness, or pulse of thought, which we\nhave all along represented as the vehicle of the judgment of identity;\nand the 'brand' symbolizes the characters of warmth and continuity, by\nreason of which the judgment is made. There is found a _self_-brand,\njust as there is found a herd-brand. Each brand, so far, is the mark,\nor cause of our knowing, that certain things belong-together. But if\nthe brand is the _ratio cognoscendi_ of the belonging, the belonging,\nin the case of the herd, is in turn the _ratio existendi_ of the brand.\nNo beast would be so branded unless he belonged to the owner of the\nherd. They are not his because they are branded; they are branded\nbecause they are his. So that it seems as if our description of the\nbelonging-together of the various selves, as a belonging-together which\nis merely _represented_, in a later pulse of thought, had knocked the\nbottom out of the matter, and omitted the most characteristic one of\nall the features found in the herd--a feature which common-sense finds\nin the phenomenon of personal identity as well, and for our omission\nof which she will hold us to a strict account. For common-sense\ninsists that the unity of all the selves is not a mere appearance of\nsimilarity or continuity, ascertained after the fact. She is sure that\nit involves a real belonging to a real Owner, to a pure spiritual\nentity of some kind. Relation to this entity is what makes the self's\nconstituents stick together as they do for thought. The individual\nbeasts do not stick together, for all that they wear the same brand.\nEach wanders with whatever accidental mates it finds. The herd's unity\nis only potential, its centre ideal, like the 'centre of gravity'\nin physics, until the herdsman or owner comes. He furnishes a real\ncentre of accretion to which the beasts are driven and by which they\nare held. The beasts stick together by sticking severally to him.\nJust so, common-sense insists, there must be a real proprietor in the\ncase of the selves, or else their actual accretion into a 'personal\nconsciousness' would never have taken place. To the usual empiricist\nexplanation of personal consciousness this is a formidable reproof,\nbecause all the individual thoughts and feelings which have succeeded\neach other 'up to date' are represented by ordinary Associationism\nas in some inscrutable way 'integrating' or gumming themselves\ntogether on their own account, and thus fusing into a stream. All the\nincomprehensibilities which in Chapter VI we saw to attach to the idea\nof things fusing without a _medium_ apply to the empiricist description\nof personal identity.\nBut in our own account the medium is fully assigned, the herdsman is\nthere, in the shape of something not among the things collected, but\nsuperior to them all, namely, the real, present onlooking, remembering,\n'judging thought' or identifying 'section' of the stream. This is what\ncollects,--'owns' some of the past facts which it surveys, and disowns\nthe rest,--and so makes a unity that is actualized and anchored and\ndoes not merely float in the blue air of possibility. And the reality\nof such pulses of thought, with their function of knowing, it will\nbe remembered that we did not seek to deduce or explain, but simply\nassumed them as the ultimate kind of fact that the psychologist must\nadmit to exist.\nBut this assumption, though it yields much, still does not yield all\nthat common-sense demands. The unity into which the Thought--as I\nshall for a time proceed to call, with a capital T, the present mental\nstate--binds the individual past facts with each other and with itself,\ndoes not exist until the Thought is there. It is as if wild cattle\nwere lassoed by a newly-created settler and then owned for the first\ntime. But the essence of the matter to common-sense is that the past\nthoughts never were wild cattle, they were always owned. The Thought\ndoes not capture them, but as soon as it comes into existence it finds\nthem already its own. How is this possible unless the Thought have a\n_substantial_ identity with a former owner,--not a mere continuity or\na resemblance, as in our account, but a _real unity_? Common-sense\nin fact would drive us to admit what we may for the moment call an\nArch-Ego, dominating the entire stream of thought and all the selves\nthat may be represented in it, as the ever self-same and changeless\nprinciple implied in their union. The 'Soul' of Metaphysics and the\n'Transcendental Ego' of the Kantian Philosophy, are, as we shall soon\nsee, but attempts to satisfy this urgent demand of common-sense. But,\nfor a time at least, we can still express without any such hypotheses\nthat appearance of never-lapsing ownership for which common-sense\ncontends.\nFor how would it be if the Thought, the present judging Thought,\ninstead of being in any way substantially or transcendentally identical\nwith the former owner of the past self, merely inherited his 'title,'\nand thus stood as his legal representative now? It would then, if its\nbirth coincided exactly with the death of another owner, _find_ the\npast self already its own as soon as it found it at all, and the past\nself would thus never be wild, but always owned, by a title that never\nlapsed. We can imagine a long succession of herdsmen coming rapidly\ninto possession of the same cattle by transmission of an original title\nby bequest. May not the 'title' of a collective self be passed from one\nThought to another in some analogous way?\nIt is a patent fact of consciousness that a transmission like this\nactually occurs. Each pulse of cognitive consciousness, each Thought,\ndies away and is replaced by another. The other, among the things it\nknows, knows its own predecessor, and finding it 'warm,' in the way we\nhave described, greets it, saying: \"Thou art _mine_, and part of the\nsame self with me.\" Each later Thought, knowing and including thus the\nThoughts which went before, is the final receptacle--and appropriating\nthem is the final owner--of all that they contain and own. Each\nThought is thus born an owner, and dies owned, transmitting whatever\nit realized as its Self to its own later proprietor. As Kant says,\nit is as if elastic balls were to have not only motion but knowledge\nof it, and a first ball were to transmit both its motion and its\nconsciousness to a second, which took both up into _its_ consciousness\nand passed them to a third, until the last ball held all that the other\nballs had held, and realized it as its own. It is this trick which the\nnascent thought has of immediately taking up the expiring thought and\n'adopting' it, which is the foundation of the appropriation of most of\nthe remoter constituents of the self. Who owns the last self owns the\nself before the last, for what possesses the possessor possesses the\npossessed.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt is impossible to discover any _verifiable_ features in personal\nidentity, which this sketch does not contain, impossible to imagine\nhow any transcendent non-phenomenal sort of an Arch-Ego, were he\nthere, could shape matters to any other result, or be known in\ntime by any other fruit, than just this production of a stream of\nconsciousness each 'section' of which should know, and knowing, hug\nto itself and adopt, all those that went before,--thus standing as\nthe _representative_ of the entire past stream; and which should\nsimilarly adopt the objects already adopted by any portion of this\nspiritual stream. Such standing-as-representative, and such adopting,\nare perfectly clear phenomenal relations. The Thought which, whilst it\nknows another Thought and the Object of that Other, appropriates the\nOther and the Object which the Other appropriated, is still a perfectly\ndistinct phenomenon from that Other; it may hardly resemble it; it may\nbe far removed from it in space and time.\nThe only point that is obscure is the _act of appropriation_ itself.\nAlready in enumerating the constituents of the self and their rivalry,\nI had to use the word appropriate. And the quick-witted reader probably\nnoticed at the time, in hearing how one constituent was let drop and\ndisowned and another one held fast to and espoused, that the phrase\nwas meaningless unless the constituents were objects in the hands of\nsomething else. A thing cannot appropriate itself; it _is_ itself;\nand still less can it disown itself. There must be an agent of the\nappropriating and disowning; but that agent we have already named.\nIt is the Thought to whom the various 'constituents' are known. That\nThought is a vehicle of choice as well as of cognition; and among the\nchoices it makes are these appropriations, or repudiations, of its\n'own.' But the Thought never is an object in its own hands, it never\nappropriates or disowns itself. It appropriates _to_ itself, it is\nthe actual focus of accretion, the hook from which the chain of past\nselves dangles, planted firmly in the Present, which alone passes for\nreal, and thus keeping the chain from being a purely ideal thing. Anon\nthe hook itself will drop into the past with all it carries, and then\nbe treated as an object and appropriated by a new Thought in the new\npresent which will serve as living hook in turn. The present moment of\nconsciousness is thus, as Mr. Hodgson says, the darkest in the whole\nseries. It may feel its own immediate existence--we have all along\nadmitted the possibility of this, hard as it is by direct introspection\nto ascertain the fact--but nothing can be known _about_ it till it be\ndead and gone. Its appropriations are therefore less to _itself_ than\nto the most intimately felt _part of its present Object, the body, and\nthe central adjustments,_ which accompany the act of thinking, in the\nhead. _These are the real nucleus of our personal identity,_ and it is\ntheir actual existence, realized as a solid present fact, which makes\nus say 'as sure _as I exist_, those past facts were part of myself.'\nThey are the kernel to which the _represented_ parts of the Self are\nassimilated, accreted, and knit on; and even were Thought entirely\nunconscious of itself in the act of thinking, these 'warm' parts of\nits present object would be a firm basis on which the consciousness\nof personal identity would rest.[274] Such consciousness, then, as\na psychologic fact, can be fully described without supposing any\nother agent than a succession of perishing thoughts, endowed with the\nfunctions of appropriation and rejection, and of which some can know\nand appropriate or reject objects already known, appropriated, or\nrejected by the rest.\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\nTo illustrate by diagram, let A, B, and C stand for three successive\nthoughts, each with its object inside of it. If B's object be A, and\nC's object be B; then A, B, and C would stand for three pulses in a\nconsciousness of personal identity. Each pulse would _be_ something\ndifferent from the others; but B would know and adopt A, and C would\nknow and adopt A and B. Three successive states of the same brain,\non which each experience in passing leaves its mark, might very well\nengender thoughts differing from each other in just such a way as this.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe passing Thought then seems to be the Thinker; and though there\n_may_ be another non-phenomenal Thinker behind that, so far we do not\nseem to need him to express the facts. But we cannot definitively\nmake up our mind about him until we have heard the reasons that have\nhistorically been used to prove his reality.\nTHE PURE SELF OR INNER PRINCIPLE OF PERSONAL UNITY.\nTo a brief survey of the theories of the Ego let us then next proceed.\nThey are three in number, as follows:\n1) The Spiritualist theory;\n2) The Associationist theory;\n3) The Transcendentalist theory.\n_The Theory of the Soul._\nIn Chapter VI we were led ourselves to the spiritualist theory of the\n'Soul,' as a means of escape from the unintelligibilities of mind-stuff\n'integrating' with itself, and from the physiological improbability of\na material monad, with thought attached to it, in the brain. But at the\nend of the chapter we said we should examine the 'Soul' critically in\na later place, to see whether it had any other advantages as a theory\nover the simple phenomenal notion of a stream of thought accompanying a\nstream of cerebral activity, by a law yet unexplained.\nThe theory of the Soul is the theory of popular philosophy and of\nscholasticism, which is only popular philosophy made systematic.\nIt declares that the principle of individuality within us must be\n_substantial_, for psychic phenomena are activities, and there can be\nno activity without a concrete agent. This substantial agent cannot\nbe the brain but must be something _immaterial_; for its activity,\nthought, is both immaterial, and takes cognizance of immaterial things,\nand of material things in general and intelligible, as well as in\nparticular and sensible ways,--all which powers are incompatible with\nthe nature of matter, of which the brain is composed. Thought moreover\nis simple, whilst the activities of the brain are compounded of the\nelementary activities of each of its parts. Furthermore, thought is\nspontaneous or free, whilst all material activity is determined _ab\nextra_; and the will can turn itself against all corporeal goods and\nappetites, which would be impossible were it a corporeal function.\nFor these objective reasons the principle of psychic life must be\nboth immaterial and simple as well as substantial, must be what is\ncalled _a Soul_. The same consequence follows from subjective reasons.\nOur consciousness of personal identity assures us of our essential\nsimplicity: the owner of the various constituents of the self, as\nwe have seen them, the hypothetical Arch-Ego whom we provisionally\nconceived as possible, is a real entity of whose existence\nself-consciousness makes us directly aware. No material agent could\nthus turn round and grasp _itself_--material activities always grasp\nsomething else than the agent. And if a brain _could_ grasp itself and\nbe self-conscious, it would be conscious of itself _as_ a brain and not\nas something of an altogether different kind. The Soul then exists as\na simple spiritual substance in which the various psychic faculties,\noperations, and affections inhere.\nIf we ask what a Substance is, the only answer is that it is a\nself-existent being, or one which needs no other subject in which to\ninhere. At bottom its only positive determination is Being, and this\nis something whose meaning we all realize even though we find it hard\nto explain. The Soul is moreover an _individual_ being, and if we\nask what that is, we are told to look in upon our Self, and we shall\nlearn by direct intuition better than through any abstract reply. Our\ndirect perception of our own inward being is in fact by many deemed\nto be the original prototype out of which our notion of simple active\nsubstance in general is fashioned. The _consequences_ of the simplicity\nand substantiality of the Soul are its incorruptibility and natural\n_immortality_--nothing but God's direct _fiat_ can annihilate it--and\nits _responsibility_ at all times for whatever it may have ever done.\nThis substantialist view of the soul was essentially the view of Plato\nand of Aristotle. It received its completely formal elaboration in the\nmiddle ages. It was believed in by Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, Leibnitz,\nWolf, Berkeley, and is now defended by the entire modern dualistic or\nspiritualistic or common-sense school. Kant held to it while denying\nits fruitfulness as a premise for deducing consequences verifiable\nhere below. Kant's successors, the absolute idealists, profess to have\ndiscarded it,--how that may be we shall inquire ere long. Let us make\nup our minds what to think of it ourselves.\n_It is at all events needless for expressing the actual subjective\nphenomena of consciousness as they appear._ We have formulated them\nall without its aid, by the supposition of a stream of thoughts, each\nsubstantially different from the rest, but cognitive of the rest\nand 'appropriative' of each other's content. At least, if I have\nnot already succeeded in making this plausible to the reader, I am\nhopeless of convincing him by anything I could add now. The unity,\nthe identity, the individuality, and the immateriality that appear in\nthe psychic life are thus accounted for as phenomenal and temporal\nfacts exclusively, and with no need of reference to any more simple or\nsubstantial agent than the present Thought or 'section' of the stream.\nWe have seen it to be single and unique in the sense of having no\n_separable_ parts (above, p. 239 ff.)--perhaps that is the only kind\nof simplicity meant to be predicated of the soul. The present Thought\nalso has being,--at least all believers in the Soul believe so--and if\nthere be no other Being in which it 'inheres,' it ought itself to be a\n'substance.' If _this_ kind of simplicity and substantiality were all\nthat is predicated of the Soul, then it might appear that we had been\ntalking of the soul all along, without knowing it, when we treated\nthe present Thought as an agent, an owner, and the like. But the\nThought is a perishing and not an immortal or incorruptible thing. Its\nsuccessors may continuously succeed to it, resemble it, and appropriate\nit, but they _are_ not it, whereas the Soul-Substance is supposed to\nbe a fixed unchanging thing. By the Soul is always meant something\n_behind_ the present Thought, another kind of substance, existing on a\nnon-phenomenal plane.\nWhen we brought in the Soul at the end of Chapter VI, as an\nentity which the various brain-processes were supposed to affect\nsimultaneously, and which responded to their combined influence by\nsingle pulses of its thought, it was to escape integrated mind-stuff on\nthe one hand, and an improbable cerebral monad on the other. But when\n(as now, after all we have been through since that earlier passage) we\ntake the two formulations, first of a brain to whose processes pulses\nof thought _simply_ correspond, and second, of one to whose processes\npulses of thought _in a Soul_ correspond, and compare them together,\nwe see that at bottom the second formulation is only a more roundabout\nway than the first, of expressing the same bald fact. That bald fact\nis that _when the brain acts, a thought occurs._ The spiritualistic\nformulation says that the brain-processes knock the thought, so to\nspeak, out of a Soul which stands there to receive their influence.\nThe simpler formulation says that the thought simply _comes_. But\nwhat positive meaning has the Soul, when scrutinized, but the _ground\nof possibility_ of the thought? And what is the 'knocking' but the\n_determining of the possibility to actuality_? And what is this after\nall but giving a sort of concreted form to one's belief that the coming\nof the thought, when the brain-processes occur, has _some_ sort of\nground in the nature of things? If the world Soul be understood merely\nto express that claim, it is a good word to use. But if it be held to\ndo more, to gratify the claim,--for instance, to connect rationally\nthe thought which comes, with the processes which occur, and to\nmediate intelligibly between their two disparate natures,--then it is\nan illusory term. It is, in fact, with the word Soul as with the word\nSubstance in general. To say that phenomena inhere in a Substance is\nat bottom only to record one's protest against the notion that the\nbare existence of the phenomena is the total truth. A phenomenon would\nnot itself be, we insist, unless there were something _more_ than the\nphenomenon. To the more we give the provisional name of Substance.\nSo, in the present instance, we ought certainly to admit that there\nis more than the bare fact of coexistence of a passing thought with a\npassing brain-state. But we do not answer the question 'What is that\nmore?' when we say that it is a 'Soul' which the brain-state affects.\nThis kind of more _explains_ nothing; and when we are once trying\nmetaphysical explanations we are foolish not to go as far as we can.\nFor my own part I confess that the moment I become metaphysical and try\nto define the more, I find the notion of some sort of an _anima mundi_\nthinking in all of us to be a more promising hypothesis, in spite of\nall its difficulties, than that of a lot of absolutely individual\nsouls. Meanwhile, as _psychologists_, we need not be metaphysical\nat all. The phenomena are enough, the passing Thought itself is the\nonly _verifiable_ thinker, and its empirical connection with the\nbrain-process is the ultimate known law.\nTo the other arguments which would prove the need of a soul, we may\nalso turn a deaf ear. The argument from free-will can convince only\nthose who believe in free-will; and even they will have to admit that\nspontaneity is just as possible, to say the least, in a temporary\nspiritual agent like our 'Thought' as in a permanent one like the\nsupposed Soul. The same is true of the argument from the kinds of\nthings cognized. Even if the brain could not cognize universal,\nimmaterials, or its 'Self,' still the 'Thought' which we have relied\nupon in our account _is_ not the brain, closely as it seems connected\nwith it; and after all, if the brain could cognize at all, one does\nnot well see why it might not cognize one sort of thing as well as\nanother. The great difficulty is in seeing how a thing can cognize\n_anything_. This difficulty is not in the least removed by giving to\nthe thing that cognizes the name of Soul. The Spiritualists do not\ndeduce any of the properties of the mental life from otherwise known\nproperties of the soul. They simply find various characters ready-made\nin the mental life, and these they clap into the Soul, saying, \"Lo!\nbehold the source from whence they flow!\" The merely verbal character\nof this 'explanation' is obvious. The Soul invoked, far from making\nthe phenomena more intelligible, can only be made intelligible itself\nby borrowing their form,--it must be represented, if at all, as a\ntranscendent stream of consciousness duplicating the one we know.\nAltogether, the Soul is an outbirth of that sort of philosophizing\nwhose great maxim, according to Dr. Hodgson, is: \"Whatever you are\n_totally_ ignorant of, assert to be the explanation of everything else.\"\n*       *       *       *       *\nLocke and Kant, whilst still believing in the soul, began the work of\nundermining the notion that we know anything about it. Most modern\nwriters of the mitigated spiritualistic, or dualistic philosophy--the\nScotch school, as it is often called among us--are forward to proclaim\nthis ignorance, and to attend exclusively to the verifiable phenomena\nof self-consciousness, as we have laid them down. Dr. Wayland, for\nexample, begins his Elements of Intellectual Philosophy with the phrase\n\"Of the essence of Mind we know nothing,\" and goes on: \"All that we\nare able to affirm of it is that it is _something_ which perceives,\nreflects, remembers, imagines, and wills; but what that something\n_is_ which exerts these energies we know not. It is only as we are\nconscious of the action of these energies that we are conscious of the\nexistence of mind. It is only by the exertion of its own powers that\nthe mind becomes cognizant of their existence. The cognizance of its\npowers, however, gives us no knowledge of that essence of which they\nare predicated. In these respects our knowledge of mind is precisely\nanalogous to our knowledge of matter.\" This analogy of our two\nignorances is a favorite remark in the Scotch school. It is but a step\nto lump them together into a single ignorance, that of the 'Unknowable'\nto which any one fond of superfluities in philosophy may accord the\nhospitality of his belief, if it so please him, but which any one else\nmay as freely ignore and reject.\nThe Soul-theory is, then, a complete superfluity, so far as accounting\nfor the actually verified facts of conscious experience goes. So far,\nno one can be compelled to subscribe to it for definite scientific\nreasons. The case would rest here, and the reader be left free to make\nhis choice, were it not for other demands of a more practical kind.\nThe first of these is _Immortality_, for which the simplicity and\nsubstantiality of the Soul seem to offer a solid guarantee. A 'stream'\nof thought, for aught that we see to be contained in its essence,\nmay come to a full stop at any moment; but a simple substance is\nincorruptible, and will, by its own inertia, persist in Being so\nlong as the Creator does not by a direct miracle snuff it out.\nUnquestionably this is the stronghold of the spiritualistic belief,--as\nindeed the popular touchstone for all philosophies is the question,\n\"What is their bearing on a future life?\"\nThe Soul, however, when closely scrutinized, guarantees no immortality\nof a sort _we care for_. The enjoyment of the atom-like simplicity of\ntheir substance _in s\u00e6cula s\u00e6culorum_ would not to most people seem a\nconsummation devoutly to be wished. The substance must give rise to a\nstream of consciousness continuous with the present stream, in order\nto arouse our hope, but of this the mere persistence of the substance\n_per se_ offers no guarantee. Moreover, in the general advance of our\nmoral ideas, there has come to be something ridiculous in the way\nour forefathers had of grounding their hopes of immortality on the\nsimplicity of their substance. The demand for immortality is nowadays\nessentially teleological. We believe ourselves immortal because we\nbelieve ourselves _fit_ for immortality. A 'substance' ought surely\nto perish, we think, if not worthy to survive; and an insubstantial\n'stream' to prolong itself, provided it be worthy, if the nature\nof Things is organized in the rational way in which we trust it\nis. Substance or no substance, soul or 'stream,' what Lotze says of\nimmortality is about all that human wisdom can say:\n\"We have no other principle for deciding it than this general\nidealistic belief: that every created thing will continue whose\ncontinuance belongs to the meaning of the world, and so long as it\ndoes so belong; whilst every one will pass away whose reality is\njustified only in a transitory phase of the world's course. That this\nprinciple admits of no further application in human hands need hardly\nbe said. _We_ surely know not the merits which may give to one being a\nclaim on eternity, nor the defects which would cut others off.\"[275]\nA second alleged necessity for a soul-substance is our forensic\nresponsibility before God. Locke caused an uproar when he said that\nthe unity of _consciousness_ made a man the same _person_, whether\nsupported by the same _substance_ or no, and that God would not, in\nthe great day, make a person answer for what he remembered nothing of.\nIt was supposed scandalous that our forgetfulness might thus deprive\nGod of the chance of certain retributions, which otherwise would have\nenhanced his 'glory.' This is certainly a good speculative ground\nfor retaining the Soul--at least for those who demand a plenitude of\nretribution. The mere stream of consciousness, with its lapses of\nmemory, cannot possibly be as 'responsible' as a soul which _is_ at the\njudgment day all that it ever was. To modern readers, however, who are\nless insatiate for retribution than their grandfathers, this argument\nwill hardly be as convincing as it seems once to have been.\n*       *       *       *       *\nOne great use of the Soul has always been to account for, and at the\nsame time to guarantee, the closed individuality of each personal\nconsciousness. The thoughts of one soul must unite into one self, it\nwas supposed, and must be eternally insulated from those of every\nother soul. But we have already begun to see that, although unity is\nthe rule of each man's consciousness, yet in some individuals, at\nleast, thoughts may split away from the others and form separate\nselves. As for insulation, it would be rash, in view of the phenomena\nof thought-transference, mesmeric influence and spirit-control, which\nare being alleged nowadays on better authority than ever before, to\nbe too sure about that point either. The definitively closed nature\nof our personal consciousness is probably an average statistical\nresultant of many conditions, but not an elementary force or fact;\nso that, if one wishes to preserve the Soul, the less he draws his\narguments from _that_ quarter the better. So long as our self, on the\nwhole, makes itself good and practically maintains itself as a closed\nindividual, why, as Lotze says, is not that enough? And why is the\n_being_-an-individual in some inaccessible metaphysical way so much\nprouder an achievement?[276]\nMy final conclusion, then, about the substantial Soul is that it\nexplains nothing and guarantees nothing. Its successive thoughts are\nthe only intelligible and verifiable things about it, and definitely\nto ascertain the correlations of these with brain-processes is as\nmuch as psychology can empirically do. From the metaphysical point\nof view, it is true that one may claim that the correlations have a\nrational ground; and if the word Soul could be taken to mean merely\nsome such vague problematic ground, it would be unobjectionable. But\nthe trouble is that it professes to give the ground in positive terms\nof a very dubiously credible sort. I therefore feel entirely free to\ndiscard the word Soul from the rest of this book. If I ever use it,\nit will be in the vaguest and most popular way. The reader who finds\nany comfort in the idea of the Soul, is, however, perfectly free to\ncontinue to believe in it; for our reasonings have not established the\nnon-existence of the Soul; they have only proved its superfluity for\nscientific purposes.\nThe next theory of the pure Self to which we pass is\n_The Associationist Theory._\nLocke paved the way for it by the hypothesis he suggested of the same\nsubstance having two successive consciousnesses, or of the same\nconsciousness being supported by more than one substance. He made his\nreaders feel that the _important_ unity of the Self was its verifiable\nand felt unity, and that a metaphysical or absolute unity would be\ninsignificant, so long as a _consciousness_ of diversity might be there.\nHume showed how great the consciousness of diversity actually was.\nIn the famous chapter on Personal Identity, in his Treatise on Human\nNature, he writes as follows:\n\"There are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment\nintimately conscious of what we call our SELF; that we feel its\nexistence and its continuance in existence, and are certain, beyond\nthe evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect identity and\nsimplicity.... Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary\nto that very experience which is pleaded for them, nor have we any\nidea of Self, after the manner it is here explained.... It must be\nsome one impression that gives rise to every real idea.... If any\nimpression gives rise to the idea of Self, that impression must\ncontinue invariably the same through the whole course of our lives,\nsince self is supposed to exist after that manner. But there is no\nimpression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and joy,\npassions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the\nsame time.... For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I\ncall _myself_, I always stumble on some particular perception or other\nof heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure.\nI never can catch _myself_ at any time without a perception, and\nnever can observe anything but the perception. When my perceptions\nare removed for any time, as by sound sleep, so long am I insensible\nof _myself_ and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my\nperceptions removed by death, and could I neither think, nor feel, nor\nsee, nor love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I should be\nentirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to\nmake me a perfect non-entity. If anyone, upon serious and unprejudiced\nreflection, thinks he has a different notion of _himself_ I must\nconfess I can reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that\nhe may be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially\ndifferent in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something\nsimple and continued which he calls _himself_; though I am certain\nthere is no such principle in me.\n\"But setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind, I may venture to\naffirm of the rest of mankind that they are _nothing but a bundle or\ncollection of different perceptions_, which succeed each other with\nan inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement.\nOur eyes cannot turn in their sockets without varying our perceptions.\nOur thought is still more variable than our sight; and all our\nother senses and faculties contribute to this change; nor is there\nany single power of the soul which remains unalterably the same,\nperhaps for one moment The mind is a kind of theatre, where several\nperceptions successively make their appearance; pass, repass, glide\naway and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations.\n_There is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity\nin different_; whatever natural propension we may have to imagine\nthat simplicity and identity. The comparison of the theatre must not\nmislead us. They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute\nthe mind; nor have we the most distant notion of the place where these\nscenes are represented, nor of the material of which it is composed.\"\nBut Hume, after doing this good piece of introspective work, proceeds\nto pour out the child with the bath, and to fly to as great an extreme\nas the substantialist philosophers. As they say the Self is nothing\nbut Unity, unity abstract and absolute, so Hume says it is nothing but\nDiversity, diversity abstract and absolute; whereas in truth it is\nthat mixture of unity and diversity which we ourselves have already\nfound so easy to pick apart. We found among the objects of the stream\ncertain feelings that hardly changed, that stood out warm and vivid in\nthe past just as the present feeling does now; and we found the present\nfeeling to be the centre of accretion to which, _de proche en proche_,\nthese other feelings are, _by the judging Thought_, felt to cling.\nHume says nothing of the judging Thought; and he denies this thread\nof resemblance, this core of sameness running through the ingredients\nof the Self, to exist even as a phenomenal thing. To him there is no\n_tertium quid_ between pure unity and pure separateness. A succession\nof ideas \"connected by a close relation affords to an accurate view as\nperfect a notion of diversity as if there was _no manner of relation\"\nat all._\n\"All our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and the mind\nnever perceives any real connection among distinct existences. Did\nour perceptions either inhere in something simple or individual, or\n_did the mind perceive some real connection_ among them, there would\nbe no difficulty in the case. For my part, I must plead the privilege\nof a sceptic and confess that this difficulty is too hard for my\nunderstanding, I pretend not, however, to pronounce it insuperable.\nOthers, perhaps,... may discover some hypothesis that will reconcile\nthese contradictions.\"[277]\nHume is at bottom as much of a metaphysician as Thomas Aquinas. No\nwonder he can discover no 'hypothesis.' The unity of the parts of the\nstream is just as 'real' a connection as their diversity is a real\nseparation; both connection and separation are ways in which the past\nthoughts appear to the present Thought;--unlike each other in respect\nof date and certain qualities--this is the separation; alike in other\nqualities, and continuous in time--this is the connection. In demanding\na more 'real' connection than this obvious and verifiable likeness and\ncontinuity, Hume seeks 'the world behind the looking glass,' and gives\na striking example of that Absolutism which is the great disease of\nphilosophic Thought.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe chain of distinct existences into which Hume thus chopped up our\n'stream' was adopted by all of his successors as a complete inventory\nof the facts. The associationist Philosophy was founded. Somehow, out\nof 'ideas,' each separate, each ignorant of its mates, but sticking\ntogether and calling each other up according to certain laws, all the\nhigher forms of consciousness were to be explained, and among them\nthe consciousness of our personal identity. The task was a hard one,\nin which what we called the psychologist's fallacy (p. 196 ff.) bore\nthe brunt of the work. Two ideas, one of 'A,' succeeded by another of\n'B,' were transmuted into a third idea of '_B after A_.' An idea from\nlast year returning now was taken to be an idea _of last year_; two\nsimilar ideas stood for an _idea of similarity_, and the like; palpable\nconfusions, in which certain facts _about_ the ideas, possible only to\nan outside knower of them, were put into the place of the ideas' own\nproper and limited deliverance and content. Out of such recurrences and\nresemblances in a series of discrete ideas and feelings a knowledge\nwas somehow supposed to be engendered in each feeling that it _was_\nrecurrent and resembling, and that it helped to form a series to whose\nunity the name _I_ came to be joined. In the same way, substantially,\nHerbart,[278] in Germany, tried to show how a conflict of ideas would\nfuse into a _manner of representing itself_ for which _I_ was the\nconsecrated name.[279]\nThe defect of all these attempts is that the conclusion pretended to\nfollow from certain premises is by no means rationally involved in the\npremises. A feeling of any kind, if it simply _returns_, ought to be\nnothing else than what it was at first. If memory of previous existence\nand all sorts of other cognitive functions are attributed to it when it\nreturns, it is no longer the same, but a widely different feeling, and\nought to be so described. _We_ have so described it with the greatest\nexplicitness. We have said that feelings never do return. We have not\npretended to _explain_ this; we have recorded it as an empirically\nascertained law, analogous to certain laws of brain-physiology; and,\nseeking to define the way in which new feelings do differ from the old,\nwe have found them to be _cognizant_ and _appropriative_ of the old,\nwhereas the old were always cognizant and appropriative of something\nelse. Once more, this account pretended to be nothing more than a\ncomplete description of the facts. It explained them no more than the\nassociationist account explains them. But the latter both assumes to\nexplain them and in the same breath falsifies them, and for each reason\nstands condemned.\nIt is but just to say that the associationist writers as a rule seem to\nhave a lurking bad conscience about the Self; and that although they\nare explicit enough about what it is, namely, a train of feelings or\nthoughts, they are very shy about openly tackling the problem of how\nit comes to be aware of itself. Neither Bain nor Spencer, for example,\ndirectly touch this problem. As a rule, associationist writers keep\ntalking about 'the mind' and about what 'we' do; and so, smuggling in\nsurreptitiously what they ought avowedly to have postulated in the form\nof a present 'judging Thought,' they either trade upon their reader's\nlack of discernment or are undiscerning themselves.\nMr. D. G. Thompson is the only associationist writer I know who\nperfectly escapes this confusion, and _postulates_ openly what he\nneeds. \"All states of consciousness,\" he says, \"imply and postulate\na subject Ego, whose substance is unknown and unknowable, to which\n[why not say _by_ which?] states of consciousness are referred as\nattributes, but which in the process of reference becomes objectified\nand becomes itself an attribute of a subject Ego which lies still\nbeyond, and which ever eludes cognition though ever postulated for\ncognition.\"[280] This is exactly our judging and remembering present\n'Thought,' described in less simple terms.\nAfter Mr. Thompson, M. Taine and the two Mills deserve credit for\nseeking to be as clear as they can. Taine tells us in the first volume\nof his 'Intelligence' what the Ego _is_,--a continuous web of conscious\nevents no more really distinct from each other[281] than rhomboids,\ntriangles, and squares marked with chalk on a plank are really\ndistinct, for the plank itself is one. In the second volume he _says_\nall these parts have a common character embedded in them, that of being\n_internal_ [this is our character of 'warmness,' otherwise named]. This\ncharacter is abstracted and isolated by a mental fiction, and is what\nwe are _conscious of_ as our self--'this stable _within_ is what each\nof us calls _I_ or me.' Obviously M. Taine forgets to tell us what this\n'each of us' is, which suddenly starts up and performs the abstraction\nand 'calls' its product I or me. The character does not abstract\n_itself_. Taine means by 'each of us' merely the present 'judging\nThought' with its memory and tendency to appropriate, but he does not\nname it distinctly enough, and lapses into the fiction that the entire\nseries of thoughts, the entire 'plank,' is the reflecting psychologist.\nJames Mill, after defining Memory as a train of associated ideas\nbeginning with that of my past self and ending with that of my\npresent self, defines my Self as a train of ideas of which Memory\ndeclares the first to be continuously connected with the last. The\nsuccessive associated ideas 'run, as it were, into a single point of\nconsciousness.[282] John Mill, annotating this account, says:\n\"The phenomenon of Self and that of Memory are merely two sides of the\nsame fact, or two different modes of viewing the same fact. We may,\nas psychologists, set out from either of them, and refer the other to\nit.... But it is hardly allowable to do both. At least it must be said\nthat by doing so we explain neither. We only show that the two things\nare essentially the same; that my memory of having ascended Skiddaw\non a given day, and my consciousness of being the same person who\nascended Skiddaw on that day, are two modes of stating the same fact:\na fact which psychology has as yet failed to resolve into anything\nmore elementary. In analyzing the complex phenomena of consciousness,\nwe must come to something ultimate; and we seem to have reached two\nelements which have a good _prima facie_ claim to that title. There\nis, first,... the difference between a fact and the Thought of that\nfact: a distinction which we are able to cognize in the past, and\nwhich then constitutes Memory, and in the future, when it constitutes\nExpectation; but in neither case can we give any account of it except\nthat it exists.... Secondly, in addition to this, and setting out from\nthe belief ... that the idea I now have was derived from a previous\nsensation ... there is the further conviction that this sensation ...\nwas my own; that it happened to my self. In other words, I am aware of\na long and uninterrupted succession of past feelings, going back as\nfar as memory reaches, and terminating with the sensations I have at\nthe present moment, all of which are connected by an inexplicable tie,\nthat distinguishes them not only from any succession or combination\nin mere thought, but also from the parallel successions of feelings\nwhich I believe, on satisfactory evidence, to have happened to each\nof the other beings, shaped like myself, whom I perceive around me.\nThis succession of feelings, which I call my memory of the past, is\nthat by which I distinguish my Self. Myself is the person who had that\nseries of feelings, and I know nothing of myself, by direct knowledge,\nexcept that I had them. But there is a bond of some sort among all\nthe parts of the series, which makes me say that they were feelings\nof a person who was the same person throughout [according to us this\nis their 'warmth' and resemblance to the 'central spiritual self' now\nactually felt] and a different person from those who had any of the\nparallel successions of feelings; and this bond, to me, constitutes\nmy Ego. Here I think the question must rest, until some psychologist\nsucceeds better than anyone else has done, in showing a mode in which\nthe analysis can be carried further.\"[283]\nThe reader must judge of our own success in carrying the analysis\nfarther. The various distinctions we have made are all parts of an\nendeavor so to do. John Mill himself, in a later-written passage, so\nfar from advancing in the line of analysis, seems to fall back upon\nsomething perilously near to the Soul. He says:\n\"The fact of recognizing a sensation,... remembering that it has been\nfelt before, is the simplest and most elementary fact of memory: and\nthe _inexplicable tie_ ... which connects the present consciousness\nwith the past one of which it reminds me, is as near as I think we\ncan get to a positive conception of Self. That there is something\nreal in this tie, real as the sensations themselves, and not a mere\nproduct of the laws of thought without any fact corresponding to it,\nI hold to be indubitable.... This original element,... to which we\ncannot give any name but its own peculiar one, without implying some\nfalse or ungrounded theory, is the Ego, or Self. As such I ascribe a\nreality to the Ego--to my own mind--different from that real existence\nas a Permanent Possibility, which is the only reality I acknowledge\nin Matter.... We are forced to apprehend every part of the series as\nlinked with the other parts by _something in common_ which is not the\nfeelings themselves, any more than the succession of the feelings is\nthe feelings themselves; and as that which is the same in the first as\nin the second, in the second as in the third, in the third as in the\nfourth, and so on, must be the same in the first and in the fiftieth,\nthis common element is a permanent element. But beyond this we can\naffirm nothing of it except the states of consciousness themselves.\nThe feelings or consciousnesses which belong or have belonged to it,\nand its possibilities of having more, are the only facts there are to\nbe asserted of Self--the only positive attributes, except permanence,\nwhich we can ascribe to it.\"[284]\nMr. Mill's habitual method of philosophizing was to affirm boldly\nsome general doctrine derived from his father, and then make so many\nconcessions of detail to its enemies as practically to abandon it\naltogether.[285] In this place the concessions amount, so far as they\nare intelligible, to the admission of something very like the Soul.\nThis 'inexplicable tie' which connects the feelings, this 'something in\ncommon' by which they are linked and which is not the passing feelings\nthemselves, but something 'permanent,' of which we can 'affirm nothing'\nsave its attributes and its permanence, what is it but metaphysical\nSubstance come again to life? Much as one must respect the fairness\nof Mill's temper, quite as much must one regret his failure of acumen\nat this point. At bottom he makes the same blunder as Hume: the\nsensations _per se_, he thinks, have no 'tie.' The tie of resemblance\nand continuity which the remembering Thought finds among them is not a\n'real tie' but 'a mere product of the laws of thought;' and the fact\nthat the present Thought 'appropriates' them is also no real tie. But\nwhereas Hume was contented to say that there might after all _be_ no\n'real tie,' Mill, unwilling to admit this possibility, is driven, like\nany scholastic, to place it in a non-phenomenal world.\nJohn Mill's concessions may be regarded as the _definitive bankruptcy\nof the associationist description_ of the consciousness of self,\nstarting, as it does, with the best intentions, and dimly conscious of\nthe path, but 'perplexed in the extreme' at last with the inadequacy\nof those 'simple feelings,' non-cognitive, non-transcendent of\nthemselves, which were the only baggage it was willing to take along.\nOne must _beg_ memory, knowledge on the part of the feelings of\nsomething outside themselves. That granted, every other true thing\nfollows naturally, and it is hard to go astray. The knowledge the\npresent feeling has of the past ones is a real tie between them,\nso is their resemblance; so is their continuity; so is the one's\n'appropriation' of the other: all are real ties, realized in the\njudging Thought of every moment, the only place where _disconnections_\ncould be realized, did they exist. Hume and Mill both imply that a\ndisconnection can be realized there, whilst a tie cannot. But the\nties and the disconnections are exactly on a par, in this matter of\nself-consciousness. The way in which the present Thought appropriates\nthe past is a real way, so long as no other owner appropriates it\nin a more real way, and so long as the Thought has no grounds for\nrepudiating it stronger than those which lead to its appropriation.\nBut no other owner ever does in point of fact present himself for my\npast; and the grounds which I perceive for appropriating it--viz.,\ncontinuity and resemblance with the present--outweigh those I perceive\nfor disowning it--viz., distance in time. My present Thought stands\nthus in the plenitude of ownership of the train of my past selves, is\nowner not only _de facto_, but _de jure_, the most real owner there can\nbe, and all without the supposition of any 'inexplicable tie,' but in a\nperfectly verifiable and phenomenal way.\nTurn we now to what we may call\nTHE TRANSCENDENTALIST THEORY.\nwhich owes its origin to Kant. Kant's own statements are too lengthy\nand obscure for verbatim quotation here, so I must give their substance\nonly. Kant starts, as I understand him, from a view of the _Object_\nessentially like our own description of it on p. 275 ff., that is,\nit is a system of things, qualities or facts in relation. \"_Object_\nis that in the knowledge (Begriff) of which the Manifold of a given\nPerception is connected.\"[286] But whereas we simply begged the vehicle\nof this connected knowledge in the shape of what we call the present\nThought, or section of the Stream of Consciousness (which we declared\nto be the ultimate fact for psychology), Kant denies this to be an\nultimate fact and insists on analyzing it into a large number of\ndistinct, though equally essential, elements. The 'Manifoldness' of\nthe Object is due to Sensibility, which _per se_ is chaotic, and the\nunity is due to the synthetic handling which this Manifold receives\nfrom the higher faculties of Intuition, Apprehension, Imagination,\nUnderstanding, and Apperception. It is the one essential spontaneity of\nthe Understanding which, under these different names, brings unity into\nthe manifold of sense.\n\"The Understanding _is_, in fact, nothing more than the faculty of\nbinding together _a priori_, and of bringing the Manifold of given\nideas under the unity of Apperception, which consequently is the\nsupreme principle in all human knowledge\" (\u00a7 16).\nThe material connected must be _given_ by lower faculties to the\nUnderstanding, for the latter is not an intuitive faculty, but by\nnature 'empty.' And the bringing of this material 'under the unity of\nApperception' is explained by Kant to mean the thinking it always so\nthat, whatever its other determinations be, it may be known as _thought\nby me_.[287] Though this consciousness, that _I think it_, need not be\nat every moment explicitly realized, it is always _capable_ of being\nrealized. For if an object _incapable_ of being combined with the idea\nof a thinker were there, how could it be known, how related to other\nobjects, how form part of 'experience' at all?\nThe awareness that _I think_ is therefore implied in all experience.\nNo connected consciousness of anything without that of _Self_ as its\npresupposition and 'transcendental' condition! All things, then, so\nfar as they are intelligible at all, are so through combination with\npure consciousness of _Self_, and apart from this, at least potential,\ncombination nothing is knowable _to us_ at all.\nBut this self, whose consciousness Kant thus established deductively\nas a _conditio sine qu\u00e2 non_ of experience, is in the same breath\ndenied by him to have any positive attributes. Although Kant's name for\nit--the 'original transcendental synthetic Unity of Apperception'--is\nso long, our consciousness _about_ it is, according to him, short\nenough. Self-consciousness of this 'transcendental' sort tells us,\n'not how we appear, not how we inwardly are, but only _that_ we are'\n(\u00a7 25). At the basis of our knowledge of our selves there lies only\n\"the simple and utterly empty idea: _I_; of which we cannot even\nsay we have a notion, but only a consciousness which accompanies\nall notions. In this _I_, or _he_ or _it_ (the thing) which thinks,\nnothing more is represented than the bare transcendental Subject of the\nknowledge = _x_, which is only recognized by the thoughts which are its\npredicates, and of which, taken by itself, we cannot form the least\nconception\" (_ibid._ 'Paralogisms'). The pure Ego of all apperception\nis thus for Kant not the soul, but only that 'Subject' which is the\nnecessary correlate of the Object in all knowledge. There _is_ a soul,\nKant thinks, but this mere ego-form of our consciousness tells us\nnothing about it, neither whether it be substantial, nor whether it\nbe immaterial, nor whether it be simple, nor whether it be permanent.\nThese declarations on Kant's part of the utter barrenness of the\nconsciousness of the pure Self, and of the consequent impossibility of\nany deductive or 'rational' psychology, are what, more than anything\nelse, earned for him the title of the 'all-destroyer.' The only self we\nknow anything positive _about_, he thinks, is the empirical _me_, not\nthe pure _I_; the self which is an object among other objects and the\n'constituents' of which we ourselves have seen, and recognized to be\nphenomenal things appearing in the form of space as well as time.\nThis, for our purposes, is a sufficient account of the 'transcendental'\nEgo.\nThose purposes go no farther than to ascertain whether anything in\nKant's conception ought to make us give up our own, of a remembering\nand appropriating Thought incessantly renewed. In many respects Kant's\nmeaning is obscure, but it will not be necessary for us to squeeze the\ntexts in order to make sure what it actually and historically was. If\nwe can define clearly two or three things which it may _possibly_ have\nbeen, that will help us just as much to clear our own ideas.\nOn the whole, a defensible interpretation of Kant's view would take\nsomewhat the following shape. Like ourselves he believes in a Reality\noutside the mind of which he writes, but the critic who vouches for\nthat reality does so on grounds of faith, for it is not a verifiable\nphenomenal thing. Neither is it manifold. The 'Manifold' which the\nintellectual functions combine is a mental manifold altogether, which\nthus _stands between_ the Ego of Apperception and the outer Reality,\nbut still stands inside the mind. In the function of knowing there is a\nmultiplicity to be connected, and Kant brings this multiplicity inside\nthe mind. The Reality becomes a mere empty _locus_, or unknowable, the\nso-called Noumenon; the manifold phenomenon is in the mind. We, on the\ncontrary, put the Multiplicity with the Reality outside, and leave\nthe mind simple. Both of us deal with the same elements--thought and\nobject--the only question is in which of them the multiplicity shall\nbe lodged. Wherever it is lodged it must be 'synthetized' when it\ncomes to be thought. And that particular way of lodging it will be the\nbetter, which, in addition to describing the facts naturally, makes the\n'mystery of synthesis' least hard to understand.\nWell, Kant's way of describing the facts is mythological. The notion\nof our thought being this sort of an elaborate internal machine-shop\nstands condemned by all we said in favor of its simplicity on pages\n276 ff. Our Thought is not composed of parts, however so composed\nits objects may be. There is no originally chaotic manifold in it\nto be reduced to order. There is something almost shocking in the\nnotion of so chaste a function carrying this Kantian hurly-burly in\nher womb. If we are to have a dualism of Thought and Reality at all,\nthe multiplicity should be lodged in the latter and not in the former\nmember of the couple of related terms. The parts and their relations\nsurely belong less to the knower than to what is known.\nBut even were all the mythology true, the process of synthesis would\nin no whit be _explained_ by calling the inside of the mind its seat.\nNo mystery would be made lighter by such means. It is just as much\na puzzle _how_ the 'Ego' can employ the productive Imagination to\nmake the Understanding use the categories to combine the data which\nRecognition, Association, and Apprehension receive from sensible\nIntuition, as how the Thought can combine the objective facts.\nPhrase it as one may, the difficulty is always the same: _the Many\nknown by the One_. Or does one seriously think he understands better\n_how_ the knower 'connects' its objects, when one calls the former a\ntranscendental Ego and the latter a 'Manifold of Intuition' than when\none calls them Thought and Things respectively? Knowing must have a\nvehicle. Call the vehicle Ego, or call it Thought, Psychosis, Soul,\nIntelligence, Consciousness, Mind, Reason, Feeling,--what you like--it\nmust _know_. The best grammatical subject for the verb _know_ would,\nif possible, be one from whose other properties the knowing could\nbe deduced. And if there be no such subject, the best one would be\nthat with the fewest ambiguities and the least pretentious name. By\nKant's confession, the transcendental Ego has no properties, and from\nit nothing can be deduced. Its name is pretentious, and, as we shall\npresently see, has its meaning ambiguously mixed up with that of the\nsubstantial soul. So on every possible account we are excused from\nusing it instead of our own term of the present passing 'Thought,' as\nthe principle by which the Many is simultaneously known.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe _ambiguity_ referred to in the meaning of the transcendental Ego is\nas to whether Kant signified by it an _Agent_, and by the Experience\nit helps to constitute, an operation; or whether the experience is an\nevent _produced_ in an unassigned way, and the Ego a mere indwelling\n_element_ therein contained. If an operation be meant, then Ego and\nManifold must both be existent prior to that collision which results\nin the experience of one by the other. If a mere analysis is meant,\nthere is no such prior existence, and the elements only _are_ in so\nfar as they are in union. Now Kant's tone and language are everywhere\nthe very words of one who is talking of operations and the agents by\nwhich they are performed.[288] And yet there is reason to think that\nat bottom he may have had nothing of the sort in mind.[289] In this\nuncertainty we need again do no more than decide what to think of his\ntranscendental Ego _if it be_ an agent.\nWell, if it be so, Transcendentalism is only Substantialism grown\nshame-faced, and the Ego only a 'cheap and nasty' edition of the soul.\nAll our reasons for preferring the 'Thought' to the 'Soul' apply with\nredoubled force when the Soul is shrunk to this estate. The Soul truly\nexplained nothing; the 'syntheses,' which she performed, were simply\ntaken ready-made and clapped on to her as expressions of her nature\ntaken after the fact; but at least she had some semblance of nobility\nand outlook. She was called active; might select; was responsible, and\npermanent in her way. The Ego is simply _nothing_: as ineffectual and\nwindy an abortion as Philosophy can show. It would indeed be one of\nReason's tragedies if the good Kant, with all his honesty and strenuous\npains, should have deemed this conception an important outbirth of his\nthought.\nBut we have seen that Kant deemed it of next to no importance at all.\nIt was reserved for his Fichtean and Hegelian successors to call it\nthe first Principle of Philosophy, to spell its name in capitals and\npronounce it with adoration, to act, in short, as if they were going\nup in a balloon, whenever the notion of it crossed their mind. Here\nagain, however, I am uncertain of the facts of history, and know that\nI may not read my authors aright. The whole lesson of Kantian and\npost-Kantian speculation is, it seems to me, the lesson of simplicity.\nWith Kant, complication both of thought and statement was an inborn\ninfirmity, enhanced by the musty academicism of his K\u00f6nigsberg\nexistence. With Hegel it was a raging fever. Terribly, therefore, do\nthe sour grapes which these fathers of philosophy have eaten set our\nteeth on edge. We have in England and America, however, a contemporary\ncontinuation of Hegelism from which, fortunately, somewhat simpler\ndeliverances come; and, unable to find any definite psychology in what\nHegel, Rosenkranz, or Erdmann tells us of the Ego, I turn to Caird and\nGreen.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe great difference, practically, between these authors and Kant is\ntheir complete abstraction from the onlooking Psychologist and from\nthe Reality he thinks he knows; or rather it is the absorption of\nboth of these outlying terms into the proper topic of Psychology,\nviz., the mental experience of the mind under observation. The Reality\ncoalesces with the connected Manifold, the Psychologist with the Ego,\nknowing becomes 'connecting,' and there results no longer a finite or\ncriticisable, but an 'absolute' Experience, of which the Object and\nthe Subject are always the same. Our finite 'Thought' is virtually and\npotentially this eternal (or rather this 'timeless'), absolute Ego,\nand only provisionally and speciously the limited thing which it seems\n_prima facie_ to be. The later 'sections' of our 'Stream,' which come\nand appropriate the earlier ones, _are_ those earlier ones, just as\nin substantialism the Soul is throughout all time the same.[290] This\n'solipsistic' character of an Experience conceived as absolute really\nannihilates psychology as a distinct body of science.\nPsychology is a natural science, an account of particular finite\nstreams of thought, coexisting and succeeding in time. It is of course\nconceivable (though far from clearly so) that in the last metaphysical\nresort all these streams of thought may be thought by one universal\nAll-thinker. But in this metaphysical notion there is no profit for\npsychology; for grant that one Thinker does think in all of us, still\nwhat He thinks in me and what in you can never be deduced from the\nbare idea of Him. The idea of Him seems even to exert a positively\nparalyzing effect on the mind. The existence of finite thoughts is\nsuppressed altogether. Thought's characteristics, as Professor Green\nsays, are\n\"not to be sought in the incidents of individual lives which last but\nfor a day.... No knowledge, nor any mental act involved in knowledge,\ncan properly be called a 'phenomenon of consciousness.'... For a\nphenomenon is a sensible event, related in the way of antecedence or\nconsequence to other sensible events, but the consciousness which\nconstitutes a knowledge ... is not an event so related nor made up of\nsuch events.\"\nAgain, if\n\"we examine the constituents of any perceived object,... we shall find\nalike that it is only for consciousness that they can exist, and that\nthe consciousness for which they thus exist cannot be merely a series\nof phenomena or a succession of states.... It then becomes clear\nthat there is a function of consciousness, as exercised in the most\nrudimentary experience [namely, the function of _synthesis_] which\nis incompatible with the definition of consciousness as any sort of\nsuccession of any sort of phenomena.\"[291]\nWere we to follow these remarks, we should have to abandon our notion\nof the 'Thought' (perennially renewed in time, but always cognitive\nthereof), and to espouse instead of it an entity copied from thought\nin all essential respects, but differing from it in being 'out of\ntime.' What psychology can gain by this barter would be hard to divine.\nMoreover this resemblance of the timeless Ego to the Soul is completed\nby other resemblances still. The monism of the post-Kantian idealists\nseems always lapsing into a regular old-fashioned spiritualistic\ndualism. They incessantly talk as if, like the Soul, their All-thinker\nwere an Agent, operating on detached materials of sense. This may come\nfrom the accidental fact that the English writings of the school have\nbeen more polemic than constructive, and that a reader may often take\nfor a positive profession a statement _ad hominem_ meant as part of a\nreduction to the absurd, or mistake the analysis of a bit of knowledge\ninto elements for a dramatic myth about its creation. But I think the\nmatter has profounder roots. Professor Green constantly talks of the\n'activity' of Self as a 'condition' of knowledge taking place. Facts\nare said to become incorporated with other facts only through the\n'_action_ of a combining self-consciousness upon data of sensation.'\n\"Every object we perceive ... requires, in order to its presentation,\nthe _action_ of a principle of consciousness, not itself subject to\nconditions of time, upon successive appearances, such action as may\n_hold the appearances together_, without fusion, in an apprehended\nfact.\"[292]\nIt is needless to repeat that the connection of things in our\nknowledge is in no whit _explained_ by making it the deed of an agent\nwhose essence is self-identity and who is out of time. The agency\nof phenomenal thought coming and going in time is just as easy to\n_understand_. And when it is furthermore said that the agent that\ncombines is the same 'self-distinguishing subject' which 'in another\nmode of its activity' presents the manifold object to itself, the\nunintelligibilities become quite paroxysmal, and we are forced to\nconfess that the entire school of thought in question, in spite of\noccasional glimpses of something more refined, still dwells habitually\nin that mythological stage of thought where phenomena are explained\nas results of dramas enacted by entities which but reduplicate the\ncharacters of the phenomena themselves. The self must not only _know_\nits object,--that is too bald and dead a relation to be written down\nand left in its static state. The knowing must be painted as a 'famous\nvictory' in which the object's distinctness is in some way 'overcome.'\n\"The self exists as one self only as it opposes itself, as object,\nto itself as subject, and immediately denies and transcends that\nopposition. Only because it is such a concrete unity, which has in\nitself a resolved contradiction, can the intelligence cope with all\nthe manifoldness and division of the mighty universe, and hope to\nmaster its secrets. As the lightning sleeps in the dew-drop, so in\nthe simple and transparent unity of self-consciousness there is held\nin equilibrium that vital antagonism of opposites which ... seems to\nrend the world asunder. The intelligence is able to understand the\nworld, or, in other words, to break down the barrier between itself\nand things and find itself in them, just because its own existence\nis implicitly the solution of all the division and conflict of\nthings.\"[293]\nThis dynamic (I had almost written dynamitic) way of representing\nknowledge has the merit of not being tame. To turn from it to our\nown psychological formulation is like turning from the fireworks,\ntrap-doors, and transformations of the pantomime into the insipidity of\nthe midnight, where\n\"ghastly through the drizzling rain,\nOn the bald street breaks the blank day!\"[294]\nAnd yet turn we must, with the confession that our 'Thought'--a\ncognitive phenomenal event in time--is, if it exist at all, itself\nthe only Thinker which the facts require. The only service that\ntranscendental egoism has done to psychology has been by its protests\nagainst Hume's 'bundle'-theory of mind. But this service has been\nill-performed; for the Egoists themselves, let them say what they will,\nbelieve in the bundle, and in their own system merely _tie it up_,\nwith their special transcendental string, invented for that use alone.\nBesides, they talk as if, with this miraculous tying or 'relating,'\nthe Ego's duties were done. Of its far more important duty of choosing\nsome of the things it ties and appropriating them, to the exclusion of\nthe rest, they tell us never a word. To sum up, then, my own opinion\nof the transcendentalist school, it is (whatever ulterior metaphysical\ntruth it may divine) a school in which psychology at least has naught\nto learn, and whose deliverances about the Ego in particular in no wise\noblige us to revise our own formulation of the Stream of Thought.[295]\n*       *       *       *       *\nWith this, all possible rival formulations have been discussed. The\nliterature of the Self is large, but all its authors may be classed\nas radical or mitigated representatives of the three schools we have\nnamed, substantialism, associationism, or transcendentalism. Our own\nopinion must be classed apart, although it incorporates essential\nelements from all three schools. _There need never have been a quarrel\nbetween associationism and its rivals if the former had admitted the\nindecomposable unity of every pulse of thought, and the latter been\nwilling to allow that 'perishing' pulses of thought might recollect and\nknow._\nWe may sum up by saying that personality implies the incessant presence\nof two elements, an objective person, known by a passing subjective\nThought and recognized as continuing in time. _Hereafter let us use the\nwords_ ME _and_ I _for the empirical person and the judging Thought._\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Certain vicissitudes in the me demand our notice._\nIn the first place, although its changes are gradual, they become in\ntime great. The central part of the _me_ is the feeling of the body\nand of the adjustments in the head; and in the feeling of the body\nshould be included that of the general emotional tones and tendencies,\nfor at bottom these are but the habits in which organic activities\nand sensibilities run. Well, from infancy to old age, this assemblage\nof feelings, most constant of all, is yet a prey to slow mutation.\nOur powers, bodily and mental, change at least as fast.[296] Our\npossessions notoriously are perishable facts. The identity which\nthe _I_ discovers, as it surveys this long procession, can only be a\nrelative identity, that of a slow shifting in which there is always\nsome common ingredient retained.[297] The commonest element of all, the\nmost uniform, is the possession of the same memories. However different\nthe man may be from the youth, both look back on the same childhood,\nand call it their own.\nThus the identity found by the _I_ in its _me_ is only a loosely\nconstrued thing, an identity 'on the whole,' just like that which\nany outside observer might find in the same assemblage of facts. We\noften say of a man 'he is so changed one would not know him'; and so\ndoes a man, less often, speak of himself. These changes in the _me_,\nrecognized by the I, or by outside observers, may be grave or slight.\nThey deserve some notice here.\nTHE MUTATIONS OF THE SELF\nmay be divided into two main classes:\n1. Alterations of memory; and\n2. Alterations in the present bodily and spiritual selves.\n*       *       *       *       *\n1. _Alterations of memory_ are either _losses_ or false recollections.\nIn either case the _me_ is changed. Should a man be punished for what\nhe did in his childhood and no longer remembers? Should he be punished\nfor crimes enacted in post-epileptic unconsciousness, somnambulism,\nor in any involuntarily induced state of which no recollection is\nretained? Law, in accord with common-sense, says: \"No; he is not the\nsame person forensically now which he was then.\" These losses of memory\nare a normal incident of extreme old age, and the person's _me_ shrinks\nin the ratio of the facts that have disappeared.\nIn dreams we forget our waking experiences; they are as if they were\nnot. And the converse is also true. As a rule, no memory is retained\nduring the waking state of what has happened during mesmeric trance,\nalthough when again entranced the person may remember it distinctly,\nand may then forget facts belonging to the waking state. We thus have,\nwithin the bounds of healthy mental life, an approach to an alternation\nof _me's_.\nFalse memories are by no means rare occurrences in most of us, and,\nwhenever they occur, they distort the consciousness of the me. Most\npeople, probably, are in doubt about certain matters ascribed to\ntheir past. They may have seen them, may have said them, done them,\nor they may only have dreamed or imagined they did so. The content of\na dream will oftentimes insert itself into the stream of real life in\na most perplexing way. The most frequent source of false memory is\nthe accounts we give to others of our experiences. Such accounts we\nalmost always make both more simple and more interesting than the\ntruth. We quote what we should have said or done, rather than what we\nreally said or did; and in the first telling we may be fully aware\nof the distinction. But ere long the fiction expels the reality from\nmemory and reigns in its stead alone. This is one great source of the\nfallibility of testimony meant to be quite honest. Especially where\nthe marvellous is concerned, the story takes a tilt that way, and the\nmemory follows the story. Dr. Carpenter quotes from Miss Cobbe the\nfollowing, as an instance of a very common sort:\n\"It happened once to the Writer to hear a most scrupulously\nconscientious friend narrate an incident of table-turning, to which\nshe appended an assurance that the table rapped when _nobody was\nwithin a yard of it_. The writer being confounded by this latter fact,\nthe lady, though fully satisfied of the accuracy of her statement,\npromised to look at the note she had made ten years previously of\nthe transaction. The note was examined, and was found to contain\nthe distinct statement that the table rapped when _the hands of six\npersons rested on it!_ The lady's memory as to all other points proved\nto be strictly correct; and in this point she had erred in entire good\nfaith.\"[298]\nIt is next to impossible to get a story of this sort accurate in all\nits details, although it is the inessential details that suffer most\nchange.[299] Dickens and Balzac were said to have constantly mingled\ntheir fictions with their real experiences. Every one must have known\n_some_ specimen of our mortal dust so intoxicated with the thought of\nhis own person and the sound of his own voice as never to be able even\nto think the truth when his autobiography was in question. Amiable,\nharmless, radiant J. V.! mayst thou ne'er wake to the difference\nbetween thy real and thy fondly-imagined self![300]\n2. When we pass beyond alterations of memory to abnormal _alterations\nin the present self_ we have still graver disturbances. These\nalterations are of three main types, from the descriptive point of\nview. But certain cases unite features of two or more types; and our\nknowledge of the elements and causes of these changes of personality is\nso slight that the division into types must not be regarded as having\nany profound significance. The types are:\n(1) Insane delusions;\n(2) Alternating selves;\n(3) Mediumships or possessions.\n*       *       *       *       *\n1) In insanity we often have delusions projected into the past, which\nare melancholic or sanguine according to the character of the disease.\nBut the worst alterations of the self come from present perversions\nof sensibility and impulse which leave the past undisturbed, but\ninduce the patient to think that the present _me_ is an altogether\nnew personage. Something of this sort happens normally in the rapid\nexpansion of the whole character, intellectual as well as volitional,\nwhich takes place after the time of puberty. The pathological cases are\ncurious enough to merit longer notice.\nThe basis of our personality, as M. Ribot says, is that feeling of our\nvitality which, because it is so perpetually present, remains in the\nbackground of our consciousness.\n\"It is the basis because, always present, always acting, without\npeace or rest, it knows neither sleep nor fainting, and lasts as long\nas life itself, of which it is one form. It serves as a support to\nthat self-conscious _me_ which memory constitutes, it is the medium\nof association among its other parts.... Suppose now that it were\npossible at once to change our body and put another into its place:\nskeleton, vessels, viscera, muscles, skin, everything made new, except\nthe nervous system with its stored-up memory of the past. There can\nbe no doubt that in such a case the afflux of unaccustomed vital\nsensations would produce the gravest disorders. Between the old sense\nof existence engraved on the nervous system, and the new one acting\nwith all the intensity of its reality and novelty, there would be\nirreconcilable contradiction.\"[301]\nWith the beginnings of cerebral disease there often happens something\nquite comparable to this:\n\"Masses of new sensation, hitherto foreign to the individual, impulses\nand ideas of the same inexperienced kind, for example terrors,\nrepresentations of enacted crime, of enemies pursuing one, etc. At\nthe outset, these stand in contrast with the old familiar _me_, as\na strange, often astonishing and abhorrent _thou_.[302] Often their\ninvasion into the former circle of feelings is felt as if the old\nself were being taken possession of by a dark overpowering might,\nand the fact of such 'possession' is described in fantastic images.\nAlways this doubleness, this struggle of the old self against the\nnew discordant forms of experience, is accompanied with painful\nmental conflict, with passion, with violent emotional excitement.\nThis is in great part the reason for the common experience, that the\nfirst stage in the immense majority of cases of mental disease is an\nemotional alteration particularly of a melancholic sort. If now the\nbrain-affection, which is the immediate cause of the new abnormal\ntrain of ideas, be not relieved, the latter becomes confirmed.\nIt may gradually contract associations with the trains of ideas\nwhich characterized the old self, or portions of the latter may be\nextinguished and lost in the progress of the cerebral malady, so\nthat little by little the opposition of the two conscious _me's_\nabates, and the emotional storms are calmed. But by that time _the\nold me itself has been falsified and turned into another_ by those\nassociations, by that reception into itself of the abnormal elements\nof feeling and of will. The patient may again be quiet, and his\nthought sometimes logically correct, but in it the morbid erroneous\nideas are always present, with the adhesions they have contracted,\nas uncontrollable premises, and the man is no longer the same, but a\nreally new person, his old self transformed.\"[303]\nBut the patient himself rarely continues to describe the change in just\nthese terms unless new _bodily sensations_ in him or the loss of old\nones play a predominant part. Mere perversions of sight and hearing, or\neven of impulse, soon cease to be felt as contradictions of the unity\nof the me.\nWhat the particular perversions of the bodily sensibility may be, which\ngive rise to these contradictions, is for the most part impossible for\na sound-minded person to conceive. One patient has another self that\nrepeats all his thoughts for him. Others, among whom are some of the\nfirst characters in history, have familiar d\u00e6mons who speak with them,\nand are replied to. In another someone 'makes' his thoughts for him.\nAnother has two bodies, lying in different beds. Some patients feel as\nif they had lost parts of their bodies, teeth, brain, stomach, etc. In\nsome it is made of wood, glass, butter, etc. In some it does not exist\nany longer, or is dead, or is a foreign object quite separate from the\nspeaker's self. Occasionally, parts of the body lose their connection\nfor consciousness with the rest, and are treated as belonging to\nanother person and moved by a hostile will. Thus the right hand may\nfight with the left as with an enemy.[304] Or the cries of the patient\nhimself are assigned to another person with whom the patient expresses\nsympathy. The literature of insanity is filled with narratives of such\nillusions as these. M. Taine quotes from a patient of Dr. Krishaber an\naccount of sufferings, from which it will be seen how completely aloof\nfrom what is normal a man's experience may suddenly become:\n\"After the first or second day it was for some weeks impossible\nto observe or analyze myself. The suffering--angina pectoris--was\ntoo overwhelming. It was not till the first days of January that I\ncould give an account to myself of what I experienced.... Here is\nthe first thing of which I retain a clear remembrance. I was alone,\nand already a prey to permanent visual trouble, when I was suddenly\nseized with a visual trouble infinitely more pronounced. Objects grew\nsmall and receded to infinite distances--men and things together.\nI was myself immeasurably far away, I looked about me with terror\nand astonishment; _the world was escaping from me_.... I remarked at\nthe same time that my voice was extremely far away from me, that it\nsounded no longer as if mine. I struck the ground with my foot, and\nperceived its resistance; but this resistance seemed illusory--not\nthat the soil was soft, but that the weight of my body was reduced to\nalmost nothing.... I had the feeling of being without weight....\" In\naddition to being so distant, \"objects appeared to me _flat_. When\nI spoke with anyone, I saw him like an image cut out of paper with\nno relief.... This sensation lasted intermittently for two years....\nConstantly it seemed as if my legs did not belong to me. It was almost\nas bad with my arms. As for my head, it seemed no longer to exist....\nI appeared to myself to act automatically, by an impulsion foreign\nto myself.... There was inside of me a new being, and another part\nof myself, the old being, which took no interest in the new-comer.\nI distinctly remember saying to myself that the sufferings of this\nnew being were to me indifferent. I was never really dupe of these\nillusions, but my mind grew often tired of incessantly correcting the\nnew impressions, and I let myself go and lived the unhappy life of\nthis new entity. I had an ardent desire to see my old world again, to\nget back to my old self. This desire kept me from killing myself....\nI was another, and I hated, I despised this other; he was perfectly\nodious to me; it was certainly another who had taken my form and\nassumed my functions.\"[305]\nIn cases similar to this, it is as certain that the _I_ is unaltered as\nthat the _me_ is changed. That is to say, the present Thought of the\npatient is cognitive of both the old _me_ and the new, so long as its\nmemory holds good. Only, within that objective sphere which formerly\nlent itself so simply to the judgment of recognition and of egoistic\nappropriation, strange perplexities have arisen. The present and the\npast both seen therein will not unite. Where is my old me? What is this\nnew one? Are they the same? Or have I two? Such questions, answered by\nwhatever theory the patient is able to conjure up as plausible, form\nthe beginning of his insane life.[306]\nA case with which I am acquainted through Dr. C. J. Fisher of Tewksbury\nhas possibly its origin in this way. The woman, Bridget F.,\n\"has been many years insane, and always speaks of her supposed self\nas 'the rat,' asking me to 'bury the little rat,' etc. Her real self\nshe speaks of in the third person as 'the good woman,' saying, 'The\ngood Woman knew Dr. F. and used to work for him,' etc. Sometimes she\nsadly asks: 'Do you think the good woman will ever come back?' She\nworks at needlework, knitting, laundry, etc., and shows her work,\nsaying, 'Isn't that good for only a rat?' She has, during periods of\ndepression, hid herself under buildings, and crawled into holes and\nunder boxes. 'She was only a rat, and wants to die,' she would say\nwhen we found her.\"\n2. The phenomenon of _alternating personality_ in its simplest\nphases seems based on lapses of memory. Any man becomes, as we say,\n_inconsistent_ with himself if he forgets his engagements, pledges,\nknowledges, and habits; and it is merely a question of degree at\nwhat point we shall say that his personality is changed. In the\npathological cases known as those of double or alternate personality\nthe lapse of memory is abrupt, and is usually preceded by a period of\nunconsciousness or syncope lasting a variable length of time. In the\nhypnotic trance we can easily produce an alteration of the personality,\neither by telling the subject to forget all that has happened to him\nsince such or such a date, in which case he becomes (it may be) a child\nagain, or by telling him he is another altogether imaginary personage,\nin which case all facts about himself seem for the time being to lapse\nfrom out his mind, and he throws himself into the new character with a\nvivacity proportionate to the amount of histrionic imagination which\nhe possesses.[307] But in the pathological cases the transformation is\nspontaneous. The most famous case, perhaps, on record is that of F\u00e9lida\nX., reported by Dr. Azam of Bordeaux.[308] At the age of fourteen this\nwoman began to pass into a 'secondary' state characterized by a change\nin her general disposition and character, as if certain 'inhibitions,'\npreviously existing, were suddenly removed. During the secondary state\nshe remembered the first state, but on emerging from it into the first\nstate she remembered nothing of the second. At the age of forty-four\nthe duration of the secondary state (which was on the whole superior in\nquality to the original state) had gained upon the latter so much as to\noccupy most of her time. During it she remembers the events belonging\nto the original state, but her complete oblivion of the secondary state\nwhen the original state recurs is often very distressing to her, as,\nfor example, when the transition takes place in a carriage on her way\nto a funeral, and she hasn't the least idea which one of her friends\nmay be dead. She actually became pregnant during one of her early\nsecondary states, and during her first state had no knowledge of how it\nhad come to pass. Her distress at these blanks of memory is sometimes\nintense and once drove her to attempt suicide.\nTo take another example, Dr. Rieger gives an account[309] of an\nepileptic man who for seventeen years had passed his life alternately\nfree, in prisons, or in asylums, his character being orderly enough in\nthe normal state, but alternating with periods, during which he would\nleave his home for several weeks, leading the life of a thief and\nvagabond, being sent to jail, having epileptic fits and excitement,\nbeing accused of malingering, etc., etc., and with never a memory of\nthe abnormal conditions which were to blame for all his wretchedness.\n\"I have never got from anyone,\" says Dr. Rieger, \"so singular an\nimpression as from this man, of whom it could not be said that he\nhad any properly conscious past at all.... It is really impossible\nto think one's self into such a state of mind. His last larceny had\nbeen performed in N\u00fcrnberg, he knew nothing of it, and saw himself\nbefore the court and then in the hospital, but without in the least\nunderstanding the reason why. That he had epileptic attacks, he knew.\nBut it was impossible to convince him that for hours together he raved\nand acted in an abnormal way.\"\nAnother remarkable case is that of Mary Reynolds, lately republished\nagain by Dr. Weir Mitchell.[310] This dull and melancholy young woman,\ninhabiting the Pennsylvania wilderness in 1811,\n\"was found one morning, long after her habitual time for rising, in\na profound sleep from which it was impossible to arouse her. After\neighteen or twenty hours of sleeping she awakened, but in a state of\nunnatural consciousness. Memory had fled. To all intents and purposes\nshe was as a being for the first time ushered into the world. 'All\nof the past that remained to her was the faculty of pronouncing a\nfew words, and this seems to have been as purely instinctive as the\nwailings of an infant; for at first the words which she uttered were\nconnected with no ideas in her mind.' Until she was taught their\nsignificance they were unmeaning sounds.\n\"'Her eyes were virtually for the first time opened upon the world.\nOld things had passed away; all things had become new.' Her parents,\nbrothers, sisters, friends, were not recognized or acknowledged as\nsuch by her. She had never seen them before,--never known them,--was\nnot aware that such persons had been. Now for the first time she was\nintroduced to their company and acquaintance. To the scenes by which\nshe was surrounded she was a perfect stranger. The house, the fields,\nthe forest, the hills, the vales, the streams,--all were novelties.\nThe beauties of the landscape were all unexplored.\n\"She had not the slightest consciousness that she had ever existed\nprevious to the moment in which she awoke from that mysterious\nslumber. 'In a word, she was an infant, just born, yet born in a\nstate of maturity, with a capacity for relishing the rich, sublime,\nluxuriant wonders of created nature.'\n\"The first lesson in her education was to teach her by what ties\nshe was bound to those by whom she was surrounded, and the duties\ndevolving upon her accordingly. This she was very slow to learn, and,\n'indeed, never did learn, or, at least, never would acknowledge the\nties of consanguinity, or scarcely those of friendship. She considered\nthose she had once known as for the most part strangers and enemies,\namong whom she was, by some remarkable and unaccountable means,\ntransplanted, though from what region or state of existence was a\nproblem unsolved.'\n\"The next lesson was to re-teach her the arts of reading and writing.\nShe was apt enough, and made such rapid progress in both that _in a_\n_few weeks_ she had readily re-learned to read and write. In copying\nher name which her brother had written for her as a first lesson, she\ntook her pen in a very awkward manner and began to copy from right to\nleft in the Hebrew mode, as though she had been transplanted from an\nEastern soil....\n\"The next thing that is noteworthy is the change which took place in\nher disposition. Instead of being melancholy she was now cheerful\nto extremity. Instead of being reserved she was buoyant and social.\nFormerly taciturn and retiring, she was now merry and jocose. Her\ndisposition was totally and absolutely changed. While she was, in\nthis second state, extravagantly fond of company, she was much more\nenamoured of nature's works, as exhibited in the forests, hills,\nvales, and water-courses. She used to start in the morning, either on\nfoot or horseback, and ramble until nightfall over the whole country;\nnor was she at all particular whether she were on a path or in the\ntrackless forest. Her predilection for this manner of life may have\nbeen occasioned by the restraint necessarily imposed upon her by\nher friends, which caused her to consider them her enemies and not\ncompanions, and she was glad to keep out of their way.\n\"She knew no fear, and as bears and panthers were numerous in the\nwoods, and rattlesnakes and copperheads abounded everywhere, her\nfriends told her of the danger to which she exposed herself, but it\nproduced no other effect than to draw forth a contemptuous laugh,\nas she said, 'I know you only want to frighten me and keep me at\nhome, but you miss it, for I often see your bears and I am perfectly\nconvinced that they are nothing more than black hogs.'\n\"One evening, after her return from her daily excursion, she told the\nfollowing incident: 'As I was riding to-day along a narrow path a\ngreat black hog came out of the woods and stopped before me. I never\nsaw such an impudent black hog before. It stood up on its hind feet\nand grinned and gnashed its teeth at me. I could not make the horse\ngo on. I told him he was a fool to be frightened at a hog, and tried\nto whip him past, but he would not go and wanted to turn back. I told\nthe hog to get out of the way, but he did not mind me. \"Well,\" said\nI, \"if you won't for words, I'll try blows;\" so I got off and took a\nstick, and walked up toward it. When I got pretty close by, it got\ndown on all fours and walked away slowly and sullenly, stopping every\nfew steps and looking back and grinning and growling. Then I got on my\nhorse and rode on.'...\n\"Thus it continued for five weeks, when one morning, after a\nprotracted sleep, she awoke and was herself again. She recognized\nthe parental, the brotherly, and sisterly ties as though nothing\nhad happened, and immediately went about the performance of duties\nincumbent upon her, and which she had planned five weeks previously.\nGreat was her surprise at the change which one night (as she supposed)\nhad produced. Nature bore a different aspect. Not a trace was left\nin her mind of the giddy scenes through which she had passed. Her\nramblings through the forest, her tricks and humor, all were faded\nfrom her memory, and not a shadow left behind. Her parents saw their\nchild; her brothers and sisters saw their sister. She now had all the\nknowledge that she had possessed in her first state previous to the\nchange, still fresh and in as vigorous exercise as though no change\nhad been. But any new acquisitions she had made, and any new ideas\nshe had obtained, were lost to her now--yet not lost, but laid up\nout of sight in safe-keeping for future use. Of course her natural\ndisposition returned; her melancholy was deepened by the information\nof what had occurred. All went on in the old-fashioned way, and it was\nfondly hoped that the mysterious occurrences of those five weeks would\nnever be repeated, but these anticipations were not to be realized.\nAfter the lapse of a few weeks she fell into a profound sleep, and\nawoke in her second state, taking up her new life again precisely\nwhere she had left it when she before passed from that state. She was\nnot now a daughter or a sister. All the knowledge she possessed was\nthat acquired during the few weeks of her former period of second\nconsciousness. She knew nothing of the intervening time. Two periods\nwidely separated were brought into contact. She thought it was but one\nnight.\n\"In this state she came to understand perfectly the facts of her case,\nnot from memory, but from information. Yet her buoyancy of spirits was\nso great that no depression was produced. On the contrary, it added to\nher cheerfulness, and was made the foundation, as was everything else,\nof mirth.\n\"These alternations from one state to another continued at intervals\nof varying length for fifteen or sixteen years, but finally ceased\nwhen she attained the age of thirty-five or thirty-six, leaving her\n_permanently in her second state_. In this she remained without change\nfor the last quarter of a century of her life.\"\nThe emotional opposition of the two states seems, however, to have\nbecome gradually effaced in Mary Reynolds:\n\"The change from a gay, hysterical, mischievous woman, fond of\njests and subject to absurd beliefs or delusive convictions, to\none retaining the joyousness and love of society, but sobered down\nto levels of practical usefulness, was gradual. The most of the\ntwenty-five years which followed she was as different from her\nmelancholy, morbid self as from the hilarious condition of the early\nyears of her second state. Some of her family spoke of it as her\nthird state. She is described as becoming rational, industrious, and\nvery cheerful, yet reasonably serious; possessed of a well-balanced\ntemperament, and not having the slightest indication of an injured or\ndisturbed mind. For some years she taught school, and in that capacity\nwas both useful and acceptable, being a general favorite with old and\nyoung.\n\"During these last twenty-five years she lived in the same house with\nthe Rev. Dr. John V. Reynolds, her nephew, part of that time keeping\nhouse for him, showing a sound judgment and a thorough acquaintance\nwith the duties of her position.\n\"Dr. Reynolds, who is still living in Meadville,\" says Dr. Mitchell,\n\"and who has most kindly placed the facts at my disposal, states in\nhis letter to me of January 4, 1888, that at a later period of her\nlife she said she did sometimes seem to have a dim, dreamy idea of\na shadowy past, which she could not fully grasp, and could not be\ncertain whether it originated in a partially restored memory or in the\nstatements of the events by others during her abnormal state.\n\"Miss Reynolds died in January, 1854, at the age of sixty-one. On the\nmorning of the day of her death she rose in her usual health, ate her\nbreakfast, and superintended household duties. While thus employed she\nsuddenly raised her hands to her head and exclaimed: 'Oh! I wonder\nwhat is the matter with my head!' and immediately fell to the floor.\nWhen carried to a sofa she gasped once or twice and died.\"\nIn such cases as the preceding, in which the secondary character is\nsuperior to the first, there seems reason to think that the first one\nis the morbid one. The word _inhibition_ describes its dulness and\nmelancholy. F\u00e9lida X.'s original character was dull and melancholy in\ncomparison with that which she later acquired, and the change may be\nregarded as the removal of inhibitions which had maintained themselves\nfrom earlier years. Such inhibitions we all know temporarily, when we\ncan not recollect or in some other way command our mental resources.\nThe systematized amnesias (losses of memory) of hypnotic subjects\nordered to forget all nouns, or all verbs, or a particular letter\nof the alphabet, or all that is relative to a certain person, are\ninhibitions of the sort on a more extensive scale. They sometimes\noccur spontaneously as symptoms of disease.[311] Now M. Pierre Janet\nhas shown that such inhibitions when they bear on a certain class of\nsensations (making the subject an\u00e6sthetic thereto) and also on the\nmemory of such sensations, are the basis of changes of personality.\nThe an\u00e6sthetic and 'amnesic' hysteric is one person; but when you\nrestore her inhibited sensibilities and memories by plunging her into\nthe hypnotic trance--in other words, when you rescue them from their\n'dissociated' and split-off condition, and make them rejoin the other\nsensibilities and memories--she is a different person. As said above\n(p. 203), the hypnotic trance is one method of restoring sensibility\nin hysterics. But one day when the hysteric an\u00e6sthetic named Lucie was\nalready in the hypnotic trance, M. Janet for a certain reason continued\nto make passes over her for a full half-hour as if she were not already\nasleep. The result was to throw her into a sort of syncope from which,\nafter half an hour, she revived in a second somnambulic condition\nentirely unlike that which had characterized her thitherto--different\nsensibilities, a different memory, a different person, in short. In\nthe waking state the poor young woman was an\u00e6sthetic all over, nearly\ndeaf, and with a badly contracted field of vision. Bad as it was,\nhowever, sight was her best sense, and she used it as a guide in all\nher movements. With her eyes bandaged she became entirely helpless, and\nlike other persons of a similar sort whose cases have been recorded,\nshe almost immediately fell asleep in consequence of the withdrawal\nof her last sensorial stimulus. M. Janet calls this waking or primary\n(one can hardly in such a connection say 'normal') state by the\nname of Lucie 1. In Lucie 2, her first sort of hypnotic trance, the\nan\u00e6sthesias were diminished but not removed. In the deeper trance,\n'Lucie 3,' brought about as just described, no trace of them remained.\nHer sensibility became perfect, and instead of being an extreme example\nof the 'visual' type, she was transformed into what in Prof. Charcot's\nterminology is known as a motor. That is to say, that whereas when\nawake she had thought in visual terms exclusively, and could imagine\nthings only by remembering how they _looked_, now in this deeper trance\nher thoughts and memories seemed to M. Janet to be largely composed of\nimages of movement and of touch.\nHaving discovered this deeper trance and change of personality in\nLucie, M. Janet naturally became eager to find it in his other\nsubjects. He found it in Rose, in Marie, and in L\u00e9onie; and his\nbrother, Dr. Jules Janet, who was _interne_ at the Salp\u00e9tri\u00e8re\nHospital, found it in the celebrated subject Wit.... whose trances had\nbeen studied for years by the various doctors of that institution\nwithout any of them having happened to awaken this very peculiar\nindividuality.[312]\nWith the return of all the sensibilities in the deeper trance, these\nsubjects turned, as it were, into normal persons. Their memories\nin particular grew more extensive, and hereupon M. Janet spins a\ntheoretic generalization. _When a certain kind of sensation_, he says,\n_is abolished in an hysteric patient, there is also abolished along\nwith it all recollection of past sensations of that kind_. If, for\nexample, hearing be the an\u00e6sthetic sense, the patient becomes unable\neven to imagine sounds and voices, and has to speak (when speech is\nstill possible) by means of motor or articulatory cues. If the motor\nsense be abolished, the patient must will the movements of his limbs\nby first defining them to his mind in visual terms, and must innervate\nhis voice by premonitory ideas of the way in which the words are going\nto sound. The practical consequences of this law would be great, for\nall experiences belonging to a sphere of sensibility which afterwards\nbecame an\u00e6sthetic, as, for example, touch, would have been stored away\nand remembered in tactile terms, and would be incontinently forgotten\nas soon as the cutaneous and muscular sensibility should come to be cut\nout in the course of disease. Memory of them would be restored again,\non the other hand, so soon as the sense of touch came back. Now, in the\nhysteric subjects on whom M. Janet experimented, touch did come back in\nthe state of trance. The result was that all sorts of memories, absent\nin the ordinary condition, came back too, and they could then go back\nand explain the origin of many otherwise inexplicable things in their\nlife. One stage in the great convulsive crisis of hystero-epilepsy,\nfor example, is what French writers call the _phase des attitudes\npassionelles_, in which the patient, without speaking or giving any\naccount of herself, will go through the outward movements of fear,\nanger, or some other emotional state of mind. Usually this phase is,\nwith each patient, a thing so stereotyped as to seem automatic, and\ndoubts have even been expressed as to whether any consciousness exists\nwhilst it lasts. When, however, the patient Lucie's tactile sensibility\ncame back in the deeper trance, she explained the origin of her\nhysteric crisis in a great fright which she had had when a child, on\na day when certain men, hid behind the curtains, had jumped out upon\nher; she told how she went through this scene again in all her crises;\nshe told of her sleep-walking fits through the house when a child, and\nhow for several months she had been shut in a dark room because of a\ndisorder of the eyes. All these were things of which she recollected\nnothing when awake, because they were records of experiences mainly of\nmotion and of touch.\nBut M. Janet's subject L\u00e9onie is interesting, and shows best how with\nthe sensibilities and motor impulses the memories and character will\nchange.\n\"This woman, whose life sounds more like an improbable romance than\na genuine history, has had attacks of natural somnambulism since the\nage of three years. She has been hypnotized constantly by all sorts of\npersons from the age of sixteen upwards, and she is now forty-five.\nWhilst her normal life developed in one way in the midst of her poor\ncountry surroundings, her second life was passed in drawing-rooms and\ndoctors' offices, and naturally took an entirely different direction.\nTo-day, when in her normal state, this poor peasant woman is a serious\nand rather sad person, calm and slow, very mild with every one, and\nextremely timid: to look at her one would never suspect the personage\nwhich she contains. But hardly is she put to sleep hypnotically\nwhen a metamorphosis occurs. Her face is no longer the same. She\nkeeps her eyes closed, it is true, but the acuteness of her other\nsenses supplies their place. She is gay, noisy, restless, sometimes\ninsupportably so. She remains good-natured, but has acquired a\nsingular tendency to irony and sharp jesting. Nothing is more curious\nthan to hear her after a sitting when she has received a visit from\nstrangers who wished to see her asleep. She gives a word-portrait of\nthem, apes their manners, pretends to know their little ridiculous\naspects and passions, and for each invents a romance. To this\ncharacter must be added the possession of an enormous number of\nrecollections, whose existence she does not even suspect when awake,\nfor her amnesia is then complete.... She refuses the name of L\u00e9onie\nand takes that of L\u00e9ontine (L\u00e9onie 2) to which her first magnetizers\nhad accustomed her. 'That good woman is not myself,' she says, 'she\nis too stupid!' To herself, L\u00e9ontine or L\u00e9onie 2, she attributes\nall the sensations and all the actions, in a word all the conscious\nexperiences which she has undergone _in somnambulism_, and knits them\ntogether to make the history of her already long life. To L\u00e9onie 1 [as\nM. Janet calls the waking woman] on the other hand, she exclusively\nascribes the events lived through in waking hours. I was at first\nstruck by an important exception to the rule, and was disposed to\nthink that there might be something arbitrary in this partition of her\nrecollections. In the normal state L\u00e9onie has a husband and children;\nbut L\u00e9onie 2, the somnambulist, whilst acknowledging the children\nas her own, attributes the husband to 'the other.' This choice, was\nperhaps explicable, but it followed no rule. It was not till later\nthat I learned that her magnetizers in early days, as audacious\nas certain hypnotizers of recent date, had somnambulized her for\nher first _accouchements_, and that she had lapsed into that state\nspontaneously in the later ones. L\u00e9onie 2 was thus quite right in\nascribing to herself the children--it was she who had had them, and\nthe rule that her first trance-state forms a different personality was\nnot broken. But it is the same with her second or deepest state of\ntrance. When after the renewed passes, syncope, etc., she reaches the\ncondition which I have called L\u00e9onie 3, she is another person still.\nSerious and grave, instead of being a restless child, she speaks\nslowly and moves but little. Again she separates herself from the\nwaking L\u00e9onie 1. 'A good but rather stupid woman,' she says, 'and not\nme.' And she also separates herself from L\u00e9onie 2: 'How can you see\nanything of me in that crazy creature?' she says. 'Fortunately I am\nnothing for her.'\"\nL\u00e9onie 1 knows only of herself; L\u00e9onie 2, of herself and of L\u00e9onie 1;\nL\u00e9onie 3 knows of herself and of both the others. L\u00e9onie 1 has a visual\nconsciousness; L\u00e9onie 2 has one both visual and auditory; in L\u00e9onie 3\nit is at once visual, auditory, and tactile. Prof. Janet thought at\nfirst that he was L\u00e9onie 3's discoverer. But she told him that she had\nbeen frequently in that condition before. A former magnetizer had hit\nupon her just as M. Janet had, in seeking by means of passes to deepen\nthe sleep of L\u00e9onie 2.\n\"This resurrection of a somnambulic personage who had been extinct\nfor twenty years is curious enough; and in speaking to L\u00e9onie 3, I\nnaturally now adopt the name of L\u00e9onore which was given her by her\nfirst master.\"\nThe most carefully studied case of multiple personality is that of the\nhysteric youth Louis V. about whom MM. Bourru and Burot have written a\nbook.[313] The symptoms are too intricate to be reproduced here with\ndetail. Suffice it that Louis V. had led an irregular life, in the\narmy, in hospitals, and in houses of correction, and had had numerous\nhysteric an\u00e6sthesias, paralyses, and contractures attacking him\ndifferently at different times and when he lived at different places.\nAt eighteen, at an agricultural House of Correction he was bitten by\na viper, which brought on a convulsive crisis and left _both of his\nlegs_ paralyzed for three years. During this condition he was gentle,\nmoral, and industrious. But suddenly at last, after a long convulsive\nseizure, his paralysis disappeared, and with it his memory for all the\ntime during which it had endured. His character also changed: he became\nquarrelsome, gluttonous, impolite, stealing his comrades' wine, and\nmoney from an attendant, and finally escaped from the establishment\nand fought furiously when he was overtaken and caught. Later, when\nhe first fell under the observation of the authors, his _right side_\nwas half paralyzed and insensible, and his character intolerable; the\napplication of metals transferred the paralysis to the _left_ side,\nabolished his recollections of the other condition, and carried him\npsychically back to the hospital of Bic\u00eatre where he had been treated\nfor a similar physical condition. His character, opinions, education,\nall underwent a concomitant transformation. He was no longer the\npersonage of the moment before. It appeared ere long that any present\nnervous disorder in him could be temporarily removed by metals,\nmagnets, electric or other baths, etc.; and that any past disorder\ncould be brought back by hypnotic suggestion. He also went through a\nrapid spontaneous repetition of his series of past disorders after\neach of the convulsive attacks which occurred in him at intervals.\nIt was observed that each physical state in which he found himself,\nexcluded certain memories and brought with it a definite modification\nof character.\n\"The law of these changes,\" say the authors, \"is quite clear. There\nexist precise, constant, and necessary relations between the bodily\nand the mental state, such that it is impossible to modify the one\nwithout modifying the other in a parallel fashion.\"[314]\nThe case of this proteiform individual would seem, then, nicely to\ncorroborate M. P. Janet's law that an\u00e6sthesias and gaps in memory go\ntogether. Coupling Janet's law with Locke's that changes of memory\nbring changes of personality, we should have an apparent explanation\nof some cases at least of alternate personality. But mere an\u00e6sthesia\ndoes not sufficiently explain the changes of disposition, which\nare probably due to modifications in the perviousness of motor and\nassociative paths, co-ordinate with those of the sensorial paths rather\nthan consecutive upon them. And indeed a glance at other cases than M.\nJanet's own, suffices to show us that sensibility and memory are not\ncoupled in any invariable way.[315] M. Janet's law, true of his own\ncases, does not seem to hold good in all.\nOf course it is mere guesswork to speculate on what may be the cause of\nthe amnesias which lie at the bottom of changes in the Self. Changes\nof blood-supply have naturally been invoked. Alternate action of the\ntwo hemispheres was long ago proposed by Dr. Wigan in his book on\nthe Duality of the Mind. I shall revert to this explanation after\nconsidering the third class of alterations of the Self, those, namely,\nwhich I have called 'possessions.'\nI have myself become quite recently acquainted with the subject of a\ncase of alternate personality of the 'ambulatory' sort, who has given\nme permission to name him in these pages.[316]\nThe Rev. Ansel Bourne, of Greene, R. I., was brought up to the trade\nof a carpenter; but, in consequence of a sudden temporary loss,\nof sight and hearing under very peculiar circumstances, he became\nconverted from Atheism to Christianity just before his thirtieth\nyear, and has since that time for the most part lived the life of an\nitinerant preacher. He has been subject to headaches and temporary\nfits of depression of spirits during most of his life, and has had a\nfew fits of unconsciousness lasting an hour or less. He also has a\nregion of somewhat diminished cutaneous sensibility on the left thigh.\nOtherwise his health is good, and his muscular strength and endurance\nexcellent. He is of a firm and self-reliant disposition, a man whose\nyea is yea and his nay, nay; and his character for uprightness is such\nin the community that no person who knows him will for a moment admit\nthe possibility of his case not being perfectly genuine.\nOn January 17, 1887, he drew 551 dollars from a bank in Providence\nwith which to pay for a certain lot of land in Greene, paid certain\nbills, and got into a Pawtucket horse-car. This is the last incident\nwhich he remembers. He did not return home that day, and nothing\nwas heard of him for two months. He was published in the papers as\nmissing, and foul play being suspected, the police sought in vain his\nwhereabouts. On the morning of March 14th, however, at Norristown,\nPennsylvania, a man calling himself A. J. Brown, who had rented\na small shop six weeks previously, stocked it with stationery,\nconfectionery, fruit and small articles, and carried on his quiet\ntrade without seeming to any one unnatural or eccentric, woke up in a\nfright and called in the people of the house to tell him where he was.\nHe said that his name was Ansel Bourne, that he was entirely ignorant\nof Norristown, that he knew nothing of shop-keeping, and that the last\nthing he remembered--it seemed only yesterday--was drawing the money\nfrom the bank, etc., in Providence. He would not believe that two\nmonths had elapsed. The people of the house thought him insane; and\nso, at first, did Dr. Louis H. Read, whom they called in to see him.\nBut on telegraphing to Providence, confirmatory messages came, and\npresently his nephew, Mr. Andrew Harris, arrived upon the scene, made\neverything straight, and took him home. He was very weak, having lost\napparently over twenty pounds of flesh during his escapade, and had\nsuch a horror of the idea of the candy-store that he refused to set\nfoot in it again.\nThe first two weeks of the period remained unaccounted for, as he had\nno memory, after he had once resumed his normal personality, of any\npart of the time, and no one who knew him seems to have seen him\nafter he left home. The remarkable part of the change is, of course,\nthe peculiar occupation which the so-called Brown indulged in. Mr.\nBourne has never in his life had the slightest contact with trade.\n'Brown' was described by the neighbors as taciturn, orderly in his\nhabits, and in no way queer. He went to Philadelphia several times;\nreplenished his stock; cooked for himself in the back shop, where he\nalso slept; went regularly to church; and once at a prayer-meeting\nmade what was considered by the hearers a good address, in the course\nof which he related an incident which he had witnessed in his natural\nstate of Bourne.\nThis was all that was known of the case up to June 1890, when I\ninduced Mr. Bourne to submit to hypnotism, so as to see whether, in\nthe hypnotic trance, his 'Brown' memory would not come back. It did\nso with surprising readiness; so much so indeed that it proved quite\nimpossible to make him whilst in the hypnosis remember any of the\nfacts of his normal life. He had heard of Ansel Bourne, but \"didn't\nknow as he had ever met the man.\" When confronted with Mrs. Bourne\nhe said that he had \"never seen the woman before,\" etc. On the other\nhand, he told of his peregrinations during the lost fortnight,[317]\nand gave all sorts of details about the Norristown episode. The whole\nthing was prosaic enough; and the Brown-personality seems to be\nnothing but a rather shrunken, dejected, and amnesic extract of Mr.\nBourne himself. He gives no motive for the wandering except that there\nwas 'trouble back there' and he 'wanted rest.' During the trance he\nlooks old, the corners of his mouth are drawn down, his voice is slow\nand weak, and he sits screening his eyes and trying vainly to remember\nwhat lay before and after the two months of the Brown experience. \"I'm\nall hedged in,\" he says: \"I can't get out at either end. I don't know\nwhat set me down in that Pawtucket horse-car, and I don't know how I\never left that store, or what became of it.\" His eyes are practically\nnormal, and all his sensibilities (save for tardier response) about\nthe same in hypnosis as in waking. I had hoped by suggestion, etc., to\nrun the two personalities into one, and make the memories continuous,\nbut no artifice would avail to accomplish this, and Mr. Bourne's skull\nto-day still covers two distinct personal selves.\nThe case (whether it contain an epileptic element or not) should\napparently be classed as one of spontaneous hypnotic trance,\npersisting for two months. The peculiarity of it is that nothing else\nlike it ever occurred in the man's life, and that no eccentricity of\ncharacter came out. In most similar cases, the attacks recur, and the\nsensibilities and conduct markedly change.[318]\n*       *       *       *       *\n3. In '_mediumships_' or '_possessions_' the invasion and the passing\naway of the secondary state are both relatively abrupt, and the\nduration of the state is usually short--i.e., from a few minutes to a\nfew hours. Whenever the secondary state is well developed no memory for\naught that happened during it remains after the primary consciousness\ncomes back. The subject during the secondary consciousness speaks,\nwrites, or acts as if animated by a foreign person, and often names\nthis foreign person and gives his history. In old times the foreign\n'control' was usually a demon, and is so now in communities which favor\nthat belief. With us he gives himself out at the worst for an Indian or\nother grotesquely speaking but harmless personage. Usually he purports\nto be the spirit of a dead person known or unknown to those present,\nand the subject is then what we call a 'medium.' Mediumistic possession\nin all its grades seems to form a perfectly natural special type of\nalternate personality, and the susceptibility to it in some form is\nby no means an uncommon gift, in persons who have no other obvious\nnervous anomaly. The phenomena are very intricate, and are only just\nbeginning to be studied in a proper scientific way. The lowest phase\nof mediumship is automatic writing, and the lowest grade of that is\nwhere the Subject knows what words are coming, but feels impelled to\nwrite them as if from without. Then comes writing unconsciously, even\nwhilst engaged in reading or talk. Inspirational speaking, playing on\nmusical instruments, etc., also belong to the relatively lower phases\nof possession, in which the normal self is not excluded from conscious\nparticipation in the performance, though their initiative seems to come\nfrom elsewhere. In the highest phase the trance is complete, the voice,\nlanguage, and everything are changed, and there is no after-memory\nwhatever until the next trance comes. One curious thing about\ntrance-utterances is their generic similarity in different individuals.\nThe 'control' here in America is either a grotesque, slangy, and\nflippant personage ('Indian' controls, calling the ladies 'squaws,'\nthe men 'braves,' the house a 'wigwam,' etc., etc., are excessively\ncommon); or, if he ventures on higher intellectual flights, he abounds\nin a curiously vague optimistic philosophy-and-water, in which phrases\nabout spirit, harmony, beauty, law, progression, development, etc.,\nkeep recurring. It seems exactly as if one author composed more than\nhalf of the trance-messages, no matter by whom they are uttered.\nWhether all sub-conscious selves are peculiarly susceptible to a\ncertain stratum of the _Zeitgeist_, and get their inspiration from it,\nI know not; but this is obviously the case with the secondary selves\nwhich become 'developed' in spiritualist circles. There the beginnings\nof the medium trance are indistinguishable from effects of hypnotic\nsuggestion. The subject assumes the r\u00f4le of a medium simply because\nopinion expects it of him under the conditions which are present;\nand carries it out with a feebleness or a vivacity proportionate to\nhis histrionic gifts. But the odd thing is that persons unexposed to\nspiritualist traditions will so often act in the same way when they\nbecome entranced, speak in the name of the departed, go through the\nmotions of their several death-agonies, send messages about their happy\nhome in the summer-land, and describe the ailments of those present.\nI have no theory to publish of these cases, several of which I have\npersonally seen.\nAs an example of the automatic writing performances I will quote from\nan account of his own case kindly furnished me by Mr. Sidney Dean of\nWarren, R I., member of Congress from Connecticut from 1855 to 1859,\nwho has been all his life a robust and active journalist, author, and\nman of affairs. He has for many years been a writing subject, and has a\nlarge collection of manuscript automatically produced.\n\"Some of it,\" he writes us, \"is in hieroglyph, or strange compounded\narbitrary characters, each series possessing a seeming unity in\ngeneral design or character, followed by what purports to be a\ntranslation or rendering into mother English. I never attempted the\nseemingly impossible feat of copying the characters. They were cut\nwith the precision of a graver's tool, and generally with a single\nrapid stroke of the pencil. Many languages, some obsolete and passed\nfrom history, are professedly given. To see them would satisfy you\nthat no one could copy them except by tracing.\n\"These, however, are but a small part of the phenomena. The\n'automatic' has given place to the _impressional_, and when the work\nis in progress I am in the normal condition, and seemingly two minds,\nintelligences, persons, are practically engaged. The writing is in my\nown hand but the dictation not of my own mind and will, but that of\nanother, upon subjects of which I can have no knowledge and hardly a\ntheory; and I, myself, consciously criticise the thought, fact, mode\nof expressing it, etc., while the hand is recording the subject-matter\nand even the words impressed to be written. If _I_ refuse to write\nthe sentence, or even the word, the impression instantly ceases, and\nmy willingness must be mentally expressed before the work is resumed,\nand it is resumed at the point of cessation, even if it should be in\nthe middle of a sentence. Sentences are commenced without knowledge\nof mine as to their subject or ending. In fact, I have never known in\nadvance the subject of disquisition.\n\"There is in progress now, at uncertain times, not subject to my will,\na series of twenty-four chapters upon the scientific features of life,\nmoral, spiritual, eternal. Seven have already been written in the\nmanner indicated. These were preceded by twenty-four chapters relating\ngenerally to the life beyond material death, its characteristics,\netc. Each chapter is signed by the name of some person who has lived\non earth,--some with whom I have been personally acquainted, others\nknown in history.... I know nothing of the alleged authorship of any\nchapter until it is completed and the name impressed and appended....\nI am interested not only in the reputed authorship,--of which I have\nnothing corroborative,--but in the philosophy taught, of which I was\nin ignorance until these chapters appeared. From my standpoint of\nlife--which has been that of biblical orthodoxy--the philosophy is\nnew, seems to be reasonable, and is logically put. I confess to an\ninability to successfully controvert it to my own satisfaction.\n\"It is an intelligent _ego_ who writes, or else the influence\nassumes individuality, which practically makes of the influence a\npersonality. It is _not_ myself; of that I am conscious at every step\nof the process. I have also traversed the whole field of the claims\nof 'unconscious cerebration,' so called, so far as I am competent\nto critically examine it, and it fails, as a theory, in numberless\npoints, when applied to this strange work through me. It would be far\nmore reasonable and satisfactory for me to accept the silly hypothesis\nof re-incarnation,--the old doctrine of metempsychosis,--as taught\nby some spiritualists to-day, and to believe that I lived a former\nlife here, and that once in a while it dominates my intellectual\npowers, and writes chapters upon the philosophy of life, or opens a\npost-office for spirits to drop their effusions, and have them put\ninto English script. No; the easiest and most natural solution to me\nis to admit the claim made, i.e., that it is a decarnated intelligence\nwho writes. But _who?_ that is the question. The names of scholars\nand thinkers who once lived are affixed to the most ungrammatical and\nweakest of _bosh_....\n\"It seems reasonable to me--upon the hypothesis that it is a person\nusing another's mind or brain--that there must be more or less of\nthat other's style or tone incorporated in the message, and that to\nthe unseen personality, i.e., the power which impresses, the thought,\nthe fact, or the philosophy, and not the style or tone, belongs. For\ninstance, while the influence is impressing my brain with the greatest\nforce and rapidity, so that my pencil fairly flies over the paper to\nrecord the thoughts, I am conscious that, in many cases, the vehicle\nof the thought, i.e., the language, is very natural and familiar to\nme, as if, somehow, _my_ personality as a writer was getting mixed\nup with the message. And, again, the style, language, everything, is\nentirely foreign to my own style.\"\nI am myself persuaded by abundant acquaintance with the trances of\none medium that the 'control' may be altogether different from any\n_possible_ waking self of the person. In the case I have in mind,\nit professes to be a certain departed French doctor; and is, I am\nconvinced, acquainted with facts about the circumstances, and the\nliving and dead relatives and acquaintances, of numberless sitters\nwhom the medium never met before, and of whom she has never heard the\nnames. I record my bare opinion here unsupported by the evidence, not,\nof course, in order to convert anyone to my view, but because I am\npersuaded that a serious study of these trance-phenomena is one of the\ngreatest needs of psychology, and think that my personal confession\nmay possibly draw a reader or two into a field which the _soi-disant_\n'scientist' usually refuses to explore.\nMany persons have found evidence conclusive to their minds that in some\ncases the control is really the departed spirit whom it pretends to be.\nThe phenomena shade off so gradually into cases where this is obviously\nabsurd, that the presumption (quite apart from _a priori_ 'scientific'\nprejudice) is great against its being true. The case of Lurancy Vennum\nis perhaps as extreme a case of 'possession' of the modern sort as one\ncan find.[319] Lurancy was a young girl of fourteen, living with her\nparents at Watseka, Ill., who (after various distressing hysterical\ndisorders and spontaneous trances, during which she was possessed by\ndeparted spirits of a more or less grotesque sort) finally declared\nherself to be animated by the spirit of Mary Roff (a neighbor's\ndaughter, who had died in an insane asylum twelve years before) and\ninsisted on being sent 'home' to Mr. Roff's house. After a week of\n'homesickness' and importunity on her part, her parents agreed, and the\nRoffs, who pitied her, and who were spiritualists into the bargain,\ntook her in. Once there, she seems to have convinced the family that\ntheir dead Mary had exchanged habitations with Lurancy. Lurancy was\nsaid to be temporarily in heaven, and Mary's spirit now controlled her\norganism, and lived again in her former earthly home.\n\"The girl, now in her new home, seemed perfectly happy and content,\nknowing every person and everything that Mary knew when in her\noriginal body, twelve to twenty-five years ago, recognizing and\ncalling by name those who were friends and neighbors of the family\nfrom 1852 to 1865, when Mary died, calling attention to scores, yes,\nhundreds of incidents that transpired during her natural life. During\nall the period of her sojourn at Mr. Roff's she had no knowledge of,\nand did not recognize, any of Mr. Vennum's family, their friends or\nneighbors, yet Mr. and Mrs. Vennum and their children visited her and\nMr. Roff's people, she being introduced to them as to any strangers.\nAfter frequent visits, and hearing them often and favorably spoken\nof, she learned to love them as acquaintances, and visited them with\nMrs. Roff three times. From day to day she appeared natural, easy,\naffable, and industrious, attending diligently and faithfully to her\nhousehold duties, assisting in the general work of the family as a\nfaithful, prudent daughter might be supposed to do, singing, reading,\nor conversing as opportunity offered, upon all matters of private or\ngeneral interest to the family.\"\nThe so-called Mary whilst at the Roffs' would sometimes 'go back to\nheaven,' and leave the body in a 'quiet trance,' i.e., without the\noriginal personality of Lurancy returning. After eight or nine weeks,\nhowever, the memory and manner of Lurancy would sometimes partially,\nbut not entirely, return for a few minutes. Once Lurancy seems to\nhave taken full possession for a short time. At last, after some\nfourteen weeks, conformably to the prophecy which 'Mary' had made\nwhen she first assumed 'control,' she departed definitively and the\nLurancy-consciousness came back for good. Mr. Roff writes:\n\"She wanted me to take her home, which I did. She called me Mr. Roff,\nand talked with me as a young girl would, not being acquainted. I\nasked her how things appeared to her--if they seemed natural. She said\nit seemed like a dream to her. She met her parents and brothers in a\nvery affectionate manner, hugging and kissing each one in tears of\ngladness. She clasped her arms around her father's neck a long time,\nfairly smothering him with kisses. I saw her father just now (eleven\no'clock). He says she has been perfectly natural, and seems entirely\nwell.\"\nLurancy's mother writes, a couple of months later, that she was\n\"perfectly and entirely well and natural. For two or three weeks after\nher return home, she seemed a little strange to what she had been\nbefore she was taken sick last summer, but only, perhaps, the natural\nchange that had taken place with the girl, and except it seemed to\nher as though she had been dreaming or sleeping, etc. Lurancy has\nbeen smarter, more intelligent, more industrious, more womanly, and\nmore polite than before. We give the credit of her complete cure and\nrestoration to her family, to Dr. E. W. Stevens, and Mr. and Mrs.\nRoff, by their obtaining her removal to Mr. Roff's, where her cure was\nperfected. We firmly believe that, had she remained at home, she would\nhave died, or we would have been obliged to send her to the insane\nasylum; and if so, that she would have died there; and further, that\nI could not have lived but a short time with the care and trouble\ndevolving on me. Several of the relatives of Lurancy, including\nourselves, now believe she was cured by spirit power, and that Mary\nRoff controlled the girl.\"\nEight years later, Lurancy was reported to be married and a mother, and\nin good health. She had apparently outgrown the mediumistic phase of\nher existence.[320]\n*       *       *       *       *\nOn the condition of the sensibility during these invasions, few\nobservations have been made. I have found the hands of two automatic\nwriters an\u00e6sthetic during the act. In two others I have found this not\nto be the case. Automatic writing is usually preceded by shooting pains\nalong the arm-nerves and irregular contractions of the arm-muscles.\nI have found one medium's tongue and lips apparently insensible to\npin-pricks during her (speaking) trance.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIf we speculate on the brain-condition during all these different\nperversions of personality, we see that it must be supposed capable of\nsuccessively changing all its modes of action, and abandoning the use\nfor the time being of whole sets of well-organized association-paths.\nIn no other way can we explain the loss of memory in passing from one\nalternating condition to another. And not only this, but we must admit\nthat organized systems of paths can be thrown out of gear with others,\nso that the processes in one system give rise to one consciousness,\nand those of another system to another _simultaneously_ existing\nconsciousness. Thus only can we understand the facts of automatic\nwriting, etc., whilst the patient is out of trance, and the false\nan\u00e6sthesias and amnesias of the hysteric type. But just what sort of\ndissociation the phrase 'thrown out of gear' may stand for, we cannot\neven conjecture; only I think we ought not to talk of the doubling of\nthe self as if it consisted in the failure to combine on the part of\ncertain systems of _ideas_ which usually do so. It is better to talk\nof _objects_ usually combined, and which are now divided between the\ntwo 'selves,' in the hysteric and automatic cases in question. Each of\nthe selves is due to a system of cerebral paths acting by itself. If\nthe brain acted normally, and the dissociated systems came together\nagain, we should get a new affection of consciousness in the form of a\nthird 'Self' different from the other two, but knowing their objects\ntogether, as the result.--After all I have said in the last chapter,\nthis hardly needs further remark.\nSome peculiarities in the lower automatic performances suggest that\nthe systems thrown out of gear with each other are contained one in\nthe right and the other in the left hemisphere. The subjects, e.g.,\noften write backwards, or they transpose letters, or they write\nmirror-script. All these are symptoms of agraphic disease. The left\nhand, if left to its natural impulse, will in most people write\nmirror-script more easily than natural script. Mr. F. W. H. Myers has\nlaid stress on these analogies.[321] He has also called attention\nto the usual inferior moral tone of ordinary planchette writing. On\nHughlings Jackson's principles, the left hemisphere, being the more\nevolved organ, at ordinary times inhibits the activity of the right\none; but Mr. Myers suggests that during the automatic performances the\nusual inhibition may be removed and the right hemisphere set free to\nact all by itself. This is very likely to some extent to be the case.\nBut the crude explanation of 'two' selves by 'two' hemispheres is of\ncourse far from Mr. Myers's thought. The selves may be more than two,\nand the brain-systems severally used for each must be conceived as\ninterpenetrating each other in very minute ways.\nSUMMARY.\nTo sum up now this long chapter. The consciousness of Self involves\na stream of thought, each part of which as 'I' can 1) remember\nthose which went before, and know the things they knew; and 2)\nemphasize and care paramountly for certain ones among them as 'me,'\nand _appropriate to these_ the rest. The nucleus of the '_me_' is\nalways the bodily existence felt to be present at the time. Whatever\nremembered-past-feelings _resemble_ this present feeling are deemed to\nbelong to the same _me_ with it. Whatever other things are perceived to\nbe _associated_ with this feeling are deemed to form part of that me's\n_experience_; and of them certain ones (which fluctuate more or less)\nare reckoned to be themselves _constituents_ of the me in a larger\nsense,--such are the clothes, the material possessions, the friends,\nthe honors and esteem which the person receives or may receive. This me\nis an empirical aggregate of things objectively known. The _I_ which\nknows them cannot itself be an aggregate, neither for psychological\npurposes need it be considered to be an unchanging metaphysical entity\nlike the Soul, or a principle like the pure Ego, viewed as 'out of\ntime.' It is a _Thought_, at each moment different from that of the\nlast moment, but _appropriative_ of the latter, together with all that\nthe latter called its own. All the experiential facts find their place\nin this description, unencumbered with any hypothesis save that of the\nexistence of passing thoughts or states of mind. The same brain may\nsubserve many conscious selves, either alternate or coexisting; but by\nwhat modifications in its action, or whether ultra-cerebral conditions\nmay intervene, are questions which cannot now be answered.\nIf anyone urge that I assign no _reason_ why the successive passing\nthoughts should inherit each other's possessions, or why they and the\nbrain-states should be functions (in the mathematical sense) of each\nother, I reply that the reason, if there be any, must lie where all\nreal reasons lie, in the total sense or meaning of the world. If there\nbe such a meaning, or any approach to it (as we are bound to trust\nthere is), it alone can make clear to us why such finite human streams\nof thought are called into existence in such functional dependence\nupon brains. This is as much as to say that the special natural\nscience of _psychology_ must stop with the mere functional formula.\n_If the passing thought be the directly verifiable existent which no\nschool has hitherto doubted it to be, then that thought is itself the\nthinker_, and psychology need not look beyond. The only pathway that I\ncan discover for bringing in a more transcendental thinker would be to\n_deny_ that we have any _direct_ knowledge of the thought as such. The\nlatter's existence would then be reduced to a postulate, an assertion\nthat there _must be_ a _knower_ correlative to all this _known_; and\nthe problem _who that knower is_ would have become a metaphysical\nproblem. With the question once stated in these terms, the spiritualist\nand transcendentalist solutions must be considered as _prima facie_ on\na par with our own psychological one, and discussed impartially. But\nthat carries us beyond the psychological or naturalistic point of view.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[257] See, for a charming passage on the Philosophy of Dress, H.\nLotze's Microcosmus, Eng. tr. vol. i, p. 592 ff.\n[258] \"Who filches from me my good name,\" etc.\n[259] \"He who imagines commendation and disgrace not to be strong\nmotives on men ... seems little skilled in the nature and history of\nmankind; the greatest part whereof he shall find to govern themselves\nchiefly, if not solely, by this law of fashion; and so they do that\nwhich keeps them in reputation with their company, little regard\nthe laws of God or the magistrate. The penalties that attend the\nbreach of God's laws some, nay, most, men seldom seriously reflect\non; and amongst those that do, many, whilst they break the laws,\nentertain thoughts of future reconciliation, and making their peace\nfor such breaches: and as to the punishments due from the laws of the\ncommonwealth, they frequently flatter themselves with the hope of\nimpunity. But no man escapes the punishment of _their_ censure and\ndislike who offends against the fashion and opinion of the company he\nkeeps, and would recommend himself to. Nor is there one in ten thousand\nwho is stiff and insensible enough to bear up under the constant\ndislike and condemnation of his own club. He must be of a strange\nand unusual constitution who can content himself to live in constant\ndisgrace and disrepute with his own particular society. Solitude\nmany men have sought and been reconciled to; but nobody that has the\nleast thought or sense of a man about him can live in society under\nthe constant dislike and ill opinion of his familiars and those he\nconverses with. This is a burden too heavy for human sufferance: and he\nmust be made up of irreconcilable contradictions who can take pleasure\nin company and yet be insensible of contempt and disgrace from his\ncompanions.\" (Locke's Essay, book ii, ch. xxviii, \u00a7 12.)\n[260] For some farther remarks on these feelings of movement see the\nnext chapter.\n[261] Wundt's account of Self-consciousness deserves to be compared\nwith this. What I have called 'adjustments' he calls processes of\n'Apperception.' \"In this development (of consciousness) one particular\ngroup of percepts claims a prominent significance, namely, those\nof which the spring lies in ourselves. The images of feelings we\nget from our own body, and the representations of our own movements\ndistinguish themselves from all others by forming a _permanent_\ngroup. As there are always some muscles in a state either of tension\nor of activity it follows that we never lack a sense, either dim or\nclear, of the positions or movements of our body.... This permanent\nsense, moreover, has this peculiarity, that we are aware of our power\nat any moment voluntarily to arouse any one of its ingredients. We\nexcite the sensations of movement immediately by such impulses of\nthe will as shall arouse the movements themselves; and we excite the\nvisual and tactile feelings of our body by the voluntary movement of\nour organs of sense. So we come to conceive this permanent mass of\nfeeling as immediately or remotely subject to our will, and call it\nthe _consciousness of ourself_. This self-consciousness is, at the\noutset, thoroughly sensational,... only gradually the second-named\nof its characters, its subjection to our will, attains predominance.\nIn proportion as the apperception of all our mental objects appears\nto us as an inward exercise of will, does our self-consciousness\nbegin both to widen itself and to narrow itself at the same time. It\nwidens itself in that every mental act whatever comes to stand in\nrelation to our will; and it narrows itself in that it concentrates\nitself more and more upon the inner activity of apperception, over\nagainst which our own body and all the representations connected with\nit appear as external objects, different from our proper self. This\nconsciousness, contracted down to the process of apperception, we\ncall our Ego; and the apperception of mental objects in general, may\nthus, after Leibnitz, be designated as the raising of them into our\nself-consciousness. Thus the natural development of self-consciousness\nimplicitly involves the most abstract forms in which this faculty\nhas been described in philosophy; only philosophy is fond of placing\nthe abstract ego at the outset, and so reversing the process of\ndevelopment. Nor should we overlook the fact that the completely\nabstract ego [as pure activity], although suggested by the natural\ndevelopment of our consciousness, is never actually found therein.\nThe most speculative of philosophers is incapable of disjoining his\nego from those bodily feelings and images which form the incessant\nbackground of his awareness of himself. The notion of his ego as such\nis, like every notion, derived from sensibility, for the process of\napperception itself comes to our knowledge chiefly through those\nfeelings of tension [what I have above called inward adjustments] which\naccompany it.\" (Physiologische Psychologie, 2te Aufl. Bd. ii, pp.\n217-19.)\n[262] The only exception I know of is M. J. Souriau, in his important\narticle in the Revue Philosophique, vol. xxi, p. 449. M. Souriau's\nconclusion is 'que la conscience n'existe pas' (p. 472).\n[263] See the excellent remarks by Prof. Bain on the 'Emotion of Power'\nin his 'Emotions and the Will.'\n[264] Cf. Carlyle: _Sartor Resartus_, 'The Everlasting Yea.' \"I tell\nthee, blockhead, it all comes of thy vanity; of what thou fanciest\nthose same deserts of thine to be. Fancy that thou deservest to be\nhanged (as is most likely), thou wilt feel it happiness to be only\nshot: fancy that thou deservest to be hanged in a hair halter, it will\nbe a luxury to die in hemp.... What act of legislature was there that\n_thou_ shouldst be happy? A little while ago thou hadst no right to\n_be_ at all.\" etc., etc.\n[265] T. W. Higginson's translation (1866), p. 105.\n[266] \"The usual mode of lessening the shock of disappointment or\ndisesteem is to contract, if possible, a low estimate of the persons\nthat inflict it. This is our remedy for the unjust censures of party\nspirit, as well as of personal malignity.\" (Bain: Emotion and Will, p.\n209.)\n[267] It must be observed that the qualities of the Self thus ideally\nconstituted are all qualities approved by my actual fellows in the\nfirst instance; and that my reason for now appealing from their verdict\nto that of the ideal judge lies in some outward peculiarity of the\nimmediate case. What once was admired in me as courage has now become\nin the eyes of men 'impertinence'; what was fortitude is obstinacy;\nwhat was fidelity is now fanaticism. The ideal judge alone, I now\nbelieve, can read my qualities, my willingnesses, my powers, for what\nthey truly are. My fellows, misled by interest and prejudice, have gone\nastray.\n[268] The _kind_ of selfishness varies with the self that is sought.\nIf it be the mere bodily self; if a man grabs the best food, the warm\ncorner, the vacant seat; if he makes room for no one, spits about, and\nbelches in our faces,--we call it hoggishness. If it be the social\nself, in the form of popularity or influence, for which he is greedy,\nhe may in material ways subordinate himself to others as the best means\nto his end; and in this case he is very apt to pass for a disinterested\nman. If it be the 'other-worldly' self which he seeks, and if he seeks\nit ascetically,--even though he would rather see all mankind damned\neternally than lose his individual soul,--'saintliness' will probably\nbe the name by which his selfishness will be called.\n[269] Lotze, Med.

The whole section ought to be read.\n[271] Professor Bain, in his chapter on 'Emotions of Self,' does scant\njustice to the primitive nature of a large part of our self-feeling,\nand seems to reduce it to reflective self-estimation of this sober\nintellectual sort, which certainly _most_ of it is not. He says that\nwhen the attention is turned inward upon self as a Personality, \"we\nare putting forth towards ourselves the kind of exercise that properly\naccompanies our contemplation of other persons. We are accustomed to\nscrutinize the actions and conduct of those about us, to set a higher\n_value_ upon one man than upon another, by comparing the two; to _pity_\none in distress; to feel _complacency_ towards a particular individual;\nto _congratulate_ a man on some good fortune that it pleases us to see\nhim gain; to _admire_ greatness or excellence as displayed by any of\nour fellows. All these exercises are intrinsically social, like Love\nand Resentment; an isolated individual could never attain to them, nor\nexercise them. By what means, then, through what fiction [!] can we\nturn round and play them off upon self? Or how comes it that we obtain\nany satisfaction by putting self in the place of the other party?\nPerhaps the simplest form of the reflected act is that expressed by\nSelf-worth and Self-estimation, based and begun upon observation of\nthe ways and conduct of our fellow-beings. We soon make comparisons\namong the individuals about us; we see that one is stronger and does\nmore work than another, and, in consequence perhaps, receives more\npay. We see one putting forth perhaps more kindness than another, and\nin consequence receiving more love. We see some individuals surpassing\nthe rest in astonishing feats, and drawing after them the gaze and\nadmiration of a crowd. We acquire a series of fixed associations\ntowards persons so situated; favorable in the case of the superior, and\nunfavorable to the inferior. To the strong and laborious man we attach\nan estimate of greater reward, and feel that to be in his place would\nbe a happier lot than falls to others. Desiring, as we do, from the\nprimary motives of our being, to possess good things, and observing\nthese to come by a man's superior exertions, we feel a respect for\nsuch exertion and a wish that it might be ours. We know that we also\nput forth exertions for our share of good things; and on witnessing\nothers, we are apt to be reminded of ourselves and to make comparisons\nwith ourselves, which comparisons derive their interest from the\nsubstantial consequences. Having thus once learned to look at other\npersons as performing labors, greater or less, and as realizing fruits\nto accord; being, moreover, in all respects like our fellows,--we\nfind it an exercise neither difficult nor unmeaning to contemplate\nself as doing work and receiving the reward.... As we decide between\none man and another,--which is worthier,... so we decide between self\nand all other men; being, however, in this decision under the bias of\nour own desires.\" A couple of pages farther on we read: \"By the terms\nSelf-complacency. Self-gratulation, is indicated a positive enjoyment\nin dwelling upon our own merits and belongings. As in other modes, so\nhere, the starting point is the contemplation of excellence or pleasing\nqualities _in another person_, accompanied more or less with fondness\nor love.\" Self-pity is also regarded by Professor Bain, in this place,\nas an emotion diverted to ourselves from a more immediate object, \"in\na manner that we may term fictitious and unreal. Still, as we can view\nself in the light of another person, we can feel towards it the emotion\nof pity called forth by others in our situation.\"\nThis account of Professor Bain's is, it will be observed, a good\nspecimen of the old-fashioned mode of explaining the several emotions\nas rapid calculations of results, and the transfer of feeling from one\nobject to another, associated by contiguity or similarity with the\nfirst. Zoological evolutionism, which came up since Professor Bain\nfirst wrote, has made us see, on the contrary, that many emotions must\nbe _primitively_ aroused by special objects. None are more worthy\nof being ranked primitive than the self-gratulation and humiliation\nattendant on our own successes and failures in the main functions of\nlife. We need no borrowed reflection for these feelings. Professor\nBain's account applies to but that small fraction of our self-feeling\nwhich reflective criticism can add to, or subtract from, the total\nmass.--Lotze has some pages on the modifications of our self-regard by\nuniversal judgments, in Microcosmus, book v, chap. v, \u00a7 5.\n[272] \"Also nur dadurch, dass ich ein Mannigfaltiges gegehener\nVorstellungen in _einem Bewusstsein_ verbinden kann, ist es m\u00f6glich\ndass ich die _Identit\u00e4t des Bewusstseins_ in diesen _Vorstellungen_\nselbst vorstelle, d. h. die analytische Einheit der Apperception ist\nnur unter der Voraussetzung irgend einer synthetischen m\u00f6glich.\" In\nthis passage (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, 2te Aufl. \u00a7 16) Kant calls\nby the names of analytic and synthetic apperception what we here mean\nby objective and subjective synthesis respectively. It were much to\nbe desired that some one might invent a good pair of terms in which\nto record the distinction--those used in the text are certainly very\nbad, but Kant's seem to me still worse. 'Categorical unity' and\n'transcendental synthesis' would also be good Kantian, but hardly good\nhuman, speech.\n[273] So that we might say, by a sort of bad pun, \"only a connected\nworld can be known as disconnected.\" I say bad pun, because the point\nof view shifts between the connectedness and the disconnectedness. The\ndisconnectedness is of the realities known; the connectedness is of\nthe knowledge of them; and reality and knowledge of it are, from the\npsychological point of view held fast to in these pages, two different\nfacts.\n[274] Some subtle reader will object that the Thought cannot call any\npart of its Object 'I' and knit other parts on to it, without first\nknitting that part on to _Itself_; and that it cannot knit it on to\nItself without knowing Itself;--so that our supposition (above, p.\n304) that the Thought may conceivably have no immediate knowledge of\nItself is thus overthrown. To which the reply is that we must take\ncare not to be duped by words. The words _I_ and _me_ signify nothing\nmysterious and unexampled--they are at bottom only names of _emphasis_;\nand Thought is always emphasizing something. Within a tract of space\nwhich it cognizes, it contrasts a _here_ with a _there_; within a\ntract of time a _now_ with a _then_; of a pair of things it calls one\n_this_, the other _that_. I and _thou_, I and _it_, are distinctions\nexactly on a par with these,--distinctions possible in an exclusively\n_objective_ field of knowledge, the 'I' meaning for the Thought nothing\nbut the bodily life which it momentarily feels. The sense of my bodily\nexistence, however obscurely recognized as such, _may_ then be the\nabsolute original of my conscious selfhood, the fundamental perception\nthat _I am_. All appropriations _may_ be made _to_ it, _by_ a Thought\nnot at the moment immediately cognized by itself. Whether these are\nnot only logical possibilities but actual facts is something not yet\ndogmatically decided in the text.\n[275] Metaphysik, \u00a7 245 _fin_. This writer, who in his early work, the\nMedizinische Psychologie, was (to my reading) a strong defender of the\nSoul-Substance theory, has written in \u00a7\u00a7 243-5 of his Metaphysik the\nmost beautiful criticism of this theory which exists.\n[276] On the empirical and transcendental conceptions of the self's\nunity, see Lotze, Metaphysic, \u00a7 244.\n[277] Appendix to book i of Hume's Treatise on Human Nature.\n[278] Herbart believed in the Soul, too; but for him the 'Self' of\nwhich we are 'conscious' is the empirical Self--not the soul.\n[279] Compare again the remarks on pp. 158-162 above.\n[280] System of Psychology (1884). vol. i, p. 114.\n[281] 'Distinct only to _observation_,' he adds.

The 'as it\nwere' is delightfully characteristic of the school.\n[283] J. Mill's Analysis, vol. ii, p. 175.\n[284] Examination of Hamilton. 4th ed. p. 263.\n[285] His chapter on the Psychological Theory of Mind is a beautiful\ncase in point, and his concessions there have become so celebrated\nthat they must be quoted for the reader's benefit. He ends the chapter\nwith these words (_loc. cit._ p. 247): \"The theory, therefore,\nwhich resolves Mind into a series of feelings, with a background of\npossibilities of feeling, can effectually withstand the most invidious\nof the arguments directed against it. But groundless as are the\nextrinsic objections, the theory has intrinsic difficulties which\nwe have not set forth, and which it seems to me beyond the power of\nmetaphysical analysis to remove....\n\"The thread of consciousness which composes the mind's phenomenal\nlife consist not only of present sensations, but likewise, in part,\nof memories and expectations. Now what are these? In themselves,\nthey are present feelings, states of present consciousness, and in\nthat respect not distinguished from sensations. They all, moreover,\nresemble some given sensations or feelings, of which we have previously\nhad experience. But they are attended with the peculiarity that each\nof them involves a belief in more than its own present existence. A\nsensation involves only this; but a remembrance of sensation, even if\nnot referred to any particular date, involves the suggestion and belief\nthat a sensation, of which it is a copy or representation, actually\nexisted in the past; and an expectation involves the belief, more or\nless positive, that a sensation or other feeling to which it directly\nrefers will exist in the future. Nor can the phenomena involved in\nthese two states of consciousness be adequately expressed, without\nsaying that the belief they include is, that I myself formerly had,\nor that I myself, and no other, shall hereafter have, the sensations\nremembered or expected. The fact believed is, that the sensations did\nactually form, or will hereafter form, part of the self-same series\nof states, or thread of consciousness, of which the remembrance or\nexpectation of those sensations is the part now present. If, therefore,\nwe speak of the mind as a series of feelings we are obliged to complete\nthe statement by calling it a series of feelings which is aware of\nitself as past and future; and we are reduced to the alternative of\nbelieving that the mind, or Ego, is something different from any series\nof feelings, or possibilities of them, or of accepting the paradox that\nsomething which _ex hypothesi_ is but a series of feelings, can be\naware of itself as a series.\n\"The truth is, that we are here face to face with that final\ninexplicability, at which, as Sir W. Hamilton observes, we inevitably\narrive when we reach ultimate facts; and in general, one mode of\nstating it only appears more incomprehensible than another, because\nthe whole of human language is accommodated to the one, and is so\nincongruous with the other that it cannot be expressed in any terms\nwhich do not deny its truth. The real stumbling-block is perhaps\nnot in any theory of the fact, but in the fact itself. The true\nincomprehensibility perhaps is, that something which has ceased, or is\nnot yet in existence, can still be, in a manner, present; that a series\nof feelings, the infinitely greater part of which is past or future,\ncan be gathered up, as it were, into a simple present conception,\naccompanied by a belief of reality. I think by far the wisest thing we\ncan do is to accept the inexplicable fact, without any theory of how\nit takes place; and when we are obliged to speak of it in terms which\nassume a theory, to use them with a reservation as to their meaning.\"\nIn a later place in the same book (p. 561) Mill, speaking of what may\nrightly be demanded of a theorist, says: \"He is not entitled to frame\na theory from one class of phenomena, extend it to another class which\nit does not fit, and excuse himself by saying that if we cannot make\nit fit, it is because ultimate facts are inexplicable.\" The class of\nphenomena which the associationist school takes to frame its theory\nof the Ego are feelings unaware of each other. The class of phenomena\nthe Ego presents are feelings of which the later ones are intensely\naware of those that went before. The two classes do not 'fit,' and no\nexercise of ingenuity can ever make them fit. No _shuffling_ of unaware\nfeelings can make them aware. To get the awareness we must openly beg\nit by postulating a new feeling which has it. This new feeling is no\n'Theory' of the phenomena, but a simple statement of them; and as\nsuch I postulate in the text the present passing Thought as a psychic\ninteger, with its knowledge of so much that has gone before.\n[286] Kritik d. reinen Vernunft, 2te Aufl. \u00a7 17.\n[287] It must be noticed, in justice to what was said above on page 274\nff., that neither Kant nor his successors anywhere discriminate between\nthe _presence_ of the apperceiving Ego to the combined object, and the\n_awareness by_ that Ego _of_ its own presence and of its distinctness\nfrom what it apperceives. That the Object must be known to something\nwhich _thinks_, and that it must be known to something which _thinks\nthat it thinks_, are treated by them as identical necessities,--by what\nlogic, does not appear. Kant tries to soften the jump in the reasoning\nby saying the thought _of itself_ on the part of the Ego need only\nbe _potential_--\"the 'I think' must _be capable_ of accompanying all\nother knowledge\"--but a thought which is only potential is actually no\nthought at all, which practically gives up the case.\n[288] \"As regards the soul, now, or the 'I,' the 'thinker,' the whole\ndrift of Kant's advance upon Hume and sensational psychology is towards\nthe demonstration that the subject of knowledge is an _Agent_.\" (G. S.\nMorris, Kant's Critique, etc. (Chicago, 1882), p. 224.)\n[289] \"In Kant's Prolegomena,\" says H. Cohen,--I do not myself find\nthe passage,--\"it is expressly said that the problem is not to show\nhow experience arises (ensteht), but of what it consists (besteht).\"\n(Kant's Theorie d. Erfahrung (1871), p. 138.)\n[290] The contrast between the Monism thus reached and our own\npsychological point of view can be exhibited schematically thus,\nthe terms in squares standing for what, for us, are the ultimate\nirreducible data of psychological science, and the vincula above it\nsymbolizing the reductions which post-Kantian idealism performs:\nAbsolute Self-consciousness\nReason or\nExperience.\n/           \\\nTranscendental Ego          World\n/       \\                 /        \\\nPsychologist   Thought     Thought's Object  Psychologist's Reality\n\\    \\                  /     /\nPsychologist's Object.\nThese reductions account for the ubiquitousness of the 'psychologist's\nfallacy (bk. ii, ch. i, p. 32) in the modern monistic writings. For\n_us_ it is an unpardonable logical sin, when talking of a thought's\nknowledge (either of an object or of itself), to change the terms\nwithout warning, and, substituting the psychologist's knowledge\ntherefor, still make as if we were continuing to talk of the same\nthing. For monistic idealism, this is the very enfranchisement of\nphilosophy, and of course cannot be too much indulged in.\n[291] T. H. Green, Prolegomena to Ethics, \u00a7\u00a7 57, 61, 64.\n[292] _Loc. cit._ \u00a7 64.\n[293] E. Caird: Hegel (1883), p. 149.\n[294] One is almost tempted to believe that the pantomime-state of mind\nand that of the Hegelian dialectics are, emotionally considered, one\nand the same thing. In the pantomime all common things are represented\nto happen in impossible ways, people jump down each other's throats,\nhouses turn inside out, old women become young men, everything 'passes\ninto its opposite' with inconceivable celerity and skill; and this, so\nfar from producing perplexity, brings rapture to the beholder's mind.\nAnd so in the Hegelian logic, relations elsewhere recognized under\nthe insipid name of distinctions (such as that between knower and\nobject, many and one) must first be translated into impossibilities and\ncontradictions, then 'transcended' and identified by miracle, ere the\nproper temper is induced for thoroughly enjoying the spectacle they\nshow.\n[295] The reader will please understand that I am quite willing to\nleave the hypothesis of the transcendental Ego as a substitute for the\npassing Thought open to discussion on _general speculative grounds_.\nOnly _in this book_ I prefer to stick by the common sense assumption\nthat we have successive conscious states, because all psychologists\nmake it, and because one does not see how there can be a Psychology\nwritten which does not postulate such thoughts as its ultimate data.\nThe data of all natural sciences become in turn subjects of a critical\ntreatment more refined than that which the sciences themselves\naccord; and so it may fare in the end with our passing Thought. We\nhave ourselves seen (pp. 299-305) that the _sensible_ certainty of\nits existence is less strong than is usually assumed. My quarrel with\nthe transcendental Egoists is mainly about their _grounds_ for their\nbelief. Did they consistently propose it as a _substitute_ for the\npassing Thought, did they consistently _deny the latter's existence_,\nI should respect their position more. But so far as I can understand\nthem, they habitually believe in the passing Thought also. They seem\neven to believe in the Lockian stream of separate ideas, for the chief\nglory of the Ego in their pages is always its power to 'overcome'\nthis separateness and unite the naturally disunited, _'synthetizing,'\n'connecting,' or 'relating' the ideas together_ being used as synonyms,\nby transcendentalist writers, for _knowing various objects at once_.\nNot the being conscious at all, but the being conscious of _many things\ntogether_ is held to be the difficult thing, in our psychic life, which\nonly the wonder-working Ego can perform. But on what slippery ground\ndoes one get the moment one changes the definite notion of _knowing an\nobject_ into the altogether vague one of _uniting or synthetizing the\nideas_ of its various parts!--In the chapter on Sensation we shall come\nupon all this again.\n[296] \"When we compare the listless inactivity of the infant,\nslumbering from the moment at which he takes his milky food to the\nmoment at which he wakes to require it again, with the restless\nenergies of that mighty being which he is to become in his maturer\nyears, pouring truth after truth, in rapid and dazzling profusion, upon\nthe world, or grasping in his single hand the destiny of empires, how\nfew are the circumstances of resemblance which we can trace, of all\nthat intelligence which is afterwards to be displayed; how little more\nis seen than what serves to give feeble motion to the mere machinery\nof life!... Every age, if we may speak of many ages in the few years\nof human life, seems to be marked with a distinct character. Each has\nits peculiar objects which excite lively affections; and in each,\nexertion is excited by affections, which in other periods terminate\nwithout inducing active desire. The boy finds a world in less space\nthan that which bounds his visible horizon; he wanders over his range\nof field and exhausts his strength in the pursuit of objects which,\nin the years that follow, are seen only to be neglected; while to\nhim the objects that are afterwards to absorb his whole soul are\nas indifferent as the objects of his present passions are destined\nthen to appear.... How many opportunities must every one have had of\nwitnessing the progress of intellectual decay, and the coldness that\nsteals upon the once benevolent heart! We quit our country, perhaps at\nan early period of life, and after an absence of many years we return\nwith all the remembrances of past pleasure which grow more tender as\nthey approach their objects. We eagerly seek him to whose paternal\nvoice we have been accustomed to listen with the same reverence as\nif its predictions had possessed oracular certainty,--who first led\nus into knowledge, and whose image has been constantly joined in our\nmind with all that veneration which does not forbid love. We find him\nsunk, perhaps, in the imbecility of idiotism, unable to recognize\nus,--ignorant alike of the past and of the future, and living only in\nthe sensibility of animal gratification. We seek the favorite companion\nof our childhood, whose tenderness of heart, etc.... We find him\nhardened into a man, meeting us scarcely with the cold hypocrisy of\ndissembled friendship--in his general relations to the world careless\nof the misery _he_ is not to feel.... When we observe all this,... do\nwe use only a metaphor of little meaning when we say of him that he is\nbecome a different person, and that his mind and character are changed?\nIn what does the identity consist?... The supposed test of identity,\nwhen applied to the mind in these cases, completely fails. It neither\naffects, nor is affected, in the same manner in the same circumstances.\nIt therefore, if the test be a just one, is not the same identical\nmind.\" (T. Brown: Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind, 'on\nMental Identity.')\n[297] \"Sir John Cutler had a pair of black worsted stockings, which\nhis maid darned so often with silk that they became at last a pair of\nsilk stockings. Now, supposing these stockings of Sir John's endued\nwith some degree of consciousness at every particular darning, they\nwould have been sensible that they were the same individual pair of\nstockings both before and after the darning; and this sensation would\nhave continued in them through all the succession of darnings; and yet\nafter the last of all, there was not perhaps one thread left of the\nfirst pair of stockings: but they were grown to be silk stockings, as\nwas said before.\" (Pope's Martinus Scriblerus, quoted by Brown, _ibid._)\n[298] Hours of Work and Play, p. 100.\n[299] For a careful study of the errors in narratives, see E.

Med., xxii, 847, 1878). This boy, whom we shall later find\ninstructive in many connections, was totally an\u00e6sthetic without and (so\nfar as could be tested) within, save for the sight of one eye and the\nhearing of one ear. When his eye was closed, he said: \"_Wenn ich nicht\nsehen kann, da_ BIN _ich gar nicht_--I no longer _am_.\"\n[302] \"One can compare the state of the patient to nothing so well as\nto that of a caterpillar, which, keeping all its caterpillar's ideas\nand remembrances, should suddenly become a butterfly with a butterfly's\nsenses and sensations. Between the old and the new state, between the\nfirst self, that of the caterpillar, and the second self, that of\nthe butterfly, there is a deep scission, a complete rupture. The new\nfeelings find no anterior series to which they can knit themselves on;\nthe patient can neither interpret nor use them; he does not recognize\nthem; they are unknown. Hence two conclusions, the first which\nconsists in his saying, _I no longer am_; the second, somewhat later,\nwhich consists in his saying, _I am another person._\" (H.

When a poor man draws the big prize\nin a lottery, or unexpectedly inherits an estate; when a man high in\nfame is publicly disgraced, a millionaire becomes a pauper, or a loving\nhusband and father sees his family perish at one fell swoop, there\nis temporarily such a rupture between all past habits, whether of an\nactive or a passive kind, and the exigencies and possibilities of the\nnew situation, that the individual may find no medium of continuity or\nassociation to carry him over from the one phase to the other of his\nlife. Under these conditions mental derangement is no unfrequent result.\n[307] The number of subjects who can do this with any fertility and\nexuberance is relatively quite small.\n[308] First in the Revue Scientifique for May 26, 1876, then in his\nbook, Hypnotisme, Double Conscience, et Alt\u00e9rations de la Personnalit\u00e9\n(Paris, 1887).\n[309] Der Hypnotismus (1884), pp. 109-15.\n[310] Transactions of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, April\n4, 1888.

(_Loc.\ncit._ p. 619.)--It does not appear that there was any important\ndifference in the sensibility of F\u00e9lida X. between her two states--as\nfar as one can judge from M.

The Germans have explicitly treated of it,\neither as a faculty or as a resultant, but in the pages of such writers\nas Locke, Hume, Hartley, the Mills, and Spencer the word hardly occurs,\nor if it does so, it is parenthetically and as if by inadvertence.[322]\nThe motive of this ignoring of the phenomenon of attention is obvious\nenough. These writers are bent on showing how the higher faculties of\nthe mind are pure products of 'experience;' and experience is supposed\nto be of something simply _given_. Attention, implying a degree of\nreactive spontaneity, would seem to break through the circle of pure\nreceptivity which constitutes 'experience,' and hence must not be\nspoken of under penalty of interfering with the smoothness of the tale.\nBut the moment one thinks of the matter, one sees how false a notion\nof experience that is which would make it tantamount to the mere\npresence to the senses of an outward order. Millions of items of the\noutward order are present to my senses which never properly enter\ninto my experience. Why? Because they have no _interest_ for me. _My\nexperience is what I agree to attend to._ Only those items which I\n_notice_ shape my mind--without selective interest, experience is\nan utter chaos. Interest alone gives accent and emphasis, light and\nshade, background and foreground--intelligible perspective, in a word.\nIt varies in every creature, but without it the consciousness of\nevery creature would be a gray chaotic indiscriminateness, impossible\nfor us even to conceive. Such an empiricist writer as Mr. Spencer,\nfor example, regards the creature as absolutely passive clay, upon\nwhich 'experience' rains down. The clay will be impressed most deeply\nwhere the drops fall thickest, and so the final shape of the mind\nis moulded. Give time enough, and all sentient things ought, at\nthis rate, to end by assuming an identical mental constitution--for\n'experience,' the sole shaper, is a constant fact, and the order of\nits items must end by being exactly reflected by the passive mirror\nwhich we call the sentient organism. If such an account were true, a\nrace of dogs bred for generations, say in the Vatican, with characters\nof visual shape, sculptured in marble, presented to their eyes, in\nevery variety of form and combination, ought to discriminate before\nlong the finest shades of these peculiar characters. In a word, they\nought to become, if time were given, accomplished _connoisseurs_ of\nsculpture. Anyone may judge of the probability of this consummation.\nSurely an eternity of experience of the statues would leave the dog as\ninartistic as he was at first, for the lack of an original interest to\nknit his discriminations on to. Meanwhile the odors at the bases of\nthe pedestals would have organized themselves in the consciousness of\nthis breed of dogs into a system of 'correspondences' to which the most\nhereditary caste of _custodi_ would never approximate, merely because\nto them, as human beings, the dog's interest in those smells would\nfor ever be an inscrutable mystery. These writers have, then, utterly\nignored the glaring fact that subjective interest may, by laying its\nweighty index-finger on particular items of experience, so accent them\nas to give to the least frequent associations far more power to shape\nour thought than the most frequent ones possess. The interest itself,\nthough its genesis is doubtless perfectly _natural, makes_ experience\nmore than it is made by it.\n*       *       *       *       *\nEvery one knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by\nthe mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several\nsimultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization,\nconcentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies\nwithdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others,\nand is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed,\nscatter-brained state which in French is called _distraction_, and\n_Zerstreutheit_ in German.\nWe all know this latter state, even in its extreme degree. Most people\nprobably fall several times a day into a fit of something like this:\nThe eyes are fixed on vacancy, the sounds of the world melt into\nconfused unity, the attention is dispersed so that the whole body is\nfelt, as it were, at once, and the foreground of consciousness is\nfilled, if by anything, by a sort of solemn sense of surrender to\nthe empty passing of time. In the dim background of our mind we know\nmeanwhile what we ought to be doing: getting up, dressing ourselves,\nanswering the person who has spoken to us, trying to make the next\nstep in our reasoning. But somehow we cannot _start_; the _pens\u00e9e de\nderri\u00e8re la t\u00eate_ fails to pierce the shell of lethargy that wraps our\nstate about. Every moment we expect the spell to break, for we know\nno reason why it should continue. But it does continue, pulse after\npulse, and we float with it, until--also without reason that we can\ndiscover--an energy is given, something--we know not what--enables us\nto gather ourselves together, we wink our eyes, we shake our heads,\nthe background-ideas become effective, and the wheels of life go round\nagain.\nThis curious state of inhibition can for a few moments be produced at\nwill by fixing the eyes on vacancy. Some persons can voluntarily empty\ntheir minds and 'think of nothing.' With many, as Professor Exner\nremarks of himself, this is the most efficacious means of falling\nasleep. It is difficult not to suppose something like this scattered\ncondition of mind to be the usual state of brutes when not actively\nengaged in some pursuit. Fatigue, monotonous mechanical occupations\nthat end by being automatically carried on, tend to produce it in men.\nIt is not sleep; and yet when aroused from such a state, a person\nwill often hardly be able to say what he has been thinking about\nSubjects of the hypnotic trance seem to lapse into it when left to\nthemselves; asked what they are thinking of, they reply, 'of nothing\nparticular'![323]\nThe abolition of this condition is what we call the awakening of\nthe attention. One principal object comes then into the focus of\nconsciousness, others are temporarily suppressed. The awakening\nmay come about either by reason of a stimulus from without, or in\nconsequence of some unknown inner alteration; and the change it\nbrings with it amounts to a concentration upon one single object with\nexclusion of aught besides, or to a condition anywhere between this and\nthe completely dispersed state.\nTO HOW MANY THINGS CAN WE ATTEND AT ONCE?\nThe question of _the 'span' of consciousness_ has often been asked and\nanswered--sometimes _a priori_, sometimes by experiment. This seems the\nproper place for us to touch upon it; and our answer, according to the\nprinciples laid down in Chapter IX, will not be difficult. The number\nof _things_ we may attend to is altogether indefinite, depending on the\npower of the individual intellect, on the form of the apprehension, and\non what the things are. When apprehended conceptually as a connected\nsystem, their number may be very large. But however numerous the\nthings, they can only be known in a single pulse of consciousness for\nwhich they form one complex 'object' (p. 276 ff.), so that properly\nspeaking there is before the mind at no time a plurality of _ideas_,\nproperly so called.\nThe 'unity of the soul' has been supposed by many philosophers, who\nalso believed in the distinct atomic nature of 'ideas,' to preclude the\npresence to it of more than one objective fact, manifested in one idea,\nat a time. Even Dugald Stuart opines that every _minimum visibile_ of a\npictured figure\n\"constitutes just as distinct an object of attention to the mind as if\nit were separated by an interval of empty space from the rest.... It\nis impossible for the mind to attend to more than one of these points\nat once; and as the perception of the figure implies a knowledge of\nthe relative situation of the different points with respect to each\nother, we must conclude that the perception of figure by the eye is\nthe result of a number of different acts of attention. These acts\nof attention, however, are performed with such rapidity, that the\neffect, with respect to us, is the same as if the perception were\ninstantaneous.\"[324]\nSuch glaringly artificial views can only come from fantastic\nmetaphysics or from the ambiguity of the word 'idea,' which, standing\nsometimes for mental state and sometimes for thing known, leads men to\nascribe to the thing, not only the unity which belongs to the mental\nstate, but even the simplicity which is thought to reside in the Soul.\nWhen the things are apprehended by the _senses_, the number of them\nthat can be attended to at once is small, \"_Pluribus intentus, minor\nest ad singula sensus_.\"\n\"By Charles Bonnet the Mind is allowed to have a distinct notion\nof six objects at once; by Abraham Tucker the number is limited to\nfour; while Destutt Tracy again amplifies it to six. The opinion\nof the first and last of these philosophers\" [continues Sir Wm.\nHamilton] \"seems to me correct. You can easily make the experiments\nfor yourselves, but you must beware of grouping the objects into\nclasses. If you throw a handful of marbles on the floor, you will find\nit difficult to view at once more than six, or seven at most, without\nconfusion; but if you group them into twos, or threes, or fives, you\ncan comprehend as many groups as you can units; because the mind\nconsiders these groups only as units--it views them as wholes, and\nthrows their parts out of consideration.\"[325]\nProfessor Jevons, repeating this observation, by counting\ninstantaneously beans thrown into a box, found that the number 6\nwas guessed correctly 120 times out of 147, 5 correctly 102 times\nout of 107, and 4 and 3 always right.[326] It is obvious that such\nobservations decide nothing at all about our attention, properly\nso called. They rather measure in part the distinctness of our\nvision--especially of the primary-memory-image[327]--in part the amount\nof association in the individual between seen arrangements and the\nnames of numbers.[328]\nEach number-name is a way of grasping the beans as one total object.\nIn such a total object, all the parts converge harmoniously to the one\nresultant concept; no single bean has special discrepant associations\nof its own; and so, with _practice_, they may grow quite numerous ere\nwe fail to estimate them aright. But where the 'object' before us\nbreaks into parts disconnected with each other, and forming each as it\nwere a separate object or system, not conceivable in union with the\nrest, it becomes harder to apprehend all these parts at once, and the\nmind tends to let go of one whilst it attends to another. Still, within\nlimits this can be done. M. Paulhan has experimented carefully on the\nmatter by declaiming one poem aloud whilst he repeated a different one\nmentally, or by writing one sentence whilst speaking another, or by\nperforming calculations on paper whilst reciting poetry.[329] He found\nthat\n\"the most favorable condition for the doubling of the mind was its\nsimultaneous application to two easy and heterogeneous operations. Two\noperations of the same sort, two multiplications, two recitations, or\nthe reciting one poem and writing another, render the process more\nuncertain and difficult.\"\nThe attention often, but not always, oscillates during these\nperformances; and sometimes a word from one part of the task slips\ninto another. I myself find when I try to simultaneously recite one\nthing and write another that the beginning of each word or segment of\na phrase is what requires the attention. Once started, my pen runs on\nfor a word or two as if by its own momentum. M. Paulhan compared the\ntime occupied by the same two operations done simultaneously or in\nsuccession, and found that there was often a considerable gain of time\nfrom doing them simultaneously. For instance:\n\"I write the first four verses of Athalie, whilst reciting eleven of\nMusset. The whole performance occupies 40 seconds. But reciting alone\ntakes 22 and writing alone 31, or 53 altogether, so that there is a\ndifference in favor of the simultaneous operations.\"\nOr again:\n\"I multiply 421 312 212 by 2; the operation takes 6 seconds; the\nrecitation of 4 verses also takes 6 seconds. But the two operations\ndone at once only take 6 seconds, so that there is no loss of time\nfrom combining them.\"\nOf course these time-measurements lack precision. With three systems of\nobject (writing with _each_ hand whilst reciting) the operation became\nmuch more difficult.\nIf, then, by the original question, how many ideas or things can we\nattend to at once, be meant how many entirely disconnected systems or\nprocesses of conception can go on simultaneously, the answer is, _not\neasily more than one, unless the processes are very habitual; but then\ntwo, or even three,_ without very much oscillation of the attention.\nWhere, however, the processes are less automatic, as in the story of\nJulius C\u00e6sar dictating four letters whilst he writes a fifth,[330]\nthere must be a rapid oscillation of the mind from one to the next, and\nno consequent gain of time. Within any one of the systems the parts may\nbe numberless, but we attend to them collectively when we conceive the\nwhole which they form.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhen the things to be attended to are small sensations, and when the\neffort is to be exact in noting them, it is found that attention to one\ninterferes a good deal with the perception of the other. A good deal\nof fine work has been done in this field, of which I must give some\naccount.\nIt has long been noticed, when expectant attention is concentrated\nupon one of two sensations, that the other one is apt to be displaced\nfrom consciousness for a moment and to appear subsequent; although in\nreality the two may have been contemporaneous events. Thus, to use\nthe stock example of the books, the surgeon would sometimes see the\nblood flow from the arm of the patient whom he was bleeding, _before_\nhe saw the instrument penetrate the skin. Similarly the smith may see\nthe sparks fly _before_ he sees the hammer smite the iron, etc. There\nis thus a certain difficulty in perceiving the exact _date_ of two\nimpressions when they do not interest our attention equally, and when\nthey are of a disparate sort.\nProfessor Exner, whose experiments on the _minimal perceptible\nsuccession_ in time of two sensations we shall have to quote in another\nchapter, makes some noteworthy remarks about the way in which the\nattention must be _set_ to catch the interval and the right order of\nthe sensations, when the time is exceeding small. The point was to\ntell whether two signals were simultaneous or successive; and, if\nsuccessive, which one of them came first.\nThe first way of attending which he found himself to fall into, was\nwhen the signals did not differ greatly--when, e.g., they were similar\nsounds heard each by a different ear. Here he lay in wait for the\n_first_ signal, whichever it might be, and identified it the next\nmoment in memory. The second, which could then always be known by\ndefault, was often not clearly distinguished in itself. When the time\nwas too short, the first could not be isolated from the second at all.\nThe second way was to accommodate the attention for a certain _sort_\nof signal, and the next moment to become aware in memory of whether it\ncame before or after its mate.\n\"This way brings great uncertainty with it. The impression not\nprepared for comes to us in the memory more weak than the other,\nobscure as it were, badly fixed in time. We tend to take the\nsubjectively stronger stimulus, that which we were intent upon, for\nthe first, just as we are apt to take an objectively stronger stimulus\nto be the first. Still, it may happen otherwise. In the experiments\nfrom touch to sight it often seemed to me as if the impression for\nwhich the attention was _not_ prepared were there already when the\nother came.\"\nExner found himself employing this method oftenest when the impressions\ndiffered strongly.[331]\nIn such observations (which must not be confounded with those where\nthe two signals were identical and their successiveness known as\nmere _doubleness_, without distinction of which came first), it is\nobvious that each signal must combine stably in our perception with a\n_different_ instant of time. It is the simplest possible case of two\ndiscrepant concepts simultaneously occupying the mind. Now the case of\nthe signals being _simultaneous_ seems of a different sort. We must\nturn to Wundt for observations fit to cast a nearer light thereon.\nThe reader will remember the reaction-time experiments of which we\ntreated in Chapter III. It happened occasionally in Wundt's experiments\nthat the reaction-time was reduced to zero or even assumed a negative\nvalue, which, being translated into common speech, means that the\nobserver was sometimes so intent upon the signal that his reaction\n_actually coincided in time with it, or even preceded it,_ instead of\ncoming a fraction of a second after it, as in the nature of things it\nshould. More will be said of these results anon. Meanwhile Wundt, in\nexplaining them, says this:\n\"In general _we have a very exact feeling of the simultaneity of two\nstimuli,_ if they do not differ much in strength. And in a series of\nexperiments in which a warning precedes, at a fixed interval, the\nstimulus, we involuntarily try to react, not only as promptly as\npossible, but also in such wise that our movement may coincide with\nthe stimulus itself. We seek to make our own feelings of touch and\ninnervation [muscular contraction] objectively _contemporaneous with\nthe signal_ which we hear; and experience shows that in many cases we\napproximately succeed. In these cases we have a distinct consciousness\nof hearing the signal, reacting upon it, and feeling our reaction take\nplace,--all at one and the same moment.\"[332]\nIn another place, Wundt adds:\n\"The difficulty of these observations and the comparative infrequency\nwith which the reaction-time can be made thus to disappear shows how\nhard it is, when our attention is intense, to keep it fixed even on\n_two_ different ideas at once. Note besides that when this happens,\none always tries to bring the ideas into a certain connection, to\ngrasp them as components of a certain complex representation. Thus in\nthe experiments in question, it has often seemed to me that I produced\nby my own recording movement the sound which the ball made in dropping\non the board.\"[333]\nThe 'difficulty,' in the cases of which Wundt speaks, is that of\nforcing two non-simultaneous events into apparent combination with\nthe same instant of time. There is no difficulty, as he admits, in so\ndividing our attention between two _really_ simultaneous impressions\nas to feel them to be such. The cases he describes are really cases\nof anachronistic perception, of subjective time-displacement, to use\nhis own term. Still more curious cases of it have been most carefully\nstudied by him. They carry us a step farther in our research, so I will\nquote them, using as far as possible his exact words:\n\"The conditions become more complicated when we receive a series\nof impressions separated by distinct intervals, into the midst of\nwhich a heterogeneous impression is suddenly brought. Then comes\nthe question, with which member of the series do we perceive the\nadditional impression to coincide? with that member with whose\npresence it really coexists, or is there some aberration?... If the\nadditional stimulus belongs to a different sense very considerable\naberrations may occur.\n\"The best way to experiment is with a number of visual impressions\n(which one can easily get from a moving object) for the series, and\nwith a sound as the disparate impression. Let, e.g., an index-hand\nmove over a circular scale with uniform and sufficiently slow\nvelocity, so that the impressions it gives will not fuse, but permit\nits position at any instant to be distinctly seen. Let the clockwork\nwhich turns it have an arrangement which rings a bell once in every\nrevolution, but at a point which can be varied, so that the observer\nneed never know in advance just when the bell-stroke takes place.\nIn such observations three cases are possible. The bell-stroke can\nbe perceived either exactly at the moment to which the index points\nwhen it sounds--in this case there will be no time-displacement; or\nwe can combine it with a later position of the index--... _positive\ntime-displacement_, as we shall call it; or finally we can combine\nit with a position of the index earlier than that at which the sound\noccurred--and this we will call a _negative displacement_. The most\nnatural displacement would apparently be the positive, since for\napperception a certain time is always required.... But experience\nshows that the opposite is the case: it happens most frequently\nthat the sound appears earlier than its real date--far less often\ncoincident with it, or later. It should be observed that in all\nthese experiments it takes some time to get a distinctly perceived\ncombination of the sound with a particular position of the index,\nand that a single revolution of the latter is never enough for the\npurpose. The motion must go on long enough for the sounds themselves\nto form a regular series--the outcome being a simultaneous perception\nof two distinct series of events, of which either may by changes in\nits rapidity modify the result. The first thing one remarks is that\nthe sound belongs in a certain region of the scale; only gradually\nis it perceived to combine with a particular position of the index.\nBut even a result gained by observation of many revolutions may be\ndeficient in certainty, for accidental combinations of attention\nhave a great influence upon it. If we deliberately try to combine\nthe bell-stroke with an arbitrarily chosen position of the index, we\nsucceed without difficulty, provided this position be not too remote\nfrom the true one. If, again, we cover the whole scale, except a\nsingle division over which we may see the index pass, we have a strong\ntendency to combine the bell-stroke with this actually seen position;\nand in so doing may easily overlook more than 1/4 of a second of\ntime. Results, therefore, to be of any value, must be drawn from\nlong-continued and very numerous observations, in which such irregular\noscillations of the attention neutralize each other according to the\nlaw of great numbers, and allow the true laws to appear. Although\nmy own experiments extend over many years (with interruptions), they\nare not even yet numerous enough to exhaust the subject--still, they\nbring out the principal laws which the attention follows under such\nconditions.\"[334]\nWundt accordingly distinguishes the _direction_ from the _amount_ of\nthe apparent displacement in time of the bell-stroke. The direction\ndepends on the rapidity of the movement of the index and (consequently)\non that of the succession of the bell-strokes. The moment at which\nthe bell struck was estimated by him with the least tendency to\nerror, when the revolutions took place once in a second. Faster than\nthis, _positive_ errors began to prevail; slower, _negative_ ones\nalmost always were present. On the other hand, if the rapidity went\n_quickening_, errors became _negative_; if _slowing, positive_. The\namount of error is, in general, the greater the slower the speed and\nits alterations. Finally, individual differences prevail, as well as\ndifferences in the same individual at different times.[335]\nWundt's pupil von Tschisch has carried out these experiments on a still\nmore elaborate scale,[336] using, not only the single bell-stroke, but\n2, 3, 4, or 5 simultaneous impressions, so that the attention had to\nnote the place of the index at the moment when a whole group of things\nwas happening. The single bell-stroke was always heard too early by\nvon Tschisch--the displacement was invariably 'negative.' As the other\nsimultaneous impressions were added, the displacement first became\nzero and finally positive, i.e. the impressions were connected with a\nposition of the index that was too late. This retardation was greater\nwhen the simultaneous impressions were disparate (electric tactile\nstimuli on different places, simple touch-stimuli, different sounds)\nthan when they were all of the same sort. The increment of retardation\nbecame relatively less with each additional impression, so that it is\nprobable that six impressions would have given almost the same result\nas five, which was the maximum number used by Herr von T.\nWundt explains all these results by his previous observation that a\nreaction sometimes antedates the signal (see above, p. 411). The mind,\nhe supposes, is so intent upon the bell-strokes that its 'apperception'\nkeeps ripening periodically after each stroke in anticipation of the\nnext. Its most natural rate of ripening may be faster or slower than\nthe rate at which the strokes come. If faster, then it hears the\nstroke too early; if slower, it hears it too late. The position of\nthe index on the scale, meanwhile, is noted at the moment, early or\nlate, at which the bell-stroke is subjectively heard. Substituting\nseveral impressions for the single bell-stroke makes the ripening of\nthe perception slower, and the index is seen too late. So, at least,\ndo I understand the explanations which Herren Wundt and v. Tschisch\ngive.[337]\nThis is all I have to say about the difficulty of having two discrepant\nconcepts together, and about the number of things to which we can\nsimultaneously attend.\nTHE VARIETIES OF ATTENTION.\nThe things to which we attend are said to _interest_ us. Our interest\nin them is supposed to be the _cause_ of our attending. What makes an\nobject interesting we shall see presently; and later inquire in what\nsense interest may cause attention. Meanwhile\nAttention may be divided into kinds in various ways. It is either to\n_a_) Objects of sense (sensorial attention); or to\n_b_) Ideal or represented objects (intellectual attention). It is either\n_c_) Immediate; or\n_d_) Derived: immediate, when the topic or stimulus is interesting in\nitself, without relation to anything else; derived, when it owes its\ninterest to association with some other immediately interesting thing.\nWhat I call derived attention has been named 'apperceptive' attention.\nFurthermore, Attention may be either\n_e_) Passive, reflex, non-voluntary, effortless; or\n_f_) Active and voluntary.\n_Voluntary attention is always derived_; we never make an _effort_ to\nattend to an object except for the sake of some _remote_ interest which\nthe effort will serve. But both sensorial and intellectual attention\nmay be either passive or voluntary.\nIn _passive immediate sensorial attention_ the stimulus is a\nsense-impression, either very intense, voluminous, or sudden,--in which\ncase it makes no difference what its nature may be, whether sight,\nsound, smell, blow, or inner pain,--or else it is an _instinctive_\nstimulus, a perception which, by reason of its nature rather than its\nmere force, appeals to some one of our normal congenital impulses and\nhas a directly exciting quality. In the chapter on Instinct we shall\nsee how these stimuli differ from one animal to another, and what most\nof them are in man: strange things, moving things, wild animals, bright\nthings, pretty things, metallic things, words, blows, blood, etc.,\netc., etc.\nSensitiveness to immediately exciting sensorial stimuli characterizes\nthe attention of childhood and youth. In mature age we have generally\nselected those stimuli which are connected with one or more so-called\npermanent interests, and our attention has grown irresponsive to the\nrest.[338] But childhood is characterized by great active energy, and\nhas few organized interests by which to meet new impressions and decide\nwhether they are worthy of notice or not, and the consequence is that\nextreme mobility of the attention with which we are all familiar in\nchildren, and which makes their first lessons such rough affairs. Any\nstrong sensation whatever produces accommodation of the organs which\nperceive it, and absolute oblivion, for the time being, of the task in\nhand. This reflex and passive character of the attention which, as a\nFrench writer says, makes the child seem to belong less to himself than\nto every object which happens to catch his notice, is the first thing\nwhich the teacher must overcome. It never is overcome in some people,\nwhose work, to the end of life, gets done in the interstices of their\nmind-wandering.\nThe passive sensorial attention is _derived_ when the impression,\nwithout being either strong or of an instinctively exciting nature, is\nconnected by previous experience and education with things that are\nso. These things may be called the _motives_ of the attention. The\nimpression draws an interest from them, or perhaps it even fuses into\na single complex object with them; the result is that it is brought\ninto the focus of the mind. A faint tap _per se_ is not an interesting\nsound; it may well escape being discriminated from the general rumor\nof the world. But when it is a signal, as that of a lover on the\nwindow-pane, it will hardly go unperceived. Herbart writes:\n\"How a bit of bad grammar wounds the ear of the purist! How a false\nnote hurts the musician! or an offence against good manners the man\nof the world! How rapid is progress in a science when its first\nprinciples have been so well impressed upon us that we reproduce them\nmentally with perfect distinctness and ease! How slow and uncertain,\non the other hand, is our learning of the principles themselves, when\nfamiliarity with the still more elementary percepts connected with the\nsubject has not given us an adequate predisposition!--Apperceptive\nattention may be plainly observed in very small children when,\nhearing the speech of their elders, as yet unintelligible to them,\nthey suddenly catch a single known word here and there, and repeat\nit to themselves; yes! even in the dog who looks round at us when\nwe speak of him and pronounce his name. Not far removed is the\ntalent which mind-wandering school-boys display during the hours of\ninstruction, of noticing every moment in which the teacher tells a\nstory. I remember classes in which, instruction being uninteresting,\nand discipline relaxed, a buzzing murmur was always to be heard,\nwhich invariably stopped for as long a time as an anecdote lasted.\nHow could the boys, since they seemed to hear nothing, notice when\nthe anecdote began? Doubtless most of them always heard something\nof the teacher's talk; but most of it had no connection with their\nprevious knowledge and occupations, and therefore the separate words\nno sooner entered their consciousness than they fell out of it again;\nbut, on the other hand, no sooner did the words awaken old thoughts,\nforming strongly-connected series with which the new impression easily\ncombined, than out of new and old together a total interest resulted\nwhich drove the vagrant ideas below the threshold of consciousness,\nand brought for a while settled attention into their place.\"[339]\n_Passive intellectual attention_ is immediate when we follow in thought\na train of images exciting or interesting _per se_; derived, when the\nimages are interesting only as means to a remote end, or merely because\nthey are associated with something which makes them dear. Owing to the\nway in which immense numbers of real things become integrated into\nsingle objects of thought for us, there is no clear line to be drawn\nbetween immediate and derived attention of an intellectual sort. When\nabsorbed in intellectual attention we may become so inattentive to\nouter things as to be 'absent-minded,' 'abstracted,' or '_distraits_.'\nAll revery or concentrated meditation is apt to throw us into this\nstate.\n\"Archimedes, it is well known, was so absorbed in geometrical\nmeditation that he was first aware of the storming of Syracuse by his\nown death-wound, and his exclamation on the entrance of the Roman\nsoldiers was: _Noli turbare circulos meos!_ In like manner Joseph\nScaliger, the most learned of men, when a Protestant student in\nParis, was so engrossed in the study of Homer that he became aware\nof the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and of his own escape, only on\nthe day subsequent to the catastrophe. The philosopher Carneades was\nhabitually liable to fits of meditation so profound that, to prevent\nhim sinking from inanition, his maid found it necessary to feed him\nlike a child. And it is reported of Newton that, while engaged in his\nmathematical researches, he sometimes forgot to dine. Cardan, one of\nthe most illustrious of philosophers and mathematicians, was once,\nupon a journey, so lost in thought that he forgot both his way and\nthe object of his journey. To the questions of his driver whether he\nshould proceed, he made no answer; and when he came to himself at\nnightfall, he was surprised to find the carriage at a standstill, and\ndirectly under a gallows. The mathematician Vieta was sometimes so\nburied in meditation that for hours he bore more resemblance to a dead\nperson than to a living, and was then wholly unconscious of everything\ngoing on around him. On the day of his marriage the great Bud\u00e6us\nforgot everything in his philological speculations, and he was only\nawakened to the affairs of the external world by a tardy embassy from\nthe marriage-party, who found him absorbed in the composition of his\n_Commentarii_.\"[340]\nThe absorption may be so deep as not only to banish ordinary\nsensations, but even the severest pain. Pascal, Wesley, Robert Hall,\nare said to have had this capacity. Dr. Carpenter says of himself that\n\"he has frequently begun a lecture whilst suffering neuralgic pain\nso severe as to make him apprehend that he would find it impossible\nto proceed; yet no sooner has he by a determined effort fairly\nlaunched himself into the stream of thought, than he has found himself\ncontinuously borne along without the least distraction, until the\nend has come, and the attention has been released; when the pain has\nrecurred with a force that has overmastered all resistance, making him\nwonder how he could have ever ceased to feel it.\"[341]\nDr. Carpenter speaks of launching himself by a determined _effort_.\nThis effort characterizes what we called _active or voluntary\nattention_. It is a feeling which every one knows, but which most\npeople would call quite indescribable. We get it in the sensorial\nsphere whenever we seek to catch an impression of extreme _faintness_,\nbe it of sight, hearing, taste, smell, or touch; we get it whenever we\nseek to _discriminate_ a sensation merged in a mass of others that are\nsimilar; we get it whenever we _resist the attractions_ of more potent\nstimuli and keep our mind occupied with some object that is naturally\nunimpressive. We get it in the intellectual sphere under exactly\nsimilar conditions: as when we strive to sharpen and make distinct\nan idea which we but vaguely seem to have; or painfully discriminate\na shade of meaning from its similars; or resolutely hold fast to a\nthought so discordant with our impulses that, if left unaided, it would\nquickly yield place to images of an exciting and impassioned kind.\nAll forms of attentive effort would be exercised at once by one whom\nwe might suppose at a dinner-party resolutely to listen to a neighbor\ngiving him insipid and unwelcome advice in a low voice, whilst all\naround the guests were loudly laughing and talking about exciting and\ninteresting things.\n_There is no such thing as voluntary attention sustained for more\nthan a few seconds at a time._ What is called sustained voluntary\nattention is a repetition of successive efforts which bring back the\ntopic to the mind.[342] The topic once brought back, if a congenial\none, _develops_; and if its development is interesting it engages\nthe attention passively for a time. Dr. Carpenter, a moment back,\ndescribed the stream of thought, once entered, as 'bearing him along.'\nThis passive interest may be short or long. As soon as it flags, the\nattention is diverted by some irrelevant thing, and then a voluntary\neffort may bring it back to the topic again; and so on, under favorable\nconditions, for hours together. During all this time, however, note\nthat it is not an identical _object_ in the psychological sense (p.\n275), but a succession of mutually related objects forming an identical\n_topic_ only, upon which the attention is fixed. _No one can possibly\nattend continuously to an object that does not change._\nNow there are always some objects that for the time being _will not\ndevelop_. They simply _go out_; and to keep the mind upon anything\nrelated to them requires such incessantly renewed effort that the most\nresolute Will ere long gives out and lets its thoughts follow the more\nstimulating solicitations after it has withstood them for what length\nof time it can. There are topics known to every man from which he shies\nlike a frightened horse, and which to get a glimpse of is to shun.\nSuch are his ebbing assets to the spendthrift in full career. But why\nsingle out the spendthrift when to every man actuated by passion the\nthought of interests which negate the passion can hardly for more than\na fleeting instant stay before the mind? It is like 'memento mori' in\nthe heyday of the pride of life. Nature rises at such suggestions, and\nexcludes them from the view:--How long, O healthy reader, can you now\ncontinue thinking of your tomb?--In milder instances the difficulty\nis as great, especially when the brain is fagged. One snatches at\nany and every passing pretext, no matter how trivial or external, to\nescape from the odiousness of the matter in hand. I know a person, for\nexample, who will poke the fire, set chairs straight, pick dust-specks\nfrom the floor, arrange his table, snatch up the newspaper, take down\nany book which catches his eye, trim his nails, waste the morning\n_anyhow_, in short, and all without premeditation,--simply because the\nonly thing he _ought_ to attend to Is the preparation of a noonday\nlesson in formal logic which he detests. Anything but _that!_\nOnce more, the object must change. When it is one of sight, it will\nactually become invisible; when of hearing, inaudible,--if we attend\nto it too unmovingly. Helmholtz, who has put his sensorial attention\nto the severest tests, by using his eyes on objects which in common\nlife are expressly overlooked, makes some interesting remarks on this\npoint in his chapter on retinal rivalry.[343] The phenomenon called\nby that name is this, that if we look with each eye upon a different\npicture (as in the annexed stereoscopic slide), sometimes one picture,\nsometimes the other, or parts of both, will come to consciousness, but\nhardly ever both combined. Helmholtz now says:\n\"I find that I am able to attend voluntarily, now to one and now to\nthe other system of lines; and that then this system remains visible\nalone for a certain time, whilst the other completely vanishes.\nThis happens, for example, whenever I try to count the lines first\nof one and then of the other system.... But it is extremely hard to\nchain the attention down to one of the systems for long, unless we\nassociate with our looking some distinct purpose which keeps the\nactivity of the attention perpetually renewed. Such a one is counting\nthe lines, comparing their intervals, or the like. An equilibrium\nof the attention, persistent for any length of time, is under no\ncircumstances attainable. The natural tendency of attention when left\nto itself is to wander to ever new things; and so soon as the interest\nof its object is over, so soon as nothing new is to be noticed there,\nit passes, in spite of our will, to something else. If we wish to\nkeep it upon one and the same object, we must seek constantly to find\nout something new about the latter, especially if other powerful\nimpressions are attracting us away.\"\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\nAnd again criticising an author who had treated of attention as an\nactivity absolutely subject to the conscious will, Helmholtz writes:\n\"This is only restrictedly true. We move our eyes by our will; but one\nwithout training cannot so easily execute the intention of making them\nconverge. At any moment, however, he can execute that of looking at a\nnear object, in which act convergence is involved. Now just as little\ncan we carry out our purpose to keep our attention steadily fixed\nupon a certain object, when our interest in the object is exhausted,\nand the purpose is inwardly formulated in this abstract way. _But\nwe can set ourselves new questions about the object, so that a new\ninterest in it arises, and then the attention will remain riveted._\nThe relation of attention to will is, then, less one of immediate than\nof mediate control.\"\nThese words of Helmholtz are of fundamental importance. And if true of\nsensorial attention, how much more true are they of the intellectual\nvariety! The _conditio sine qu\u00e2 non_ of sustained attention to a given\ntopic of thought is that we should roll it over and over incessantly\nand consider different aspects and relations of it in turn. Only in\npathological states will a fixed and ever monotonously recurring idea\npossess the mind.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAnd now we can see why it is that what is called sustained attention\nis the easier, the richer in acquisitions and the fresher and more\noriginal the mind. In such minds, subjects bud and sprout and grow. At\nevery moment, they please by a new consequence and rivet the attention\nafresh. But an intellect unfurnished with materials, stagnant,\nunoriginal, will hardly be likely to consider any subject long. A\nglance exhausts its possibilities of interest. Geniuses are commonly\nbelieved to excel other men in their power of sustained attention.[344]\nIn most of them, it is to be feared, the so-called 'power' is of the\npassive sort. Their ideas coruscate, every subject branches infinitely\nbefore their fertile minds, and so for hours they may be rapt. _But\nit is their genius making them attentive, not their attention making\ngeniuses of them._ And, when we come down to the root of the matter,\nwe see that they differ from ordinary men less in the character of\ntheir attention than in the nature of the objects upon which it is\nsuccessively bestowed. In the genius, these form a concatenated series,\nsuggesting each other mutually by some rational law. Therefore we call\nthe attention 'sustained' and the topic of meditation for hours 'the\nsame.' In the common man the series is for the most part incoherent,\nthe objects have no rational bond, and we call the attention wandering\nand unfixed.\nIt is probable that genius tends actually to prevent a man from\nacquiring habits of voluntary attention, and that moderate intellectual\nendowments are the soil in which we may best expect, here as elsewhere,\nthe virtues of the will, strictly so called, to thrive. But, whether\nthe attention come by grace of genius or by dint of will, the longer\none does attend to a topic the more mastery of it one has. And the\nfaculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over\nand over again, is the very root of judgment, character, and will.\nNo one is _compos sui_ if he have it not. An education which should\nimprove this faculty would be _the_ education _par excellence_. But\nit is easier to define this ideal than to give practical directions\nfor bringing it about. The only general pedagogic maxim bearing on\nattention is that the more interest the child has in advance in the\nsubject, the better he will attend. Induct him therefore in such a way\nas to knit each new thing on to some acquisition already there; and if\npossible awaken curiosity, so that the new thing shall seem to come as\nan answer, or part of an answer, to a question pre-existing in his mind.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAt present having described the varieties, let us turn to\nTHE EFFECTS OF ATTENTION.\nIts remote effects are too incalculable to be recorded. The practical\nand theoretical life of whole species, as well as of individual beings,\nresults from the selection which the habitual direction of their\nattention involves. In Chapters XIV and XV some of these consequences\nwill come to light. Suffice it meanwhile that each of us literally\n_chooses_, by his ways of attending to things, what sort of a universe\nhe shall appear to himself to inhabit.\nThe immediate effects of attention are to make us:\n_a_) perceive--\n_b_) conceive--\n_c_) distinguish--\n_d_) remember--\nbetter than otherwise we could--both more successive things and each\nthing more clearly. It also\n(_e_) shortens 'reaction-time.'\n*       *       *       *       *\n_a_ and _b_. Most people would say that a sensation attended to becomes\nstronger than it otherwise would be. This point is, however, not quite\nplain, and has occasioned some discussion.[345] From the strength or\nintensity of a sensation must be distinguished its clearness; and to\nincrease _this_ is, for some psychologists, the utmost that attention\ncan do. When the facts are surveyed, however, it must be admitted that\nto some extent the relative intensity of two sensations may be changed\nwhen one of them is attended to and the other not. Every artist knows\nhow he can make a scene before his eyes appear warmer or colder in\ncolor, according to the way he sets his attention. If for warm, he soon\nbegins to _see_ the red color start out of everything; if for cold, the\nblue. Similarly in listening for certain notes in a chord, or overtones\nin a musical sound, the one we attend to sounds probably a little more\nloud as well as more emphatic than it did before. When we mentally\nbreak a series of monotonous strokes into a rhythm, by accentuating\nevery second or third one, etc., the stroke on which the stress of\nattention is laid seems to become stronger as well as more emphatic.\nThe increased visibility of optical after-images and of double images,\nwhich close attention brings about, can hardly be interpreted otherwise\nthan as a real strengthening of the retinal sensations themselves.\nAnd this view is rendered particularly probable by the fact that an\nimagined visual object may, if attention be concentrated upon it long\nenough, acquire before the mind's eye almost the brilliancy of reality,\nand (in the case of certain exceptionally gifted observers) leave a\nnegative after-image of itself when it passes away (see Chapter XVIII).\nConfident expectation of a certain intensity or quality of impression\nwill often make us sensibly see or hear it in an object which really\nfalls far short of it. In face of such facts it is rash to say that\nattention cannot make a sense-impression more intense.\nBut, on the other hand, the intensification which may be brought about\nseems never to lead the judgment astray. As we rightly perceive and\nname the same color under various lights, the same sound at various\ndistances; so we seem to make an analogous sort of allowance for\nthe varying amounts of attention with which objects are viewed; and\nwhatever changes of feeling the attention may bring we charge, as it\nwere, to the attention's account, and still perceive and conceive the\nobject as the same.\n\"A gray paper appears to us no lighter, the pendulum-beat of a clock\nno louder, no matter how much we increase the strain of our attention\nupon them. No one, by doing this, can make the gray paper look\nwhite, or the stroke of the pendulum sound like the blow of a strong\nhammer,--everyone, on the contrary, feels the increase as that of his\nown conscious activity turned upon the thing.\"[346]\nWere it otherwise, we should not be able to note _intensities_ by\nattending to them. Weak impressions would, as Stumpf says,[347] become\nstronger by the very fact of being observed.\n\"I should not be able to observe faint sounds at all, but only such\nas appeared to me of maximal strength, or at least of a strength that\nincreased with the amount of my observation. In reality, however, I\ncan, with steadily increasing attention, follow a diminuendo perfectly\nwell.\"\nThe subject is one which would well repay exact experiment, if methods\ncould be devised. Meanwhile there is no question whatever that\nattention augments the _clearness_ of all that we perceive or conceive\nby its aid. But what is meant by clearness here?\n*       *       *       *       *\n_c. Clearness_, so far as attention produces it, _means distinction\nfrom other things_ and _internal analysis or subdivision_. These are\nessentially products of intellectual _discrimination_, involving\ncomparison, memory, and perception of various relations. The attention\n_per se_ does not distinguish and analyze and relate. The most we can\nsay is that it is a condition of our doing so. And as these processes\nare to be described later, the clearness they produce had better not be\nfarther discussed here. The important point to notice here is that it\nis not attention's _immediate_ fruit.[348]\n*       *       *       *       *\n_d._ Whatever future conclusion we may reach as to this, we cannot deny\nthat _an object once attended to will remain in the memory_, whilst\none inattentively allowed to pass will leave no traces behind. Already\nin Chapter VI (see pp. 163 ff.) we discussed whether certain states\nof mind were 'unconscious,' or whether they were not rather states to\nwhich no attention had been paid, and of whose passage recollection\ncould afterwards find no vestiges. Dugald Stewart says:[349] \"The\nconnection between attention and memory has been remarked by many\nauthors.\" He quotes Quintilian, Locke, and Helvetius; and goes on\nat great length to explain the phenomena of 'secondary automatism'\n(see above, p. 114 ff.) by the presence of a mental action grown so\ninattentive as to preserve no memory of itself. In our chapter on\nMemory, later on, the point will come up again.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_e_) Under this head, the _shortening of reaction-time_, there is a\ngood deal to be said of Attention's effects. Since Wundt has probably\nworked over the subject more thoroughly than any other investigator\nand made it peculiarly his own, what follows had better, as far as\npossible, be in his words. The reader will remember the method and\nresults of experimentation on 'reaction-time,' as given in Chapter III.\nThe facts I proceed to quote may also be taken as a supplement to that\nchapter. Wundt writes:\n\"When we wait with strained attention for a stimulus, it will often\nhappen that instead of registering the stimulus, we react upon some\nentirely different impression,--and this not through confounding the\none with the other. On the contrary, we are perfectly well aware\nat the moment of making the movement that we respond to the wrong\nstimulus. Sometimes even, though not so often, the latter may be\nanother kind of sensation altogether,--one may, for example, in\nexperimenting with sound, register a flash of light, produced either\nby accident or design. We cannot well explain these results otherwise\nthan by assuming that the strain of the attention towards the\nimpression we expect coexists with a preparatory innervation of the\nmotor centre for the reaction, which innervation the slightest shock\nthen suffices to turn into an actual discharge. This shock may be\ngiven by any chance impression, even by one to which we never intended\nto respond. When the preparatory innervation has once reached this\npitch of intensity, the time that intervenes between the stimulus and\nthe contraction of the muscles which react, may become vanishingly\nsmall.\"[350]\n\"The perception of an impression is facilitated when the impression\nis preceded by a warning which announces beforehand that it is about\nto occur. This case is realized whenever several stimuli follow each\nother at equal intervals,--when, e.g. we note pendulum movements by\nthe eye, or pendulum-strokes by the ear. Each single stroke forms\nhere the signal for the next, which is thus met by a fully prepared\nattention. The same thing happens when the stimulus to be perceived\nis preceded, at a certain interval, by a single warning: the time is\nalways notably shortened.... I have made comparative observations on\nreaction-time with and without a warning signal. The impression to be\nreacted on was the sound made by the dropping of a ball on the board\nof the 'drop apparatus.'... In a first series no warning preceded the\nstroke of the ball; in the second, the noise made by the apparatus in\nliberating the ball served as a signal.... Here are the averages of\ntwo series of such experiments:\nHeight of Fall.              Average.    Mean Error.  No. of Expts.\n25 cm.         {No warning   0.253       0.051        13\n{Warning      0.076       0.060        17\n5 cm.         {No warning   0.266       0.036        14\n{Warning      0.175       0.035        17\n\"... In a long series of experiments, (the interval between warning\nand stimulus remaining the same) the reaction-time grows less and\nless, and it is possible occasionally to reduce it to a vanishing\nquantity (a few thousandths of a second), to zero, or even to a\nnegative value.[351]... The only ground that we can assign for this\nphenomenon is _the preparation (vorbereitende Spannung) of the\nattention_. It is easy to understand that the reaction-time should be\nshortened by this means; but that it should sometimes sink to zero\nand even assume negative values, may appear surprising. Nevertheless\nthis latter case is also explained by what happens in the simple\nreaction-time experiments\" just referred to, in which, \"when the\nstrain of the attention has reached its climax, the movement we stand\nready to execute escapes from the control of on will, and we register\na wrong signal. In these other experiments, in which a warning\nforetells the moment of the stimulus, it is also plain that attention\naccommodates itself so exactly to the latter's reception that _no\nsooner is it objectively given than it is fully apperceived, and with\nthe apperception the motor discharge coincides_.\"[352]\nUsually, when the impression is fully anticipated, attention prepares\nthe motor centres so completely for both stimulus and reaction that\nthe only time lost is that of the physiological conduction downwards.\nBut even this interval may disappear, i.e. the stimulus and reaction\nmay become objectively contemporaneous; or more remarkable still,\nthe reaction may be discharged before the stimulus has actually\noccurred.[353] Wundt, as we saw some pages back (p. 411), explains this\nby the effort of the mind so to react that we may feel our own movement\nand the signal which prompts it, both at the same instant. As the\nexecution of the movement must precede our feeling of it, so it must\nalso precede the stimulus, if that and our movement are to be felt at\nonce.\nThe peculiar theoretic interest of these experiments lies in their\n_showing expectant attention and sensation to be continuous or\nidentical processes, since they may have identical motor effects_.\nAlthough other exceptional observations show them likewise to be\ncontinuous _subjectively_, Wundt's experiments do not: he seems never,\nat the moment of reacting prematurely, to have been misled into the\nbelief that the real stimulus was there.\nAs concentrated attention accelerates perception, so, conversely,\nperception of a stimulus is _retarded by anything which either baffles\nor distracts the attention_ with which we await it.\n\"If, e.g., we make reactions on a sound in such a way that weak and\nstrong stimuli irregularly alternate so that the observer can never\nexpect a determinate strength with any certainty, the reaction-time\nfor _all_ the various signals is increased,--and so is the average\nerror. I append two examples.... In Series I a strong and a weak\nsound alternated regularly, so that the intensity was each time known\nin advance. In II they came irregularly.\nI. _Regular Alternation._\nAverage Time.  Average Error.  No. of Expts.\nStrong sound           0.116\"         0.010\"          18\nWeak sound             0.127\"         0.012\"           9\nII. _Irregular Alternation._\nStrong sound           0.189\"         0.038\"           9\nWeak sound             0.298\"         0.076\"          15\n\"Still greater is the increase of the time when, unexpectedly into a\nseries of strong impressions, a weak one is interpolated, or _vice\nvers\u00e2_. In this way I have seen the time of reaction upon a sound\nso weak as to be barely perceived rise to 0.4\" or 0.5\", and for a\nstrong sound to 0 25\". It is also matter of general experience that a\nstimulus expected in a general way, but for whose intensity attention\ncannot be adapted in advance, demands a longer reaction-time. In\nsuch cases ... the reason for the difference can only lie in the\nfact that wherever a preparation of the attention is impossible, the\ntime of both perception and volition is prolonged. Perhaps also the\nconspicuously large reaction-times which are got with stimuli so faint\nas to be just perceptible may be explained by the attention tending\nalways to adapt itself for something more than this minimal amount\nof stimulus, so that a state ensues similar to that in the case of\nunexpected stimuli.... Still more than by previously unknown stimuli\nis the reaction-time prolonged by _wholly unexpected_ impressions.\nThis is sometimes accidentally brought about, when the observer's\nattention, instead of being concentrated on the coming signal, is\ndispersed. It can be realized purposely by suddenly thrusting into\na long series of equidistant stimuli a much shorter interval which\nthe observer does not expect. The mental effect here is like that of\nbeing startled;--often the startling is outwardly visible. The time\nof reaction may then easily be lengthened to one quarter of a second\nwith strong signals, or with weak ones to a half-second. Slighter, but\nstill very noticeable, is the retardation when the experiment is so\narranged that the observer, ignorant whether the stimulus is to be an\nimpression of light, sound, or touch, cannot keep his attention turned\nto any particular sense-organ in advance. One notices then at the same\ntime a peculiar unrest, as the feeling of strain which accompanies the\nattention keeps vacillating between the several senses.\n\"Complications of another sort arise when what is registered is\nan impression anticipated both in point of quality and strength,\nbut accompanied by other stimuli which make the concentration of\nthe attention difficult. The reaction-time is here always more or\nless prolonged. The simplest case of the sort is where a momentary\nimpression is registered in the midst of another, and continuous,\nsensorial-stimulation of considerable strength. The continuous\nstimulus may belong to the same sense as the stimulus to be reacted\non, or to another. When it is of the same sense, the retardation it\ncauses may be partly due to the distraction of the attention by it,\nbut partly also to the fact that the stimulus to be reacted on stands\nout less strongly than if alone, and practically becomes a less\nintense sensation. But other factors in reality are present; for we\nfind the reaction-time more prolonged by the concomitant stimulation\nwhen the stimulus is weak than when it is strong I made experiments\nin which the principal impression, or signal for reaction, was a\nbell-stroke whose strength could be graduated by a spring against the\nhammer with a movable counterpoise. Each set of observations comprised\ntwo series; in one of which the bell-stroke was registered in the\nordinary way, whilst in the other a toothed wheel belonging to the\nchronometric apparatus made during the entire experiment a steady\nnoise against a metal spring. In one half of the latter series (A)\nthe bell-stroke was only moderately strong, so that the accompanying\nnoise diminished it considerably, without, however, making it\nindistinguishable. In the other half (B) the bell-sound was so loud as\nto be heard with perfect distinctness above the noise.\nMean.  Maximum.  Minimum.

This influence is freed from mixture with other\nfactors when the momentary stimulus and the concomitant disturbance\nappeal to different senses. I chose, to test this, sight and hearing.\nThe momentary signal was an induction-spark leaping from one platinum\npoint to another against a dark background. The steady stimulation was\nthe noise above described.\nSpark.         Mean.  Maximum.  Minimum.

One does not, in fact, find it\nparticularly hard to register immediately, when the bell rings in the\nmidst of the noise; but when the spark is the signal one has a feeling\nof being coerced, as one turns away from the noise towards it. This\nfact is immediately connected with other properties of our attention.\nThe effort of the latter is accompanied by various corporeal\nsensations, according to the sense which is engaged. The innervation\nwhich exists during the effort of attention is therefore probably a\ndifferent one for each sense-organ.\"[354]\nWundt then, after some theoretical remarks which we need not quote now,\ngives a table of retardations, as follows:\nRetardation.\n1.  Unexpected strength of impression:\n_a_) Unexpectedly strong sound                    0.073\n_b_) Unexpectedly weak sound                      0.171\n2.  Interference by like stimulus (sound by sound)    0.045[355]\n3.  Interference by unlike stimulus (light by sound)  0.078\nIt seems probable, from these results obtained with elementary\nprocesses of mind, that all processes, even the higher ones of\nreminiscence, reasoning, etc., whenever attention is concentrated upon\nthem instead of being diffused and languid, are thereby more rapidly\nperformed.[356]\n*       *       *       *       *\nStill more interesting reaction-time observations have been made by\nM\u00fcnsterberg. The reader will recollect the fact noted in Chapter\nIII (p. 93) that reaction-time is shorter when one concentrates his\nattention on the expected movement than when one concentrates it on the\nexpected signal. Herr M\u00fcnsterberg found that this is equally the case\nwhen the reaction is no simple reflex, but can take place only after\nan intellectual operation. In a series of experiments the five fingers\nwere used to react with, and the reacter had to use a different finger\naccording as the signal was of one sort or another. Thus when a word in\nthe nominative case was called out he used the thumb, for the dative\nhe used another finger; similarly adjectives, substantives, pronouns,\nnumerals, etc., or, again, towns, rivers, beasts, plants, elements;\nor poets, musicians, philosophers, etc., were co-ordinated each with\nits finger, so that when a word belonging to either of these classes\nwas mentioned, a particular finger and no other had to perform the\nreaction. In a second series of experiments the reaction consisted\nin the utterance of a word in answer to a question, such as \"name an\nedible fish,\" etc.; or \"name the first drama of Schiller,\" etc.; or\n\"which is greater, Hume or Kant?\" etc.; or (first naming apples and\ncherries, and several other fruits) \"which do you prefer, apples or\ncherries?\" etc.; or \"which is Goethe's finest drama?\" etc.; or \"which\nletter comes the later in the alphabet, the letter L or the first\nletter of the most beautiful tree?\" etc.; or \"which is less, 15 or 20\n_minus_ 8?\"[357] etc. etc. etc. Even in this series of reactions _the\ntime was much quicker token the reacter turned his attention in advance\ntowards the answer than when he turned it towards the question_. The\nshorter reaction-time was seldom more than one fifth of a second; the\nlonger, from four to eight times as long.\nTo understand such results, one must bear in mind that in these\nexperiments the reacter always knew in advance in a general way the\n_kind_ of question which he was to receive, and consequently the\n_sphere within which_ his possible answer lay.[358] In turning his\nattention, therefore, from the outset towards the answer, those\nbrain-processes in him which were connected with this entire 'sphere'\nwere kept sub-excited, and the question could then discharge with a\nminimum amount of lost time that particular answer out of the 'sphere'\nwhich belonged especially to it. When, on the contrary, the attention\nwas kept looking towards the question exclusively and averted from\nthe possible reply, all this preliminary sub-excitement of motor\ntracts failed to occur, and the entire process of answering had to\nbe gone through with _after_ the question was heard. No wonder that\nthe time was prolonged. It is a beautiful example of the summation\nof stimulations, and of the way in which expectant attention, even\nwhen not very strongly focalized, will prepare the motor centres, and\nshorten the work which a stimulus has to perform on them, in order to\nproduce a given effect when it comes.\nTHE INTIMATE NATURE OF THE ATTENTIVE PROCESS.\nWe have now a sufficient number of facts to warrant our considering\nthis more recondite question. And two physiological processes, of which\nwe have got a glimpse, immediately suggest themselves as possibly\nforming in combination a complete reply. I mean\n1. _The accommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs_; and\n2. _The anticipatory preparation from within of the ideational centres\nconcerned with the object to which the attention is paid._\n1. The sense-organs and the bodily muscles which favor their exercise\nare adjusted most energetically in sensorial attention, whether\nimmediate and reflex, or derived. But there are good grounds for\nbelieving that even intellectual attention, attention to the _idea_ of\na sensible object, is also accompanied with some degree of excitement\nof the sense-organs to which the object appeals. The preparation of the\nideational centres exists, on the other hand, wherever our interest in\nthe object--be it sensible or ideal--is _derived_ from, or in any way\nconnected with, other interests, or the presence of other objects, in\nthe mind. It exists as well when the attention thus derived is classed\nas passive as when it is classed as voluntary. So that on the whole\nwe may confidently conclude--since in mature life we never attend to\nanything without our interest in it being in some degree derived from\nits connection with other objects--that _the two processes of sensorial\nadjustment and ideational preparation probably coexist in all our\nconcrete attentive acts._\nThe two points must now be proved in more detail. First, as respects\nthe sensorial adjustment.\nThat it is present when we attend to _sensible_ things is obvious. When\nwe look or listen we accommodate our eyes and ears involuntarily, and\nwe turn our head and body as well; when we taste or smell we adjust\nthe tongue, lips, and respiration to the object; in feeling a surface\nwe move the palpatory organ in a suitable way; in all these acts,\nbesides making involuntary muscular contractions of a positive sort,\nwe inhibit others which might interfere with the result--we close the\neyes in tasting, suspend the respiration in listening, etc. The result\nis a more or less massive organic feeling that attention is going on.\nThis organic feeling comes, in the way described on page 302, to be\ncontrasted with that of the objects which it accompanies, and regarded\nas peculiarly ours, whilst the objects form the not-me. We treat it\nas a sense of our _own activity_, although it comes in to us from\nour organs after they are accommodated, just as the feeling of any\nobject does. Any object, if _immediately_ exciting, causes a reflex\naccommodation of the sense-organ, and this has two results--first, the\nobject's increase in clearness; and second, the feeling of activity in\nquestion. Both are sensations of an 'afferent' sort.\nBut in _intellectual_ attention, as we have already seen, (p. 300),\nsimilar feelings of activity occur. Fechner was the first, I believe,\nto analyze these feelings, and discriminate them from the stronger ones\njust named. He writes:\n\"When we transfer the attention from objects of one sense to those of\nanother, we have an indescribable feeling (though at the same time\none perfectly determinate, and reproducible at pleasure), of altered\n_direction_ or differently localized tension (_Spannung_). We feel\na strain forward in the eyes, one directed sidewise in the ears,\nincreasing with the degree of our attention, and changing according as\nwe look at an object carefully, or listen to something attentively;\nand we speak accordingly of _straining the attention_. The difference\nis most plainly felt when the attention oscillates rapidly between eye\nand ear; and the feeling localizes itself with most decided difference\nin regard to the various sense-organs, according as we wish to\ndiscriminate a thing delicately by touch, taste, or smell.\n\"But now I have, when I try to vividly recall a picture of memory or\nfancy, a feeling perfectly analogous to that which I experience when\nI seek to apprehend a thing keenly by eye or ear; and this analogous\nfeeling is very differently localized. While in sharpest possible\nattention to real objects (as well as to after-images) the strain\nis plainly forwards, and when the attention changes from one sense\nto another only alters its direction between the several external\nsense-organs, leaving the rest of the head free from strain, the\ncase is different in memory or fancy, for here the feeling withdraws\nentirely from the external sense-organs, and seems rather to take\nrefuge in that part of the head which the brain fills; if I wish, for\nexample, to recall a place or person it will arise before me with\nvividness, not according as I strain my attention forwards, but rather\nin proportion as I, so to speak, retract it backwards.\"[359]\nIn myself the 'backward retraction' which is felt during attention\nto ideas of memory, etc., seems to be principally constituted by the\nfeeling of an actual rolling outwards and upwards of the eyeballs, such\nas occurs in sleep, and is the exact opposite of their behavior when we\nlook at a physical thing. I have already spoken of this feeling on page\n300.[360] The reader who doubts the presence of these organic feelings\nis requested to read the whole of that passage again.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt has been said, however, that we may attend to an object on the\nperiphery of the visual field and yet not accommodate the eye for\nit. Teachers thus notice the acts of children in the school-room at\nwhom they appear not to be looking. Women in general train their\nperipheral visual attention more than men. This would be an objection\nto the _invariable and universal_ presence of movements of adjustment\nas ingredients of the attentive process. Usually, as is well known,\nno object lying in the marginal portions of the field of vision can\ncatch our attention without at the same time 'catching our eye'--that\nis, fatally provoking such movements of rotation and accommodation as\nwill focus its image on the fovea, or point of greatest sensibility.\nPractice, however, enables us, _with effort_, to attend to a marginal\nobject whilst keeping the eyes immovable. The object under these\ncircumstances never becomes perfectly distinct--the place of its image\non the retina makes distinctness impossible--but (as anyone can satisfy\nhimself by trying) we become more vividly conscious of it than we were\nbefore the effort was made. Helmholtz states the fact so strikingly\nthat I will quote his observation in full. He was trying to combine\nin a single solid percept pairs of stereoscopic pictures illuminated\ninstantaneously by the electric spark. The pictures were in a dark box\nwhich the spark from time to time lighted up; and, to keep the eyes\nfrom wandering betweenwhiles, a pin-hole was pricked through the middle\nof each picture, through which the light of the room came, so that\neach eye had presented to it during the dark intervals a single bright\npoint. With parallel optical axes the points combined into a single\nimage; and the slightest movement of the eyeballs was betrayed by this\nimage at once becoming double. Helmholtz now found that simple linear\nfigures could, when the eyes were thus kept immovable, be perceived\nas solids at a single flash of the spark. But when the figures were\ncomplicated photographs, many successive flashes were required to grasp\ntheir totality.\n\"Now it is interesting,\" he says, \"to find that, although we keep\nsteadily fixating the pin-holes and never allow their combined image\nto break into two, we can, nevertheless, before the spark comes, keep\nour attention voluntarily turned to any particular portion we please\nof the dark field, so as then, when the spark comes, to receive an\nimpression only from such parts of the picture as lie in this region.\nIn this respect, then, our attention is quite independent of the\nposition and accommodation of the eyes, and of any known alteration in\nthese organs; and free to direct itself by a conscious and voluntary\neffort upon any selected portion of a dark and undifferenced field\nof view. This is one of the most important observations for a future\ntheory of attention.\"[361]\nHering, however, adds the following detail:\n\"Whilst attending to the marginal object we must always,\" he says,\n\"_attend at the same time_ to the object directly fixated. If even for\na single instant we let the latter slip out of our mind, our eye moves\ntowards the former, as may be easily recognized by the after-images\nproduced, or by the muscular sounds heard. The case is then less\nproperly to be called one of translocation, than one of unusually wide\n_dispersion_, of the attention, in which dispersion the largest share\nstill falls upon the thing directly looked at,\"[362]\nand consequently directly accommodated for. Accommodation exists here,\nthen, as it does elsewhere, and without it we should lose a part\nof our sense of attentive activity. In fact, the _strain_ of that\nactivity (which is remarkably great in the experiment) is due in part\nto unusually strong contractions of the muscles needed to keep the\neyeballs still, which produce unwonted feelings of pressure in those\norgans.\n*       *       *       *       *\n2. But if the peripheral part of the picture in this experiment be\nnot physically accommodated for, what is meant by its sharing our\nattention? What happens when we 'distribute' or 'disperse' the latter\nupon a thing for which we remain unwilling to 'adjust'? This leads us\nto that second feature in the process, the '_ideational preparation_'\nof which we spoke. _The effort to attend to the marginal region of\nthe picture consists in nothing more nor less than the effort to form\nas clear an idea as is possible of what is there portrayed._ The idea\nis to come to the help of the sensation and make it more distinct. It\ncomes with effort, and such a mode of coming is the remaining part of\nwhat we know as our attention's 'strain' under the circumstances.\nLet us show how universally present in our acts of attention this\nreinforcing imagination, this inward reproduction, this anticipatory\nthinking of the thing we attend to, is.\nIt must as a matter of course be present when the attention is of the\nintellectual variety, for the thing attended to then _is_ nothing but\nan idea, an inward reproduction or conception. If then we prove ideal\nconstruction of the object to be present in _sensorial_ attention, it\nwill be present everywhere. When, however, sensorial attention is at\nits height, it is impossible to tell how much of the percept comes from\nwithout and how much from within; but if we find that the _preparation_\nwe make for it always partly consists of the creation of an imaginary\nduplicate of the object in the mind, which shall stand ready to receive\nthe outward impression as if in a matrix, that will be quite enough to\nestablish the point in dispute.\nIn Wundt's and Exner's experiments quoted above, the lying in wait for\nthe impressions, and the preparation to react, consist of nothing but\nthe anticipatory imagination of what the impressions or the reactions\nare to be. Where the stimulus is unknown and the reaction undetermined,\ntime is lost, because no stable image can under such circumstances\nbe formed in advance. But where both nature and time of signal and\nreaction are foretold, so completely does the expectant attention\nconsist in premonitory imagination that, as we have seen (Footnote 273;\npp. 373, 377), it may mimic the intensity of reality, or at any rate\nproduce reality's motor effects. It is impossible to read Wundt's and\nExner's pages of description and not to interpret the '_Apperception_'\nand '_Spannung_' and other terms as equivalents of _imagination_. With\nWundt, in particular, the word _Apperception_ (which he sets great\nstore by) is quite interchangeable with both imagination and attention.\nAll three are names for the excitement from within of ideational\nbrain-centres, for which Mr. Lewes's name of _preperception_ seems the\nbest possible designation.\nWhere the impression to be caught is very weak, the way not to miss it\nis to sharpen our attention for it by preliminary contact with it in a\nstronger form.\n\"If we wish to begin to observe overtones, it is advisable, just\nbefore the sound which is to be analyzed, to sound very softly the\nnote of which we are in search.... The piano and harmonium are well\nfitted for this use, as both give overtones that are strong. Strike\nupon the piano first the _g'_ [of a certain musical example previously\ngiven in the text]; then, when its vibrations have objectively ceased,\nstrike powerfully the note _c_, in whose sound _g'_ is the third\novertone, and keep your attention steadily bent upon the pitch of the\njust heard _g'_; you will now hear this tone sounding in the midst of\nthe _c_.... If you place the resonator which corresponds to a certain\novertone, for example _g'_ of the sound _c_, against your ear, and\nthen make the note _c_ sound, you will hear _g'_ much strengthened by\nthe resonator.... This strengthening by the resonator can be used to\nmake the naked ear attentive to the sound which it is to catch. For\nwhen the resonator is gradually removed, the _g'_ grows weaker; but\nthe attention, once directed to it, holds it now more easily fast, and\nthe observer hears the tone _g'_ now in the natural unaltered sound of\nthe note with his unaided ear.\"[363]\nWundt, commenting on experiences of this sort, says that\n\"on carefully observing, one will always find that one tries first\nto recall the image in memory of the tone to be heard, and that then\none hears it in the total sound. The same thing is to be noticed\nin weak or fugitive visual impressions. Illuminate a drawing by\nelectric sparks separated by considerable intervals, and after the\nfirst, and often after the second and third spark, hardly anything\nwill be recognized. But the confused image is held fast in memory;\neach successive illumination completes it; and so at last we attain\nto a clearer perception. The primary motive to this inward activity\nproceeds usually from the outer impression itself. We hear a sound in\nwhich, from certain associations, we suspect a certain overtone; the\nnext thing is to recall the overtone in memory; and finally we catch\nit in the sound we hear. Or perhaps we see some mineral substance\nwe have met before; the impression awakens the memory-image, which\nagain more or less completely melts with the impression itself. In\nthis way every idea takes a certain time to penetrate to the focus\nof consciousness. And during this time we always find in ourselves\nthe peculiar _feeling_ of attention.... The phenomena show that an\n_adaptation_ of attention to the impression takes place. The surprise\nwhich unexpected impressions give us is due essentially to the fact\nthat our attention, at the moment when the impression occurs, is not\naccommodated for it. The accommodation itself is of the double sort,\nrelating as it does to the intensity as well as to the quality of\nthe stimulus. Different qualities of impression require disparate\nadaptations. And we remark that our feeling of the _strain_ of our\ninward attentiveness increases with every increase in the strength of\nthe impressions on whose perception we are intent.\"[364]\nThe natural way of conceiving all this is under the symbolic form\nof a brain-cell played upon from two directions. Whilst the object\nexcites it from without, other brain-cells, or perhaps spiritual\nforces, arouse it from within. The latter influence is the 'adaptation\nof the attention.' _The plenary energy of the brain-cell demands the\nco-operation of both factors:_ not when merely present, but when both\npresent and attended to, is the object fully perceived.\nA few additional experiences will now be perfectly clear. Helmholtz,\nfor instance, adds this observation to the passage we quoted a while\nago concerning the stereoscopic pictures lit by the electric spark.\n\"These experiments,\" he says, \"are interesting as regards the part\nwhich attention plays in the matter of double images.... For in\npictures so simple that it is relatively difficult for me to see\nthem double, I can succeed in seeing them double, even when the\nillumination is only instantaneous, the moment I strive to _imagine in\na lively way how they ought then to look_. The influence of attention\nis here pure; for all eye movements are shut out.\"[365]\nIn another place[366] the same writer says:\n\"When I have before my eyes a pair of stereoscopic drawings which\nare hard to combine, it is difficult to bring the lines and points\nthat correspond, to cover each other, and with every little motion of\nthe eyes they glide apart. _But if I chance to gain a lively mental\nimage (Anschauungsbild) of the represented solid form_ (a thing that\noften occurs by lucky chance), I then move my two eyes with perfect\ncertainty over the figure without the picture separating again.\"\nAgain, writing of retinal rivalry, Helmholtz says:\n\"It is not a trial of strength between two sensations, but depends on\nour fixing or failing to fix the attention. Indeed, there is scarcely\nany phenomenon so well fitted for the study of the causes which are\ncapable of determining the attention. It is not enough to form the\nconscious intention of seeing first with one eye and then with the\nother; _we must form as clear a notion as possible of what we expect\nto see. Then it will actually appear_.\"[367]\nIn figures 37 and 38, where the result is ambiguous, we can make the\nchange from one apparent form to the other by imagining strongly in\nadvance the form we wish to see. Similarly in those puzzles where\ncertain lines in a picture form by their combination an object that has\nno connection with what the picture ostensibly represents; or indeed in\nevery case where an object is inconspicuous and hard to discern from\nthe background; we may not be able to see it for a long time; but,\nhaving once seen it, we can attend to it again whenever we like, on\naccount of the mental duplicate of it which our imagination now bears.\nIn the meaningless French words '_pas de lieu Rh\u00f4ne que nous_,' who\ncan recognize immediately the English 'paddle your own canoe'?[368]\nBut who that has once noticed the identity can fail to have it arrest\nhis attention again? When watching for the distant clock to strike,\nour mind is so filled with its image that at every moment we think\nwe hear the longed-for or dreaded sound. So of an awaited footstep.\nEvery stir in the wood is for the hunter his game; for the fugitive\nhis pursuers. Every bonnet in the street is momentarily taken by the\nlover to enshroud the head of his idol. The image in the mind _is_ the\nattention; the _preperception_, as Mr. Lewes calls it, is half of the\nperception of the looked-for thing.[369]\n[Illustration: FIGS. 37 & 38.]\nIt is for this reason that men have no eyes but for those aspects of\nthings which they have already been taught to discern. Any one of us\ncan notice a phenomenon after it has once been pointed out, which not\none in ten thousand could ever have discovered for himself. Even in\npoetry and the arts, some one has to come and tell us what aspects we\nmay single out, and what effects we may admire, before our \u00e6sthetic\nnature can 'dilate' to its full extent and never 'with the wrong\nemotion.' In kindergarten instruction one of the exercises is to make\nthe children see how many features they can point out in such an object\nas a flower or a stuffed bird. They readily name the features they\nknow already, such as leaves, tail, bill, feet. But they may look for\nhours without distinguishing nostrils, claws, scales, etc., until their\nattention is called to these details; thereafter, however, they see\nthem every time. In short, _the only things which we commonly see are\nthose which we preperceive_. and the only things which we preperceive\nare those which have been labelled for us, and the labels stamped into\nour mind. If we lost our stock of labels we should be intellectually\nlost in the midst of the world.\n*       *       *       *       *\nOrganic adjustment, then, and ideational preparation or preperception\nare concerned in all attentive acts. An interesting theory is defended\nby no less authorities than Professors Bain[370] and Ribot,[371] and\nstill more ably advocated by Mr. N. Lange,[372] who will have it\nthat the ideational preparation itself is a consequence of muscular\nadjustment, so that the latter may be called the essence of the\nattentive process throughout. This at least is what the theory of these\nauthors practically amounts to, though the former two do not state it\nin just these terms. The proof consists in the exhibition of cases of\nintellectual attention which organic adjustment accompanies, or of\nobjects in thinking which we have to execute a movement. Thus Lange\nsays that when he tries to imagine a certain colored circle, he finds\nhimself first making with his eyes the movement to which the circle\ncorresponds, and _then_ imagining the color, etc., as a consequence of\nthe movement.\n\"Let my reader,\" he adds, \"close his eyes and think of an extended\nobject, for instance a _pencil_. He will easily notice that he first\nmakes a slight movement [of the eyes] corresponding to the straight\nline, and that he often gets a weak feeling of innervation of the hand\nas if touching the pencil's surface. So, in thinking of a certain\nsound, we turn towards its direction or repeat muscularly its rhythm,\nor articulate an imitation of it.\"[373]\nBut it is one thing to point out the presence of muscular contractions\nas constant concomitants of our thoughts, and another thing to\nsay, with Herr Lange, that thought is _made possible_ by muscular\ncontraction alone. It may well be that where the object of thought\nconsists of two parts, one perceived by movement and another not, the\npart perceived by movement is habitually called up first and fixed\nin the mind by the movement's execution, whilst the other part comes\nsecondarily as the movement's mere associate. But even were this the\nrule with all men (which I doubt[374]), it would only be a practical\nhabit, not an ultimate necessity. In the chapter on the Will we shall\nlearn that movements themselves are results of images coming before the\nmind, images sometimes of feelings in the moving part, sometimes of the\nmovement's effects on eye and ear, and sometimes (if the movement be\noriginally reflex or instinctive), of its natural stimulus or exciting\ncause. It is, in truth, contrary to all wider and deeper analogies to\ndeny that any quality of feeling whatever can directly rise up in the\nform of an idea, and to assert that only ideas of movement can call\nother ideas to the mind.\nSo much for adjustment and preperception. The only third process I can\nthink of as always present is the inhibition of irrelevant movements\nand ideas. This seems, however, to be a feature incidental to voluntary\nattention rather than the essential feature of attention at large,[375]\nand need not concern us particularly now. Noting merely the intimate\nconnection which our account so far establishes between attention,\non the one hand, and imagination, discrimination, and memory, on the\nother, let us draw a couple of practical inferences, and then pass to\nthe more speculative problem that remains.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe practical inferences are pedagogic. First, _to strengthen attention\nin children_ who care nothing for the subject they are studying and\nlet their wits go wool-gathering. The interest here must be 'derived'\nfrom something that the teacher associates with the task, a reward or a\npunishment if nothing less external comes to mind. Prof. Ribot says:\n\"A child refuses to read; he is incapable of keeping his mind fixed\non the letters, which have no attraction for him; but he looks with\navidity upon the pictures contained in a book. 'What do they mean?'\nhe asks. The father replies: 'When you can read, the book will tell\nyou.' After several colloquies like this, the child resigns himself\nand falls to work, first slackly, then the habit grows, and finally\nhe shows an ardor which has to be restrained. This is a case of the\ngenesis of voluntary attention. An artificial and indirect desire has\nto be grafted on a natural and direct one. Reading has no immediate\nattractiveness, but it has a borrowed one, and that is enough. The\nchild is caught in the wheelwork, the first step is made.\"\nI take another example, from M. B. Perez:[376]\n\"A child of six years, habitually prone to mind-wandering, sat down\none day to the piano of his own accord to repeat an air by which his\nmother had been charmed. His exercises lasted an hour. The same child\nat the age of seven, seeing his brother busy with tasks in vacation,\nwent and sat at his father's desk. 'What are you doing there?' his\nnurse said, surprised at so finding him. 'I am,' said the child,\n'learning a page of German; it isn't very amusing, but it is for an\nagreeable surprise to mamma.'\"\nHere, again, a birth of voluntary attention, grafted this time on a\nsympathetic instead of a selfish sentiment like that of the first\nexample. The piano, the German, awaken no spontaneous attention; but\nthey arouse and maintain it by borrowing a force from elsewhere.[377]\nSecond, take that mind-wandering which at a later age may trouble us\n_whilst reading or listening to a discourse_. If attention be the\nreproduction of the sensation from within, the habit of reading not\nmerely with the eye, and of listening not merely with the ear, but of\narticulating to one's self the words seen or heard, ought to deepen\none's attention to the latter. Experience shows that this is the\ncase. I can keep my wandering mind a great deal more closely upon a\nconversation or a lecture if I actively re-echo to myself the words\nthan if I simply hear them; and I find a number of my students who\nreport benefit from voluntarily adopting a similar course.[378]\nSecond, _a teacher who wishes to engage the attention of his class\nmust knit his novelties on to things of which they already have\npreperceptions_. The old and familiar is readily attended to by\nthe mind and helps to hold in turn the new, forming, in Herbartian\nphraseology, an '_Apperceptionsmasse_' for it. Of course it is in every\ncase a very delicate problem to know what 'Apperceptionsmasse' to use.\nPsychology can only lay down the general rule.\nIS VOLUNTARY ATTENTION A RESULTANT OR A FORCE?\nWhen, a few pages back, I symbolized the 'ideational preparation'\nelement in attention by a brain-cell played upon from within, I added\n'by other brain-cells, or by some spiritual force,' without deciding\nwhich. The question 'which?' is one of those central psychologic\nmysteries which part the schools. When we reflect that the turnings\nof our attention form the nucleus of our inner self; when we see (as\nin the chapter on the Will we shall see) that volition is nothing but\nattention; when we believe that our autonomy in the midst of nature\ndepends on our not being pure effect, but a cause,--\n_Principium quoddam quod fati f\u0153dera rumpat,_\n_Ex infinito ne causant causa sequatur--_\nwe must admit that the question whether attention involve such a\nprinciple of spiritual activity or not is metaphysical as well as\npsychological, and is well worthy of all the pains we can bestow on its\nsolution. It is in fact the pivotal question of metaphysics, the very\nhinge on which our picture of the world shall swing from materialism,\nfatalism, monism, towards spiritualism, freedom, pluralism,--or else\nthe other way.\nIt goes back to the automaton-theory. If feeling is an inert\naccompaniment, then of course the brain-cell can be played upon only\nby other brain-cells, and the attention which we give at any time\nto any subject, whether in the form of sensory adaptation or of\n'preperception,' is the fatally predetermined _effect_ of exclusively\nmaterial laws. If, on the other hand, the feeling which coexists with\nthe brain-cells' activity reacts dynamically upon that activity,\nfurthering or checking it, then the attention is in part, at least,\na _cause_. It does not necessarily follow, of course, that this\nreactive feeling should be 'free' in the sense of having its amount\nand direction undetermined in advance, for it might very well be\npredetermined in all these particulars. If it were so, our attention\nwould not be _materially_ determined, nor yet would it be 'free' in the\nsense of being spontaneous or unpredictable in advance. The question is\nof course a purely speculative one, for we have no means of objectively\nascertaining whether our feelings react on our nerve-processes or not;\nand those who answer the question in either way do so in consequence\nof general analogies and presumptions drawn from other fields. As mere\n_conceptions_, the effect-theory and the cause-theory of attention are\nequally clear; and whoever affirms either conception to be true must do\nso on metaphysical or universal rather than on scientific or particular\ngrounds.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAs regards _immediate sensorial attention_ hardly any one is tempted to\nregard it as anything but an effect.[379] We are 'evolved' so as to\nrespond to special stimuli by special accommodative acts which produce\nclear perceptions on the one hand in us, and on the other hand such\nfeelings of inner activity as were above described. The accommodation\nand the resultant feeling _are_ the attention. We don't bestow it, the\nobject draws it from us. The object has the initiative, not the mind.\n_Derived attention, where there is no voluntary effort, seems also\nmost plausibly to be a mere effect._ The object again takes the\ninitiative and draws our attention to itself, not by reason of its\nown intrinsic interest, but because it is connected with some other\ninteresting thing. Its brain-process is connected with another that is\neither excited, or tending to be excited, and the liability to share\nthe excitement and become aroused is the liability to 'preperception'\nin which the attention consists. If I have received an insult, I may\nnot be actively thinking of it all the time, yet the thought of it\nis in such a state of heightened irritability, that the place where\nI received it or the man who inflicted it cannot be mentioned in my\nhearing without my attention bounding, as it were, in that direction,\nas the imagination of the whole transaction revives. Where such a\nstirring-up occurs, organic adjustment must exist as well, and the\nideas must innervate to some degree the muscles. Thus the whole process\nof involuntary derived attention is accounted for if we grant that\nthere is something interesting enough to arouse and fix the thought\nof whatever may be connected with it. This fixing _is_ the attention;\nand it carries with it a vague sense of activity going on, and of\nacquiescence, furtherance, and adoption, which makes us feel the\nactivity to be our own.\nThis reinforcement of ideas and impressions by the pre-existing\ncontents of the mind was what Herbart had in mind when he gave the name\nof _apperceptive_ attention to the variety we describe. We easily see\nnow why the lover's tap should be heard--it finds a nerve-centre half\nready in advance to explode. We see how we can attend to a companion's\nvoice in the midst of noises which pass unnoticed though objectively\nmuch louder than the words we hear. Each word is _doubly_ awakened;\nonce from without by the lips of the talker, but already before that\nfrom within by the premonitory processes irradiating from the previous\nwords, and by the dim arousal of all processes that are connected with\nthe 'topic' of the talk. The irrelevant noises, on the other hand, are\nawakened only once. They form an unconnected train. The boys at school,\ninattentive to the teacher except when he begins an anecdote, and then\nall pricking up their ears, are as easily explained. The words of the\nanecdote shoot into association with exciting objects which react and\nfix them; the other words do not. Similarly with the grammar heard by\nthe purist and Herbart's other examples quoted on page 418.\nEven where the attention is voluntary, it is possible to conceive of\nit as an effect, and not a cause, a product and not an agent. The\nthings we attend to _come to us_ by their own laws. Attention _creates_\nno idea; an idea must already be there before we can attend to it.\nAttention only fixes and retains what the ordinary laws of association\nbring 'before the footlights' of consciousness. But the moment we admit\nthis we see that the attention _per se_, the _feeling_ of attending\nneed no more fix and retain the ideas than it need bring them. The\nassociates which bring them also fix them by the interest which they\nlend. In short, voluntary and involuntary attention may be essentially\nthe same. It is true that where the ideas are intrinsically very\nunwelcome and the effort to attend to them is great, it seems to us\nas if the frequent renewal of the effort were the very cause by which\nthey are held fast, and we naturally think of the effort as an original\nforce. In fact it is only to the _effort to attend_, not to the mere\n_attending_, that we are seriously tempted to ascribe spontaneous\npower. We think we can make more of it _if we will_; and the amount\nwhich we make does not seem a fixed function of the ideas themselves,\nas it would necessarily have to be if our effort were an effect and not\na spiritual force. But even here it is possible to conceive the facts\nmechanically and to regard the effort as a mere effect.\nEffort is felt only where there is a conflict of interests in the\nmind. The idea A may be intrinsically exciting to us. The idea Z may\nderive its interest from association with some remoter good. A may\nbe our sweetheart, Z may be some condition of our soul's salvation.\nUnder these circumstances, if we succeed in attending to Z at all it\nis always with expenditure of effort. The 'ideational preparation,'\nthe 'preperception' of A keeps going on of its own accord, whilst\nthat of Z needs incessant pulses of voluntary reinforcement--that\nis, we have the _feeling_ of voluntary reinforcement (or effort) at\neach successive moment in which the thought of Z flares brightly up\nin our mind. Dynamically, however, that may mean only this: that the\nassociative processes which make Z triumph are really the stronger, and\nin A's absence would make us give a 'passive' and unimpeded attention\nto Z; but, so long as A is present, some of of their force is used to\ninhibit the processes concerned with A. Such inhibition is a partial\nneutralization of the brain-energy which would otherwise be available\nfor fluent thought. But what is lost for thought is converted into\nfeeling, in this case into the peculiar feeling of effort, difficulty,\nor strain.\nThe stream of our thought is like a river. On the whole easy simple\nflowing predominates in it, the drift of things is with the pull of\ngravity, and effortless attention is the rule. But at intervals an\nobstruction, a set-back, a log-jam occurs, stops the current, creates\nan eddy, and makes things temporarily move the other way. If a real\nriver could feel, it would feel these eddies and set-backs as places\nof effort. \"I am here flowing,\" it would say, \"in the direction of\ngreatest resistance, instead of flowing, as usual, in the direction of\nleast. My effort is what enables me to perform this feat.\" Really, the\neffort would only be a passive index that the feat was being performed.\nThe agent would all the while be the total downward drift of the rest\nof the water, forcing _some_ of it upwards in this spot; and although,\n_on the average_, the direction of least resistance is downwards, that\nwould be no reason for its not being upwards now and then. Just so with\nour voluntary acts of attention. They are momentary arrests, coupled\nwith a peculiar feeling, of portions of the stream. But the arresting\nforce, instead of being this peculiar feeling itself, may be nothing\nbut the processes by which the collision is produced. The feeling of\neffort may be 'an accompaniment,' as Mr. Bradley says, 'more or less\nsuperfluous,' and no more contribute to the result than the pain in a\nman's finger, when a hammer falls on it, contributes to the hammer's\nweight. Thus the notion that our effort in attending is an original\nfaculty, a force additional to the others of which brain and mind are\nthe seat, may be an abject superstition. Attention may have to go, like\nmany a faculty once deemed essential, like many a verbal phantom, like\nmany an idol of the tribe. It may be an excrescence on Psychology. No\nneed of it to drag ideas before consciousness or fix them, when we see\nhow perfectly they drag and fix each other there.\n*       *       *       *       *\nI have stated the effect-theory as persuasively as I can.[380] It\nis a clear, strong, well-equipped conception, and like all such, is\nfitted to carry conviction, where there is no contrary proof. The\nfeeling of effort certainly _may_ be an inert accompaniment and not the\nactive element which it seems. No measurements are as yet performed\n(it is safe to say none ever will be performed) which can show that\nit contributes energy to the result. We _may_ then regard attention\nas a superfluity, or a 'Luxus,' and dogmatize against its causal\nfunction with no feeling in our hearts but one of pride that we are\napplying Occam's razor to an entity that has multiplied itself 'beyond\nnecessity.'\nBut Occam's razor, though a very good rule of method, is certainly no\nlaw of nature. The laws of stimulation and of association may well\nbe indispensable actors in all attention's performances, and may\neven be a good enough 'stock-company' to carry on many performances\nwithout aid; and yet they _may_ at times simply form the background\nfor a 'star-performer,' who is no more their 'inert accompaniment' or\ntheir 'incidental product' than Hamlet is Horatio's and Ophelia's.\nSuch a star-performer would be the voluntary effort to attend, if it\nwere an original psychic force. Nature _may_, I say, indulge in these\ncomplications; and the conception that she has done so in this case\nis, I think, just as clear (if not as 'parsimonious' logically) as the\nconception that she has not. To justify this assertion, _let us ask\njust what the effort to attend would effect if it were an original\nforce_.\nIt would deepen and prolong the stay in consciousness of innumerable\nideas which else would fade more quickly away. The delay thus gained\nmight not be more than a second in duration--but that second might be\n_critical_; for in the constant rising and falling of considerations\nin the mind, where two associated systems of them are nearly in\nequilibrium it is often a matter of but a second more or less of\nattention at the outset, whether one system shall gain force to occupy\nthe field and develop itself, and exclude the other, or be excluded\nitself by the other. When developed, it may make us act; and that act\nmay seal our doom. When we come to the chapter on the Will, we shall\nsee that the whole drama of the voluntary life hinges on the amount\nof attention, slightly more or slightly less, which rival motor ideas\nmay receive. But the whole feeling of reality, the whole sting and\nexcitement of our voluntary life, depends on our sense that in it\nthings are _really being decided_ from one moment to another, and that\nit is not the dull rattling off of a chain that was forged innumerable\nages ago. This appearance, which makes life and history tingle with\nsuch a tragic zest, _may_ not be an illusion. As we grant to the\nadvocate of the mechanical theory that it may be one, so he must\ngrant to us that it may _not_. And the result is two conceptions of\npossibility face to face with no facts definitely enough known to stand\nas arbiter between them.\nUnder these circumstances, one can leave the question open whilst\nwaiting for light, or one can do what most speculative minds do,\nthat is, look to one's general philosophy to incline the beam. The\nbelievers in mechanism do so without hesitation, and they ought not\nto refuse a similar privilege to the believers in a spiritual force.\nI count myself among the latter, but as my reasons are ethical they\nare hardly suited for introduction into a psychological work.[381]\nThe last word of psychology here is ignorance, for the 'forces'\nengaged are certainly too delicate and numerous to be followed in\ndetail. Meanwhile, in view of the strange arrogance with which the\nwildest materialistic speculations persist in calling themselves\n'science,' it is well to recall just what the reasoning is, by which\nthe effect-theory of attention is confirmed. It is an argument from\nanalogy, drawn from rivers, reflex actions and other material phenomena\nwhere no consciousness _appears_ to exist at all, and extended to\ncases where consciousness seems the phenomenon's essential feature.\n_The consciousness doesn't count,_ these reasoners say; it doesn't\nexist for science, it is _nil_; you mustn't think about it at all. The\nintensely reckless character of all this needs no comment. It is making\nthe mechanical theory true _per fas aut nefas_. For the sake of that\ntheory we make inductions from phenomena to others that are startlingly\n_unlike_ them; and we assume that a complication which Nature has\nintroduced (the presence of feeling and of effort, namely) is not\nworthy of scientific recognition at all. Such conduct may conceivably\nbe _wise_, though I doubt it; but scientific, as contrasted with\nmetaphysical, it cannot seriously be called.[382]\nINATTENTION.\nHaving spoken fully of attention, let me add a word about _inattention_.\nWe do not notice the ticking of the clock, the noise of the city\nstreets, or the roaring of the brook near the house; and even the\ndin of a foundry or factory will not mingle with the thoughts of its\nworkers, if they have been there long enough. When we first put on\nspectacles, especially if they be of certain curvatures, the bright\nreflections they give of the windows, etc., mixing with the field of\nview, are very disturbing. In a few days we ignore them altogether.\nVarious entoptic images, _musc\u00e6 volitantes_, etc., although constantly\npresent, are hardly ever known. The pressure of our clothes and\nshoes, the beating of our hearts and arteries, our breathing, certain\nsteadfast bodily pains, habitual odors, tastes in the mouth, etc., are\nexamples from other senses, of the same lapse into unconsciousness\nof any too unchanging content--a lapse which Hobbes has expressed in\nthe well-known phrase, \"_Semper idem sentire ac non sentire ad idem\nrevertunt_.\"\nThe cause of the unconsciousness is certainly not the mere blunting of\nthe sense-organs. Were the sensation important, we should notice it\nwell enough; and we can at any moment notice it by expressly throwing\nour attention upon it,[383] provided it have not become so inveterate\nthat inattention to it is ingrained in our very constitution, as in the\ncase of the _musc\u00e6 volitantes_ the double retinal images, etc. But even\nin these cases artificial conditions of observation and patience soon\ngive us command of the impression which we seek. The inattentiveness\nmust then be a habit grounded on higher conditions than mere sensorial\nfatigue.\nHelmholtz has formulated a general law of inattention which we shall\nhave to study in the next chapter but one. Helmholtz's law is that we\nleave all impressions unnoticed which are valueless to us as signs by\nwhich to _discriminate things_. At most such impressions fuse with\ntheir consorts into an aggregate effect. The upper partial tones\nwhich make human voices differ make them differ as wholes only--we\ncannot dissociate the tones themselves. The odors which form integral\nparts of the characteristic taste of certain substances, meat, fish,\ncheese, butter, wine, do not come as odors to our attention. The\nvarious muscular and tactile feelings that make up the perception of\nthe attributes 'wet,' 'elastic,' 'doughy,' etc., are not singled out\nseparately for what they are. And all this is due to an inveterate\nhabit we have contracted, of passing from them immediately to their\nimport and letting their substantive nature alone. They have formed\nconnections in the mind which it is now difficult to break; they are\nconstituents of processes which it is hard to arrest, and which differ\naltogether from what the processes of catching the attention would be.\nIn the cases Helmholtz has in mind, not only we but our ancestors have\nformed these habits. In the cases we started from, however, of the\nmill-wheel, the spectacles, the factory din, the tight shoes, etc., the\nhabits of inattention are more recent, and the manner of their genesis\nseems susceptible, hypothetically at least, of being traced.\nHow _can_ impressions that are not needed by the intellect be thus\nshunted off from all relation to the rest of consciousness? Professor\nG. E. M\u00fcller has made a plausible reply to this question, and most of\nwhat follows is borrowed from him.[384] He begins with the fact that\n\"When we first come out of a mill or factory, in which we have\nremained long enough to get wonted to the noise, we feel as if\nsomething were _lacking_. Our total feeling of existence is different\nfrom what it was when we were in the mill.... A friend writes to me:\n'I have in my room a little clock which does not run quite twenty-four\nhours without winding. In consequence of this, it often stops. So\nsoon as this happens, I notice it, whereas I naturally fail to notice\nit when going. When this first began to happen, there was this\nmodification: I suddenly felt an undefined uneasiness or sort of void,\nwithout being able to say what was the matter; and only after some\nconsideration did I find the cause in the stopping of the clock.'\"\nThat the stopping of an unfelt stimulus may itself be felt is a\nwell-known fact: the sleeper in church who wakes when the sermon\nends; the miller who does the same when his wheel stands still, are\nstock examples. Now (since every impression falling on the nervous\nsystem must propagate itself somewhither), M\u00fcller suggests that\nimpressions which come to us when the thought-centres are preoccupied\nwith other matters may thereby be blocked or inhibited from invading\nthese centres, and may then overflow into lower paths of discharge.\nAnd he farther suggests that if this process recur often enough, the\nside-track thus created will grow so permeable as to be used, no matter\nwhat may be going on in the centres above. In the acquired inattention\nmentioned, the constant stimulus always caused disturbance _at first_;\nand consciousness of it was extruded successfully only when the brain\nwas _strongly excited_ about other things. Gradually the extrusion\nbecame easier, and at last automatic.\nThe side-tracks which thus learn to draft off the stimulations that\ninterfere with thought cannot be assigned with any precision. They\nprobably terminate in organic processes, or insignificant muscular\ncontractions which, when stopped by the cessation of their instigating\ncause, immediately give us the feeling that something is gone from our\nexistence (as M\u00fcller says), or (as his friend puts it) the feeling of a\nvoid.[385]\nM\u00fcller's suggestion awakens another. It is a well-known fact that\npersons striving to keep their attention on a difficult subject will\nresort to movements of various unmeaning kinds, such as pacing the\nroom, drumming with the fingers, playing with keys or watch-chain,\nscratching head, pulling mustache, vibrating foot, or what not,\naccording to the individual. There is an anecdote of Sir W. Scott,\nwhen a boy, rising to the head of his class by cutting off from the\njacket of the usual head-boy a button which the latter was in the habit\nof twirling in his fingers during the lesson. The button gone, its\nowner's power of reciting also departed.--Now much of this activity\nis unquestionably due to the overflow of emotional excitement during\nanxious and concentrated thought. It drains away nerve-currents\nwhich if pent up within the thought-centres would very likely make\nthe confusion there worse confounded. But may it not also be a means\nof drafting off all the irrelevant sensations of the moment, and so\nkeeping the attention more exclusively concentrated upon its inner\ntask? Each individual usually has his own peculiar habitual movement of\nthis sort. A downward nerve-path is thus kept constantly open during\nconcentrated thought; and as it seems to be a law of frequent (if not\nof universal) application, that incidental stimuli tend to discharge\nthrough paths that are already discharging rather than through\nothers, the whole arrangement might protect the thought-centres from\ninterference from without. Were this the true _rationale_ of these\npeculiar movements, we should have to suppose that the sensations\nproduced by each phase of the movement itself are also drafted off\nimmediately by the next phase and help to keep the circular process\nagoing. I offer the suggestion for what it is worth; the connection\nof the movements themselves with the continued effort of attention is\ncertainly a genuine and curious fact.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[322] Bain mentions attention in the Senses and the Intellect, p. 558,\nand even gives a theory of it on pp. 370-374 of the Emotions of the\nWill. I shall recur to this theory later on.\n[323] \"The first and most important, but also the most difficult, task\nat the outset of an education is to overcome gradually the inattentive\ndispersion of mind which shows itself wherever the organic life\npreponderates over the intellectual. The training of animals ... must\nbe in the first instance based on the awakening of attention (cf.\nAdrian Leonard, _Essai sur l'Education des Animaux_, Lille, 1842), that\nis to say, we must seek to make them gradually perceive separately\nthings which, if left to themselves, would not be attended to, because\nthey would fuse with a great sum of other sensorial stimuli to a\nconfused total impression of which each separate item only darkens and\ninterferes with the rest. Similarly at first with the human child. The\nenormous difficulties of deaf-mute- and especially of idiot-instruction\nis principally due to the slow and painful manner in which we succeed\nin bringing out from the general confusion of perception single items\nwith sufficient sharpness.\" (Waitz, Lehrb. d. Psychol., p. 632.)\n[324] Elements, part i, chap. ii, _fin._\n[325] Lectures on Metaphysics, lecture xiv.\n[326] Nature, vol. iii, p. 281 (1871).\n[327] If a lot of dots or strokes on a piece of paper be exhibited for\na moment to a person in _normal_ condition, with the request that he\nsay how many are there, he will find that they break into groups in his\nmind's eye, and that whilst he is analyzing and counting one group in\nhis memory the others dissolve. In short, the impression made by the\ndots changes rapidly into something else. In the _trance-subject_, on\nthe contrary, it seems to _stick_; I find that persons in the hypnotic\nstate easily count the dots in the mind's eye so long as they do not\nmuch exceed twenty in number.\n[328] Mr. Cattell made Jevons's experiment in a much more precise way\n(Philosophische Studien, iii, 121 ff.). Cards were ruled with short\nlines, varying in number from four to fifteen, and exposed to the eye\nfor a hundredth of a second. When the number was but four or five, no\nmistakes as a rule were made. For higher numbers the tendency was to\nunder- rather than to over-estimate. Similar experiments were tried\nwith letters and figures, and gave the same result. When the letters\nformed familiar words, three times as many of them could be named as\nwhen their combination was meaningless. If the words formed a sentence,\ntwice as many of them could be caught as when they had no connection.\n\"The sentence was then apprehended as a whole. If not apprehended thus,\nalmost nothing is apprehended of the several words; but if the sentence\nas a whole is apprehended, then the words appear very distinct.\"--Wundt\nand his pupil Dietze had tried similar experiments on rapidly repeated\nstrokes of sound. Wundt made them follow each other in groups, and\nfound that groups of twelve strokes at most could be recognized and\nidentified when they succeeded each other at the most favorable rate,\nnamely, from three to five tenths of a second (Phys. Psych., ii, 215).\nDietze found that by mentally subdividing the groups into sub-groups\nas one listened, as many as forty strokes could be identified as a\nwhole. They were then grasped as eight sub-groups of five, or as five\nof eight strokes each. (Philosophische Studien, ii, 362.)--Later in\nWundt's Laboratory, Bechterew made observations on two _simultaneously_\nelapsing series of metronome strokes, of which one contained one\nstroke more than the other. The most favorable rate of succession was\n0.3 sec., and he then discriminated a group of 18 from one of 18 + 1,\napparently. (Neurologisches Centralblatt, 1889, 272.)\n[329] Revue Scientifique, vol. 39, p. 684 (May 28, 1887).\n[330] Cf. Chr. Wolff: Psychologia Empirica, \u00a7 245. Wolff's account of\nthe phenomena of attention is in general excellent.\n[331] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, xi, 429-31.\n[332] Physiol. Psych., 2d ed. ii, pp. 238-40.\n[333] _Ib._ p. 262.\n[334] Physiol. Psych., 2d ed. ii, 264-6.\n[335] This was the original 'personal equation' observation of Bessel.\nAn Observer looked through his equatorial telescope to note the moment\nat which a star crossed the meridian, the latter being marked in the\ntelescopic field of view by a visible thread, beside which other\nequidistant threads appear. \"Before the star reached the thread he\nlooked at the clock, and then, with eye at telescope, counted the\nseconds by the beat of the pendulum. Since the star seldom passed\nthe meridian at the exact moment of a beat, the observer, in order\nto estimate fractions, had to note its position at the stroke before\nand at the stroke after the passage, and to divide the time as the\nmeridian-line seemed to divide the space. If, e.g., one had counted\n20 seconds, and at the 21st the star seemed removed by _ac_ from the\nmeridian-thread _c_, whilst at the 22d it was at the distance _bc_;\nthen, if _ac: bc_:: 1: 2, the star would have passed at 21 1/8 seconds.\nThe conditions resemble those in our experiment: the star is the\nindex-hand, the threads are the scale; and a time-displacement is to\nbe expected, which with high rapidities may be positive, and negative\nwith low. The astronomic observations do not permit us to measure its\nabsolute amount; but that it exists is made certain by the fact than\nafter all other possible errors are eliminated, there still remains\nbetween different observers a personal difference which is often much\nlarger than that between mere reaction-times, amounting ... sometimes\nto more than a second.\" (_Op. cit._ p. 270.)\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\n[336] Philosophische Studien, ii, 601.\n[337] Physiol. Psych., 2d ed. ii, 273-4; 3d ed. ii, 339; Philosophische\nStudien, ii, 621 ff.--I know that I am stupid, but I confess I find\nthese theoretical statements, especially Wundt's, a little hazy.\nHerr v. Tschisch considers it impossible that the perception of the\nindex's position should come in too late, and says it demands no\nparticular attention (p. 622). It seems, however, that this can hardly\nbe the case. Both observers speak of the difficulty of seeing the\nindex at the right moment. The case is quite different from that of\ndistributing the attention impartially over simultaneous momentary\nsensations. The bell or other signal gives a momentary sensation, the\nindex a continuous one, of motion. To note any one _position_ of the\nlatter is to _interrupt_ this sensation of motion and to substitute an\nentirely different percept--one, namely, of position--for it, during\na time however brief. This involves a sudden change in the manner of\nattending to the revolutions of the index; which change _ought_ to\ntake place neither sooner nor later than the momentary impression, and\n_fix_ the index as it is then and there visible. Now this is not a case\nof simply getting two sensations at once and so feeling them--which\nwould be an harmonious act; but of _stopping one_ and changing it into\nanother, whilst we simultaneously get a third. Two of these acts are\ndiscrepant, and the whole three rather interfere with each other. It\nbecomes hard to 'fix' the index at the very instant that we catch the\nmomentary impression; so we fall into a way of fixing it either at the\nlast possible moment before, or at the first possible moment after, the\nimpression comes.\nThis at least seems to me the more probable state of affairs. If we\nfix the index before the impression really comes, that means that\nwe perceive it too late. But why do we fix it _before_ when the\nimpressions come slow and simple, and _after_ when they come rapid and\ncomplex? And why under certain conditions is there no displacement\nat all? The answer which suggests itself is that when there is just\nenough leisure between the impressions for the attention to adapt\nitself comfortably both to them and to the index (one second in W.'s\nexperiments), it carries on the two processes at once; when the leisure\nis excessive, the attention, following its own laws of ripening, and\nbeing _ready_ to note the index before the other impression comes,\nnotes it _then_, since that is the moment of easiest action, whilst\nthe impression, which comes a moment later, interferes with noting\nit again; and finally, that when the leisure is insufficient, the\nmomentary impressions, being the more fixed data, are attended to\nfirst, and the index is fixed a little later on. The noting of the\nindex at too early a moment would be the noting of a real fact, with\nits analogue in many other rhythmical experiences. In reaction-time\nexperiments, for example, when, in a regularly recurring series, the\nstimulus is once in a while omitted, the observer sometimes reacts\nas if it came. Here, as Wundt somewhere observes, we catch ourselves\nacting merely because our inward preparation is complete. The\n'fixing' of the index is a sort of action; so that my interpretation\ntallies with facts recognized elsewhere; but Wundt's explanation (if\nI understand it) of the experiments requires us to believe that an\nobserver like v. Tschisch shall steadily and without exception get an\nhallucination of a bell-stroke before the latter occurs, and _not hear\nthe real bell-stroke afterwards_. I doubt whether this is possible,\nand I can think of no analogue to it in the rest of our experience.\nThe whole subject deserves to be gone over again. To Wundt is due\nthe highest credit for his patience in working out the facts. His\nexplanation of them in his earlier work (Vorlesungen \u00fcb. Menschen und\nThierseele, i, 37-42, 365-371) consisted merely in the appeal to the\nunity of consciousness, and may be considered quite crude.\n[338] Note that the permanent interests are themselves grounded in\ncertain objects and relations in which our interest is immediate and\ninstinctive.\n[339] Herbart: Psychologie als Wissenschaft, \u00a7 128.\n[340] Sir W. Hamilton. Metaphysics, lecture xiv.\n[341] Mental Physiol., \u00a7 124. The oft-cited case of soldiers not\nperceiving that they are wounded is of an analogous sort.\n[342] Prof. J. M. Cattell made experiments to which we shall refer\nfurther on, on the degree to which reaction-times might be shortened by\ndistracting or voluntarily concentrating the attention. He says of the\nlatter series that \"the averages show that the attention can be kept\nstrained, that is, the centres kept in a state of unstable equilibrium,\nfor one second\" (Mind, xi, 240).\n[343] Physiologische Optik, \u00a7 32.\n[344] \"'Genius,' says Helvetius, 'is nothing but a continued attention\n(_une attention suivie_).'

Cattell (Mind, xi, 33) found,\non repeating Wundt's experiments with a disturbing noise upon two\npractised observers, that the simple reaction-time either for light\nor sound was hardly perceptibly increased. Making strong voluntary\nconcentration of attention shortened it by about 0.013 seconds on an\naverage (p. 240). Performing mental additions whilst waiting for the\nstimulus lengthened it more than anything, apparently. For other,\nless careful, observations, compare Obersteiner, in Brain, i, 439.\nCattell's negative results show how far some persons can abstract their\nattention from stimuli by which others would be disturbed.--A. Bartels\n(Versuche \u00fcber die Ablenkung d. Aufmerksamkeit, Dorpat, 1889) found\nthat a stimulus to one eye sometimes prevented, sometimes improved, the\nperception of a quickly ensuing very faint stimulus to the other.\n[356] Cf. Wundt, Physiol. Psych., 1st ed. p. 794.\n[357] Beitr\u00e4ge zur Experimentellen Psychologie, Heft i, pp. 73-106\n(1889).\n[358] To say the very least, he always brought his articulatory\ninnervation close to the discharging point. Herr M. describes a\ntightening of the head-muscles as characteristic of the attitude of\nattention to the reply.\n[359] Psychophysik, Bd. ii, pp. 475-6.\n[360] I must say that I am wholly unconscious of the peculiar feelings\nin the scalp which Fechner goes on to describe. \"The feeling of\nstrained attention in the different sense-organs seems to be only a\nmuscular one produced in using these various organs by setting in\nmotion, by a sort of reflex action, the muscles which belong to them.\nOne can ask, then, with what particular muscular contraction the sense\nof strained attention in the effort to recall something is associated?\nOn this question my own feeling gives me a decided answer; it comes to\nme distinctly, not as a sensation of tension in the inside of the head,\nbut as a feeling of strain and contraction in the scalp with a pressure\nfrom without inwards over the whole cranium, undoubtedly caused by a\ncontraction of the muscles of the scalp. This harmonizes very well with\nthe German popular expression _den Kopf zusammennehmen_, etc., etc. In\na former illness, in which I could not endure the slightest effort of\ncontinuous thought, and had no theoretical bias on this question, the\nmuscles of the scalp, especially those of the occiput, assumed a fairly\nmorbid degree of sensibility whenever I tried to _think_.\" (_Ibid._\npp. 490-491.) In an early writing by Professor Mach, after speaking\nof the way in which by attention we decompose complex musical sounds\ninto their elements, this investigator continues: \"It is more than\na figure of speech when one says that we 'search' among the sounds.\nThis hearkening search is very observably a bodily activity, just like\nattentive looking in the case of the eye. If, obeying the drift of\nphysiology, we understand by attention nothing mystical, but a bodily\ndisposition, it is most natural to seek it in the variable tension\nof the muscles of the ear. Just so, what common men call attentive\nlooking reduces itself mainly to accommodating and setting of the\noptic axes.... According to this, it seems to me a very plausible view\nthat quite generally Attention has its seat in the mechanism of the\nbody. If nervous work is being done through certain channels, that by\nitself is a mechanical ground for other channels being closed.\" (Wien.\nSitzungsberichte, Math.

Arabesques of\nmonochromic many-convoluted lines now strike us as composed of one,\nnow of another connected linear system, and all without any intention\non our part. [This is beautifully seen in Moorish patterns; but a\nsimple diagram like Fig. 39 also shows it well. We see it sometimes\nas two large triangles superposed, sometimes as a hexagon with angles\nspanning its sides, sometimes as six small triangles stuck together at\ntheir corners.]... Often it happens in revery that when we stare at a\npicture, suddenly some one of its features will be lit up with especial\nclearness, although neither its optical character nor its meaning\ndiscloses any motive for such an arousal of the attention.... To one\nin process of becoming drowsy the surroundings alternately fade into\ndarkness and abruptly brighten up. The talk of the bystanders seems now\nto come from indefinite distances; but at the next moment it startles\nus by its threatening loudness at our very ear,\" etc. These variations,\nwhich everyone will have noticed, are, it seems to me, easily\nexplicable by the very unstable equilibrium of our ideational centres,\nof which constant change is the law. We _conceive_ one set of lines as\nobject, the other as background, and forthwith the first set becomes\nthe set we _see_. There need be no _logical_ motive for the conceptual\nchange, the irradiations of brain-tracts by each other, according to\naccidents of nutrition, 'like sparks in burnt-up paper,' suffice. The\nchanges during drowsiness are still more obviously due to this cause.\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\n[370] The Emotions and the Will, 3d ed. p. 370.\n[371] Psychologie de l'Attention (1889), p. 32 ff.\n[372] Philosophische Studien, iv, 413 ff.\n[373] See Lange, _loc. cit._ p. 417, for another proof of his view,\ndrawn from the phenomenon of retinal rivalry.\n[374] Many of my students have at my request experimented with imagined\nletters of the alphabet and syllables, and they tell me that they\ncan see them inwardly as total colored pictures without following\ntheir outlines with the eye.

The author\nwhose treatment of the subject is by far the most thorough and\nsatisfactory is Prof. G. E. M\u00fcller, whose little work Zur Th\u00e9orie der\nsinnlichen Aufmerksamkeit, Inauguraldissertation, Leipzig, Edelmann\n(1874?), is for learning and acuteness a model of what a monograph\nshould be. I should like to have quoted from it, but the Germanism\nof its composition makes quotation quite impossible. See also G. H.\nLewes: Problems of Life and Mind, 3d Series, Prob. 2, chap. 10; G.\nH.

As a matter of fact, one might begin to take one's stand against\nthe effect theory at the outset, with the phenomenon of immediate\nsensorial attention. One might say that attention causes the movements\nof adjustment of the eyes, for example, and is not merely their effect.\nHering writes most emphatically to this effect: \"The movements from\none point of fixation to another are occasioned and regulated by the\nchanges of place of the attention. When an object, seen at first\nindirectly, draws our attention to itself, the corresponding movement\nof the eye follows without further ado, as a consequence of the\nattention's migration and of our effort to make the object distinct.\nThe wandering of the attention entails that of the fixation point.\nBefore its movement begins, its goal is already in consciousness and\ngrasped by the attention, and the location of this spot in the total\nspace seen is what determines the direction and amount of the movement\nof the eye.\" (Hermann's Handbuch, p. 534.) I do not here insist on\nthis, because it is hard to tell whether the attention or the movement\ncomes first (Hering's reasons, pp. 535-6, also 544-6, seem to me\nambiguous), and because, even if the attention to the object does come\nfirst, it may be a mere effect of stimulus and association. Mach's\ntheory that the _will to look_ is the _space-feeling itself_ may be\ncompared with Hering's in this place. See Mach's Beitr\u00e4ge zur Analyse\nder Empfindungen (1886), pp. 55 ff.\n[380] F. H. Bradley, \"Is there a Special Activity of Attention?\" in\n'Mind,' xi, 305, and Lipps, Grundtatsachen, chaps. iv and xxx, have\nstated it similarly.\n[381] More will be said of the matter when we come to the chapter on\nthe Will.\n[382] See, for a defence of the notion of inward activity, Mr. James\nWard's searching articles in 'Mind,' xii, 45 and 564.\n[383] It must be admitted that some little time will often elapse\nbefore this effort succeeds. As a child, I slept in a nursery with a\nvery loud-ticking clock, and remember my astonishment more than once,\non listening for its tick, to find myself unable to catch it for what\nseemed a long space of time; then suddenly it would break into my\nconsciousness with an almost startling loudness.--M. Delb\u0153uf somewhere\nnarrates how, sleeping in the country near a mill-dam, he woke in the\nnight and thought the water had ceased to flow, but on looking out of\nthe open window saw it flowing in the moonlight, and then heard it too.\n[384] Zur Theorie d. sinnl. Aufmerksamkeit, p. 128 foll.\n[385] I have begun to inquire experimentally whether any of the\nmeasurable functions of the workmen change after the din of machinery\nstops at a workshop. So far I have found no constant results as regards\neither pulse, breathing, or strength of squeeze by the hand. I hope to\nprosecute the inquiry farther (May, 1890).\nCHAPTER XII.\nCONCEPTION.\nTHE SENSE OF SAMENESS.\nIn Chapter VIII, p. 221, the distinction was drawn between two kinds of\nknowledge of things, bare acquaintance with them and knowledge about\nthem. The possibility of two such knowledges depends on a fundamental\npsychical peculiarity which may be entitled \"_the principle of\nconstancy in the mind's meanings_\" and which may be thus expressed:\n\"_The same matters can be thought of in successive portions of the\nmental stream, and some of these portions can know that they mean\nthe same matters which the other portions meant._\" One might put it\notherwise by saying that \"_the mind can always intend, and know when it\nintends, to think of the Same._\"\nThis _sense of sameness_ is the very keel and backbone of our thinking.\nWe saw in Chapter X how the consciousness of personal identity reposed\non it, the present thought finding in its memories a warmth and\nintimacy which it recognizes as the same warmth and intimacy it now\nfeels. This sense of identity of the knowing subject is held by some\nphilosophers to be the only vehicle by which the world hangs together.\nIt seems hardly necessary to say that a sense of identity of the known\nobject would perform exactly the same unifying function, even if the\nsense of subjective identity were lost. And without the intention to\nthink of the same outer things over and over again, and the sense that\nwe were doing so, our sense of our own personal sameness would carry us\nbut a little way towards making a universe of our experience.\nNote, however, that we are in the first instance speaking of the sense\nof sameness from the point of view of the mind's structure alone, and\nnot from the point of view of the universe. We are psychologizing, not\nphilosophizing, That is, we do not care whether there be any _real_\nsameness in _things_ or not, or whether the mind be true or false in\nits assumptions of it. Our principle only lays it down that the mind\nmakes continual use of the _notion_ of sameness, and if deprived of\nit, would have a different structure from what it has. In a word, the\nprinciple that the mind can mean the Same is true of its _meanings_,\nbut not necessarily of aught besides.[386] The mind must conceive as\npossible that the Same should be before it, for our experience to be\nthe sort of thing it is. Without the psychological sense of identity,\nsameness might rain down upon us from the outer world for ever and we\nbe none the wiser. With the psychological sense, on the other hand,\nthe outer world might be an unbroken flux, and yet we should perceive\na repeated experience. Even now, the world may be a place in which\nthe same thing never did and never will come twice. The thing we mean\nto point at may change from top to bottom and we be ignorant of the\nfact. But in our meaning itself we are not deceived; our intention is\nto think of the same. The name which I have given to the principle,\nin calling it the law of constancy in our meanings, accentuates its\nsubjective character, and justifies us in laying it down as the most\nimportant of all the features of our mental structure.\nNot all psychic life need be assumed to have the sense of sameness\ndeveloped in this way. In the consciousness of worms and polyps,\nthough the same realities may frequently impress it, the feeling of\nsameness may seldom emerge. We, however, running back and forth, like\nspiders on the web they weave, feel ourselves to be working over\nidentical materials and thinking them in different ways. And the man\nwho identifies the materials most is held to have the most philosophic\nhuman mind.\nCONCEPTION DEFINED.\n_The function by which we thus identify a numerically distinct and\npermanent subject of discourse is called_ CONCEPTION; and the thoughts\nwhich are its vehicles are called _concepts_. But the word 'concept'\nis often used as if it stood for the object of discourse itself; and\nthis looseness feeds such evasiveness in discussion that I shall avoid\nthe use of the expression concept altogether, and speak of 'conceiving\nstate of mind,' or something similar, instead. The word 'conception'\nis unambiguous. It properly denotes neither the mental state nor what\nthe mental state signifies, but the relation between the two, namely,\nthe _function_ of the mental state in signifying just that particular\nthing. It is plain that one and the same mental state can be the\nvehicle of many conceptions, can mean a particular thing, and a great\ndeal more besides. If it has such a multiple conceptual function, it\nmay be called an act of compound conception.\nWe may conceive realities supposed to be extra-mental, as steam-engine;\nfictions, as mermaid; or mere _entia rationis_, like difference or\nnonentity. But whatever we do conceive, our conception is of that and\nnothing else--nothing else, that is, _instead_ of that, though it may\nbe of much else _in addition_ to that. Each act of conception results\nfrom our attention singling out some one part of the mass of matter\nfor thought which the world presents, and holding fast to it, without\nconfusion.[387] Confusion occurs when we do not know whether a certain\nobject proposed to us is the same with one of our meanings or not;\nso that the conceptual function requires, to be complete, that the\nthought should not only say 'I mean this,' but also say 'I don't mean\nthat.'[388]\nEach conception thus eternally remains what it is, and never can\nbecome another. The mind may change its states, and its meanings, at\ndifferent times; may drop one conception and take up another, but the\ndropped conception can in no intelligible sense be said to _change\ninto_ its successor. The paper, a moment ago white, I may now see to\nhave been scorched black. But my conception 'white' does not change\ninto my conception 'black.' On the contrary, it stays alongside of the\nobjective blackness, as a different meaning in my mind, and by so doing\nlets me judge the blackness as the paper's change. Unless it stayed, I\nshould simply say 'blackness' and know no more. Thus, amid the flux of\nopinions and of physical things, the world of conceptions, or things\nintended to be thought about, stands stiff and immutable, like Plato's\nRealm of Ideas.[389]\nSome conceptions are of things, some of events, some of qualities. Any\nfact, be it thing, event, or quality, may be conceived sufficiently\nfor purposes of identification, if only it be singled out and marked\nso as to separate it from other things. Simply calling it 'this' or\n'that' will suffice. To speak in technical language, a subject may\nbe conceived by its _denotation_, with no _connotation_, or a very\nminimum of connotation, attached. The essential point is that it should\nbe re-identified by us as that which the talk is about; and no full\nrepresentation of it is necessary for this, even when it is a fully\nrepresentable thing.\nIn this sense, creatures extremely low in the intellectual scale may\nhave conception. All that is required is that they should recognize\nthe same experience again. A polyp would be a conceptual thinker if a\nfeeling of 'Hollo! thingumbob again!' ever flitted through its mind.\nMost of the objects of our thought, however, are to some degree\nrepresented as well as merely pointed out. Either they are things\nand events perceived or imagined, or they are qualities apprehended\nin a positive way. Even where we have no intuitive acquaintance with\nthe nature of a thing, if we know any of the relations of it at all,\nanything _about_ it, that is enough to individualize and distinguish\nit from all the other things which we might mean. Many of our topics\nof discourse are thus _problematical_, or defined by their relations\nonly. We think of a thing _about_ which certain facts must obtain,\nbut we do not yet know how the thing will look when it is realized.\nThus we conceive of a perpetual-motion machine. It is a _qu\u00e6situm_\nof a perfectly definite kind,--we can always tell whether the actual\nmachines offered us do or do not agree with what we mean by it. The\nnatural possibility or impossibility of the thing does not touch the\nquestion of its conceivability in this problematic way. 'Round square,'\n'black-white-thing,' are absolutely definite conceptions; it is a mere\naccident, as far as conception goes, that they happen to stand for\nthings which nature never lets us sensibly perceive.[390]\nCONCEPTIONS ARE UNCHANGEABLE.\nThe fact that the same real topic of discourse is at one time\nconceived as a mere 'that' or 'that which, etc.,' and is at another\ntime conceived with additional specifications, has been treated by\nmany authors as a proof that conceptions themselves are fertile\nand self-developing. A conception, according to the Hegelizers in\nphilosophy, 'develops its own significance,' 'makes explicit what it\nimplicitly contained,' passes, on occasion, 'over into its opposite,'\nand in short loses altogether the blankly self-identical character we\nsupposed it to maintain. The figure we viewed as a polygon appears to\nus now as a sum of juxtaposed triangles; the number hitherto conceived\nas thirteen is at last noticed to be six plus seven, or prime; the man\nthought honest is believed a rogue. Such changes of our opinion are\nviewed by these thinkers as evolutions of our conception, from within.\nThe facts are unquestionable; our knowledge does grow and change by\nrational and inward processes, as well as by empirical discoveries.\nWhere the discoveries are empirical, no one pretends that the\npropulsive agency, the force that makes the knowledge develop, is\nmere conception. All admit it to be our continued exposure to the\n_thing_, with its power to impress our senses. Thus strychnin, which\ntastes bitter, we find will also kill, etc. Now I say that where the\nnew knowledge merely comes from _thinking_, the facts are essentially\nthe same, and that _to talk of self-development on the part of\nour conceptions is a very bad way of stating the case_. Not new\nsensations, as in the empirical instance, but new conceptions, are the\nindispensable conditions of advance.\nFor if the alleged cases of self-development be examined it will\nbe found, I believe, that the new truth affirms in every case a\n_relation_ between the original subject of conception and some new\nsubject conceived later on. These new subjects of conception arise in\nvarious ways. Every one of our conceptions is of something which our\nattention originally tore out of the continuum of felt experience,\nand provisionally isolated so as to make of it an individual topic\nof discourse. Every one of them has a way, if the mind is left alone\nwith it, of suggesting other parts of the continuum from which it was\ntorn, for conception to work upon in a similar way. This 'suggestion'\nis often no more than what we shall later know as the association\nof ideas. Often, however, it is a sort of invitation to the mind to\nplay, add lines, break number-groups, etc. Whatever it is, it brings\nnew conceptions into consciousness, which latter thereupon may or may\nnot expressly attend to the relation in which the new stands to the\nold. Thus I have a conception of equidistant lines. Suddenly, I know\nnot whence, there pops into my head the conception of their meeting.\nSuddenly again I think of the meeting and the equidistance both\ntogether, and perceive them incompatible. \"_Those_ lines will never\nmeet,\" I say. Suddenly again the word 'parallel' pops into my head.\n'They are parallels,' I continue; and so on. Original conceptions to\nstart with; adventitious conceptions pushed forward by multifarious\npsychologic causes; comparisons and combinations of the two; resultant\nconceptions to end with; which latter may be of either rational or\nempirical relations.\nAs regards these relations, they are conceptions of the second degree,\nas one might say, and their birthplace is the mind itself. In Chapter\nXXVIII I shall at considerable length defend the mind's claim to\noriginality and fertility in bringing them forth. But no single one\nof the mind's conceptions is fertile _of itself_ as the opinion which\nI criticise pretends. When the several notes of a chord are sounded\ntogether, we get a new feeling from their combination. This feeling is\ndue to the mind reacting upon that group of sounds in that determinate\nway, and no one would think of saying of any single note of the chord\nthat it 'developed' of itself into the other notes or into the feeling\nof harmony. So of Conceptions. No one of them develops into any other.\nBut if two of them are thought at once, their _relation_ may come to\nconsciousness, and form matter for a third conception.\nTake 'thirteen' for example, which is said to develop into 'prime.'\nWhat really happens is that we compare the utterly changeless\nconception of thirteen with various other conceptions, those of the\ndifferent multiples of two, three, four, five, and six, and ascertain\nthat it _differs_ from them all. Such difference is a freshly\nascertained relation. It is only for mere brevity's sake that we call\nit a property of the original thirteen, the property of being prime.\nWe shall see in the next chapter that (if we count out \u00e6sthetic and\nmoral relations between things) the only important relations of which\nthe mere inspection of conceptions makes us aware are relations of\ncomparison, that is, of difference and no-difference, between them. The\njudgment 6 + 7 = 13 expresses the relation of _equality_ between two\nideal objects, 13 on the one hand and 6 + 7 on the other, successively\nconceived and compared. The judgments 6 + 7 > 12, or 6 + 7 < 14,\nexpress in like manner relations of inequality between ideal objects.\nBut if it be unfair to say that the conception of 6 + 7 generates that\nof 12 or of 14, surely it is as unfair to say that it generates that of\n13.\nThe conceptions of 12, 13, and 14 are each and all generated by\nindividual acts of the mind, playing with its materials. When,\ncomparing two ideal objects, we find them equal, the conception of one\nof them may be that of a whole and of the other that of all its parts.\nThis particular case is, it seems to me, the only case which makes\nthe notion of one conception evolving into another sound plausible.\nBut even in this case the conception, as such, of the whole does not\nevolve into the conception, as such, of the parts. Let the conception\nof some object as a whole be given first. To begin with, it points\nto and identifies for future thought a certain _that_. The 'whole'\nin question might be one of those mechanical puzzles of which the\ndifficulty is to unlock the parts. In this case, nobody would pretend\nthat the richer and more elaborate conception which we gain of the\npuzzle after solving it came directly out of our first crude conception\nof it, for it is notoriously the outcome of experimenting with our\nhands. It is true that, as they both mean _that same puzzle_, our\nearlier thought and our later thought have one conceptual function, are\nvehicles of one conception. But in addition to being the vehicle of\nthis bald unchanging conception, 'that same puzzle,' the later thought\nis the vehicle of all those other conceptions which it took the manual\nexperimentation to acquire. Now, it is just the same where the whole\nis mathematical instead of being mechanical. Let it be a polygonal\nspace, which we cut into triangles, and of which we then affirm that\nit _is_ those triangles. Here the experimentation (although usually\ndone by a pencil in the hands) may be done by the unaided imagination.\nWe hold the space, first conceived as polygonal simply, in our mind's\neye until our attention wandering to and fro within it has carved it\ninto the triangles. The triangles are a new conception, the result of\nthis new operation. Having once conceived them, however, and compared\nthem with the old polygon which we originally conceived and which we\nhave never ceased conceiving, we judge them to fit exactly into its\narea. The earlier and later conceptions, we say, are of one and the\nsame space. But this relation between triangles and polygon which the\nmind cannot help finding if it compares them at all, is very badly\nexpressed by saying that the old conception has developed into the new.\nNew conceptions come from new sensations, new movements, new emotions,\nnew associations, new acts of attention, and new comparisons of old\nconceptions, and not in other ways. Endogenous prolification is not a\nmode of growth to which conceptions can lay claim.\nI hope, therefore, that I shall not be accused of huddling mysteries\nout of sight, when I insist that the psychology of conception is\nnot the place in which to treat of those of continuity and change.\nConceptions form the one class of entities that cannot under any\ncircumstances change. They can cease to be, altogether; or they can\nstay, as what they severally are; but there is for them no middle\nway. They form an essentially discontinuous system, and translate the\nprocess of our perceptual experience, which is naturally a flux, into a\nset of stagnant and petrified terms. The very conception of flux itself\nis an absolutely changeless meaning in the mind: it signifies just that\none thing, flux, immovably.--And, with this, the doctrine of the flux\nof the concept may be dismissed, and need not occupy our attention\nagain.[391]\n'ABSTRACT' IDEAS.\nWe have now to pass to a less excusable mistake. There are philosophers\nwho deny that associated things can be broken asunder at all, even\nprovisionally, by the conceiving mind. The opinion known as Nominalism\nsays that we really never frame any conception of the partial elements\nof an experience, but are compelled, whenever we think it, to think it\nin its totality, just as it came.\nI will be silent of medi\u00e6val Nominalism, and begin with Berkeley,\nwho is supposed to have rediscovered the doctrine for himself. His\nasseverations against 'abstract ideas' are among the oftenest quoted\npassages in philosophic literature.\n\"It is agreed,\" he says, \"on all hands that the qualities or modes\nof things do never really exist each of them apart by itself, and\nseparated from all others, but are mixed, as it were, and blended\ntogether, several in the same object. But, we are told, the mind being\nable to consider each quality singly, or abstracted from those other\nqualities with which it is united, does by that means frame to itself\nabstract ideas.... After this manner, it is said, we come by the\nabstract idea of man, or, if you please, humanity, or human nature;\nwherein it is true there is included color, because there is no man\nbut has some color, but then it can be neither white, nor black, nor\nany particular color, because there is no one particular color wherein\nall men partake. So likewise there is included stature, but then it\nis neither tall stature nor low stature, nor yet middle stature, but\nsomething abstracted from all these. And so of the rest.... Whether\nothers have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas, they\nbest can tell: for myself, I find indeed I have a faculty of imagining\nor representing to myself the ideas of those particular things I have\nperceived and of variously compounding and dividing them.... I can\nconsider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself abstracted or\nseparated from the rest of the body. But then, whatever hand or eye\nI imagine, it must have some particular shape and color. Likewise\nthe idea of man that I frame to myself must be either of a white, or\na black, or a tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or\na middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive the\nabstract idea above described. And it is equally impossible for me to\nform the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving, and\nwhich is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear; and the\nlike may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever....\nAnd there is ground to think most men will acknowledge themselves to\nbe in my case. The generality of men which are simple and illiterate\nnever pretend to abstract notions. It is said they are difficult, and\nnot to be attained without pains and study.\n\"Now I would fain know at what time it is men are employed in\nsurmounting that difficulty, and furnishing themselves with those\nnecessary helps for discourse. It cannot be when they are grown up,\nfor then it seems they are not conscious of any such painstaking; it\nremains therefore to be the business of their childhood. And surely\nthe great and multiplied labor of framing abstract notions will be\nfound a hard task for that tender age. Is it not a hard thing to\nimagine that a couple of children cannot prate together of their\nsugar-plums and rattles and the rest of their little trinkets, till\nthey have first tacked together numberless inconsistencies, and so\nframed in their minds abstract general ideas, and annexed them to\nevery common name they make use of?\"[392]\nThe note, so bravely struck by Berkeley, could not, however, be well\nsustained in face of the fact patent to every human being that we\n_can_ mean color without meaning any particular color, and stature\nwithout meaning any particular height. James Mill, to be sure, chimes\nin heroically in the chapter on Classification of his 'Analysis'; but\nin his son John the nominalistic voice has grown so weak that, although\n'abstract ideas' are repudiated as a matter of traditional form, the\nopinions uttered are really nothing but a conceptualism ashamed to call\nitself by its own legitimate name.[393] Conceptualism says the mind can\nconceive any quality or relation it pleases, and mean nothing but it,\nin isolation from everything else in the world. This is, of course, the\ndoctrine which we have professed. John Mill says:\n\"The formation of a Concept does not consist in separating the\nattributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes\nof the same object, and enabling us to conceive those attributes,\ndisjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think\nthem, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as\nforming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an\nindividual object. But, though meaning them only as part of a larger\nagglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to\nthe neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined.\n_While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently\nintense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other\nattributes, and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing-present\nto our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept_.... General\nconcepts, therefore, we have, properly speaking, none; we have only\ncomplex ideas of objects in the concrete: but we are able to _attend\nexclusively to certain parts_ of the concrete idea: and by that\n_exclusive attention_ we enable those parts to _determine exclusively\nthe course of our thoughts_ as subsequently called up by association;\nand are in a condition to carry on a train of meditation or reasoning\nrelating to those parts only, _exactly as if_ we were able to\n_conceive_ them separately from the rest.\"[394]\nThis is a lovely example of Mill's way of holding piously to his\ngeneral statements, but conceding in detail all that their adversaries\nask. If there be a better description extant, of a mind in possession\nof an 'abstract idea,' than is contained in the words I have\nitalicized, I am unacquainted with it. The Berkeleyan nominalism thus\nbreaks down.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt is easy to lay bare the false assumption which underlies the whole\ndiscussion of the question as hitherto carried on. That assumption is\nthat ideas, in order to know, must be cast in the exact likeness of\nwhatever things they know, and that the only things that can be known\nare those which ideas can resemble. The error has not been confined\nto nominalists. _Omnis cognitio fit per assimilationem cognoscentis\net cogniti_ has been the maxim, more or less explicitly assumed, of\nwriters of every school. Practically it amounts to saying that an idea\nmust _be_ a duplicate edition of what it knows[395]--in other words,\nthat it can only know itself--or, more shortly still, that knowledge\nin any strict sense of the word, as a self-transcendent function, is\nimpossible.\nNow our own blunt statements about the ultimateness of the cognitive\nrelation, and the difference between the 'object' of the thought and\nits mere 'topic' or 'subject of discourse' (cf. pp. 275 ff.), are all\nat variance with any such theory; and we shall find more and more\noccasion, as we advance in this book, to deny its general truth. All\nthat a state of mind need do, in order to take cognizance of a reality,\nintend it, or be 'about' it, is to lead to a remoter state of mind\nwhich either acts upon the reality or resembles it. The only class of\nthoughts which can with any show of plausibility be said to resemble\ntheir objects are sensations. The stuff of which all our other thoughts\nare composed is symbolic, and a thought attests its pertinency to a\ntopic by simply _terminating_, sooner or later, in a sensation which\nresembles the latter.\nBut Mill and the rest believe that a thought must _be_ what it means,\nand mean what it _is_, and that if it be a picture of an entire\nindividual, it cannot mean any part of him to the exclusion of the\nrest. I say nothing here of the preposterously false descriptive\npsychology involved in the statement that the only things we can\nmentally picture are individuals completely determinate in all\nregards. Chapter XVIII will have something to say on that point, and\nwe can ignore it here. For even if it were true that our images were\nalways of concrete individuals, it would not in the least follow that\nour meanings were of the same.\n_The sense of our meaning is an entirely peculiar element of the\nthought._ It is one of those evanescent and 'transitive' facts of mind\nwhich introspection cannot turn round upon, and isolate and hold up\nfor examination, as an entomologist passes round an insect on a pin.\nIn the (somewhat clumsy) terminology I have used, it pertains to the\n'fringe' of the subjective state, and is a 'feeling of tendency,' whose\nneural counterpart is undoubtedly a lot of dawning and dying processes\ntoo faint and complex to be traced. The geometer, with his one definite\nfigure before him, knows perfectly that his thoughts apply to countless\nother figures as well, and that although he _sees_ lines of a certain\nspecial bigness, direction, color, etc., he _means_ not one of these\ndetails. When I use the word _man_ in two different sentences, I may\nhave both times exactly the same sound upon my lips and the same\npicture in my mental eye, but I may mean, and at the very moment of\nuttering the word and imagining the picture, know that I mean, two\nentirely different things. Thus when I say: \"What a wonderful man\nJones is!\" I am perfectly aware that I mean by man to exclude Napoleon\nBonaparte or Smith. But when I say: \"What a wonderful thing Man is!\"\nI am equally well aware that I mean to _in_clude not only Jones, but\nNapoleon and Smith as well. This added consciousness is an absolutely\npositive sort of feeling, transforming what would otherwise be mere\nnoise or vision into something _understood_; and determining the sequel\nof my thinking, the later words and images, in a perfectly definite\nway. We saw in Chapter IX that the image _per se_, the nucleus, is\n_functionally_ the least important part of the thought. _Our doctrine,\ntherefore, of the 'fringe' leads to a perfectly satisfactory decision\nof the nominalistic and conceptualistic controversy,_ so far as it\ntouches psychology. _We must decide in favor of the conceptualists,_\nand affirm that the power to think things, qualities, relations, or\nwhatever other elements there may be, isolated and abstracted from\nthe total experience in which they appear, is the most indisputable\nfunction of our thought.\nUNIVERSALS.\nAfter abstractions, universals! The 'fringe,' which lets us believe in\nthe one, lets us believe in the other too. An individual conception\nis of something restricted, in its application, to a single case. A\nuniversal or general conception is of an entire class, or of something\nbelonging to an entire class, of things. The conception of an abstract\nquality is, taken by itself, neither universal nor particular.[396] If\nI abstract _white_ from the rest of the wintry landscape this morning,\nit is a perfectly definite conception, a self-identical quality which I\nmay mean again; but, as I have not yet individualized it by expressly\nmeaning to restrict it to this particular snow, nor thought at all of\nthe possibility of other things to which it may be applicable, it is\nso far nothing but a 'that,' a 'floating adjective,' as Mr. Bradley\ncalls it, or a topic broken out from the rest of the world. Properly\nit is, in this state, a singular--I have 'singled it out;' and when,\nlater, I universalize or individualize its application, and my thought\nturns to mean either _this_ white or _all possible_ whites, I am in\nreality meaning two new things and forming two new conceptions.[397]\nSuch an alteration of my meaning has nothing to do with any change\nin the image I may have in my mental eye, but solely with the vague\nconsciousness that surrounds the image, of the sphere to which it is\nintended to apply. We can give no more definite account of this vague\nconsciousness than has been given on pp. 249-266. But that is no\nreason for denying its presence.[398]\nBut the nominalists and traditional conceptualists find matter for an\ninveterate quarrel in these simple facts. Full of their notion that\nan idea, feeling, or state of consciousness can at bottom only be\naware of its own quality; and agreeing, as they both do, that such an\nidea or state of consciousness is a perfectly determinate, singular,\nand transitory thing; they find it impossible to conceive how it\nshould become the vehicle of a knowledge of anything permanent or\nuniversal. \"To know a universal, it must be universal; for like can\nonly be known by like,\" etc. Unable to reconcile these incompatibles,\nthe knower and the known, each side immolates one of them to save the\nother. The nominalists 'settle the hash' of the thing known by denying\nit to be ever a genuine universal; the conceptualists despatch the\nknower by denying it to be a state of mind, in the sense of being\na perishing segment of thoughts' stream, consubstantial with other\nfacts of sensibility. They invent, instead of it, as the vehicle of\nthe knowledge of universals, an _actus purus intellectus_, or an Ego,\nwhose function is treated as quasi-miraculous and nothing if not\nawe-inspiring, and which it is a sort of blasphemy to approach with the\nintent to explain and make common, or reduce to lower terms. Invoked\nin the first instance as a vehicle for the knowledge of universals,\nthe higher principle presently is made the indispensable vehicle of\nall thinking whatever, for, it is contended, \"a universal element is\npresent in every thought.\" The nominalists meanwhile, who dislike\n_actus purus_ and awe-inspiring principles and despise the reverential\nmood, content themselves with saying that we are mistaken in supposing\nwe ever get sight of the face of an universal; and that what deludes us\nis nothing but the swarm of 'individual ideas' which may at any time be\nawakened by the hearing of a name.\nIf we open the pages of either school, we find it impossible to tell,\nin all the whirl about universal and particular, when the author\nis talking about universals in the mind, and when about objective\nuniversals, so strangely are the two mixed together. James Ferrier, for\nexample, is the most brilliant of anti-nominalist writers. But who is\nnimble-witted enough to count, in the following sentences from him, the\nnumber of times he steps from the known to the knower, and attributes\nto both whatever properties he finds in either one?\n\"To think is to pass from the singular or particular to the idea\n[concept] or universal.... Ideas are necessary because no thinking\ncan take place without them. They are universal, inasmuch as they\nare completely divested of the particularity which characterizes\nall the phenomena of mere sensation. To grasp the nature of this\nuniversality is not easy. Perhaps the best means by which this end\nmay be compassed is by contrasting it with the particular. It is not\ndifficult to understand that a sensation, a phenomenon of sense, is\nnever more than the particular which it is. As such, that is, in its\nstrict particularity, it is absolutely unthinkable. In the very act\nof being thought, something more than it emerges, and this something\nmore cannot be again the particular.... Ten particulars _per se_\ncannot be thought of any more than one particular can be thought\nof;... there always emerges in thought an additional something, which\nis the possibility of other particulars to an indefinite extent....\nThe indefinite additional something which they are instances of is a\nuniversal.... The idea or universal cannot possibly be pictured in the\nimagination, for this would at once reduce it to the particular....\nThis inability to form any sort of picture or representation of\nan idea does not proceed from any imperfection or limitation of\nour faculties, but is a quality inherent in the very nature of\nintelligence. A contradiction is involved in the supposition that an\nidea or a universal can become the object either of sense or of the\nimagination. An idea is thus diametrically opposed to an image.\"[399]\nThe nominalists, on their side, admit a _quasi_-universal, something\nwhich we think _as if it were_ universal, though it is not; and in\nall that they say about this something, which they explain to be 'an\nindefinite number of particular ideas,' the same vacillation between\nthe subjective and the objective points of view appears. The reader\nnever can tell whether an 'idea' spoken of is supposed to be a knower\nor a known. The authors themselves do not distinguish. They want to get\nsomething in the mind which shall _resemble_ what is out of the mind,\nhowever vaguely, and they think that when that fact is accomplished, no\nfarther questions will be asked. James Mill writes:[400]\n\"The word, man, we shall say, is first applied to an individual; it\nis first associated with the idea of that individual, and acquires\nthe power of calling up the idea of him; it is next applied to\nanother individual and acquires the power of calling up the idea of\nhim; so of another and another, till it has become associated with\nan indefinite number, and has acquired the power of calling up an\nindefinite number of those ideas indifferently. What happens? It\ndoes call up an indefinite number of the ideas of individuals as\noften as it occurs; and calling them in close connection, it forms\na species of complex idea of them.... It is also a fact, that when\nan idea becomes to a certain extent complex, from the multiplicity\nof the ideas it _comprehends_, it is of necessity indistinct;... and\nthis indistinctness has, doubtless, been a main cause of the mystery\nwhich has appeared to belong to it.... It thus appears that the word\n_man_ is not a word having a very simple idea, as was the opinion of\nthe realists; nor a word having no idea at all, as was that of the\n[earlier] nominalists; but a word calling up an indefinite number of\nideas, by the irresistible laws of association, and forming them into\none very complex and indistinct, but not therefore unintelligible,\nidea.\"\nBerkeley had already said:[401]\n\"A word becomes general by being made the sign, not of an abstract\ngeneral idea, but of many several particular ideas, any one of which\nit indifferently suggests to the mind. An idea which, considered in\nitself, is particular, becomes general by being made to represent or\nstand for all other particular ideas of the same sort.\"\n'Stand for,' not _know_; 'becomes general,' not becomes _aware\nof something_ general; 'particular ideas,' not particular\n_things_--everywhere the same timidity about begging the fact of\nknowing, and the pitifully impotent attempt to foist it in the shape\nof a mode of _being_ of 'ideas.' If the fact to be conceived be the\nindefinitely numerous actual and possible members of a class, then it\nis assumed that if we can only get enough ideas to huddle together\nfor a moment in the mind, the _being_ of each several one of them\nthere will be an equivalent for the _knowing_, or _meaning_, of _one_\nmember of the class in question; and their number will be so large as\nto confuse our tally and leave it doubtful whether all the possible\nmembers of the class have thus been satisfactorily told off or not.\nOf course this is nonsense. An idea neither is what it knows, nor knows\nwhat it is; nor will swarms of copies of the same 'idea,' recurring in\nstereotyped form, or 'by the irresistible laws of association formed\ninto one idea,' ever be the same thing as a thought of '_all the\npossible members_' of a class. We must mean _that_ by an altogether\nspecial bit of consciousness _ad hoc_. But it is easy to translate\nBerkeley's, Hume's, and Mill's notion of a swarm of ideas into cerebral\nterms, and so to make them stand for something real; and, in this\nsense, I think the doctrine of these authors less hollow than the\nopposite one which makes the vehicle of universal conceptions to be\nan _actus purus_ of the soul. If each 'idea' stand for some special\nnascent nerve-process, then the aggregate of these nascent processes\nmight have for its conscious correlate a psychic 'fringe,' which should\nbe just that universal meaning, or intention that the name or mental\npicture employed should mean all the possible individuals of the class.\nEvery peculiar complication of brain-processes must have some peculiar\ncorrelate in the soul. To one set of processes will correspond the\nthought of an indefinite taking of the extent of a word like _man_;\nto another set that of a particular taking; and to a third set that\nof a universal taking, of the extent of the same word. The thought\ncorresponding to either set of processes, is always itself a unique and\nsingular event, whose dependence on its peculiar nerve-process I of\ncourse am far from professing to explain.[402]\nTruly in comparison with the fact that every conception, whatever\nit be of, is one of the mind's immutable possessions, the question\nwhether a single thing, or a whole class of things, or only an\nunassigned quality, be meant by it, is an insignificant matter of\ndetail. Our meanings are of singulars, particulars, indefinites, and\nuniversals, mixed together in every way. A singular individual is as\nmuch _conceived_ when he is isolated and identified away from the\nrest of the world in my mind, as is the most rarefied and universally\napplicable quality he may possess--_being_, for example, when treated\nin the same way.[403] From every point of view, the overwhelming and\nportentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising.\nWhy, from Plato and Aristotle downwards, philosophers should have vied\nwith each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular, and in\nadoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that\nthe more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable\nthings, and that the _things_ of worth are all concretes and singulars.\nThe only value of universal characters is that they help us, by\nreasoning, to know new truths about individual things. The restriction\nof one's meaning, moreover, to an individual thing, probably requires\neven more complicated brain-processes than its extension to all the\ninstances of a kind; and the mere mystery, as such, of the knowledge,\nis equally great, whether generals or singulars be the things known. In\nsum, therefore, the traditional universal-worship can only be called a\nbit of perverse sentimentalism, a philosophic 'idol of the cave.'\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt may seem hardly necessary to add (what follows as a matter of\ncourse from pp. 229-237, and what has been implied in our assertions\nall along) that _nothing can be conceived twice over without being\nconceived in entirely different states of mind_. Thus, my arm-chair is\none of the things of which I have a conception; I knew it yesterday\nand recognized it when I looked at it. But if I think of it to-day as\nthe same arm-chair which I looked at yesterday, it is obvious that\nthe very conception of it as the same is an additional complication\nto the thought, whose inward constitution must alter in consequence.\nIn short, it is logically impossible that the same thing should be\n_known as the same_ by two successive copies of the same thought. As\na matter of fact, the thoughts by which we know that we mean the same\nthing are apt to be very different indeed from each other. We think\nthe thing now in one context, now in another; now in a definite image,\nnow in a symbol. Sometimes our sense of its identity pertains to the\nmere fringe, sometimes it involves the nucleus, of our thought. We\nnever can break the thought asunder and tell just which one of its\nbits is the part that lets us know which subject is referred to; but\nnevertheless we always _do_ know which of all possible subjects we have\nin mind. Introspective psychology must here throw up the sponge; the\nfluctuations of subjective life are too exquisite to be arrested by its\ncoarse means. It must confine itself to bearing witness to the fact\nthat all sorts of different subjective states do form the vehicle by\nwhich the same is known; and it must contradict the opposite view.\nThe ordinary Psychology of 'ideas' constantly talks as if the vehicle\nof the same thing-known must be the same recurrent state of mind,\nand as if the having over again of the same 'idea' were not only a\nnecessary but a sufficient condition for meaning the same thing twice.\nBut this recurrence of the same idea would utterly defeat the existence\nof a repeated knowledge of anything. It would be a simple reversion\ninto a pre-existent state, with nothing gained in the interval, and\nwith complete unconsciousness of the state having existed before. Such\nis not the way in which we think. As a rule we are fully aware that\nwe have thought before of the thing we think of now. The continuity\nand permanency of the topic is of the essence of our intellection.\nWe recognize the old problem, and the old solutions; and we go on to\nalter and improve and substitute one predicate for another without ever\nletting the subject change.\nThis is what is meant when it is said that thinking consists in making\n_judgments_. A succession of judgments may all be about the same thing.\nThe general practical postulate which encourages us to keep thinking\nat all is that by going on to do so we shall judge better _of the same\nthings_ than if we do not.[404] In the successive judgments, all sorts\nof new operations are performed on the things, and all sorts of new\nresults brought out, without the sense of the main topic ever getting\nlost. At the outset, we merely _have_ the topic; then we _operate_ on\nit; and finally we have it again in a richer and truer way. A compound\nconception has been substituted for the simple one, but with full\nconsciousness that both are of the Same.\nThe distinction between having and operating is as natural in the\nmental as in the material world. As our hands may hold a bit of wood\nand a knife, and yet do naught with either; so our mind may simply\nbe aware of a thing's existence, and yet neither attend to it nor\ndiscriminate it, neither locate nor count nor compare nor like nor\ndislike nor deduce it, nor recognize it articulately as having been\nmet with before. At the same time we know that, instead of staring at\nit in this entranced and senseless way, we may rally our activity in\na moment, and locate, class, compare, count, and judge it. There is\nnothing involved in all this which we did not postulate at the very\noutset of our introspective work: realities, namely, _extra mentem_,\nthoughts, and possible relations of cognition between the two. The\nresult of the thoughts' operating on the data given to sense is to\ntransform the order in which experience _comes_ into an entirely\ndifferent order, that of the _conceived_ world. There is no spot of\nlight, for example, which I pick out and proceed to define as a pebble,\nwhich is not thereby torn from its mere time- and space-neighbors,\nand thought in conjunction with things physically parted from it by\nthe width of nature. Compare the form in which facts appear in a\ntext-book of physics, as logically subordinated laws, with that in\nwhich we naturally make their acquaintance. The conceptual scheme is\na sort of sieve in which we try to gather up the world's contents.\nMost facts and relations fall through its meshes, being either too\nsubtle or insignificant to be fixed in any conception. But whenever a\nphysical reality is caught and identified as the same with something\nalready conceived, it remains on the sieve, and all the predicates\nand relations of the conception with which it is identified become\nits predicates and relations too; it is subjected to the sieve's\nnetwork, in other words. Thus comes to pass what Mr. Hodgson calls\nthe translation of the perceptual into the conceptual order of the\nworld.[405] In Chapter XXII we shall see how this translation always\ntakes place for the sake of some subjective _interest_, and how the\nconception with which we handle a bit of sensible experience is\nreally nothing but a teleological instrument. _This whole function\nof conceiving, of fixing, and holding fast to meanings, has no\nsignificance apart from the fact that the conceiver is a creature with\npartial purposes and private ends._ There remains, therefore, much more\nto be said about conception, but for the present this will suffice.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[386] There are two other 'principles of identity' in philosophy.\nThe _ontological_ one asserts that every real thing is what it is,\nthat _a_ is _a_, and _b, b_. The _logical_ one says that what is once\ntrue of the subject of a judgment is always true of that subject.\nThe ontological law is a tautological truism; the logical principle\nis already more, for it implies subjects unalterable by time. The\n_psychological_ law also implies facts which might not be realized:\nthere might be no succession of thoughts; or if there were, the later\nones might not think of the earlier; or if they did, they might not\nrecall the content thereof; or, recalling the content, they might not\ntake it as 'the same' with anything else.\n[387] In later chapters we shall see that determinate relations exist\nbetween the various data thus fixed upon by the mind. These are called\n_a priori_ or axiomatic relations. Simple inspection of the data\nenables us to perceive them; and one inspection is as effective as\na million for engendering in us the conviction that between _those_\ndata that relation must always hold. To change the relation we should\nhave to make the data different. 'The guarantee for the uniformity\nand adequacy' of the data can only be the mind's own power to fix\nupon any objective content, and to mean that content as often as it\nlikes. This right of the mind to 'construct' permanent ideal objects\nfor itself out of the data of experience seems, singularly enough,\nto be a stumbling-block to many. Professor Robertson in his clear\nand instructive article 'Axioms' in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (9th\nedition) suggests that it may only be where _movements_ enter into the\nconstitution of the ideal object (as they do in geometrical figures)\nthat we can \"_make_ the ultimate relations to be what for us they\nmust be in all circumstances.\" He makes, it is true, a concession\nin favor of conceptions of number abstracted from \"subjective\noccurrences succeeding each other in time\" because these also are\nacts \"of construction, dependent on the power we have of voluntarily\ndetermining the flow of subjective consciousness.\" \"The content of\npassive sensation,\" on the other hand, \"may indefinitely vary beyond\nany control of ours.\" What if it do vary, so long as we can continue\nto think of and mean the qualities it varied from? We can 'make' ideal\nobjects for ourselves out of irrecoverable bits of passive experience\nquite as perfectly as out of easily repeatable active experiences. And\nwhen we have got our objects together and compared them, we do not\n_make_, but _find_, their relations.\n[388] Cf. Hodgson, Time and Space, \u00a7 46. Lotze, Logic, \u00a7 11.\n[389] \"For though a man in a fever should from sugar have a bitter\ntaste which at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of\nbitter in that man's mind would be as distinct as if he had tasted only\ngall.\" (Locke's Essay bk. ii, chap. xi, \u00a7 3. Read the whole section!)\n[390] Black round things, square white things, _per contra_, Nature\ngives us freely enough. But the combinations which she refuses to\nrealize may exist as distinctly, in the shape of postulates, as\nthose which she gives may exist in the shape of positive images, in\nour mind. As a matter of fact, she _may_ realize a warm cold thing\nwhenever two points of the skin, so near together as not to be locally\ndistinguished, are touched, the one with a warm, the other with a cold,\npiece of metal. The warmth and the cold are then often felt as if in\nthe same objective place. Under similar conditions two objects, one\nsharp and the other blunt, may feel like one sharp blunt thing. The\nsame space may appear of two colors if, by optical artifice, one of the\ncolors is made to appear as if seen _through_ the other.--Whether any\ntwo attributes whatever shall be compatible or not, in the sense of\nappearing or not to occupy the same place and moment, depends simply\non _de facto_ peculiarities of natural bodies and of our sense-organs.\n_Logically_, anyone combination of qualities is to the full as\n_conceivable_ as any other, and has as distinct a meaning for thought.\nWhat necessitates this remark is the confusion deliberately kept up\nby certain authors (e.g. Spencer, Psychology, \u00a7\u00a7 420-7) between the\ninconceivable and the not-distinctly-imaginable. How do we know _which_\nthings we cannot imagine unless by first conceiving them, meaning\n_them_ and not other things?\n[391] Arguments seldom make converts in matters philosophical; and\nsome readers, I know, who find that they conceive a certain matter\ndifferently from what they did, will still prefer saying they have two\ndifferent editions of the same conception, one evolved from the other,\nto saying they have two different conceptions of the same thing. It\ndepends, after all, on how we define conception. We ourselves defined\nit as the function by which a state of mind means to think the same\nwhereof it thought on a former occasion. Two states of mind will\naccordingly be two editions of the same conception just so far as\neither does mean to think what the other thought; but no farther. If\neither mean to think what the other did not think, it is a different\nconception from the other. And if either mean to think all that the\nother thought, _and more_, it is a different conception, so far as the\n_more_ goes. In this last case one state of mind has two conceptual\nfunctions. Each thought decides, by its own authority, which, out of\nall the conceptive functions open to it, it shall now renew; with\nwhich other thought it shall identify itself as a conceiver, and just\nhow far. \"The same A which I once meant,\" it says, \"I shall now mean\nagain, and mean it with C as its predicate (or what not) instead of B,\nas before.\" In all this, therefore, there is absolutely no changing,\nbut only uncoupling and recoupling of conceptions. Compound conceptions\ncome, as functions of new states of mind. Some of these functions are\nthe same with previous ones, some not. Any changed opinion, then,\n_partly_ contains new editions (absolutely identical with the old,\nhowever) of former conceptions, _partly_ absolutely new conceptions.\nThe division is a perfectly easy one to make in each particular case.\n[392] Principles of Human Knowledge, Introduction, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 14.\n[393] 'Conceptualisme honteux,' Rabier, Psychologie, 310.\n[394] Exam. of Hamilton, p. 393.

Even modern and independent authors like\nProf. Dewey (Psychology, 207) obey the tradition: \"The mind seizes\nupon some one aspect,... abstracts or prescinds it. This very seizure\nof some one element generalizes the one abstracted.... Attention, in\ndrawing it forth, makes it a distinct content of consciousness, and\nthus universalizes it; it is considered no longer in its particular\nconnection with the object, but on its own account; that is, as an\nidea, or what it signifies to the mind; and significance is always\nuniversal.\"\n[397] C. F. Reid's Intellectual Powers, Essay v, chap.\niii.--_Whiteness_ is one thing, _the whiteness of this sheet of paper_\nanother thing.\n[398] Mr. F. H. Bradley says the conception or the 'meaning' \"consists\nof a part of the content, cut off, fixed by the mind, and considered\napart from the existence of the sign. It would not be correct to add,\nand referred away to another real subject; for where we think without\njudging, and where we deny, that description would not be applicable.\"\nThis seems to be the same doctrine as ours; the application to one or\nto all subjects of the abstract fact conceived (i.e. its individuality\nor its universality), constituting a new conception. I am, however,\nnot quite sure that Mr. Bradley steadily maintains this ground. Cf.\nthe first chapter of his Principles of Logic. The doctrine I defend\nis stoutly upheld in Rosmini's Philosophical System, Introduction by\nThomas Davidson, p. 43 (London, 1882).\n[399] Lectures on Greek Philosophy, pp. 33-39.\n[400] Analysis, chap. viii.\n[401] Principles of Human Knowledge, Introduction, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12.\n[402] It may add to the effect of the text to quote a passage from the\nessay in 'Mind,' referred to on p. 224.\n\"Why may we not side with the conceptualists in saying that the\nuniversal sense of a word does correspond to a mental fact of _some_\nkind, but at the same time, agreeing with the nominalists that all\nmental facts are modifications of subjective sensibility, why may we\nnot call that fact a 'feeling'? _Man_ meant for _mankind_ is in short\na different feeling from _man_ as a mere noise, or from _man_ meant\nfor _that_ man, to wit, John Smith alone. Not that the difference\nconsists simply in the fact that, when taken universally, the word\nhas one of Mr. Galton's 'blended' images of man associated with it.\nMany persons have seemed to think that these blended or, as Prof.\nHuxley calls them, 'generic' images are equivalent to concepts. But,\nin itself, a blurred thing is just as particular as a sharp thing; and\nthe generic character of either sharp image or blurred image depends on\nits being felt _with its representative function_. This function is the\nmysterious _plus_, the understood meaning. But it is nothing applied to\nthe image from above, no pure act of reason inhabiting a supersensible\nand semi-supernatural plane. It can be diagrammatized as continuous\nwith all the other segments of the subjective stream. It is just that\nstaining, fringe, or halo of obscurely felt relation to masses of other\nimagery about to come, but not yet distinctly in focus, which we have\nso abundantly set forth [in Chapter IX].\n\"If the image come unfringed, it reveals but a simple quality, thing,\nor event; if it come fringed, it may reveal something expressly taken\nuniversally or in a scheme of relations. The difference between thought\nand feeling thus reduces itself, in the last subjective analysis, to\nthe presence or absence of 'fringe.' And this in turn reduces itself,\nwith much probability, in the last physiological analysis, to the\nabsence or presence of sub-excitements in other convolutions of the\nbrain than those whose discharges underlie the more definite nucleus,\nthe substantive ingredient, of the thought,--in this instance, the word\nor image it may happen to arouse.\n\"The contrast is not, then, as the Platonists would have it, between\ncertain subjective facts called images and sensations, and others\ncalled acts of relating intelligence; the former being blind perishing\nthings, knowing not even their own existence as such, whilst the latter\ncombine the poles in the mysterious synthesis of their cognitive sweep.\nThe contrast is really between two _aspects_, in which all mental\nfacts without exception may be taken; their structural aspect, as\nbeing subjective, and their functional aspect, as being cognitions.\nIn the former aspect, the highest as well as the lowest is a feeling,\na peculiarly tinged segment of the stream. This tingeing is its\nsensitive body, the _wie ihm zu Muthe ist_, the way it feels whilst\npassing. In the latter aspect, the lowest mental fact as well as the\nhighest may grasp some bit of truth as its content, even though that\ntruth were as relationless a matter as a bare unlocalized and undated\nquality of pain. From the cognitive point of view, all mental facts\nare intellections. From the subjective point of view all are feelings.\nOnce admit that the passing and evanescent are as real parts of the\nstream as the distinct and comparatively abiding; once allow that\nfringes and halos, inarticulate perceptions, whereof the objects are as\nyet unnamed, mere nascencies of cognition, premonitions, awarenesses\nof direction, are thoughts _sui generis_, as much as articulate\nimaginings and propositions are; once restore, I say, the _vague_ to\nits psychological rights, and the matter presents no further difficulty.\n\"And then we see that the current opposition of Feeling to Knowledge\nis quite a false issue. If every feeling is at the same time a bit\nof knowledge, we ought no longer to talk of mental states differing\nby having more or less of the cognitive quality; they only differ in\nknowing more or less, in having much fact or little fact for their\nobject. The feeling of a broad scheme of relations is a feeling that\nknows much; the feeling of a simple quality is a feeling that knows\nlittle. But the knowing itself, whether of much or of little, has the\nsame essence, and is as good knowing in the one case as in the other.\nConcept and image, thus discriminated through their objects, are\nconsubstantial in their inward nature, as modes of feeling. The one,\nas particular, will no longer be held to be a relatively base sort\nof entity, to be taken as a matter of course, whilst the other, as\nuniversal, is celebrated as a sort of standing miracle, to be adored\nbut not explained. Both concept and image, _qu\u00e2_ subjective, are\nsingular and particular. Both are moments of the stream, which come\nand in an instant are no more. The word universality has no meaning as\napplied to their psychic body or structure, which is always finite. It\nonly has a meaning when applied to their use, import, or reference to\nthe kind of object they may reveal. The representation, as such, of\nthe universal object is as particular as that of an object about which\nwe know so little that the interjection 'Ha!' is all it can evoke from\nus in the way of speech. Both should be weighed in the same scales,\nand have the same measure meted out to them whether of worship or of\ncontempt.\" (Mind, ix, pp. 18-19.)\n[403] Hodgson, Time and Space, p. 404.\n[404] Compare the admirable passage in Hodgson's Time and Space, p. 310.\n[405] Philosophy of Reflection, i, 273-308.\nCHAPTER XIII.\nDISCRIMINATION AND COMPARISON.\nIt is matter of popular observation that some men have sharper senses\nthan others, and that some have acuter minds and are able to 'split\nhairs' and see two shades of meaning where the majority see but one.\nLocke long ago set apart the faculty of discrimination as one in which\nmen differ individually. What he wrote is good enough to quote as an\nintroduction to this chapter:\n\"Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of\ndiscerning and distinguishing between the several ideas it has. It\nis not enough to have a confused perception of something in general:\nunless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and\ntheir qualities, it would be capable of very little knowledge; though\nthe bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are now,\nand the mind were continually employed in thinking. On this faculty\nof distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and\ncertainty of several even very general propositions, which have passed\nfor innate truths; because men, overlooking the true cause why those\npropositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native uniform\nimpressions; whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning\nfaculty of the mind, whereby it perceives two ideas to be the same or\ndifferent. But of this more hereafter?\n\"How much the imperfection of accurately discriminating ideas one from\nanother lies either in the dulness or faults of the organs of sense,\nor want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding, or\nhastiness and precipitancy natural to some tempers, I will not here\nexamine: it suffices to take notice that this is one of the operations\nthat the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that\nconsequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in\nitself dull, or not rightly made use of for the distinguishing one\nthing from another, so far our notions are confused, and our reason\nand judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the\nmemory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this of having\nthem unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from\nanother where there is but the least difference, consists in a great\nmeasure the exactness of judgment and clearness of reason which is to\nbe observed in one man above another. And hence, perhaps, may be given\nsome reason of that common observation,--that men who have a great\ndeal of wit and prompt memories have not always the clearest judgment\nor deepest reason. For, wit lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and\nputting those together with quickness and variety wherein can be found\nany resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and\nagreeable visions in the fancy; judgment, on the contrary, lies quite\non the other side, in separating carefully one from another ideas\nwherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being\nmisled by similitude and by affinity to take one thing for another.\nThis is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion,\nwherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of\nwit which strikes so lively on the fancy, and therefore, so acceptable\nto all people because its beauty appears at first sight, and there is\nrequired no labor of thought to examine what truth or reason there is\nin it.\"[406]\nBut Locke's descendants have been slow to enter into the path whose\nfruitfulness was thus pointed out by their master, and have so\nneglected the study of discrimination that one might almost say that\nthe classic English psychologists have, as a school, hardly recognized\nit to exist. 'Association' has proved itself in their hands the one\nall-absorbing power of the mind. Dr. Martineau, in his review of Bain,\nmakes some very weighty remarks on this onesidedness of the Lockian\nschool. Our mental history, says he, is, in its view,\n\"a perpetual formation of new compounds: and the words 'association,'\n'cohesion,' 'fusion,' 'indissoluble connection,' all express the\nchange from plurality of data to some unity of result. An explanation\nof the process therefore requires two things: a true enumeration of\nthe primary constituents, and a correct statement of their laws of\ncombination: just as, in chemistry, we are furnished with a list of\nthe simple elements, and the with then principles of their synthesis.\nNow the latter of these two conditions we find satisfied by the\nassociation-psychologists: but not the former. They are not agreed\nupon their catalogue of elements, or the marks by which they may know\nthe simple from the compound. The psychologic unit is not fixed; that\nwhich is called one impression by Hartley is treated as half-a-dozen\nor more by Mill: and the tendency of the modern teachers on this point\nis to recede more and more from the better-chosen track of their\nmaster. Hartley, for example, regarded the whole present effect upon\nus of any single object--say, an orange--as a single sensation; and\nthe whole vestige it left behind, as a single 'idea of sensation.'\nHis modern disciples, on the other hand, consider this same effect\nas an aggregate from a plurality of sensations, and the ideal trace\nit leaves as highly compound. 'The idea of an object,' instead of\nbeing an elementary starting-point with them, is one of the elaborate\nresults of repetition and experience; and is continually adduced as\nremarkably illustrating the fusing power of habitual association. Thus\nJames Mill observes:\n\"'It is to this great law of association that we trace the formation\nof our ideas of what we call external objects; that is, the ideas of\na certain number of sensations, received together so frequently that\nthey coalesce as it were, and are spoken of under the idea of unity.\nHence, what we call the idea of a tree, the idea of a stone, the\nidea of a horse, the idea of a man. In using the names, tree, horse,\nman, the names of what I call objects, I am referring, and can be\nreferring, only to my own sensations; in fact, therefore, only naming\na certain number of sensations regarded as in a particular state of\ncombination, that is, concomitance. Particular sensations of sight,\nof touch, of the muscles, are the sensations to the ideas of which,\ncolor, extension, roughness, hardness, smoothness, taste, smell, so\ncoalescing as to appear one idea, I give the name of the idea of a\ntree.'[407]\n\"To precisely the same effect Mr. Bain remarks:\n\"'External objects usually affect us through a plurality of senses.\nThe pebble on the sea-shore is pictured on the eye as form and color.\nWe take it up in the hand and repeat the impression of form, with\nthe additional feeling of touch. Knock two together, and there is a\ncharacteristic sound. To preserve the impression of an object of this\nkind, there must be an association of all these different effects.\nSuch association, when matured and firm, is our idea, our intellectual\ngrasp of the pebble. Passing to the organic world, and plucking a\nrose, we have the same effects of form to the eye and hand, color and\ntouch, with new effects of odor and taste. A certain time is requisite\nfor the coherence of all these qualities in one aggregate, so as to\ngive us for all purposes the enduring image of the rose. When fully\nacquired, any one of the characteristic impressions will revive the\nothers; the odor, the sight, the feeling of the thorny stalk--each of\nthese by itself will hoist the entire impression into the view.'[408]\n\"Now, this order of derivation, making our objective knowledge begin\nwith plurality of impression and arrive at unity, we take to be a\ncomplete inversion of our psychological history. Hartley, we think,\nwas perfectly right in taking no notice of the number of inlets\nthrough which an object delivers its effect upon us, and, in spite of\nthis circumstance, treating the effect as one.... Even now, after life\nhas read us so many analytic lessons, in proportion as we can fix the\nattitude of our scene and ourselves, the sense of plurality in our\nimpressions retreats, and we lapse into an undivided consciousness;\nlosing, for instance, the separate notice of any uniform hum in the\near, or light in the eye, or weight of clothes on the body, though\nnot one of them is inoperative on the complexion of our feeling. This\nlaw, once granted, must be carried far beyond Hartley's point. Not\nonly must each object present itself to us integrally before it shells\noff into its qualities, but the whole scene around us must disengage\nfor us object after object from its still background by emergence and\nchange; and even our self-detachment from the world over against us\nmust wait for the start of collision between the force we issue and\nthat which we receive. To confine ourselves to the simplest case:\nwhen a red ivory ball, seen for the first time, has been withdrawn,\nit will leave a mental representation of itself, in which all that it\nsimultaneously gave us will indistinguishably coexist. Let a white\nball succeed to it; now, and not before, will an attribute detach\nitself, and the color, by force of contrast, be shaken out into the\nforeground. Let the white ball be replaced by an egg: and this new\ndifference will bring the form into notice from its previous slumber.\nAnd thus, that which began by being simply an object, cut out from the\nsurrounding scene, becomes for us first a _red_ object, and then a\n_red round_ object; and so on. Instead, therefore, of the qualities,\nas separately given, subscribing together and adding themselves up\nto present us with the object as their aggregate, the object is\nbeforehand with them, and from its integrity delivers them out to our\nknowledge, one by one. In this disintegration, the primary nucleus\nnever loses its substantive character or name; whilst the difference\nwhich it throws off appears as a mere attribute, expressed by an\nadjective. Hence it is that we are compelled to think of the object as\n_having_, not as _being_, its qualities; and can never heartily admit\nthe belief of any loose lot of attributes really fusing themselves\ninto a _thing_. The unity of the original whole is not felt to go\nto pieces and be resolved into the properties which it successively\ngives off; it retains a residuary existence, which constitutes it\na _substance_, as against the emerging quality, which is only its\n_phenomenal predicate_. Were it not for this perpetual process of\ndifferentiation of self from the world, of object from its scene,\nof attribute from object, no step of Abstraction could be taken; no\nqualities could fall under our notice; and had we ten thousand senses,\nthey would all converge and meet in but one consciousness. But if this\nbe so, it is an utter falsification of the order of nature to speak\nof sensations grouping themselves into aggregates, and so composing\nfor us the objects of which we think; and the whole language of\nthe theory, in regard to the field of synchronous existences, is a\ndirect inversion of the truth. Experience proceeds and intellect is\ntrained, not by Association, but by _Dissociation_, not by reduction\nof pluralities of impression to one, but by the opening out of one\ninto many; and a true psychological history must expound itself in\nanalytic rather than synthetic terms. Precisely those ideas--of\nSubstance, of Mind, of Cause, of Space--which this system treats as\ninfinitely complex, the last result of myriads of confluent elements,\nare in truth the residuary simplicities of consciousness, whose\nstability the eddies and currents of phenomenal experience have left\nundisturbed.\"[409]\nThe truth is that Experience is trained by _both_ association and\ndissociation, and that psychology must be writ _both_ in synthetic and\nin analytic terms. Our original sensible totals are, on the one hand,\nsubdivided by discriminative attention, and, on the other, united\nwith other totals,--either through the agency of our own movements,\ncarrying our senses from one part of space to another, or because new\nobjects come successively and replace those by which we were at first\nimpressed. The 'simple impression' of Hume, the 'simple idea' of Locke\nare both abstractions, never realized in experience. Experience, from\nthe very first, presents us with concreted objects, vaguely continuous\nwith the rest of the world which envelops them in space and time, and\npotentially divisible into inward elements and parts. These objects\nwe break asunder and reunite. We must treat them in both ways for our\nknowledge of them to grow; and it is hard to say, on the whole, which\nway preponderates. But since the elements with which the traditional\nassociationism performs its constructions--'simple sensations,'\nnamely--are all products of discrimination carried to a high pitch, it\nseems as if we ought to discuss the subject of analytic attention and\ndiscrimination first.\nThe noticing of any _part_ whatever of our object is an act of\ndiscrimination. Already on p. 404 I have described the manner in which\nwe often spontaneously lapse into the undiscriminating state, even with\nregard to objects which we have already learned to distinguish. Such\nan\u00e6sthetics as chloroform, nitrous oxide, etc., sometimes bring about\ntransient lapses even more total, in which numerical discrimination\nespecially seems gone; for one sees light and hears sound, but whether\none or many lights and sounds is quite impossible to tell. Where the\nparts of an object have already been discerned, and each made the\nobject of a special discriminative act, we can with difficulty feel\nthe object again in its pristine unity; and so prominent may our\nconsciousness of its composition be, that we may hardly believe that it\never could have appeared undivided. But this is an erroneous view, the\nundeniable fact being that _any number of impressions, from any number\nof sensory sources, falling simultaneously on a mind_ WHICH HAS NOT YET\nEXPERIENCED THEM SEPARATELY, _will fuse into a single undivided object\nfor that mind._ The law is that all things fuse that _can_ fuse, and\nnothing separates except what must. What makes impressions separate\nwe have to study in this chapter. Although they separate easier if\nthey come in through distinct nerves, yet distinct nerves are not an\nunconditional ground of their discrimination, as we shall presently\nsee. The baby, assailed by eyes, ears, nose, skin, and entrails at\nonce, feels it all as one great blooming, buzzing confusion; and to the\nvery end of life, our location of all things in one space is due to the\nfact that the original extents or bignesses of all the sensations which\ncame to our notice at once, coalesced together into one and the same\nspace. There is no other reason than this why \"the hand I touch and see\ncoincides spatially with the hand I immediately feel.\"[410]\nIt is true that we may sometimes be tempted to exclaim, when once a\nlot of hitherto unnoticed details of the object lie before us, \"How\ncould we ever have been ignorant of these things and yet have felt\nthe object, or drawn the conclusion, as if it were a _continuum_, a\n_plenum_? There would have been _gaps_--but we felt no gaps; wherefore\nwe must have seen and heard these details, leaned upon these steps;\nthey must have been operative upon our minds, just as they are now,\nonly _unconsciously_, or at least _inattentively_. Our first unanalyzed\nsensation was really composed of these elementary sensations, our first\nrapid conclusion was really based on these intermediate inferences, all\nthe while, only we failed to note the fact.\" But this is nothing but\nthe fatal 'psychologist's fallacy' (p. 196) of treating an inferior\nstate of mind as if it must somehow know implicitly all that is\nexplicitly known _about the same topic_ by superior states of mind.\nThe thing thought of is unquestionably the same, but it is thought\ntwice over in two absolutely different psychoses,--once as an unbroken\nunit, and again as a sum of discriminated parts. It is not one thought\nin two editions, but two entirely distinct thoughts of one thing.\nAnd each thought is within itself a _continuum_, a _plenum_, needing\nno contributions from the other to fill up its gaps. As I sit here,\nI think objects, and I make inferences, which the future is sure to\nanalyze and articulate and riddle with discriminations, showing me\nmany things wherever I now notice one. Nevertheless, my thought feels\nquite sufficient unto itself for the time being; and ranges from pole\nto pole, as free, and as unconscious of having overlooked anything, as\nif it possessed the greatest discriminative enlightenment. We all cease\nanalyzing the world at some point, and notice no more differences. The\nlast units with which we stop are our objective elements of being.\nThose of a dog are different from those of a Humboldt; those of a\npractical man from those of a metaphysician. But the dog's and the\npractical man's thoughts _feel_ continuous, though to the Humboldt or\nthe metaphysician they would appear full of gaps and defects. And they\n_are_ continuous, _as thoughts_. It is only _as mirrors of things_ that\nthe superior minds find them full of omissions. And when the omitted\nthings are discovered and the unnoticed differences laid bare, it is\nnot that the old _thoughts_ split up, but that _new thoughts supersede_\nthem, which make new judgments about the same objective world.\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF MEDIATE COMPARISON.\nWhen we discriminate an element, we may contrast it with the case of\nits own absence, of its simply not being there, without reference\nto what _is_ there; or we may also take the latter into account.\nLet the first sort of discrimination be called _existential_, the\nlatter _differential_ discrimination. A peculiarity of differential\ndiscriminations is that they result in a perception of differences\nwhich are felt as _greater or less_ one than the other. Entire groups\nof differences may be ranged in series: the musical scale, the color\nscale, are examples. Every department of our experience may have\nits data written down in an evenly gradated order, from a lowest to\na highest member. And any one datum may be a term in several such\norders. A given note may have a high place in the pitch-series, a low\nplace in the loudness-series, and a medium place in the series of\nagreeablenesses. A given tint must, in order to be fully determined,\nhave its place assigned in the series of qualities, in the series\nof purities (freedom from white), and in the series of intensities\nor brightnesses. It may be low in one of these respects, but high\nin another. In passing from term to term in any such series we are\nconscious not only of each step of difference being equal to (or\ngreater or less than) the last, but we are conscious of proceeding\nin a _uniform direction_, different from other possible directions.\nThis _consciousness of serial increase of differences_ is one of the\nfundamental facts of our intellectual life. More, _more_, MORE, of the\nsame kind of difference, we say, as we advance from term to term, and\nrealize that the farther on we get the larger grows the breach between\nthe term we are at and the one from which we started. Between any two\nterms of such a series the difference is greater than that between\nany intermediate terms, or than that between an intermediate term and\neither of the extremes. The louder than the loud is louder than the\nless loud; the farther than the far is farther than the less far; the\nearlier than the early is earlier than the late; the higher than the\nhigh is higher than the low; the bigger than the big is bigger than\nthe small; or, to put it briefly and universally, _the more than the\nmore is more than the less_; such is _the great synthetic principle of\nmediate comparison which is involved in the possession by the human\nmind of the sense of serial increase_. In Chapter XXVIII we shall see\nthe altogether overwhelming importance of this principle in the conduct\nof all our higher rational operations.\nARE ALL DIFFERENCES DIFFERENCES OF COMPOSITION?\nEach of the differences in one of these uniform series feels like a\ndefinite sensible quantity, and each term seems like the last term with\nthis quantity added. In many concrete objects which differ from one\nanother we can plainly see that the difference does consist singly\nin the fact that one object is the same as the other _plus_ something\nelse, or that they both have an identical part, to which each adds\na distinct remainder. Thus two pictures may be struck from the same\nblock, but one of them may differ in having color added; or two carpets\nmay show an identical pattern which in each is woven in distinct hues.\nSimilarly, two classes of sensation may have the same emotional tone\nbut negate each other in remaining respects--a dark color and a deep\nsound, for example; or two faces may have the same shape of nose but\neverything else unlike. The similarity of the same note sounded by\ninstruments of different timbre is explained by the coexistence of\na fundamental tone common to both, with over-tones in one which the\nother lacks. Dipping my hand into water and anon into a colder water,\nI may then observe certain additional feelings, broader and deeper\nirradiations of the cold, so to speak, which were not in the earlier\nexperience, though for aught I can tell, the feelings may be otherwise\nthe same. 'Hefting' first one weight, and then another, new feelings\nmay start out in my elbow-joint, wrist, and elsewhere, and make me call\nthe second weight the heavier of the twain. In all these cases each\nof the differing things may be represented by two parts, one that is\ncommon to it and the others, and another that is peculiar to itself. If\nthey form a series, _A, B, C, D,_ etc., and the common part be called\n_X_, whilst the lowest difference be called _d_, then the composition\nof the series would be as follows:\n_A_ = _X_ + _d_;\n_B_ = (_X_ + _d_) + _d_, or _X_ + 2_d_;\n_C_ = _X_ + 3_d_;\n_D_ = _X_ + 4_d_;\n........\nIf _X_ itself were ultimately composed of _d_'s we should have\nthe entire series explained as due to the varying combination and\nre-combination with itself of an unvarying element; and all the\napparent differences of quality would be translated into differences\nof quantity alone. This is the sort of reduction which the atomic\ntheory in physics and the mind-stuff theory in psychology regard as\ntheir ideal. So that, following the analogy of our instances, one might\neasily be tempted to generalize and to say that all difference is\nbut addition and subtraction, and that what we called 'differential'\ndiscrimination is only 'existential' discrimination in disguise; that\nis to say, that where _A_ and _B_ differ, we merely discern something\nin the one which the other is without. _Absolute identity in things\nup to a certain point, then absolute non-identity,_ would on this\ntheory take the place of those ultimate qualitative unlikenesses\nbetween them, in which we naturally believe; and the mental function\nof discrimination, ceasing to be regarded as an ultimate one, would\nresolve itself into mere logical affirmation and negation, or\nperception that a feature found in one thing, in another does not exist.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTheoretically, however, this theory is full of difficulty. If all the\ndifferences which we feel were _in one direction_, so that all objects\ncould be arranged in one series (however long), it might still work.\nBut when we consider the notorious fact that objects differ from each\nother in _divergent directions_, it grows well nigh impossible to make\nit do so. For then, supposing that an object differed from things\nin one direction by the increment _d_, it would have to differ from\nthings in another direction by a different sort of increment, call it\n_d'_; so that, after getting rid of qualitative unlikeness between\nobjects, we should have it back on our hands again between their\nincrements. We may of course re-apply our method, and say that the\ndifference between _d_ and _d'_ is not a qualitative unlikeness, but a\nfact of composition, one of them being the same as the other _plus_ an\nincrement of still higher order, _\u03b4_ for example, added. But when we\nrecollect that everything in the world can be compared with everything\nelse, and that the number of directions of difference is indefinitely\ngreat, then we see that the complication of self-compoundings of the\nultimate differential increment by which, on this theory, all the\ninnumerable unlikenesses of the world are explained, in order to avoid\nwriting any of them down as ultimate differences of kind, would beggar\nall conception. It is the mind-dust theory; with all its difficulties\nin a particularly uncompromising form; and all for the sake of the\nfantastic pleasure of being able arbitrarily to say that there is\nbetween the things in the world and between the 'ideas' in the mind\nnothing but absolute sameness and absolute not-sameness of elements,\nthe not-sameness admitting no degrees.\nTo me it seems much wiser to turn away from such transcendental\nextravagances of speculation, and to abide by the natural appearances.\nThese would leave unlikeness as an indecomposable relation amongst\nthings, and a relation moreover of which there were all degrees.\nAbsolute not-sameness would be the maximal degree, absolute sameness\nthe minimal degree of this unlikeness, the discernment of which would\nbe one of our ultimate cognitive powers.[411] Certainly the natural\nappearances are dead against the notion that no qualitative differences\nexist. With the same clearness with which, in certain objects, we do\nfeel a difference to be a mere matter of _plus_ and _minus_, in other\nobjects we feel that this is not the case. Contrast our feeling of\nthe difference between the length of two lines with our feeling of\nthe difference between blue and yellow, or with that between right\nand left. Is right equal to left with something added? Is blue yellow\n_plus_ something? If so, _plus_ what?[412] So long as we stick to\n_verifiable_ psychology, _we are forced to admit that differences of\nsimple_ KIND _form an irreducible sort of relation_ between some of\nthe elements of our experience, and forced to deny that differential\ndiscrimination can everywhere be reduced to the mere ascertainment\nthat elements present in one fact, in another fail to exist. The\nperception that an element exists in one thing and does not exist in\nanother and the perception of qualitative difference are, in short,\nentirely disconnected mental functions.[413]\nBut at the same time that we insist on this, we must also admit that\ndifferences of quality, however abundant, are not the only distinctions\nwith which our mind has to deal. Differences which seem of mere\ncomposition, of number, of _plus_ and _minus_, also abound.[414] But it\nwill be best for the present to disregard all these quantitative cases\nand, taking the others (which, by the least favorable calculation, will\nstill be numerous enough), to consider next _the manner in which we\ncome to cognize simple differences of kind_. We cannot _explain_ the\ncognition; we can only ascertain the conditions by virtue of which it\noccurs.\nTHE CONDITIONS OF DISCRIMINATION.\n_What, then, are the conditions under which we discriminate things\ndiffering in a simple way?_\nFirst, _the things must_ BE _different_, either in time, or place, or\nquality. If the difference in any of these regards is sufficiently\ngreat, then we cannot overlook it, except by not noticing the things\nat all. No one can help singling out a black stripe on a white ground,\nor feeling the contrast between a bass note and a high one sounded\nimmediately after it. Discrimination is here _involuntary_. But where\nthe objective difference is less, discrimination need not so inevitably\noccur, and may even require considerable effort of attention to be\nperformed at all.\nAnother condition which then favors it is that the sensations excited\nby _the differing objects should not come to us simultaneously but fall\nin immediate_ SUCCESSION upon the same organ. It is easier to compare\nsuccessive than simultaneous sounds, easier to compare two weights\nor two temperatures by testing one after the other with the same\nhand, than by using both hands and comparing both at once. Similarly\nit is easier to discriminate shades of light or color by moving the\neye from one to the other, so that they successively stimulate the\nsame retinal tract. In testing the local discrimination of the skin,\nby applying compass-points, it is found that they are felt to touch\ndifferent spots much more readily when set down one after the other\nthan when both are applied at once. In the latter case they may be two\nor three inches apart on the back, thighs, etc., and still feel as\nif they were set down in one spot. Finally, in the case of smell and\ntaste it is well-nigh impossible to compare simultaneous impressions\nat all. The reason why successive impression so much favors the result\nseems to be that there is a real _sensation of difference_, aroused\nby the shock of transition from one perception to another which is\nunlike the first. This sensation of difference has its own peculiar\nquality, as difference, which remains sensible, no matter of what sort\nthe terms may be, between which it obtains. It is, in short, one of\nthose transitive feelings, or feelings of relation, of which I treated\nin a former place (pp. 245 ff.); and, when once aroused, its object\nlingers in the memory along with the substantive terms which precede\nand follow, and enables our _judgments of comparison_ to be made.\nWe shall soon see reason to believe that no two terms can possibly\nbe _simultaneously_ perceived to differ, unless, in a preliminary\noperation, we have successively attended to each, and, in so doing, had\nthe transitional sensation of difference between them aroused. A field\nof consciousness, however complex, is never analyzed unless some of\nits ingredients have changed. We _now_ discern, 'tis true, a multitude\nof coexisting things about us at every moment: but this is because we\nhave had a long education, and each thing we now see distinct has been\nalready differentiated from its neighbors by repeated appearances in\nsuccessive order. To the infant, sounds, sights, touches, and pains,\nform probably one unanalyzed bloom of confusion.[415]\nWhere the difference between the successive sensations is but slight,\nthe transition between them must be made as immediate as possible, and\nboth must be compared _in memory_, in order to get the best results.\nOne cannot judge accurately of the difference between two similar\nwines, whilst the second is still in one's mouth. So of sounds,\nwarmths, etc.--we must get the dying phases of both sensations of the\npair we are comparing. Where, however, the difference is strong, this\ncondition is immaterial, and we can then compare a sensation actually\nfelt with another carried in memory only. The longer the interval of\ntime between the sensations, the more uncertain is their discrimination.\nThe difference, thus immediately felt between two terms, is independent\nof our ability to identify either of the terms by itself. I can feel\ntwo distinct spots to be touched on my skin, yet not know which is\nabove and which below. I can observe two neighboring musical tones to\ndiffer, and still not know which of the two is the higher in pitch.\nSimilarly I may discriminate two neighboring tints, whilst remaining\nuncertain which is the bluer or the yellower, or _how_ either differs\nfrom its mate.[416]\n*       *       *       *       *\nWith such direct perceptions of difference as this, we must not\nconfound those entirely unlike cases in which we _infer_ that two\nthings must differ because we know enough _about_ each of them taken\nby itself to warrant our classing them under distinct heads. It often\nhappens, when the interval is long between two experiences, that our\njudgments are guided, not so much by a positive image or copy of the\nearlier one, as by our recollection of certain facts about it. Thus I\nknow that the sunshine to-day is less bright than on a certain day last\nweek, because I then said it was quite dazzling, a remark I should not\nnow care to make. Or I know myself to feel better now than I was last\nsummer, because I can now psychologize, and then I could not. We are\nconstantly busy comparing feelings with whose quality our imagination\nhas no sort of _acquaintance_ at the time--pleasures, or pains, for\nexample. It is notoriously hard to conjure up in imagination a lively\nimage of either of these classes of feeling. The associationists may\nprate of an idea of pleasure being a pleasant idea, of an idea of\npain being a painful one, but the unsophisticated sense of mankind is\nagainst them, agreeing with Homer that the memory of griefs when past\nmay be a joy, and with Dante that there is no greater sorrow than, in\nmisery, to recollect one's happier time.\nFeelings remembered in this imperfect way _must_ be compared with\npresent or recent feelings by the aid of what we know about them. We\nidentify the remote experience in such a case by _conceiving it_. The\nmost perfect way of conceiving it is by defining it in terms of some\nstandard scale. If I know the thermometer to stand at zero to-day and\nto have stood at 32\u00b0 last Sunday, I know to-day to be colder, and I\nknow just how much colder, than it was last Sunday. If I know that a\ncertain note was _c_, and that this note is _d_, I know that this note\nmust be the higher of the two.\nThe inference that two things differ because their concomitants,\neffects, names, kinds, or--to put it generally--their _signs_, differ,\nis of course susceptible of unlimited complication. The sciences\nfurnish examples, in the way in which men are led, by noticing\ndifferences in effects, to assume new hypothetical causes, differing\nfrom any known heretofore. But no matter how many may be the steps\nby which such inferential discriminations are made, _they all end in\na direct intuition of difference somewhere_. The _last_ ground for\ninferring that A and B differ must be that, whilst A is an _m_, B is\nan _n_, and that _m_ and _n_ are _seen to differ_. Let us then neglect\nthe complex cases, the A's and the B's, and go back to the study of the\nunanalyzable perception of difference between their signs, the _m_'s\nand the _n_'s, when these are seemingly simple terms.\nI said that in their immediate succession the shock of their difference\nwas _felt_. It is felt _repeatedly_ when we go back and forth from\n_m_ to _n_; and we make a point of getting it thus repeatedly (by\nalternating our attention at least) whenever the shock is so slight\nas to be with difficulty perceived. But in addition to being felt\nat the brief instant of transition, the difference also feels as\nif incorporated and taken up into the second term, which feels\n'different-from-the-first' even while it lasts. It is obvious that the\n'second term' of the mind in this case is not bald _n_, but a very\ncomplex object; and that the sequence is not simply first '_m_,' then\n'_difference_,' then '_n_'; but first '_m_,' then '_difference_,' then\n'_n-different-from-m_.' The several thoughts, however, to which these\nthree several objects are revealed, are three ordinary 'segments' of\nthe mental 'stream.'\nAs our brains and minds are actually made, it is impossible to get\ncertain _m_'s and _n_'s in immediate sequence and to keep them _pure_.\nIf kept pure, it would mean that they remained uncompared. With us,\ninevitably, by a mechanism which we as yet fail to understand, the\nshock of difference is felt between them, and the second object is not\n_n_ pure, but _n-as-different-from-m_.[417] It is no more a paradox\nthat under these conditions this cognition of _m_ and _n_ in mutual\nrelation should occur, than that under other conditions the cognition\nof _m_'s or _n_'s simple quality should occur. But as it has been\ntreated as a paradox, and as a spiritual agent, not itself a portion\nof the stream, has been invoked to account for it, a word of further\nremark seems desirable.\nMy account, it will be noted, is merely a description of the facts\nas they occur: feelings (or thoughts) each knowing something, but\nthe later one knowing, if preceded by a certain earlier one, a more\ncomplicated object than it would have known had the earlier one not\nbeen there. I offer no _explanation_ of such a sequence of cognitions.\nThe explanation (I devoutly expect) will be found some day to depend\non cerebral conditions. Until it is forthcoming, we can only treat the\nsequence as a special case of the general law that every experience\nundergone by the brain leaves in it a modification which is one factor\nin determining what manner of experiences the following ones shall be\n(_cf._ pp. 232-236). To anyone who denies the possibility of such a law\nI have nothing to say, until he brings his proofs.\nThe sensationalists and the spiritualists meanwhile (filled both of\nthem with their notion that the mind must in some fashion _contain_\nwhat it knows) begin by giving a crooked account of the facts. Both\nadmit that for _m_ and _n_ to be known in any way whatever, little\nrounded and finished off duplicates of each must be contained in the\nmind as separate entities. These pure ideas, so called, of _m_ and _n_\nrespectively, succeed each other there. And since they _are distinct_,\nsay the sensationalists, they are _eo ipso_ distinguished. \"To have\nideas different and ideas distinguished, are synonymous expressions;\ndifferent and distinguished meaning exactly the same thing,\" says James\nMill.[418] \"Distinguished!\" say the spiritualists, \"distinguished _by\nwhat_, forsooth? Truly the respective ideas of _m_ and of _n_ in the\nmind are distinct. But for that very reason neither can distinguish\nitself from the other, for to do that it would have to be aware of the\nother, and thus for the time being become the other, and that would\nbe to get mixed up with the other and to lose its own distinctness.\nDistinctness of ideas and idea of distinctness, are not one thing, but\ntwo. This last is a _relation_. Only a _relating principle_, opposed\nin nature to all facts of feeling, an Ego, Soul, or Subject, is\ncompetent, by being present to both of the ideas alike, to hold them\ntogether and at the same time to keep them distinct.\"\nBut if the plain facts be admitted that the _pure_ idea of '_n_' is\n_never in the mind at all_, when '_m_' has once gone before; and that\nthe feeling '_n-different-from-m_' is itself an absolutely unique\npulse of thought, the bottom of this precious quarrel drops out and\nneither party is left with anything to fight about. Surely such a\nconsummation ought to be welcomed, especially when brought about, us\nhere, by a formulation of the facts which offers itself so naturally\nand unsophistically.[419]\nWe may, then, conclude our examination of the manner in which simple\ninvoluntary discrimination comes about, by saying, 1) that its vehicle\nis a thought possessed of a knowledge of both terms compared and of\ntheir difference; 2) that the necessary and sufficient condition (as\nthe human mind goes) for arousing this thought is that a thought or\nfeeling of one of the terms discriminated should, as immediately as\npossible, precede that in which the other term is known; and 3) and\nthat the thought which knows the second term will then also know the\ndifference (or in more difficult cases will be continuously succeeded\nby one which does know the difference) and both of the terms between\nwhich it holds.\nThis last thought need, however, not _be_ these terms with their\ndifference, nor _contain_ them. A man's thought can know and mean\nall sorts of things without those things getting bodily into it--the\ndistant, for example, the future, and the past.[420] The vanishing\nterm in the case which occupies us vanishes; but because it is the\nspecific term it is and nothing else, it leaves a specific influence\nbehind it when it vanishes, the effect of which is to determine the\nsucceeding pulse of thought in a perfectly characteristic way. Whatever\nconsciousness comes next must know the vanished term and call it\ndifferent from the one now there.\nHere we are at the end of our tether about involuntary discrimination\nof successively felt simple things; and must drop the subject,\nhopeless of seeing any deeper into it for the present, and turn to\ndiscriminations of a less simple sort.\nTHE PROCESS OF ANALYSIS.\nAnd first, of the discrimination of simultaneously felt impressions!\nOur first way of looking at a reality is often to suppose it simple,\nbut later we may learn to perceive it as compound. This new way of\nknowing the same reality may conveniently be called by the name of\n_Analysis_. It is manifestly one of the most incessantly performed of\nall our mental processes, so let us examine the conditions under which\nit occurs.\nI think we may safely lay down at the outset this fundamental\nprinciple, that _any total impression made on the mind must be\nunanalyzable, whose elements are never experienced apart_. The\ncomponents of an absolutely changeless group of not-elsewhere-occurring\nattributes could never be discriminated. If all cold things were wet\nand all wet things cold, if all hard things pricked our skin, and no\nother things did so; is it likely that we should discriminate between\ncoldness and wetness, and hardness and pungency respectively? If all\nliquids were transparent and no non-liquid were transparent, it would\nbe long before we had separate names for liquidity and transparency. If\nheat were a function of position above the earth's surface, so that the\nhigher a thing was the hotter it became, one word would serve for hot\nand high. We have, in fact, a number of sensations whose concomitants\nare almost invariably the same, and we find it, accordingly, almost\nimpossible to analyze them out from the totals in which they are found.\nThe contraction of the diaphragm and the expansion of the lungs, the\nshortening of certain muscles and the rotation of certain joints, are\nexamples. The converging of the eyeballs and the accommodation for near\nobjects are, for each distance of the object (in the common use of the\neyes) inseparably linked, and neither can (without a sort of artificial\ntraining which shall presently be mentioned) be felt by itself. We\nlearn that the _causes_ of such groups of feelings are multiple, and\ntherefore we frame theories about the composition of the feelings\nthemselves, by 'fusion,' 'integration,' 'synthesis,' or what not. But\nby direct introspection no analysis of them is ever made. A conspicuous\ncase will come to view when we treat of the emotions. Every emotion\nhas its 'expression,' of quick breathing, palpitating heart, flushed\nface, or the like. The expression gives rise to bodily feelings; and\nthe emotion is thus necessarily and invariably accompanied by these\nbodily feelings. The consequence is that it is impossible to apprehend\nit as a spiritual state by itself, or to analyze it away from the\nlower feelings in question. It is in fact impossible to prove that it\nexists as a distinct psychic fact. The present writer strongly doubts\nthat it does so exist. But those who are most firmly persuaded of its\nexistence must wait, to prove their point, until they can quote some as\nyet unfound pathological case of an individual who shall have emotions\nin a body in which either complete paralysis will have prevented their\nexpression, or complete an\u00e6sthesia will have made the latter unfelt.\nIn general, then, if an object affects us simultaneously in a number of\nways, _abcd_, we get a peculiar integral impression, which thereafter\ncharacterizes to our mind the individuality of that object, and becomes\nthe sign of its presence; and which is only resolved into _a, b, c, d,_\nrespectively by the aid of farther experiences. These we now may turn\nto consider.\n_If any single quality or constituent, a, of such an object, have\npreviously been known by us isolatedly,_ or have in any other manner\nalready become an object of separate acquaintance on our part, so that\nwe have an image of it, distinct or vague, in our mind, disconnected\nwith _bcd, then that constituent a may be analyzed out from the total\nimpression_. Analysis of a thing means separate attention to each of\nits parts. In Chapter XI we saw that one condition of attending to a\nthing was the formation from within of a separate image of that thing,\nwhich should, as it were, go out to meet the impression received.\nAttention being the condition of analysis, and separate imagination\nbeing the condition of attention, it follows also that separate\nimagination is the condition of analysis. _Only such elements as we\nare acquainted with, and can imagine, separately, can be discriminated\nwithin a total sense-impression_. The image seems to welcome its own\nmate from out of the compound, and to heighten the feeling thereof;\nwhereas it dampens and opposes the feeling of the other constituents;\nand thus the compound becomes broken for our consciousness into parts.\nAll the facts cited in Chapter XI, to prove that attention involves\ninward reproduction, go to prove this point as well. In looking for any\nobject in a room, for a book in a library, for example, we detect it\nthe more readily if, in addition to merely knowing its name, etc., we\ncarry in our mind a distinct image of its appearance. The assaf\u0153tida\nin 'Worcestershire sauce' is not obvious to anyone who has not tasted\nassaf\u0153tida _per se_. In a 'cold' color an artist would never be able to\nanalyze out the pervasive presence of _blue_, unless he had previously\nmade acquaintance with the color blue by itself. All the colors we\nactually experience are mixtures. Even the purest primaries always come\nto us with some white. Absolutely pure red or green or violet is never\nexperienced, and so can never be discerned in the so-called primaries\nwith which we have to deal: the latter consequently pass for pure.--The\nreader will remember how an overtone can only be attended to in the\nmidst of its consorts in the voice of a musical instrument, by sounding\nit previously alone. The imagination, being then full of it, hears\nthe like of it in the compound tone. Helmholtz, whose account of this\nobservation we formerly quoted, goes on to explain the difficulty of\nthe case in a way which beautifully corroborates the point I now seek\nto prove. He says:\n\"The ultimate simple elements of the sensation of tone, simple tones\nthemselves, are rarely heard alone. Even those instruments by which\nthey can be produced (as tuning-forks before resonance-chambers),\nwhen strongly excited, give rise to weak harmonic upper partials,\npartly within and partly without the ear.... Hence the opportunities\nare very scanty for impressing on our memory an exact and sure image\nof these simple elementary tones. But if the constituents are only\nindefinitely and vaguely known, the analysis of their sum into them\nmust be correspondingly uncertain. If we do not know with certainty\nhow much of the musical tone under consideration is to be attributed\nto its prime, we cannot but be uncertain as to what belongs to the\npartials. Consequently we must begin by making the individual elements\nwhich have to be distinguished individually audible, so as to obtain\nan entirely fresh recollection of the corresponding sensation, and the\nwhole business requires undisturbed and concentrated attention. We are\neven without the ease that can be obtained by frequent repetitions of\nthe experiment, such as we possess in the analysis of musical chords\ninto their individual notes. In that case we hear the individual notes\nsufficiently often by themselves, whereas we rarely hear simple tones,\nand may almost be said never to hear the building up of a compound\nfrom its simple tones.\"[421]\nTHE PROCESS OF ABSTRACTION.\nVery few elements of reality are experienced by us in absolute\nisolation. The most that usually happens to a constituent _a_, of a\ncompound phenomenon _abcd_, is that its _strength_ relatively to _bcd_\nvaries from a maximum to a minimum; or that it appears linked with\n_other_ qualities, in other compounds, as _aefg_, or _ahik_. Either\nof these vicissitudes in the mode of our experiencing _a_ may, under\nfavorable circumstances, lead us to feel the difference between it and\nits concomitants, and to single it out--not absolutely, it is true, but\napproximately--and so to analyze the compound of which it is a part.\nThe act of singling out is then called _abstraction_, and the element\ndisengaged is an _abstract_.\nConsider the case of fluctuations of relative strength or intensity\nfirst. Let there be three grades of the compound, as _Abcd, abcd,_ and\n_abcD_. In passing between these compounds, the mind will feel shocks\nof difference. The differences, moreover, will serially increase, and\ntheir direction will be felt as of a distinct sort. The increase from\n_abcd_ to _Abcd_ is on the _a_ side; that to _abcD_ is on the _d_ side.\nAnd these two differences of direction are differently felt. I do not\nsay that this discernment of the _a_-direction from the _d_-direction\nwill give us an actual intuition either of _a_ or of _d_ in the\nabstract. But it leads us to _conceive_ or _postulate_ each of these\nqualities, and to define it as the _extreme_ of a certain direction.\n'Dry' wines and 'sweet' wines, for example, differ, and form a series.\nIt happens that we have an experience of sweetness pure and simple in\nthe taste of sugar, and this we can analyze out of the wine-taste.\nBut no one knows what 'dryness' tastes like, all by itself. It must,\nhowever, be something extreme in the dry direction; and we should\nprobably not fail to recognize it as the original of our abstract\nconception, in case we ever did come across it. In some such way we get\nto form notions of the flavor of meats, apart from their feeling to the\ntongue, or of that of fruits apart from their acidity, etc., and we\nabstract the touch of bodies as distinct from their temperature. We may\neven apprehend the quality of a muscle's contraction as distinguished\nfrom its extent, or one muscle's contraction from another's, as when,\nby practising with prismatic glasses, and varying our eyes' convergence\nwhilst our accommodation remains the same, we learn the direction\nin which our feeling of the convergence differs from that of the\naccommodation.\nBut the fluctuation in a quality's intensity is a less efficient aid\nto our abstracting of it than the diversity of the other qualities in\nwhose company it may appear. _What is associated now with one thing and\nnow with another tends to become dissociated from either, and to grow\ninto an object of abstract contemplation by the mind._ One might call\nthis the _law of dissociation by varying concomitants_. The practical\nresult of it will be to allow the mind which has thus dissociated and\nabstracted a character to analyze it out of a total, whenever it meets\nwith it again. The law has been frequently recognized by psychologists,\nthough I know of none who has given it the emphatic prominence in our\nmental history which it deserves. Mr. Spencer says:\n\"If the property A occurs here along with the properties B, C, D,\nthere along with C, F, H, and again with E, G, B,... it must happen\nthat by multiplication of experiences the impressions produced by\nthese properties on the organism will be disconnected and rendered\nso far independent in the organism as the properties are in the\nenvironment, whence must eventually result a power to recognize\nattributes in themselves, apart from particular bodies.\"[422]\nAnd still more to the point Dr. Martineau, in the passage I have\nalready quoted, writes:\n\"When a red ivory ball, seen for the first time, has been withdrawn,\nit will leave a mental representation of itself, in which all that\nit simultaneously gave us will indistinguishably coexist. Let a white\nball succeed to it; now, and not before, will an attribute detach\nitself, and the _color_, by force of contrast, be shaken out into\nthe foreground. Let the white ball be replaced by an egg, and this\nnew difference will bring the _form_ into notice from its previous\nslumber, and thus that which began by being simply an object cut out\nfrom the surrounding scene becomes for us first a _red_ object, then a\n_red round_ object, and so on.\"\n_Why_ the repetition of the character in combination with different\nwholes will cause it thus to break up its adhesion with any one of\nthem, and roll out, as it were, alone upon the table of consciousness,\nis a little of a mystery. One might suppose the nerve-processes of the\nvarious concomitants to neutralize or inhibit each other more or less\nand to leave the process of the common term alone distinctly active.\nMr. Spencer appears to think that the mere fact that the common term\nis repeated more often than any one of its associates will, of itself,\ngive it such a degree of intensity that its abstraction must needs\nensue.\nThis has a plausible sound, but breaks down when examined closely. For\nit is not always the often-repeated character which is first noticed\nwhen its concomitants have varied a certain number of times; it is\neven more likely to be the most novel of all the concomitants, which\nwill arrest the attention. If a boy has seen nothing all his life but\nsloops and schooners, he will probably never distinctly have singled\nout in his notion of 'sail' the character of being hung lengthwise.\nWhen for the first time he sees a square-rigged ship, the opportunity\nof extracting the lengthwise mode of hanging as a special accident, and\nof dissociating it from the general notion of sail, is offered. But\nthere are twenty chances to one that that will not be the form of the\nboy's consciousness. What he _notices_ will be the new and exceptional\ncharacter of being hung crosswise. He will go home and speak of\nthat, and perhaps never consciously formulate what the more familiar\npeculiarity consists in.\nThis mode of abstraction is realized on a very wide scale, because the\nelements of the world in which we find ourselves appear, as a matter of\nfact, here, there, and everywhere, and are changing their concomitants\nall the while. But on the other hand the abstraction is, so to speak,\nnever complete, the analysis of a compound never perfect, because\nno element is ever given to us absolutely alone, and we can never\ntherefore approach a compound with the image in our mind of any one of\nits components in a perfectly pure form. Colors, sounds, smells, are\njust as much entangled with other matter as are more formal elements of\nexperience, such as extension, intensity, effort, pleasure, difference,\nlikeness, harmony, badness, strength, and even consciousness itself.\nAll are embedded in one world. But by the fluctuations and permutations\nof which we have spoken, we come to form a pretty good notion of\nthe _direction_ in which each element differs from the rest, and so\nwe frame the notion of it as a _terminus_, and continue to mean it\nas an individual thing. In the case of many elements, the simple\nsensibles, like heat, cold, the colors, smells, etc., the extremes\nof the directions are almost touched, and in these instances we have\na comparatively exact perception of what it is we mean to abstract.\nBut even this is only an approximation; and in literal mathematical\nstrictness _all_ our abstracts must be confessed to be but imperfectly\nimaginable things. At bottom the process is one of _conception_, and is\neverywhere, even in the sphere of simple sensible qualities, the same\nas that by which we are usually understood to attain to the notions of\nabstract goodness, perfect felicity, absolute power, and the like: the\ndirect perception of a difference between compounds, and the imaginary\nprolongation of the direction of the difference to an ideal terminus,\nthe notion of which we fix and keep as one of our permanent subjects of\ndiscourse.\nThis is all that I can say usefully about abstraction, or about\nanalysis, to which it leads.\nTHE IMPROVEMENT OF DISCRIMINATION BY PRACTICE.\nIn all the cases considered hitherto I have supposed the differences\ninvolved to be so large as to be flagrant, and the discrimination,\nwhere successive, was treated as involuntary. But, so far from being\nalways involuntary, discriminations are often difficult in the extreme,\nand by most men never performed. Professor de Morgan, thinking, it is\ntrue, rather of conceptual than of perceptive discrimination, wrote,\nwittily enough:\n\"The great bulk of the illogical part of the educated\ncommunity--whether majority or minority I know not; perhaps six of one\nand half a dozen of the other--have not power to make a distinction,\nand of course cannot be made to take a distinction, and of course\nnever attempt to shake a distinction. With them all such things are\nevasions, subterfuges, come-offs, loop-holes, etc. They would hang a\nman for horse-stealing under a statute against sheep-stealing; and\nwould laugh at you if you quibbled about the distinction between a\nhorse and a sheep.\"[423]\nAny personal or practical interest, however, in the results to be\nobtained by distinguishing, makes one's wits amazingly sharp to\ndetect differences. The culprit himself is not likely to overlook the\ndifference between a horse and a sheep. And long training and practice\nin distinguishing has the same effect as personal interest. Both of\nthese agencies give to small amounts of objective difference the same\neffectiveness upon the mind that, under other circumstances, only large\nones would have. Let us seek to penetrate the _modus operandi_ of their\ninfluence--beginning with that of practice and habit.\nThat 'practice makes perfect' is notorious in the field of motor\naccomplishments. But motor accomplishments depend in part on sensory\ndiscrimination. Billiard-playing, rifle-shooting, tight-rope-dancing,\ndemand the most delicate appreciation of minute disparities of\nsensation, as well as the power to make accurately graduated muscular\nresponse thereto. In the purely sensorial field we have the well-known\nvirtuosity displayed by the professional buyers and testers of various\nkinds of goods. One man will distinguish by taste between the upper\nand the lower half of a bottle of old Madeira. Another will recognize,\nby feeling the flour in a barrel, whether the wheat was grown in Iowa\nor Tennessee. The blind deaf-mute, Laura Bridgman, had so improved her\ntouch as to recognize, after a year's interval, the hand of a person\nwho once had shaken hers; and her sister in misfortune, Julia Brace, is\nsaid to have been employed in the Hartford Asylum to sort the linen\nof its multitudinous inmates, after it came from the wash, by her\nwonderfully educated sense of smell.\nThe fact is so familiar that few, if any, psychologists have even\nrecognized it as needing explanation. They have seemed to think that\npractice must, in the nature of things, improve the delicacy of\ndiscernment, and have let the matter rest. At most they have said:\n\"Attention accounts for it; we attend more to habitual things, and what\nwe attend to we perceive more minutely.\" This answer is true, but too\ngeneral; it seems to me that we can be a little more precise.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_There are at least two distinct causes_ which we can see at work\nwhenever experience improves discrimination:\nFirst, the _terms_ whose difference comes to be felt contract disparate\nassociates and these help to drag them apart.\nSecond, the _difference_ reminds us of larger differences of the same\nsort, and these help us to notice it.\nLet us study the first cause first, and begin by supposing two\ncompounds, of ten elements apiece. Suppose no one element of either\ncompound to differ from the corresponding element of the other compound\nenough to be distinguished from it if the two are compared alone, and\nlet the amount of this imperceptible difference be called equal to 1.\nThe compounds will differ from each other, however, in ten different\nways; and, although each difference by itself might pass unperceived,\nthe total difference, equal to 10, may very well be sufficient to\nstrike the sense. In a word, _increasing the number of 'points'\ninvolved in a difference may excite our discrimination as effectually\nas increasing the amount of difference at any one point_. Two men whose\nmouth, nose, eyes, cheeks, chin, and hair, all differ slightly, will\nbe as little confounded by us, as two appearances of the same man one\nwith, and the other without, a false nose. The only contrast in the\ncases is that we can easily name the _point_ of difference in the one,\nwhilst in the other we cannot.\nTwo things, then, B and C, indistinguishable when compared together\nalone, may each contract adhesions with different associates, and the\ncompounds thus formed may, as wholes, be judged very distinct. _The\neffect of practice in increasing discrimination must then, in part\nbe due to the reinforcing effect, upon an original slight difference\nbetween the terms, of additional differences between the diverse\nassociates which they severally affect._ Let B and C be the terms: If\nA contract adhesions with B, and C with D, AB may appear very distinct\nfrom CD, though B and C _per se_ might have been almost identical.\nTo illustrate, how does one learn to distinguish claret from burgundy?\nProbably they have been drunk on different occasions. When we first\ndrank claret we heard it called by that name, we were eating such and\nsuch a dinner, etc. Next time we drink it, a dim reminder of all those\nthings chimes through us as we get the taste of the wine. When we try\nburgundy our first impression is that it is a kind of claret; but\nsomething falls short of full identification, and presently we hear it\ncalled burgundy. During the next few experiences, the discrimination\nmay still be uncertain--\"which,\" we ask ourselves, \"of the two wines is\nthis present specimen?\" But at last the claret-flavor recalls pretty\ndistinctly its own name, 'claret,' \"that wine I drank at So-and-so's\ntable,\" etc.; and the burgundy-flavor recalls the name burgundy and\nsome one else's table. _And only when this different_ SETTING _has\ncome to each is our discrimination between the two flavors solid and\nstable._ After a while the tables and other parts of the setting,\nbesides the name, grow so multifarious as not to come up distinctly\ninto consciousness; but _pari passu_ with this, the adhesion of each\nwine with its own _name_ becomes more and more inveterate, and at last\neach flavor suggests instantly and certainly its own name and nothing\nelse. The names differ far more than the flavors, and help to stretch\nthese latter farther apart. Some such process as this must go on in all\nour experience. Beef and mutton, strawberries and raspberries, odor of\nrose and odor of violet, contract different adhesions which reinforce\nthe differences already felt in the terms.\nThe reader may say that this has nothing to do with making us feel the\n_difference_ between the two terms. It is merely fixing, identifying,\nand so to speak substantializing, the _terms_. But what we feel as\ntheir _difference_, we should feel, even though we were unable to name\nor otherwise identify the terms.\nTo which I reply that I believe that the difference is always concreted\nand made to seem _more substantial_ by recognizing the terms. I went\nout for instance the other day and found that the snow just fallen\nhad a very odd look, different from the common appearance of snow. I\npresently called it a 'micaceous' look; and it seemed to me as if, the\nmoment I did so, the difference grew more distinct and fixed than it\nwas before. The other connotations of the word 'micaceous' dragged the\nsnow farther away from ordinary snow and seemed even to aggravate the\npeculiar look in question. I think some such effect as this on our way\nof feeling a difference will be very generally admitted to follow from\nnaming the terms between which it obtains; although I admit myself that\nit is difficult to show coercively that naming or otherwise identifying\nany given pair of hardly distinguishable terms is essential to their\nbeing felt as different at _first_.[424]\nI offer the explanation only as a partial one: it certainly is\nnot complete. Take the way in which _practice refines our local\ndiscrimination on the skin_, for example. Two compass-points touching\nthe palm of the hand must be kept, say, half an inch asunder in order\nnot to be mistaken for one point. But at the end of an hour or so of\npractice with them we can distinguish them as two, even when less than\na quarter of an inch apart. If the same two regions of the skin were\nconstantly touched, in this experience, the explanation we have been\nconsidering would perfectly apply. Suppose a line _a b c d e f_ of\npoints upon the skin. Suppose the local difference of feeling between\n_a_ and _f_ to be so strong as to be instantly recognized when the\npoints are simultaneously touched, but suppose that between _c_ and\n_d_ to be at first too small for this purpose. If we began by putting\nthe compasses on _a_ and _f_ and gradually contracted their opening,\nthe strong doubleness recognized at first would still be _suggested_,\nas the compass-points approached the positions _c_ and _d_; for the\npoint _e_ would be so near _f_, and so like it, as not to be aroused\nwithout _f_ also coming to mind. Similarly _d_ would recall _e_ and,\nmore remotely, _f_. In such wise _c--d_ would no longer be bare _c--d_,\nbut something more like _abc--def_,--palpably differing impressions.\nBut in actual experience the education can take place in a much less\nmethodical way, and we learn at last to discriminate _c_ and _d_\nwithout any constant adhesion being contracted between one of these\nspots and _ab_, and the other and _ef_. Volkmann's experiments show\nthis. He and Fechner, prompted by Czermak's observation that the skin\nof the blind was twice as discriminative as that of seeing folks,\nsought by experiment to show the effects of practice upon themselves.\nThey discovered that even within the limits of a single sitting the\ndistances at which points were felt double might fall at the end to\nconsiderably less than half of their magnitude at the beginning; and\nthat some, though not all, of this improved sensibility was retained\nnext day. But they also found that exercising one part of the skin in\nthis way improved the discrimination not only of the corresponding part\nof the opposite side of the body, but of the neighboring parts as well.\nThus, at the beginning of an experimental sitting, the compass-points\nhad to be a Paris line asunder, in order to be distinguished by the\nlittle-finger-tip. But after exercising the _other fingers_, it was\nfound that the little-finger-tip could discriminate points only half a\nline apart.[425] The same relation existed betwixt divers points of the\narm and hand.[426]\nHere it is clear that the cause which I first suggested fails to apply,\nand that we must invoke another.\nWhat are the exact experimental phenomena? The spots, as such, are\nnot distinctly located, and the difference, as such, between their\nfeelings, is not distinctly felt, until the interval is greater than\nthe minimum required for the mere perception of their _doubleness_.\nWhat we first feel is a bluntness, then a suspicion of doubleness,\nwhich presently becomes a distinct doubleness, and at last two\ndifferent-feeling and differently placed spots with a definite tract\nof space between them. Some of the places we try give us this latest\nstage of the perception immediately; some only give us the earliest;\nand between them are intermediary places. But as soon as the _image of\nthe doubleness_ as it is felt in the more discriminative places gets\nlodged in our memory, it helps us to find its like in places where\notherwise we might have missed it, much as the recent hearing of an\n'overtone' helps us to detect the latter in a compound sound (_supra_,\npp. 439-40). A dim doubleness grows clearer by being assimilated to\nthe image of a distincter doubleness felt a moment before. It is\ninterpreted by means of the latter. And so is any difference, like any\nother sort of impression, more easily perceived when we carry in our\nmind to meet it a distinct image of what sort of a thing we are to look\nfor, of what its nature is likely to be.[427]\n_These two processes_, the reinforcement of the terms by disparate\nassociates, and the filling of the memory with past differences, of\nsimilar direction with the present one, but of more conspicuous amount,\n_are the only explanations I can offer of the effects of education\nin this line_. What is accomplished by both processes is essentially\nthe same thing: they make small differences affect us as if they were\nlarge ones--that large differences should affect us as they do remains\nan inexplicable fact. In principle these two processes ought to be\nsufficient to account for all possible cases. Whether in fact they are\nsufficient, whether there be no residual factor which we have failed to\ndetect and analyze out, I will not presume to decide.\nPRACTICAL INTERESTS LIMIT DISCRIMINATION.\nIt will be remembered that on page 509 personal interest was named\nas a sharpener of discrimination alongside of practice. But personal\ninterest probably acts through attention and not in any immediate or\nspecific way. A distinction in which we have a practical stake is one\nwhich we concentrate our minds upon and which we are on the look-out\nfor. We draw it frequently, and we get all the benefits of so doing,\nbenefits which have just been explained. Where, on the other hand,\na distinction has no practical interest, where we gain nothing by\nanalyzing a feature from out of the compound total of which it forms\na part, we contract a habit of leaving it unnoticed, and at last grow\ncallous to its presence. Helmholtz was the first psychologist who dwelt\non these facts as emphatically as they deserve, and I can do no better\nthan quote his very words.\n\"We are accustomed,\" he says, \"in a large number of cases where\nsensations of different kinds, or in different parts of the body,\nexist simultaneously, to recognize that they are distinct as soon as\nthey are perceived, and to direct our attention at will to any one of\nthem separately. Thus at any moment we can be separately conscious of\nwhat we see, of what we hear, of what we feel; and distinguish what we\nfeel in a finger or in the great toe, whether pressure, gentle touch,\nor warmth. So also in the field of vision. Indeed, as I shall endeavor\nto show in what follows, we readily distinguish our sensations\nfrom one another _when we have a precise knowledge_ that they are\ncomposite, as, for example, when we have become certain, by frequently\nrepeated and invariable experience, that our present sensation arises\nfrom the simultaneous action of many independent stimuli, each of\nwhich usually excites an equally well-known individual sensation.\"\nThis, it will be observed, is only another statement of our law, that\nthe only individual components which we can pick out of compounds are\nthose of which we have independent knowledge in a separate form.\n\"This induces us to think that nothing can be easier, when a number of\ndifferent sensations are simultaneously excited, than to distinguish\nthem individually from each other, and that this is an innate faculty\nof our minds.\n\"Thus we find, among other things, that it is quite a matter of course\nto hear separately the different musical tones which come to our\nsenses collectively; and we expect that in every case when two of them\noccur together, we shall be able to do the like.\n\"The matter becomes very different when we set to work to investigate\nthe more unusual cases of perception, and seek more completely to\nunderstand the conditions under which the above-mentioned distinction\ncan or cannot be made, as is the case in the physiology of the senses.\nWe then become aware that _two different kinds or grades must be\ndistinguished in our becoming conscious of a sensation_. The lower\ngrade of this consciousness is that in which the influence of the\nsensation in question makes itself felt only in the conceptions we\nform of external things and processes, and assists in determining\nthem. This can take place without our needing, or indeed being\nable, to ascertain to what particular part of our sensations we owe\nthis or that circumstance in our perceptions. In this case we will\nsay that the impression of the sensation in question is _perceived\nsynthetically_. The second higher grade is when we immediately\ndistinguish the sensation in question as an existing part of the\nsum of the sensations excited in us. We will say, then, that the\nsensation is _perceived analytically_. The two cases must be carefully\ndistinguished from each other.\"[428]\nBy the sensation being perceived synthetically, Helmholtz means that\nit is not discriminated at all, but only felt in a mass with other\nsimultaneous sensations. That it _is_ felt there he thinks is proved\nby the fact that our _judgment_ of the total will change if anything\noccurs to alter the _outer cause_ of the sensation.[429] The following\npages from an earlier edition show what the concrete cases of synthetic\nperception and what those of analytic perception are wont to be:\n\"In the use of our senses, practice and experience play a much larger\npart than we ordinarily suppose. Our sensations are in the first\ninstance important only in so far as they enable us to judge rightly\nof the world about us; and our practice in discriminating between them\nusually goes only just far enough to meet this end. We are, however,\ntoo much disposed to think that we must be immediately conscious of\nevery ingredient of our sensations. This natural prejudice is due\nto the fact that we are indeed conscious, immediately and without\neffort, of everything in our sensations which has a bearing upon those\npractical purposes, for the sake of which we wish to know the outer\nworld. Daily and hourly, during our whole life, we keep our senses in\ntraining for this end exclusively, and for its sake our experiences\nare accumulated. But even within the sphere of these sensations, which\ndo correspond to outer things, training and practice make themselves\nfelt. It is well known how much finer and quicker the painter is in\ndiscriminating colors and illuminations than one whose eye is not\ntrained in these matters; how the musician and the musical-instrument\nmaker perceive with ease and certainty differences of pitch and tone\nwhich for the ear of the layman do not exist; and how even in the\ninferior realms of cookery and wine-judging it takes a long habit of\ncomparing to make a master. But more strikingly still is seen the\neffect of practice when we pass to sensations which depend only on\ninner conditions of our organs, and which, not corresponding at all to\nouter things or to their effects upon us, are therefore of no value\nin giving us information about the outer world. The physiology of the\nsense-organs has, in recent times, made us acquainted with a number\nof such phenomena, discovered partly in consequence of theoretic\nspeculations and questionings, partly by individuals, like Goethe and\nPurkinje, specially endowed by nature with talent for this sort of\nobservation. These so-called subjective phenomena are extraordinarily\nhard to find; and when they are once found, special aids for the\nattention are almost always required to observe them. It is usually\nhard to notice the phenomenon again even when one knows already the\ndescription of the first observer. The reason is that we are not only\nunpractised in singling out these subjective sensations, but that\nwe are, on the contrary, most thoroughly trained in abstracting our\nattention from them, because they would only hinder us in observing\nthe outer world. Only when their intensity is so strong as actually to\nhinder us in observing the outer world do we begin to notice them; or\nthey may sometimes, in dreaming and delirium, form the starting point\nof hallucinations.\n\"Let me give a few well-known cases, taken from physiological optics,\nas examples. Every eye probably contains _musc\u00e6 volitantes_, so\ncalled; these are fibres, granules, etc., floating in the vitreous\nhumor, throwing their shadows on the retina, and appearing in the\nfield of vision as little dark moving spots. They are most easily\ndetected by looking attentively at a broad, bright, blank surface\nlike the sky. Most persons who have not had their attention expressly\ncalled to the existence of these figures are apt to notice them for\nthe first time when some ailment befalls their eyes and attracts\ntheir attention to the subjective state of these organs. The usual\ncomplaint then is that the _musc\u00e6 volitantes_ came in with the malady;\nand this often makes the patients very anxious about these harmless\nthings, and attentive to all their peculiarities. It is then hard work\nto make them believe that these figures have existed throughout all\ntheir previous life, and that all healthy eyes contain them. I knew\nan old gentleman who once had occasion to cover one of his eyes which\nhad accidentally become diseased, and who was then in no small degree\nshocked at finding that his other eye was totally blind; with a sort\nof blindness, moreover, which must have lasted years, and yet he never\nwas aware of it.\n\"Who, besides, would believe without performing the appropriate\nexperiments, that when one of his eyes is closed there is a great gap,\nthe so-called 'blind spot,' not far from the middle of the field of\nthe open eye, in which he sees nothing at all, but which he fills out\nwith his imagination? Mariotte, who was led by theoretic speculations\nto discover this phenomenon, awakened no small surprise when he\nshowed it at the court of Charles II. of England. The experiment was\nat that time repeated with many variations, and became a fashionable\namusement. The gap is, in fact, so large that seven full moons\nalongside of each other would not cover its diameter, and that a\nman's face 6 or 7 feet off disappears within it. In our ordinary use\nof vision this great hole in the field fails utterly to be noticed;\nbecause our eyes are constantly wandering, and the moment an object\ninterests us we turn them full upon it. So it follows that the object\nwhich at any actual moment excites our attention never happens to\nfall upon this gap, and thus it is that we never grow conscious of\nthe blind spot in the field. In order to notice it, we must first\npurposely rivet our gaze upon one object and then move about a second\nobject in the neighborhood of the blind spot, striving meanwhile to\n_attend_ to this latter without moving the direction of our gaze\nfrom the first object. This runs counter to all our habits, and is\ntherefore a difficult thing to accomplish. With some people it is\neven an impossibility. But only when it is accomplished do we see the\nsecond object vanish and convince ourselves of the existence of this\ngap.\n\"Finally, let me refer to the double images of ordinary binocular\nvision. Whenever we look at a point with both eyes, all objects on\nthis side of it or beyond it appear double. It takes but a moderate\neffort of observation to ascertain this fact; and from this we may\nconclude that we have been seeing the far greater part of the external\nworld double all our lives, although numbers of persons are unaware\nof it, and are in the highest degree astonished when it is brought\nto their attention. As a matter of fact, we never _have_ seen in\nthis double fashion any particular object upon which our attention\nwas directed at the time; for upon such objects we always converge\nboth eyes. In the habitual use of our eyes, our attention is always\nwithdrawn from such objects as give us double images at the time; this\nis the reason why we so seldom learn that these images exist. In order\nto find them we must set our attention a new and unusual task; we must\nmake it explore the lateral parts of the field of vision, not, as\nusual, to find what objects are there, but to analyze our sensations.\nThen only do we notice this phenomenon.[430]\n\"The same difficulty which is found in the observation of subjective\nsensations to which no external object corresponds is found also in\nthe analysis of compound sensations which correspond to a single\nobject. Of this sort are many of our sensations of sound. When the\nsound of a violin, no matter how often we hear it, excites over and\nover again in our ear the same sum of partial tones, the result is\nthat our feeling of this sum of tones ends by becoming for our mind a\nmere sign for the voice of the violin. Another combination of partial\ntones becomes the sensible sign of the voice of a clarionet, etc. And\nthe oftener any such combination is heard, the more accustomed we grow\nto perceiving it as an integral total, and the harder it becomes to\nanalyze it by immediate observation. I believe that this is one of the\nprincipal reasons why the analysis of the notes of the human voice in\nsinging is relatively so difficult. Such fusions of many sensations\ninto what, to conscious perception, seems a simple whole, abound in\nall our senses.\n\"Physiological optics affords other interesting examples. The\nperception of the bodily form of a near object comes about through the\ncombination of two diverse pictures which the eyes severally receive\nfrom it, and whose diversity is due to the different position of each\neye, altering the perspective view of what is before it. Before the\ninvention of the stereoscope this explanation could only be assumed\nhypothetically; but it can now be proved at any moment by the use of\nthe instrument. Into the stereoscope we insert two flat drawings,\nrepresenting the two perspective views of the two eyes, in such a\nmanner that each eye sees its own view in the proper place; and we\nobtain, in consequence, the perception of a single extended solid, as\ncomplete and vivid as if we had the real object before us.\n\"Now we can, it is true, by shutting one eye after the other and\nattending to the point, recognize the difference in the pictures--at\nleast when it is not too small. But, for the stereoscopic perception\nof solidity, pictures suffice whose difference is so extraordinarily\nslight as hardly to be recognized by the most careful comparison;\nand it is certain that, in our ordinary careless observing of bodily\nobjects, we never dream that the perception is due to two perspective\nviews fused into one, because it is an entirely different kind of\nperception from that of either flat perspective view by itself. It\nis certain, therefore, that two different sensations of our two eyes\nfuse into a third perception entirely different from either. Just\nas partial tones fuse into the perception of a certain instrument's\nvoice; and just as we learn to separate the partial tones of a\nvibrating string by pinching a nodal point and letting them sound\nin isolation; so we learn to separate the images on the two eyes by\nopening and closing them alternately.\n\"There are other much more complex instances of the way in which\nmany sensations may combine to serve as the basis of a quite simple\nperception. When, for example we perceive an object in a certain\n_direction_, we must somehow be impressed by the fact that certain\nof our optic nerve-fibres, and no others, are impressed by its\nlight. Furthermore, we must rightly judge the position of our eyes\nin our head, and of our head upon our body, by means of feelings in\nour eye-muscles and our neck-muscles respectively. If any of these\nprocesses is disturbed we get a false perception of the object's\nposition. The nerve-fibres can be changed by a prism before the eye;\nor the eyeball's position changed by pressing the organ towards one\nside; and such experiments show that, for the simple seeing of the\nposition of an object, sensations of these two sorts must concur. But\nit would be quite impossible to gather this directly from the sensible\nimpression which the object makes. Even when we have made experiments\nand convinced ourselves in every possible manner that such must be\nthe fact, it still remains hidden from our immediate introspective\nobservation.\n\"These examples\" [of 'synthetic perception,' perception in which each\ncontributory sensation is felt _in_ the whole, and is a co-determinant\nof what the whole shall be, but does not attract the attention to its\nseparate self] \"may suffice to show the vital part which the direction\nof attention and practice in observing play in sense-perception. To\napply this now to the ear. The ordinary task which our ear has to\nsolve when many sounds assail it at once is to discern the voices of\nthe several sounding bodies or instruments engaged; beyond this it has\nno objective interest in analyzing. We wish to know, when many men\nare speaking together, what each one says, when many instruments and\nvoices combine, which melody is executed by each. Any deeper analysis,\nsuch as that of each separate note into its partial tones (although\nit might be performed by the same means and faculty of hearing as the\nfirst analysis) would tell us nothing new about the sources of sound\nactually present, but might lead us astray as to their number. For\nthis reason we confine our attention in analyzing a mass of sound to\nthe several instruments' voices, and expressly abstain, as it were,\nfrom discriminating the elementary components of the latter. In this\nlast sort of discrimination we are as unpractised as we are, on the\ncontrary, well trained in the former kind.\"[431]\nAfter all we have said, no comment seems called for upon these\ninteresting and important facts and reflections of Helmholtz.\nREACTION-TIME AFTER DISCRIMINATION.\nThe _time required for discrimination_ has been made a subject of\nexperimental measurement. Wundt calls it _Unterscheidungszeit_. His\nsubjects (whose simple reaction-time--see p. 85 ff.--had previously\nbeen determined) were required to make a movement, always the same,\nthe instant they discerned _which_ of two or more signals they\nreceived. The exact time of the signal and that of the movement were\nautomatically registered by a galvanic chronoscope. The particular\nsignal to be received was unknown in advance, and the excess of time\noccupied by those reactions in which its character had first to be\ndiscerned, over the simple reaction-time, measured, according to Wundt,\nthe time required for the act of discrimination. It was found longer\nwhen four different signals were irregularly used than when only\ntwo were used. In the former case it averaged, for three observers\nrespectively (the signals being the sudden appearance of a black or of\na white object),\n0.050 sec.;\n0.047 sec.\n0.079 sec.\nIn the latter case, a red and a green signal being added to the former\nones, it became, for the same observers,\n0.157;\n0.073;\n0.132.[432]\nLater, in Wundt's Laboratory, Herr Tischer made many careful\nexperiments after the same method, where the facts to be discriminated\nwere the different degrees of loudness in the sound which served as\na signal. I subjoin Herr Tischer's table of results, explaining that\neach vertical column after the first gives the average results obtained\nfrom a distinct individual, and that the figure in the first column\nstands for the number of possible loudnesses that might be expected in\nthe particular series of reactions made. The times are expressed in\nthousandths of a second.\n2 |  6    |  8.5  |  10.75 |  10.7 |  33   |  53\n3 |  10   |  14.4 |  19.9  |  22.7 |  58.5 |  57.8\n4 |  16.7 |  20.8 |  29    |  29.1 |  75   |  84\n5 |  25.6 |  31   |  ...   |  40.1 |  95.5 |  138[433]\nThe interesting points here are the great individual variations, and\nthe rapid way in which the time for discrimination increases with the\nnumber of possible terms to discriminate. The individual variations are\nlargely due to want of practice in the particular task set, but partly\nalso to discrepancies in the psychic process. One gentleman said,\nfor example, that in the experiments with three sounds, he kept the\nimage of the middle one ready in his mind, and compared what he heard\nas either louder, lower, or the same. His discrimination among three\npossibilities became thus very similar to a discrimination between\ntwo.[434]\nMr. J. M. Cattell found he could get no results by this method,[435]\nand reverted to one used by observers previous to Wundt and which\nWundt had rejected. This is the _einfache Wahlmethode_, as Wundt calls\nit. The reacter awaits the signal and reacts if it is of one sort, but\nomits to act if it is of another sort. The reaction thus occurs after\ndiscrimination; the motor impulse cannot be sent to the hand until the\nsubject knows what the signal is. The nervous impulse, as Mr. Cattell\nsays, must probably travel to the cortex and excite changes there,\ncausing in consciousness the perception of the signal. These changes\noccupy the time of discrimination (or perception-time, as it is called\nby Mr. C.) But _then_ a nervous impulse must descend from the cortex\nto the lower motor centre which stands primed and ready to discharge;\nand this, as Mr. C. says, gives a will-time as well. The total\nreaction-time thus includes both 'will-time' and 'discrimination-time.'\nBut as the centrifugal and centripetal processes occupying these two\ntimes respectively are probably about the same, and the time used\nin the cortex is about equally divided between the perception of\nthe signal and the preparation of the motor discharge, if we divide\nit equally between perception (discrimination) and volition, the\nerror cannot be great.[436] We can moreover change the nature of the\nperception without altering the will-time, and thus investigate with\nconsiderable thoroughness the length of the perception-time.\nGuided by these principles, Prof. Cattell found the time required for\ndistinguishing a white signal from no signal to be, in two observers:\n0.030 sec. and 0.050 sec;\nthat for distinguishing one color from another was similarly:\n0.100 and 0.110;\nthat for distinguishing a certain color from ten other colors:\n0.105 and 0.117;\nthat for distinguishing the letter A in ordinary print from the letter\nZ:\n0.142 and 0.137;\nthat for distinguishing a given letter from all the rest of the alphabet\n(not reacting until that letter appeared)\n0.119 and 0.116;\nthat for distinguishing a word from any of twenty-five other words, from\n0.118 sec. to 0.158 sec.\nThe difference depending on the length of the words and the familiarity\nof the language to which they belonged.\nProf. Cattell calls attention to the fact that the time for\ndistinguishing a word is often but little more than that for\ndistinguishing a letter:\n\"We do not, therefore, distinguish separately the letters of which a\nword is composed, but the word as a whole. The application of this in\nteaching children to read is evident.\"\nHe also finds a great difference in the time with which various letters\nare distinguished, E being particularly bad.[437]\nI have, in describing these experiments, followed the example of\nprevious writers and spoken as if the process by which the nature of\nthe signal determines the reaction were identical with the ordinary\nconscious process of discriminative perception and volition. I am\nconvinced, however, that this is not the case; and that although the\nresults are the same, the form of consciousness is quite different.\nThe reader will remember my contention (_supra_, p. 90 ff.) that the\nsimple reaction-time (usually supposed to include a conscious process\nof perceiving) really measures nothing but a reflex act. Anyone who\nwill perform reactions with discrimination will easily convince\nhimself that the process here also is far more like a reflex, than\nlike a deliberate, operation. I have made, with myself and students,\na large number of measurements where the signal expected was in one\nseries a touch _somewhere_ on the skin of the back and head, and in\nanother series a spark _somewhere_ in the field of view. The hand\nhad to move as quickly as possible towards the place of the touch\nor the spark. It did so infallibly, and sensibly instantly; whilst\nboth place and movement seemed to be _perceived_ only a moment\nlater, in memory. These experiments were undertaken for the express\npurpose of ascertaining whether the movement at the sight of the\nspark was discharged _immediately_ by the visual perception, or\nwhether a 'motor-idea' had to intervene between the perception of the\nspark and the reaction.[438] The first thing that was manifest to\nintrospection was that no perception or idea of _any_ sort preceded\nthe reaction. It jumped of itself, whenever the signal came; and\nperception was retrospective. We must suppose, then, that the state of\neager expectancy of a certain definite range of possible discharges,\ninnervates a whole set of paths in advance, so that when a particular\nsensation comes it is drafted into its appropriate motor outlet too\nquickly for the perceptive process to be aroused. In the experiments\nI describe, the conditions were most favorable for rapidity, for the\nconnection between the signals and their movements might almost be\ncalled innate. It is instinctive to move the hand towards a thing seen\nor a skin-spot touched. But where the movement is _conventionally_\nattached to the signal, there would be more chance for delay, and\nthe amount of practice would then determine the speed. This is well\nshown in Tischer's results, quoted on p. 524, where the most practised\nobserver, Tischer himself, reacted in one eighth of the time needed\nby one of the others.[439] But what all investigators have aimed to\ndetermine in these experiments is the _minimum_ time. I trust I have\nsaid enough to convince the student that this minimum time by no means\nmeasures what we consciously know as discrimination. It only measures\nsomething which, under the experimental conditions, leads to a similar\nresult. But it is the bane of psychology to suppose that where results\nare similar, processes must be the same. Psychologists are too apt to\nreason as geometers would, if the latter were to say that the diameter\nof a circle is the same thing as its semi-circumference, because,\nforsooth, they terminate in the same two points.[440]\nTHE PERCEPTION OF LIKENESS.\nThe perception of likeness is practically very much bound up with\nthat of difference. That is to say, the only differences we note _as_\ndifferences, and estimate quantitatively, and arrange along a scale,\nare those comparatively limited differences which we find between\nmembers of a common genus. The force of gravity and the color of this\nink are things it never occurred to me to compare until now that I\nam casting about for examples of the incomparable. Similarly the\nelastic quality of this india-rubber band, the comfort of last night's\nsleep, the good that can be done with a legacy, these are things too\ndiscrepant to have ever been compared ere now. Their relation to each\nother is less that of difference than of mere logical negativity. To be\nfound _different_, things must as a rule have some commensurability,\nsome aspect in common, which suggests the possibility of their\nbeing treated in the same way. This is of course not a theoretic\nnecessity--for any distinction may be called a 'difference,' if one\nlikes--but a practical and linguistic remark.\nThe _same things, then, which arouse the perception of difference\nusually arouse that of resemblance also_. And the analysis of them,\nso as to define wherein the difference and wherein the resemblance\nrespectively consists, is called _comparison_. If we start to deal with\nthe things as simply the same or alike, we are liable to be surprised\nby the difference. If we start to treat them as merely different, we\nare apt to discover how much they are alike. _Difference, commonly so\ncalled, is thus between species of a genus._ And the faculty by which\nwe perceive the resemblance upon which the genus is based, is just\nas ultimate and inexplicable a mental endowment as that by which we\nperceive the differences upon which the species depend. There is a\nshock of likeness when we pass from one thing to another which in the\nfirst instance we merely discriminate numerically, but, at the moment\nof bringing our attention to bear, perceive to be _similar_ to the\nfirst; just as there is a shock of difference when we pass between two\ndissimilars.[441] The objective extent of the likeness, just like that\nof the difference, determines the magnitude of the shock. The likeness\nmay be so evanescent, or the basis of it so habitual and little liable\nto be attended to, that it will escape observation altogether. Where,\nhowever, we find it, there we make a genus of the things compared; and\ntheir discrepancies and incommensurabilities in other respects can\nthen figure as the _differential_ of so many species. As 'thinkables'\nor 'existents' even the smoke of a cigarette and the worth of a\ndollar-bill are comparable--still more so as 'perishables,' or as\n'enjoyables.'\nMuch, then, of what I have said of difference in the course of this\nchapter will apply, with a simple change of language, to resemblance as\nwell. We go through the world, carrying on the two functions abreast,\ndiscovering differences in the like, and likenesses in the different.\nTo abstract the _ground_ of either difference or likeness (where it\nis not ultimate) demands an analysis of the given objects into their\nparts. So that all that was said of the dependence of analysis upon a\npreliminary separate acquaintance with the character to be abstracted,\nand upon its having varied concomitants, finds a place in the\npsychology of resemblance as well as in that of difference.\nBut when all is said and done about the conditions which favor our\nperception of resemblance and our abstraction of its ground, the\ncrude fact remains, that _some people are far more sensitive to\nresemblances, and far more ready to point out wherein they consist,\nthan others are_. They are the wits, the poets, the inventors, the\nscientific men, the practical geniuses. _A native talent for perceiving\nanalogies_ is reckoned by Prof. Bain, and by others before and after\nhim, as _the leading fact in genius of every order_. But as this\nchapter is already long, and as the question of genius had better wait\ntill Chapter XXII, where its practical consequences can be discussed at\nthe same time, I will say nothing more at present either about it or\nabout the faculty of noting resemblances. If the reader feels that this\nfaculty is having small justice done it at my hands, and that it ought\nto be wondered at and made much more of than has been done in these\nlast few pages, he will perhaps find some compensation when that later\nchapter is reached. I think I emphasize it enough when I call it one of\nthe ultimate foundation-pillars of the intellectual life, the others\nbeing Discrimination, Retentiveness, and Association.\nTHE MAGNITUDE OF DIFFERENCES.\nOn page 489 I spoke of differences being greater or less, and of\ncertain groups of them being susceptible of a linear arrangement\nexhibiting serial _increase_. A series whose terms grow more and more\ndifferent from the starting point is one whose terms grow less and\nless like it. They grow more and more like it if you read them the\nother way. So that likeness and unlikeness to the starting point are\nfunctions inverse to each other, of the position of any term in such a\nseries.\nProfessor Stumpf introduces the word _distance_ to denote the position\nof a term in any such series. The less like is the term, the more\ndistant it is from the starting point. The ideally regular series of\nthis sort would be one in which the distances--the steps of resemblance\nor difference--between all pairs of adjacent terms were equal. This\nwould be an evenly gradated series. And it is an interesting fact in\npsychology that we are able, in many departments of our sensibility,\nto arrange the terms without difficulty in this evenly gradated way.\nDifferences, in other words, between diverse pairs of terms, _a_ and\n_b_, for example, on the one hand, and _c_ and _d_ on the other,[442]\ncan be judged equal or diverse in amount. The distances from one term\nto another in the series are equal. Linear magnitudes and musical notes\nare perhaps the impressions which we easiest arrange in this way.\nNext come shades of light or color, which we have little difficulty\nin arranging by steps of difference of sensibly equal value. Messrs.\nPlateau and Delb\u0153uf have found it fairly easy to determine what shade\nof gray will be judged by every one to hit the exact middle between a\ndarker and a lighter shade.[443]\nHow now do we so readily recognize the equality of two differences\nbetween different pairs of terms? or, more briefly, how do we recognize\nthe _magnitude_ of a difference at all? Prof. Stumpf discusses this\nquestion in an interesting way;[444] and comes to the conclusion that\nour feeling for the size of a difference, and our perception that\nthe terms of two diverse pairs are equally or unequally distant from\neach other, can be explained by no simpler mental process, but, like\nthe shock of difference itself, must be regarded as for the present\nan unanalyzable endowment of the mind. This acute author rejects in\nparticular the notion which would make our judgment of the distance\nbetween two sensations depend upon our _mentally traversing the\nintermediary steps_. We may of course do so, and may often find it\nuseful to do so, as in musical intervals, or figured lines, But we need\nnot do so; and nothing more is really _required_ for a comparative\njudgment of the amount of a 'distance' than three or four impressions\nbelonging to a common kind.\nThe vanishing of all perceptible difference between two numerically\ndistinct things makes them _qualitatively the same_ or _equal_.\nEquality, or _qualitative_ (as distinguished from numerical)\n_identity_, is thus nothing but the _extreme degree of likeness_.[445]\nWe saw above (p. 492) that some persons consider that the difference\nbetween two objects is constituted of two things, viz., their absolute\nidentity in certain respects, _plus_ their absolute non-identity in\nothers. We saw that this theory would not apply to all cases (p. 493).\nSo here any theory which would base likeness on identity, and not\nrather identity on likeness, must fail. It is supposed perhaps, by\nmost people, that two resembling things owe their resemblance to their\nabsolute identity in respect of some attribute or attributes, combined\nwith the absolute non-identity of the rest of their being. This, which\nmay be true of compound things, breaks down when we come to simple\nimpressions.\n\"When we compare a deep, a middle, and a high note, e.g. _C, f_ sharp,\n_a'''_, we remark immediately that the first is less like the third\nthan the second is. The same would be true of _c d e_ in the same\nregion of the scale. Our very calling one of the notes a 'middle'\nnote is the expression of a judgment of this sort. But where here is\nthe identical and where the non-identical part? We cannot think of\nthe overtones; for the first-named three notes have none in common,\nat least not on musical instruments. Moreover, we might take simple\ntones, and still our judgment would be unhesitatingly the same,\nprovided the tones were not chosen too close together.... Neither can\nit be said that the identity consists in their all being sounds, and\nnot a sound, a smell, and a color, respectively. For this identical\nattribute comes to each of them in equal measure, whereas the first,\nbeing less like the third than the second is, ought, on the terms\nof the theory we are criticising, to have less of the identical\nquality.... It thus appears impracticable to define all possible cases\nof likeness as partial identity _plus_ partial disparity; and it is\nvain to seek in all cases for identical elements.\"[446]\nAnd as all compound resemblances are based on simple ones like these,\nit follows that likeness _\u00fcberhaupt_ must not be conceived as a special\ncomplication of identity, but rather that identity must be conceived as\na special degree of likeness, according to the proposition expressed at\nthe outset of the paragraph that precedes. Likeness and difference are\nultimate relations perceived. As a matter of fact, no two sensations,\nno two objects of all those we know, are in scientific rigor identical.\nWe call those of them identical whose difference is unperceived.\nOver and above this we have a _conception_ of absolute sameness, it\nis true, but this, like so many of our conceptions (cf. p. 508), is\nan ideal construction got by following a certain direction of serial\nincrease to its maximum supposable extreme. It plays an important\npart, among other permanent meanings possessed by us, in our ideal\nintellectual constructions. But it plays no part whatever in explaining\npsychologically how we perceive likenesses between simple things.\nTHE MEASURE OF DISCRIMINATIVE SENSIBILITY.\nIn 1860, Professor G. T. Fechner of Leipzig, a man of great learning\nand subtlety of mind, published two volumes entitled 'Psychophysik,'\ndevoted to establishing and explaining a law called by him the\npsychophysic law, which he considered to express the deepest and most\nelementary relation between the mental and the physical worlds. It is\na formula for the connection between the amount of our sensations and\nthe amount of their outward causes. Its simplest expression is, that\nwhen we pass from one sensation to a stronger one of the same kind, the\nsensations increase proportionally to the logarithms of their exciting\ncauses. Fechner's book was the starting point of a new department of\nliterature, which it would be perhaps impossible to match for the\nqualities of thoroughness and subtlety, but of which, in the humble\nopinion of the present writer, the proper psychological outcome is just\n_nothing_. The psychophysic law controversy has prompted a good many\nseries of observations on sense-discrimination, and has made discussion\nof them very rigorous. It has also cleared up our ideas about the best\nmethods for getting average results, when particular observations vary;\nand beyond this it has done nothing; but as it is a chapter in the\nhistory of our science, some account of it is here due to the reader.\nFechner's train of thought has been popularly expounded a great many\ntimes. As I have nothing new to add, it is but just that I should quote\nan existing account. I choose the one given by Wundt in his Vorlesungen\n\u00fcber Menschen und Thierseele, 1863, omitting a good deal:\n\"How much stronger or weaker one sensation is than another, we are\nnever able to say. Whether the sun be a hundred or a thousand times\nbrighter than the moon, a cannon a hundred or a thousand times louder\nthan a pistol, is beyond our power to estimate. The natural measure of\nsensation which we possess enables us to judge of the equality, of the\n'more' and of the 'less,' but not of 'how many times more or less.'\nThis natural measure is, therefore, as good as no measure at all,\nwhenever it becomes a question of accurately ascertaining intensities\nin the sensational sphere. Even though it may teach us in a general\nway that with the strength of the outward physical stimulus the\nstrength of the concomitant sensation waxes or wanes, still it leaves\nus without the slightest knowledge of whether the sensation varies in\nexactly the same proportion as the stimulus itself, or at a slower\nor a more rapid rate. In a word, we know by our natural sensibility\nnothing of the _law_ that connects the sensation and its outward cause\ntogether. To find this law we must first find an exact measure for the\nsensation itself; we must be able to say: A stimulus of strength _one_\nbegets a sensation of strength _one_; a stimulus of strength _two_\nbegets a sensation of strength _two_, or _three_, or _four_, etc. But\nto do this we must first know what a sensation two, three, or four\ntimes greater than another signifies....\n\"Space magnitudes we soon learn to determine exactly because we only\nmeasure one space against another. The measure of mental magnitudes\nis far more difficult.... But the problem of measuring the magnitude\nof _sensations_ is the first step in the bold enterprise of making\nmental magnitudes altogether subject to exact measurement.... Were\nour whole knowledge limited to the fact that the sensation rises when\nthe stimulus rises, and falls when the latter falls, much would not\nbe gained. But even immediate unaided observation teaches us certain\nfacts which, at least in a general way, suggest the law according to\nwhich the sensations vary with their outward cause.\n\"Every one knows that in the stilly night we hear things unnoticed in\nthe noise of day. The gentle ticking of the clock, the air circulating\nthrough the chimney, the cracking of the chairs in the room, and a\nthousand other slight noises, impress themselves upon our ear. It is\nequally well known that in the confused hubbub of the streets, or the\nclamor of a railway, we may lose not only what our neighbor says to\nus, but even not hear the sound of our own voice. The stars which are\nbrightest at night are invisible by day; and although we see the moon\nthen, she is far paler than at night. Everyone who has had to deal\nwith weights knows that if to a pound in the hand a second pound be\nadded, the difference is immediately felt; whilst if it be added to a\nhundredweight, we are not aware of the difference at all....\n\"The sound of the clock, the light of the stars, the pressure of\nthe pound, these are all _stimuli_ to our senses, and stimuli whose\noutward amount remains the same. What then do these experiences teach?\nEvidently nothing but this, that one and the same stimulus, according\nto the circumstances under which it operates, will be felt either\nmore or less intensely, or not felt at all. Of what sort now is the\nalteration in the circumstances, upon which this alteration in the\nfeeling may depend? On considering the matter closely we see that it\nis everywhere of one and the same kind. The tick of the clock is a\nfeeble stimulus for our auditory nerve, which we hear plainly when\nit is alone, but not when it is added to the strong stimulus of the\ncarriage-wheels and other noises of the day. The light of the stars is\na stimulus to the eye. But if the stimulation which this light exerts\nbe added to the strong stimulus of daylight, we feel nothing of it,\nalthough we feel it distinctly when it unites itself with the feebler\nstimulation of the twilight. The pound-weight is a stimulus to our\nskin, which we feel when it joins itself to a preceding stimulus of\nequal strength, but which vanishes when it is combined with a stimulus\na thousand times greater in amount.\n\"We may therefore lay it down as a general rule that a stimulus,\nin order to be felt, may be so much the smaller if the already\npre-existing stimulation of the organ is small, but must be so much\nthe larger, the greater the pre-existing stimulation is. From\nthis in a general way we can perceive the connection between the\nstimulus and the feeling it excites. At least thus much appears,\nthat the law of dependence is not as simple a one as might have been\nexpected beforehand. The simplest relation would obviously be that\nthe sensation should increase in identically the same ratio as the\nstimulus, thus that if a stimulus of strength _one_ occasioned a\nsensation _one_, a stimulus of _two_ should occasion sensation _two_,\nstimulus _three_, sensation _three_, etc. But if this simplest of\nall relations prevailed, a stimulus added to a pre-existing strong\nstimulus ought to provoke as great an increase of feeling as if it\nwere added to a pre-existing weak stimulus; the light of the stars\ne.g., ought to make as great an addition to the daylight as it does\nto the darkness of the nocturnal sky. This we know not to be the\ncase: the stars are invisible by day, the addition they make to our\nsensation then is unnoticeable, whereas the same addition to our\nfeeling of the twilight is very considerable indeed. So it is clear\nthat the strength of the sensations does not increase in proportion\nto the amount of the stimuli, but more slowly. And now comes the\nquestion, in what proportion does the increase of the sensation\ngrow less as the increase of the stimulus grows greater. To answer\nthis question, every-day experiences do not suffice. We need exact\nmeasurements both of the amounts of the various stimuli, and of the\nintensity of the sensations themselves.\n\"How to execute these measurements, however, is something which daily\nexperience suggests. To measure the strength of sensations is, as we\nsaw, impossible; we can only measure the difference of sensations.\nExperience showed us what very unequal differences of sensation\nmight come from equal differences of outward stimulus. But all these\nexperiences expressed themselves in one kind of fact, that the same\ndifference of stimulus could in one case be felt, and in another\ncase not felt at all--a pound felt if added to another pound, but\nnot if added to a hundred-weight.... We can quickest reach a result\nwith our observations if we start with an arbitrary strength of\nstimulus, notice what sensation it gives us, and then _see how much\nwe can increase the stimulus without making the sensation seem to\nchange_. If we carry out such observations with stimuli of varying\nabsolute amounts, we shall be forced to choose in an equally varying\nway the amounts of addition to the stimulus which are capable of\ngiving us a just barely perceptible feeling of _more_. A light, to be\njust perceptible in the twilight need not be near as bright as the\nstarlight; it must be far brighter to be just perceived during the\nday. If now we institute such observations for all possible strengths\nof the various stimuli, and note for each strength the amount of\naddition of the latter required to produce a barely perceptible\nalteration of sensation, we shall have a series of figures in which is\nimmediately expressed the law according to which the sensation alters\nwhen the stimulation is increased....\"\nObservations according to this method are particularly easy to make\nin the spheres of light-, sound-, and pressure-sensation.... Beginning\nwith the latter case,\n\"We find a surprisingly simple result. The barely sensible addition to\nthe original weight _must stand exactly in the same proportion to it_,\nbe the _same fraction_ of it, no matter what the absolute value may be\nof the weights on which the experiment is made.... As the average of\na number of experiments, this fraction is found to be about 1/3; that\nis, no matter what pressure there may already be made upon the skin,\nan increase or a diminution of the pressure will be _felt_, as soon\nas the added or subtracted weight amounts to one third of the weight\noriginally there.\"\nWundt then describes how differences may be observed in the muscular\nfeelings, in the feelings of heat, in those of light, and in those of\nsound; and he concludes his seventh lecture (from which our extracts\nhave been made) thus:\n\"So we have found that all the senses whose stimuli we are enabled to\nmeasure accurately, obey a uniform law. However various may be their\nseveral delicacies of discrimination, _this_ holds true of all, that\n_the increase of the stimulus necessary to produce an increase of the\nsensation bears a constant ratio to the total stimulus_. The figures\nwhich express this ratio in the several senses may be shown thus in\ntabular form:\nSensation of light,   1/100\nMuscular sensation,   1/17\nFeeling of pressure,  1/3\nFeeling of warmth,    1/3\nFeeling of sound,     1/3\n\"These figures are far from giving as accurate a measure as might be\ndesired. But at least they are fit to convey a general notion of the\nrelative discriminative susceptibility of the different senses....\nThe important law which gives in so simple a form the relation of the\nsensation to the stimulus that calls it forth was first discovered\nby the physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber to obtain in special cases.\nGustav Theodor Fechner first proved it to be a law for all departments\nof sensation. Psychology owes to him the first comprehensive\ninvestigation of sensations from a physical point of view, the first\nbasis of an exact Theory of Sensibility.\"\nSo much for a general account of what Fechner calls Weber's law. The\n'exactness' of the theory of sensibility to which it leads consists in\nthe supposed fact that it gives the means of representing sensations\nby numbers. The _unit_ of any kind of sensation will be that increment\nwhich, when the stimulus is increased, we can just barely perceive\nto be added. The total number of units which any given sensation\ncontains will consist of the total number of such increments which may\nbe perceived in passing from no sensation of the kind to a sensation\nof the present amount. We cannot get at this number directly, but we\ncan, now that we know Weber's law, get at it by means of the physical\nstimulus of which it is a function. For if we know how much of the\nstimulus it will take to give a barely perceptible sensation, and then\nwhat percentage of addition to the stimulus will constantly give a\nbarely perceptible increment to the sensation, it is at bottom only a\nquestion of compound interest to compute, out of the total amount of\nstimulus which we may be employing at any moment, the number of such\nincrements, or, in other words, of sensational units to which it may\ngive rise. This number bears the same relation to the total stimulus\nwhich the time elapsed bears to the capital plus the compound interest\naccrued.\nTo take an example: If stimulus A just falls short of producing a\nsensation, and if _r_ be the percentage of itself which must be added\nto it to get a sensation which is barely perceptible--call this\nsensation 1--then we should have the series of sensation-numbers\ncorresponding to their several stimuli as follows:\nSensation 0 = stimulus A;\nSensation 1 = stimulus A (1 + r);\nSensation 2 = stimulus A (1 + r)^2;\nSensation 3 = stimulus A (1 + r)^3;\n.....\nSensation _n_ = stimulus A (1 + r)^_n_.\nThe sensations here form an arithmetical series, and the stimuli a\ngeometrical series, and the two series correspond term for term. Now,\nof two series corresponding in this way, the terms of the arithmetical\none are called the logarithms of the terms corresponding in rank to\nthem in the geometrical series. A conventional arithmetical series\nbeginning with zero has been formed in the ordinary logarithmic tables,\nso that we may truly say (assuming our facts to be correct so far)\nthat the _sensations vary in the same proportion as the logarithms of\ntheir respective stimuli_. And we can thereupon proceed to compute\nthe number of units in any given sensation (considering the unit of\nsensation to be equal to the just perceptible increment above zero,\nand the unit of stimulus to be equal to the increment of stimulus\n_r_, which brings this about) by multiplying the logarithm of the\nstimulus by a constant factor which must vary with the particular kind\nof sensation in question. If we call the stimulus R, and the constant\nfactor C, we get the formula\nS = C log R,\nwhich is what Fechner calls the _psychophysischer Maasformel_. This, in\nbrief, is Fechner's reasoning, as I understand it.\nThe _Maasformel_ admits of mathematical development in various\ndirections, and has given rise to arduous discussions into which I\nam glad to be exempted from entering here, since their interest is\nmathematical and metaphysical and not primarily psychological at\nall.[447] I must say a word about them metaphysically a few pages later\non. Meanwhile it should be understood that no human being, in any\ninvestigation into which sensations entered, has ever used the numbers\ncomputed in this or any other way in order to test a theory or to reach\na new result. The whole notion of measuring sensations numerically,\nremains in short a mere mathematical speculation about possibilities,\nwhich has never been applied to practice. Incidentally to the\ndiscussion of it, however, a great many particular facts have been\ndiscovered about discrimination which merit a place in this chapter.\nIn the first place it is found, when the difference of two sensations\napproaches the limit of discernibility, that at one moment we discern\nit and at the next we do not. There are accidental fluctuations in\nour inner sensibility which make it impossible to tell just what the\nleast discernible increment of the sensation is without taking the\naverage of a large number of appreciations. These _accidental errors_\nare as likely to increase as to diminish our sensibility, and are\neliminated in such an average, for those above and those below the line\nthen neutralize each other in the sum, and the normal sensibility,\nif there be one (that is, the sensibility due to constant causes as\ndistinguished from these accidental ones), stands revealed. The best\nway of getting at the average sensibility has been very minutely worked\nover. Fechner discussed three methods, as follows:\n(1) _The Method of just-discernible Differences._ Take a standard\nsensation _S_, and add to it until you distinctly feel the addition\n_d_; then subtract from _S_ + _d_ until you distinctly feel the effect\nof the subtraction;[448] call the difference here _d'_. The least\ndiscernible difference sought is _d_ + _d'_/2; and the ratio of this\nquantity to the original _S_ (or rather to _S_ + _d_ - _d'_) is what\nFechner calls the difference-threshold. _This difference-threshold\nshould be a constant fraction_ (no matter what is the size of _S_) _if\nWeber's law holds universally true._ The difficulty in applying this\nmethod is that we are _so often in doubt_ whether anything has been\nadded to _S_ or not. Furthermore, if we simply take the smallest _d_\nabout which we are _never_ in doubt or in error, we certainly get our\nleast discernible difference larger than it ought theoretically to\nbe.[449]\nOf course the _sensibility_ is small when the least discernible\ndifference is large, and _vice vers\u00e2_; in other words, it and the\ndifference-threshold are inversely related to each other.\n(2) _The Method of True and False Cases._ A sensation which is barely\ngreater than another will, on account of accidental errors in a long\nseries of experiments, sometimes be judged equal, and sometimes\nsmaller; i.e., we shall make a certain number of false and a certain\nnumber of true judgments about the difference between the two\nsensations which we are comparing.\n\"But the larger this difference is, the more the number of the\ntrue judgments will increase at the expense of the false ones; or,\notherwise expressed, the nearer to unity will be the fraction whose\ndenominator represents the whole number of judgments, and whose\nnumerator represents those which are true. If _m_ is a ratio of this\nnature, obtained by comparison of two stimuli, _A_ and _B_, we may\nseek another couple of stimuli, _a_ and _b_, which when compared will\ngive the same ratio of true to false cases.\"[450]\nIf this were done, and the ratio of _a_ to _b_ then proved to be equal\nto that of _A_ to _B_, that would prove that pairs of small stimuli\nand pairs of large stimuli may affect our discriminative sensibility\nsimilarly so long as the ratio of the components to each other within\neach pair is the same. In other words, it would in so far forth prove\nthe Weberian law. Fechner made use of this method to ascertain his\nown power of discriminating differences of weight, recording no less\nthan 24,576 separate judgments, and computing as a result that his\ndiscrimination for the same relative increase of weight was less good\nin the neighborhood of 500 than of 300 grams, but that after 500 grams\nit improved up to 3000, which was the highest weight he experimented\nwith.\n(3) _The Method of Average Errors_ consists in taking a standard\nstimulus and then trying to make another one of the same sort exactly\nequal to it. There will in general be an error whose amount is large\nwhen the discriminative sensibility called in play is small, and _vice\nvers\u00e2_. The sum of the errors, no matter whether they be positive or\nnegative, divided by their number, gives the average error. This,\nwhen certain corrections are made, is assumed by Fechner to be the\n'reciprocal' of the discriminative sensibility in question. It should\nbear a constant proportion to the stimulus, no matter what the absolute\nsize of the latter may be, if Weber's law hold true.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThese methods deal with just perceptible differences. Delb\u0153uf and Wundt\nhave experimented with larger differences by means of what Wundt calls\nthe _M\u00e9thode der mittleren Abstufungen_, and what we may call\n(4) _The Method of Equal-appearing Intervals._ This consists in so\narranging three stimuli in a series that the intervals between the\nfirst and the second shall appear equal to that between the second\nand the third. At first sight there seems to be no direct logical\nconnection between this method and the preceding ones. By them we\ncompare equally _perceptible_ increments of stimulus in different\nregions of the latter's scale; but by the fourth method we compare\nincrements which strike us as equally _big_. But what we can but just\nnotice as an increment need not appear always of the same bigness after\nit is noticed. On the contrary, it will appear much bigger when we are\ndealing with stimuli that are already large.\n(5) The method of doubling the _stimulus_ has been employed by Wundt's\ncollaborator, Merkel, who tried to make one stimulus seem just double\nthe other, and then measured the objective relation of the two. The\nremarks just made apply also to this case.\n*       *       *       *       *\nSo much for the methods. The results differ in the hands of different\nobservers. I will add a few of them, and will take first the\n_discriminative sensibility to light_.\nBy the first method, Volkmann, Aubert, Masson, Helmholtz, and Kr\u00e4pelin\nfind figures varying from 1/3 or 1/4 to 1/195 of the original\nstimulus. The smaller fractional increments are discriminated when the\nlight is already fairly strong, the larger ones when it is weak or\nintense. That is, the discriminative sensibility is low when weak or\noverstrong lights are compared, and at its best with a certain medium\nillumination. It is thus a function of the light's intensity; but\nthroughout a certain range of the latter it keeps constant, and _in so\nfar forth_ Weber's law is verified for light. Absolute figures cannot\nbe given, but Merkel, by method 1, found that Weber's law held good for\nstimuli (measured by his arbitrary unit) between 96 and 4096, beyond\nwhich intensity no experiments were made.[451] K\u00f6nig and Brodhun\nhave given measurements by method 1 which cover the most extensive\nseries, and moreover apply to six different colors of light. These\nexperiments (performed in Helmholtz's laboratory, apparently,) ran from\nan intensity called 1 to one which was 100,000 times as great. From\nintensity 2000 to 20,000 Weber's law held good; below and above this\nrange discriminative sensibility declined. The increment discriminated\nhere was the same for all colors of light, and lay (according to the\ntables) between 1 and 2 per cent of the stimulus.[452] Delb\u0153uf had\nverified Weber's law for a certain range of luminous intensities by\nmethod 4; that is, he had found that the objective intensity of a light\nwhich appeared midway between two others was really the geometrical\nmean of the latter's intensities. But A. Lehmann and afterwards\nNeiglick, in Wundt's laboratory, found that effects of contrast played\nso large a part in experiments performed in this way that Delb\u0153uf's\nresults could not be held conclusive. Merkel, repeating the experiments\nstill later, found that the objective intensity of the light which we\njudge to stand midway between two others neither stands midway nor is\na geometric mean. The discrepancy from both figures is enormous, but\nis least large from the midway figure or arithmetical mean of the two\nextreme intensities.[453] Finally, the stars have from time immemorial\nbeen arranged in 'magnitudes' supposed to differ by equal-seeming\nintervals. Lately their intensities have been gauged photometrically,\nand the comparison of the subjective with the objective series has been\nmade. Prof. J. Jastrow is the latest worker in this field. He finds,\ntaking Pickering's Harvard photometric tables as a basis, that the\nratio of the average intensity of each 'magnitude' to that below it\ndecreases as we pass from lower to higher magnitudes, showing a uniform\ndeparture from Weber's law, if the method of equal-appearing intervals\nbe held to have any direct relevance to the latter.[454]\n_Sounds_ are less delicately discriminated in intensity than lights.\nA certain difficulty has come from disputes as to the measurement of\nthe objective intensity of the stimulus. Earlier inquiries made the\nperceptible increase of the stimulus to be about 1/3 of the latter.\nMerkel's latest results of the method of just perceptible differences\nmake it about 3/10 for that part of the scale of intensities during\nwhich Weber's law holds good, which is from 20 to 5000 of M.'s\narbitrary unit.[455] Below this the fractional increment must be\nlarger. Above it no measurements were made.\nFor _pressure and muscular sense_ we have rather divergent results.\nWeber found by the method of just-perceptible differences that persons\ncould distinguish an increase of weight of 1/40 when the two weights\nwere successively lifted by the same hand. It took a much larger\nfraction to be discerned when the weights were laid on a hand which\nrested on the table. He seems to have verified his results for only\ntwo pairs of differing weights,[456] and on this founded his 'law.'\nExperiments in Hering's laboratory on lifting 11 weights, running\nfrom 250 to 2750 grams showed that the least perceptible increment\nvaried from 1/21 for 250 grams to 1/114 for 2500. For 2750 it rose to\n1/98 again. Merkel's recent and very careful experiments, in which\nthe finger pressed down the beam of a balance counterweighted by from\n25 to 8020 grams, showed that between 200 and 2000 grams a constant\nfractional increase of about 1/13 was felt when there was no movement\nof the finger, and of about 1/19 when there was movement. Above and\nbelow these limits the discriminative power grew less. It was greater\nwhen the pressure was upon one square millimeter of surface than when\nit was upon seven.[457]\n_Warmth and taste_ have been made the subject of similar investigations\nwith the result of verifying something like Weber's law. The\ndetermination of the unit of stimulus is, however, so hard here\nthat I will give no figures. The results may be found in Wundt's\nPhysiologische Psychologie, 3d Ed. i, 370-2.\n_The discrimination of lengths by the eye_ has been found also to obey\nto a certain extent Weber's law. The figures will all be found in G. E.\nM\u00fcller, _op. cit._ part ii, chap. x, to which the reader is referred.\nProfessor Jastrow has published some experiments, made by what may be\ncalled a modification of the method of equal-appearing differences,\non our estimation of the length of sticks, by which it would seem\nthat the estimated intervals and the real ones are directly and not\nlogarithmically proportionate to each other. This resembles Merkel's\nresults by that method for weights, lights, and sounds, and differs\nfrom Jastrow's own finding about star-magnitudes.[458]\n*       *       *       *       *\nIf we look back over these facts as a whole, we see that it is not any\nfixed amount added to an impression that makes us notice an increase\nin the latter, but that the amount depends on how large the impression\nalready is. The amount is expressible as a certain fraction of the\nentire impression to which it is added; and it is found that the\nfraction is a well-nigh constant figure throughout an entire region\nof the scale of intensities of the impression in question. Above and\nbelow this region the fraction increases in value. This is _Weber's\nlaw_, which in so far forth expresses an empirical generalization of\npractical importance, without involving any theory whatever or seeking\nany absolute measure of the sensations themselves. It is in the\n_Theoretic Interpretation of Weber's Law_\nthat Fechner's originality exclusively consists, in his assumptions,\nnamely, 1) that the just-perceptible increment is the _sensation-unit_,\nand is in all parts of the scale the same (mathematically expressed,\n\u0394_s_= const.); 2) that all our sensations consist of sums of these\nunits; and finally, 3) that the reason why it takes a constant\nfractional increase of the stimulus to awaken this unit lies in\nan ultimate law of the connection of mind with matter, whereby\nthe quantities of our feelings are related logarithmically to\nthe quantities of their objects. Fechner seems to find something\ninscrutably sublime in the existence of an ultimate 'psychophysic' law\nof this form.\nThese assumptions are all peculiarly fragile. To begin with, the\n_mental fact_ which in the experiments corresponds to the increase\nof the stimulus is not an _enlarged sensation_, but a _judgment that\nthe sensation is enlarged_. What Fechner calls the 'sensation' is\nwhat appears to the mind as the _objective phenomenon_ of light,\nwarmth, weight, sound, impressed part of body, etc. Fechner tacitly\nif not openly assumes that such a _judgment of increase_ consists\nin the simple fact that an _increased number_ of sensation-units\nare present to the mind; and that the judgment is thus itself a\nquantitatively bigger mental thing when it judges large differences,\nor differences between large terms, than when it judges small ones.\nBut these ideas are really absurd. The hardest sort of judgment, the\njudgment which strains the attention most (if _that_ be any criterion\nof the judgment's 'size'), is that about the _smallest_ things and\ndifferences. But really it has no meaning to talk about one judgment\nbeing bigger than another. And even if we leave out judgments and\ntalk of sensations only, we have already found ourselves (in Chapter\nVI) quite unable to read any clear meaning into the notion that they\nare masses of units combined. To introspection, our feeling of pink\nis surely not a portion of our feeling of scarlet; nor does the light\nof an electric arc seem to contain that of a tallow-candle in itself.\nCompound _things_ contain parts; and one such thing may have twice\nor three times as many parts as another. But when we take a simple\nsensible quality like light or sound, and say that there is now twice\nor thrice as much of it present as there was a moment ago, although\nwe seem to mean the same thing as if we were talking of compound\nobjects, we really mean something different. We mean that if we were\nto arrange the various possible degrees of the quality in a scale of\nserial increase, the _distance, interval_, or _difference_ between the\nstronger and the weaker specimen before us would seem about as great\nas that between the weaker one and the beginning of the scale. _It is\nthese_ RELATIONS, _these_ DISTANCES, _which we are measuring and not\nthe composition of the qualities themselves_, as Fechner thinks. Whilst\nif we turn to objects which _are_ divisible, surely a big object may be\nknown in a little thought. Introspection shows moreover that in most\nsensations a new _kind_ of feeling invariably accompanies our judgment\nof an increased impression; and this is a fact which Fechner's formula\ndisregards.[459]\nBut apart from these _a priori_ difficulties, and even supposing that\nsensations did consist of added units, Fechner's assumption that all\n_equally perceptible_ additions are _equally great_ additions is\nentirely arbitrary. Why might not a small addition to a small sensation\nbe as _perceptible_ as a large addition to a large one? In this case\nWeber's law would apply not to the additions themselves, but only to\ntheir perceptibility. Our _noticing_ of a difference of units in two\nsensations would depend on the latter being in a fixed ratio. But\nthe _difference itself_ would depend directly on that between their\nrespective stimuli. So many units added to the stimulus, so many\nadded to the sensation, and if the stimulus grew in a certain ratio,\nin exactly the same ratio would the sensation also grow, though its\n_perceptibility_ grew according to the logarithmic law.[460]\nIf _A_ stand for the smallest difference which _we perceive_, then we\nshould have, instead of the formula \u0394_s_ = const., which is Fechner's,\nthe formula \u0394_s_/_s_ = const., a formula which interprets all the\n_facts_ of Weber's law, in an entirely different theoretic way from\nthat adopted by Fechner.[461]\nThe entire superstructure which Fechner rears upon the facts is thus\nnot only seen to be arbitrary and subjective, but in the highest degree\nimprobable as well. The departures from Weber's law in regions where\nit does not obtain, he explains by the compounding with it of other\nunknown laws which mask its effects. As if _any_ law could not be\nfound in _any_ set of phenomena, provided one have the wit to invent\nenough other coexisting laws to overlap and neutralize it! The whole\noutcome of the discussion, so far as Fechner's theories are concerned,\nis indeed _nil. Weber's law alone remains true, as an empirical\ngeneralization of fair extent:_ What we add to a large stimulus\nwe notice less than what we add to a small one, unless it happen\n_relatively to the stimulus_ to be as great.\n_Weber's law is probably purely physiological._\nOne can express this state of things otherwise by saying that the\nwhole of the stimulus does not seem to be effective in giving us the\nperception of 'more,' and the simplest interpretation of such a state\nof things would be _physical_. The loss of effect would take place in\nthe nervous system. If our feelings resulted from a condition of the\nnerve-molecules which it grew ever more difficult for the stimulus\nto increase, our feelings would naturally grow at a slower rate than\nthe stimulus itself. An ever larger part of the latter's work would\ngo to overcoming the resistances, and an ever smaller part to the\nrealization of the feeling-bringing state. Weber's law would thus be a\nsort of _law of friction_ in the neural machine.[462] Just how these\ninner resistances and frictions are to be conceived is a speculative\nquestion. Delb\u0153uf has formulated them as fatigue; Bernstein and Ward,\nas irradiations. The latest, and probably the most 'real,' hypothesis\nis that of Ebbinghaus, who supposes that the intensity of sensation\ndepends on the _number_ of neural molecules which are disintegrated in\nthe unit of time. There are only a certain number at any time which are\n_capable_ of disintegrating; and whilst most of these are in an average\ncondition of instability, some are almost stable and some already near\nto decomposition. The smallest stimuli affect these latter molecules\nonly; and as they are but few, the sensational effect from adding a\ngiven quantity of stimulus _at first_ is relatively small. Medium\nstimuli affect the majority of the molecules, but affect fewer and\nfewer in proportion as they have already diminished their number. The\nlatest additions to the stimuli find all the medium molecules already\ndisintegrated, and only affect the small relatively indecomposable\nremainder, thus giving rise to increments of feeling which are\ncorrespondingly small. (Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, 45, 113.)\nIt is surely in some such way as this that Weber's law is to be\ninterpreted, if it ever is. The Fechnerian _Maasformel_ and the\nconception of it as an ultimate 'psychophysic law' will remain an 'idol\nof the den,' if ever there was one. Fechner himself indeed was a German\n_Gelehrter_ of the ideal type, at once simple and shrewd, a mystic and\nan experimentalist, homely and daring, and as loyal to facts as to his\ntheories. But it would be terrible if even such a dear old man as this\ncould saddle our Science forever with his patient whimsies, and, in\na world so full of more nutritious objects of attention, compel all\nfuture students to plough through the difficulties, not only of his own\nworks, but of the still drier ones written in his refutation. Those who\ndesire this dreadful literature can find it; it has a 'disciplinary\nvalue;' but I will not even enumerate it in a foot-note. The only\namusing part of it is that Fechner's critics should always feel bound,\nafter smiting his theories hip and thigh and leaving not a stick of\nthem standing, to wind up by saying that nevertheless to him belongs\nthe _imperishable glory_, of first formulating them and thereby turning\npsychology into an _exact science_,\n\"'And everybody praised the duke\nWho this great fight did win.'\n'But what good came of it at last?'\nQuoth little Peterkin.\n'Why, that I cannot tell,' said he,\n'But 'twas a famous victory!'\"\nFOOTNOTES:\n[406] Human Understanding, ii, xi, 1, 2.\n[407] Analysis, vol. i, p. 71.\n[408] The Senses and the Intellect, page 411.\n[409] Essays Philosophical and Theological: First Series, pp. 268-273.\n[410] Montgomery in 'Mind,' x, 527.

It seems to me that in his particular reasoning he forgets the\nultimate units of the mind-stuff theory. I cannot find the completed\ninfinite to be one of the obstacles to belief in this theory, although\nI fully accept Stumpf's general reasoning, and am only too happy to\nfind myself on the same side with such an exceptionally clear thinker.\nThe strictures by Wahle in the Vierteljsch. f. wiss. Phil. seem to\nme to have no force, since the writer does not discriminate between\nresemblance of things obviously compound and that of things sensibly\nsimple.\n[412] The _belief that the causes_ of effects felt by us to differ\nqualitatively are facts which differ only in quantity (e.g. that blue\nis caused by so many ether-waves, and yellow by a smaller number)\nmust not be confounded with the feeling that the effects differ\nquantitatively themselves.\n[413] Herr G. H. Schneider, in his youthful pamphlet (Die\nUnterscheidung, 1877) has tried to show that there are no\npositively existent elements of sensibility, no substantive\nqualities between which differences obtain, but that the terms\nwe call such, the sensations, are but sums of differences, loci\nor starting points whence many directions of difference proceed.\n'_Unterschiedsempfindungs-Complexe_' are what he calls them. This\nabsurd carrying out of that 'principle of relativity' which we shall\nhave to mention in Chapter XVII may serve as a counterpoise to the\nmind-stuff theory, which says that there are nothing but substantive\nsensations, and denies the existence of relations of difference between\nthem at all.\n[414] Cf. Stumpf, Tonpsychologie, i, 121, and James Ward, Mind, i, 464.\n[415] The ordinary treatment of this is to call it the result of the\n_fusion_ of a lot of sensations, in themselves separate. This is pure\nmythology, as the sequel will abundantly show.\n[416] \"We often begin to be dimly aware of a difference in a sensation\nor group of sensations, before we can assign any definite character\nto that which differs. Thus we detect a strange or foreign ingredient\nor flavor in a familiar dish, or of tone in a familiar tune, and\nyet are wholly unable for a while to say what the intruder is like.\nHence perhaps discrimination may be regarded as the earliest and\nmost primordial mode of intellectual activity.\" (Sully: Outlines of\nPsychology, p. 142. _Cf._ also G. H. Schneider: Die Unterscheidung, pp.\n9-10.)\n[417] In cases where the difference is slight, we may need, as\npreviously remarked, to get the dying phase of _n_ as well as of _m_\nbefore _n-different-from-m_ is distinctly felt. In that case the\ninevitably successive feelings (as far as we can sever what is so\ncontinuous) would be four, _m, difference, n, n-different-from-m_. This\nslight additional complication alters not a whit the essential features\nof the case.\n[418] Analysis. J. S. Mill's ed., ii, 17. Cf. also pp. 12, 14.\n[419] There is only one obstacle, and that is our inveterate tendency\nto believe that where two things or qualities are compared, it\n_must_ be that exact duplicates of both have got into the mind and\nhave matched themselves against each other there. To which the first\nreply is the empirical one of \"Look into the mind and see.\" When I\nrecognize a weight which I now lift as _inferior_ to the one I just\nlifted; when, with my tooth now aching, I perceive the pain to be\n_less_ intense than it was a minute ago; the two things in the mind\nwhich are compared would, by the authors I criticise, be admitted to\nbe an actual sensation and an image in the memory. An image in the\nmemory, by general consent of these same authors, is admitted to be a\nweaker thing than a sensation. Nevertheless it is in these instances\njudged stronger; that is, an object supposed to be known only in so\nfar forth as this image represents it, is judged stronger. Ought not\nthis to shake one's belief in the notion of separate representative\n'ideas' weighing themselves, or being weighed by the Ego, against each\nother in the mind? And let it not be said that what makes us judge the\nfelt pain to be weaker than the imagined one of a moment since is our\nrecollection of the _downward nature of the shock of difference_ which\nwe felt as we passed to the present moment from the one before it. That\nshock does undoubtedly have a different character according as it comes\nbetween terms of which the second diminishes or increases; and it may\nbe admitted that in cases Where the past term is doubtfully remembered,\nthe memory of the shock as _plus_ or _minus_, might sometimes enable us\nto establish a relation which otherwise we should not perceive. But one\ncould hardly expect the memory of this shock to overpower our actual\ncomparison of terms, both of which are _present_ (as are the image\nand the sensation in the case supposed), and make us judge the weaker\none to be the stronger.--And hereupon comes the second reply: Suppose\nthe mind does compare two realities by comparing two ideas of its own\nwhich represent them--what is gained? The same mystery is still there.\nThe ideas must still be _known_; and, as the attention in comparing\noscillates from one to the other, past must be known with present just\nas before. If you must end by simply saying that your 'Ego,' whilst\n_being_ neither the idea of _m_ nor the idea of _n_, yet knows and\ncompares both, why not allow your pulse of thought, which _is_ neither\nthe thing _m_ nor the thing _n_, to know and compare both directly?\n'Tis but a question of how to _name_ the facts least artificially.\nThe egoist _explains_ them, by naming them as an Ego 'combining' or\n'synthetizing' two ideas, no more than we do by naming them a pulse of\nthought knowing two facts.\n[420] I fear that few will be converted by my words, so obstinately\ndo thinkers of all schools refuse to admit the unmediated function of\n_knowing a thing_, and so incorrigibly do they substitute _being the\nthing_ for it. E.g., in the latest utterance of the spiritualistic\nphilosophy (Bowne's Introduction to Psychological Theory, 1887,\npublished only three days before this writing) one of the first\nsentences which catch my eye is this: \"What remembers? The spiritualist\nsays, the soul remembers; it abides across the years and the flow of\nthe body, and _gathering up its past, carries it with it_\" (p. 28).\nWhy, for heaven's sake, O Bowne, cannot you say '_knows it_'? If there\nis anything our soul does _not_ do to its past, it is to carry it with\nit.\n[421] Sensations of Tone, 2d English Ed., p. 65.\n[422] Psychology, i, 345.\n[423] A Budget of Paradoxes, p. 380.\n[424] The explanation I offer presupposes that a difference too faint\nto have any direct effect in the way of making the mind notice it _per\nse_ will nevertheless be strong enough to keep its 'terms' from calling\nup identical associates. It seems probable from many observations that\nthis is the case. All the facts of 'unconscious' inference are proofs\nof it. We say a painting 'looks' like the work of a certain artist,\nthough we cannot name the characteristic differenti\u00e6. We see by a\nman's face that he is sincere, though we can give no definite reason\nfor our faith. The facts of sense-perception quoted from Helmholtz\na few pages below will be additional examples. Here is another good\none, though it will perhaps be easier understood after reading the\nchapter on Space-perception than now. Take two stereoscopic slides and\nrepresent on each half-slide a pair of spots, _a_ and _b_, but make\ntheir distances such that the _a_'s are equidistant on both slides,\nwhilst the _b_'s are nearer together on slide 1 than on slide 2. Make\nmoreover the distance _ab = ab'''_ and the distance _ab' = ab''_. Then\nlook successively at the two slides stereoscopically, so that the\n_a_'s in both are directly fixated (that is fall on the two fove\u00e6, or\ncentres of distinctest vision). The _a_'s will then appear single, and\nso probably will the _b_'s. But the now single-seeming _b_ on slide 1\nwill look nearer, whilst that on slide 2 will look farther than the\n_a_. But, if the diagrams are rightly drawn, _b_ and _b'''_ must affect\n'identical' spots, spots equally far to the right of the fovea, _b_ in\nthe left eye and _b'''_ in the right eye. The same is true of _b'_ and\n_b''_. Identical spots are spots whose sensations cannot possibly be\ndiscriminated as such. Since in these two observations, however, they\ngive rise to such opposite perceptions of distance, and prompt such\nopposite tendencies to movement (since in slide 1 we _converge_ in\nlooking from _a_ to _b_, whilst in slide 2 we _diverge_), it follows\nthat two processes which occasion feelings quite indistinguishable to\ndirect consciousness may nevertheless be each allied with disparate\nassociates both of a sensorial and of a motor kind. Cf. Donders, Archiv\nf. Ophthalmologie, Bd. 13 (1867).

J.\n[431] Tonempfindungen, Dritte Auflage, pp. 102-107.--The reader who\nhas assimilated the contents of our Chapter V, above, will doubtless\nhave remarked that the illustrious physiologist has fallen, in these\nparagraphs, into that sort of interpretation of the facts which\nwe there tried to prove erroneous. Helmholtz, however, is no more\ncareless than most psychologists in confounding together the object\nperceived, the organic conditions of the perception, and the sensations\nwhich _would_ be excited by the several parts of the object, or by\nthe several organic conditions, _provided_ they came into action\nseparately or were separately attended to, and in assuming that\nwhat is true of any one of these sorts of fact must be true of the\nother sorts also. If each organic condition or part of the object\nis there, its sensation, he thinks, must be there also, only in a\n'synthetic'--which is indistinguishable from what the authors whom we\nformerly reviewed called an 'unconscious'--state. I will not repeat\narguments sufficiently detailed in the earlier chapter (see especially\npp. 170-176), but simply say that what he calls the 'fusion of many\n_sensations_ into one' is really the production of one sensation by the\nco-operation of many _organic conditions_; and that what perception\nfails to discriminate (when it is 'synthetic') is not _sensations_\nalready existent but not singled out, but new objective _facts_, judged\ntruer than the facts already synthetically perceived--two views of the\nsolid body, many harmonic tones, instead of one view and one tone,\nstates of the eyeball-muscles thitherto unknown, and the like. These\nnew facts, when first discovered, are known in states of consciousness\nnever till that moment exactly realized before, states of consciousness\nwhich at the same time judge them to be determinations of the same\n_matter of fact_ which was previously realized. All that Helmholtz\nsays of the conditions which hinder and further analysis applies just\nas naturally to the analysis, through the advent of _new_ feelings, of\n_objects_ into their elements, as to the analysis of aggregate feelings\ninto elementary feelings supposed to have been hidden in them all the\nwhile.\nThe reader can himself apply this criticism to the following passages\nfrom Lotze and Stumpf respectively, which I quote because they are the\nablest expressions of the view opposed to my own. Both authors, it\nseems to me, commit the psychologist's fallacy, and allow their later\nknowledge of the things felt to be foisted into their account of the\nprimitive way of feeling them.\nLotze says: \"It is indubitable that the simultaneous assault of a\nvariety of different stimuli on different senses, or even on the same\nsense, puts us into a state of confused general feeling in which we\nare certainly not conscious of clearly distinguishing the different\nimpressions. Still it does not follow that in such a case we have a\npositive perception of an actual unity of the contents of our ideas,\narising from their mixture; our state of mind seems rather to consist\nin (1) the consciousness of our inability to separate what really has\nremained diverse, and (2) in the general feeling of the disturbance\nproduced in the economy of our body by the simultaneous assault of\nthe stimuli.... Not that the sensations melt into one another, but\nsimply that the act of distinguishing them is absent; and this again\ncertainly not so far that the fact of the difference remains entirely\nunperceived, but only so far as to prevent us from determining the\namount of the difference, and from apprehending other relations between\nthe different impressions. Anyone who is annoyed at one and the same\ntime by glowing heat, dazzling light, deafening noise, and an offensive\nsmell, will certainly not fuse these disparate sensations into a single\none with a single content which could be sensuously perceived; they\nremain for him in separation, and he merely finds it impossible to be\nconscious of one of them apart from the others. But, further, he will\nhave a feeling of discomfort--what I mentioned above as the _second_\nconstituent of his whole state. For every stimulus which produces in\nconsciousness a definite content of sensation is also a definite degree\nof disturbance, and therefore makes a call upon the forces of the\nnerves; and the sum of these little changes, which in their character\nas disturbances are not so diverse as the contents of consciousness\nthey give rise to, produce the general feeling which, added to the\ninability to distinguish, deludes us into the belief in an actual\nabsence of diversity in our sensations. It is only in some such way as\nthis, again, that I can imagine that state which is sometimes described\nas the beginning of our whole education, a state which in itself is\nsupposed to be simple, and to be afterwards divided into different\nsensations by an activity of separation. No activity of separation\nin the world could establish differences where no real diversity\nexisted; for it would have nothing to guide it to the places where it\nwas to establish them, or to indicate the width it was to give them.\"\n(Metaphysic, \u00a7 260, English translation.)\nStumpf writes as follows: \"Of coexistent sensations there are always\na large number undiscriminated in consciousness, or (if one prefer\nto call what is undiscriminated unconscious) in the soul. They\nare, however, not fused into a simple quality. When, on entering a\nroom, we receive sensations of odor and warmth together, without\nexpressly attending to either, the two qualities of sensation are\nnot, as it were, an entirely new simple quality, which first at the\nmoment in which attention analytically steps in _changes into_ smell\nand warmth.... In such cases we find ourselves in presence of an\nindefinable, unnamable total of feeling. And when, after successfully\nanalyzing this total, we call it back to memory, as it was in its\nunanalyzed state, and compare it with the elements we have found, the\nlatter (as it seems to me) may be recognized as real parts contained\nin the former, and the former seen to be their sum. So, for example,\nwhen we clearly perceive that the content of our sensation of oil\nof peppermint is partly a sensation of taste and partly one of\ntemperature.\" (Tonpsychologie, i, 107.)\nI should prefer to say that we perceive that objective fact, known to\nus as the peppermint taste, to contain those other objective facts\nknown as aromatic or sapid quality, and coldness, respectively. No\nground to suppose that the vehicle of this last very complex perception\nhas any identity with the earlier psychosis--least of all is contained\nin it.\n[432] Physiol.

He says: \"I apparently either distinguished\nthe impression and made the motion simultaneously, or if I tried to\navoid this by waiting until I had formed a distinct impression before\nI began to make the motion, I added to the simple reaction, not only a\nperception, but a volition.\"--Which remark may well confirm our doubts\nas to the strict _psychologic_ worth of any of these measurements.\n[436] Mind, xi, 379.\n[437] For other determinations of discrimination-time by this method\ncf. v.

The investigation was abandoned because it was\nfound impossible to narrow down the difference between the conditions\nof the sight-series and those of the touch-series, to nothing more than\nthe possible presence in the latter of the intervening motor-idea.\nOther disparities could not be excluded.\n[439] Tischer gives figures from quite unpractised individuals, which\nI have not quoted.

I have noticed a curious\nenlargement of certain 'distances' of difference under the influence\nof chloroform. The jingling of the bells on the horses of a horse-car\npassing the door, for example, and the rumbling of the vehicle itself,\nwhich to our ordinary hearing merge together very readily into a\n_quasi_-continuous body of sound, have seemed so far apart as to\nrequire a sort of mental facing in opposite directions to get from one\nto the other, as if they belonged in different worlds. I am inclined to\nsuspect, from certain data, that the ultimate philosophy of difference\nand likeness will have to be built upon experiences of intoxication,\nespecially by nitrous oxide gas, which lets us into intuitions the\nsubtlety whereof is denied to the waking state.

I have omitted, so as not to make my text\ntoo intricate, an extremely acute and conclusive paragraph, which I\nreproduce here: \"We may generalize: Wherever a number of sensible\nimpressions are apprehended _as a series_, there in the last instance\nmust perceptions of simple likeness be found. _Proof:_ Assume that\nall the terms of a series, e.g. the qualities of tone, _c d e f g_,\nhave something in common,--_no matter what it is_, call it _X_; then I\nsay that the differing parts of each of these terms must not only be\ndifferently constituted in each, but must _themselves form a series_,\nwhose existence is the ground for our apprehending the original terms\nin serial form. We thus get instead of the original series _a b c d\nef_ ... the equivalent series _X\u0251, X\u03b2, X\u0263_,... etc. What is gained?\nThe question immediately arises: How is _\u0251 \u03b2 \u0263_ known as a series?\nAccording to the theory, these elements must themselves be made up of a\npart common to all, and of parts differing in each, which latter parts\nform a new series, and so on _ad infinitum_, which is absurd.\"\n[447] The most important ameliorations of Fechner's formula are\nDelb\u0153uf's in his Recherches sur la Mesure des Sensations (1873), p. 35,\nand Elsas's in his pamphlet \u00dcber die Psychophysik (1886) p. 16.\n[448] Reversing the order is for the sake of letting the opposite\naccidental errors due to 'contrast' neutralize each other.\n[449] Theoretically it would seem that it ought to be equal to the sum\nof all the additions which we judge to be increases divided by the\ntotal number of judgments made.\n[450] J.

Already in the last chapter I\nhave had to invoke, in order to explain the improvement of certain\ndiscriminations by practice, the 'association' of the objects to be\ndistinguished, with other more widely differing ones. It is obvious\nthat the advance of our knowledge _must_ consist of both operations;\nfor objects at first appearing as wholes are analyzed into parts,\nand objects appearing separately are brought together and appear as\nnew compound wholes to the mind. Analysis and synthesis are thus\nthe incessantly alternating mental activities, a stroke of the one\npreparing the way for a stroke of the other, much as, in walking,\na man's two legs are alternately brought into use, both being\nindispensable for any orderly advance.\nThe manner in which trains of imagery and consideration follow each\nother through our thinking, the restless flight of one idea before\nthe next, the transitions our minds make between things wide as\nthe poles asunder, transitions which at first sight startle us by\ntheir abruptness, but which, when scrutinized closely, often reveal\nintermediating links of perfect naturalness and propriety--all this\nmagical, imponderable streaming has from time immemorial excited\nthe admiration of all whose attention happened to be caught by its\nomnipresent mystery. And it has furthermore challenged the race of\nphilosophers to banish something of the mystery by formulating the\nprocess in simpler terms. The problem which the philosophers have set\nthemselves is that of ascertaining _principles of connection_ between\nthe thoughts which thus appear to sprout one out of the other, whereby\ntheir peculiar succession or coexistence may be explained.\nBut immediately an ambiguity arises: which sort of connection is meant?\nconnection _thought-of_, or connection _between thoughts_? These are\ntwo entirely different things, and only in the case of one of them\nis there any hope of finding 'principles.' The jungle of connections\n_thought of_ can never be formulated simply. Every conceivable\nconnection may be thought of--of coexistence, succession, resemblance,\ncontrast, contradiction, cause and effect, means and end, genus and\nspecies, part and whole, substance and property, early and late, large\nand small, landlord and tenant, master and servant,--Heaven knows what,\nfor the list is literally inexhaustible. The only simplification which\ncould possibly be aimed at would be the reduction of the relations to\na smaller number of types, like those which such authors as Kant and\nRenouvier call the 'categories' of the understanding.[464] According as\nwe followed one category or another we should sweep, with our thought,\nthrough the world in this way or in that. And all the categories would\nbe logical, would be relations of reason. They would fuse the items\ninto a continuum. Were _this_ the sort of connection sought between one\nmoment of our thinking and another, our chapter might end here. For the\nonly summary description of these infinite possibilities of transition,\nis that they are all _acts of reason_, and that the mind proceeds from\none object to another by some rational path of connection. The trueness\nof this formula is only equalled by its sterility, for psychological\npurposes. Practically it amounts to simply referring the inquirer to\nthe relations between facts or things, and to telling him that his\nthinking follows them.\nBut as a matter of fact, his thinking only sometimes follows them,\nand these so-called 'transitions of reason' are far from being all\nalike reasonable. If pure thought runs all our trains, why should she\nrun some so fast and some so slow, some through dull flats and some\nthrough gorgeous scenery, some to mountain-heights and jewelled mines,\nothers through dismal swamps and darkness?--and run some off the track\naltogether, and into the wilderness of lunacy? Why do we spend years\nstraining after a certain scientific or practical problem, but all in\nvain--thought refusing to evoke the solution we desire? And why, some\nday, walking in the street with our attention miles away from that\nquest, does the answer saunter into our minds as carelessly as if it\nhad never been called for--suggested, possibly, by the flowers on the\nbonnet of the lady in front of us, or possibly by nothing that we can\ndiscover? If reason can give us relief then, why did she not do so\nearlier?\nThe truth must be admitted that thought works under conditions imposed\n_ab extra_. The great law of habit itself--that twenty experiences\nmake us recall a thing better than one, that long indulgence in error\nmakes right thinking almost impossible--seems to have no essential\nfoundation in reason. The business of thought is with truth--the number\nof experiences ought to have nothing to do with her hold of it; and she\nought by right to be able to hug it all the closer, after years wasted\nout of its presence. The contrary arrangements seem quite fantastic\nand arbitrary, but nevertheless are part of the very bone and marrow\nof our minds. Reason is only one out of a thousand possibilities in\nthe thinking of each of us. Who can count all the silly fancies, the\ngrotesque suppositions, the utterly irrelevant reflections he makes in\nthe course of a day? Who can swear that his prejudices and irrational\nbeliefs constitute a less bulky part of his mental furniture than\nhis clarified opinions? It is true that a presiding arbiter seems\nto sit aloft in the mind, and emphasize the better suggestions into\npermanence, while it ends by dropping out and leaving unrecorded the\nconfusion. But this is all the difference. The _mode of genesis_ of\nthe worthy and the worthless seems the same. The laws of our actual\nthinking, of the _cogitatum_, must account alike for the bad and the\ngood materials on which the arbiter has to decide, for wisdom and for\nfolly. The laws of the arbiter, of the _cogitandum_, of what we _ought_\nto think, are to the former as the laws of ethics are to those of\nhistory. Who but an Hegelian historian ever pretended that reason in\naction was _per se_ a sufficient explanation of the political changes\nin Europe?\n*       *       *       *       *\n_There are, then, mechanical conditions on which thought depends,\nand which,_ to say the least, _determine the order in which is\npresented the content or material for her comparisons, selections, and\ndecisions._ It is a suggestive fact that Locke, and many more recent\nContinental psychologists, have found themselves obliged to invoke a\nmechanical process to account for the _aberrations_ of thought, the\nobstructive preprocessions, the frustrations of reason. This they found\nin the law of habit, or what we now call Association by Contiguity.\nBut it never occurred to these writers that a process which could\ngo the length of actually producing some ideas and sequences in the\nmind might safely be trusted to produce others too; and that those\nhabitual associations which further thought may also come from the\nsame mechanical source as those which hinder it. Hartley accordingly\nsuggested habit as a sufficient explanation of all connections of our\nthoughts, and in so doing planted himself squarely upon the properly\npsychological aspect of the problem of connection, and sought to treat\nboth rational and irrational connections from a single point of view.\nThe problem which he essayed, however lamely, to answer, was that of\nthe connection between our psychic states considered purely as such,\nregardless of the objective connections of which they might take\ncognizance. How does a man come, after thinking of A, to think of B\nthe next moment? or how does he come to think A and B always together?\nThese were the phenomena which Hartley undertook to explain by cerebral\nphysiology. I believe that he was, in many essential respects, on the\nright track, and I propose simply to revise his conclusions by the aid\nof distinctions which he did not make.\nBut the whole historic doctrine of psychological association is tainted\nwith one huge error--that of the construction of our thoughts out of\nthe confounding of themselves together of immutable and incessantly\nrecurring 'simple ideas.' It is the cohesion of these which the\n'principles of association' are considered to account for. In Chapters\nVI and IX we saw abundant reasons for treating the doctrine of simple\nideas or psychic atoms as mythological; and, in all that follows, our\nproblem will be to keep whatever truths the associationist doctrine has\ncaught sight of without weighing it down with the untenable incumbrance\nthat the association is between 'ideas.'\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Association_, so far as the word stands for an _effect, is between_\nTHINGS THOUGHT OF--_it is_ THINGS, _not ideas, which are associated in\nthe mind._ We ought to talk of the association of _objects_, not of the\nassociation of _ideas_. And so far as association stands for a _cause_,\nit is between _processes in the brain_--it is these which, by being\nassociated in certain ways, determine what successive objects shall be\nthought. Let us proceed towards our final generalizations by surveying\nfirst a few familiar facts.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe laws of motor habit in the lower centres of the nervous system\nare disputed by no one. A series of movements repeated in a certain\norder tend to unroll themselves with peculiar ease in that order for\never afterward. Number one awakens number two, and that awakens number\nthree, and so on, till the last is produced. A habit of this kind\nonce become inveterate may go on automatically. And so it is with the\nobjects with which our thinking is concerned. With some persons each\nnote of a melody, heard but once, will accurately revive in its proper\nsequence. Small boys at school learn the inflections of many a Greek\nnoun, adjective, or verb, from the reiterated recitations of the upper\nclasses falling on their ear as they sit at their desks. All this\nhappens with no voluntary effort on their part and with no thought of\nthe spelling of the words. The doggerel rhymes which children use in\ntheir games, such as the formula\n\"Ana mana mona mike\nBarcelona bona strike,\"\nused for 'counting out,' form another familiar example of things heard\nin sequence cohering in the same order in the memory.\nIn touch we have a smaller number of instances, though probably every\none who bathes himself in a certain fixed manner is familiar with the\nfact that each part of his body over which the water is squeezed from\nthe sponge awakens a premonitory tingling consciousness in that portion\nof skin which is habitually the next to be deluged. Tastes and smells\nform no very habitual series in our experience. But even if they did,\nit is doubtful whether habit would fix the order of their reproduction\nquite so well as it does that of other sensations. In vision, however,\nwe have a sense in which the order of reproduced things is very nearly\nas much influenced by habit as is the order of remembered sounds.\nRooms, landscapes, buildings, pictures, or persons with whose look we\nare very familiar, surge up before the mind's eye with all the details\nof their appearance complete, so soon as we think of any one of their\ncomponent parts. Some persons, in reciting printed matter by heart,\nwill seem to see each successive word, before they utter it, appear in\nits order on an imaginary page. A certain chess-player, one of those\nheroes who train themselves to play several games at once blindfold,\nis reported to say that in bed at night after a match the games are\nplayed all over again before his mental eye, each board being pictured\nas passing in turn through each of its successive stages. In this case,\nof course, the intense previous voluntary strain of the power of visual\nrepresentation is what facilitated the fixed order of revival.\nAssociation occurs as amply between impressions of different senses as\nbetween homogeneous sensations. Seen things and heard things cohere\nwith each other, and with odors and tastes, in representation, in the\nsame order in which they cohered as impressions of the outer world.\nFeelings of contact reproduce similarly the sights, sounds, and tastes\nwith which experience has associated them. In fact, the 'objects' of\nour perception, as trees, men, houses, microscopes, of which the real\nworld seems composed, are nothing but clusters of qualities which\nthrough simultaneous stimulation have so coalesced that the moment one\nis excited actually it serves as a sign or cue for the idea of the\nothers to arise. Let a person enter his room in the dark and grope\namong the objects there. The touch of the matches will instantaneously\nrecall their appearance. If his hand comes in contact with an orange\non the table, the golden yellow of the fruit, its savor and perfume\nwill forthwith shoot through his mind. In passing the hand over the\nsideboard or in jogging the coal-scuttle with the foot, the large\nglossy dark shape of the one and the irregular blackness of the other\nawaken like a flash and constitute what we call the recognition of the\nobjects. The voice of the violin faintly echoes through the mind as the\nhand is laid upon it in the dark, and the feeling of the garments or\ndraperies which may hang about the room is not _understood_ till the\nlook correlative to the feeling has in each case been resuscitated.\nSmells notoriously have the power of recalling the other experiences in\nwhose company they were wont to be felt, perhaps long years ago; and\nthe voluminous emotional character assumed by the images which suddenly\npour into the mind at such a time forms one of the staple topics of\npopular psychologic wonder--\n\"Lost and gone and lost and gone!\nA breath, a whisper--some divine farewell--\nDesolate sweetness--far and far away.\"\nWe cannot hear the din of a railroad tram or the yell of its whistle,\nwithout thinking of its long, jointed appearance and its headlong\nspeed, nor catch a familiar voice in a crowd without recalling, with\nthe name of the speaker, also his face. But the most notorious and\nimportant case of the mental combination of auditory with optical\nimpressions originally experienced together is furnished by language.\nThe child is offered a new and delicious fruit and is at the same\ntime told that it is called a 'fig.' Or looking out of the window he\nexclaims, \"What a funny horse!\" and is told that it is a 'piebald'\nhorse. When learning his letters, the sound of each is repeated to him\nwhilst its shape is before his eye. Thenceforward, long as he may live,\nhe will never see a fig, a piebald horse, or a letter of the alphabet\nwithout the name which he first heard in conjunction with each clinging\nto it in his mind; and inversely he will never hear the name without\nthe faint arousal of the image of the object.[465]\nTHE RAPIDITY OF ASSOCIATION.\nReading exemplifies this kind of cohesion even more beautifully. It is\nan uninterrupted and protracted recall of sounds by sights which have\nalways been coupled with them in the past. I find that I can name six\nhundred letters in two minutes on a printed page. Five distinct acts\nof association between sight and sound (not to speak of all the other\nprocesses concerned) must then have occurred in each second in my mind.\nIn reading entire words the speed is much more rapid. Valentin relates\nin his Physiology that the reading of a single page of the proof,\ncontaining 2629 letters, took him 1 minute and 32 seconds. In this\nexperiment each letter was _understood_ in 1/28 of a second, but owing\nto the integration of letters into entire words, forming each a single\naggregate impression directly associated with a single acoustic image,\nwe need not suppose as many as 28 separate associations in a sound. The\nfigures, however, suffice to show with what extreme rapidity an actual\nsensation recalls its customary associates. Both in fact seem to our\nordinary attention to come into the mind at once.\nThe time-measuring psychologists of recent days have tried their\nhand at this problem by more elaborate methods. Galton, using a very\nsimple apparatus, found that the sight of an unforeseen word would\nawaken an associated 'idea' in about 5/6 of a second.[466] Wundt next\nmade determinations in which the 'cue' was given by single-syllabled\nwords called out by an assistant. The person experimented on had to\npress a key as soon as the sound of the word awakened an associated\nidea. Both word and reaction were chronographically registered, and\nthe total time-interval between the two amounted, in four observers,\nto 1.009, 0.896, 1.037, and 1.154 seconds respectively. From this the\nsimple physiological reaction-time and the time of merely identifying\nthe word's sound (the 'apperception-time,' as Wundt calls it) must be\nsubtracted, to get the exact time required for the associated idea\nto arise. These times were separately determined and subtracted. The\ndifference, called by Wundt the _association-time_, amounted, in the\nsame four persons, to 706, 723, 752, and 874 thousandths of a second\nrespectively.[467] The length of the last figure is due to the fact\nthat the person reacting (President G. S. Hall) was an American,\nwhose associations with German words would naturally be slower than\nthose of natives. The shortest association-time noted was when the\nword 'Sturm' suggested to Prof. Wundt the word 'Wind' in 0.341\nsecond.[468]--Finally, Mr. Cattell made some interesting observations\nupon the association-time between the look of letters and their names.\n\"I pasted letters,\" he says, \"on a revolving drum, and determined\nat what rate they could be read aloud as they passed by a slit in a\nscreen.\" He found it to vary according as one, or more than one letter,\nwas visible at a time through the slit, and gives half a second as\nabout the time which it takes to see and name a single letter seen\nalone.\n\"When two or more letters are always in view, not only do the\nprocesses of seeing and naming overlap, but while the subject is\nseeing one letter he begins to see the ones next following, and so\ncan read them more quickly. Of the nine persons experimented on, four\ncould read the letters faster when five were in view at once, but were\nnot helped by a sixth letter; three were not helped by a fifth, and\ntwo not by a fourth letter. This shows that while one idea is in the\ncentre, two, three, or four additional ideas may be in the background\nof consciousness. The second letter in view shortens the time about\n1/40, the third 1/60, the fourth 1/100, the fifth 1/200 sec.\n\"I find it takes about twice as long to read (aloud, as fast as\npossible) words which have no connection as words which make sentences\nand letters which have no connection as letters which make words.\nWhen the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the\nprocesses of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the\nsubject can recognize a whole group of words or letters, and by one\nwill-act choose the motions to be made in naming, so that the rate\nat which the words and letters are read is really only limited by\nthe maximum rapidity at which the speech-organs can be moved. As the\nresult of a large number of experiments, the writer found that he had\nread words not making sentences at the rate of 1/4 sec, words making\nsentences (a passage from Swift) at the rate of 1/8 sec., per word....\nThe rate at which a person reads a foreign language is proportional to\nhis familiarity with the language. For example, when reading as fast\nas possible the writer's rate was, English 138, French 167, German\n250, Italian 327, Latin 434, and Greek 484; the figures giving the\nthousandths of a second taken to read each word. Experiments made on\nothers strikingly confirm these results. The subject does not know\nthat he is reading the foreign language more slowly than his own; this\nexplains why foreigners seem to talk so fast. This simple method of\ndetermining a person's familiarity with a language might be used in\nschool examinations.\n\"The time required to see and name colors and pictures of objects was\ndetermined in the same way. The time was found to be about the same\n(over 1/2 sec.) for colors as for pictures, and about twice as long\nas for words and letters. Other experiments I have made show that we\ncan recognize a single color or picture in a slightly shorter time\nthan a word or letter, but take longer to name it. This is because, in\nthe case of words and letters, the association between the idea and\nname has taken place so often that the process has become automatic,\nwhereas in the case of colors and pictures we must by a voluntary\neffort choose the name.\"[469]\nIn later experiments Mr. Cattell studied the time for various\nassociations to be performed, the termini (i.e., cue and answer) being\nwords. A word in one language was to call up its equivalent in another,\nthe name of an author the tongue in which he wrote, that of a city the\ncountry in which it lay, that of a writer one of his works, etc. The\nmean variation from the average is very great in all these experiments;\nand the interesting feature which they show is the existence of\ncertain constant differences between associations of different sorts.\nThus:\nFrom _country_ to _city_,     Mr. C.'s time was 0.340 sec.\nFrom _season_ to _month_,     Mr. C.'s time was 0.399\nFrom _language_ to _author_,  Mr. C.'s time was 0.523\nFrom _author_ to _work_,      Mr. C.'s time was 0.596\nThe average time of two observers, experimenting on eight different\ntypes of association, was 0.420 and 0.436 sec. respectively.[470] The\nvery wide range of variation is undoubtedly a consequence of the fact\nthat the words used as cues, and the different types of association\nstudied, differ much in their degree of familiarity.\n\"For example, B is a teacher of mathematics; C has busied himself more\nwith literature. C knows quite as well as B that 7 + 5 = 12, yet he\nneeds 1/10 a second longer to call it to mind; B knows quite as well\nas C that Dante was a poet, but needs 1/20 of a second longer to think\nof it. Such experiments lay bare the mental life in a way that is\nstartling and not always gratifying.\"[471]\nTHE LAW OF CONTIGUITY.\nTime-determinations apart, the facts we have run over can all be summed\nup in the simple statement that _objects once experienced together tend\nto become associated in the imagination, so that when any one of them\nis thought of, the others are likely to be thought of also, in the same\norder of sequence or coexistence as before_. This statement we may name\nthe law of _mental association by contiguity_.[472]\nI preserve this name in order to depart as little as possible from\ntradition, although Mr. Ward's designation of the process as that of\nassociation by _continuity_[473] or Wundt's as that of _external_\nassociation (to distinguish it from the _internal_ association which\nwe shall presently learn to know under the name of association by\nsimilarity)[474] are perhaps better terms. Whatever we name the law,\nsince it expresses merely a phenomenon of mental _habit, the most\nnatural way of accounting for it is to conceive it as a result of\nthe laws of habit in the nervous system; in other words, it is to\nascribe it to a physiological cause._ If it be truly a law of those\nnerve-centres which co-ordinate sensory and motor processes together\nthat paths once used for coupling any pair of them are thereby made\nmore permeable, there appears no reason why the same law should not\nhold good of ideational centres and their coupling-paths as well.[475]\nParts of these centres which have once been in action together will\nthus grow so linked that excitement at one point will irradiate\nthrough the system. The chances of complete irradiation will be\nstrong in proportion as the previous excitements have been frequent,\nand as the present points excited afresh are numerous. If all points\nwere originally excited together, the irradiation may be sensibly\nsimultaneous throughout the system, when any single point or group\nof points is touched off. But where the original impressions were\nsuccessive--the conjugation of a Greek verb, for example--awakening\nnerve-tracts in a definite order, they will now, when one of them\nawakens, discharge into each other in that definite order and in no\nother way.\nThe reader will recollect all that has been said of increased tension\nin nerve-tracts and of the summation of stimuli (p. 82 ff.). We must\ntherefore suppose that in these ideational tracts as well as elsewhere,\nactivity may be awakened, in any particular locality, by the summation\ntherein of a number of tensions, each incapable alone of provoking\nan actual discharge. Suppose for example the locality M to be in\nfunctional continuity with four other localities, K, L, N, and O.\nSuppose moreover that on four previous occasions it has been separately\ncombined with each of these localities in a common activity. M may then\nbe indirectly awakened by any cause which tends to awaken either K, L,\nN, or O. But if the cause which awakens K, for instance, be so slight\nas only to increase its tension without arousing it to full discharge,\nK will only succeed in slightly increasing the tension of M. But if at\nthe same time the tensions of L, N, and O are similarly increased, the\ncombined effects of all four upon M may be so great as to awaken an\nactual discharge in this latter locality. In like manner if the paths\nbetween M and the four other localities have been so slightly excavated\nby previous experience as to require a very intense excitement in\neither of the localities before M can be awakened, a less strong\nexcitement than this in any one will fail to reach M. But if all four\nat once are mildly excited, their compound effect on M may be adequate\nto its full arousal.\n_The psychological law of association_ of objects thought of through\ntheir previous contiguity in thought or experience _would thus be an\neffect, within the mind, of the physical fact that nerve-currents\npropagate themselves easiest through those tracts of conduction which\nhave been already most in use._ Descartes and Locke hit upon this\nexplanation, which modern science has not yet succeeded in improving.\n\"Custom,\" says Locke, \"settles habits of thinking in the\nunderstanding, as well as of determining in the will, and of motions\nin the body; all which seem to be but _trains of motion in the animal\nspirits_ [by this Locke meant identically what we understand by\n_neural processes_] which, once set agoing, continue in the same steps\nthey have been used to, which by often treading are worn into a smooth\npath, and the motion in it becomes easy and, as it were, natural.\"[476]\nHartley was more thorough in his grasp of the principle. The sensorial\nnerve-currents, produced when objects are fully present, were for\nhim 'vibrations,' and those which produce ideas of objects in their\nabsence were 'miniature vibrations.' And he sums up the cause of mental\nassociation in a single formula by saying:\n\"Any vibrations, A, B, C, etc., by being associated together a\nsufficient Number of Times, get such a Power over _a, b, c,_ etc., the\ncorresponding Miniature Vibrations, that any of the Vibrations A, when\nimpressed alone, shall be able to excite _b, c,_ etc., the Miniatures\nof the rest.\"[477]\nIt is evident that if there be any law of neural habit similar to\nthis, the contiguities, coexistences, and successions, met with in\nouter experience, must inevitably be copied more or less perfectly in\nour thought. If A B C D E be a sequence of outer impressions (they\nmay be events or they may be successively experienced properties of\nan object) which once gave rise to the successive 'ideas' _a b c d\ne_, then no sooner will A impress us again and awaken the _a_, than\n_b c d e_ will arise as ideas even before B C D E have come in as\nimpressions. In other words, the order of impressions will the next\ntime be _anticipated_; and the mental order will so far forth copy the\norder of the outer world. Any object when met again will make us expect\nits former concomitants, through the overflowing of its brain-tract\ninto the paths which lead to theirs. And all these suggestions will be\neffects of a material law.\nWhere the associations are, as here, of successively appearing things,\nthe distinction I made at the outset of the chapter, between a\nconnection _thought of_ and a connection _of thoughts_, is unimportant.\nFor the connection thought of is concomitance or succession; and the\nconnection between the thoughts is just the same. The 'objects' and the\n'ideas' fit into parallel schemes, and may be described in identical\nlanguage, as contiguous things tending to be thought again together, or\ncontiguous ideas tending to recur together.\nNow were these cases fair samples of all association, the distinction\nI drew might well be termed a _Spitzfindigkeit_ or piece of pedantic\nhair-splitting, and be dropped. But as a matter of fact we cannot treat\nthe subject so simply. The same outer object may suggest _either of\nmany_ realities formerly associated with it--for in the vicissitudes of\nour outer experience we are constantly liable to meet the same thing\nin the midst of differing companions--and a philosophy of association\nthat should merely say that it will suggest one of these, or even of\nthat one of them which it has oftenest accompanied, would go but a\nvery short way into the _rationale_ of the subject. This, however, is\nabout as far as most associationists have gone with their 'principle\nof contiguity.' Granted an object, A, they never tell us beforehand\nwhich of its associates it _will_ suggest; their wisdom is limited to\nshowing, after it _has_ suggested a second object, that that object\nwas once an associate. They have had to supplement their principle\nof Contiguity by other principles, such as those of Similarity and\nContrast, before they could begin to do justice to the richness of the\nfacts.\nTHE ELEMENTARY LAW OF ASSOCIATION.\nI shall try to show, in the pages which immediately follow, that there\nis no other _elementary_ causal law of association than the law of\nneural habit. All the _materials_ of our thought are due to the way\nin which one elementary process of the cerebral hemispheres tends to\nexcite whatever other elementary process it may have excited at some\nformer time. The number of elementary processes at work, however, and\nthe nature of those which at any time are fully effective in rousing\nthe others, determine the character of the total brain-action, and,\nas a consequence of this, they determine the object thought of at the\ntime. According as this resultant object is one thing or another, we\ncall it a product of association by contiguity or of association by\nsimilarity, or contrast, or whatever other sorts we may have recognized\nas ultimate. Its production, however, is, in each one of these cases,\nto be explained by a merely quantitative variation in the elementary\nbrain-processes momentarily at work under the law of habit, so that\n_psychic_ contiguity, similarity, etc., are derivatives of a single\nprofounder kind of fact.\nMy thesis, stated thus briefly, will soon become more clear; and at the\nsame time certain disturbing factors, which co-operate with the law of\nneural habit, will come to view.\nLet us then assume as the _basis_ of all our subsequent reasoning this\nlaw: _When two elementary brain-processes have been active together\nor in immediate succession, one of them, on reoccurring, tends to\npropagate its excitement into the other._\nBut, as a matter of fact, every elementary process has found itself at\ndifferent times excited in conjunction with _many_ other processes,\nand this by unavoidable outward causes. Which of these others it shall\nawaken now becomes a problem. Shall _b_ or _c_ be aroused next by the\npresent _a_? We must make a further postulate, based, however, on\nthe fact of _tension_ in nerve-tissue, and on the fact of summation\nof excitements, each incomplete or latent in itself, into an open\nresultant.[478] The process _b_, rather than _c_, will awake, if in\naddition to the vibrating tract _a_ some other tract _d_ is in a state\nof sub-excitement, and formerly was excited with _b_ alone and not with\n_a_. In short, we may say:\n_The amount of activity at any given point in the brain-cortex is\nthe sum of the tendencies of all other points to discharge into it,\nsuch tendencies being proportionate_ (1) _to the number of times the\nexcitement of each other point may have accompanied that of the point\nin question_; (2) _to the intensity of such excitements; and_ (3) _to\nthe absence of any rival point functionally disconnected with the first\npoint, into which the discharges might be diverted._\nExpressing the fundamental law in this most complicated way leads to\nthe greatest ultimate simplification. Let us, for the present, only\ntreat of spontaneous trains of thought and ideation, such as occur in\nrevery or musing. The case of voluntary thinking toward a certain end\nshall come up later.\nTake, to fix our ideas, the two verses from 'Locksley Hall':\n\"I, the heir of all _the ages_ in the foremost files of time,\"\nand--\n\"For I doubt not through _the ages_ one increasing purpose runs.\"\nWhy is it that when we recite from memory one of these lines, and get\nas far as _the ages_, that portion of the _other_ line which follows,\nand, so to speak, sprouts out of _the ages_, does not also sprout out\nof our memory, and confuse the sense of our words? Simply because\nthe word that follows _the ages_ has its brain-process awakened not\nsimply by the brain-process of _the ages_ alone, but by it _plus_ the\nbrain-processes of all the words preceding _the ages_. The word _ages_\nat its moment of strongest activity would, _per se_, indifferently\ndischarge into either 'in' or 'one.' So would the previous words (whose\ntension is momentarily much less strong than that of _ages_) each of\nthem indifferently discharge into either of a large number of other\nwords with which they have been at different times combined. But when\nthe processes of '_I, the heir of all the ages_,' simultaneously\nvibrate in the brain, the last one of them in a maximal, the others in\na fading phase of excitement; then the strongest line of discharge will\nbe that which they _all alike_ tend to take. '_In_' and not '_one_' or\nany other word will be the next to awaken, for its brain-process has\npreviously vibrated in unison not only with that of _ages_, but with\nthat of all those other words whose activity is dying away. It is a\ngood case of the effectiveness over thought of what we called on p. 258\na 'fringe.'\nBut if some one of these preceding words--'heir,' for example--had an\nintensely strong association with some brain-tracts entirely disjoined\nin experience from the poem of 'Locksley Hall'--if the reciter, for\ninstance, were tremulously awaiting the opening of a will which might\nmake him a millionaire--it is probable that the path of discharge\nthrough the words of the poem would be suddenly interrupted at the word\n'heir.' His _emotional interest in that word_ would be such that its\n_own special associations would prevail_ over the combined ones of the\nother words. He would, as we say, be abruptly reminded of his personal\nsituation, and the poem would lapse altogether from his thoughts.\nThe writer of these pages has every year to learn the names of a large\nnumber of students who sit in alphabetical order in a lecture-room. He\nfinally learns to call them by name, as they sit in their accustomed\nplaces. On meeting one in the street, however, early in the year, the\nface hardly ever recalls the name, but it may recall the place of its\nowner in the lecture-room, his neighbors' faces, and consequently\nhis general alphabetical position; and then, usually as the common\nassociate of all these combined data, the student's name surges up in\nhis mind.\nA father wishes to show to some guests the progress of his rather dull\nchild in Kindergarten instruction. Holding the knife upright on the\ntable, he says, \"What do you call that, my boy?\" \"I calls it a _knife_,\nI does,\" is the sturdy reply, from which the child cannot be induced\nto swerve by any alteration in the form of question, until the father\nrecollecting that in the Kindergarten a pencil was used, and not a\nknife, draws a long one from his pocket, holds it in the same way,\nand then gets the wished-for answer, \"I calls it _vertical_.\" All the\nconcomitants of the Kindergarten experience had to recombine their\neffect before the word 'vertical' could be reawakened.\nProfessor Bain, in his chapters on 'Compound Association,' has treated\nin a minute and exhaustive way of this type of mental sequence, and\nwhat he has done so well need not be here repeated.[479]\n_Impartial Redintegration._\nThe ideal working of the law of compound association, were it\nunmodified by any extraneous influence, would be such as to keep the\nmind in a perpetual treadmill of concrete reminiscences from which no\ndetail could be omitted. Suppose, for example, we begin by thinking\nof a certain dinner-party. The only thing which all the components of\nthe dinner-party could combine to recall would be the first concrete\noccurrence which ensued upon it. All the details of this occurrence\ncould in turn only combine to awaken the next following occurrence, and\nso on. If _a, b, c, d, e,_ for instance, be the elementary nerve-tracts\nexcited by the last act of the dinner-party, call this act A, and _l,\nm, n, o, p,_ be those of walking home through the frosty night, which\nwe may call B, then the thought of A must awaken that of B, because\n_a, b, c, d, e,_ will each and all discharge into _l_ through the\npaths by which their original discharge took place. Similarly they\nwill discharge into _m, n, o,_ and _p_; and these latter tracts will\nalso each reinforce the other's action because, in the experience B,\nthey have already vibrated in unison. The lines in Fig. 40 symbolize\nthe summation of discharges into each of the components of B, and the\nconsequent strength of the combination of influences by which B in its\ntotality is awakened.\nHamilton first used the word 'redintegration' to designate all\nassociation. Such processes as we have just described might in an\nemphatic sense be termed redintegrations, for they would necessarily\nlead, if unobstructed, to the reinstatement in thought of the _entire_\ncontent of large trains of past experience. From this complete\nredintegration there could be no escape save through the irruption\nof some new and strong present impression of the senses, or through\nthe excessive tendency of some one of the elementary brain-tracts to\ndischarge independently into an aberrant quarter of the brain. Such\nwas the tendency of the word 'heir' in the verse from 'Locksley Hall,'\nwhich was our first example. How such tendencies are constituted we\nshall have soon to inquire with some care. Unless they are present,\nthe panorama of the past, once opened, must unroll itself with fatal\nliterality to the end, unless some outward sound, sight, or touch\ndivert the current of thought.\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\nLet us call this process _impartial redintegration_. Whether it ever\noccurs in an absolutely complete form is doubtful. We all immediately\nrecognize, however, that in some minds there is a much greater tendency\nthan in others for the flow of thought to take this form. Those\ninsufferably garrulous old women, those dry and fanciless beings who\nspare you no detail, however petty, of the facts they are recounting,\nand upon the thread of whose narrative all the irrelevant items cluster\nas pertinaciously as the essential ones, the slaves of literal fact,\nthe stumblers over the smallest abrupt step in thought, are figures\nknown to all of us. Comic literature has made her profit out of\nthem. Juliet's nurse is a classical example. George Eliot's village\ncharacters and some of Dickens's minor personages supply excellent\ninstances.\nPerhaps as successful a rendering as any of this mental type is\nthe character of Miss Bates in Miss Austen's 'Emma.' Hear how she\nredintegrates:\n\"'But where could _you_ hear it?' cried Miss Bates. 'Where could you\npossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\nreceived Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at\nleast ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come\nout--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane\nwas standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was\nso afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said\nI would go down and see, and Jane said: \"Shall I go down instead?\nfor I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the\nkitchen.\" \"Oh, my dear,\" said I--well, and just then came the note.\nA Miss Hawkins--that's all I know--a Miss Hawkins, of Bath. But, Mr.\nKnightley, how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment\nMr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss\nHawkins--'\"\nBut in every one of us there are moments when this complete\nreproduction of all the items of a past experience occurs. What are\nthose moments? They are moments of emotional recall of the past as\nsomething which once was, but is gone for ever--moments, the interest\nof which consists in the feeling that our self was once other than\nit now is. When this is the case, any detail, however minute, which\nwill make the past picture more complete, will also have its effect in\nswelling that total contrast between _now_ and _then_ which forms the\ncentral interest of our contemplation.\nORDINARY OR MIXED ASSOCIATION.\nThis case helps us to understand why it is that the ordinary\nspontaneous flow of our ideas does not follow the law of impartial\nredintegration. _In no revival of a past experience are all the\nitems of our thought equally operative in determining what the next\nthought shall be. Always some ingredient is prepotent over the rest._\nIts special suggestions or associations in this case will often be\ndifferent from those which it has in common with the whole group of\nitems; and its tendency to awaken these outlying associates will\ndeflect the path of our revery. Just as in the original sensible\nexperience our attention focalized itself upon a few of the impressions\nof the scene before us, so here in the reproduction of those\nimpressions an equal partiality is shown, and some items are emphasized\nabove the rest. What these items shall be is, in most cases of\nspontaneous revery, hard to determine beforehand. In subjective terms\nwe say that _the prepotent items are those which appeal most to our_\nINTEREST.\nExpressed in brain-terms, the law of interest will be: _some one\nbrain-process is always prepotent above its concomitants in arousing\naction elsewhere._\n\"Two processes,\" says Mr. Hodgson,[480] \"are constantly going on\nin redintegration. The one a process of corrosion, melting, decay;\nthe other a process of renewing, arising, becoming.... No object of\nrepresentation remains long before consciousness in the same state,\nbut fades, decays, and becomes indistinct. Those parts of the object,\nhowever, which possess an interest resist this tendency to gradual\ndecay of the whole object.... This inequality in the object--some\nparts, the uninteresting, submitting to decay; others, the interesting\nparts, resisting it--when it has continued for a certain time, ends in\nbecoming a new object.\"\nOnly where the interest is diffused equally over all the parts (as\nin the emotional memory just referred to, where, as all _past_, they\nall interest us alike) is this law departed from. It will be least\nobeyed by those minds which have the smallest variety and intensity\nof interests--those who, by the general flatness and poverty of their\n\u00e6sthetic nature, are kept for ever rotating among the literal sequences\nof their local and personal history.\nMost of us, however, are better organized than this, and our musings\npursue an erratic course, swerving continually into some new direction\ntraced by the shifting play of interest as it ever falls on some\npartial item in each complex representation that is evoked. Thus it\nso often comes about that we find ourselves thinking at two nearly\nadjacent moments of things separated by the whole diameter of space\nand time. Not till we carefully recall each step of our cogitation do\nwe see how naturally we came by Hodgson's law to pass from one to the\nother. Thus, for instance, after looking at my clock just now (1879),\nI found myself thinking of a recent resolution in the Senate about our\nlegal-tender notes. The clock called up the image of the man who had\nrepaired its gong. He suggested the jeweller's shop where I had last\nseen him; that shop, some shirt-studs which I had bought there; they,\nthe value of gold and its recent decline; the latter, the equal value\nof greenbacks, and this, naturally, the question of how long they were\nto last, and of the Bayard proposition. Each of these images offered\nvarious points of interest. Those which formed the turning-points of\nmy thought are easily assigned. The gong was momentarily the most\ninteresting part of the clock, because, from having begun with a\nbeautiful tone, it had become discordant and aroused disappointment.\nBut for this the clock might have suggested the friend who gave it to\nme, or any one of a thousand circumstances connected with clocks. The\njeweller's shop suggested the studs, because they alone of all its\ncontents were tinged with the egoistic interest of possession. This\ninterest in the studs, their value, made me single out the material\nas its chief source, etc., to the end. Every reader who will arrest\nhimself at any moment and say, \"How came I to be thinking of just\nthis?\" will be sure to trace a train of representations linked together\nby lines of contiguity and points of interest inextricably combined.\nThis is the ordinary process of the association of ideas as it\nspontaneously goes on in average minds. _We may call it_ ORDINARY, _or_\nMIXED, ASSOCIATION.\nAnother example of it is given by Hobbes in a passage which has been\nquoted so often as to be classical:\n\"In a discourse of our present civil war, what could seem more\nimpertinent than to ask (as one did) what was the value of a Roman\npenny? Yet the coherence to me was manifest enough. For the thought of\nthe war introduced the thought of the delivering up the King to his\nenemies; the thought of that brought in the thought of the delivering\nup of Christ; and that again the thought of the thirty pence, which\nwas the price of that treason: and thence easily followed that\nmalicious question; and all this in a moment of time; for thought is\nquick.\"[481]\nCan we determine, now, when a certain portion of the going thought\nhas, by dint of its interest, become so prepotent as to make its own\nexclusive associates the dominant features of the coming thought--can\nwe, I say, determine _which_ of its own associates shall be evoked? For\nthey are many. As Hodgson says:\n\"The interesting parts of the decaying object are free to combine\nagain with any objects or parts of objects with which at any time they\nhave been combined before. All the former combinations of these parts\nmay come back into consciousness; one must; but which will?\"\nMr. Hodgson replies:\n\"There can be but one answer: that which has been most _habitually_\ncombined with them before. This new object begins at once to form\nitself in consciousness, and to group its parts round the part still\nremaining from the former object; part after part comes out and\narranges itself in its old position; but scarcely has the process\nbegun, when the original law of interest begins to operate on this\nnew formation, seizes on the interesting parts and impresses them on\nthe attention to the exclusion of the rest, and the whole process is\nrepeated again with endless variety. I venture to propose this as a\ncomplete and true account of the whole process of redintegration.\"\nIn restricting the discharge from the interesting item into that\nchannel which is simply most _habitual_ in the sense of most frequent,\nHodgson's account is assuredly imperfect. An image by no means always\nrevives its most frequent associate, although frequency is certainly\none of the most potent determinants of revival. If I abruptly utter\nthe word _swallow_, the reader, if by habit an ornithologist, will\nthink of a bird; if a physiologist or a medical specialist in throat\ndiseases, he will think of deglutition. If I say _date_, he will, if\na fruit-merchant or an Arabian traveller, think of the produce of the\npalm; if an habitual student of history, figures with A.D. or B.C.\nbefore them will rise in his mind. If I say _bed, bath, morning,_\nhis own daily toilet will be invincibly suggested by the combined\nnames of three of its habitual associates. But frequent lines of\ntransition are often set at naught. The sight of C. Goring's 'System\nder kritischen Philosophie' has most frequently awakened in me thoughts\nof the opinions therein propounded. The idea of suicide has never been\nconnected with the volumes. But a moment since, as my eye fell upon\nthem, suicide was the thought that flashed into my mind. Why? Because\nbut yesterday I received a letter from Leipzig informing me that this\nphilosopher's recent death by drowning was an act of self-destruction.\nThoughts tend, then, to awaken their most recent as well as their most\nhabitual associates. This is a matter of notorious experience, too\nnotorious, in fact, to need illustration. If we have seen our friend\nthis morning, the mention of his name now recalls the circumstances\nof that interview, rather than any more remote details concerning\nhim. If Shakespeare's plays are mentioned, and we were last night\nreading 'Richard II.,' vestiges of that play rather than of 'Hamlet'\nor 'Othello' float through our mind. Excitement of peculiar tracts,\nor peculiar modes of general excitement in the brain, leave a sort of\ntenderness or exalted sensibility behind them which takes days to die\naway. As long as it lasts, those tracts or those modes are liable to\nhave their activities awakened by causes which at other times might\nleave them in repose. Hence, _recency_ in experience is a prime factor\nin determining revival in thought.[482]\n_Vividness_ in an original experience may also have the same effect as\nhabit or recency in bringing about likelihood of revival. If we have\nonce witnessed an execution, any subsequent conversation or reading\nabout capital punishment will almost certainly suggest images of that\nparticular scene. Thus it is that events lived through only once, and\nin youth, may come in after-years, by reason of their exciting quality\nor emotional intensity, to serve as types or instances used by our\nmind to illustrate any and every occurring topic whose interest is\nmost remotely pertinent to theirs. If a man in his boyhood once talked\nwith Napoleon, any mention of great men or historical events, battles\nor thrones, or the whirligig of fortune, or islands in the ocean,\nwill be apt to draw to his lips the incidents of that one memorable\ninterview. If the word _tooth_ now suddenly appears on the page before\nthe reader's eye, there are fifty chances out of a hundred that, if\nhe gives it time to awaken any image, it will be an image of some\noperation of dentistry in which he has been the sufferer. Daily he\nhas touched his teeth and masticated with them; this very morning he\nbrushed them, chewed his breakfast and picked them; but the rarer and\nremoter associations arise more promptly because they were so much more\nintense.[483]\nA fourth factor in tracing the course of reproduction is _congruity\nin emotional tone_ between the reproduced idea and our mood. The same\nobjects do not recall the same associates when we are cheerful as when\nwe are melancholy. Nothing, in fact, is more striking than our utter\ninability to keep up trains of joyous imagery when we are depressed\nin spirits. Storm, darkness, war, images of disease, poverty, and\nperishing afflict unremittingly the imaginations of melancholiacs.\nAnd those of sanguine temperament, when their spirits are high, find\nit impossible to give any permanence to evil forebodings or to gloomy\nthoughts. In an instant the train of association dances off to flowers\nand sunshine, and images of spring and hope. The records of Arctic or\nAfrican travel perused in one mood awaken no thoughts but those of\nhorror at the malignity of Nature; read at another time they suggest\nonly enthusiastic reflections on the indomitable power and pluck of\nman. Few novels so overflow with joyous animal spirits as 'The Three\nGuardsmen' of Dumas. Yet it may awaken in the mind of a reader\ndepressed with sea-sickness (as the writer can personally testify) a\nmost dismal and woeful consciousness of the cruelty and carnage of\nwhich heroes like Athos, Porthos, and Aramis make themselves guilty.\n_Habit, recency, vividness, and emotional congruity_ are, then, all\nreasons why one representation rather than another should be awakened\nby the interesting portion of a departing thought. We may say with\ntruth that _in the majority of cases the coming representation will\nhave been either habitual, recent, or vivid, and will be congruous._ If\nall these qualities unite in any one absent associate, we may predict\nalmost infallibly that that associate of the going thought will form\nan important ingredient in the coming thought. In spite of the fact,\nhowever, that the succession of representations is thus redeemed from\nperfect indeterminism and limited to a few classes whose characteristic\nquality is fixed by the nature of our past experience, it must still\nbe confessed that an immense number of terms in the linked chain of\nour representations fall outside of all assignable rule. To take\nthe instance of the clock given on page 586. Why did the jeweller's\nshop suggest the shirt-studs rather than a chain which I had bought\nthere more recently, which had cost more, and whose sentimental\nassociations were much more interesting? Both chain and studs had\nexcited brain-tracts simultaneously with the shop. The only reason why\nthe nerve-stream from the shop-tract switched off into the stud-tract\nrather than into the chain-tract must be that the stud-tract happened\nat that moment to lie more open, either because of some accidental\nalteration in its nutrition or because the incipient sub-conscious\ntensions of the brain as a whole had so distributed their equilibrium,\nthat it was more unstable here than in the chain-tract. Any reader's\nintrospection will easily furnish similar instances. It thus remains\ntrue that to a certain extent, even in those forms of ordinary mixed\nassociation which lie nearest to impartial redintegration, _which_\nassociate of the interesting item shall emerge must be called largely a\nmatter of accident--accident, that is, for our intelligence. No doubt\nit is determined by cerebral causes, but they are too subtile and\nshifting for our analysis.\nASSOCIATION BY SIMILARITY.\nIn partial or mixed association we have all along supposed the\ninteresting portion of the disappearing thought to be of considerable\nextent, and to be sufficiently complex to constitute by itself a\nconcrete object. Sir William Hamilton relates, for instance, that\nafter thinking of Ben Lomond he found himself thinking of the Prussian\nsystem of education, and discovered that the links of association\nwere a German gentleman whom he had met on Ben Lomond, Germany, etc.\nThe interesting part of Ben Lomond, as he had experienced it, the\npart operative in determining the train of his ideas was the complex\nimage of a particular man. But now let us suppose that that selective\nagency of interested attention, which may thus convert impartial\nredintegration into partial association--let us suppose that it refines\nitself still further and accentuates a portion of the passing thought,\nso small as to be no longer the image of a concrete thing, but only\nof an abstract quality or property. Let us moreover suppose that the\npart thus accentuated persists in consciousness (or, in cerebral\nterms, has its brain-process continue) after the other portions of the\nthought have faded. _This small surviving portion will then surround\nitself with its own associates_ after the fashion we have already\nseen, and the relation between the new thought's object and the object\nof the faded thought will be a _relation of similarity_. The pair of\nthoughts will form an instance of what is called '_Association by\nSimilarity_.'[484]\nThe similars which are here associated, or of which the first is\nfollowed by the second in the mind, are seen to be _compounds_.\nExperience proves that this is always the case. _There is no tendency\non the part of_ SIMPLE _'ideas,' attributes, or qualities to remind us\nof their like._ The thought of one shade of blue does not remind us of\nthat of another shade of blue, etc., unless indeed we have in mind some\ngeneral purpose like naming the tint, when we should naturally think\nof other blues of the scale, through 'mixed association' of purpose,\nnames, and tints, together. But there is no elementary tendency of pure\nqualities to awaken their similars in the mind.\nWe saw in the chapter on Discrimination that two compound things are\nsimilar when some one quality or group of qualities is shared alike by\nboth, although as regards their other qualities they may have nothing\nin common. The moon is similar to a gas-jet, it is also similar to a\nfoot-ball; but a gas-jet and a foot-ball are not similar to each other.\nWhen we affirm the similarity of two compound things, we should always\nsay _in what respect it obtains_. Moon and gas-jet are similar in\nrespect of luminosity, and nothing else; moon and foot-ball in respect\nof rotundity, and nothing else. Foot-ball and gas-jet are in no respect\nsimilar--that is, they possess no common point, no identical attribute.\nSimilarity, in compounds, is partial identity. When the _same_\nattribute appears in two phenomena, though it be their only common\nproperty, the two phenomena are similar in so far forth. To return\nnow to our associated representations. If the thought of the moon is\nsucceeded by the thought of a foot-ball, and that by the thought of one\nof Mr. X's railroads, it is because the attribute rotundity in the moon\nbroke away from all the rest and surrounded itself with an entirely new\nset of companions--elasticity, leathery integument, swift mobility in\nobedience to human caprice, etc.; and because the last-named attribute\nin the foot-ball in turn broke away from its companions, and, itself\npersisting, surrounded itself with such new attributes as make up the\nnotions of a 'railroad king,' of a rising and falling stock-market, and\nthe like.\nThe gradual passage from impartial redintegration to similar\nassociation through what we have called ordinary mixed association may\nbe symbolized by diagrams. Fig. 41 is impartial redintegration, Fig. 42\nis mixed, and Fig. 43 similar association. A in each is the passing,\nB the coming thought. In 'impartial,' all parts of A are equally\noperative in calling up B. In 'mixed,' most parts of A are inert. The\npart M alone breaks out and awakens B. In 'similar,' the focalized\npart M is much smaller than in the previous case, and after awakening\nits new set of associates, instead of fading out itself, it continues\npersistently active along with them, forming an identical part in the\ntwo ideas, and making these, _pro tanto_, resemble each other.\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.]\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.]\nWhy a single portion of the passing thought should break out from its\nconcert with the rest and act, as we say, on its own hook, why the\nother parts should become inert, are mysteries which we can ascertain\nbut not explain. Possibly a minuter insight into the laws of neural\naction will some day clear the matter up; possibly neural laws will\nnot suffice, and we shall need to invoke a dynamic reaction of the form\nof consciousness upon its content. But into this we cannot enter now.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTo sum up, then, we see that _the difference between the three kinds\nof association reduces itself to a simple difference in the amount\nof that portion of the nerve-tract supporting the going thought\nwhich is operative in calling up the thought which comes._ But the\n_modus operandi_ of this active part is the same, be it large or be\nit small. The items constituting the coming object waken in every\ninstance because their nerve-tracts once were excited continuously\nwith those of the going object or its operative part. This ultimate\nphysiological law of habit among the neural elements is what _runs_ the\ntrain. The direction of its course and the form of its transitions,\nwhether redintegrative, associative, or similar, are due to unknown\nregulative or determinative conditions which accomplish their effect by\nopening this switch and closing that, setting the engine sometimes at\nhalf-speed, and coupling or uncoupling cars.\nThis last figure of speech, into which I have glided unwittingly,\naffords itself an excellent instance of association by similarity.\nI was thinking of the deflections of the course of ideas. Now, from\nHobbes's time downward, English writers have been fond of speaking of\nthe _train_ of our representations. This word happened to stand out in\nthe midst of my complex thought with peculiarly sharp accentuation, and\nto surround itself with numerous details of railroad imagery. Only such\ndetails became clear, however, as had their nerve-tracts besieged by a\ndouble set of influences--those from _train_ on the one hand, and those\nfrom the _movement of thought_ on the other. It may possibly be that\nthe prepotency of the suggestions of the word _train_ at this moment\nwere due to the recent excitation of the railroad brain-tract by the\ninstance chosen a few pages back of ii railroad king playing foot-ball\nwith the stock-market.\nIt is apparent from such an example how inextricably complex are all\nthe contributory factors whose resultant is the line of our reverie.\nIt would be folly in most cases to attempt to trace them out. From an\ninstance like the above, where the pivot of the Similar Association\nwas formed by a definite concrete word, _train_, to those where it is\nso subtile as utterly to elude our analysis, the passage is unbroken.\nWe can form a series of examples. When Mr. Bagehot says that the mind\nof the savage, so far from being in a state of nature, is _tattooed_\nall over with monstrous superstitions, the case is very like the one\nwe have just been considering. When Sir James Stephen compares our\nbelief in the uniformity of nature, the congruity of the future with\nthe past, to a man rowing one way and looking another, and steering\nhis boat by keeping her stern in a line with an object behind him,\nthe operative link becomes harder to dissect out. It is subtler still\nin Dr. Holmes's phrase, that stories in passing from mouth to mouth\nmake a great deal of lee-way in proportion to their headway; or in\nMr. Lowell's description of German sentences, that they have a way of\nyawing and going stern-foremost and not minding the helm for several\nminutes after it has been put down. And finally, it is a real puzzle\nwhen the color pale-blue is said to have feminine and blood-red\nmasculine affinities. And if I hear a friend describe a certain family\nas having _blotting-paper_ voices, the image, though immediately felt\nto be apposite, baffles the utmost powers of analysis. The higher poets\nall use abrupt epithets, which are alike intimate and remote, and, as\nEmerson says, sweetly torment us with invitations to their inaccessible\nhomes.\nIn these latter instances we must suppose that there is an identical\nportion in the similar objects, and that its brain-tract is\nenergetically operative, without, however, being sufficiently isolable\nin its activity as to stand out _per se_, and form the condition of a\ndistinctly discriminated 'abstract idea.' We cannot even by careful\nsearch see the bridge over which we passed from the heart of one\nrepresentation to that of the next. In some brains, however, this\nmode of transition is extremely common. It would be one of the most\nimportant of physiological discoveries could we assign the mechanical\nor chemical difference which makes the thoughts of one brain cling\nclose to impartial redintegration, while those of another shoot about\nin all the lawless revelry of similarity. Why, in these latter brains,\naction should tend to focalize itself in small spots, while in the\nothers it fills patiently its broad bed, it seems impossible to guess.\nWhatever the difference may be, it is what separates the man of genius\nfrom the prosaic creature of habit and routine thinking. In Chapter\nXXII we shall need to recur again to this point.\nASSOCIATION IN VOLUNTARY THOUGHT.\nHitherto we have assumed the process of suggestion of one object by\nanother to be spontaneous. The train of imagery wanders at its own\nsweet will, now trudging in sober grooves of habit, now with a hop,\nskip, and jump darting across the whole field of time and space.\nThis is revery, or musing; but great segments of the flux of our\nideas consist of something very different from this. They are guided\nby a distinct purpose or conscious interest. As the Germans say, we\n_nachdenken_, or think towards a certain end. It is now necessary to\nexamine what modification is made in the trains of our imagery by\nthe having of an end in view. The course of our ideas is then called\n_voluntary_.\nPhysiologically considered, we must suppose that a purpose means\nthe persistent activity of certain rather definite brain-processes\nthroughout the whole course of thought. Our most usual cogitations are\nnot pure reveries, absolute driftings, but revolve about some central\ninterest or topic to which most of the images are relevant, and towards\nwhich we return promptly after occasional digressions. This interest\nis subserved by the persistently active brain-tracts we have supposed.\nIn the mixed associations which we have hitherto studied, the parts of\neach object which form the pivots on which our thoughts successively\nturn have their interest largely determined by their connection with\nsome _general interest_ which for the time has seized upon the mind.\nIf we call Z the brain-tract of general interest, then, if the object\n_abc_ turns up, and _b_ has more associations with Z than have either\n_a_ or _c, b_ will become the object's interesting, pivotal portion,\nand will call up its own associates exclusively. For the energy of\n_b_'s brain-tract will be augmented by Z's activity,--an activity\nwhich, from lack of previous connection between Z and _a_ or _c_, does\nnot influence _a_ or _c_. If, for instance, I think of Paris whilst I\nam _hungry_, I shall not improbably find that its _restaurants_ have\nbecome the pivot of my thought, etc., etc.\nBut in the theoretic as well as in the practical life there are\ninterests of a more acute sort, taking the form of definite images\nof some achievement, be it action or acquisition, which we desire to\neffect. The train of ideas arising under the influence of such an\ninterest constitutes usually the thought of the _means_ by which the\nend shall be attained. If the end by its simple presence does not\ninstantaneously suggest the means, the search for the latter becomes\nan intellectual _problem_. The solution of problems is the most\ncharacteristic and peculiar sort of voluntary thinking. Where the\nend thought of is some outward deed or gain, the solution is largely\ncomposed of the actual motor processes, walking, speaking, writing,\netc., which lead up to it. Where the end is in the first instance only\nideal, as in laying out a place of operations, the steps are purely\nimaginary. In both of these cases the discovery of the means may form\na new sort of end, of an entirely peculiar nature, an end, namely,\nwhich we intensely desire before we have attained it, but of the nature\nof which, even whilst most strongly craving it, we have no distinct\nimagination whatever. Such an end is a problem.\nThe same state of things occurs whenever we seek to recall something\nforgotten, or to state the reason for a judgment which we have made\nintuitively. The desire strains and presses in a direction which it\nfeels to be right but towards a point which it is unable to see. In\nshort, the _absence of an item_ is a determinant of our representations\nquite as positive as its presence can ever be. The gap becomes no\nmere void, but what is called an _aching_ void. If we try to explain\nin terms of brain-action how a thought which only potentially\nexists can yet be effective, we seem driven to believe that the\nbrain-tract thereof must actually be excited, but only in a minimal\nand sub-conscious way. Try, for instance, to symbolize what goes on in\na man who is racking his brains to remember a thought which occurred\nto him last week. The associates of the thought are there, many of\nthem at least, but they refuse to awaken the thought itself. We cannot\nsuppose that they do not irradiate _at all_ into its brain-tract,\nbecause his mind quivers on the very edge of its recovery. Its actual\nrhythm sounds in his ears; the words seem on the imminent point of\nfollowing, but fail. What it is that blocks the discharge and keeps the\nbrain-excitement here from passing beyond the nascent into the vivid\nstate cannot be guessed. But we see in the philosophy of desire and\npleasure, that such nascent excitements, spontaneously tending to a\ncrescendo, but inhibited or checked by other causes, may become potent\nmental stimuli and determinants of desire. All questioning, wonder,\nemotion of curiosity, must be referred to cerebral causes of some\nsuch form as this. The great difference between the effort to recall\nthings forgotten and the search after the means to a given end, is that\nthe latter have not, whilst the former have, already formed a part\nof our experience. If we first study _the mode of recalling a thing\nforgotten_, we can take up with better understanding the voluntary\nquest of the unknown.\nThe forgotten thing is felt by us as a gap in the midst of certain\nother things. If it is a thought, we possess a dim idea of where we\nwere and what we were about when it occurred to us. We recollect the\ngeneral subject to which it relates. But all these details refuse to\nshoot together into a solid whole, for the lack of the vivid traits\nof this missing thought, the relation whereof to each detail forms\nnow the main interest of the latter. We keep running over the details\nin our mind, dissatisfied, craving something more. From each detail\nthere radiate lines of association forming so many tentative guesses.\nMany of these are immediately seen to be irrelevant, are therefore\nvoid of interest, and lapse immediately from consciousness. Others are\nassociated with the other details present, and with the missing thought\nas well. When _these_ surge up, we have a peculiar feeling that we are\n'warm,' as the children say when they play hide and seek; and such\nassociates as these we clutch at and keep before the attention. Thus\nwe recollect successively that when we had the thought in question we\nwere at the dinner-table; then that our friend J. D. was there; then\nthat the subject talked about was so and so; finally, that the thought\ncame _\u00e0 propos_ of a certain anecdote, and then that it had something\nto do with a French quotation. Now all these added associations _arise\nindependently of the will_, by the spontaneous process we know so well.\n_All that the will does is to emphasize and linger over those which\nseem pertinent, and ignore the rest._ Through this hovering of the\nattention in the neighborhood of the desired object, the accumulation\nof associates becomes so great that the combined tensions of their\nneural processes break through the bar, and the nervous wave pours\ninto the tract which has so long been awaiting its advent. And as the\nexpectant, sub-conscious itching there, bursts into the fulness of\nvivid feeling, the mind finds an inexpressible relief.\nThe whole process can be rudely symbolized in a diagram. Call the\nforgotten thing Z, the first facts with which we felt it was related,\n_a, b,_ and _c_, and the details finally operative in calling it up,\n_l, m,_ and _n_. Each circle will then stand for the brain-process\nunderlying the thought of the object denoted by the letter contained\nwithin it. The activity in Z will at first be a mere tension; but as\nthe activities in _a, b,_ and _c_ little by little irradiate into _l,\nm,_ and _n,_ and as _all_ these processes are somehow connected with\nZ, their combined irradiations upon Z, represented by the centripetal\narrows, succeed in helping the tension there to overcome the\nresistance, and in rousing Z also to full activity.\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.]\nThe tension present from the first in Z, even though it keep below\nthe threshold of discharge, is probably to some degree co-operative\nwith _a, b, c_ in determining that _l, m, n_ shall awake. Without Z's\ntension there might be a slower accumulation of objects connected with\nit. But, as aforesaid, the objects come before us through the brain's\nown laws, and the Ego of the thinker can only remain on hand, as it\nwere, to recognize their relative values and brood over some of them,\nwhilst others are let drop. As when we have lost a material object we\ncannot recover it by a direct effort, but only through moving about\nsuch neighborhoods wherein it is likely to lie, and trusting that it\nwill then strike our eye; so here, by not letting our attention leave\nthe neighborhood of what we seek, we trust that it will end by speaking\nto us of its own accord.[485]\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Turn now to the case of finding the unknown means to a distinctly\nconceived end._ The end here stands in the place of _a, b, c,_ in the\ndiagram. It is the starting-point of the irradiations of suggestion;\nand here, as in that case, what the voluntary attention does is only\nto dismiss some of the suggestions as irrelevant, and hold fast to\nothers which are felt to be more pertinent--let these be symbolized by\n_l, m, n_. These latter at last accumulate sufficiently to discharge\nall together into Z, the excitement of which process is, in the mental\nsphere, equivalent to the solution of our problem. The only difference\nbetween this case and the last, is that in this one there need be\nno original sub-excitement in Z, co-operating from the very first.\nWhen we seek a forgotten name, we must suppose the name's centre\nto be in a state of active tension from the very outset, because of\nthat peculiar feeling of _recognition_ which we get at the moment of\nrecall. The plenitude of the thought seems here but a maximum degree\nof something which our mind divined in advance. It instantaneously\nfills a socket completely moulded to its shape; and it seems most\nnatural to ascribe the identity of quality in our feeling of the gaping\nsocket and our feeling of what comes to fill it, to the sameness of a\nnerve-tract excited in different degrees. In the solving of a problem,\non the contrary, the recognition that we have found the means is much\nless immediate. Here, what we are aware of in advance seems to be\nits relations with the items we already know. It must bear a causal\nrelation, or it must be an effect, or it must contain an attribute\ncommon to two items, or it must be a uniform concomitant, or what not.\nWe know, in short, a lot _about_ it, whilst as yet we have no knowledge\nof _acquaintance_ with it (see p. 221), or in Mr. Hodgson's language,\n\"we know what we want to find beforehand, in a certain sense, in its\nsecond intention, and do not know it, in another sense, in its first\nintention.\"[486] Our intuition that one of the ideas which turn up is,\nat last, our _qu\u00e6situm_, is due to our recognition that its relations\nare identical with those we had in mind, and this may be a rather slow\nact of judgment. In fact, every one knows that an object may be for\nsome time present to his mind before its relations to other matters are\nperceived. To quote Hodgson again:\n\"The mode of operation is common to voluntary memory and reason....\nBut reasoning adds to memory the function of comparing or judging the\nimages which arise.... Memory aims at filling the gap with an image\nwhich has at some particular time filled it before, reasoning with one\nwhich bears certain time-and space-relations to the images before and\nafter\"--\nor, to use perhaps clearer language, one which stands in determinate\nlogical relations to those data round about the gap which filled our\nmind at the start. This feeling of the blank form of relationship\nbefore we get the material quality of the thing related will surprise\nno one who has read Chapter IX.\nFrom the guessing of newspaper enigmas to the plotting of the policy of\nan empire there is no other process than this. We trust to the laws of\ncerebral nature to present us spontaneously with the appropriate idea:\n\"Our only command over it is by the effort we make to keep the painful\nunfilled gap in consciousness.[487]... Two circumstances are important\nto notice: the first is, that volition has no power of calling up\nimages, but only of rejecting and selecting from those offered by\nspontaneous redintegration.[488] But the rapidity with which this\nselection is made, owing to the familiarity of the ways in which\nspontaneous redintegration runs, gives the process of reasoning the\nappearance of evoking images that are foreseen to be conformable to\nthe purpose. There is no seeing them before they are offered; there\nis no summoning them before they are seen. The other circumstance is,\nthat every kind of reasoning is nothing, in its simplest form, but\nattention.\"[489]\nIt is foreign to our purpose here to enter into any detailed analysis\nof the different classes of mental pursuit. In a scientific research\nwe get perhaps as rich an example as can be found. The inquirer starts\nwith a fact of which he seeks the reason, or with an hypothesis of\nwhich he seeks the proof. In either case he keeps turning the matter\nincessantly in his mind until, by the arousal of associate upon\nassociate, some habitual, some similar, one arises which he recognizes\nto suit his need. This, however, may take years. No rules can be given\nby which the investigator may proceed straight to his result; but both\nhere and in the case of reminiscence the accumulation of helps in the\nway of associations may advance more rapidly by the use of certain\nroutine methods. In striving to recall a thought, for example, we may\nof set purpose run through the successive classes of circumstance with\nwhich it may possibly have been connected, trusting that when the\nright member of the class has turned up it will help the thought's\nrevival. Thus we may run through all the _places_ in which we may have\nhad it. We may run through the _persons_ whom we remember to have\nconversed with, or we may call up successively all the _books_ we have\nlately been reading. If we are trying to remember a person we may run\nthrough a list of streets or of professions. Some item out of the lists\nthus methodically gone over will very likely be associated with the\nfact we are in need of, and may suggest it or help to do so. And yet\nthe item might never have arisen without such systematic procedure. In\nscientific research this accumulation of associates has been methodized\nby Mill under the title of 'The Four Methods of Experimental Inquiry.'\nBy the 'method of agreement,' by that of 'difference,' by those of\n'residues' and 'concomitant variations'(which cannot here be more\nnearly defined), we make certain lists of cases; and by ruminating\nthese lists in our minds the cause we seek will be more likely to\nemerge. But the final stroke of discovery is only prepared, not\neffected, by them. The brain-tracts must, of their own accord, shoot\nthe right way at last, or we shall still grope in darkness. That in\nsome brains the tracts _do_ shoot the right way much oftener than in\nothers, and that we cannot tell why,--these are ultimate facts to which\nwe must never close our eyes. Even in forming our lists of instances\naccording to Mill's methods, we are at the mercy of the spontaneous\nworkings of Similarity in our brain. How are a number of facts,\nresembling the one whose cause we seek, to be brought together in a\nlist unless the one will rapidly suggest the other through association\nby similarity?\nSIMILARITY NO ELEMENTARY LAW.\nSuch is the analysis I propose, first of the three main types of\nspontaneous association, and then of voluntary association. It will\nbe observed that the _object called up may bear any logical relation\nwhatever to the one which suggested it_. The law requires only that\none condition should be fulfilled. The fading object must be due to\na brain-process some of whose elements awaken through habit some\nof the elements of the brain-process of the object which comes to\nview. This awakening is the operative machinery, the causal agency,\nthroughout, quite as much so in the kind of association I have called\nby the name of Similarity, as in any other sort. The similarity between\nthe objects, or between the thoughts (if similarity there be between\nthese latter), has no causal agency in carrying us from one to the\nother. It is but a result--the effect of the usual causal agent when\nthis happens to work in a certain particular and assignable way. But\nordinary writers talk as if the similarity of the objects were itself\nan agent, co-ordinate with habit, and independent of it, and like it\nable to push objects before the mind. This is quite unintelligible. The\nsimilarity of two things does not exist till both things are there--it\nis meaningless to talk of it as an _agent of production_ of anything,\nwhether in the physical or the psychical realms.[490] It is a relation\nwhich the mind perceives after the fact, just as it may perceive the\nrelations of superiority, of distance, of causality, of container and\ncontent, of substance and accident, or of contrast, between an object\nand some second object which the associative machinery calls up.[491]\nThere are, nevertheless, able writers who not only insist on preserving\nassociation by similarity as a distinct elementary law, but who make\nit the most elementary law, and seek to derive contiguous association\nfrom it. Their reasoning is as follows: When the present impression\nA awakens the idea _b_ of its past contiguous associate B, how can\nthis occur except through first reviving an image _a_ of its own past\noccurrence. _This_ is the term directly connected with _b_; so that\nthe process instead of being simply A--_b_ is A--_a--b_. Now A and\n_a_ are similars; therefore no association by contiguity can occur\nexcept through a previous association by similarity. The most important\nsupposition here made is that every impression on entering the mind\nmust needs awaken an image of its past self, in the light of which it\nis 'apperceived' or understood, and through the intermediation of which\nit enters into relation with the mind's other objects. This assumption\nis almost universally made; and yet it is hard to find any good reason\nfor it. It first came before us when we were reviewing the facts of\naphasia and mental blindness (see p. 50 ff.). But we then saw no need\nof optical and auditory images to interpret optical and auditory\nsensations by. On the contrary, we agreed that auditory sensations were\nunderstood by us only so far as they awakened _non_-auditory images,\nand optical sensations only so far as they awakened _non_-optical\nimages. In the chapters on Memory, on Reasoning, and on Perception the\nsame assumption will meet us again, and again will have to be rejected\nas groundless. The sensational process A and the ideational process _a_\nprobably occupy essentially the same tracts. When the outer stimulus\ncomes and those tracts vibrate with the sensation A, they discharge\nas directly into the paths which lead to B as when there is no outer\nstimulus and they only vibrate with the idea _a_. To say that the\nprocess A can only reach these paths by the help of the weaker process\n_a_ is like saying that we need a candle to see the sun by. A replaces\n_a_, does all that _a_ does and more; and there is no intelligible\nmeaning, to my mind, in saying that the weaker process coexists with\nthe stronger. I therefore consider that these writers are altogether\nwrong. The only plausible proof they give of the coexistence of _a_\nwith A is when A gives us a _sense of familiarity_ but fails to awaken\nany distinct thought of past contiguous associates. In a later chapter\nI shall consider this case. Here I content myself with saying that it\ndoes not seem conclusive as to the point at issue; and that I still\nbelieve association of coexistent or sequent impressions to be the one\n_elementary_ law.\n*       *       *       *       *\nCONTRAST _has also been held to be an independent agent in\nassociation._ But the reproduction of an object contrasting with one\nalready in the mind is easily explained on our principles. Recent\nwriters, in fact, all reduce it either to similarity or contiguity.\nContrast always presupposes generic similarity; it is only the\n_extremes of a class_ which are contrasted, black and white, not\nblack and sour, or white and prickly. A machinery which reproduces\na similar at all, may reproduce the _opposite_ similar, as well as\nany intermediate term. Moreover, the greater number of contrasts are\nhabitually coupled in speech, young and old, life and death, rich and\npoor, etc., and are, as Dr. Bain says, in everybody's memory.[492]\n*       *       *       *       *\nI trust that the student will now feel that the way to a deeper\nunderstanding of the order of our ideas lies in the direction of\ncerebral physiology. The _elementary_ process of revival can be nothing\nbut the law of habit. Truly the day is distant when physiologists\nshall actually trace from cell-group to cell-group the irradiations\nwhich we have hypothetically invoked. Probably it will never arrive.\nThe schematism we have used is, moreover, taken immediately from the\nanalysis of objects into their elementary parts, and only extended by\nanalogy to the brain. And yet it is only as incorporated in the brain\nthat such a schematism can represent anything _causal_. This is, to my\nmind, the conclusive reason for saying that the order of _presentation\nof the mind's materials_ is due to cerebral physiology alone.\nThe law of accidental prepotency of certain processes over others\nfalls also within the sphere of cerebral probabilities. Granting such\ninstability as the brain-tissue requires, certain points must always\ndischarge more quickly and strongly than others; and this prepotency\nwould shift its place from moment to moment by accidental causes,\ngiving us a perfect mechanical diagram of the capricious play of\nsimilar association in the most gifted mind. The study of dreams\nconfirms this view. The usual abundance of paths of irradiation seems,\nin the dormant brain, reduced. A few only are pervious, and the most\nfantastic sequences occur because the currents run--'like sparks in\nburnt-up paper'--wherever the nutrition of the moment creates an\nopening, but nowhere else.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe _effects of interested attention and volition_ remain. These\nactivities seem to hold fast to certain elements, and by emphasizing\nthem and dwelling on them, to make their associates the only ones which\nare evoked. _This_ is the point at which an anti-mechanical psychology\nmust, if anywhere, make it stand in dealing with association.\nEverything else is pretty certainly due to cerebral laws. My own\nopinion on the question of active attention and spiritual spontaneity\nis expressed elsewhere. But even though there be a mental spontaneity,\nit can certainly not create ideas or summon them _ex abrupto_. Its\npower is limited to _selecting_ amongst those which the associative\nmachinery has already introduced or tends to introduce. If it can\nemphasize, reinforce, or protract for a second either one of these, it\ncan do all that the most eager advocate of free will need demand; for\nit then decides the direction of the next associations by making them\nhinge upon the emphasized term; and determining in this wise the course\nof the man's thinking, it also determines his acts.\nTHE HISTORY OF OPINION CONCERNING ASSOCIATION\nmay be briefly glanced at ere we end the chapter.[493] Aristotle seems\nto have caught both the facts and the principle of explanation; but\nhe did not expand his views, and it was not till the time of Hobbes\nthat the matter was again touched on in a definite way. Hobbes first\nformulated the problem of the succession of our thoughts. He writes in\nLeviathan, chapter iii, as follows:\n\"By consequence, or train of thoughts, I understand that succession\nof one thought to another which is called, to distinguish it from\ndiscourse in words, _mental discourse_. When a man thinketh on\nanything whatsoever, his next thought after is not altogether so\ncasual as it seems to be. Not every thought to every thought succeeds\nindifferently. But as we have no imagination, whereof we have not\nformerly had sense, in whole or in parts; so we have no transition\nfrom one imagination to another, whereof we never had the like before\nin our senses. The reason whereof is this. All fancies are motions\nwithin us, relics of those made in the sense: and those motions that\nimmediately succeeded one another in the sense continue also together\nafter sense: insomuch as the former coming again to take place, and\nbe predominant, the latter followeth, by coherence of the matter\nmoved, in such manner, as water upon a plane table is drawn which way\nany one part of it is guided by the finger. But because in sense,\nto one and the same thing perceived, sometimes one thing, sometimes\nanother succeedeth, it comes to pass in time that, in the imagining of\nanything, there is no certainty what we shall imagine next; only this\nis certain, it shall be something that succeeded the same before, at\none time or another. This train of thoughts, or mental discourse, is\nof two sorts. The first is _unguided, without design,_ and inconstant;\nwherein there is no passionate thought, to govern and direct those\nthat follow, to itself, as the end and scope of some desire, or other\npassion.... The second is more constant; as being _regulated_ by\nsome desire and design. For the impression made by such things as we\ndesire, or fear, is strong and permanent, or, if it cease for a time,\nof quick return: so strong is it, sometimes, as to hinder and break\nour sleep. From desire ariseth the thought of some means we have\nseen produce the like of that which we aim at; and from the thought\nof that, the thought of means to that mean; and so continually, till\nwe come to some beginning within our own power. And because the end,\nby the greatness of the impression, comes often to mind, in case our\nthoughts begin to wander, they are quickly again reduced into the way:\nwhich observed by one of the seven wise men, made him give men this\nprecept, which is now worn out, _Respite finem_; that is to say, in\nall your actions, look often upon what you would have, as the thing\nthat directs all your thoughts in the way to attain it.\n\"The train of regulated thoughts is of two kinds; one, when of an\neffect imagined we seek the causes, or means that produce it: and this\nis common to man and beast. The other is, when imagining anything\nwhatsoever, we seek all the possible effects that can by it be\nproduced; that is to say, we imagine what we can do with it, when we\nhave it. Of which I have not at any time seen any sign, but in man\nonly; for this is a curiosity hardly incident to the nature of any\nliving creature that has no other passion but sensual, such as are\nhunger, thirst, lust, and anger. In sum, the discourse of the mind,\nwhen it is governed by design, is nothing but _seeking_ or the faculty\nof invention, which the Latins called _sagacitas_, and _sollertia_; a\nhunting out of the causes, of some effect, present or past; or of the\neffects, of some present or past cause.\"\nThe most important passage after this of Hobbes is Hume's:\n\"As all simple ideas may be separated by the imagination, and may\nbe united again in what form it pleases, nothing would be more\nunaccountable than the operations of that faculty, were it not guided\nby some universal principles, which render it, in some measure,\nuniform with itself in all times and places. Were ideas entirely loose\nand unconnected, chance alone would join them; and 'tis impossible the\nsame simple ideas should fall regularly into complex ones (as they\ncommonly do) without some bond of union among them, some associating\nquality, by which one idea naturally introduces another. This uniting\nprinciple among ideas is not to be considered as an inseparable\nconnection; for that has been already excluded from the imagination.\nNor yet are we to conclude that without it the mind cannot join two\nideas; for nothing is more free than that faculty: but we are only to\nregard it as a gentle force, which commonly prevails, and is the cause\nwhy, among other things, languages so nearly correspond to each other;\nnature in a manner pointing to every one those simple ideas which are\nmost proper to be united in a complex one. The qualities from which\nthis association arises, and by which the mind is after this manner\nconveyed from one idea to another, are three, viz., RESEMBLANCE,\nCONTIGUITY in time or place, and CAUSE and EFFECT.\n\"I believe it will not be very necessary to prove that these qualities\nproduce an association among ideas, and upon the appearance of one\nidea naturally introduce another. 'Tis plain that in the course of our\nthinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination\nruns easily from one idea to any other that _resembles_ it, and that\nthis quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association.\n'Tis likewise evident, that as the senses, in changing their objects,\nare necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they\nlie _contiguous_ to each other, the imagination must by long custom\nacquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space\nand time in conceiving its objects. As to the connection that is\nmade by the relation of _cause and effect_, we shall have occasion\nafterwards to examine it to the bottom, and therefore shall not at\npresent insist upon it. 'Tis sufficient to observe that there is no\nrelation which produces a stronger connection in the fancy, and makes\none idea more readily recall another, than the relation of cause and\neffect betwixt their objects.... These are therefore the principles\nof union or cohesion among our simple ideas, and in the imagination\nsupply the place of that inseparable connection by which they are\nunited in our memory. Here is a kind of ATTRACTION, which in the\nmental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in\nthe natural, and to show itself in as many and as various forms. Its\neffects are everywhere conspicuous; but as to its causes, they are\nmostly unknown, and must be resolved into _original_ qualities of\nhuman nature, which I pretend not to explain.\"[494]\nHume did not, however, any more than Hobbes, follow out the effects of\nwhich he speaks, and the task of popularizing the notion of association\nand making an effective school based on association of ideas alone was\nreserved for Hartley[495] and James Mill.[496] These authors traced\nminutely the presence of association in all the cardinal notions and\noperations of the mind. The several 'faculties' of the Mind were\ndispossessed; the one principle of association between ideas did all\ntheir work. As Priestley says:\n\"Nothing is requisite to make any man whatever he is, but a sentient\nprinciple with this single law.... Not only all our intellectual\npleasures and pains but all the phenomena of memory, imagination,\nvolition, reasoning and every other mental affection and operation,\nare but different modes or cases of the association of ideas.\"[497]\nAn eminent French psychologist, M. Ribot, repeats Hume's comparison of\nthe law of association with that of gravitation, and goes on to say:\n\"It is remarkable that this discovery was made so late. Nothing is\nsimpler, apparently, than to notice that this law of association is\nthe truly fundamental, irreducible phenomenon of our mental life;\nthat it is at the bottom of all our acts; that it permits of no\nexception; that neither dream, revery, mystic ecstasy, nor the most\nabstract reasoning can exist without it; that its suppression would be\nequivalent to that of thought itself. Nevertheless no ancient author\nunderstood it, for one cannot seriously maintain that a few scattered\nlines in Aristotle and the Stoics constitute a theory and clear view\nof the subject. It is to Hobbes, Hume, and Hartley that we must\nattribute the origin of these studies on the connection of our ideas.\nThe discovery of the ultimate law of our psychologic acts has this,\nthen, in common with many other discoveries: it came late and seems so\nsimple that it may justly astonish us.\n\"Perhaps it is not superfluous to ask in what this manner of\nexplanation is superior to the current theory of Faculties.[498] The\nmost extended usage consists, as we know, in dividing intellectual\nphenomena into classes, in separating those which differ, in grouping\ntogether those of the same nature and in giving to these a common name\nand in attributing them to the same cause; it is thus that we have\ncome to distinguish those diverse aspects of intelligence which are\ncalled judgment, reasoning, abstraction, perception, etc. This method\nis precisely the one followed in Physics, where the words caloric,\nelectricity, gravity, designate the unknown causes of certain groups\nof phenomena. If one thus never forgets that the diverse faculties are\nonly the unknown causes of known phenomena, that they are simply a\nconvenient means of classifying the facts and speaking of them, if one\ndoes not fall into the common fault of making out of them substantial\nentities, creations which now agree, now disagree, so forming in the\nintelligence a little republic; then, we can see nothing reprehensible\nin this distribution into faculties, conformable as it is to the\nrules of a sound method and of a good natural classification. In what\nthen is Mr. Bain's procedure superior to the method of the faculties?\nIt is that the latter is simply a _classification_ while his is an\n_explanation_. Between the psychology which traces intellectual facts\nback to certain faculties, and that which reduces them to the single\nlaw of association, there is, according to our way of thinking, the\nsame difference that we find in Physics between those who attribute\nits phenomena to five or six causes, and those who derive gravity\ncaloric, light, etc., from motion. The system of the faculties\nexplains nothing because each one of them is only a _flatus vocis_\nwhich is of value merely through the phenomena which it contains, and\nsignifies nothing more than these phenomena. The new theory, on the\ncontrary, shows that the different processes of intelligence are only\ndiverse cases of a single law; that imagination, deduction, induction,\nperception, etc., are but so many determinate ways in which ideas\nmay combine with each other; and that the differences of faculties\nare only differences of association. It _explains_ all intellectual\nfacts, certainly not after the manner of Metaphysics which demands\nthe ultimate and absolute reason of things; but after the manner of\nPhysics which seeks only their secondary and immediate cause.\"[499]\nThe inexperienced reader may be glad of a brief indication of the\nmanner in which all the different mental operations may be conceived to\nconsist of images of sensation associated together.\n_Memory_ is the association of a present image with others known to\nbelong to the past. _Expectation_ the same, with future substituted for\npast. _Fancy_, the association of images without temporal order.\n_Belief_ in anything _not_ present to sense is the very lively,\nstrong, and steadfast association of the image of that thing with some\npresent sensation, so that as long as the sensation persists the image\ncannot be excluded from the mind.\n_Judgment_ is 'transferring the idea of _truth_ by association from one\nproposition to another that resembles it.'[500]\n_Reasoning_ is the perception that \"whatever has any mark has that\nwhich it is a mark of\"; in the concrete case the mark or middle term\nbeing always _associated_ with each of the other terms and so serving\nas a link by which they are themselves indirectly associated together.\nThis same kind of transfer of a sensible experience associated\nwith another to a third also associated with that other, serves to\nexplain emotional facts. When we are pleased or hurt we express it,\nand the expression associates itself with the feeling. Hearing the\nsame expression from another revives the associated feeling, and we\n_sympathize_, i.e. grieve or are glad with him.\nThe other social affections, _Benevolence, Conscientiousness,\nAmbition,_ etc., arise in like manner by the transfer of the bodily\npleasure experienced as a reward for social service, and hence\nassociated with it, to the act of service itself, the link of reward\nbeing dropped out. Just so _Avarice_ when the miser transfers the\nbodily pleasures associated with the spending of money to the money\nitself, dropping the link of spending.\n_Fear_ is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience\nwith the thing feared, to the thought of the thing, with the precise\nfeatures of the hurt left out. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly\nimagining his bite.\n_Love_ is the association of the agreeableness of certain sensible\nexperiences with the idea of the object capable of affording them.\nThe experiences themselves may cease to be distinctly imagined after\nthe notion of their pleasure has been transferred to the object,\nconstituting our love therefor.\n_Volition_ is the association of ideas of muscular motion with the\nideas of those pleasures which the motion produces. The motion at first\noccurs automatically and results in a pleasure unforeseen. The latter\nbecomes so associated with the motion that whenever we think of it the\nidea of the motion arises; and the idea of the motion when vivid causes\nthe motion to occur. This is an act of will.\nNothing is easier than for a philosopher of this school to explain from\nexperience such a notion as that of infinitude.\n\"He sees in it an ordinary manifestation of one of the laws of the\nassociation of ideas,--the law that the idea of a thing irresistibly\nsuggests the idea of any other thing which has been often experienced\nin close conjunction with it, and not otherwise. As we have never\nhad experience of any point of space without other points beyond\nit, nor of any point of time without others following it, the law\nof indissoluble association makes it impossible for us to think of\nany point of space or time, however distant, without having the idea\nirresistibly realized, in imagination, of other points still more\nremote. And thus the supposed original and inherent property of these\ntwo ideas is completely explained and accounted for by the law of\nassociation; and we are enabled to see that if Space or Time were\nreally susceptible of termination, we should be just as unable as we\nnow are to conceive the idea.\"[501]\nThese examples of the Associationist Psychology are with the exception\nof the last, very crudely expressed, but they suffice for our temporary\nneed. Hartley and James Mill[502] improved upon Hume so far as to\nemploy but a single principle of association, that of contiguity or\nhabit. Hartley ignores resemblance, James Mill expressly repudiates it\nin a passage which is assuredly one of the curiosities of literature:\n\"I believe it will be found that we are accustomed to see like things\ntogether. When we see a tree, we generally see more trees than one;\na sheep, more sheep than one; a man, more men than one. From this\nobservation, I think, we may refer resemblance to the law of frequency\n[i.e., contiguity], of which it seems to form only a particular case.\"\nMr. Herbert Spencer has still more recently tried to construct a\nPsychology which ignores Association by Similarity,[503] and in\na chapter, which also is a curiosity, he tries to explain the\nassociation of two ideas by a conscious reference of the first to the\npoint of time when its sensation was experienced, which point of time\nis no sooner thought of than its content, namely, the second idea,\narises. Messrs. Bain and Mill, however, and the immense majority of\ncontemporary psychologists retain both Resemblance and Contiguity as\nirreducible principles of Association.\nProfessor Bain's exposition of association is by common consent\nlooked upon as the best expression of the English school. Perception\nof agreement and difference, retentiveness, and the two sorts of\nassociation, contiguity and similarity, are by him regarded as\nconstituting all that is meant by intellect proper. His pages are\npainstaking and instructive from a descriptive point of view; though,\nafter my own attempt to deal with the subject causally, I can hardly\naward to them any profound _explanatory_ value. Association by\nSimilarity, too much neglected by the British school before Bain,\nreceives from him the most generous exemplification. As an instructive\npassage, the following, out of many equally good, may be chosen to\nquote:\n\"We may have similarity in form with diversity of use, and similarity\nof use with diversity of form. A rope suggests other ropes and\ncords, if we look to the appearance; but looking to the _use_, it\nmay suggest an iron cable, a wooden prop, an iron girding, a leather\nband, or bevelled gear. In spite of diversity of appearance, the\nsuggestion turns on what answers a common end. If we are very much\nattracted by sensible appearances, there will be the more difficulty\nin recalling things that agree only in the use; if, on the other\nhand, we are profoundly sensitive to the one point of practical\nefficiency as a tool, the peculiarities not essential to this will\nbe little noticed, and we shall be ever ready to revive past objects\ncorresponding in use to some one present, although diverse in all\nother circumstances. We become oblivious to the difference between a\nhorse, a steam-engine, and a waterfall, when our minds are engrossed\nwith the one circumstance of moving power. The diversity in these\nhad no doubt for a long time the effect of keeping back their first\nidentification; and to obtuse intellects, this identification might\nhave been for ever impossible. A strong concentration of mind upon the\nsingle peculiarity of mechanical force, and a degree of indifference\nto the general aspect of the things themselves, must conspire with\nthe intellectual energy of resuscitation by similars, in order to\nsummon together in the view three structures so different. We can\nsee, by an instance like this, how new adaptations of existing\nmachinery might arise in the mind of a mechanical inventor. When it\nfirst occurred to a reflecting mind that moving water had a property\nidentical with human or brute force, namely, the property of setting\nother masses in motion, overcoming inertia and resistance,--when the\nsight of the stream suggested through this point of likeness the\npower of the animal,--a new addition was made to the class of prime\nmovers, and when circumstances permitted, this power could become a\nsubstitute for the others. It may seem to the modern understanding,\nfamiliar with water-wheels and drifting rafts, that the similarity\nhere was an extremely obvious one. But if we put ourselves back into\nan early state of mind, when running water affected the mind by its\nbrilliancy, its roar, and irregular devastation, we may easily suppose\nthat to identify this with animal muscular energy was by no means an\nobvious effect. Doubtless when a mind arose, insensible by natural\nconstitution to the superficial aspects of things, and having withal\na great stretch of identifying intellect, such a comparison would\nthen be possible. We may pursue the same example one stage further,\nand come to the discovery of steam power, or the identification of\nexpanding vapor with the previously known sources of mechanical\nforce. To the common eye, for ages, vapor presented itself as clouds\nin the sky; or as a hissing noise at the spout of a kettle, with the\nformation of a foggy curling cloud at a few inches' distance. The\nforcing up of the lid of a kettle may also have been occasionally\nobserved. But how long was it ere any one was struck with the\nparallelism of this appearance with a blast of wind, a rush of water,\nor an exertion of animal muscle? The discordance was too great to be\nbroken through by such a faint and limited amount of likeness. In one\nmind, however, the identification did take place, and was followed\nout into its consequences. The likeness had occurred to other minds\npreviously, but not with the same results. Such minds must have been\nin some way or other distinguished above the millions of mankind; and\nwe are now endeavoring to give the explanation of their superiority.\nThe intellectual character of Watt contained all the elements\npreparatory to a great stroke of similarity in such a case;--a high\nsusceptibility, both by nature and by education, to the mechanical\nproperties of bodies; ample previous knowledge or familiarity; and\nindifference to the superficial and sensational effects of things.\nIt is not only possible, however, but exceedingly probable, that\nmany men possessed all these accomplishments; they are of a kind not\ntranscending common abilities. They would in some degree attach to a\nmechanical education almost as a matter of course. That the discovery\nwas not sooner made supposes that something farther, and not of common\noccurrence, was necessary; and this additional endowment appears to be\nthe identifying power of Similarity in general; the tendency to detect\nlikeness in the midst of disparity and disguise. This supposition\naccounts for the fact, and is consistent with the known intellectual\ncharacter of the inventor of the steam-engine.\"[504]\nDr. Hodgson's account of association is by all odds the best yet\npropounded in English.[505] All these writers hold more or less\nexplicitly to the notion of atomistic 'ideas' which recur. In Germany,\nthe same mythological supposition has been more radically grasped,\nand carried out to a still more logical, if more repulsive, extreme,\nby Herbart[506] and his followers, who until recently may be said to\nhave reigned almost supreme in their native country.[507] For Herbart\neach idea is a permanently existing entity, the entrance whereof into\nconsciousness is but an accidental determination of its being. So far\nas it succeeds in occupying the theatre of consciousness, it crowds\nout another idea previously there. This act of inhibition gives it,\nhowever, a sort of hold on the other representation which on all later\noccasions facilitates its following the other into the mind. The\ningenuity with which most special cases of association are formulated\nin this mechanical language of struggle and inhibition, is great, and\nsurpasses in analytic thoroughness anything that has been done by the\nBritish school. This, however, is a doubtful merit, in a case where\nthe elements dealt with are artificial; and I must confess that to my\nmind there is something almost hideous in the glib Herbartian jargon\nabout _Vorstellungsmassen_ and their _Hemmungen_ and _Hemmungssummen_,\nand _sinken_ and _erheben_ and _schweben_, and _Verschmelzungen_\nand _Complexionen_. Herr Lipps, the most recent systematic German\nPsychologist, has, I regret to say, carried out the theory of ideas\nin a way which the great originality, learning, and acuteness he\nshows make only the more regrettable.[508] Such elaborately artificial\nconstructions are, it seems to me, only a burden and a hindrance, not a\nhelp, to our science.[509]\nIn French, M. Rabier in his chapter on Association,[510] handles the\nsubject more vigorously and acutely than any one. His treatment of it,\nthough short, seems to me for general soundness to rank second only to\nHodgson's.\nIn the last chapter we already invoked association to account for\nthe effects of use in improving discrimination. In later chapters\nwe shall see abundant proof of the immense part which it plays in\nother processes, and shall then readily admit that few principles of\nanalysis, in any science, have proved more fertile than this one,\nhowever vaguely formulated it often may have been. Our own attempt to\nformulate it more definitely, and to escape the usual confusion between\ncausal agencies and relations merely known, must not blind us to the\nimmense services of those by whom the confusion was unfelt. From this\npractical point of view it would be a true _ignoratio elenchi_ to\nflatter one's self that one has dealt a heavy blow at the psychology of\nassociation, when one has exploded the theory of atomistic ideas, or\nshown that contiguity and similarity between ideas can only be there\nafter association is done.[511] The whole body of the associationist\npsychology remains standing after you have translated 'ideas' into\n'objects,' on the one hand, and 'brain-processes' on the other; and the\nanalysis of faculties and operations is as conclusive in these terms as\nin those traditionally used.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[463] The theory propounded in this chapter, and a good many pages of\nthe text, were originally published in the Popular Science Monthly for\nMarch, 1880.\n[464] Compare Renouvier's criticism of associationism in his Essais de\nCritique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Logique, ii, p. 493 foll.\n[465] Unless the name belong to a rapidly uttered sentence, when no\nsubstantive image may have time to arise.\n[466] In his observations he says that time was lost in mentally taking\nin the word which was the cue, \"owing to the quiet unobtrusive way in\nwhich I found it necessary to bring it into view, so as not to distract\nthe thoughts. Moreover, a substantive standing by itself is usually the\nequivalent of too abstract an idea for us to conceive properly without\ndelay. Thus it is very difficult to get a quick conception of the word\n'carriage,' because there are so many different kinds--two-wheeled,\nfour-wheeled, open and closed, and in so many different possible\npositions, that the mind possibly hesitates amidst an obscure sense of\nmany alternations that cannot blend together. But limit the idea to say\na landau, and the mental association declares itself more quickly.\"\n(Inquiries, etc., p. 190.)\n[467] Physiol. Psych., ii, 280 fol.\n[468] For interesting remarks on the sorts of things associated, in\nthese experiments, with the prompting word, see Galton, _op. cit._ pp.\n185-203, and Trautscholdt in Wundt's Psychologische Studien, i, 213.\n[469] Mind, xi, 64-5.\n[470] This value is much smaller than that got by Wundt as above. No\nreason for the difference is suggested by Mr. Cattell. Wundt calls\nattention to the fact that the figures found by him give an average,\n0.720'', exactly equal to the _time interval_ which in his experiments\n(_vide infra_, chapter on Time) was reproduced without error either\nway, and to that required, according to the Webers, for the legs to\nswing in rapid locomotion. \"It is not improbable,\" he adds, \"that\nthis psychic constant, of the mean association-time and of the most\ncorrect appreciation of a time-interval, may have been developed under\nthe influence of the most usual bodily movements, which also have\ndetermined the manner in which we tend to subdivide rhythmically longer\nperiods of time.\" (Physiol. Psych., ii, 286). The _rapprochement_\nis of that tentative sort which it is no harm for psychologists to\nmake, provided they recollect how very fictitious and incomparable\nmutually all these averages derived from different observers, working\nunder different conditions, are. Mr. Cattell's figure throws Wundt's\ningenious parallel entirely out of line.--The only measurements of\nassociation-time which so far seem likely to have much theoretic\nimportance are a few made on insane patients by Von Tschisch (Mendel's\nNeurologisches Centralblatt, 15 Mai, 1885, 3 Jhrg., p. 217). The\nsimple reaction time was found about normal in three patients, one\nwith progressive paralysis, one with inveterate mania of persecution,\none recovering from ordinary mania. In the convalescent maniac and\nthe paralytic, however, the association-time was hardly half as much\nas Wundt's normal figure (0.28'' and 0.23'' instead of 0.7'--smaller\nalso than Cattell's), whilst in the sufferer from delusions of\npersecution and hallucinations it was twice as great as normal (1.39''\ninstead of 0.7''). This latter patient's time was sixfold that of the\nparalytic. Herr von Tschisch remarks on the connection of the short\ntimes with diminished power for clear and consistent processes of\nthought, and on that of the long times with the persistent fixation\nof the attention upon monotonous objects (delusions). Miss Marie\nWalitzky (Revue Philosophique, xxviii, 583) has carried Von Tschisch's\nobservations still farther, making 18,000 measurements in all. She\nfound association-time increased in paralytic dementia and diminished\ninmania. Choice time, on the contrary, is increased in mania.\n[471] Mind, xii, 67-74.\n[472] Compare Bain's law of Association by Contiguity: \"Actions,\nSensations, and States of Feeling, occurring together or in close\nsuccession, tend to grow together, or cohere, in such a way that, when\nany one of them is afterwards presented to the mind, the others are\napt to be brought up in idea\" (Senses and Intellect, p. 327). Compare\nalso Hartley's formulation: \"Any sensations A, B, C, etc., by being\nassociated with one another a sufficient Number of Times, get such a\npower over the corresponding Ideas _a, b, c,_ etc., that anyone of the\nsensations A, when impressed alone, shall be able to excite in the Mind\n_b, c,_ etc., the ideas of the rest.\" (Observations on Man, part i,\nchap. i, \u00a7 2, Prop. x.) The statement in the text differs from these\nin holding fast to the objective point of view. It is _things_, and\nobjective _properties in things_, which are associated in our thought.\n[473] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 9th Ed., article Psychology, p. 60. col.\n2.\n[474] Physiol. Psych., 2d ed. ii, 300.\n[475] The difficulty here as with habit _\u00fcberhaupt_ is in seeing\nhow new paths come _first_ to be formed (cf. above, p. 109).\nExperience shows that a new path _is_ formed between centres for\nsensible impressions whenever these vibrate together or in rapid\nsuccession. A child sees a certain bottle and hears it called 'milk,'\nand thenceforward thinks the name when he again sees the bottle.\nBut why the successive or simultaneous excitement of two centres\nindependently stimulated from without, one by sight and the other\nby hearing, _should_ result in a path between them, one does not\nimmediately see. We can only make hypotheses. Any hypothesis of the\nspecific mode of their formation which tallies well with the observed\nfacts of association will be in so far forth credible, in spite\nof possible obscurity. Herr M\u00fcnsterberg thinks (Beitr\u00e4ge zur exp.\nPsychologie, Heft i, p. 132) that between centres excited successively\nfrom without no path ought to be formed, and that consequently all\ncontiguous association is between _simultaneous_ experiences. Mr. Ward\n(_loc. cit._) thinks, on the contrary, that it can only be between\n_successive_ experiences: \"The association of objects simultaneously\npresented can be resolved into an association of objects successively\nattended to.... It seems hardly possible to mention a case in which\nattention to the associated objects could not have been successive. In\nfact, an aggregate of objects on which attention could be focussed at\nonce would be already associated.\" Between these extreme possibilities,\nI have refrained from deciding in the text, and have described\ncontiguous association as holding between both successively and\ncoexistently presented objects. The physiological question as to how\nwe may conceive the paths to originate had better be postponed till it\ncomes to us again in the chapter on the Will, where we can treat it in\na broader way. It is enough here to have called attention to it as a\nserious problem.\n[476] Essay, bk. ii, chap. xxxiii, \u00a7 6. Compare Hume, who, like Locke,\nonly uses the principle to account for unreasonable and obstructive\nmental associations:\n\"'Twould have been easy to have made an imaginary dissection of the\nbrain, and have shown why, upon our conception of any idea, the animal\nspirits run into all the contiguous traces, and rouse up the other\nideas that are related to it. But though I have neglected any advantage\nwhich I might have drawn from this topic in explaining the relations of\nideas, I am afraid I must here have recourse to it, in order to account\nfor the mistakes that arise from these relations. I shall therefore\nobserve, that as the mind is endowed with a power of exciting any idea\nit pleases; whenever it dispatches the spirits into that region of the\nbrain in which the idea is placed, these spirits always excite the\nidea, when they run precisely into the proper traces, and rummage that\ncell which belongs to the idea. But as their motion is seldom direct,\nand naturally turns a little to the one side or the other: for this\nreason the animal spirits, falling into the contiguous traces, present\nother related ideas in lieu of that which the mind desired at first\nto survey. This change we are not always sensible of; but continuing\nstill the same train of thought, make use of the related idea which is\npresented to us, and employ it in our reasoning, as if it were the same\nwith what we demanded. This is the cause of many mistakes and sophisms\nin philosophy; as will naturally be imagined, and as it would be easy\nto show, if there was occasion.\"\n[477] _Op. cit._ prop. xi.\n[478] See Chapter III, pp. 82-5.\n[479] I strongly advise the student to read his Senses and Intellect,\npp. 544-556.\n[480] Time and Space, p. 266. Compare Coleridge: \"The true practical\ngeneral law of association is this: that whatever makes certain parts\nof a total impression more vivid or distinct than the rest will\ndetermine the mind to recall these, in preference to others equally\nlinked together by the common condition of contemporaeity or of\n_contiguity_. But the will itself, by confining and intensifying the\nattention, may arbitrarily give vividness or distinctness to any object\nwhatsoever.\" (Biographia Litteraria, Chap. v.)\n[481] Leviathan, pt. i, chap. iii, _init._\n[482] I refer to a recency of a few hours. Mr. Galton found that\nexperiences from boyhood and youth were more likely to be suggested by\nwords seen at random than experiences of later years. See his highly\ninteresting account of experiments in his Inquiries into Human Faculty,\npp. 191-203.\n[483] For other instances see Wahle, in Vierteljsch. f. Wiss. Phil.,\nix, 144-417 (1885).\n[484] I retain the title of association by similarity in order not to\ndepart from common usage. The reader will observe, however, that my\nnomenclature is not based on the same principle throughout. Impartial\nredintegration connotes neural processes; similarity is an objective\nrelation perceived by the mind; ordinary or mixed association is a\nmerely denotative word. _Total recall, partial recall,_ and _focalized\nrecall,_ of associates, would be better terms. But as the _denotation_\nof the latter word is almost identical with that of association by\nsimilarity, I think it better to sacrifice propriety to popularity, and\nto keep the latter well-worn phrase.\n[485] No one has described this process better than Hobbes: \"Sometimes\na man seeks what he hath lost; and from that place and time wherein\nhe misses it, his mind runs back from place to place and time to time\nto and where and when he had it; that is to say, to find some certain\nand limited time and place, in which to begin a method of seeking.\nAgain, from thence his thoughts run over the same places and times to\nfind what action or other occasion might make him lose it. This we\ncall _Remembrance_, or calling to mind. Sometimes a man knows a place\ndeterminate, within the compass whereof he is to seek; and then his\nthoughts run over all the parts thereof, in the same manner as one\nwould sweep a room to find a jewel, or as a spaniel ranges the field\ntill he find a scent, or as a man should run over the alphabet to start\na rhyme.\" (Leviathan, 165, p. 10.)\n[486] Theory of Practice, vol. i, p. 394.\n[487] _Ibid._ p. 394.\n[488] All association is called redintegration by Hodgson.\n[489] _Ibid._ p. 400. Compare Bain, Emotions and Will, p. 377. \"The\noutgoings of the mind are necessarily random; the end alone is the\nthing that is clear to the view, and with that there is a perception of\nthe fitness of every passing suggestion. The volitional energy keeps\nup the attention on the active search; and the moment that anything in\npoint rises before the mind, it springs upon that like a wild beast\nupon its prey.\"\n[490] Compare what is said of the principle of Similarity by F.

If perceived relations among objects are to be treated as\ngrounds for their appearance before the mind, similarity has of course\nno right to an exclusive, or even to a predominant, place.\n[492] Cf.

Bradley seems to me to have been guilty of something\nvery like this _ignoratio elenchi_ in the, of course, subtle and\nwitty but decidedly long-winded critique of the association of ideas,\ncontained in book ii, part ii, chap. i, of his Principles of Logic.\nCHAPTER XV.[512]\nTHE PERCEPTION OF TIME.\nIn the next two chapters I shall deal with what is sometimes called\ninternal perception, or the perception of _time_, and of events as\noccupying a date therein, especially when the date is a past one, in\nwhich case the perception in question goes by the name of _memory_. To\nremember a thing as past, it is necessary that the notion of 'past'\nshould be one of our 'ideas.' We shall see in the chapter on Memory\nthat many things come to be thought by us as past, not because of any\nintrinsic quality of their own, but rather because they are associated\nwith other things which for us signify pastness. But how do these\nthings get _their_ pastness? What is the _original_ of our experience\nof pastness, from whence we get the meaning of the term? It is this\nquestion which the reader is invited to consider in the present\nchapter. We shall see that we have a constant feeling _sui generis_ of\npastness, to which every one of our experiences in turn falls a prey.\nTo think a thing as past is to think it amongst the objects or in the\ndirection of the objects which at the present moment appear affected\nby this quality. This is the original of our notion of past time, upon\nwhich memory and history build their systems. And in this chapter we\nshall consider this immediate sense of time alone.\nIf the constitution of consciousness were that of a string of bead-like\nsensations and images, all separate,\n\"we never could have any knowledge except that of the present\ninstant. The moment each of our sensations ceased it would be gone\nfor ever; and we should be as if we had never been.... We should be\nwholly incapable of acquiring experience.... Even if our ideas were\nassociated in trains, but only as they are in imagination, we should\nstill be without the capacity of acquiring knowledge. One idea, upon\nthis supposition, would follow another. But that would be all. Each of\nour successive states of consciousness, the moment it ceased, would\nbe gone forever. Each of those momentary states would be our whole\nbeing.\"[513]\nWe might, nevertheless, under these circumstances, _act_ in a rational\nway, provided the mechanism which produced our trains of images\nproduced them in a rational order. We should make appropriate speeches,\nthough unaware of any word except the one just on our lips; we should\ndecide upon the right policy without ever a glimpse of the total\ngrounds of our choice. Our consciousness would be like a glow-worm\nspark, illuminating the point it immediately covered, but leaving all\nbeyond in total darkness. Whether a very highly developed practical\nlife be possible under such conditions as these is more than doubtful;\nit is, however, conceivable.\nI make the fanciful hypothesis merely to set off our real nature by the\ncontrast. Our feelings are not thus contracted, and our consciousness\nnever shrinks to the dimensions of a glow-worm spark. _The knowledge\nof some other part of the stream, past or future, near or remote, is\nalways mixed in with our knowledge of the present thing._\nA simple sensation, as we shall hereafter see, is an abstraction, and\nall our concrete states of mind are representations of objects with\nsome amount of complexity. Part of the complexity is the echo of the\nobjects just past, and, in a less degree, perhaps, the foretaste of\nthose just to arrive. Objects fade out of consciousness slowly. If the\npresent thought is of ABCDEFG, the next one will be of BCDEFGH, and\nthe one after that of CDEFGHI--the lingerings of the past dropping\nsuccessively away, and the incomings of the future making up the loss.\nThese lingerings of old objects, these incomings of new, are the germs\nof memory and expectation, the retrospective and the prospective sense\nof time. They give that continuity to consciousness without which it\ncould not be called a stream.[514]\nTHE SENSIBLE PRESENT HAS DURATION.\nLet any one try, I will not say to arrest, but to notice or attend to,\nthe _present_ moment of time. One of the most baffling experiences\noccurs. Where is it, this present? It has melted in our grasp, fled ere\nwe could touch it, gone in the instant of becoming. As a poet, quoted\nby Mr. Hodgson, says,\n\"Le moment o\u00f9 je parle est d\u00e9j\u00e0 loin de moi,\"\nand it is only as entering into the living and moving organization of\na much wider tract of time that the strict present is apprehended at\nall. It is, in fact, an altogether ideal abstraction, not only never\nrealized in sense, but probably never even conceived of by those\nunaccustomed to philosophic meditation. Reflection leads us to the\nconclusion that it _must_ exist, but that it _does_ exist can never\nbe a fact of our immediate experience. The only fact of our immediate\nexperience is what Mr. E. R. Clay has well called 'the _specious_\npresent.' His words deserve to be quoted in full:[515]\n\"The relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied.\nIts objects are given as being of the present, but the part of\ntime referred to by the datum is a very different thing from the\nconterminous of the past and future which philosophy denotes by the\nname Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a part\nof the past--a recent past--delusively given as being a time that\nintervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named the\nspecious present, and let the past, that is given as being the past,\nbe known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song seem to\nthe listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place\nof a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At\nthe instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time\nmeasured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively\nto human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past,\nthe specious present, the real present, and the future. Omitting the\nspecious present, it consists of three ... nonentities--the past,\nwhich does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their\nconterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to\nus in the fiction of the specious present.\"\nIn short, the practically cognized present is no knife-edge, but\na saddle-back, with a certain breadth of its own on which we sit\nperched, and from which we look in two directions into time. The unit\nof composition of our perception of time is a _duration_, with a bow\nand a stern, as it were--a rearward- and a forward-looking end.[516]\nIt is only as parts of this _duration-block_ that the relation of\n_succession_ of one end to the other is perceived. We do not first feel\none end and then feel the other after it, and from the perception of\nthe succession infer an interval of time between, but we seem to feel\nthe interval of time as a whole, with its two ends embedded in it. The\nexperience is from the outset a synthetic datum, not a simple one; and\nto sensible perception its elements are inseparable, although attention\nlooking back may easily decompose the experience, and distinguish its\nbeginning from its end.\nWhen we come to study the perception of Space, we shall find it\nquite analogous to time in this regard. Date in time corresponds\nto position in space; and although we now mentally construct large\nspaces by mentally imagining remoter and remoter positions, just as\nwe now construct great durations by mentally prolonging a series of\nsuccessive dates, yet the original experience of both space and time is\nalways of something already given as a unit, inside of which attention\nafterward discriminates parts in relation to each other. Without\nthe parts already given as _in_ a time and _in_ a space, subsequent\ndiscrimination of them could hardly do more than perceive them as\n_different_ from each other; it would have no motive for calling the\ndifference temporal order in this instance and spatial position in that.\nAnd just as in certain experiences we may be conscious of an extensive\nspace full of objects, without locating each of them distinctly\ntherein; so, when many impressions follow in excessively rapid\nsuccession in time, although we may be distinctly aware that they\noccupy some duration, and are not simultaneous, we may be quite at\na loss to tell which comes first and which last; or we may even\ninvert their real order in our judgment. In complicated reaction-time\nexperiments, where signals and motions, and clicks of the apparatus\ncome in exceedingly rapid order, one is at first much perplexed in\ndeciding what the order is, yet of the fact of its occupancy of time we\nare never in doubt.\nACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATE OF SHORT DURATIONS.\nWe must now proceed to an account of the _facts_ of time-perception in\ndetail as preliminary to our speculative conclusion. Many of the facts\nare matters of patient experimentation, others of common experience.\nFirst of all, we note a marked _difference between the elementary\nsensations of duration and those of space_. The former have a much\nnarrower range; the time-sense may be called a myopic organ, in\ncomparison with the eye, for example. The eye sees rods, acres, even\nmiles, at a single glance, and these totals it can afterward subdivide\ninto an almost infinite number of distinctly identified parts. The\nunits of duration, on the other hand, which the time-sense is able to\ntake in at a single stroke, are groups of a few seconds, and within\nthese units very few subdivisions--perhaps forty at most, as we\nshall presently see--can be clearly discerned. The durations we have\npractically most to deal with--minutes, hours, and days--have to be\nsymbolically conceived, and constructed by mental addition, after the\nfashion of those extents of hundreds of miles and upward, which in the\nfield of space are beyond the range of most men's practical interests\naltogether. To 'realize' a quarter of a mile we need only look out of\nthe window and _feel_ its length by an act which, though it may in part\nresult from organized associations, yet seems immediately performed. To\nrealize an hour, we must count 'now!--now!--now!--now!--' indefinitely.\nEach 'now' is the feeling of a separate _bit_ of time, and the exact\nsum of the bits never makes a very clear impression on our mind.\nHow many bits can we clearly apprehend at once? Very few if they are\nlong bits, more if they are extremely short, most if they come to us in\ncompound groups, each including smaller bits of its own.\nHearing is the sense by which the subdivision of durations is most\nsharply made. Almost all the experimental work on the time-sense has\nbeen done by means of strokes of sound. How long a series of sounds,\nthen, can we group in the mind so as not to confound it with a longer\nor a shorter series?\nOur spontaneous tendency is to break up any monotonously given series\nof sounds into some sort of a rhythm. We involuntarily accentuate every\nsecond, or third, or fourth beat, or we break the series in still more\nintricate ways. Whenever we thus grasp the impressions in rhythmic\nform, we can identify a longer string of them without confusion.\nEach variety of verse, for example, has its 'law'; and the recurrent\nstresses and sinkings make us feel with peculiar readiness the lack of\na syllable or the presence of one too much. Divers verses may again be\nbound together in the form of a stanza, and we may then say of another\nstanza, \"Its second verse differs by so much from that of the first\nstanza,\" when but for the felt stanza-form the two differing verses\nwould have come to us too separately to be compared at all. But these\nsuperposed systems of rhythm soon reach their limit. In music, as\nWundt[517] says, \"while the measure may easily contain 12 changes of\nintensity of sound (as in 12/8 time), the rhythmical group may embrace\n6 measures, and the period consist of 4, exceptionally of 5 [8?]\ngroups.\"\nWundt and his pupil Dietze have both tried to determine experimentally\nthe _maximal extent of our immediate distinct consciousness for\nsuccessive impressions._\nWundt found[518] that twelve impressions could be distinguished clearly\nas a united cluster, provided they were caught in a certain rhythm\nby the mind, and succeeded each other at intervals not smaller than\n0.3 and not larger than 0.5 of a second. This makes the total time\ndistinctly apprehended to be equal to from 3.6 to 6 seconds.\nDietze[519] gives larger figures. The most favorable intervals for\nclearly catching the strokes were when they came at from 0.3 second\nto 0.18 second apart. _Forty_ strokes might then be remembered as a\nwhole, and identified without error when repeated, provided the mind\ngrasped them in five sub-groups of eight, or in eight sub-groups of\nfive strokes each. When no grouping of the strokes beyond making\n_couples_ of them by the attention was allowed--and practically it was\nfound impossible not to group them in at least this simplest of all\nways--16 was the largest number that could be clearly apprehended as a\nwhole.[520] This would make 40 times 0.8 second, or 12 seconds, to be\nthe _maximum filled duration_ of which we can be both _distinctly and\nimmediately_ aware.\nThe maximum unfilled, or _vacant duration_, seems to lie within the\nsame objective range. Estel and Mehner, also working in Wundt's\nlaboratory, found it to vary from 5 or 6 to 12 seconds, and perhaps\nmore. The differences seemed due to practice rather than to\nidiosyncrasy.[521]\nThese figures may be roughly taken to stand for the most important part\nof what, with Mr. Clay, we called, a few pages back, the _specious\npresent_. The specious present has, in addition, a vaguely vanishing\nbackward and forward fringe; but its nucleus is probably the dozen\nseconds or less that have just elapsed.\nIf these are the maximum, what, then, is the _minimum_ amount of\nduration which we can distinctly feel?\nThe smallest figure experimentally ascertained was by Exner, who\ndistinctly heard the doubleness of two successive clicks of a Savart's\nwheel, and of two successive snaps of an electric spark, when their\ninterval was made as small as about 1/500 of a second.[522]\nWith the eye, perception is less delicate. Two sparks, made to fall\nbeside each other in rapid succession on the centre of the retina,\nceased to be recognized as successive by Exner when their interval fell\nbelow 0.044''.[523]\nWhere, as here, the succeeding impressions are only two in number,\nwe can easiest perceive the interval between them. President Hall,\nwho experimented with a modified Savart's wheel, which gave clicks in\nvarying number and at varying intervals, says:[524]\n\"In order that their discontinuity may be clearly perceived, four or\neven three clicks or beats must be farther apart than two need to be.\nWhen two are easily distinguished, three or four separated by the\nsame interval ... are often confidently pronounced to be two or three\nrespectively. It would be well if observations were so directed as to\nascertain, at least up to ten or twenty, the increase [of interval]\nrequired by each additional click in a series for the sense of\ndiscontinuity to remain constant throughout.\"[525]\nWhere the first impression falls on one sense, and the second on\nanother, the perception of the intervening time tends to be less\ncertain and delicate, and it makes a difference which impression comes\nfirst. Thus, Exner found[526] the smallest perceptible interval to be,\nin seconds:\nFrom sight to touch      0.071\nFrom touch to sight      0.053\nFrom sight to hearing    0.16\nFrom hearing to sight    0.06\nFrom one ear to another  0.064\n_To be conscious of a time interval at all is one thing; to tell\nwhether it be shorter or longer than another interval is a different\nthing._ A number of experimental data are on hand which give us a\nmeasure of the delicacy of this latter perception. The problem is that\nof the _smallest difference between two times_ which we can perceive.\nThe difference is at its minimum when the times themselves are very\nshort. Exner,[527] reacting as rapidly as possible with his foot,\nupon a signal seen by the eye (spark), noted all the reactions which\nseemed to him either slow or fast in the making. He thought thus that\ndeviations of about 1/100 of a second either way from the average were\ncorrectly noticed by him at the time. The average was here 0.1840''.\nHall and Jastrow listened to the intervals between the clicks of\ntheir apparatus. Between two such equal intervals of 4.27'' each, a\nmiddle interval was included, which might be made either shorter or\nlonger than the extremes. \"After the series had been heard two or\neven three times, no impression of the relative length of the middle\ninterval would often exist, and only after hearing the fourth and last\n[repetition of the series] would the judgment incline to the _plus_ or\n_minus_ side. Inserting the variable between two invariable and like\nintervals greatly facilitated judgment, which between two unlike terms\nis far less accurate.\"[528] Three observers in these experiments made\nno error when the middle interval varied 1/60 from the extremes. When\nit varied 1/120, errors occurred, but were few. This would make the\nminimum _absolute_ difference perceived as large as 0.355''.\nThis minimum absolute difference, of course, increases as the times\ncompared grow long. Attempts have been made to ascertain what _ratio_\nit bears to the times themselves. According to Fechner's 'Psychophysic\nLaw' it ought always to bear the same ratio. Various observers,\nhowever, have found this not to be the case.[529] On the contrary,\nvery interesting _oscillations_ in the accuracy of judgment and in the\ndirection of the error--oscillations dependent upon the absolute amount\nof the times compared--have been noticed by all who have experimented\nwith the question. Of these a brief account may be given.\nIn the first place, _in every list of intervals experimented with there\nwill be found what Vierordt calls an_ 'INDIFFERENCE-POINT;' that is to\nsay, an interval which we judge with maximum accuracy, a time which we\ntend to estimate as neither longer or shorter than it really is, and\naway from which, in both directions, errors increase their size.[530]\nThis time varies from one observer to another, but its average is\nremarkably constant, as the following table shows.[531]\nThe times, noted by the ear, and the average indifference-points (given\nin seconds) were, for--\nWundt[532]            0.72\nKollert[533]          0.75\nEstel (probably)      0.75\nMehner                0.71\nStevens[534]          0.71\nMach[535]             0.35\nBuccola (about)[536]  0.40\nThe odd thing about these figures is the recurrence they show in so\nmany men of about three fourths of a second, as the interval of time\nmost easy to catch and reproduce, Odder still, both Estel and Mehner\nfound that _multiples_ of this time were more accurately reproduced\nthan the time-intervals of intermediary length;[537] and Glass found a\ncertain periodicity, with the constant increment of 1.25 sec., in his\nobservations. There would seem thus to exist something like a periodic\nor rhythmic sharpening of our time-sense, of which the period differs\nsomewhat from one observer to the next.\n_Our sense of time_, like other senses, _seems subject to the law of\ncontrast_. It appeared pretty plainly in Estel's observations that an\ninterval sounded shorter if a long one had immediately preceded it, and\nlonger when the opposite was the case.\nLike other senses, too, _our sense of time is sharpened by practice_.\nMehner ascribes almost all the discrepancies between other observers\nand himself to this cause alone.[538]\n_Tracts of time filled_ (with clicks of sound) _seem longer than vacant\nones_ of the same duration, when the latter does not exceed a second or\ntwo.[539] This, which reminds one of what happens with spaces seen by\nthe eye, becomes reversed when longer times are taken. It is, perhaps,\nin accordance with this law that a _loud_ sound, limiting a short\ninterval of time, makes it appear longer, a _slight_ sound shorter. In\ncomparing intervals marked out by sounds, we must take care to keep the\nsounds uniform.[540]\n*       *       *       *       *\nThere is a certain emotional _feeling_ accompanying the intervals\nof time, as is well known in music. _The sense of haste goes with\none measure of rapidity, that of delay with another;_ and these two\nfeelings harmonize with different mental moods. Vierordt listened\nto series of strokes performed by a metronome at rates varying from\n40 to 200 a minute, and found that they very naturally fell into\nseven categories, from 'very slow' to 'very fast.'[541] Each category\nof feeling included the intervals following each other within a\ncertain range of speed, and no others. This is a qualitative, not\na quantitative judgment--an \u00e6sthetic judgment, in fact. The middle\ncategory, of speed that was neutral, or, as he calls it, 'adequate,'\ncontained intervals that were grouped about 0.62 second, and Vierordt\nsays that this made what one might almost call an _agreeable_ time.[542]\nThe feeling of time and accent in music, of rhythm, is quite\nindependent of that of melody. Tunes with marked rhythm can be readily\nrecognized when simply drummed on the table with the finger-tips.\nWE HAVE NO SENSE FOR EMPTY TIME.\nAlthough subdividing the time by beats of sensation aids our accurate\nknowledge of the amount of it that elapses, such subdivision does not\nseem at the first glance essential to our perception of its flow.\nLet one sit with closed eyes and, abstracting entirely from the\nouter world, attend exclusively to the passage of time, like one who\nwakes, as the poet says, \"to hear time flowing in the middle of the\nnight, and all things moving to a day of doom.\" There seems under\nsuch circumstances as these no variety in the material content of our\nthought, and what we notice appears, if anything, to be the pure series\nof durations budding, as it were, and growing beneath our indrawn\ngaze. Is this really so or not? The question is important, for, if the\nexperience be what it roughly seems, we have a sort of special sense\nfor pure time--a sense to which empty duration is an adequate stimulus;\nwhile if it be an illusion, it must be that our perception of time's\nflight, in the experiences quoted, is due to the _filling_ of the time,\nand to our _memory_ of a content which it had a moment previous, and\nwhich we feel to agree or disagree with its content now.\nIt takes but a small exertion of introspection to show that the\nlatter alternative is the true one, and that _we can no more intuit\na duration than we can intuit an extension, devoid of all sensible\ncontent_. Just as with closed eyes we perceive a dark visual field\nin which a curdling play of obscurest luminosity is always going on;\nso, be we never so abstracted from distinct outward impressions, we\nare always inwardly immersed in what Wundt has somewhere called the\ntwilight of our general consciousness. Our heart-beats, our breathing,\nthe pulses of our attention, fragments of words or sentences that pass\nthrough our imagination, are what people this dim habitat. Now, all\nthese processes are rhythmical, and are apprehended by us, as they\noccur, in their totality; the breathing and pulses of attention, as\ncoherent successions, each with its rise and fall; the heart-beats\nsimilarly, only relatively far more brief; the words not separately,\nbut in connected groups. In short, empty our minds as we may, some\nform of _changing process_ remains for us to feel, and cannot be\nexpelled. And along with the sense of the process and its rhythm goes\nthe sense of the length of time it lasts. Awareness of _change_ is\nthus the condition on which our perception of time's flow depends; but\nthere exists no reason to suppose that empty time's own changes are\nsufficient for the awareness of change to be aroused. The change must\nbe of some concrete sort--an outward or inward sensible series, or a\nprocess of attention or volition.[543]\nAnd here again we have an analogy with space. The earliest form of\ndistinct space-perception is undoubtedly that of a movement over\nsome one of our sensitive surfaces, and this movement is originally\ngiven as a simple whole of feeling, and is only decomposed into its\nelements--successive positions successively occupied by the moving\nbody--when our education in discrimination is much advanced. But a\nmovement is a change, a process; so we see that in the time-world\nand the space-world alike the first known things are not elements,\nbut combinations, not separate units, but wholes already formed.\nThe condition of _being_ of the wholes may be the elements; but the\ncondition of our _knowing_ the elements is our having already felt the\nwholes as wholes.\nIn the experience of watching empty time flow--'empty' to be taken\nhereafter in the relative sense just set forth--we tell it off in\npulses. We say 'now! now! now!' or we count 'more! more! more!' as we\nfeel it bud. This composition out of units of duration is called the\nlaw of time's _discrete flow_. The discreteness is, however, merely due\nto the fact that our successive acts of _recognition_ or _apperception_\nof _what_ it is are discrete. The sensation is as continuous as any\nsensation can be. All continuous sensations are _named_ in beats. We\nnotice that a certain finite 'more' of them is passing or already past.\nTo adopt Hodgson's image, the sensation is the measuring-tape, the\nperception the dividing-engine which stamps its length. As we listen\nto a steady sound, we _take it in_ in discrete pulses of recognition,\ncalling it successively 'the same! the same! the same!' The case stands\nno otherwise with time.\nAfter a small number of beats our impression of the amount we have\ntold off becomes quite vague. Our only way of knowing it accurately\nis by counting, or noticing the clock, or through some other symbolic\nconception.[544] When the times exceed hours or days, the conception\nis absolutely symbolic. We think of the amount we mean either solely\nas a _name_, or by running over a few salient _dates_ therein, with\nno pretence of imagining the full durations that lie between them.\nNo one has anything like a _perception_ of the greater length of the\ntime between now and the first century than of that between now and\nthe tenth. To an historian, it is true, the longer interval will\nsuggest a host of additional dates and events, and so appear a more\n_multitudinous_ thing. And for the same reason most people will think\nthey directly perceive the length of the past fortnight to exceed that\nof the past week. But there is properly no comparative time _intuition_\nin these cases at all. It is but dates and events. _representing_ time;\ntheir abundance _symbolizing_ its length. I am sure that this is so,\neven where the times compared are no more than an hour or so in length.\nIt is the same with Spaces of many miles, which we always compare with\neach other by the numbers which measure them.[545]\nFrom this we pass naturally to speak of certain familial variations\nin our estimation of lengths of time. _In general, a time filled with\nvaried and interesting experiences seems short in passing, but long as\nwe look back. On the other hand, a tract of time empty of experiences\nseems long in passing, but in retrospect short._ A week of travel and\nsight-seeing may subtend an angle more like three weeks in the memory;\nand a month of sickness hardly yields more memories than a day. The\nlength in retrospect depends obviously on the multitudinousness of the\nmemories which the time affords. Many objects, events, changes, many\nsubdivisions, immediately widen the view as we look back. Emptiness,\nmonotony, familiarity, make it shrivel up. In Von Holtei's 'Vagabonds'\none Anton is described as revisiting his native village.\n\"Seven years,\" he exclaims, \"seven years since I ran away! More like\nseventy it seems, so much has happened. I cannot think of it all\nwithout becoming dizzy--at any rate not now. And yet again, when I\nlook at the village, at the church-tower, it seems as if I could\nhardly have been seven days away.\"\nProf. Lazarus[546] (from whom I borrow this quotation), thus explains\nboth of these contrasted illusions by our principle of the awakened\nmemories being multitudinous or few:\n\"The circle of experiences, widely extended, rich in variety, which\nhe had in view on the day of his leaving the village rises now in his\nmind as its image lies before him. And with it--in rapid succession\nand violent motion, not in chronologic order, or from chronologic\nmotives, but suggesting each other by all sorts of connections--arise\nmassive images of all his rich vagabondage and roving life. They roll\nand wave confusedly together, first perhaps one from the first year,\nthen from the sixth, soon from the second, again from the fifth, the\nfirst, etc., until it seems as if seventy years must have been there,\nand he reels with the fulness of his vision.... Then the inner eye\nturns away from all this past. The outer one turns to the village,\nespecially to the church-tower. The sight of it calls back the old\nsight of it, so that the consciousness is filled with that alone, or\nalmost alone. The one vision compares itself with the other, and looks\nso near, so unchanged, that it seems as if only a week of time could\nhave come between.\"\n_The same space of time seems shorter as we grow older_--that is, the\ndays, the months, and the years do so; whether the hours do so is\ndoubtful, and the minutes and seconds to all appearance remain about\nthe same.\n\"Whoever counts many lustra in his memory need only question himself\nto find that the last of these, the past five years, have sped much\nmore quickly than the preceding periods of equal amount. Let any one\nremember his last eight or ten school years: it is the space of a\ncentury. Compare with them the last eight or ten years of life: it is\nthe space of an hour.\"\nSo writes Prof. Paul Janet,[547] and gives a solution which can hardly\nbe said to diminish the mystery. There is a law, he says, by which\nthe apparent length of an interval at a given epoch of a man's life\nis proportional to the total length of the life itself. A child of 10\nfeels a year as 1/10 of his whole life--a man of 50 as 1/50, the whole\nlife meanwhile apparently preserving a constant length. This formula\nroughly expresses the phenomena, it is true, but cannot possibly be\nan elementary psychic law; and it is certain that, in great part at\nleast, the foreshortening of the years as we grow older is due to\nthe monotony of memory's content, and the consequent simplification\nof the backward-glancing view. In youth we may have an absolutely\nnew experience, subjective or objective, every hour of the day.\nApprehension is vivid, retentiveness strong, and our recollections of\nthat time, like those of a time spent in rapid and interesting travel,\nare of something intricate, multitudinous, and long-drawn-out. But\nas each passing year converts some of this experience into automatic\nroutine which we hardly note at all, the days and the weeks smooth\nthemselves out in recollection to contentless units, and the years grow\nhollow and collapse.\nSo much for the apparent shortening of tracts of time in _retrospect_.\nThey shorten _in passing_ whenever we are so fully occupied with\ntheir content as not to note the actual time itself. A day full of\nexcitement, with no pause, is said to pass 'ere we know it.' On the\ncontrary, a day full of waiting, of unsatisfied desire for change, will\nseem a small eternity. _T\u00e6dium, ennui, Langweile, boredom,_ are words\nfor which, probably, every language known to man has its equivalent.\nIt comes about whenever, from the relative emptiness of content\nof a tract of time, we grow attentive to the passage of the time\nitself. Expecting, and being ready for, a new impression to succeed;\nwhen it fails to come, we get an empty time instead of it; and such\nexperiences, ceaselessly renewed, make us most formidably aware of the\nextent of the mere time itself.[548] Close your eyes and simply wait\nto hear somebody tell you that a minute has elapsed. The full length\nof your leisure with it seems incredible. You engulf yourself into\nits bowels as into those of that interminable first week of an ocean\nvoyage, and find yourself wondering that history can have overcome\nmany such periods in its course. All because you attend so closely\nto the mere feeling of the time _per se_, and because your attention\nto that is susceptible of such fine-grained successive subdivision.\nThe _odiousness_ of the whole experience comes from its insipidity;\nfor _stimulation_ is the indispensable requisite for pleasure in an\nexperience, and the feeling of bare time is the least stimulating\nexperience we can have.[549] The sensation of t\u00e6edium is a _protest_,\nsays Volkmann, against the entire present.\nExactly parallel variations occur in our consciousness of space. A\nroad we walk back over, hoping to find at each step an object we have\ndropped, seems to us longer than when we walked over it the other way.\nA space we measure by pacing appears longer than one we traverse with\nno thought of its length. And in general an amount of space attended to\nin itself leaves with us more impression of spaciousness than one of\nwhich we only note the content.[550]\nI do not say that _everything_ in these fluctuations of estimate can be\naccounted for by the time's content being crowded and interesting, or\nsimple and tame. Both in the shortening of time by old age and in its\nlengthening by _ennui_ some deeper cause _may_ be at work. This cause\ncan only be ascertained, if it exist, by finding out _why we perceive\ntime at all_. To this inquiry let us, though without much hope, proceed.\nTHE FEELING OF PAST TIME IS A PRESENT FEELING.\nIf asked why we perceive the light of the sun, or the sound of an\nexplosion, we reply, \"Because certain outer forces, ether-waves or\nair-waves, smite upon the brain, awakening therein changes, to which\nthe conscious perceptions, light and sound, respond.\" But we hasten\nto add that neither light nor sound _copy_ or _mirror_ the ether- or\nair-waves; they represent them only symbolically. The _only_ case, says\nHelmholtz, in which such copying occurs, and in which\n\"our perceptions can truly correspond with outer reality, is that of\nthe _tune-succession_ of phenomena. Simultaneity, succession, and\nthe regular return of simultaneity or succession, can obtain as well\nin sensations as in outer events. Events, like our perceptions of\nthem, take place in time, so that the time-relations of the latter\ncan furnish a true copy of those of the former. The sensation of the\nthunder follows the sensation of the lightning just as the sonorous\nconvulsing of the air by the electric discharge reaches the observer's\nplace later than that of the luminiferous ether.\"[551]\nOne experiences an almost instinctive impulse, in pursuing such\nreflections as these, to follow them to a sort of crude speculative\nconclusion, and to think that he has at last got the mystery of\ncognition where, to use a vulgar phrase, 'the wool is short.' What\nmore natural, we say, than that the sequences and durations of things\n_should_ become known? The succession of the outer forces stamps\nitself as a like succession upon the brain. The brain's successive\nchanges are copied exactly by correspondingly successive pulses of\nthe mental stream. The mental stream, feeling itself, must feel the\ntime-relations of its own states. But as these are copies of the\noutward time-relations, so must it know them too. That is to say, these\nlatter time-relations arouse their own cognition; or, in other words,\nthe mere existence of time in those changes out of the mind which\naffect the mind is a sufficient cause why time is perceived by the mind.\nThis philosophy is unfortunately too crude. Even though we _were_\nto conceive the outer successions as forces stamping their image\non the brain, and the brain's successions as forces stamping their\nimage on the mind,[552] still, between the mind's own changes _being_\nsuccessive, and _knowing their own succession_, lies as broad a chasm\nas between the object and subject of any case of cognition in the\nworld. _A succession of feelings, in and of itself, is not a feeling\nof succession. And since, to our successive feelings, a feeling of\ntheir own succession is added, that must be treated as an additional\nfact requiring its own special elucidation,_ which this talk about\nouter time-relations stamping copies of themselves within, leaves all\nuntouched.\nI have shown, at the outset of the article, that what is past, to be\nknown as past, must be known _with_ what is present, and _during_ the\n'present' spot of time. As the clear understanding of this point has\nsome importance, let me, at the risk of repetition, recur to it again.\nVolkmann has expressed the matter admirably, as follows:\n\"One might be tempted to answer the question of the origin of the\ntime-idea by simply pointing to the train of ideas, whose various\nmembers, starting from the first, successively attain to full\nclearness. But against this it must be objected that the successive\nideas are not yet the idea of succession, because succession _in_\nthought is not the thought _of_ succession. If idea A follows idea B,\nconsciousness simply exchanges one for another. That B _comes after_\nA is for our consciousness a non-existent fact; for this _after_ is\ngiven neither in B nor in A; and no third idea has been supposed.\nThe thinking of the sequence of B upon A is another kind of thinking\nfrom that which brought forth A and then brought forth B; and this\nfirst kind of thinking is absent so long as merely the thinking of A\nand the thinking of B are there. In short, when we look at the matter\nsharply, we come to this antithesis, that if _A_ and B are to be\nrepresented _as occurring in succession_ they must be _simultaneously\nrepresented_; if we are to think _of_ them as one after the other, we\nmust _think_ them both at once.\"[553]\nIf we represent the actual time-stream of our thinking by an horizontal\nline, the thought _of_ the stream or of any segment of its length,\npast, present, or to come, might be figured in a perpendicular\nraised upon the horizontal at a certain point. The length of this\nperpendicular stands for a certain object or content, which in this\ncase is the time thought of, and all of which is thought of together at\nthe actual moment of the stream upon which the perpendicular is raised.\nMr. James Ward puts the matter very well in his masterly article\n'Psychology' in the ninth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, page\n64. He says:\n\"We may, if we represent succession as a line, represent simultaneity\nas a second line at right angles to the first; empty time--or\ntime-length without time-breadth, we may say--is a mere abstraction.\nNow, it is with the former line that we have to do in treating of\ntime as it is, and with the latter in treating of our intuition of\ntime, where, just as in a perspective representation of distance, we\nare confined to lines in a plane at right angles to the actual line\nof depth. In a succession of events, say of sense-impressions, A B\nC D E..., the presence of B means the absence of A and C, but the\npresentation of this succession involves the simultaneous presence\nin some mode or other of two or more of the presentations A B C D.\nIn reality, past, present, and future are differences in time, but\nin presentation all that corresponds to these differences is in\nconsciousness simultaneously.\"\nThere is thus a sort of _perspective projection_ of past objects upon\npresent consciousness, similar to that of wide landscapes upon a\ncamera-screen.\nAnd since we saw a while ago that our maximum distinct _intuition_ of\nduration hardly covers more than a dozen seconds (while our maximum\nvague intuition is probably not more than that of a minute or so), we\nmust suppose that _this amount of duration is pictured fairly steadily\nin each passing instant of consciousness_ by virtue of some fairly\nconstant feature in the brain-process to which the consciousness is\ntied. _This feature of the brain-process, whatever it be, must be the\ncause of our perceiving the fact of time at all._[554] The duration\nthus steadily perceived is hardly more than the 'specious present,'\nas it was called a few pages back. Its _content_ is in a constant\nflux, events dawning into its forward end as fast as they fade out\nof its rearward one, and each of them changing its time-coefficient\nfrom 'not yet,' or 'not quite yet,' to 'just gone' or 'gone,' as it\npasses by. Meanwhile, the specious present, the intuited duration,\nstands permanent, like the rainbow on the waterfall, with its own\nquality unchanged by the events that stream through it. Each of these,\nas it slips out, retains the power of being reproduced; and when\nreproduced, is reproduced with the duration and neighbors which it\noriginally had. Please observe, however, that the reproduction of an\nevent, _after_ it has once completely dropped out of the rearward end\nof the specious present, is an entirely different psychic fact from\nits direct perception in the specious present as a thing immediately\npast. A creature might be entirely devoid of _reproductive_ memory,\nand yet have the time-sense; but the latter would be limited, in his\ncase, to the few seconds immediately passing by. Time older than that\nhe would never recall. I assume reproduction in the text, because I am\nspeaking of human beings who notoriously possess it. Thus memory gets\nstrewn with _dated_ things--dated in the sense of being before or after\neach other.[555] The date of a thing is a mere relation of _before_ or\n_after_ the present thing or some past or future thing. Some things\nwe date simply by mentally tossing them into the past or future\n_direction_. So in space we think of England as simply to the eastward,\nof Charleston as lying south. But, again, we may date an event exactly,\nby fitting it between two terms of a past or future series explicitly\nconceived, just as we may accurately think of England or Charleston\nbeing just so many miles away.[556]\nThe things and events thus vaguely or exactly dated become\nthenceforward those signs and symbols of longer time-spaces, of which\nwe previously spoke. According as we think of a multitude of them, or\nof few, so we imagine the time they represent to be long or short.\nBut _the original paragon and prototype of all conceived times is the\nspecious present, the short duration of which we are immediately and\nincessantly sensible._\nTO WHAT CEREBRAL PROCESS IS THE SENSE OF TIME DUE?\n_Now, to what element in the brain-process may this sensibility be\ndue?_ It cannot, as we have seen, be due to the mere duration itself of\nthe process; it must be due to an element present at every moment of\nthe process, and this element must bear the same inscrutable _sort_ of\nrelation to its correlative feeling which all other elements of neural\nactivity bear to their psychic products, be the latter what they may.\nSeveral suggestions have been made as to what the element is in the\ncase of time. Treating of them in a note,[557] I will try to express\nbriefly the only conclusion which seems to emerge from a study of them\nand of the facts--unripe though that conclusion be.\nThe phenomena of 'summation of stimuli' in the nervous system prove\nthat each stimulus leaves some latent activity behind it which only\ngradually passes away. (See above, pp. 82-85.) Psychological proof of\nthe same fact is afforded by those 'after-images' which we perceive\nwhen a sensorial stimulus is gone. We may read off peculiarities in an\nafter-image, left by an object on the eye, which we failed to note in\nthe original. We may 'hark back' and take in the meaning of a sound\nseveral seconds after it has ceased. Delay for a minute, however,\nand the echo itself of the clock or the question is mute; present\nsensations have banished it beyond recall. With the feeling of the\npresent thing there must at all times mingle the fading echo of all\nthose other things which the previous few seconds have supplied. Or,\nto state it in neural terms, _there is at every moment a cumulation of\nbrain-processes overlapping each other, of which the fainter ones are\nthe dying phases of processes which but shortly previous were active\nin a maximal degree. The_ AMOUNT OF THE OVERLAPPING _determines the\nfeeling of the_ DURATION OCCUPIED. WHAT EVENTS _shall appear to occupy\nthe duration depends on just_ WHAT PROCESSES _the overlapping processes\nare._ We know so little of the intimate nature of the brain's activity\nthat even where a sensation monotonously endures, we cannot say that\nthe earlier moments of it do not leave fading processes behind which\ncoexist with those of the present moment. _Duration and events together\nform our intuition of the specious present with its content._[558]\n_Why_ such an intuition should result from such a combination of\nbrain-processes I do not pretend to say. All I aim at is to state the\nmost _elemental_ form of the psycho-physical conjunction.\nI have assumed that the brain-processes are sensational ones. Processes\nof active attention (see Mr. Ward's account in Footnote 556) will leave\nsimilar fading brain-processes behind. If the mental processes are\nconceptual, a complication is introduced of which I will in a moment\nspeak. Meanwhile, still speaking of sensational processes, a remark\nof Wundt's will throw additional light on the account I give. As is\nknown, Wundt and others have proved that every act of perception of\na sensorial stimulus takes an appreciable time. When two different\nstimuli--e.g. a sight and a sound--are given at once or nearly at\nonce, we have difficulty in attending to both, and may wrongly judge\ntheir interval, or even invert their order. Now, as the result of his\nexperiments on such stimuli. Wundt lays down this law:[559] that of the\nthree possible determinations we may make of their order--\n\"namely, simultaneity, continuous transition, and discontinuous\ntransition--only the first and last are realized, _never the second_.\nInvariably, when we fail to perceive the impressions as simultaneous,\nwe notice a shorter or longer empty time between them, _which seems\nto correspond to the sinking of one of the ideas and to the rise of\nthe other_.... For our attention may share itself equally between\nthe two impressions, which will then compose one total percept [and\nbe simultaneously felt]; or it may be so adapted to one event as to\ncause it to be perceived immediately, and then the second event can\nbe perceived only after a certain time of latency, during which the\nattention reaches its effective maximum for it and diminishes for\nthe first event. In this case the events are perceived as _two_, and\nin successive order--that is, as separated by a time-interval in\nwhich attention is not sufficiently accommodated to either to bring a\ndistinct perception about.... While we are hurrying from one to the\nother, everything between them vanishes in the twilight of general\nconsciousness.\"[560]\nOne might call this the _law of discontinuous succession in time, of\npercepts to which we cannot easily attend at once._ Each percept then\nrequires a separate brain-process; and when one brain-process is at its\nmaximum, the other would appear perforce to be in either a waning or\na waxing phase. If our theory of the time-feeling be true, empty time\n_must_ then subjectively appear to separate the two percepts, no matter\nhow close together they may objectively be; for, according to that\ntheory, the feeling of a time-duration is the immediate effect of such\nan overlapping of brain-processes of different phase--wherever and\nfrom whatever cause it may occur.\nTo pass, now, to conceptual processes: Suppose I think of the Creation,\nthen of the Christian era, then of the battle of Waterloo, all within\na few seconds. These matters have their dates far outside the specious\npresent. The processes by which I think them, however, all overlap.\nWhat events, then, does the specious present seem to contain? Simply\nmy successive _acts of thinking_ these long-past things, not the\nlong-past things themselves. As the instantly-present thought may be of\na long-past thing, so the just-past thought may be of another long-past\nthing. When a long-past event is reproduced in memory and conceived\nwith its date, the reproduction and conceiving traverse the specious\npresent. The immediate content of the latter is thus all my _direct\nexperiences_, whether subjective or objective. Some of these meanwhile\nmay be _representative_ of other experiences indefinitely remote.\nThe number of these direct experiences which the specious present\nand immediately-intuited past may embrace measures the extent of\nour 'primary,' as Exner calls it, or, as Richet calls it, of our\n'elementary' memory.[561] The sensation resultant from the overlapping\nis that of the duration which the experiences seem to fill. As is the\nnumber of any larger set of events to that of these experiences, so we\nsuppose is the length of that duration to this duration. But of the\nlonger duration we have no direct 'realizing sense.' The variations\nin our appreciation of the same amount of real time may possibly be\nexplained by alterations in the rate of fading in the images, producing\nchanges in the complication of superposed processes, to which changes\nchanged states of consciousness may correspond. But however _long we\nmay conceive_ a space of time to be, the objective amount of it which\nis _directly perceived_ at any one moment by us can never exceed the\nscope of our 'primary memory' at the moment in question.[562]\nWe have every reason to think that creatures may possibly differ\nenormously in the amounts of duration which they intuitively feel,\nand in the fineness of the events that may fill it. Von B\u00e6r has\nindulged[563] in some interesting computations of the effect of such\ndifferences in changing the aspect of Nature. Suppose we were able,\nwithin the length of a second, to note 10,000 events distinctly,\ninstead of barely 10, as now; if our life were then destined to hold\nthe same number of impressions, it might be 1000 times as short. We\nshould live less than a month, and personally know nothing of the\nchange of seasons. If born in winter, we should believe in summer as\nwe now believe in the heats of the Carboniferous era. The motions of\norganic beings would be so slow to our senses as to be inferred, not\nseen. The sun would stand still in the sky, the moon be almost free\nfrom change, and so on. But now reverse the hypothesis and suppose a\nbeing to get only one 1000th part of the sensations that we get in\na given time, and consequently to live 1000 times as long. Winters\nand summers will be to him like quarters of an hour. Mushrooms and\nthe swifter-growing plants will shoot into being so rapidly as to\nappear instantaneous creations; annual shrubs will rise and fall\nfrom the earth like restlessly boiling-water springs; the motions of\nanimals will be as invisible as are to us the movements of bullets and\ncannon-balls; the sun will scour through the sky like a meteor, leaving\na fiery trail behind him, etc. That such imaginary cases (barring the\nsuperhuman longevity) may be realized somewhere in the animal kingdom,\nit would be rash to deny.\n\"A gnat's wings,\" says Mr Spencer,[564] \"make ten or fifteen thousand\nstrokes a second. Each stroke implies a separate nervous action.\nEach such nervous action or change in a nervous centre is probably\nas appreciable by the gnat as is a quick movement of his arm by a\nman. And if this, or anything like this, is the fact, then the time\noccupied by a given external change, measured by many movements in the\none case, must seem much longer than in the other case, when measured\nby one movement.\"\nIn hashish-intoxication there is a curious increase in the apparent\ntime-perspective. We utter a sentence, and ere the end is reached\nthe beginning seems already to date from indefinitely long ago. We\nenter a short street, and it is as if we should never get to the end\nof it. This alteration might conceivably result from an approach to\nthe condition of Von B\u00e6r's and Spencer's short-lived beings. If our\ndiscrimination of successions became finer-grained, so that we noted\nten stages in a process where previously we only noted one; and if at\nthe same time the processes faded ten times as fast as before; we might\nhave a specious present of the same subjective length as now, giving us\nthe same time-feeling and containing as many distinguishable successive\nevents, but out from the earlier end of it would have dropped nine\ntenths of the real events it now contains. They would have fallen into\nthe general reservoir of merely dated memories, reproducible at will.\nThe beginning of our sentences would have to be expressly recalled;\neach word would appear to pass through consciousness at a tenth of its\nusual speed. The condition would, in short, be exactly analogous to\nthe enlargement of space by a microscope; fewer real things at once in\nthe immediate field of view, but each of them taking up more than its\nnormal room, and making the excluded ones seem unnaturally far away.\nUnder other conditions, processes seem to fade rapidly without the\ncompensating increase in the subdivisibility of successions. Here\nthe apparent length of the specious present contracts. Consciousness\ndwindles to a point, and loses all intuitive sense of the whence and\nwhither of its path. Express acts of memory replace rapid bird's-eye\nviews. In my own case, something like this occurs in extreme fatigue.\nLong illnesses produce it. Occasionally, it appears to accompany\naphasia.[565] It would be vain to seek to imagine the exact\nbrain-change in any of these cases But we must admit the possibility\nthat to some extent the variations of time-estimate between youth and\nage, and excitement and _ennui_, are due to such causes, more immediate\nthan to the one we assigned some time ago.\n_But whether our feeling of the time which immediately-past_[566]\nevents have filled be of something long or of something short, it is\nnot what it is because those events are past,_ but _because they have\nleft behind them processes which are present. To those processes,\nhowever caused, the mind would still respond by feeling a specious\npresent, with one part of it just vanishing or vanished into the past._\nAs the Creator is supposed to have made Adam with a navel--sign of a\nbirth which never occurred--so He might instantaneously make a man\nwith a brain in which were processes just like the 'fading' ones of an\nordinary brain. The first real stimulus after creation would set up\na process additional to these. The processes would overlap; and the\nnew-created man would unquestionably have the feeling, at the very\nprimal instant of his life, of having been in existence already some\nlittle space of time.\nLet me sum up, now, by saying that we are constantly conscious of a\ncertain duration--the specious present--varying in length from a few\nseconds to probably not more than a minute, and that this duration\n(with its content perceived as having one part earlier and the other\npart later) is the original intuition of time. Longer times are\nconceived by adding, shorter ones by dividing, portions of this vaguely\nbounded unit, and are habitually thought by us symbolically. Kant's\nnotion of an _intuition_ of objective time as an infinite necessary\ncontinuum has nothing to support it. The _cause_ of the intuition which\nwe really have cannot be the _duration_ of our brain-processes or our\nmental changes. That duration is rather the _object_ of the intuition\nwhich, being realized at every moment of such duration, must be due\nto a permanently present cause. This cause--probably the simultaneous\npresence of brain-processes of different phase--fluctuates; and hence a\ncertain range of variation in the amount of the intuition, and in its\nsubdivisibility, accrues.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[512] This chapter is reprinted almost verbatim from the Journal of\nSpeculative Philosophy, vol. xx, p. 374.\n[513] James Mill, Analysis, vol. x, p. 319 (J. S. Mill's edition).\n[514] \"What I find, when I look at consciousness at all, is, that\nwhat I cannot divest myself of, or not have in consciousness, if I\nhave consciousness at all, is a sequence of different feelings....\nThe simultaneous perception of both sub-feelings, whether as parts\nof a coexistence or of a sequence, is the total feeling--the minimum\nof consciousness--and this minimum has duration.... Time-duration,\nhowever, is inseparable from the minimum, notwithstanding that, in\nan isolated moment, we could not tell which part of it came first,\nwhich last.... We do not require to know that the sub-feelings come\nin sequence, first one, then the other; nor to know what coming in\nsequence means. But we have, in any artificially isolated minimum of\nconsciousness, the _rudiments_ of the perception of former and latter\nin time, in the sub-feeling that grows fainter, and the sub-feeling\nthat grows stronger, and the change between them....\n\"In the next place, I remark that the rudiments of memory are involved\nin the minimum of consciousness. The first beginnings of it appear in\nthat minimum, just as the first beginnings of perception do. As each\nmember of the change or difference which goes to compose that minimum\nis the rudiment of a single perception, so the priority of one member\nto the other, although both are given to consciousness in one empirical\npresent moment, is the rudiment of memory. The fact that the minimum\nof consciousness is difference or change in feelings, is the ultimate\nexplanation of memory as well as of single perceptions. A former and a\nlatter are included in the minimum of consciousness; and this is what\nis meant by saying that all consciousness is in the form of _time_, or\nthat time is the form of feeling, the form of sensibility. Crudely and\npopularly we divide the course of time into past, present, and future;\nbut, strictly speaking, there is no present; it is composed of past\nand future divided by an indivisible point or instant. That instant,\nor time-point, is the strict _present_. What we call, loosely, the\npresent, is an empirical portion of the course of time, containing at\nleast a minimum of consciousness, in which the instant of change is the\npresent time-point.... If we take this as the present time-point, it is\nclear that the minimum of feeling contains two portions--a sub-feeling\nthat goes and a sub-feeling that comes. One is remembered, the other\nimagined. The limits of both are indefinite at beginning and end of the\nminimum, and ready to melt into other minima, proceeding from other\nstimuli.\n\"Time and consciousness do not come to us ready marked out into minima;\nwe have to do that by reflection, asking ourselves, What is the least\nempirical moment of consciousness? That least empirical moment is what\nwe usually call the present moment; and even this is too minute for\nordinary use; the present moment is often extended practically to a few\nseconds, or even minutes, beyond which we specify what length of time\nwe mean, as the present hour, or day, or year, or century.\n\"But this popular way of thinking imposes itself on great numbers even\nof philosophically-minded people, and they talk about the _present_ as\nif it was a _datum_--as if time came to us marked into present periods\nlike a measuring-tape.\" (S. H. Hodgson: Philosophy of Reflection, vol.\ni, pp. 248-254.)\n\"The representation of time agrees with that of space in that a certain\namount of it must be presented together--included between its initial\nand terminal limit. A continuous ideation, flowing from one point\nto another, would indeed _occupy_ time, but not _represent_ it, for\nit would exchange one element of succession for another instead of\ngrasping the whole succession at once. Both points--the beginning and\nthe end--are equally essential to the conception of time, and must be\npresent with equal clearness together.\" (Herbart: Psychol. als W., \u00a7\n115.)\n\"Assume that ... similar pendulum-strokes follow each other at regular\nintervals in a consciousness otherwise void. When the first one is\nover, an image of it remains in the fancy until the second succeeds.\nThis, then, reproduces the first by virtue of the law of association by\nsimilarity, but at the same time meets with the aforesaid persisting\nimage.... Thus does the simple repetition of the sound provide all\nthe elements of time-perception. The first sound [as it is recalled\nby association] gives the beginning, the second the end, and the\npersistent image in the fancy represents the length of the interval.\nAt the moment of the second impression, the entire time-perception\nexists at once, for then all its elements are presented together, the\nsecond sound and the image in the fancy immediately, and the first\nimpression by reproduction. But, in the same act, we are aware of a\nstate in which only the first sound existed, and of another in which\nonly its image existed in the fancy. Such a consciousness as this _is_\nthat of time.... _In it no succession of ideas takes place._\" (Wundt:\nPhysiol. Psych., 1st ed. pp. 681-2.) Note here the assumption that the\n_persistence_ and the _reproduction_ of an impression are two processes\nwhich may go on simultaneously. Also that Wundt's description is merely\nan _attempt to analyze the 'deliverance'_ of a time-perception, and no\n_explanation of the manner in which it comes about_.\n[515] The Alternative, p. 167.\n[516] Locke, in his dim way, derived the sense of duration from\nreflection on the succession of our ideas (Essay, book ii, chap. xiv,\n\u00a7 3; chap. xv, \u00a7 12). Reid justly remarks that if ten successive\nelements are to make duration, \"then one must make duration, otherwise\nduration must be made up of parts that have no duration, which is\nimpossible.... I conclude, therefore, that there must be duration in\nevery single interval or element of which the whole duration is made\nup. Nothing, indeed, is more certain than that every elementary part of\nextension must have extension. Now, it must be observed that in these\nelements of duration, or single intervals of successive ideas, there\nis no succession of ideas, yet we must conceive them to have duration;\nwhence we may conclude with certainty that _there is a conception\nof duration where there is no succession of ideas in the mind._\"\n(Intellectual Powers, essay iii, chap. v.) \"Qu'on ne cherche point,\"\nsays Royer-Collard in the Fragments added to Jouffroy's Translation of\nReid, \"la dur\u00e9e dans la succession; on ne l'y trouvera jamais; la dur\u00e9e\na pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la succession; la notion de la dur\u00e9e a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la notion de\nla succession. Elle en est donc tout-\u00e0-fait ind\u00e9pendante, dira-t-on?\nOui, elle en est tout-\u00e0-fait ind\u00e9pendante.\"\n[517] Physiol. Psych., ii, 54, 55.\n[518] _Ibid._ ii, 213.\n[519] Philosophische Studien, ii, 362.\n[520] _Counting_ was of course not permitted. It would have given\na symbolic concept and no intuitive or immediate perception of the\ntotality of the series. With counting we may of course compare together\nseries of any length--series whose beginnings have faded from our mind,\nand of whose totality we retain no sensible impression at all. To\ncount a series of clicks is an altogether different thing from merely\nperceiving them as discontinuous. In the latter case we need only be\nconscious of the bits of empty duration between them; in the former we\nmust perform rapid acts of association between them and as many names\nof numbers.\n[521] Estel in Wundt's Philosophische Studien, ii, 50. Mehner, _ibid._\nii, 571. In Dietze's experiments even numbers of strokes were better\ncaught than odd ones, by the ear. The _rapidity of their sequence_\nhad a great influence on the result. At more than 4 seconds apart\nit was impossible to perceive series of them as units in all (cf.\nWundt, Physiol. Psych., ii, 214). They were simply counted as so\nmany individual strokes. Below 0.21 to 0.11 second, according to the\nobserver, judgment again became confused. It was found that the rate of\nsuccession most favorable for grasping long series was when the strokes\nwere sounded at intervals of from 0.3'' to 0.18' apart. Series of 4, 6,\n8, 16 were more easily identified than series of 10, 12, 14, 18. The\nlatter could hardly be clearly grasped at all. Among odd numbers 3, 5,\n7 were the series easiest caught; next, 9, 15; hardest of all, 11 and\n13; and 17 was impossible to apprehend.\n[522] The exact interval of the sparks was 0.00205''. The doubleness\nof their snap was usually replaced by a single-seeming sound when it\nfell to 0.00198'', the sound becoming _louder_ when the sparks seemed\nsimultaneous. The _difference_ between these two intervals is only\n7/100000 of a second; and, as Exner remarks, our ear and brain must be\nwonderfully efficient organs to get distinct feelings from so slight an\nobjective difference as this. See Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, Bd. xi.\n[523] _Ibid._ p. 407. When the sparks fell so close together that their\nirradiation-circles overlapped, they appeared like _one spark moving_\nfrom the position of the first to that of the second; and they might\nthen follow each other as close as 0.015'' without the _direction\nof the movement_ ceasing to be clear. When one spark fell on the\ncentre, the other on the margin, of the retina, the time-interval for\nsuccessive apprehension had to be raised to 0.076''.\n[524] Hall and Jastrow: Studies of Rhythm. Mind, xi, 58.\n[525] Nevertheless, multitudinous impressions may be felt as\ndiscontinuous, though separated by excessively minute intervals of\ntime. Gr\u00fcnhagen says (Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vi, 175) that 10,000 electric\nshocks a second are felt as interrupted, by the tongue (!). Von Wittich\n(_ibid._ ii, 329), that between 1000 and 2000 strokes a second are\nfelt as discrete by the finger. W. Preyer, on the other hand (Die\nGrenzen des Empfindungsverm\u00f6gens, etc., 1868, p. 15), makes contacts\nappear continuous to the finger when 36.8 of them follow in a second.\nSimilarly, Mach (Wiener Sitzgsb., li, 2, 142) gives about 26. Lalanne\n(Comptes Rendus, i/xxxii, p. 1314) found summation of finger contacts\nafter 22 repetitions in a second. Such discrepant figures are of\ndoubtful worth. On the retina 20 to 30 impressions a second at the\nvery utmost can be felt as discrete when they fail on the same spot.\nThe ear, which begins to fuse stimuli together into a musical tone\nwhen they follow at the rate of a little over 30 a second, can still\nfeel 132 of them a second as discontinuous when they take the shape of\n'beats' (Helmholtz, Tonempfindungen, 3d ed. p. 270).\n[526] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, xi, 428. Also in Herrmann's Hdbh. d. Physiol.,\n2 Bd. i, Thl. pp. 260-2.\n[527] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, vii, 639. Tigerstedt (Bihang till Kongl.\nSvenska Vetenskaps Akad, Handl., Bd. 8, H\u00e4fte 2, Stockholm, 1884)\nrevises Exner's figures, and shows that his conclusions are\nexaggerated. According to Tigerstedt, two observers almost always\nrightly appreciated 0.05 or 0.06'' of reaction-time difference. Half\nthe time they did it rightly when the difference sank to 0.03'', though\nfrom 0.03'' and 0.06'' differences were often not noticed at all.\nBuccola found (La Legge del Tempo nei Fenomeni dei Pensiero, Milano,\n1883, p. 371) that, after much practice in making rapid reactions upon\na signal, he estimated directly, in figures, his own reaction-time, in\n10 experiments, with an error of from 0.016'' to 0.018''; in 6, with\none of 0.005'' to 0.069''; in one, with one of 0.002''; and in 3, with\none of 0.003''.\n[528] Mind, xi, 61 (1886).\n[529] Mach, Wiener Sitzungsb., li, 2. 133 (1865); Estel, _loc. cit._\np. 65; Mehner, _loc. cit._ p. 586; Buccola, _op. cit._ p. 378. Fechner\nlabors to prove that his law is only overlaid by other interfering laws\nin the figures recorded by these experimenters; but his case seems\nto me to be one of desperate infatuation with a hobby. (See Wundt's\nPhilosphische Studien iii, 1.)\n[530] Curious discrepancies exist between the German and the American\nobservers with respect to the _direction_ of the error below and above\nthe point of indifference--differences perhaps due the _fatigue_\ninvolved in the American method. The Germans lengthened intervals below\nit and shortened those above. With seven Americans experimented on by\nStevens this was exactly reversed. The German method was to passively\nlisten to the intervals, then judge; the American was to reproduce\nthem actively by movements of the hand. In Mehner's experiments there\nwas found a second indifference point at about 5 seconds, beyond which\ntimes were judged again too long. Glass, whose work on the subject is\nthe latest (Philos. Studien, iv, 423) found (when corrections were\nallowed for) that all times except 0.8 sec. were estimated too short.\nHe found a series of points of greatest relative accuracy, viz. at\n1.5, 2.5, 3.75, 5, 6.25, etc., seconds respectively, and thought that\nhis observations roughly corroborated Weber's law. As 'maximum' and\n'minimum' are printed interchangeably in Glass's article it is hard to\nfollow.\n[531] With Vierordt and his pupils the indifference point lay as\nhigh as from 1.5 sec to 4.9 sec, according to the observer (cf. Der\nZeitsinn, 1868, p. 112). In most of these experiments the time heard\nwas actively reproduced, after a short pause, by movements of the hand,\nwhich were recorded. Wundt gives good reasons (Physiol. Psych., ii,\n289, 290) for rejecting Vierordt's figures as erroneous. Vierordt's\nbook, it should be said, is full of important matter, nevertheless.\n[532] Physiol. Psych., ii, 286, 290.\n[533] Philosophische Studien, i, 86.\n[534] Mind, xi, 400.\n[535] _Loc cit._ p. 144.\n[536] _Op. cit._ p. 376. Mach's and Buccola's figures, it will be\nobserved, are about _one half_ of the rest--sub-multiples, therefore.\nIt ought to be observed, however, that Buccola's figure has little\nvalue, his observations not being well fitted to show this particular\npoint.\n[537] Estel's figures led him to think that _all_ the multiples\nenjoyed this privilege; with Mehner, on the other hand, only the _odd_\nmultiples showed diminution of the average error; thus, 0.71, 2.15,\n3.55, 5, 6.4, 7.8, 9.3, and 10.65 second were respectively registered\nwith the least error.

Hall and Jastrow: Mind, xi, 62.\n[540] Mehner: _loc. cit._ p. 553.\n[541] The number of distinguishable _differences_ of speed between\nthese limits is, as he takes care to remark, very much larger that 7.\n(Der Zeitsinn, p. 137).\n[542] P. 19, \u00a7 18, p. 112.\n[543] I leave the text just as it was printed in the Journal of\nSpeculative Philosophy (for 'Oct. 1886') in 1887. Since then\nM\u00fcnsterberg in his masterly Beitr\u00e4ge zur experimentellen Psychologie\n(Heft 2, 1889) seems to have made it clear what the sensible changes\nare by which we measure the lapse of time. When the time which\nseparates two sensible impressions is less than one third of a second,\nhe thinks it is almost entirely the amount to which the memory-image\nof the first impression has faded when the second one overtakes\nit, which makes us feel how wide they are apart (p. 29). When the\ntime is longer than this, we rely, he thinks, exclusively upon the\nfeelings of muscular tension and relaxation, which we are constantly\nreceiving although we give to them so little of our direct attention.\nThese feelings are primarily in the muscles by which we adopt our\nsense-organs in attending to the signals used, some of the muscles\nbeing in the eye and ear themselves, some of them in the head, neck,\netc. We here judge two time-intervals to be equal when between the\nbeginning and end of each we feel exactly similar relaxations and\nsubsequent expectant tensions of these muscles to have occurred. In\nreproducing intervals ourselves we try to make our feelings of this\nsort just what they were when we passively heard the interval. These\nfeelings by themselves, however, can only be used when the intervals\nare very short, for the tension anticipatory of the terminal stimulus\nnaturally reaches its maximum very soon. With longer intervals we _take\nthe feeling of our inspirations and expirations into account_. With\nour expirations all the other muscular tensions in our body undergo a\nrhythmical decrease; with our inspirations the reverse takes place.\nWhen, therefore, we note a time-interval of several seconds with\nintent to reproduce it, what we seek is to make the earlier and later\ninterval agree in the number and amount of these respiratory changes\ncombined with sense-organ adjustments with which they are filled.\nM\u00fcnsterberg has studied carefully in his own ease the variations of\nthe respiratory factor. They are many; but he sums up his experience\nby saying that whether he measured by inspirations that were divided\nby momentary pauses into six parts, or by inspirations that were\ncontinuous; whether with sensory tension during inspiration and\nrelaxation during expiration, or by tension during both inspiration\nand expiration, separated by a sudden interpolated relaxation; whether\nwith special notice taken of the cephalic tensions, or of those in\nthe trunk and shoulders, in all cases alike and without exception he\ninvoluntarily endeavored, whenever he compared two times or tried to\nmake one the same as the other, to get exactly the same respiratory\nconditions and conditions of tension, _all_ the subjective conditions,\nin short, _exactly_ the same during the second interval as they were\nduring the first. M\u00fcnsterberg corroborated his subjective observations\nby experiments. The observer of the time had to reproduce as exactly\nas possible an interval between two sharp sounds given him by an\nassistant. The only condition imposed upon him was that he should not\nmodify his breathing for the purposes of measurement. It was then\nfound that when the assistant broke in at random with his signals,\nthe judgment of the observer was vastly less accurate than when the\nassistant carefully watched the observer's breathing and made both\nthe beginning of the time given him and that of the time which he was\nto give coincide with identical phases thereof.--Finally, M\u00fcnsterberg\nwith great plausibility tries to explain the discrepancies between the\nresults of Vierordt, Estel, Mehner, Glass, etc., as due to the fact\nthat they _did not all use the same measure_. Some breathe a little\nfaster, some a little slower. Some break their inspirations into\ntwo parts, some do not, etc. The coincidence of the objective times\nmeasured with definite natural phases of breathing would very easily\ngive periodical maxima of facility in measuring accurately.\n[544] \"Any one wishing yet further examples of this mental substitution\nwill find one on observing how habitually he thinks of the spaces\non the clock-face instead of the periods they stand for; how, on\ndiscovering it to be half an hour later than be supposed, he does not\nrepresent the half hour in its duration, but scarcely passes beyond the\nsign of it marked by the finger.\" (H. Spencer: Psychology, \u00a7 336.)\n[545] The only objections to this which I can think of are: (1)\nThe accuracy with which some men judge of the hour of day or night\nwithout looking at the clock; (2) the faculty some have of waking at\na preappointed hour; (3) the accuracy of time-perception reported to\nexist in certain trance-subjects. It might seem that in these persons\nsome sort of a sub-conscious record was kept of the lapse of time\n_per se_. But this cannot be admitted until it is proved that there\nare no physiological processes, the feeling of whose course may serve\nas a _sign_ of how much time has sped, and so lead us to infer the\nhour. That there are such processes it is hardly possible to doubt. An\ningenious friend of mine was long puzzled to know why each day of the\nweek had such a characteristic physiognomy to him. That of Sunday was\nsoon noticed to be due to the cessation of the city's rumbling, and\nthe sound of people's feet shuffling on the sidewalk; of Monday, to\ncome from the clothes drying in the yard and casting a white reflection\non the ceiling; of Tuesday, to a cause which I forget; and I think my\nfriend did not get beyond Wednesday. Probably each hour in the day has\nfor most of us some outer or inner sign associated with it as closely\nas these signs with the days of the week. It must be admitted, after\nall, however, that the great improvement of the time-perception during\nsleep and trance is a mystery not as yet cleared up. All my life I have\nbeen struck by the accuracy with which I will wake at the same exact\nminute night after night and morning after morning, if only the habit\nfortuitously begins. The organic registration in me is independent of\nsleep. After lying in bed a long time awake I suddenly rise without\nknowing the time, and for days and weeks together will do so at an\nidentical minute by the clock, as if some inward physiological process\ncaused the act by punctually running down.-\u2014Idiots are said sometimes\nto possess the time-measuring faculty in a marked degree. I have an\ninteresting manuscript account of an idiot girl which says: \"She was\npunctual almost to a minute in her demand for food and other regular\nattentions. Her dinner was generally furnished her at 12.30 p. m., and\nat that hour she would begin to scream if it were not forthcoming. If\non Fast-day or Thanksgiving it were delayed, in accordance with the\nNew England custom, she screamed from her usual dinner-hour until the\nfood was carried to her. On the next day, however, she again made known\nher wants promptly at 12.30. Any slight attention shown her on one\nday was demanded on the next at the corresponding hour. If an orange\nwere given her at 4 p. m. on Wednesday, at the same hour on Thursday\nshe made known her expectation, and if the fruit were not given her\nshe continued to call for it at intervals for two or three hours. At\nfour on Friday the process would be repeated but would last less long;\nand so on for two or three days.

To change the example, let, in a piece of polyphonic\nmusic--a figure, for instance, in which a tangle of melodies are\nunder way--suddenly a single voice be heard, which sustains a long\nnote, while all else is hushed....

But the\nodiousness of this experience is not named _ennui_ or _Langweile_, like\nthe odiousness of time that seems long from its emptiness. The more\npositive odiousness of the pain, rather, is what tinges our memory of\nthe night. What we feel, as Prof. Lazarus says (_op. cit._ p. 202), is\nthe long time of the suffering, not the suffering of the long time _per\nse_.\n[550] On these variations of time-estimate, cf. Romanes, Consciousness\nof Time, in Mind, vol. iii, p. 297; J. Sully, Illusions, pp. 245-261,\n302-305; W. Wundt. Physiol. Psych., ii, 287, 288; besides the essays\nquoted from Lazarus and Janet. In German, the successors of Herbart\nhave treated of this subject: compare Volkmann's Lehrbuch d. Psych.,\n\u00a7 89, and for references to other authors his note 3 to this section.\nLindner (Lbh. d. empir. Psych.), as a parallel effect, instances\nAlexander the Great's life (thirty-three years), which seems to us as\nif it must be long, because it was so eventful. Similarly the English\nCommonwealth, etc.\n[551] Physiol. Optik, p. 445.\n[552] Succession, time _per se_, is no force. Our talk about its\ndevouring tooth, etc., is all elliptical. Its contents are what devour.\nThe law of inertia is incompatible with time's being assumed as an\nefficient cause of anything.\n[553] Lehrbuch d. Psych., \u00a7 87. Compare also H. Lotze, Metaphysik, \u00a7\n154.\n[554] The cause of the perceiving, not the object perceived!\n[555] \"'No more' and 'not yet' are the proper time-feelings, and we\nare aware of time in no other way than through these feelings,\" says\nVolkmann (Psychol., \u00a7 87). This, which is not strictly true of our\nfeeling of _time per se_, as an elementary bit of duration, is true of\nour feeling of _date_ in its events.\n[556] We construct the miles just as we construct the years. Travelling\nin the cars makes a succession of different fields of view pass before\nour eyes. When those that have passed from present sight revive in\nmemory, they maintain their mutual order because their contents\noverlap. We think them as having been before or behind each other;\nand, from the multitude of the views we can recall behind the one now\npresented, we compute the total space we have passed through.\nIt is often said that the perception of time develops later than\nthat of space, because children have so vague an idea of all dates\nbefore yesterday and after to-morrow. But no vaguer than they have\nof extensions that exceed as greatly their unit of space-intuition.\nRecently I heard my child of four tell a visitor that he had been 'as\nmuch as one week' in the country. As he had been there three months,\nthe visitor expressed surprise; whereupon the child corrected himself\nby saying he had been there 'twelve years.' But the child made exactly\nthe same kind of mistake when he asked if Boston was not one hundred\nmiles from Cambridge, the distance being three miles.\n[557] Most of these explanations simply give the _signs_ which,\nadhering to impressions, lead us to date them within a duration, or,\nin other words, to assign to them their order. Why it should be a\n_time_-order, however, is not explained. Herbart's would-be explanation\nis a simple description of time-perception. He says it comes when,\nwith the last member of a series present to our consciousness, we also\nthink of the first; and then the whole series revives in our thought\nat once, but with strength diminishing in the backward direction\n(Psychol. als Wiss., \u00a7 115; Lehrb. zur Psychol., \u00a7\u00a7 171, 172, 175).\nSimilarly Drobisch, who adds that the series must appear as one already\n_elapsed_ (_durchlaufene_), a word which shows even more clearly\nthe question-begging nature of this sort of account (Empirische\nPsychol., \u00a7 59). Th. Waitz is guilty of similar question-begging\nwhen he explains our time-consciousness to be engendered by a\nset of unsuccessful attempts to make our percepts agree with our\n_expectations_ (Lehrb. d. Psychol., \u00a7 52). Volkmann's mythological\naccount of past representations striving to drive present ones out\nof the seat of consciousness, being driven _back_ by them, etc.,\nsuffers from the same fallacy (Psychol., \u00a7 87). But all such accounts\nagree in implying one fact\u2014-viz., that the brain-processes of various\nevents must be active simultaneously, and in varying strength, for\na time-perception to be possible. Later authors have made this idea\nmore precise. Thus, Lipps: \"Sensations arise, occupy consciousness,\nfade into images, and vanish. According as two of them, _a_ and _b_,\ngo through this process simultaneously, or as one precedes or follows\nthe other, the _phases of their fading_ will agree or differ; and the\ndifference will be proportional to the time-difference between their\nseveral moments of beginning. Thus there are differences of _quality_\nin the images, which the mind may _translate_ into corresponding\ndifferences of their temporal order. There is no other possible middle\nterm between the objective time-relations and those in the mind than\nthese differences of phase.\" (Grundtatsachen des Seelenlebens, p. 588.)\nLipps accordingly calls them 'temporal signs,' and hastens explicitly\nto add that the soul's translation of their order of strength into a\ntime-order is entirely inexplicable (p. 591). M. Guyau's account (Revue\nPhilosophique, xix, 353) hardly differs from that of his predecessors,\nexcept in picturesqueness of style. Every change leaves a series of\n_train\u00e9es lumineuses_ in the mind like the passage of shooting stars.\nEach image is in a more fading phase, according as its original was\nmore remote. This group of images gives duration, the mere time-form,\nthe 'bed' of time. The distinction of past, present, and future within\nthe bed comes from our active nature. The future (as with Waitz) is\nwhat I want, but have not yet got, and must wait for. All this is\ndoubtless true, but is no _explanation_.\nMr. Ward gives, in his Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article (Psychology,\np. 65, col. 1), a still more refined attempt to specify the 'temporal\nsign.' The problem being, among a number of other things thought as\nsuccessive, but simultaneously thought, to determine which is first and\nwhich last, he says: \"After each distinct representation, _a b c d,_\nthere may intervene the representation of that _movement of attention_\nof which we are aware in passing from one object to another. In our\npresent reminiscence we have, it must be allowed, little direct proof\nof this intervention; though there is, I think, indirect evidence of\nit in the tendency of the flow of ideas to follow the order in which\nthe presentations were at first attended to. With the movement itself\nwhen the direction of attention changes, we are familiar enough, though\nthe residua of such movements are not ordinarily conspicuous. These\nresidua, then, are our temporal signs.... But temporal signs alone\nwill not furnish all the pictorial exactness of the time-perspective.\nThese give us only a fixed series; but the law of obliviscence, by\ninsuring a progressive variation in intensity as we pass from one\nmember of the series to the other, yields the effect which we call\ntime-distance. By themselves such variations in intensity would leave\nus liable to confound more vivid representations in the distance with\nfainter ones nearer the present, but from this mistake the temporal\nsigns save us; where the memory-continuum is imperfect such mistakes\ncontinually occur. On the other hand, where these variations are\nslight and imperceptible, though the memory-continuum preserves the\norder of events intact, we have still no such distinct appreciation of\ncomparative distance in time as we have nearer to the present, where\nthese perceptive effects are considerable.... Locke speaks of our ideas\nsucceeding each other 'at certain distances not much unlike the images\nin the inside of a lantern turned round by the heat of a candle,' and\n'guesses' that 'this appearance of theirs in train varies not very\nmuch in a waking man.' _Now what is this 'distance' that separates a\nfrom b, b from c, and so on;_ and what means have we of knowing that\nit is tolerably constant in waking life? _It is, probably, that, the\nresiduum of which I have called a temporal sign; or, in other words,\nit is the movement of attention from a to b._\" Nevertheless, Mr. Ward\ndoes not call our feeling of this movement of attention the _original_\nof our feeling of time, or its brain-process the brain-process which\ndirectly causes us to perceive time. He says, a moment later, that\n\"though the fixation of attention does of course really occupy time,\nit is probably not in the first instance perceived as time--i.e. as\ncontinuous 'protensity,' to use a term of Hamilton's--but as intensity.\nThus, if this supposition be true, there is an element in our concrete\ntime perceptions which has no place in our abstract conception of\nTime. In Time physically conceived there is no trace of intensity;\nin time psychically experienced, duration is primarily an intensive\nmagnitude, and so far literally a perception.\" Its 'original' is, then,\nif I understand Mr Ward, something like a _feeling_ which accompanies,\nas pleasure and pain may accompany, the movements of attention. Its\nbrain-process must, it would seem, be assimilated in general type to\nthe brain-processes of pleasure and pain. Such would seem more or\nless consciously to be Mr. Ward's own view, for he says: \"Everybody\nknows what it is to be distracted by a rapid succession of varied\nimpressions, and equally what it is to be wearied by the slow and\nmonotonous recurrence of the same impressions. Now these 'feelings'\nof distraction and tedium owe their characteristic qualities to\nmovements of attention. In the first, attention is kept incessantly\non the move; before it is accommodated to _a_, it is disturbed by\nthe suddenness, intensity, and novelty of _b_; in the second, it is\nkept all but stationary by the repeated presentation of the same\nimpression. Such excess and defect of surprises make one realize a fact\nwhich in ordinary life is so obscure as to escape notice. But recent\nexperiments have set this fact in a more striking light, and made clear\nwhat Locke had dimly before his mind in talking of a certain distance\nbetween the presentations of a waking man. In estimating very short\nperiods of time of a second or less, indicated, say, by the beats of\na metronome, it is found that there is a certain period for which the\nmean of a number of estimates is correct, while shorter periods are on\nthe whole over-, and longer periods under-estimated. I take this to be\nevidence of the time occupied in accommodating or fixing attention.\"\nAlluding to the fact that a series of experiences, _a b c d e,_ may\nseem short in retrospect, which seemed everlasting in passing, he\nsays: \"What tells in retrospect is the series _a b c d e_, etc.; what\ntells in the present is the intervening _t_{1} t_{2} t_{3},_ etc., or\nrather the original accommodation of which these temporal signs are\nthe residuum.\" And he concludes thus: \"We seem to have proof that our\nperception of duration rests ultimately upon quasi-motor objects of\nvarying intensity, the duration of which we do not directly experience\nas duration at all.\"\nWundt also thinks that the interval of about three-fourths of a second,\nwhich is estimated with the minimum of error, points to a connection\nbetween the time-feeling and the succession of distinctly 'apperceived'\nobjects before the mind. The 'association-time' is also equal to about\nthree fourths of a second. This association-time he regards as a sort\nof internal standard of duration to which we involuntarily assimilate\nall intervals which we try to reproduce, bringing shorter ones up to\nit and longer ones down. [In the Stevens result we should have to say\n_contrast_ instead of assimilate, for the longer intervals there seem\nlonger, and the shorter ones shorter still.] \"Singularly enough,\" he\nadds (Physiol. Psych., ii, 286), \"this time is about that in which in\nrapid walking, according to the Webers, our legs perform their swing.\nIt seems thus not unlikely that both psychical constants, that of the\naverage speed of reproduction and that of the surest estimation of\ntime, have formed themselves under the influence of those most habitual\nmovements of the body which we also use when we try to subdivide\nrhythmically longer tracts of time.\"\nFinally, Prof. Mach makes a suggestion more specific still. After\nsaying very rightly that we have a real _sensation_ of time--how\notherwise should we identify two entirely different airs as being\nplayed in the same 'time'? how distinguish in memory the first stroke\nof the clock from the second, unless to each there clove its special\ntime-sensation, which revived with it?--he says \"it is probable that\nthis feeling is connected with that organic _consumption_ which is\nnecessarily linked with the production of consciousness, and that the\ntime which we feel is probably due to the [mechanical?] _work of_\n[the process of?] _attention_. When attention is strained, time seems\nlong; during easy occupation, short, etc.... The fatigue of the organ\nof consciousness, as long as we wake, continually increases, and the\nwork of attention augments as continually. Those impressions which\nare conjoined with a _greater amount_ of work of attention appear to\nus as the _later_.\" The apparent relative displacement of certain\nsimultaneous events and certain anachronisms of dreams are held by Mach\nto be easily explicable as effects of a splitting of the attention\nbetween two objects, one of which consumes most of it (Beitr\u00e4ge zur\nAnalyse der Empfindungen, p. 103 foll.). Mach's theory seems worthy of\nbeing better worked out. It is hard to say now whether he, Ward, and\nWundt mean at bottom the same thing or not. The theory advanced in my\nown text, it will be remarked, does not pretend to be an _explanation_,\nbut only an elementary statement of the 'law' which makes us aware of\ntime. The Herbartian mythology purports to _explain_.\n[558] It would be rash to say definitely just how many seconds\nlong this specious present must needs be, for processes fade\n'asymptotically,' and the distinctly intuited present merges into a\npenumbra of mere dim _recency_ before it turns into the past which\nis simply reproduced and conceived. Many a thing which we do not\ndistinctly date by intercalating it in a place between two other things\nwill, nevertheless, come to us with this feeling of belonging to a\n_near_ past. This sense of recency is a feeling _sui generis_, and\nmay affect things that happened hours ago. It would seem to show that\ntheir brain-processes are still in a state modified by the foregoing\nexcitement, still in a 'fading' phase, in spite of the long interval.\n[559] Physiol. Psych, ii, 263.\n[560] I leave my text as it was printed before M\u00fcnsterberg's essay\nappeared (see Footnote 542, above). He denies that we measure any but\nminimal durations by the amount of fading in the ideational processes,\nand talks almost exclusively of our feelings of muscular tension in\nhis account, whereas I have made no mention of such things in mine. I\ncannot, however, see that there is any conflict between what he and\nI suggest. I am mainly concerned with the consciousness of duration\nregarded as a specific sort of object, he is concerned with this\nobject's measurement exclusively. Feelings of tension might be the\nmeans of the measurement, whilst overlapping processes of any and every\nkind gave the object to be measured. The accommodative and respiratory\nmovements from which the feelings of tension come form regularly\nrecurring sensations divided by their 'phases' into intervals as\ndefinite as those by which a yardstick is divided by the marks upon its\nlength.\nLet _a^1, a^2, a^3, a^4,_ be homologous phases in four successive\nmovements of this kind. If four outer stimuli 1, 2, 3, 4, coincide\neach with one of these successive phases, then their 'distances apart'\nare felt as _equal_, otherwise not. But there is no reason whatever\nto suppose that the mere overlapping of the brain-process of 2 by the\nfading process of 1, or that of 3 by that of 2, etc., does not give\nthe _characteristic quality of content_ which we call 'distance apart'\nin this experience, and which by aid of the muscular feelings gets\njudged to be equal. Doubtless the muscular feelings can give us the\nobject 'time' as well as its measure, because their earlier phases\nleave fading sensations which constantly overlap the vivid sensation of\nthe present phase. But it would be contrary to analogy to suppose that\nthey should be the only experiences which give this object. I do not\nunderstand Herr M\u00fcnsterberg to claim this for them. He takes our sense\nof time for granted, and only discusses its measurement.\n[561] Exner in Hermann's Hdbch. d. Physiol., Bd. ii, Thl. ii, p. 281.\nRichet in Revue Philosophique, xxi, 568 (juin, 1886). See the next\nchapter, pp. 642-646.\n[562] I have spoken of _fading_ brain-processes alone, but only for\nsimplicity's sake. _Dawning_ processes probably play as important a\npart in giving the feeling of duration to the specious present.\n[563] Reden (St. Petersburg, 1864), vol. i, pp. 255-268.\n[564] Psychology, \u00a7 91.\n[565] \"The patient cannot retain the image of an object more than\na moment. His memory is as short for sounds, letters, figures, and\nprinted words. If we cover a written or printed word with a sheet of\npaper in which a little window has been cut, so that only the first\nletter is visible through the window, he pronounces this letter. If,\nthen, the sheet is moved so as to cover the first letter and make the\nsecond one visible, he pronounces the second, but forgets the first,\nand cannot pronounce the first and second together.\" And so forth to\nthe end. \"If he closes his eyes and draws his finger exploringly over a\nwell-known object like a knife or key, he cannot combine the separate\nimpressions and recognize the object. But if it is put into his hand\nso that he can simultaneously touch it with several fingers, he names\nit without difficulty. This patient has thus lost the capacity for\ngrouping successive ... impressions ... into a whole and perceiving\nthem as a whole.\" (Grashey, in Archiv f\u00fcr Psychiatrie, Bd. xvi, pp.\n672-673.) It is hard to believe that in such a patient the time\nintuited was not clipped off like the impressions it held, though\nperhaps not so much of it.\nI have myself often noted a curious exaggeration of time-perspective\nat the moment of a falling asleep. A person will be moving or doing\nsomething in the room, and a certain stage of his act (whatever it may\nbe) will be my last waking perception. Then a subsequent stage will\nwake me to a new perception. The two stages of the act will not be more\nthan a few seconds apart; and yet it always seems to me as if, between\nthe earlier and the later one, a long interval has passed away. I\nconjecturally account for the phenomenon thus, calling the two stages\nof the act _a_ and _b_ respectively: Were I awake, _a_ would leave a\nfading process in my sensorium which would overlap the process of _b_\nwhen the latter came, and both would then appear in the same specious\npresent, _a_ belonging to its earlier end. But the sudden advent of the\nbrain-change called sleep extinguishes _a_'s fading process abruptly.\nWhen _b_ then comes and wakes me, _a_ comes back, it is true, but not\nas belonging to the specious present. It has to be specially _revoked_\nin memory. This mode of revocation usually characterizes long-past\nthings--whence the illusion.\n[566] Again I omit the future, merely for simplicity's sake.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nMEMORY.\nIn the last chapter what concerned us was the direct _intuition_ of\ntime. We found it limited to intervals of considerably less than a\nminute. Beyond its borders extends the immense region of _conceived_\ntime, past and future, into one direction or another of which we\nmentally project all the events which we think of as real, and form\na systematic order of them by giving to each a date. The relation of\nconceived to intuited time is just like that of the fictitious space\npictured on the flat back-scene of a theatre to the actual space of the\nstage. The objects painted on the former (trees, columns, houses in a\nreceding street, etc.) carry back the series of similar objects solidly\nplaced upon the latter, and we think we see things in a continuous\nperspective, when we really see thus only a few of them and imagine\nthat we see the rest. The chapter which lies before us deals with the\nway in which we paint the remote past, as it were, upon a canvas in our\nmemory, and yet often imagine that we have direct vision of its depths.\nThe stream of thought flows on; but most of its segments fall into the\nbottomless abyss of oblivion. Of some, no memory survives the instant\nof their passage. Of others, it is confined to a few moments, hours,\nor days. Others, again, leave vestiges which are indestructible, and\nby means of which they may be recalled as long as life endures. Can we\nexplain these differences?\nPRIMARY MEMORY.\nThe first point to be noticed is that _for a state of mind to survive\nin memory it must have endured, for a certain length of time_. In\nother words, it must be what I call a substantive state. Prepositional\nand conjunctival states of mind are not remembered as independent\nfacts--we cannot recall just how we felt when we said 'how' or\n'notwithstanding.' Our consciousness of these transitive states is\nshut up to their own moment--hence one difficulty in introspective\npsychologizing.\nAny state of mind which is shut up to its own moment and fails to\nbecome an object for succeeding states of mind, is as if it belonged to\nanother stream of thought. Or rather, it belongs only physically, not\nintellectually, to its own stream, forming a bridge from one segment of\nit to another, but not being appropriated inwardly by former segments\nor appearing as part of the empirical self, in the manner explained in\nChapter X. All the intellectual value for us of a state of mind depends\non our after-memory of it. Only then is it combined in a system and\nknowingly made to contribute to a result. Only then does it _count_ for\nus. So that _the_ EFFECTIVE _consciousness we have of our states is the\nafter-consciousness_; and the more of this there is, the more influence\ndoes the original state have, and the more permanent a factor is it\nof our world. An indelibly-imprinted pain may color a life; but, as\nProfessor Richet says:\n\"To suffer for only a hundredth of a second is not to suffer at all;\nand for my part I would readily agree to undergo a pain, however acute\nand intense it might be, provided it should last only a hundredth of a\nsecond, and leave after it neither reverberation nor recall.\"[567]\nNot that a momentary state of consciousness need be practically\nresultless. Far from it: such a state, though absolutely unremembered,\nmight at its own moment determine the transition of our thinking in a\nvital way, and decide our action irrevocably.[568] But the _idea_ of it\ncould not _afterwards_ determine transition and action, its content\ncould not be conceived as one of the mind's permanent meanings: that is\nall I mean by saying that its intellectual value lies in after-memory.\nAs a rule sensations outlast for some little time the objective\nstimulus which occasioned them. This phenomenon is the ground of\nthose 'after-images' which are familiar in the physiology of the\nsense-organs. If we open our eyes instantaneously upon a scene, and\nthen shroud them in complete darkness, it will be as if we saw the\nscene in ghostly light through the dark screen. We can read off details\nin it which were unnoticed whilst the eyes were open.[569]\nIn every sphere of sense, an intermittent stimulus, often enough\nrepeated, produces a continuous sensation. This is because the\nafter-image of the impression just gone by blends with the new\nimpression coming in. The effects of stimuli may thus be superposed\nupon each other many stages deep, the total result in consciousness\nbeing an increase in the feeling's intensity, and in all probability,\nas we saw in the last chapter, an elementary sense of the lapse of time\n(see p. 635).\nExner writes:\n\"Impressions to which we are inattentive leave so brief an image\nin the memory that it is usually overlooked. When deeply absorbed,\nwe do not hear the clock strike. But our attention may awake after\nthe striking has ceased, and we may then count off the strokes.\nSuch examples are often found in daily life. We can also prove the\nexistence of this _primary memory-image_, as it may be called, in\nanother person, even when his attention is completely absorbed\nelsewhere. Ask someone, e.g., to count the lines of a printed page\nas fast as he can, and whilst this is going on walk a few steps\nabout the room. Then, when the person has done counting, ask him\nwhere you stood. He will always reply quite definitely that you have\nwalked. Analogous experiments may be made with vision. This primary\nmemory-image is, whether attention have been turned to the impression\nor not, an extremely lively one, but is subjectively quite distinct\nfrom every sort of after-image or hallucination.... It vanishes, if\nnot caught by attention, in the course of a few seconds. Even when the\noriginal impression is attended to, the liveliness of its image in\nmemory fades fast.\"[570]\nThe physical condition in the nerve-tissue of this primary memory is\ncalled by Richet 'elementary memory.'[571] I much prefer to reserve\nthe word memory for the conscious phenomenon. What happens in the\nnerve-tissue is but an example of that plasticity or of semi-inertness,\nyielding to change, but not yielding instantly or wholly, and never\nquite recovering the original form, which, in Chapter V, we saw to\nbe the groundwork of habit. Elementary _habit_ would be the better\nname for what Professor Richet means. Well, the first manifestation\nof elementary habit is the slow dying away of an impressed movement\non the neural matter, and its first effect in consciousness is this\nso-called elementary memory. But what elementary memory makes us aware\nof is the _just_ past. The objects we feel in this directly intuited\npast differ from properly recollected objects. An object which is\nrecollected, in the proper sense of that term, is one which has been\nabsent from consciousness altogether, and now revives anew. It is\nbrought back, recalled, fished up, so to speak, from a reservoir in\nwhich, with countless other objects, it lay buried and lost from view.\nBut an object of primary memory is not thus brought back; it never\nwas lost; its date was never cut off in consciousness from that of\nthe immediately present moment. In fact it comes to us as belonging\nto the rearward portion of the present space of time, and not to the\ngenuine past. In the last chapter we saw that the portion of time which\nwe directly intuit has a breadth of several seconds, a rearward and a\nforward end, and may be called the specious present. All stimuli whose\nfirst nerve-vibrations have not yet ceased seem to be conditions of our\ngetting this feeling of the specious present. They give rise to objects\nwhich appear to the mind as events just past.[572]\nWhen we have been exposed to an unusual stimulus for many minutes or\nhours, a nervous process is set up which results in the haunting of\nconsciousness by the impression for a long time afterwards. The tactile\nand muscular feelings of a day of skating or riding, after long disuse\nof the exercise, will come back to us all through the night. Images\nof the field of view of the microscope will annoy the observer for\nhours after an unusually long sitting at the instrument. A thread tied\naround the finger, an unusual constriction in the clothing, will feel\nas if still there, long after they have been removed. These revivals\n(called phenomena of _Sinnesged\u00e4chtniss_ by the Germans) have something\nperiodical in their nature.[573] They show that profound rearrangements\nand slow settlings into a new equilibrium are going on in the neural\nsubstance, and they form the transition to that more peculiar and\nproper phenomenon of memory, of which the rest of this chapter must\ntreat. The first condition which makes a thing susceptible of recall\nafter it has been forgotten is that the original impression of it\nshould have been prolonged enough to give rise to a _recurrent_ image\nof it, as distinguished from one of those primary after-images which\nvery fleeting impressions may leave behind, and which contain in\nthemselves no guarantee that they will ever come back after having\nonce faded away.[574] A certain length of stimulation seems demanded\nby the inertia of the nerve-substance. Exposed to a shorter influence,\nits modification fails to 'set,' and it retains no effective tendency\nto fall again into the same form of vibration at which the original\nfeeling was due. This, as I said at the outset, may be the reason why\nonly 'substantive' and not 'transitive' states of mind are as a rule\nrecollected, at least as independent things. The transitive states pass\nby too quickly.\nANALYSIS OF THE PHENOMENON OF MEMORY.\nMemory proper, or secondary memory as it might be styled, is the\nknowledge of a former state of mind after it has already once dropped\nfrom consciousness; or rather _it is the knowledge of an event,\nor fact,_ of which meantime we have not been thinking, _with the\nadditional consciousness that we have thought or experienced it\nbefore._\nThe first element which such a knowledge involves would seem to be the\nrevival in the mind of an image or copy of the original event.[575] And\nit is an assumption made by many writers[576] that the revival of an\nimage is all that is needed to constitute the memory of the original\noccurrence. But such a revival is obviously not a _memory_, whatever\nelse it may be; it is simply a duplicate, a second event, having\nabsolutely no connection with the first event except that it happens\nto resemble it. The clock strikes to-day; it struck yesterday; and\nmay strike a million times ere it wears out. The rain pours through\nthe gutter this week; it did so last week; and will do so _in s\u00e6cula\ns\u00e6culorum_. But does the present clock-stroke become aware of the\npast ones, or the present stream recollect the past stream, because\nthey repeat and resemble them? Assuredly not. And let it not be said\nthat this is because clock-strokes and gutters are physical and not\npsychical objects; for psychical objects (sensations for example)\nsimply recurring in successive editions will remember each other _on\nthat account_ no more than clock-strokes do. No memory is involved in\nthe mere fact of recurrence. The successive editions of a feeling are\nso many independent events, each snug in its own skin. Yesterday's\nfeeling is dead and buried; and the presence of to-day's is no reason\nwhy it should resuscitate. A farther condition is required before the\npresent image can be held to stand for a _past original_.\nThat condition is that the fact imaged be _expressly referred to the\npast_, thought as _in the past_. But how can we think a thing as in\nthe past, except by thinking of the past together with the thing,\nand of the relation of the two? And how can we think of the past? In\nthe chapter on Time-perception we have seen that our intuitive or\nimmediate consciousness of pastness hardly carries us more than a\nfew seconds backward of the present instant of time. Remoter dates\nare conceived, not perceived; known symbolically by names, such as\n'last week,' '1850;' or thought of by events which happened in them,\nas the year in which we attended such a school, or met with such a\nloss.--So that if we wish to think of a particular past epoch, we must\nthink of a name or other symbol, or else of certain concrete events,\nassociated therewithal. Both must be thought of, to think the past\nepoch adequately. And to 'refer' any special fact to the past epoch is\nto think that fact _with_ the names and events which characterize its\ndate, to think it, in short, with a lot of contiguous associates.\nBut even this would not be memory. Memory requires more than mere\ndating of a fact in the past. It must be dated in _my_ past. In other\nwords, I must think that I directly experienced its occurrence. It must\nhave that 'warmth and intimacy' which were so often spoken of in the\nchapter on the Self, as characterizing all experiences 'appropriated'\nby the thinker as his own.\nA general feeling of the past direction in time, then, a particular\ndate conceived as lying along that direction, and I defined by its name\nor phenomenal contents, an event imagined as located therein, and owned\nas part of my experience,--such are the elements of every act of memory.\nIt follows that what we began by calling the 'image,' or 'copy,' of\nthe fact in the mind, is really not there at all in that simple shape,\nas a separate 'idea.' Or at least, if it be there as a separate idea,\nno memory will go with it. What memory goes with is, on the contrary,\na very complex representation, that of the fact to be recalled _plus_\nits associates, the whole forming one 'object' (as explained on page\n275, Chapter IX), known in one integral pulse of consciousness (as set\nforth on pp. 276 ff.) and demanding probably a vastly more intricate\nbrain-process than that on which any simple sensorial image depends.\nMost psychologists have given a perfectly clear analysis of the\nphenomenon we describe. Christian Wolff, for example, writes:\n\"Suppose you have seen Mevius in the temple, but now afresh in Titus'\nhouse. I say you _recognize_ Mevius, that is, are conscious of having\nseen him before because, although now you perceive him with your\nsenses along with Titus' house, your imagination produces an image of\nhim along with one of the temple, and of the acts of your own mind\nreflecting on Mevius in the temple. Hence the idea of Mevius which is\nreproduced in sense is contained in another series of perceptions than\nthat which formerly contained it, and this difference is the reason\nwhy we are conscious of having had it before.... For whilst now you\nsee Mevius in the house of Titus, your imagination places him in the\ntemple, and renders you conscious of the state of mind which you found\nin yourself when you beheld him there. By this you know that you have\nseen him before, that is, you recognize him. But you recognize him\nbecause his idea is now contained in another series of perceptions\nfrom that in which you first saw him.\"[577]\nSimilarly James Mill writes:\n\"In my remembrance of George III., addressing the two houses of\nparliament, there is, first of all, the mere idea, or simple\napprehension, the conception, as it is sometimes called, of the\nobjects. There is combined with this, to make it memory, my idea of my\nhaving seen and heard those objects. And this combination is so close\nthat it is not in my power to separate them. I cannot have the idea of\nGeorge III.: his person and attitude, the paper he held in his hand,\nthe sound of his voice while reading from it; without having the other\nidea along with it, that of my having been a witness of the scene....\nIf this explanation of the case in which we remember sensations is\nunderstood, the explanation of the case in which we remember ideas\ncannot occasion much of difficulty. I have a lively recollection of\nPolyphemus's cave, and the actions of Ulysses and the Cyclops, as\ndescribed by Homer. In this recollection there is, first of all, the\nideas, or simple conceptions of the objects and acts; and along with\nthese ideas, and so closely combined as not to be separable, the idea\nof my having formerly had those same ideas. And this idea of my having\nformerly had those ideas is a very complicated idea; including the\nidea of myself of the present moment remembering, and that of myself\nof the past moment conceiving; and the whole series of the states of\nconsciousness, which intervened between myself remembering, and myself\nconceiving.\"[578]\nMemory is then the feeling of belief in a peculiar complex object;\nbut all the elements of this object may be known to other states\nof belief; nor is there in the particular combination of them as\nthey appear in memory anything so peculiar as to lead us to oppose\nthe latter to other sorts of thought as something altogether _sui\ngeneris_, needing a special faculty to account for it. When later\nwe come to our chapter on Belief we shall see that any represented\nobject which is connected either mediately or immediately with our\npresent sensations or emotional activities tends to be believed in as\na reality. The sense of a peculiar active relation in it to ourselves\nis what gives to an object the characteristic quality of reality, and a\nmerely imagined past event differs from a recollected one only in the\nabsence of this peculiar-feeling relation. The electric current, so to\nspeak, between it and our present self does not close. But in their\nother determinations the re-recollected past and the imaginary past\nmay be much the same. In other words, there is nothing unique in the\n_object_ of memory, and no special faculty is needed to account for its\nformation. It is a synthesis of parts thought of as related together,\nperception, imagination, comparison and reasoning being analogous\nsyntheses of parts into complex objects. The objects of any of these\nfaculties may awaken belief or fail to awaken it; _the object of memory\nis only an object imagined in the past_ (usually very completely\nimagined there) _to which the emotion of belief adheres._\nMEMORY'S CAUSES.\nSuch being the _phenomenon_ of memory, or the analysis of its object,\ncan we see how it comes to pass? can we lay bare its causes?\nIts complete exercise presupposes two things:\n1) The _retention_ of the remembered fact;\n2) Its _reminiscence, recollection, reproduction,_ or _recall_.\nNow _the cause both of retention and of recollection is the law of\nhabit in the nervous system, working as it does in the 'association of\nideas.'_\nAssociationists have long explained _recollection_ by association.\nJames Mill gives an account of it which I am unable to improve upon,\nunless it might be by translating his word 'idea' into 'thing thought\nof,' or 'object,' as explained so often before.\n\"There is,\" he says, \"a state of mind familiar to all men, in which\nwe are said to remember. In this state it is certain we have not in\nthe mind the idea which we are trying to have in it.[579] How is\nit, then, that we proceed in the course of our endeavor, to procure\nits introduction into the mind? If we have not the idea itself, we\nhave certain ideas connected with it. We run over those ideas, one\nafter another, in hopes that some one of them will suggest the idea\nwe are in quest of; and if any one of them does, it is always one\nso connected with it as to call it up in the way of association. I\nmeet an old acquaintance, whose name I do not remember, and wish to\nrecollect. I run over a number of names, in hopes that some of them\nmay be associated with the idea of the individual. I think of all\nthe circumstances in which I have seen him engaged; the time when I\nknew him, the persons along with whom I knew him, the things he did,\nor the things he suffered; and, if I chance upon any idea with which\nthe name is associated, then immediately I have the recollection; if\nnot, my pursuit of it is vain.[580] There is another set of cases,\nvery familiar, but affording very important evidence on the subject.\nIt frequently happens that there are matters which we desire not\nto forget. What is the contrivance to which we have recourse for\npreserving the memory--that is, for making sure that it will be called\ninto existence, when it is our wish that it should? All men invariably\nemploy the same expedient. They endeavor to form an association\nbetween the idea of the thing to be remembered, and some sensation,\nor some idea, which they know beforehand will occur at or near the\ntime when they wish the remembrance to be in their minds. If this\nassociation is formed, and the association or idea with which it has\nbeen formed occurs; the sensation, or idea, calls up the remembrance;\nand the object of him who formed the association is attained. To use\na vulgar instance: a man receives a commission from his friend, and,\nthat he may not forget it, ties a knot in his handkerchief. How is\nthis fact to be explained? First of all, the idea of the commission\nis associated with the making of the knot. Next, the handkerchief is\na thing which it is known beforehand will be frequently seen, and of\ncourse at no great distance of time from the occasion on which the\nmemory is desired. The handkerchief being seen, the knot is seen, and\nthis sensation recalls the idea of the commission, between which and\nitself the association had been purposely formed.\"[581]\nIn short, we make search in our memory for a forgotten idea, just as\nwe rummage our house for a lost object. In both cases we visit what\nseems to us the probable _neighborhood_ of that which we miss. We turn\nover the things under which, or within which, or alongside of which,\nit may possibly be; and if it lies near them, it soon comes to view.\nBut these matters, in the case of a mental object sought, are nothing\nbut its _associates_. The machinery of recall is thus the same as the\nmachinery of association, and the machinery of association, as we know,\nis nothing but the elementary law of habit in the nerve-centres.\nAnd this same law of habit is the machinery of retention also.\nRetention means _liability_ to recall, and it means nothing more than\nsuch liability. The only proof of there being retention is that recall\nactually takes place. The retention of an experience is, in short,\nbut another name for the _possibility_ of thinking it again, or the\n_tendency_ to think it again, with its past surroundings. Whatever\naccidental cue may turn this tendency into an actuality, the permanent\n_ground_ of the tendency itself lies in the organized neural paths by\nwhich the cue calls up the experience on the proper occasion, together\nwith its past associates, the sense that the self was there, the belief\nthat it really happened, etc., etc., just as previously described.\nWhen the recollection is of the 'ready' sort, the resuscitation takes\nplace the instant the occasion arises; when it is slow, resuscitation\ncomes after delay. But be the recall prompt or slow, the condition\nwhich makes it possible at all (or in other words, the 'retention' of\nthe experience) is neither more nor less than the brain-paths which\n_associate_ the experience with the occasion and cue of the recall.\n_When slumbering, these paths are the condition of retention; when\nactive, they are the condition of recall._\n*       *       *       *       *\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.]\nA simple scheme will now make the whole cause of memory plain. Let _n_\nbe a past event; _o_ its 'setting' (concomitants, date, self present,\nwarmth and intimacy, etc., etc., as already set forth); and _m_ some\npresent thought or fact which may appropriately become the occasion of\nits recall. Let the nerve-centres, active in the thought of _m, n,_ and\n_o,_ be represented by M, N, and O, respectively; then the _existence_\nof the paths M--N and N--O will be the fact indicated by the phrase\n'retention of the event _n_ in the memory,' and the _excitement_ of\nthe brain along these paths will be the condition of the event _n_'s\nactual recall. The _retention_ of _n_, it will be observed, is no\nmysterious storing up of an 'idea' in an unconscious state. It is not\na fact of the mental order at all. It is a purely physical phenomenon,\na morphological feature, the presence of these 'paths,' namely, in the\nfinest recesses of the brain's tissue. The recall or recollection, on\nthe other hand, is a _psycho-physical_ phenomenon, with both a bodily\nand a mental side. The bodily side is the functional excitement of the\ntracts and paths in question; the mental side is the conscious vision\nof the past occurrence, and the belief that we experienced it before.\nThese habit-worn paths of association are a clear rendering of what\nauthors mean by 'predispositions,' 'vestiges,' 'traces,' etc., left in\nthe brain by past experience. Most writers leave the nature of these\nvestiges vague; few think of explicitly assimilating them to channels\nof association. Dr. Maudsley, for example, writes:\n\"When an idea which we have once had is excited again, there is\na reproduction of the same nervous current, with the conscious\naddition that it is a reproduction--it is the same idea _plus_ the\nconsciousness that it is the same. The question then suggests itself,\nWhat is the physical condition of this consciousness? What is the\nmodification of the anatomical substrata of fibres and cells, or of\ntheir physiological activity, which is the occasion of this _plus_\nelement in the reproduced idea? It may be supposed that the first\nactivity did leave behind it, when it subsided, some after-effect,\nsome modification of the nerve-element, whereby the nerve-circuit was\ndisposed to fall again readily into the same action; such disposition\nappearing in consciousness as recognition or memory. Memory is, in\nfact, the conscious phase of this physiological disposition when it\nbecomes active or discharges its functions on the recurrence of the\nparticular mental experience. To assist our conception of what may\nhappen, let us suppose the individual nerve-elements to be endowed\nwith their own consciousness, and let us assume them to be, as I have\nsupposed, modified in a certain way by the first experience; it is\nhard to conceive that when they fall into the same action on another\noccasion they should not recognize or remember it; for the second\naction is a reproduction of the first, with the addition of what it\ncontains from the after-effects of the first. As we have assumed the\nprocess to be conscious, this reproduction with its addition would be\na memory or remembrance.\"[582]\nIn this passage Dr. Maudsley seems to mean by the 'nerve-element,' or\n'anatomical substratum of fibres and cells,' something that corresponds\nto the N of our diagram. And the 'modification' he speaks of seems\nintended to be understood as an internal modification of this same\nparticular group of elements. Now the slightest reflection will\nconvince anyone that there is no conceivable ground for supposing that\nwith the mere re-excitation of N there should arise the 'conscious\naddition' that it is a re-excitation. The two excitations are simply\ntwo excitations, their consciousnesses are two consciousnesses, they\nhave nothing to do with each other. And a vague 'modification,'\nsupposed to be left behind by the first excitation, helps us not a\nwhit. For, according to all analogy, such a modification can only\nresult in making the next excitation more smooth and rapid. This might\nmake it less _conscious_, perhaps, but could not endow it with any\nreference to the past. The gutter is worn deeper by each successive\nshower, but not for that reason brought into contact with previous\nshowers. Psychology (which Dr. Maudsley in his next sentence says\n\"affords us not the least help in this matter\") puts us on the track of\nan at least possible brain-explanation. As it is the _setting o_ of the\nidea, when it recurs, which makes us conscious of it as past, so it can\nbe no _intrinsic_ modification of the 'nerve-element' N which is the\norganic condition of memory, but something extrinsic to it altogether,\nnamely, its connections with those other nerve-elements which we called\nO--that letter standing in the scheme for the cerebral substratum of\na great plexus of things other than the principal event remembered,\ndates, names, concrete surroundings, realized intervals, and what not.\nThe 'modification' is the formation in the plastic nerve-substance of\nthe system of associative paths between N and O.\nThe only hypothesis, in short, to which the facts of inward experience\ngive countenance is that _the brain-tracts excited by the event proper,\nand those excited in its recall, are in part different from each\nother_. If we could revive the past event without any associates we\nshould exclude the possibility of memory, and simply dream that we were\nundergoing the experience as if for the first time.[583] Wherever, in\nfact, the recalled event does appear without a definite setting, it is\nhard to distinguish it from a mere creation of fancy. But in proportion\nas its image lingers and recalls associates which gradually become more\ndefinite, it grows more and more distinctly into a remembered thing.\nFor example, I enter a friend's room and see on the wall a painting.\nAt first I have the strange, wondering consciousness, 'surely I have\nseen that before,' but when or how does not become clear. There only\nclings to the picture a sort of penumbra of familiarity,--when suddenly\nI exclaim: \"I have it, it is a copy of part of one of the Fra Angelicos\nin the Florentine Academy--I recollect it there!\" But the motive to\nthe recall does _not_ lie in the fact that the brain-tract now excited\nby the painting was once before excited in a similar way; it lies\nsimply and solely in the fact that with that brain-tract other tracts\nalso are excited: those which sustain my friend's room with all its\npeculiarities, on the one hand; those which sustain the mental image of\nthe Florence Academy, on the other hand, with the circumstances of my\nvisit there; and finally those which make me (more dimly) think of the\nyears I have lived through between these two times. The result of this\ntotal brain-disturbance is a thought with a peculiar object, namely,\nthat I who now stand here with this picture before me, stood so many\nyears ago in the Florentine Academy looking at its original.\nM. Taine has described the gradual way in which a mental image develops\ninto an object of memory, in his usual vivid fashion. He says:\n\"I meet casually in the street a person whose appearance I am\nacquainted with, and say to myself at once that I have seen him\nbefore. Instantly the figure recedes into the past, and wavers about\nthere vaguely, without at once fixing itself in any spot. It persists\nin me for some time, and surrounds itself with new details. 'When\nI saw him he was bare-headed, with a working-jacket on, painting in\na studio; he is so-and-so, of such-and-such a street. But when was\nit? It was not yesterday, nor this week, nor recently. I have it: he\ntold me that he was waiting for the first leaves to come out to go\ninto the country. It was before the spring. But at what exact date?\nI saw, the same day, people carrying branches in the streets and\nomnibuses: it was Palm Sunday!' Observe the travels of the internal\nfigure, its various shiftings to front and rear along the line of the\npast; each of these mental sentences has been a swing of the balance.\nWhen confronted with the present sensation and with the latent swarm\nof indistinct images which repeat our recent life, the figure first\nrecoiled suddenly to an indeterminate distance. Then, completed by\nprecise details, and confronted with all the shortened images by\nwhich we sum up the proceedings of a day or a week, it again receded\nbeyond the present day, beyond yesterday, the day before, the week,\nstill farther, beyond the ill-defined mass constituted by our recent\nrecollections. Then something said by the painter was recalled, and it\nat once receded again beyond an almost precise limit, which is marked\nby the image of the green leaves and denoted by the word spring. A\nmoment afterwards, thanks to a new detail, the recollection of the\nbranches, it has shifted again, but forward this time, not backward;\nand, by a reference to the calendar, is situated at a precise point,\na week further back than Easter, and five weeks nearer than the\ncarnival, by the double effect of the contrary impulsions, pushing it,\none forward and the other backward, and which are, at a particular\nmoment, annulled by one another.\"[584]\nTHE CONDITIONS OF GOODNESS IN MEMORY.\nThe remembered fact being _n_, then, the path N--O is what arouses\nfor _n_ its setting when it _is_ recalled, and makes it other than a\nmere imagination. The path M--N, on the other hand, gives the cue or\noccasion of its being recalled at all. _Memory being this altogether\nconditioned on brain-paths, its excellence in a given individual will\ndepend partly on the number and partly on the persistence of these\npaths._\nThe persistence or permanence of the paths is a physiological\nproperty of the brain-tissue of the individual, whilst their number\nis altogether due to the facts of his mental experience. Let the\nquality of permanence in the paths be called the native tenacity, or\nphysiological retentiveness. This tenacity differs enormously from\ninfancy to old age, and from one person to another. Some minds are like\nwax under a seal--no impression, however disconnected with others,\nis wiped out. Others, like a jelly, vibrate to every touch, but under\nusual conditions retain no permanent mark. These latter minds, before\nthey can recollect a fact, must weave it into their permanent stores\nof knowledge. They have no _desultory_ memory. Those persons, on the\ncontrary, who retain names, dates and addresses, anecdotes, gossip,\npoetry, quotations, and all sorts of miscellaneous facts, without an\neffort, have desultory memory in a high degree, and certainly owe it\nto the unusual tenacity of their brain-substance for any path once\nformed therein. No one probably was ever effective on a voluminous\nscale without a high degree of this physiological retentiveness. In the\npractical as in the theoretic life, the man whose acquisitions _stick_\nis the man who is always achieving and advancing, whilst his neighbors,\nspending most of their time in relearning what they once knew but have\nforgotten, simply hold their own. A Charlemagne, a Luther, a Leibnitz,\na Walter Scott, any example, in short, of your quarto or folio editions\nof mankind, must needs have amazing retentiveness of the purely\nphysiological sort. Men without this retentiveness may excel in the\n_quality_ of their work at this point or at that, but will never do\nsuch mighty sums of it, or be influential contemporaneously on such a\nscale.[585]\nBut there comes a time of life for all of us when we can do no more\nthan hold our own in the way of acquisitions, when the old paths fade\nas fast as the new ones form in our brain, and when we forget in a\nweek quite as much as we can learn in the same space of time. This\nequilibrium may last many, many years. In extreme old age it is upset\nin the reverse direction, and forgetting prevails over acquisition or\nrather there is no acquisition. Brain-paths are so transient that in\nthe course of a few minutes of conversation the same question is asked\nand its answer forgotten half a dozen times. Then the superior tenacity\nof the paths formed in childhood becomes manifest: the dotard will\nretrace the facts of his earlier years after he has lost all those of\nlater date.\nSo much for the permanence of the paths. Now for their number.\nIt is obvious that the more there are of such paths as M--N in the\nbrain, and the more of such possible cues or occasions for the recall\nof _n_ in the mind, the prompter and surer, on the whole, the memory\nof _n_ will be, the more frequently one will be reminded of it, the\nmore avenues of approach to it one will possess. In mental terms, _the\nmore other facts a fact is associated with in the mind, the better\npossession of it our memory retains._ Each of its associates becomes\na hook to which it hangs, a means to fish it up by when sunk beneath\nthe surface. Together, they form a network of attachments by which it\nis woven into the entire tissue of our thought. The 'secret of a good\nmemory' is thus the secret of forming diverse and multiple associations\nwith every fact we care to retain. But this forming of associations\nwith a fact, what is it but _thinking about_ the fact as much as\npossible? Briefly, then, of two men with the same outward experiences\nand the same amount of mere native tenacity, _the one who_ THINKS _over\nhis experiences most,_ and weaves them into systematic relations with\neach other, _will be the one with the best memory_. We see examples of\nthis on every hand. Most men have a good memory for facts connected\nwith their own pursuits. The college athlete who remains a dunce at\nhis books will astonish you by his knowledge of men's 'records' in\nvarious feats and games, and will be a walking dictionary of sporting\nstatistics. The reason is that he is constantly going over these things\nin his mind, and comparing and making series of them. They form for\nhim not so many odd facts, but a concept-system--so they stick. So the\nmerchant remembers prices, the politician other politicians' speeches\nand votes, with a copiousness which amazes outsiders, but which the\namount of thinking they bestow on these subjects easily explains. The\ngreat memory for facts which a Darwin and a Spencer reveal in their\nbooks is not incompatible with the possession on their part of a brain\nwith only a middling degree of physiological retentiveness. Let a\nman early in life set himself the task of verifying such a theory as\nthat of evolution, and facts will soon cluster and cling to him like\ngrapes to their stem. Their relations to the theory will hold them\nfast; and the more of these the mind is able to discern, the greater\nthe erudition will become. Meanwhile the theorist may have little, if\nany, desultory memory. Unutilizable facts may be unnoted by him and\nforgotten as soon as heard. An ignorance almost as encyclop\u00e6dic as his\nerudition may coexist with the latter, and hide, as it were, in the\ninterstices of its web. Those who have had much to do with scholars and\n_savants_ will readily think of examples of the class of mind I mean.\nIn a system, every fact is connected with every other by some\nthought-relation. The consequence is that every fact is retained by the\ncombined suggestive power of all the other facts in the system, and\nforgetfulness is well-nigh impossible.\nThe reason why _cramming_ is such a bad mode of study is now made\nclear. I mean by cramming that way of preparing for examinations by\ncommitting 'points' to memory during a few hours or days of intense\napplication immediately preceding the final ordeal, little or no work\nhaving been performed during the previous course of the term. Things\nlearned thus in a few hours, on one occasion, for one purpose, cannot\npossibly have formed many associations with other things in the mind.\nTheir brain-processes are led into by few paths, and are relatively\nlittle liable to be awakened again. Speedy oblivion is the almost\ninevitable fate of all that is committed to memory in this simple\nway. Whereas, on the contrary, the same materials taken in gradually,\nday after day, recurring in different contexts, considered in various\nrelations, associated with other external incidents, and repeatedly\nreflected on, grow into such a system, form such connections with the\nrest of the mind's fabric, lie open to so many paths of approach, that\nthey remain permanent possessions. This is the _intellectual_ reason\nwhy habits of continuous application should be enforced in educational\nestablishments. Of course there is no moral turpitude in cramming. If\nit led to the desired end of secure learning it would be infinitely the\nbest method of study. But it does not; and students themselves should\nunderstand the reason why.\nONE'S NATIVE RETENTIVENESS IS UNCHANGEABLE.\nIt will now appear clear that _all improvement of the memory lies in\nthe line of_ ELABORATING THE ASSOCIATES of each of the several things\nto be remembered. _No amount of culture would seem capable of modifying\na man's_ GENERAL _retentiveness_. This is a physiological quality,\ngiven once for all with his organization, and which he can never hope\nto change. It differs no doubt in disease and health; and it is a fact\nof observation that it is better in fresh and vigorous hours than when\nwe are fagged or ill. We may say, then, that a man's native tenacity\nwill fluctuate somewhat with his hygiene, and that whatever is good\nfor his tone of health will also be good for his memory. We may even\nsay that whatever amount of intellectual exercise is bracing to the\ngeneral tone and nutrition of the brain will also be profitable to the\ngeneral retentiveness. But more than this we cannot say; and this, it\nis obvious, is far less than most people believe.\nIt is, in fact, commonly thought that certain exercises, systematically\nrepeated, will strengthen, not only a man's remembrance of the\nparticular facts used in the exercises, but his faculty for remembering\nfacts at large. And a plausible case is always made out by saying\nthat practice in learning words by heart makes it easier to learn new\nwords in the same way.[586] If this be true, then what I have just\nsaid is false, and the whole doctrine of memory as due to 'paths'\nmust be revised. But I am disposed to think the alleged fact untrue.\nI have carefully questioned several mature actors on the point, and\nall have denied that the practice of learning parts has made any such\ndifference as is alleged. What it has done for them is to improve their\npower of _studying_ a part systematically. Their mind is now full of\nprecedents in the way of intonation, emphasis, gesticulation; the new\nwords awaken distinct suggestions and decisions; are caught up, in\nfact, into a pre-existing net-work, like the merchant's prices, or the\nathlete's store of 'records,' and are recollected easier, although\nthe mere native tenacity is not a whit improved, and is usually, in\nfact, impaired by age. It is a case of better remembering by better\n_thinking_. Similarly when schoolboys improve by practice in ease of\nlearning by heart, the improvement will, I am sure, be always found\nto reside in the _mode of study of the particular piece_ (due to the\ngreater interest, the greater suggestiveness, the generic similarity\nwith other pieces, the more sustained attention, etc., etc.), and not\nat all to any enhancement of the brute retentive power.\nThe error I speak of pervades an otherwise useful and judicious book,\n'How to Strengthen the Memory,' by Dr. Holbrook of New York.[587]\nThe author fails to distinguish between the general physiological\nretentiveness and the retention of particular things, and talks as if\nboth must be benefited by the same means.\n\"I am now treating,\" he says, \"a case of loss of memory in a person\nadvanced in years, who did not know that his memory had failed most\nremarkably till I told him of it. He is making vigorous efforts to\nbring it back again, and with partial success. The method pursued is\nto spend two hours daily, one in the morning and one in the evening,\nin exercising this faculty. The patient is instructed to give the\nclosest attention to all that he learns, so that it shall be impressed\non his mind clearly. He is asked to recall every evening all the\nfacts and experiences of the day, and again the next morning. Every\nname heard is written down and impressed on his mind clearly, and an\neffort made to recall it at intervals. Ten names from among public men\nare ordered to be committed to memory every week. A verse of poetry\nis to be learned, also a verse from the Bible, daily. He is asked to\nremember the number of the page in any book where any interesting\nfact is recorded. These and other methods are slowly resuscitating a\nfailing memory.\"[588]\nI find it very hard to believe that the memory of the poor old\ngentleman is a bit the better for all this torture except in respect of\nthe particular facts thus wrought into it, the occurrences attended to\nand repeated on those days, the names of those politicians, those Bible\nverses, etc., etc. In another place Dr. Holbrook quotes the account\ngiven by the late Thurlow Weed, journalist and politician, of his\nmethod of strengthening his memory.\n\"My memory was a sieve. I could remember nothing. Dates, names,\nappointments, faces--everything escaped me. I said to my wife,\n'Catherine, I shall never make a successful politician, for I cannot\nremember, and that is a prime necessity of politicians.' My wife\ntold me I must train my memory. So when I came home that night, I\nsat down alone and spent fifteen minutes trying silently to recall\nwith accuracy the principal events of the day. I could remember but\nlittle at first; now I remember that I could not then recall what I\nhad for breakfast. After a few days' practice I found I could recall\nmore. Events came back to me more minutely, more accurately, and more\nvividly than at first. After a fortnight or so of this, Catherine\nsaid, 'Why don't you relate to me the events of the day, instead of\nrecalling them to yourself? It would be interesting, and my interest\nin it would be a stimulus to you.' Having great respect for my wife's\nopinion, I began a habit of oral confession, as it were, which was\ncontinued for almost fifty years. Every night, the last thing before\nretiring, I told her everything I could remember that had happened to\nme or about me during the day. I generally recalled the dishes I had\nhad for breakfast, dinner, and tea; the people I had seen and what\nthey had said; the editorials I had written for my paper, giving her\na brief abstract of them. I mentioned all the letters I had sent and\nreceived, and the very language used, as nearly as possible; when\nI had walked or ridden--I told her everything that had come within\nmy observation. I found I could say my lessons better and better\nevery year, and instead of the practice growing irksome, it became a\npleasure to go over again the events of the day. I am indebted to this\ndiscipline for a memory of somewhat unusual tenacity, and I recommend\nthe practice to all who wish to store up facts, or expect to have much\nto do with influencing men.\"[589]\nI do not doubt that Mr. Weed's practical command of his past\nexperiences was much greater after fifty years of this heroic drill\nthan it would have been without it. Expecting to give his account in\nthe evening, he attended better to each incident of the day, named and\nconceived it differently, set his mind upon it, and in the evening went\nover it again. He did _more thinking_ about it, and it stayed with him\nin consequence. But I venture to affirm pretty confidently (although\nI know how foolish it often is to deny a fact on the strength of a\ntheory) that the same matter, _casually attended to and not thought\nabout,_ would have stuck in his memory no better at the end than at\nthe beginning of his years of heroic self-discipline. He had acquired\na better method of noting and recording his experiences, but his\nphysiological retentiveness was probably not a bit improved.[590]\n_All improvement of memory consists, then, in the improvement of one's\nhabitual methods of recording facts._ In the traditional terminology\nmethods are divided into the mechanical, the ingenious, and the\njudicious.\nThe _mechanical methods_ consist in the intensification, prolongation,\nand _repetition_ of the impression to be remembered. The modern method\nof teaching children to read by blackboard work, in which each word is\nimpressed by the four-fold channel of eye, ear, voice, and hand, is an\nexample of an improved mechanical method of memorizing.\n_Judicious methods_ of remembering things are nothing but logical ways\nof conceiving them and working them into rational systems, classifying\nthem, analyzing them into parts, etc., etc. All the sciences are such\nmethods.\nOf _ingenious methods_, many have been invented, under the name of\ntechnical memories. By means of these systems it is often possible to\nretain entirely disconnected facts, lists of names, numbers, and so\nforth, so multitudinous as to be entirely unrememberable in a natural\nway. The method consists usually in a framework learned mechanically,\nof which the mind is supposed to remain in secure and permanent\npossession. Then, whatever is to be remembered is deliberately\nassociated by some fanciful analogy or connection with some part of\nthis framework, and this connection thenceforward helps its recall.\nThe best known and most used of these devices is the figure-alphabet.\nTo remember numbers, e.g., a figure-alphabet is first formed, in which\neach numerical digit is represented by one or more letters. The number\nis then translated into such letters as will best make a word, if\npossible a word suggestive of the object to which the number belongs.\nThe word will then be remembered when the numbers alone might be\nforgotten.\n\"The most common figure-alphabet is this:\n1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,    7,   8,   9,   0.\nt,   n,   m,   r,   l,   sh,   g,   f,   b,   s,\nd,                       j,    k,   v,   p,   c,\nch,   c,             z,\ng,    qu.\n\"To briefly show its use, suppose it is desired to fix 1142 feet in a\nsecond as the velocity of sound: t, t, r, n, are the letters and order\nrequired. Fill up with vowels forming a phrase, like 'tight run' and\nconnect it by some such flight of the imagination as that if a man\ntried to keep up with the velocity of sound, he would have a tight\nrun. When you recall this a few days later great care must be taken\nnot to get confused with the velocity of light, nor to think he had a\n_hard_ run which would be 3000 feet too fast.\"[591]\nDr. Pick and others use a system which consists in linking together any\ntwo ideas to be remembered by means of an intermediate idea which will\nbe suggested by the first and suggest the second, and so on through the\nlist. Thus,\n\"Let us suppose that we are to retain the following series of ideas:\ngarden, hair, watchman, philosophy, copper, etc.... We can combine the\nideas in this manner: _garden,_ plant, hair of plant--_hair; hair,_\nbonnet, _watchman;--watchman,_ wake, study, _philosophy; philosophy,_\nchemistry, _copper_; etc. etc.\" (Pick.)[592]\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt is matter of popular knowledge that an impression is remembered the\nbetter in proportion as it is\n1) More recent;\n2) More attended to; and\n3) More often repeated.\nThe effect of recency is all but absolutely constant. Of two events\nof equal significance the remoter one will be the one more likely\nto be forgotten. The memories of childhood which persist in old age\ncan hardly be compared with the events of the day or hour which are\nforgotten, for these latter are trivial once-repeated things, whilst\nthe childish reminiscences have been wrought into us during the\nretrospective hours of our entire intervening life. _Other things\nequal_, at all times of life recency promotes memory. The only\nexception I can think of is the unaccountable memory of certain moments\nof our childhood, apparently not fitted by their intrinsic interest to\nsurvive, but which are perhaps the only incidents we can remember out\nof the year in which they occurred. Everybody probably has isolated\nglimpses of certain hours of his nursery life, the position in which he\nstood or sat, the light of the room, what his father or mother said,\netc. These moments so oddly selected for immunity from the tooth of\ntime probably owe their good fortune to historical peculiarities which\nit is now impossible to trace. Very likely we were reminded of them\nagain soon after they occurred; that became a reason why we should\nagain recollect them, etc., so that at last they became ingrained.\nThe _attention_ which we lend to an experience is proportional to its\nvivid or interesting character; and it is a notorious fact that what\ninterests us most vividly at the time is, other things equal, what we\nremember best. An impression may be so exciting emotionally as almost\nto leave a _scar_ upon the cerebral tissues; and thus originates a\npathological delusion. \"A woman attacked by robbers takes all the\nmen whom she sees, even her own son, for brigands bent on killing\nher. Another woman sees her child run over by a horse; no amount of\nreasoning, not even the sight of the living child, will persuade her\nthat he is not killed. A woman called 'thief' in a dispute remains\nconvinced that every one accuses her of stealing (Esquirol). Another,\nattacked with mania at the sight of the fires in her street during the\nCommune, still after six months sees in her delirium flames on every\nside about her (Luys), etc., etc.\"[593]\nOn the general effectiveness of both attention and repetition I cannot\ndo better than copy what M. Taine has written:\n\"If we compare different sensations, images, or ideas, we find that\ntheir aptitudes for revival are not equal. A large number of them\nare obliterated, and never reappear through life; for instance, I\ndrove through Paris a day or two ago, and though I saw plainly some\nsixty or eighty new faces, I cannot now recall any one of them; some\nextraordinary circumstance, a fit of delirium, or the excitement of\nhaschish would be necessary to give them a chance of revival. On the\nother hand, there are sensations with a force of revival which nothing\ndestroys or decreases. Though, as a rule, time weakens and impairs\nour strongest sensations, these reappear entire and intense, without\nhaving lost a particle of their detail, or any degree of their force.\nM. Brierre de Boismont, having suffered when a child from a disease\nof the scalp, asserts that 'after fifty-five years have elapsed\nhe can still feel his hair pulled out under the treatment of the\n_skull-cap_.'--For my own part, after thirty years, I remember feature\nfor feature the appearance of the theatre to which I was taken for\nthe first time. From the third row of boxes, the body of the theatre\nappeared to me an immense well, red and flaming, swarming with heads;\nbelow, on the right, on a narrow floor, two men and a woman entered,\nwent out, and re-entered, made gestures, and seemed to me like lively\ndwarfs: to my great surprise, one of these dwarfs fell on his knees,\nkissed the lady's hand, then hid behind a screen; the other, who was\ncoming in, seemed angry, and raised his arm. I was then seven, I could\nunderstand nothing of what was going on; but the well of crimson\nvelvet was so crowded, gilded, and bright, that after a quarter of an\nhour I was, as it were, intoxicated, and fell asleep.\n\"Every one of us may find similar recollections in his memory, and\nmay distinguish in them a common character. The primitive impression\nhas been accompanied _by an extraordinary degree of attention_,\neither as being horrible or delightful, or as being new, surprising,\nand out of proportion to the ordinary run of our life; this it is we\nexpress by saying that we have been strongly impressed; that we were\nabsorbed, that we could not think of anything else; that our other\nsensations were effaced; that we were pursued all the next day by the\nresulting image; that it beset us, that we could not drive it away;\nthat all distractions were feeble beside it. It is by force of this\ndisproportion that impressions of childhood are so persistent; the\nmind being quite fresh, ordinary objects and events are surprising.\nAt present, after seeing so many large halls and full theatres, it is\nimpossible for me, when I enter one, to feel swallowed up, engulfed,\nand, as it were, lost in a huge dazzling well. The medical man of\nsixty, who has experienced much suffering, both personally and in\nimagination, would be less upset now by a surgical operation than when\nhe was a child.\n\"Whatever may be the kind of attention, voluntary or involuntary,\nit always acts alike; the image of an object or event is capable of\nrevival, and of complete revival, in proportion to the degree of\nattention with which we have considered the object or event. We put\nthis rule in practice at every moment in ordinary life. If we are\napplying ourselves to a book or are in lively conversation, while an\nair is being sung in the adjoining room, we do not retain it; we know\nvaguely that there is singing going on, and that is all. We then stop\nour reading or conversation, we lay aside all internal preoccupations\nand external sensations which our mind or the outer world can throw\nin our way; we close our eyes, we cause a silence within and about\nus, and, if the air is repeated, we listen. We say then that we have\nlistened with all our ears, that we have applied our whole minds. If\nthe air is a fine one, and has touched us deeply, we add that we have\nbeen transported, uplifted, ravished, that we have forgotten the world\nand ourselves; that for some minutes our soul was dead to all but\nsounds....\n\"This exclusive momentary ascendency of one of our states of mind\nexplains the greater durability of its aptitude for revival and for\nmore complete revival. As the sensation revives in the image, the\nimage reappears with a force proportioned to that of the sensation.\nWhat we meet with in the first state is also to be met with in the\nsecond, since the second is but a revival of the first. So, in the\nstruggle for life, in which all our images are constantly engaged, the\none furnished at the outset with most force retains in each conflict,\nby the very law of repetition which gives it being, the capacity of\ntreading down its adversaries; this is why it revives, incessantly\nat first, then frequently, until at last the laws of progressive\ndecay, and the continual accession of new impressions take away its\npreponderance, and its competitors, finding a clear field, are able to\ndevelop in their turn.\n\"A second cause of prolonged revivals is repetition itself. Every one\nknows that to learn a thing we must not only consider it attentively,\nbut consider it repeatedly. We say as to this in ordinary language,\nthat an impression many times renewed is imprinted more deeply and\nexactly on the memory. This is how we contrive to retain a language,\nairs of music, passages of verse or prose, the technical terms and\npropositions of a science, and still more so the ordinary facts by\nwhich our conduct is regulated. When, from the form and color of a\ncurrant-jelly, we think of its taste, or, when tasting it with our\neyes shut, we imagine its red tint and the brilliancy of a quivering\nslice, the images in our mind are brightened by repetition. Whenever\nwe eat, or drink, or walk, or avail ourselves of any of our senses,\nor commence or continue any action whatever, the same thing happens.\nEvery man and every animal thus possesses at every moment of life a\ncertain stock of clear and easily reviving images, which had their\nsource in the past in a confluence of numerous experiences, and are\nnow fed by a flow of renewed experiences. When I want to go from the\nTuileries to the Panth\u00e9on, or from my study to the dining-room, I\nforesee at every turn the colored forms which will present themselves\nto my sight; it is otherwise in the case of a house where I have spent\ntwo hours, or of a town where I have stayed three days; after ten\nyears have elapsed the images will be vague, full of blanks, sometimes\nthey will not exist, and I shall have to seek my way or shall lose\nmyself.--This new property of images is also derived from the first.\nAs every sensation tends to revive in its image, the sensation twice\nrepeated will leave after it a double tendency, that is, provided\nthe attention be as great the second time as the first; usually\nthis is not the case, for, the novelty diminishing, the interest\ndiminishes; but if other circumstances renew the interest, or if the\nwill renovates the attention, the incessantly increasing tendency will\nincessantly increase the chances of the resurrection and integrity of\nthe image.\"[594]\nIf a phenomenon is met with, however, too often, and with too great\na variety of contexts, although its image is retained and reproduced\nwith correspondingly great facility, it fails to come up with any one\nparticular setting, and the projection of it backwards to a particular\npast date consequently does not come about. We _recognize_ but do not\n_remember_ it--its associates form too confused a cloud. No one is said\nto remember, says Mr. Spencer,\n\"that the object at which he looks has an opposite side; or that\na certain modification of the visual impression implies a certain\ndistance; or that the thing he sees moving about is a live animal. To\nask a man whether he remembers that the sun shines, that fire burns,\nthat iron is hard, would be a misuse of language. Even the almost\nfortuitous connections among our experiences cease to be classed as\nmemories when they have become thoroughly familiar. Though, on hearing\nthe voice cf some unseen person slightly known to us, we say we\nrecollect to whom the voice belongs, we do not use the same expression\nrespecting the voices of those with whom we live. The meanings of\nwords which in childhood have to be consciously recalled seem in adult\nlife to be immediately present.\"[595]\nThese are cases where too many paths, leading to too diverse\nassociates, block each other's way, and all that the mind gets along\nwith its object is a fringe of felt familiarity or sense that there\n_are_ associates. A similar result comes about when a definite\nsetting is only nascently aroused. We then feel that we have seen the\nobject already, but when or where we cannot say, though we may seem\nto ourselves to be on the brink of saying it. That nascent cerebral\nexcitations can effect consciousness with a sort of sense of the\nimminence of that which stronger excitations would make us definitely\nfeel, is obvious from what happens when we seek to remember a name.\nIt tingles, it trembles on the verge, but does not come. Just such a\ntingling and trembling of unrecovered associates is the penumbra of\nrecognition that may surround any experience and make it seem familiar,\nthough we know not why.[596]\nThere is a curious experience which everyone seems to have had--the\nfeeling that the present moment in its completeness has been\nexperienced before--we were saying just this thing, in just this\nplace, to just these people, etc. This 'sense of pre-existence' has\nbeen treated as a great mystery and occasioned much speculation. Dr.\nWigan considered it due to a dissociation of the action of the two\nhemispheres, one of them becoming conscious a little later than the\nother, but both of the same fact.[597] I must confess that the quality\nof mystery seems to me a little strained. I have over and over again\nin my own case succeeded in resolving the phenomenon into a case of\nmemory, so indistinct that whilst some past circumstances are presented\nagain, the others are not. The dissimilar portions of the past do not\narise completely enough at first for the date to be identified, All we\nget is the present scene with a general suggestion of pastness about\nit. That faithful observer, Prof. Lazarus, interprets the phenomenon in\nthe same way;[598] and it is noteworthy that just as soon as the past\ncontext grows complete and distinct the emotion of weirdness fades from\nthe experience.\nEXACT MEASUREMENTS OF MEMORY\nhave recently been made in Germany. Professor Ebbinghaus, in a really\nheroic series of daily observations of more than two years' duration,\nexamined the powers of retention and reproduction. He learned lists of\nmeaningless syllables by heart, and tested his recollection of them\nfrom day to day. He could not remember more than 7 after a single\nreading. It took, however, 16 readings to remember 12, 44 readings to\nremember 24, and 55 readings to remember 26 syllables, the moment of\n'remembering' being here reckoned as the first moment when the list\ncould be recited without a fault.[599] When a 16-syllable list was read\nover a certain number of times on one day, and then studied on the day\nfollowing until remembered, it was found that the number of seconds\nsaved in the study on the second day was proportional to the number of\nreadings on the first--proportional, that is, within certain rather\nnarrow limits, for which see the text.[600] No amount of repetition\nspent on nonsense-verses over a certain length enabled Dr. Ebbinghaus\nto retain them without error for 24 hours. In forgetting such things\nas these lists of syllables, the loss goos on very much more rapidly\nat first than later on. He measured the loss by the number of seconds\nrequired to _relearn_ the list after it had been once learned. Roughly\nspeaking, if it took a thousand seconds to learn the list, and five\nhundred to relearn it, the loss between the two learnings would have\nbeen one half. Measured in this way, full half of the forgetting\nseems to occur within the first half-hour, whilst only four fifths is\nforgotten at the end of a month. The nature of this result might have\nbeen anticipated, but hardly its numerical proportions. Dr. Ebbinghaus\nsays:\n\"The initial rapidity, as well as the final slowness, as these were\nascertained under certain experimental conditions and for a particular\nindividual,... may well surprise us. An hour after the work of\nlearning had ceased, forgetting was so far advanced that more than\nhalf of the original work had to be applied again before the series\nof syllables could once more be reproduced. Eight hours later two\nthirds of the original labor had to be applied. Gradually, however,\nthe process of oblivion grew slower, so that even for considerable\nstretches of time the losses were but barely ascertainable. After 24\nhours a third, after 6 days a fourth, and after a whole month a good\nfifth of the original labor remain in the shape of its after-effects,\nand made the relearning by so much the more speedy.\"[601]\nBut the most interesting result of all those reached by this author\nrelates to the question whether ideas are recalled only by those\nthat previously came immediately before them, or whether an idea can\npossibly recall another idea with which it was never in _immediate_\ncontact, without passing through the intermediate mental links. The\nquestion is of theoretic importance with regard to the way in which\nthe process of 'association of ideas' must be conceived; and Dr.\nEbbinghaus's attempt is as successful as it is original, in bringing\ntwo views, which seem at first sight inaccessible to proof, to a direct\npractical test, and giving the victory to one of them. His experiments\nconclusively show that an idea is not only 'associated' directly with\nthe one that follows it, and with the rest _through that_, but that it\nis _directly_ associated with _all_ that are near it, though in unequal\ndegrees. He first measured the time needed to impress on the memory\ncertain lists of syllables, and then the time needed to impress lists\nof the same syllables with gaps between them. Thus, representing the\nsyllables by numbers, if the first list were 1, 2, 3, 4,... 13, 14, 15,\n16, the second would be 1, 3, 5,... 15, 2, 4, 6,... 16, and so forth,\nwith many variations.\nNow, if 1 and 3 in the first list were learned in that order merely\nby 1 calling up 2, and by 2 calling up 3, leaving out the 2 ought\nto leave 1 and 3 with no tie in the mind; and the second list ought\nto take as much time in the learning as if the first list had never\nbeen heard of. If, on the other hand, 1 has a _direct_ influence on\n3 as well as on 2, that influence should be exerted even when 2 is\ndropped out; and a person familiar with the first list ought to learn\nthe second one more rapidly than otherwise he could. This latter case\nis what actually occurs; and Dr. Ebbinghaus has found that syllables\noriginally separated by as many as seven intermediaries still reveal,\nby the increased rapidity with which they are learned in order, the\nstrength of the tie that the original learning established between\nthem, over the heads, so to speak, of all the rest. These last results\nought to make us careful, when we speak of nervous 'paths,' to use the\nword in no restricted sense. They add one more fact to the set of facts\nwhich prove that association is subtler than consciousness, and that a\nnerve-process may, without producing consciousness, be effective in the\nsame way in which consciousness would have seemed to be effective if it\nhad been there.[602] Evidently the path from 1 to 3 (omitting 2 from\nconsciousness) is facilitated, broadened perhaps, by the old path from\n1 to 3 through 2--only the component which shoots round through this\nlatter way is too feeble to let 2 be thought as a distinct object.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMr. Wolfe, in his experiments on recognition, used vibrating metal\ntongues.\n\"These tongues gave tones differing by 2 vibrations only in the two\nlower octaves, and by 4 vibrations in the three higher octaves. In the\nfirst series of experiments a tone was selected, and, after sounding\nit for one second, a second tone was sounded, which was either the\nsame as the first, or different from it by 4, 8, or 12 vibrations in\ndifferent series. The person experimented upon was to answer whether\nthe second tone was the same as the first, thus showing that he\nrecognized it, or whether it was different, and, if so, whether it\nwas higher or lower. Of course, the interval of time between the two\ntones was an important factor. The proportionate number of correct\njudgments, and the smallness of the difference of the vibration-rates\nof the two tones, would measure the accuracy of the tone-memory. It\nappeared that one could tell more readily when the two tones were\nalike than when they were different, although in both cases the\naccuracy of the memory was remarkably good.... The main point is the\neffect of the time-interval between the tone and its reproduction.\nThis was varied from 1 second to 30 seconds, or even to 60 seconds\nor 120 seconds in some experiments. The general result is, that the\nlonger the interval, the smaller are the chances that the tone will be\nrecognized; and this process of forgetting takes place at first very\nrapidly, and then more slowly.... This law is subject to considerable\nvariations, one of which seems to be constant and is peculiar; namely,\nthere seems to be a rhythm in the memory itself, which, after falling,\nrecovers slightly, and then fades out again.\"[603]\nThis periodical renewal of acoustic memory would seem to be an\nimportant element in the production of the agreeableness of certain\nrates of recurrence in sound.\nFORGETTING.\nIn the practical use of our intellect, forgetting is as important a\nfunction as recollecting.\nLocke says, in a memorable page of his dear old book:\n\"The memory of some men, it is true, is very tenacious, even to\na miracle; but yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our\nideas, even of those which are struck deepest, and in minds the\nmost retentive: so that if they be not sometimes renewed by repeated\nexercise of the senses, or reflection on those kinds of objects which\nat first occasioned them, the print wears out, and at last there\nremains nothing to be seen. Thus the ideas, as well as children, of\nour youth, often die before us; and our minds represent to us those\ntombs to which we are fast approaching; where, though the brass and\nmarble remain, yet the inscriptions are effaced by time, and the\nimagery moulders away. The pictures drawn in our minds are laid in\nfading colors; and, if not sometimes refreshed, vanish and disappear.\nHow much the constitution of our bodies, and the make of our animal\nspirits, are concerned in this; and whether the temper of the brain\nmakes this difference, that in some it retains the characters drawn on\nit like marble, in others like freestone, and in others little better\nthan sand, I shall not here inquire, though it may seem probable that\nthe constitution of the body does sometimes influence the memory;\nsince we oftentimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its\nideas, and the flames of a fever in a few days calcine all those\nimages to dust and confusion, which seemed to be as lasting as if\ngraven in marble.\"[604]\nThis peculiar mixture of forgetting with our remembering is but one\ninstance of our mind's selective activity. Selection is the very keel\non which our mental ship is built. And in this case of memory its\nutility is obvious. If we remembered everything, we should on most\noccasions be as ill off as if we remembered nothing. It would take\nas long for us to recall a space of time as it took the original\ntime to elapse, and we should never get ahead with our thinking.\nAll recollected times undergo, accordingly, what M. Ribot calls\nforeshortening; and this foreshortening is due to the omission of an\nenormous number of the facts which filled them.\n\"As fast as the present enters into the past, our states of\nconsciousness disappear and are obliterated. Passed in review at a\nfew days' distance, nothing or little of them remains: most of them\nhave made shipwreck in that great nonentity from which they never\nmore will emerge, and they have carried with them the quantity of\nduration which was inherent in their being. This deficit of surviving\nconscious states is thus a deficit in the amount of represented\ntime. The process of abridgment, of foreshortening, of which we have\nspoken, presupposes this deficit. If, in order to reach a distant\nreminiscence, we had to go through the entire series of terms which\nseparate it from our present selves, memory would become impossible\non account of the length of the operation. We thus reach the\nparadoxical result that one condition of remembering is that we should\nforget. Without totally forgetting a prodigious number of states of\nconsciousness, and momentarily forgetting a large number, we could not\nremember at all. Oblivion, except in certain cases, is thus no malady\nof memory, but a condition of its health and its life.\"[605]\nThere are many irregularities in the process of forgetting which are as\nyet unaccounted for. A thing forgotten on one day will be remembered on\nthe next. Something we have made the most strenuous efforts to recall,\nbut all in vain, will, soon after we have given up the attempt, saunter\ninto the mind, as Emerson somewhere says, as innocently as if it had\nnever been sent for. Experiences of bygone date will revive after years\nof absolute oblivion, often as the result of some cerebral disease or\naccident which seems to develop latent paths of association, as the\nphotographer's fluid develops the picture sleeping in the collodion\nfilm. The oftenest quoted of these cases is Coleridge's:\n\"In a Roman Catholic town in Germany, a young woman, who could neither\nread nor write, was seized with a fever, and was said by the priests\nto be possessed of a devil, because she was heard talking Latin,\nGreek, and Hebrew. Whole sheets of her ravings were written out, and\nfound to consist of sentences intelligible in themselves, but having\nslight connection with each other. Of her Hebrew sayings, only a few\ncould be traced to the Bible, and most seemed to be in the Rabbinical\ndialect. All trick was out of the question; the woman was a simple\ncreature; there was no doubt as to the fever. It was long before any\nexplanation, save that of demoniacal possession, could be obtained.\nAt last the mystery was unveiled by a physician, who determined to\ntrace back the girl's history, and who, after much trouble, discovered\nthat at the age of nine she had been charitably taken by an old\nProtestant pastor, a great Hebrew scholar, in whose house she lived\ntill his death. On further inquiry it appeared to have been the old\nman's custom for years to walk up and down a passage of his house into\nwhich the kitchen opened, and to read to himself with a loud voice\nout of his books. The books were ransacked, and among them were found\nseveral of the Greek and Latin Fathers, together with a collection of\nRabbinical writings. In these works so many of the passages taken down\nat the young woman's bedside were identified that there could be no\nreasonable doubt as to their source.\"[606]\nHypnotic subjects as a rule forget all that has happened in their\ntrance. But in a succeeding trance they will often remember the events\nof a past one. This is like what happens in those cases of 'double\npersonality' in which no recollection of one of the lives is to be\nfound in the other. We have already seen in an earlier chapter that the\nsensibility often differs from one of the alternate personalities to\nanother, and we have heard M. Pierre Janet's theory that an\u00e6sthesias\ncarry amnesias with them (see above, pp. 385 ff.). In certain cases\nthis is evidently so; the throwing of certain functional brain-tracts\nout of gear with others, so as to dissociate their consciousness from\nthat of the remaining brain, throws them out for both sensorial and\nideational service. M. Janet proved in various ways that what his\npatients forgot when an\u00e6sthetic they remembered when the sensibility\nreturned. For instance, he restored their tactile sense temporarily\nby means of electric currents, passes, etc., and then made them\nhandle various objects, such as keys and pencils, or make particular\nmovements, like the sign of the cross. The moment the an\u00e6sthesia\nreturned they found it impossible to recollect the objects or the acts.\n'They had had nothing in their hands, they had done nothing,' etc.\nThe next day, however, sensibility being again restored by similar\nprocesses, they remembered perfectly the circumstance, and told what\nthey had handled or had done.\nAll these pathological facts are showing us that the sphere of possible\nrecollection may be wider than we think, and that in certain matters\napparent oblivion is no proof against possible recall under other\nconditions. They give no countenance, however, to the extravagant\nopinion that nothing we experience can be absolutely forgotten. In\nreal life, in spite of occasional surprises, most of what happens\nactually is forgotten. The only reasons for supposing that if\nthe conditions were forthcoming everything would revive are of a\ntranscendental sort. Sir Wm. Hamilton quotes and adopts them from the\nGerman writer Schmid. Knowledge being a 'spontaneous self-energy' on\nthe part of the mind,\n\"this energy being once determined, it is natural that it should\npersist, until again annihilated by other causes. This [annihilation]\nwould be the case, were the mind merely passive.... But the mental\nactivity, the act of knowledge, of which I now speak, is more than\nthis; it is an energy of the self-active power of a subject one and\nindivisible: consequently a part of the ego must be detached or\nannihilated, if a cognition once existent be again extinguished. Hence\nit is that the problem most difficult of solution is not, how a mental\nactivity endures, but how it ever vanishes.\"[607]\nThose whom such an argument persuades may be left happy with their\nbelief. Other positive argument there is none, none certainly of a\nphysiological sort.[608]\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhen memory begins to decay, proper names are what go first, and at\nall times proper names are harder to recollect than those of general\nproperties and classes of things.\nThis seems due to the fact that common qualities and names have\ncontracted an infinitely greater number of associations in our mind\nthan the names of most of the persons whom we know. Their memory is\nbetter organized. Proper names as well organized as those of our family\nand friends are recollected as well as those of any other objects.[609]\n'Organization' means numerous associations; and the more numerous the\nassociations, the greater the number of paths of recall. For the same\nreason adjectives, conjunctions, prepositions, and the cardinal verbs,\nthose words, in short, which form the grammatical framework of all our\nspeech, are the very last to decay. Kussmaul[610] makes the following\nacute remark on this subject:\n\"The concreter a conception is, the sooner is its name forgotten. This\nis because our ideas of persons and things are less strongly bound\nup with their names than with such abstractions as their business,\ntheir circumstances, their qualities. We easily can imagine persons\nand things without their names, the sensorial image of them being\nmore important than that other symbolic image, their name. Abstract\nconceptions, on the other hand, are only acquired by means of the\nwords which alone serve to confer stability upon them. This is why\nverbs, adjectives, pronouns, and still more adverbs, prepositions, and\nconjunctions are more intimately connected with our thinking than are\nsubstantives.\"\nThe disease called Aphasia, of which a little was said in Chapter\nII, has let in a flood of light on the phenomenon of Memory, by\nshowing the number of ways in which the use of a given object, like a\nword, may be lost by the mind. We may lose our acoustic idea or our\narticulatory idea of it; neither without the other will give us proper\ncommand of the word. And if we have both, but have lost the paths of\nassociation between the brain-centres which support the two, we are\nin as bad a plight. 'Ataxic' and 'amnesic' aphasia, 'word-deafness,'\nand 'associative aphasia' are all practical losses of word-memory. We\nhave thus, as M. Ribot says, not memory so much as memories.[611] The\nvisual, the tactile, the muscular, the auditory memory may all vary\nindependently of each other in the same individual; and different\nindividuals may have them developed in different degrees. As a rule,\na man's memory is good in the departments in which his interest\nis strong; but those departments are apt to be those in which his\ndiscriminative sensibility is high. A man with a bad ear is not likely\nto have practically a good musical memory, or a purblind person to\nremember visual appearances well. In a later chapter we shall see\nillustrations of the differences in men's imagining power.[612] It\nis obvious that the machinery of memory must be largely determined\nthereby.\nMr. Galton, in his work on English Men of Science,[613] has given a\nvery interesting collation of cases showing individual variations in\nthe type of memory, where it is strong. Some have it verbal. Others\nhave it good for facts and figures, others for form. Most say that\nwhat is to be remembered must first be rationally conceived and\nassimilated.[614]\n*       *       *       *       *\nThere is an interesting fact connected with remembering, which, so\nfar as I know, Mr. R. Verdon was the first writer expressly to call\nattention to. We can _set_ our memory as it were to retain things for a\ncertain time, and then let them depart.\n\"Individuals often remember clearly and well up to the time when\nthey have to use their knowledge, and then, when it is no longer\nrequired, there follows a rapid and extensive decay of the traces.\nMany schoolboys forget their lessons after they have said them, many\nbarristers forget details got up for a particular case. Thus a boy\nlearns thirty lines of Homer, says them perfectly, and then forgets\nthem so that he could not say five consecutive lines the next morning,\nand a barrister may be one week learned in the mysteries of making\ncog-wheels, but in the next he may be well acquainted with the anatomy\nof the ribs instead.\"[615]\nThe rationale of this fact is obscure; and the existence of it ought to\nmake us feel how truly subtle are the nervous processes which memory\ninvolves. Mr. Verdon adds that\n\"When the use of a record is withdrawn, and attention withdrawn from\nit, and we think no more about it, we know that we experience a\nfeeling of relief, and we may thus conclude that energy is in some\nway liberated. If the ... attention is not withdrawn, so that we keep\nthe record in mind, we know that this feeling of relief does not take\nplace.... Also we are well aware, not only that after this feeling\nof relief takes place, the record does not seem so well conserved as\nbefore, but that we have real difficulty in attempting to remember it.\"\nThis shows that we are not as entirely unconscious of a topic as we\nthink, during the time in which we seem to be merely retaining it\nsubject to recall.\n\"Practically,\" says Mr. Verdon, \"we sometimes keep a matter in hand\nnot exactly by attending to it, but by keeping our attention referred\nto something connected with it from time to time. Translating this\ninto the language of physiology, we mean that by referring attention\nto a part within, or closely connected with, the system of traces\n[paths] required to be remembered, we keep it well fed, so that the\ntraces are preserved with the utmost delicacy.\"\nThis is perhaps as near as we can get to an explanation. Setting the\nmind to remember a thing involves a continual minimal irradiation\nof excitement into paths which lead thereto, involves the continued\npresence of the thing in the 'fringe' of our consciousness. Letting the\nthing go involves withdrawal of the irradiation, unconsciousness of the\nthing, and, after a time, obliteration of the paths.\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.]\nA curious peculiarity of our memory is that things are impressed better\nby active than by passive repetition. I mean that in learning by heart\n(for example), when we almost know the piece, it pays better to wait\nand recollect by an effort from within, than to look at the book again.\nIf we recover the words in the former way, we shall probably know them\nthe next time; if in the latter way, we shall very likely need the book\nonce more. The learning by heart means the formation of paths from a\nformer set to a later set of cerebral word-processes: call 1 and 2 in\nthe diagram the processes in question; then when we remember by inward\neffort, the path is formed by discharge from 1 to 2, just as it will\nafterwards be used. But when we excite 2 by the eye, although the path\n1--2 doubtless is then shot through also, the phenomenon which we are\ndiscussing shows that the direct discharge from 1 into 2, unaided by\nthe eyes, ploughs the deeper and more permanent groove. There is,\nmoreover, a greater amount of tension accumulated in the brain before\nthe discharge from 1 to 2, when the latter takes place unaided by the\neye. This is proved by the general feeling of strain in the effort to\nremember 2; and this also ought to make the discharge more violent\nand the path more deep. A similar reason doubtless accounts for the\nfamiliar fact that we remember our own theories, our own discoveries,\ncombinations, inventions, in short whatever 'ideas' originate in our\nown brain, a thousand times better than exactly similar things which\nare communicated to us from without.\nA word, in closing, about the metaphysics involved in remembering.\nAccording to the assumptions of this book, thoughts accompany the\nbrain's workings, and those thoughts are cognitive of realities.\nThe whole relation is one which we can only write down empirically,\nconfessing that no glimmer of explanation of it is yet in sight. That\nbrains should give rise to a knowing consciousness at all, this is the\none mystery which returns, no matter of what sort the consciousness\nand of what sort the knowledge may be. Sensations, aware of mere\nqualities, involve the mystery as much as thoughts, aware of complex\nsystems, involve it. To the platonizing tradition in philosophy,\nhowever, this is not so. Sensational consciousness is something\n_quasi-material_, hardly cognitive, which one need not much wonder\nat. _Relating_ consciousness is quite the reverse, and the mystery\nof it is unspeakable. Professor Ladd, for example, in his usually\nexcellent book,[616] after well showing the matter-of-fact dependence\nof retention and reproduction on brain-paths, says:\n\"In the study of perception psycho-physics _can_ do much towards a\nscientific explanation. It can tell what qualities of stimuli produce\ncertain qualities of sensations, it can suggest a principle relating\nthe quantity of the stimuli to the intensity of the sensation; it\ncan investigate the laws under which, by combined action of various\nexcitations, the _sensations are combined_ [?] into presentations\nof sense; it can show how the time-relations of the sensations and\npercepts in consciousness correspond to the objective relations in\ntime of the stimulations. But for that spiritual activity which\nactually _puts together_ in consciousness the sensations, it cannot\neven suggest the beginning of a physical explanation. Moreover, no\ncerebral process can be conceived of, which--in case it were known\nto exist--could possibly be regarded as a fitting basis for this\nunifying _actus_ of mind. Thus also, and even more emphatically, must\nwe insist upon the complete inability of physiology to suggest an\nexplanation for conscious memory, in so far as it is _memory_--that\nis, in so far as it most imperatively calls for explanation.... The\nvery essence of the act of memory consists in the ability to say:\nThis after-image is the image of a percept I had a moment since;\nor this image of memory is the image of the percept I had at a\ncertain time--I do not remember precisely how long since. It would,\nthen, be quite contrary to the facts to hold that, when an image of\nmemory appears in consciousness, it is recognized as belonging to a\nparticular original percept on account of its perceived resemblance\nto this percept. The original percept does not exist and will never\nbe _reproduced_. Even more palpably false and absurd would it be to\nhold that any similarity of the impressions or processes in end organs\nor central organs explains the act of conscious memory. Consciousness\nknows nothing of such similarity; knows nothing even of the existence\nof nervous impressions and processes. Moreover, we could never _know_\ntwo impressions or processes that are separated in time to be similar,\nwithout involving the same inexplicable act of memory. It is a fact\nof consciousness on which all possibility of connected experience and\nof recorded and cumulative human knowledge is dependent that certain\nphases or products of consciousness appear with a claim to stand for\n(to represent)[617] past experiences to which they are regarded as in\nsome respect similar. It is this peculiar claim in consciousness which\nconstitutes the essence of an act of memory; it is this which makes\nthe memory wholly inexplicable as a mere persistence or recurrence\nof similar impressions. It is this which makes conscious memory a\nspiritual phenomenon, the explanation of which, as arising out of\nnervous processes and conditions, is not simply undiscovered in fact,\nbut utterly incapable of approach by the imagination. When, then, we\nspeak of a physical basis of memory, recognition must be made of the\ncomplete inability of science to suggest any physical process which\ncan be conceived of as correlated with that peculiar and mysterious\n_actus_ of the mind, _connecting_ its present and its past, which\nconstitutes the essence of memory.\"\nThis passage seems to me characteristic of the reigning half-way\nmodes of thought. It puts the difficulties in the wrong places. At\none moment it seems to admit with the cruder sensationalists that the\nmaterial of our thoughts is independent sensations reproduced, and\nthat the 'putting together' of these sensations would be knowledge, if\nit could only be brought about, the only mystery being as to the what\n'_actus_' can bring it about. At another moment it seems to contend\nthat even this sort of 'combining' would not be knowledge, because\ncertain of the elements connected must 'claim to represent or stand\nfor' past originals, which is incompatible with their being mere images\nrevived. The result is various confused and scattered mysteries and\nunsatisfied intellectual desires. But why not 'pool' our mysteries\ninto one great mystery, the mystery that brain-processes occasion\nknowledge at all? It is surely no different mystery to _feel_ myself by\nmeans of one brain-process writing at this table now, and by means of\na different brain-process a year hence to _remember_ myself writing.\nAll that psychology can do is to seek to determine _what_ the several\nbrain-processes are; and this, in a wretchedly imperfect way, is what\nsuch writings as the present chapter have begun to do. But of 'images\nreproduced,' and 'claiming to represent,' and 'put together by a\nunifying _actus_,' I have been silent, because such expressions either\nsignify nothing, or they are only roundabout ways of simply saying that\nthe _past is known_ when certain brain-conditions are fulfilled, and it\nseems to me that the straightest and shortest way of saying that is the\nbest.\nFor a history of opinion about Memory, and other bibliographic\nreferences, I must refer to the admirable little monograph on the\nsubject by Mr. W. H. Burnham in the American Journal of Psychology,\nvols. i and ii. Useful books are: D. Kay's Memory, What It Is, and How\nto Improve It (1888); and F. Fauth's Das Ged\u00e4chtniss, Studie zu einer\nP\u00e4dagogik, etc., 1888.\nEND OF VOL. I.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[567] L'Homme et l'Intelligence, p. 32.\n[568] Professor Richet has therefore no right to say, as he does in\nanother place (Revue Philosophique, xxi, 570): \"_Without memory no\nconscious sensation, without memory no consciousness._\" All he is\nentitled to say is: \"Without memory no consciousness known outside\nof itself.\" Of the sort of consciousness that is an object for later\nstates, and becomes as it were permanent, he gives a good example:\n\"Who of us, alas! has not experienced a bitter and profound grief, the\nimmense laceration cause by the death of some cherished fellow-being?\nWell, in these great griefs the present endures neither for a minute,\nfor an hour, nor for a day, but for weeks and months. The memory of the\ncruel moment will not efface itself from consciousness. It disappears\nnot, but remains living, present, coexisting with the multitude of\nother sensations which are juxtaposed in consciousness alongside of\nthis one persistent emotion which is felt always in the present tense.\nA long time is needed ere we can attain to forgetting it, ere we can\nmake it enter into the past. _H\u00e6ret lateri letalis arundo._\" (_Ibid._\n583.)\n[569] This is the primary positive after-image. According to Helmholtz,\none third of a second is the most favorable length of exposure to the\nlight for producing it. Longer exposure, complicated by subsequent\nadmission of light to the eye, results in the ordinary negative and\ncomplementary after-images, with their changes, which may (if the\noriginal impression was brilliant and the fixation long) last for many\nminutes. Fechner gives the name of memory-after-images (Psychophysik,\nii, 492) to the instantaneous positive effects, and distinguishes\nthem from ordinary after images by the following characters: 1) Their\noriginals must have been _attended to_, only such parts of a compound\noriginal as have been attended to appearing. This is not the case in\ncommon visual after-images. 2) The strain of attention towards them\nis inward, as in ordinary remembering, not outward, as in observing a\ncommon after-image. 3) A short fixation of the original is better for\nthe memory-after-image, a long one for the ordinary after-image. 4) The\ncolors of the memory-after-image are never complementary of those of\nthe original.\n[570] Hermann's Hdbch. ii, 2. 282.\n[571] Rev. Philos., 562.\n[572] Richet says: \"The present has a certain duration, a variable\nduration, sometimes a rather long one, which comprehends all the time\noccupied by the after-reverberation [_retentissement_, after-image] of\na sensation. For example, if the reverberation of an electric shock\nwithin our nerves lasts ten minutes, for that electric shock there is\na present of ten minutes. On the other hand, a feebler sensation will\nhave a shorter present. But in every case, for a conscious sensation\n[I should say for a _remembered_ sensation] to occur, there must be a\npresent of a certain duration, of a few seconds at least.\" We have seen\nin the last chapter that it is hard to trace the backward limits of\nthis immediately intuited duration, or specious present. The figures\nwhich M. Richet supposes appear to be considerably too large.\n[573] Cf. Fechner, Psychophysik, ii, 499.\n[574] The primary after-image itself cannot be utilized if the stimulus\nis too brief. Mr. Cattell found (Psychologische Studien, iii, p. 93\nff.) that the color of a light must fall upon the eye for a period\nvarying from 0.00275 to 0.006 of a second, in order to be recognized\nfor what it is. Letters of the alphabet and familiar words require\nfrom 0.00075 to 0.00175 sec.--truly an interval extremely short. Some\nletters, E for example, are harder than others. In 1871 Helmholtz and\nBaxt had ascertained that when an impression was immediately followed\nby another, the latter quenched the former and prevented it from being\nknown to later consciousness. The first stimulus was letters of the\nalphabet, the second a bright white disk. \"With an interval of 0.0048\nsec. between the two excitations [I copy here the abstract in Ladd's\nPhysiological Psychology, p. 480], the disk appeared as scarcely a\ntrace of a weak shimmer; with an interval of 0.0096 sec., letters\nappeared in the shimmer--one or two which could be partially recognized\nwhen the interval increased to 0.0144 sec. When the interval was made\n0.0192 sec. the objects were a little more clearly discerned; at\n0.00336 sec. four letters could be well recognized; at 0.0432 sec.,\nfive letters; and at 0.0528 sec. all the letters could be read.\"\n(Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, iv, 325 ff.)\n[575] When the past is recalled symbolically, or conceptually only,\nit is true that no such copy need be there. In no sort of conceptual\nknowledge is it requisite that definitely resembling images be there\n(cf. pp. 471 ff.). But as all conceptual knowledge stands for intuitive\nknowledge, and terminates therein, I abstract from this complication,\nand confine myself to those memories in which the past is directly\nimaged in the mind, or, as we say, intuitively known.\n[576] E.g. Spencer, Psychology, i, p. 448. How do the believers in\nthe sufficiency of the 'image' formulate the cases where we remember\nthat something did _not_ happen\u2014-that we did not wind our watch, did\nnot lock the door, etc.? It is very hard to account for these memories\nof omission. The image of winding the watch is just as present to my\nmind now when I remember that I did not wind it as if I remembered\nthat I did. It must be a difference in the mode of feeling the image\nwhich leads me to such different conclusions in the two cases. When\nI remember that I did wind it, I feel it grown together with its\nassociates of past date and place. When I remember that I did not, it\nkeeps aloof; the associates fuse with each other, but not with it.\nThis sense of fusion, of the belonging together of things, is a most\nsubtle relation; the sense of non-fusion is an equally subtle one. Both\nrelations demand most complex mental processes to know them, processes\nquite different from that mere presence or absence of an image which\ndoes such service in the cruder books.\n[577] Psychologia Empirica, \u00a7 174.\n[578] Analysis, i, 330-1. Mill believed that the various things\nremembered, the self included, enter consciousness in the form of\nseparate ideas, but so rapidly that they are 'all clustered into one.'\n\"Ideas called up in close conjunction ... assume, even when there is\nthe greatest complexity, the appearance, not of many ideas, but of one\"\n(vol. i, p. 123). This mythology does not impair the accuracy of his\ndescription of memory's _object_.\n[579] Compare, however, p. 251, Chapter IX.\n[580] Professor Bain adds, in a note to this passage of Mill's: \"This\nprocess seems best expressed by laying down a law of Compound or\nComposite Association, under which a plurality of feeble links of\nconnection may be a substitute for one powerful and self-sufficing\nlink.\"\n[581] Analysis, chap. x.\n[582] H. Maudsley, The Physiology of Mind (London, 1876), p. 513.\n[583] The only fact which might plausibly be alleged against this view\nis the familiar one that we may feel the lapse of time in an experience\nso monotonous that its earlier portions can have no 'associates'\ndifferent from its later ones. Sit with closed eyes, for example,\nand steadily pronounce some vowel-sound, thus, _a-\u2014a\u2014-a-\u2014a-\u2014a\u2014-_ ...\nthinking only of the sound. Nothing changes during the time occupied by\nthe experiment, and yet at the end of it you know that its beginning\nwas far away. I think, however, that a close attention to what happens\nduring this experiment shows that it does not violate in the least the\nconditions of recall laid down in the text; and that if the moment\nto which we mentally hark back lie many seconds behind the present\ninstant, it always has different associates by which we define its\ndate. Thus it was when I had just breathed out, or in; or it was the\n'first moment' of the performance, the one 'preceded by silence;' or\nit was 'one very close to that;' or it was 'one when we were looking\nforward instead of back, as now;' or it is simply represented by a\nnumber and conceived symbolically with no definite image of its date.\nIt seems to me that I have no really intuitive discrimination of the\ndifferent past moments after the experience has gone on some little\ntime, but that back of the 'specious present' they all fuse into a\nsingle conception of the _kind of thing_ that has been going on, with\na more or less clear sense of the total time it has lasted, this\nlatter being based on an automatic counting of the successive pulses\nof thought by which the process is from moment to moment recognized\nas being always the same. Within the few seconds which constitute the\nspecious present there is an intuitive perception of the successive\nmoments. But these moments, of which we have a primary memory-image,\nare not properly _recalled_ from the past, our knowledge of them is in\nno way analogous to a memory properly so called. Cf. _supra_, p. 646.\n[584] On Intelligence, i, 258-9.\n[585] Not that _mere_ native tenacity will make a man great. It must\nbe coupled with great passions and great intellect besides. Imbeciles\nsometimes have extraordinary desultory memory. Drobisch describes\n(Empirische Psychol., p. 95) the case of a young man whom he examined.\nHe had with difficulty been taught to read and speak. \"But if two or\nthree minutes were allowed him to peruse an octavo page, he then could\nspell the single words out from his memory as well as if the book lay\nopen before him.... That there was no deception I could test by means\nof a new Latin law-dissertation which had just come into my hands,\nwhich he never could have seen, and of which both subject and language\nwere unknown to him. He read off [mentally] many lines, skipping about\ntoo, of the page which had been given him to see, no worse than if the\nexperiment had been made with a child's story.\" Drobisch describes\nthis case as if it were one of unusual persistence in the visual image\n['primary memory,' _vide supra_, p. 643]. But he adds that the youth\n'remembered his pages a long time.' In the Journal of Speculative\nPhilosophy for Jan. 1871 (vi, 6) is an account by Mr. W. D. Henkle\n(together with the stock classic examples of preternatural memory) of\nan almost blind Pennsylvania farmer who could remember the day of the\nweek on which any date had fallen for forty-two years past, and also\nthe kind of weather it was, and what he was doing on each of more than\nfifteen thousand days. Pity that such a magnificent faculty as this\ncould not have found more worthy application!\nWhat these cases show is that the mere organic retentiveness of a\nman need bear no definite relation to his other mental powers. Men\nof the highest general powers will often forget nothing, however\ninsignificant. One of the most generally accomplished men I know has a\nmemory of this sort. He never keeps written note of anything, yet is\nnever at a loss for a fact which he has once heard. He remembers the\nold addresses of all his New York friends, living in numbered streets,\naddresses which they themselves have long since moved away from and\nforgotten. He says that he should probably recognize an individual\nfly, if he had seen him thirty years previous--he is, by the way, an\nentomologist. As an instance of his desultory memory, he was introduced\nto a certain colonel at a club. The conversation fell upon the signs of\nage in man. The colonel challenged him to estimate his age. He looked\nat him, and gave the exact day of his birth, to the wonder of all.\nBut the secret of this accuracy was that, having picked up some days\npreviously an army-register, he had idly turned over its list of names,\nwith dates of birth, graduation, promotions, etc., attached, and when\nthe colonel's name was mentioned to him at the club, these figures, on\nwhich he had not bestowed a moment's thought, involuntarily surged up\nin his mind. Such a memory is of course a priceless boon.\n[586] Cf. Ebbinghaus: Ueber das Ged\u00e4chtniss (1885), pp. 67, 45. One\nmay hear a person say: \"I have a very poor memory, because I was never\nsystematically made to learn poetry at school.\"\n[587] How to Strengthen the Memory; or, The Natural and Scientific\nMethods of Never Forgetting.

Holbrook, M.D. New York (no date).\n[588] Page 39.\n[589] Op. cit. p. 100.\n[590] In order to test the opinion so confidently expressed in the\ntext, I have tried to see whether a certain amount of daily training\nin learning poetry by heart will shorten the time it takes to learn\nan entirely different kind of poetry. During eight successive days I\nlearned 158 lines of Victor Hugo's 'Satyr.' The total number of minutes\nrequired for this was 131 5/6--it should be said that I had learned\nnothing by heart for many years. I then, working for twenty-odd minutes\ndaily, learned the entire first book of Paradise Lost, occupying 38\ndays in the process. After this training I went back to Victor Hugo's\npoem, and found that 158 additional lines (divided exactly as on the\nformer occasion) took me 151 1/2 minutes. In other words, I committed\nmy Victor Hugo to memory before the training at the rate of a line in\n50 seconds, after the training at the rate of a line in 57 seconds,\njust the opposite result from that which the popular view would lead\none to expect. But as I was perceptibly fagged with other work at the\ntime of the second batch of Victor Hugo, I thought that might explain\nthe retardation; so I persuaded several other persons to repeat the\ntest.\nDr. W. H. Burnham learned 16 lines of In Memoriam for 8 days; time,\n14-17 minutes--daily average 14 3/4. He then trained himself on\nSchiller's translation of the second book of the \u00c6neid into German, 16\nlines daily for 26 consecutive days. On returning to the same quantity\nof In Memoriam again, he found his maximum time 20 minutes, minimum\n10, average 14 27/48. As he feared the outer conditions might not have\nbeen as favorable this time as the first, he waited a few days and got\nconditions as near as possible identical. The result was, minimum time\n8 minutes; maximum 19 1/2; average 14 3/48.\nMr. E. S. Drown tested himself on Virgil for 16 days, then again for 16\ndays, after training himself on Scott. Average time before training,\n13 minutes 26 seconds; after training, 12 minutes 16 seconds. [Sixteen\ndays is too long for the test, it gives time for training on the\ntest-verse.]\nMr. C. H. Baldwin took 10 lines for 15 days as his test, trained\nhimself on 450 lines 'of an entirely different verse,' and then took 15\ndays more of the former verse 10 lines a day. Average result: 3 minutes\n41 seconds before, 3 minutes 2 seconds after, training. [Same criticism\nas before.]\nMr. E. A. Pease tested himself on Idyls of the King, and trained\nhimself on Paradise Lost. Average result of 6 days each time: 14\nminutes 34 seconds before, 14 minutes 55 seconds after, training. Mr.\nBurnham having suggested that to eliminate facilitating effect entirely\nfrom the training verses one ought to test one's self _\u00e0 la_ Ebbinghaus\non series of nonsense-syllables, having no analogy whatever with any\nsystem of expressive verses, I induced two of my students to perform\nthat experiment also. The record is unfortunately lost; but the result\nwas a very considerable shortening of the average time of the second\nseries of nonsense-syllables, learned after training. This seems to\nme, however, more to show the effects of rapid habituation to the\nnonsense-verses themselves than those of the poetry used between them.\nBut I mean to prosecute the experiments farther, and will report in\nanother place.\nOne of my students having quoted a clergyman of his acquaintance\nwho had marvellously improved by practice his power of learning his\nsermons by heart, I wrote to the gentleman for corroboration. I append\nhis reply, which shows that the increased facility is due rather to\na change in his methods of learning than to his native retentiveness\nhaving grown by exercise: \"As for memory, mine has improved year by\nyear, except when in ill-health, like a gymnast's muscle. Before\ntwenty it took three or four days to commit an hour-long sermon; after\ntwenty, two days, one day, half a day, and now one slow analytic, very\nattentive or adhesive reading does it. But memory seems to me the most\nphysical of intellectual powers. Bodily ease and freshness have much to\ndo with it. Then there is a great difference of facility in method. I\nused to commit sentence by sentence. Now I take the idea of the whole,\nthen its leading divisions, then its subdivisions, then its sentences.\"\n[591] E. Pick: Memory and its Doctors (1888), p. 7.\n[592] This system is carried out in great detail in a book called\n'Memory Training,' by Wm. L. Evans (1889).\n[593] Paulhan, L'Activit\u00e9 mental, et les \u00c9l\u00e9ments de l'Esprit (1889).\np. 70.\n[594] On Intelligence, i, 77-82.\n[595] Psychology, \u00a7 201.\n[596] Professor H\u00f6ffding considers that the absence of contiguous\nassociates distinctly thought-of is a proof that associative processes\nare not concerned in these cases of instantaneous recognition where\nwe get a strong sense of familiarity with the object, but no recall\nof previous time or place. His theory of what happens is that the\nobject before us, A, comes with a sense of familiarity whenever it\nawakens _a slumbering image, a, of its own past self,_ whilst without\nthis image it seems unfamiliar. The _quality of familiarity_ is\ndue to the coalescence of the two similar processes A + _a_ in the\nbrain (Psychologie, p. 188; Vierteljsch. f. wiss. Phil., xiii, 432\n[1889]). This explanation is a very tempting one where the phenomenon\nof recognition is reduced to its simplest terms. Experiments have\nbeen performed in Wundt's laboratory by Messrs. Wolfe, see below, p.\n679, and Lehmann (Philosophische Studien, v, 96), in which a person\nhad to tell out of several closely resembling sensible impressions\n(sounds, tints of color) presented, which of them was the same with\none presented a moment before. And it does seem here as if the fading\nprocess in the just-excited tract must combine with the process of\nthe new impression to give to the latter a peculiar subjective tinge\nwhich should separate it from the impressions which the other objects\ngive. But recognition of this immediate sort is beyond our power after\na very short time has intervened. A couple of minutes' interval is\ngenerally fatal to it; so that it is impossible to conceive that our\nfrequent instantaneous recognition of a face, e.g., as having been met\nbefore, takes place by any such simple process. Where we associate\na _head of classification_ with the object, the time-interval has\nmuch less effect. Dr. Lehmann could identify shades of gray much more\nsuccessfully and permanently after mentally attaching names or numbers\nto them. Here it is the recall of the contiguous associate, the number\nor name, which brings about the recognition. Where an experience is\ncomplex, each element of the total object has had the other elements\nfor its past contiguous associates. Each element thus tends to revive\nthe other elements from within, at the same time that the outward\nobject is making them revive from without. We have thus, whenever we\nmeet a familiar object, that sense of _expectation gratified_ which\nis so large a factor in our \u00e6sthetic emotions; and even were there\nno 'fringe of tendency' toward the arousal of _extrinsic_ associates\n(which there certainly always is), still this _intrinsic_ play of\nmutual association among the parts would give a character of ease\nto familiar percepts which would make of them a distinct subjective\nclass. A process fills its old bed in a different way from that in\nwhich it makes a new bed. One can appeal to introspection for proof.\nWhen, for example, I go into a slaughter-house into which I once went\nyears ago, and the horrid din of the screaming hogs strikes me with\nthe overpowering sense of identification, when the blood-stained face\nof the 'sticker,' whom I had long ceased to think of, is immediately\nrecognized as the face that struck me so before; when the dingy and\nreddened woodwork, the purple-flowing floor, the smell, the emotion\nof disgust, and _all_ the details, in a word, forthwith re-establish\nthemeelves as familiar occupants of my mind; the _extraneous_\nassociates of the past time are anything but prominent. Again, in\ntrying to think of an engraving, say the portrait of Rajah Brooke\nprefixed to his biography, I can do so only partially; but when I\ntake down the book and, looking at the actual face, am smitten with\nthe intimate sense of its sameness with the one I was striving to\nresuscitate,--where in the experience is the element of _extrinsic_\nassociation? In both these cases it surely _feels_ as if the moment\nwhen the sense of recall is most vivid were also the moment when all\n_extraneous_ associates were most suppressed. The butcher's face\nrecalls the former walls of the shambles; their thought recalls the\ngroaning beasts, and they the face again, just as I now experience\nthem, with no different past ingredient. In like manner the peculiar\ndeepening of my consciousness of the Rajah's physiognomy at the moment\nwhen I open the book and say \"Ah! that's the very face!\" is so intense\nas to banish from my mind all collateral circumstances, whether of the\npresent or of former experiences. But here it is the nose preparing\ntracts for the eye, the eye preparing them for the mouth, the mouth\npreparing them for the nose again, all these processes involving paths\nof contiguous association, as defended in the text. I cannot agree,\ntherefore, with Prof. H\u00f6ffding, in spite of my respect for him as a\npsychologist, that the phenomenon of instantaneous recognition is only\nexplicable through the recall and comparison of the thing with its\nown past image. Nor can I see in the facts in question any additional\nground for reinstating the general notion which we have already\nrejected (_supra_, p. 592) that a 'sensation' is ever received into the\nmind by an 'image' of its own past self. It is received by contiguous\nassociates; or if they form too faint a fringe, its neural currents run\ninto a bed which is still 'warm' from just-previous currents, and which\nconsequently feel different from currents whose bed is cold. I agree,\nhowever, with H\u00f6ffding that Dr. Lehmann's experiments (many of them)\ndo not seem to prove the point which he seeks to establish. Lehmann,\nindeed, seems himself to believe that we recognize a sensation A by\ncomparing it with its own past image \u03b1 (_loc. cit._ p. 114), in which\nopinion I altogether fail to concur.\n[597] Duality of the Mind, p. 84. The same thesis is defended by the\nlate Mr. R. H. Proctor, who gives some cases rather hard to reconcile\nwith my own proposed explanation, in 'Knowledge' for Nov. 8, 1884. See\nalso Ribot, Maladies de la M\u00e9moire, p. 149 ff.\n[598] Zeitschr. f.

In the chapter on Perception we shall have\ninnumerable examples of it. A good pathological illustration of it is\ngiven in the curious observations of M. Binet on certain hysterical\nsubjects, with an\u00e6sthetic hands, who saw what was done with their hands\nas an independent vision but did not feel it. The hand being hidden\nby a screen, the patient was ordered to look at another screen and to\ntell of any visual image which might project itself thereon. Numbers\nwould then come, corresponding to the number of times the insensible\nmember was raised, touched, etc. Colored lines and figures would come,\ncorresponding to similar ones traced on the palm; the hand itself, or\nits fingers, would come when manipulated; and, finally, objects placed\nin it would come; but on the hand itself nothing could ever be felt.\nThe whole phenomenon shows how an idea which remains itself below\nthe threshold of a certain conscious self may occasion associative\neffects therein. The skin-sensations, unfelt by the patient's primary\nconsciousness, awaken, nevertheless, their usual visual associates\ntherein.\n[603] I copy from the abstract of Wolfe's paper in 'Science' for Nov.\n19, 1886.

{"text": "PRAGMATISM\nA New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking\nBy William James\nTo the Memory of John Stuart Mill\nfrom whom I first learned the pragmatic openness of mind and whom my\nfancy likes to picture as our leader were he alive to-day.\nPreface\nThe lectures that follow were delivered at the Lowell Institute in\nBoston in November and December, 1906, and in January, 1907, at\nColumbia University, in New York. They are printed as delivered, without\ndevelopments or notes. The pragmatic movement, so-called--I do not like\nthe name, but apparently it is too late to change it--seems to have\nrather suddenly precipitated itself out of the air. A number of\ntendencies that have always existed in philosophy have all at once\nbecome conscious of themselves collectively, and of their combined\nmission; and this has occurred in so many countries, and from so many\ndifferent points of view, that much unconcerted statement has resulted.\nI have sought to unify the picture as it presents itself to my own eyes,\ndealing in broad strokes, and avoiding minute controversy. Much futile\ncontroversy might have been avoided, I believe, if our critics had been\nwilling to wait until we got our message fairly out.\nIf my lectures interest any reader in the general subject, he will\ndoubtless wish to read farther. I therefore give him a few references.\nIn America, John Dewey's 'Studies in Logical Theory' are the foundation.\nRead also by Dewey the articles in the Philosophical Review, vol.\nxv, pp. 113 and 465, in Mind, vol. xv, p. 293, and in the Journal of\nPhilosophy, vol. iv, p. 197.\nProbably the best statements to begin with however, are F. C. S.\nSchiller's in his 'Studies in Humanism,' especially the essays numbered\ni, v, vi, vii, xviii and xix. His previous essays and in general\nthe polemic literature of the subject are fully referred to in his\nfootnotes.\nFurthermore, see G. Milhaud: le Rationnel, 1898, and the fine articles\nby Le Roy in the Revue de Metaphysique, vols. 7, 8 and 9. Also articles\nby Blondel and de Sailly in the Annales de Philosophie Chretienne, 4me\nSerie, vols. 2 and 3. Papini announces a book on Pragmatism, in the\nFrench language, to be published very soon.\nTo avoid one misunderstanding at least, let me say that there is no\nlogical connexion between pragmatism, as I understand it, and a doctrine\nwhich I have recently set forth as 'radical empiricism.' The latter\nstands on its own feet. One may entirely reject it and still be a\npragmatist.\nHarvard University, April, 1907.\nContents\nLecture I\nThe Present Dilemma in Philosophy\nChesterton quoted. Everyone has a philosophy. Temperament is a factor in\nall philosophizing. Rationalists and empiricists. The tender-minded\nand the tough-minded. Most men wish both facts and religion. Empiricism\ngives facts without religion. Rationalism gives religion without facts.\nThe layman's dilemma. The unreality in rationalistic systems. Leibnitz\non the damned, as an example. M. I. Swift on the optimism of idealists.\nPragmatism as a mediating system. An objection. Reply: philosophies have\ncharacters like men, and are liable to as summary judgments. Spencer as\nan example.\nLecture II\nWhat Pragmatism Means\nThe squirrel. Pragmatism as a method. History of the method. Its\ncharacter and affinities. How it contrasts with rationalism and\nintellectualism. A 'corridor theory.' Pragmatism as a theory of truth,\nequivalent to 'humanism.' Earlier views of mathematical, logical, and\nnatural truth. More recent views. Schiller's and Dewey's 'instrumental'\nview. The formation of new beliefs. Older truth always has to be kept\naccount of. Older truth arose similarly. The 'humanistic' doctrine.\nRationalistic criticisms of it. Pragmatism as mediator between\nempiricism and religion. Barrenness of transcendental idealism. How far\nthe concept of the Absolute must be called true. The true is the good\nin the way of belief. The clash of truths. Pragmatism unstiffens\ndiscussion.\nLecture III\nSome Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered\nThe problem of substance. The Eucharist. Berkeley's pragmatic treatment\nof material substance. Locke's of personal identity. The problem of\nmaterialism. Rationalistic treatment of it. Pragmatic treatment. 'God'\nis no better than 'Matter' as a principle, unless he promise more.\nPragmatic comparison of the two principles. The problem of design.\n'Design' per se is barren. The question is WHAT design. The problem of\n'free-will.' Its relations to 'accountability.' Free-will a cosmological\ntheory. The pragmatic issue at stake in all these problems is what do\nthe alternatives PROMISE.\nLecture IV\nThe One and the Many\nTotal reflection. Philosophy seeks not only unity, but totality.\nRationalistic feeling about unity. Pragmatically considered, the world\nis one in many ways. One time and space. One subject of discourse. Its\nparts interact. Its oneness and manyness are co-ordinate. Question of\none origin. Generic oneness. One purpose. One story. One knower. Value\nof pragmatic method. Absolute monism. Vivekananda. Various types of\nunion discussed. Conclusion: We must oppose monistic dogmatism and\nfollow empirical findings.\nLecture V\nPragmatism and Common Sense\nNoetic pluralism. How our knowledge grows. Earlier ways of thinking\nremain. Prehistoric ancestors DISCOVERED the common sense concepts. List\nof them. They came gradually into use. Space and time. 'Things.' Kinds.\n'Cause' and 'law.' Common sense one stage in mental evolution, due\nto geniuses. The 'critical' stages: 1) scientific and 2) philosophic,\ncompared with common sense. Impossible to say which is the more 'true.'\nLecture VI\nPragmatism's Conception of Truth\nThe polemic situation. What does agreement with reality mean? It means\nverifiability. Verifiability means ability to guide us prosperously\nthrough experience. Completed verifications seldom needful. 'Eternal'\ntruths. Consistency, with language, with previous truths. Rationalist\nobjections. Truth is a good, like health, wealth, etc. It is expedient\nthinking. The past. Truth grows. Rationalist objections. Reply to them.\nLecture VII\nPragmatism and Humanism\nThe notion of THE Truth. Schiller on 'Humanism.' Three sorts of\nreality of which any new truth must take account. To 'take account' is\nambiguous. Absolutely independent reality is hard to find. The human\ncontribution is ubiquitous and builds out the given. Essence of\npragmatism's contrast with rationalism. Rationalism affirms a\ntransempirical world. Motives for this. Tough-mindedness rejects them. A\ngenuine alternative. Pragmatism mediates.\nLecture VIII\nPragmatism and Religion\nUtility of the Absolute. Whitman's poem 'To You.' Two ways of taking\nit. My friend's letter. Necessities versus possibilities. 'Possibility'\ndefined. Three views of the world's salvation. Pragmatism is\nmelioristic. We may create reality. Why should anything BE? Supposed\nchoice before creation. The healthy and the morbid reply. The 'tender'\nand the 'tough' types of religion. Pragmatism mediates.\nPRAGMATISM\nLecture I\nThe Present Dilemma in Philosophy\nIn the preface to that admirable collection of essays of his called\n'Heretics,' Mr. Chesterton writes these words: \"There are some\npeople--and I am one of them--who think that the most practical and\nimportant thing about a man is still his view of the universe. We think\nthat for a landlady considering a lodger, it is important to know his\nincome, but still more important to know his philosophy. We think that\nfor a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to know\nthe enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's\nphilosophy. We think the question is not whether the theory of the\ncosmos affects matters, but whether, in the long run, anything else\naffects them.\"\nI think with Mr. Chesterton in this matter. I know that you, ladies and\ngentlemen, have a philosophy, each and all of you, and that the most\ninteresting and important thing about you is the way in which it\ndetermines the perspective in your several worlds. You know the same\nof me. And yet I confess to a certain tremor at the audacity of the\nenterprise which I am about to begin. For the philosophy which is so\nimportant in each of us is not a technical matter; it is our more or\nless dumb sense of what life honestly and deeply means. It is only\npartly got from books; it is our individual way of just seeing and\nfeeling the total push and pressure of the cosmos. I have no right to\nassume that many of you are students of the cosmos in the class-room\nsense, yet here I stand desirous of interesting you in a philosophy\nwhich to no small extent has to be technically treated. I wish to fill\nyou with sympathy with a contemporaneous tendency in which I profoundly\nbelieve, and yet I have to talk like a professor to you who are not\nstudents. Whatever universe a professor believes in must at any rate be\na universe that lends itself to lengthy discourse. A universe definable\nin two sentences is something for which the professorial intellect has\nno use. No faith in anything of that cheap kind! I have heard friends\nand colleagues try to popularize philosophy in this very hall, but they\nsoon grew dry, and then technical, and the results were only partially\nencouraging. So my enterprise is a bold one. The founder of pragmatism\nhimself recently gave a course of lectures at the Lowell Institute with\nthat very word in its title-flashes of brilliant light relieved\nagainst Cimmerian darkness! None of us, I fancy, understood ALL that he\nsaid--yet here I stand, making a very similar venture.\nI risk it because the very lectures I speak of DREW--they brought good\naudiences. There is, it must be confessed, a curious fascination in\nhearing deep things talked about, even tho neither we nor the disputants\nunderstand them. We get the problematic thrill, we feel the presence of\nthe vastness. Let a controversy begin in a smoking-room anywhere, about\nfree-will or God's omniscience, or good and evil, and see how everyone\nin the place pricks up his ears. Philosophy's results concern us all\nmost vitally, and philosophy's queerest arguments tickle agreeably our\nsense of subtlety and ingenuity.\nBelieving in philosophy myself devoutly, and believing also that a kind\nof new dawn is breaking upon us philosophers, I feel impelled, per fas\naut nefas, to try to impart to you some news of the situation.\nPhilosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human\npursuits. It works in the minutest crannies and it opens out the widest\nvistas. It 'bakes no bread,' as has been said, but it can inspire our\nsouls with courage; and repugnant as its manners, its doubting and\nchallenging, its quibbling and dialectics, often are to common people,\nno one of us can get along without the far-flashing beams of light it\nsends over the world's perspectives. These illuminations at least, and\nthe contrast-effects of darkness and mystery that accompany them, give\nto what it says an interest that is much more than professional.\nThe history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash\nof human temperaments. Undignified as such a treatment may seem to some\nof my colleagues, I shall have to take account of this clash and explain\na good many of the divergencies of philosophers by it. Of whatever\ntemperament a professional philosopher is, he tries when philosophizing\nto sink the fact of his temperament. Temperament is no conventionally\nrecognized reason, so he urges impersonal reasons only for his\nconclusions. Yet his temperament really gives him a stronger bias than\nany of his more strictly objective premises. It loads the evidence\nfor him one way or the other, making for a more sentimental or a more\nhard-hearted view of the universe, just as this fact or that principle\nwould. He trusts his temperament. Wanting a universe that suits it, he\nbelieves in any representation of the universe that does suit it.\nHe feels men of opposite temper to be out of key with the world's\ncharacter, and in his heart considers them incompetent and 'not in\nit,' in the philosophic business, even tho they may far excel him in\ndialectical ability.\nYet in the forum he can make no claim, on the bare ground of his\ntemperament, to superior discernment or authority. There arises thus a\ncertain insincerity in our philosophic discussions: the potentest of\nall our premises is never mentioned. I am sure it would contribute to\nclearness if in these lectures we should break this rule and mention it,\nand I accordingly feel free to do so.\nOf course I am talking here of very positively marked men, men\nof radical idiosyncracy, who have set their stamp and likeness on\nphilosophy and figure in its history. Plato, Locke, Hegel, Spencer,\nare such temperamental thinkers. Most of us have, of course, no\nvery definite intellectual temperament, we are a mixture of opposite\ningredients, each one present very moderately. We hardly know our own\npreferences in abstract matters; some of us are easily talked out of\nthem, and end by following the fashion or taking up with the beliefs of\nthe most impressive philosopher in our neighborhood, whoever he may be.\nBut the one thing that has COUNTED so far in philosophy is that a man\nshould see things, see them straight in his own peculiar way, and be\ndissatisfied with any opposite way of seeing them. There is no reason\nto suppose that this strong temperamental vision is from now onward to\ncount no longer in the history of man's beliefs.\nNow the particular difference of temperament that I have in mind\nin making these remarks is one that has counted in literature, art,\ngovernment and manners as well as in philosophy. In manners we find\nformalists and free-and-easy persons. In government, authoritarians and\nanarchists. In literature, purists or academicals, and realists. In art,\nclassics and romantics. You recognize these contrasts as familiar; well,\nin philosophy we have a very similar contrast expressed in the pair of\nterms 'rationalist' and 'empiricist,' 'empiricist' meaning your lover of\nfacts in all their crude variety, 'rationalist' meaning your devotee to\nabstract and eternal principles. No one can live an hour without both\nfacts and principles, so it is a difference rather of emphasis; yet it\nbreeds antipathies of the most pungent character between those who\nlay the emphasis differently; and we shall find it extraordinarily\nconvenient to express a certain contrast in men's ways of taking their\nuniverse, by talking of the 'empiricist' and of the 'rationalist'\ntemper. These terms make the contrast simple and massive.\nMore simple and massive than are usually the men of whom the terms are\npredicated. For every sort of permutation and combination is possible in\nhuman nature; and if I now proceed to define more fully what I have in\nmind when I speak of rationalists and empiricists, by adding to each\nof those titles some secondary qualifying characteristics, I beg you to\nregard my conduct as to a certain extent arbitrary. I select types\nof combination that nature offers very frequently, but by no means\nuniformly, and I select them solely for their convenience in helping\nme to my ulterior purpose of characterizing pragmatism. Historically we\nfind the terms 'intellectualism' and 'sensationalism' used as synonyms\nof 'rationalism' and 'empiricism.' Well, nature seems to combine most\nfrequently with intellectualism an idealistic and optimistic tendency.\nEmpiricists on the other hand are not uncommonly materialistic, and\ntheir optimism is apt to be decidedly conditional and tremulous.\nRationalism is always monistic. It starts from wholes and universals,\nand makes much of the unity of things. Empiricism starts from the parts,\nand makes of the whole a collection-is not averse therefore to calling\nitself pluralistic. Rationalism usually considers itself more religious\nthan empiricism, but there is much to say about this claim, so I merely\nmention it. It is a true claim when the individual rationalist is what\nis called a man of feeling, and when the individual empiricist prides\nhimself on being hard-headed. In that case the rationalist will usually\nalso be in favor of what is called free-will, and the empiricist will\nbe a fatalist--I use the terms most popularly current. The rationalist\nfinally will be of dogmatic temper in his affirmations, while the\nempiricist may be more sceptical and open to discussion.\nI will write these traits down in two columns. I think you will\npractically recognize the two types of mental make-up that I mean if\nI head the columns by the titles 'tender-minded' and 'tough-minded'\nrespectively.\nTHE TENDER-MINDED\nRationalistic (going by 'principles'), Intellectualistic, Idealistic,\nOptimistic, Religious, Free-willist, Monistic, Dogmatical.\nTHE TOUGH-MINDED\nEmpiricist (going by 'facts'), Sensationalistic, Materialistic,\nPessimistic, Irreligious, Fatalistic, Pluralistic, Sceptical.\nPray postpone for a moment the question whether the two contrasted\nmixtures which I have written down are each inwardly coherent and\nself-consistent or not--I shall very soon have a good deal to say on\nthat point. It suffices for our immediate purpose that tender-minded and\ntough-minded people, characterized as I have written them down, do both\nexist. Each of you probably knows some well-marked example of each type,\nand you know what each example thinks of the example on the other side\nof the line. They have a low opinion of each other. Their antagonism,\nwhenever as individuals their temperaments have been intense, has formed\nin all ages a part of the philosophic atmosphere of the time. It forms a\npart of the philosophic atmosphere to-day. The tough think of the tender\nas sentimentalists and soft-heads. The tender feel the tough to be\nunrefined, callous, or brutal. Their mutual reaction is very much like\nthat that takes place when Bostonian tourists mingle with a population\nlike that of Cripple Creek. Each type believes the other to be inferior\nto itself; but disdain in the one case is mingled with amusement, in the\nother it has a dash of fear.\nNow, as I have already insisted, few of us are tender-foot Bostonians\npure and simple, and few are typical Rocky Mountain toughs, in\nphilosophy. Most of us have a hankering for the good things on both\nsides of the line. Facts are good, of course--give us lots of facts.\nPrinciples are good--give us plenty of principles. The world is\nindubitably one if you look at it in one way, but as indubitably is\nit many, if you look at it in another. It is both one and many--let us\nadopt a sort of pluralistic monism. Everything of course is necessarily\ndetermined, and yet of course our wills are free: a sort of free-will\ndeterminism is the true philosophy. The evil of the parts is undeniable;\nbut the whole can't be evil: so practical pessimism may be combined with\nmetaphysical optimism. And so forth--your ordinary philosophic layman\nnever being a radical, never straightening out his system, but living\nvaguely in one plausible compartment of it or another to suit the\ntemptations of successive hours.\nBut some of us are more than mere laymen in philosophy. We are worthy\nof the name of amateur athletes, and are vexed by too much inconsistency\nand vacillation in our creed. We cannot preserve a good intellectual\nconscience so long as we keep mixing incompatibles from opposite sides\nof the line.\nAnd now I come to the first positively important point which I wish to\nmake. Never were as many men of a decidedly empiricist proclivity in\nexistence as there are at the present day. Our children, one may say,\nare almost born scientific. But our esteem for facts has not neutralized\nin us all religiousness. It is itself almost religious. Our scientific\ntemper is devout. Now take a man of this type, and let him be also a\nphilosophic amateur, unwilling to mix a hodge-podge system after the\nfashion of a common layman, and what does he find his situation to be,\nin this blessed year of our Lord 1906? He wants facts; he wants\nscience; but he also wants a religion. And being an amateur and not an\nindependent originator in philosophy he naturally looks for guidance to\nthe experts and professionals whom he finds already in the field. A\nvery large number of you here present, possibly a majority of you, are\namateurs of just this sort.\nNow what kinds of philosophy do you find actually offered to meet your\nneed? You find an empirical philosophy that is not religious enough, and\na religious philosophy that is not empirical enough for your purpose.\nIf you look to the quarter where facts are most considered you find\nthe whole tough-minded program in operation, and the 'conflict between\nscience and religion' in full blast. Either it is that Rocky Mountain\ntough of a Haeckel with his materialistic monism, his ether-god and his\njest at your God as a 'gaseous vertebrate'; or it is Spencer treating\nthe world's history as a redistribution of matter and motion solely, and\nbowing religion politely out at the front door:--she may indeed continue\nto exist, but she must never show her face inside the temple. For a\nhundred and fifty years past the progress of science has seemed to mean\nthe enlargement of the material universe and the diminution of man's\nimportance. The result is what one may call the growth of naturalistic\nor positivistic feeling. Man is no law-giver to nature, he is an\nabsorber. She it is who stands firm; he it is who must accommodate\nhimself. Let him record truth, inhuman tho it be, and submit to it! The\nromantic spontaneity and courage are gone, the vision is materialistic\nand depressing. Ideals appear as inert by-products of physiology; what\nis higher is explained by what is lower and treated forever as a case of\n'nothing but'--nothing but something else of a quite inferior sort. You\nget, in short, a materialistic universe, in which only the tough-minded\nfind themselves congenially at home.\nIf now, on the other hand, you turn to the religious quarter for\nconsolation, and take counsel of the tender-minded philosophies, what do\nyou find?\nReligious philosophy in our day and generation is, among us\nEnglish-reading people, of two main types. One of these is more radical\nand aggressive, the other has more the air of fighting a slow retreat.\nBy the more radical wing of religious philosophy I mean the so-called\ntranscendental idealism of the Anglo-Hegelian school, the philosophy of\nsuch men as Green, the Cairds, Bosanquet, and Royce. This philosophy has\ngreatly influenced the more studious members of our protestant ministry.\nIt is pantheistic, and undoubtedly it has already blunted the edge of\nthe traditional theism in protestantism at large.\nThat theism remains, however. It is the lineal descendant, through one\nstage of concession after another, of the dogmatic scholastic theism\nstill taught rigorously in the seminaries of the catholic church. For a\nlong time it used to be called among us the philosophy of the Scottish\nschool. It is what I meant by the philosophy that has the air of\nfighting a slow retreat. Between the encroachments of the hegelians and\nother philosophers of the 'Absolute,' on the one hand, and those of the\nscientific evolutionists and agnostics, on the other, the men that\ngive us this kind of a philosophy, James Martineau, Professor Bowne,\nProfessor Ladd and others, must feel themselves rather tightly squeezed.\nFair-minded and candid as you like, this philosophy is not radical\nin temper. It is eclectic, a thing of compromises, that seeks a modus\nvivendi above all things. It accepts the facts of darwinism, the facts\nof cerebral physiology, but it does nothing active or enthusiastic with\nthem. It lacks the victorious and aggressive note. It lacks prestige in\nconsequence; whereas absolutism has a certain prestige due to the more\nradical style of it.\nThese two systems are what you have to choose between if you turn to the\ntender-minded school. And if you are the lovers of facts I have\nsupposed you to be, you find the trail of the serpent of rationalism, of\nintellectualism, over everything that lies on that side of the line. You\nescape indeed the materialism that goes with the reigning empiricism;\nbut you pay for your escape by losing contact with the concrete parts\nof life. The more absolutistic philosophers dwell on so high a level\nof abstraction that they never even try to come down. The absolute mind\nwhich they offer us, the mind that makes our universe by thinking it,\nmight, for aught they show us to the contrary, have made any one of a\nmillion other universes just as well as this. You can deduce no single\nactual particular from the notion of it. It is compatible with any state\nof things whatever being true here below. And the theistic God is almost\nas sterile a principle. You have to go to the world which he has created\nto get any inkling of his actual character: he is the kind of god that\nhas once for all made that kind of a world. The God of the theistic\nwriters lives on as purely abstract heights as does the Absolute.\nAbsolutism has a certain sweep and dash about it, while the usual theism\nis more insipid, but both are equally remote and vacuous. What you want\nis a philosophy that will not only exercise your powers of intellectual\nabstraction, but that will make some positive connexion with this actual\nworld of finite human lives.\nYou want a system that will combine both things, the scientific\nloyalty to facts and willingness to take account of them, the spirit of\nadaptation and accommodation, in short, but also the old confidence in\nhuman values and the resultant spontaneity, whether of the religious or\nof the romantic type. And this is then your dilemma: you find the two\nparts of your quaesitum hopelessly separated. You find empiricism with\ninhumanism and irreligion; or else you find a rationalistic philosophy\nthat indeed may call itself religious, but that keeps out of all\ndefinite touch with concrete facts and joys and sorrows.\nI am not sure how many of you live close enough to philosophy to realize\nfully what I mean by this last reproach, so I will dwell a little longer\non that unreality in all rationalistic systems by which your serious\nbeliever in facts is so apt to feel repelled.\nI wish that I had saved the first couple of pages of a thesis which\na student handed me a year or two ago. They illustrated my point so\nclearly that I am sorry I cannot read them to you now. This young man,\nwho was a graduate of some Western college, began by saying that he had\nalways taken for granted that when you entered a philosophic class-room\nyou had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one\nyou left behind you in the street. The two were supposed, he said, to\nhave so little to do with each other, that you could not possibly occupy\nyour mind with them at the same time. The world of concrete personal\nexperiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond\nimagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which\nyour philosophy-professor introduces you is simple, clean and noble.\nThe contradictions of real life are absent from it. Its architecture is\nclassic. Principles of reason trace its outlines, logical necessities\ncement its parts. Purity and dignity are what it most expresses. It is a\nkind of marble temple shining on a hill.\nIn point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than\na clear addition built upon it, a classic sanctuary in which the\nrationalist fancy may take refuge from the intolerably confused and\ngothic character which mere facts present. It is no EXPLANATION of our\nconcrete universe, it is another thing altogether, a substitute for it,\na remedy, a way of escape.\nIts temperament, if I may use the word temperament here, is utterly\nalien to the temperament of existence in the concrete. REFINEMENT is\nwhat characterizes our intellectualist philosophies. They exquisitely\nsatisfy that craving for a refined object of contemplation which is so\npowerful an appetite of the mind. But I ask you in all seriousness to\nlook abroad on this colossal universe of concrete facts, on their awful\nbewilderments, their surprises and cruelties, on the wildness which\nthey show, and then to tell me whether 'refined' is the one inevitable\ndescriptive adjective that springs to your lips.\nRefinement has its place in things, true enough. But a philosophy that\nbreathes out nothing but refinement will never satisfy the empiricist\ntemper of mind. It will seem rather a monument of artificiality. So we\nfind men of science preferring to turn their backs on metaphysics as on\nsomething altogether cloistered and spectral, and practical men shaking\nphilosophy's dust off their feet and following the call of the wild.\nTruly there is something a little ghastly in the satisfaction with which\na pure but unreal system will fill a rationalist mind. Leibnitz was\na rationalist mind, with infinitely more interest in facts than\nmost rationalist minds can show. Yet if you wish for superficiality\nincarnate, you have only to read that charmingly written 'Theodicee' of\nhis, in which he sought to justify the ways of God to man, and to prove\nthat the world we live in is the best of possible worlds. Let me quote a\nspecimen of what I mean.\nAmong other obstacles to his optimistic philosophy, it falls to Leibnitz\nto consider the number of the eternally damned. That it is infinitely\ngreater, in our human case, than that of those saved he assumes as a\npremise from the theologians, and then proceeds to argue in this way.\nEven then, he says:\n\"The evil will appear as almost nothing in comparison with the good, if\nwe once consider the real magnitude of the City of God. Coelius Secundus\nCurio has written a little book, 'De Amplitudine Regni Coelestis,' which\nwas reprinted not long ago. But he failed to compass the extent of the\nkingdom of the heavens. The ancients had small ideas of the works of\nGod. ... It seemed to them that only our earth had inhabitants, and even\nthe notion of our antipodes gave them pause. The rest of the world for\nthem consisted of some shining globes and a few crystalline spheres.\nBut to-day, whatever be the limits that we may grant or refuse to the\nUniverse we must recognize in it a countless number of globes, as big\nas ours or bigger, which have just as much right as it has to support\nrational inhabitants, tho it does not follow that these need all be men.\nOur earth is only one among the six principal satellites of our sun. As\nall the fixed stars are suns, one sees how small a place among visible\nthings our earth takes up, since it is only a satellite of one among\nthem. Now all these suns MAY be inhabited by none but happy creatures;\nand nothing obliges us to believe that the number of damned persons is\nvery great; for a VERY FEW INSTANCES AND SAMPLES SUFFICE FOR THE UTILITY\nWHICH GOOD DRAWS FROM EVIL. Moreover, since there is no reason to\nsuppose that there are stars everywhere, may there not be a great space\nbeyond the region of the stars? And this immense space, surrounding all\nthis region, ... may be replete with happiness and glory. ... What now\nbecomes of the consideration of our Earth and of its denizens? Does it\nnot dwindle to something incomparably less than a physical point, since\nour Earth is but a point compared with the distance of the fixed stars.\nThus the part of the Universe which we know, being almost lost in\nnothingness compared with that which is unknown to us, but which we\nare yet obliged to admit; and all the evils that we know lying in this\nalmost-nothing; it follows that the evils may be almost-nothing in\ncomparison with the goods that the Universe contains.\"\nLeibnitz continues elsewhere: \"There is a kind of justice which aims\nneither at the amendment of the criminal, nor at furnishing an example\nto others, nor at the reparation of the injury. This justice is founded\nin pure fitness, which finds a certain satisfaction in the expiation\nof a wicked deed. The Socinians and Hobbes objected to this punitive\njustice, which is properly vindictive justice and which God has reserved\nfor himself at many junctures. ... It is always founded in the fitness\nof things, and satisfies not only the offended party, but all wise\nlookers-on, even as beautiful music or a fine piece of architecture\nsatisfies a well-constituted mind. It is thus that the torments of the\ndamned continue, even tho they serve no longer to turn anyone away from\nsin, and that the rewards of the blest continue, even tho they confirm\nno one in good ways. The damned draw to themselves ever new penalties\nby their continuing sins, and the blest attract ever fresh joys by their\nunceasing progress in good. Both facts are founded on the principle of\nfitness, ... for God has made all things harmonious in perfection as I\nhave already said.\"\nLeibnitz's feeble grasp of reality is too obvious to need comment from\nme. It is evident that no realistic image of the experience of a damned\nsoul had ever approached the portals of his mind. Nor had it occurred to\nhim that the smaller is the number of 'samples' of the genus 'lost-soul'\nwhom God throws as a sop to the eternal fitness, the more unequitably\ngrounded is the glory of the blest. What he gives us is a cold literary\nexercise, whose cheerful substance even hell-fire does not warm.\nAnd do not tell me that to show the shallowness of rationalist\nphilosophizing I have had to go back to a shallow wigpated age. The\noptimism of present-day rationalism sounds just as shallow to the\nfact-loving mind. The actual universe is a thing wide open, but\nrationalism makes systems, and systems must be closed. For men in\npractical life perfection is something far off and still in process of\nachievement. This for rationalism is but the illusion of the finite\nand relative: the absolute ground of things is a perfection eternally\ncomplete.\nI find a fine example of revolt against the airy and shallow optimism\nof current religious philosophy in a publication of that valiant\nanarchistic writer Morrison I. Swift. Mr. Swift's anarchism goes a\nlittle farther than mine does, but I confess that I sympathize a\ngood deal, and some of you, I know, will sympathize heartily with his\ndissatisfaction with the idealistic optimisms now in vogue. He begins\nhis pamphlet on 'Human Submission' with a series of city reporter's\nitems from newspapers (suicides, deaths from starvation and the like) as\nspecimens of our civilized regime. For instance:\n\"'After trudging through the snow from one end of the city to the other\nin the vain hope of securing employment, and with his wife and six\nchildren without food and ordered to leave their home in an upper east\nside tenement house because of non-payment of rent, John Corcoran, a\nclerk, to-day ended his life by drinking carbolic acid. Corcoran lost\nhis position three weeks ago through illness, and during the period of\nidleness his scanty savings disappeared. Yesterday he obtained work with\na gang of city snow shovelers, but he was too weak from illness and was\nforced to quit after an hour's trial with the shovel. Then the\nweary task of looking for employment was again resumed. Thoroughly\ndiscouraged, Corcoran returned to his home late last night to find his\nwife and children without food and the notice of dispossession on the\ndoor.' On the following morning he drank the poison.\n\"The records of many more such cases lie before me [Mr. Swift goes on];\nan encyclopedia might easily be filled with their kind. These few I cite\nas an interpretation of the universe. 'We are aware of the presence of\nGod in His world,' says a writer in a recent English Review. [The very\npresence of ill in the temporal order is the condition of the perfection\nof the eternal order, writes Professor Royce ('The World and the\nIndividual,' II, 385).] 'The Absolute is the richer for every discord,\nand for all diversity which it embraces,' says F. H. Bradley (Appearance\nand Reality, 204). He means that these slain men make the universe\nricher, and that is Philosophy. But while Professors Royce and Bradley\nand a whole host of guileless thoroughfed thinkers are unveiling\nReality and the Absolute and explaining away evil and pain, this is the\ncondition of the only beings known to us anywhere in the universe with\na developed consciousness of what the universe is. What these people\nexperience IS Reality. It gives us an absolute phase of the universe. It\nis the personal experience of those most qualified in all our circle\nof knowledge to HAVE experience, to tell us WHAT is. Now, what does\nTHINKING ABOUT the experience of these persons come to compared with\ndirectly, personally feeling it, as they feel it? The philosophers are\ndealing in shades, while those who live and feel know truth. And the\nmind of mankind-not yet the mind of philosophers and of the proprietary\nclass-but of the great mass of the silently thinking and feeling men,\nis coming to this view. They are judging the universe as they have\nheretofore permitted the hierophants of religion and learning to judge\nTHEM. ...\n\"This Cleveland workingman, killing his children and himself [another\nof the cited cases], is one of the elemental, stupendous facts of this\nmodern world and of this universe. It cannot be glozed over or minimized\naway by all the treatises on God, and Love, and Being, helplessly\nexisting in their haughty monumental vacuity. This is one of the simple\nirreducible elements of this world's life after millions of years of\ndivine opportunity and twenty centuries of Christ. It is in the moral\nworld like atoms or sub-atoms in the physical, primary, indestructible.\nAnd what it blazons to man is the ... imposture of all philosophy\nwhich does not see in such events the consummate factor of conscious\nexperience. These facts invincibly prove religion a nullity. Man will\nnot give religion two thousand centuries or twenty centuries more to try\nitself and waste human time; its time is up, its probation is ended.\nIts own record ends it. Mankind has not sons and eternities to spare for\ntrying out discredited systems....\" [Footnote: Morrison I. Swift, Human\nSubmission, Part Second, Philadelphia, Liberty Press, 1905, pp. 4-10.]\nSuch is the reaction of an empiricist mind upon the rationalist bill of\nfare. It is an absolute 'No, I thank you.' \"Religion,\" says Mr. Swift,\n\"is like a sleep-walker to whom actual things are blank.\" And such,\ntho possibly less tensely charged with feeling, is the verdict of\nevery seriously inquiring amateur in philosophy to-day who turns to the\nphilosophy-professors for the wherewithal to satisfy the fulness of his\nnature's needs. Empiricist writers give him a materialism, rationalists\ngive him something religious, but to that religion \"actual things are\nblank.\" He becomes thus the judge of us philosophers. Tender or tough,\nhe finds us wanting. None of us may treat his verdicts disdainfully, for\nafter all, his is the typically perfect mind, the mind the sum of whose\ndemands is greatest, the mind whose criticisms and dissatisfactions are\nfatal in the long run.\nIt is at this point that my own solution begins to appear. I offer the\noddly-named thing pragmatism as a philosophy that can satisfy both kinds\nof demand. It can remain religious like the rationalisms, but at the\nsame time, like the empiricisms, it can preserve the richest intimacy\nwith facts. I hope I may be able to leave many of you with as favorable\nan opinion of it as I preserve myself. Yet, as I am near the end of my\nhour, I will not introduce pragmatism bodily now. I will begin with it\non the stroke of the clock next time. I prefer at the present moment to\nreturn a little on what I have said.\nIf any of you here are professional philosophers, and some of you I know\nto be such, you will doubtless have felt my discourse so far to have\nbeen crude in an unpardonable, nay, in an almost incredible degree.\nTender-minded and tough-minded, what a barbaric disjunction! And, in\ngeneral, when philosophy is all compacted of delicate intellectualities\nand subtleties and scrupulosities, and when every possible sort of\ncombination and transition obtains within its bounds, what a brutal\ncaricature and reduction of highest things to the lowest possible\nexpression is it to represent its field of conflict as a sort of\nrough-and-tumble fight between two hostile temperaments! What a\nchildishly external view! And again, how stupid it is to treat the\nabstractness of rationalist systems as a crime, and to damn them because\nthey offer themselves as sanctuaries and places of escape, rather than\nas prolongations of the world of facts. Are not all our theories just\nremedies and places of escape? And, if philosophy is to be religious,\nhow can she be anything else than a place of escape from the crassness\nof reality's surface? What better thing can she do than raise us out of\nour animal senses and show us another and a nobler home for our minds in\nthat great framework of ideal principles subtending all reality, which\nthe intellect divines? How can principles and general views ever be\nanything but abstract outlines? Was Cologne cathedral built without an\narchitect's plan on paper? Is refinement in itself an abomination? Is\nconcrete rudeness the only thing that's true?\nBelieve me, I feel the full force of the indictment. The picture I\nhave given is indeed monstrously over-simplified and rude. But like all\nabstractions, it will prove to have its use. If philosophers can treat\nthe life of the universe abstractly, they must not complain of an\nabstract treatment of the life of philosophy itself. In point of fact\nthe picture I have given is, however coarse and sketchy, literally true.\nTemperaments with their cravings and refusals do determine men in their\nphilosophies, and always will. The details of systems may be reasoned\nout piecemeal, and when the student is working at a system, he may\noften forget the forest for the single tree. But when the labor is\naccomplished, the mind always performs its big summarizing act, and the\nsystem forthwith stands over against one like a living thing, with that\nstrange simple note of individuality which haunts our memory, like the\nwraith of the man, when a friend or enemy of ours is dead.\nNot only Walt Whitman could write \"who touches this book touches a man.\"\nThe books of all the great philosophers are like so many men. Our\nsense of an essential personal flavor in each one of them, typical but\nindescribable, is the finest fruit of our own accomplished philosophic\neducation. What the system pretends to be is a picture of the great\nuniverse of God. What it is--and oh so flagrantly!--is the revelation of\nhow intensely odd the personal flavor of some fellow creature is. Once\nreduced to these terms (and all our philosophies get reduced to them in\nminds made critical by learning) our commerce with the systems reverts\nto the informal, to the instinctive human reaction of satisfaction or\ndislike. We grow as peremptory in our rejection or admission, as when a\nperson presents himself as a candidate for our favor; our verdicts are\ncouched in as simple adjectives of praise or dispraise. We measure the\ntotal character of the universe as we feel it, against the flavor of the\nphilosophy proffered us, and one word is enough.\n\"Statt der lebendigen Natur,\" we say, \"da Gott die Menschen schuf\nhinein\"--that nebulous concoction, that wooden, that straight-laced\nthing, that crabbed artificiality, that musty schoolroom product, that\nsick man's dream! Away with it. Away with all of them! Impossible!\nImpossible!\nOur work over the details of his system is indeed what gives us our\nresultant impression of the philosopher, but it is on the resultant\nimpression itself that we react. Expertness in philosophy is measured\nby the definiteness of our summarizing reactions, by the immediate\nperceptive epithet with which the expert hits such complex objects\noff. But great expertness is not necessary for the epithet to come. Few\npeople have definitely articulated philosophies of their own. But almost\neveryone has his own peculiar sense of a certain total character in\nthe universe, and of the inadequacy fully to match it of the peculiar\nsystems that he knows. They don't just cover HIS world. One will be too\ndapper, another too pedantic, a third too much of a job-lot of opinions,\na fourth too morbid, and a fifth too artificial, or what not. At any\nrate he and we know offhand that such philosophies are out of plumb and\nout of key and out of 'whack,' and have no business to speak up in the\nuniverse's name. Plato, Locke, Spinoza, Mill, Caird, Hegel--I prudently\navoid names nearer home!--I am sure that to many of you, my hearers,\nthese names are little more than reminders of as many curious personal\nways of falling short. It would be an obvious absurdity if such ways of\ntaking the universe were actually true. We philosophers have to reckon\nwith such feelings on your part. In the last resort, I repeat, it will\nbe by them that all our philosophies shall ultimately be judged. The\nfinally victorious way of looking at things will be the most completely\nIMPRESSIVE way to the normal run of minds.\nOne word more--namely about philosophies necessarily being abstract\noutlines. There are outlines and outlines, outlines of buildings\nthat are FAT, conceived in the cube by their planner, and outlines of\nbuildings invented flat on paper, with the aid of ruler and compass.\nThese remain skinny and emaciated even when set up in stone and mortar,\nand the outline already suggests that result. An outline in itself is\nmeagre, truly, but it does not necessarily suggest a meagre thing. It is\nthe essential meagreness of WHAT IS SUGGESTED by the usual rationalistic\nphilosophies that moves empiricists to their gesture of rejection. The\ncase of Herbert Spencer's system is much to the point here. Rationalists\nfeel his fearful array of insufficiencies. His dry schoolmaster\ntemperament, the hurdy-gurdy monotony of him, his preference for\ncheap makeshifts in argument, his lack of education even in mechanical\nprinciples, and in general the vagueness of all his fundamental ideas,\nhis whole system wooden, as if knocked together out of cracked hemlock\nboards--and yet the half of England wants to bury him in Westminster\nAbbey.\nWhy? Why does Spencer call out so much reverence in spite of his\nweakness in rationalistic eyes? Why should so many educated men who\nfeel that weakness, you and I perhaps, wish to see him in the Abbey\nnotwithstanding?\nSimply because we feel his heart to be IN THE RIGHT PLACE\nphilosophically. His principles may be all skin and bone, but at any\nrate his books try to mould themselves upon the particular shape of\nthis, particular world's carcase. The noise of facts resounds through\nall his chapters, the citations of fact never cease, he emphasizes\nfacts, turns his face towards their quarter; and that is enough. It\nmeans the right kind of thing for the empiricist mind.\nThe pragmatistic philosophy of which I hope to begin talking in my\nnext lecture preserves as cordial a relation with facts, and, unlike\nSpencer's philosophy, it neither begins nor ends by turning positive\nreligious constructions out of doors--it treats them cordially as well.\nI hope I may lead you to find it just the mediating way of thinking that\nyou require.\nLecture II\nWhat Pragmatism Means\nSome years ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I\nreturned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a ferocious\nmetaphysical dispute. The corpus of the dispute was a squirrel--a live\nsquirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over\nagainst the tree's opposite side a human being was imagined to stand.\nThis human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly\nround the tree, but no matter how fast he goes, the squirrel moves\nas fast in the opposite direction, and always keeps the tree between\nhimself and the man, so that never a glimpse of him is caught. The\nresultant metaphysical problem now is this: DOES THE MAN GO ROUND THE\nSQUIRREL OR NOT? He goes round the tree, sure enough, and the squirrel\nis on the tree; but does he go round the squirrel? In the unlimited\nleisure of the wilderness, discussion had been worn threadbare. Everyone\nhad taken sides, and was obstinate; and the numbers on both sides were\neven. Each side, when I appeared, therefore appealed to me to make it\na majority. Mindful of the scholastic adage that whenever you meet a\ncontradiction you must make a distinction, I immediately sought and\nfound one, as follows: \"Which party is right,\" I said, \"depends on what\nyou PRACTICALLY MEAN by 'going round' the squirrel. If you mean passing\nfrom the north of him to the east, then to the south, then to the west,\nand then to the north of him again, obviously the man does go round him,\nfor he occupies these successive positions. But if on the contrary you\nmean being first in front of him, then on the right of him, then behind\nhim, then on his left, and finally in front again, it is quite as\nobvious that the man fails to go round him, for by the compensating\nmovements the squirrel makes, he keeps his belly turned towards the man\nall the time, and his back turned away. Make the distinction, and there\nis no occasion for any farther dispute. You are both right and both\nwrong according as you conceive the verb 'to go round' in one practical\nfashion or the other.\"\nAltho one or two of the hotter disputants called my speech a shuffling\nevasion, saying they wanted no quibbling or scholastic hair-splitting,\nbut meant just plain honest English 'round,' the majority seemed to\nthink that the distinction had assuaged the dispute.\nI tell this trivial anecdote because it is a peculiarly simple example\nof what I wish now to speak of as THE PRAGMATIC METHOD. The pragmatic\nmethod is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that\notherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or many?--fated or\nfree?--material or spiritual?--here are notions either of which may\nor may not hold good of the world; and disputes over such notions are\nunending. The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each\nnotion by tracing its respective practical consequences. What difference\nwould it practically make to anyone if this notion rather than that\nnotion were true? If no practical difference whatever can be traced,\nthen the alternatives mean practically the same thing, and all dispute\nis idle. Whenever a dispute is serious, we ought to be able to show some\npractical difference that must follow from one side or the other's being\nright.\nA glance at the history of the idea will show you still better what\npragmatism means. The term is derived from the same Greek word [pi rho\nalpha gamma mu alpha], meaning action, from which our words 'practice'\nand 'practical' come. It was first introduced into philosophy by Mr.\nCharles Peirce in 1878. In an article entitled 'How to Make Our Ideas\nClear,' in the 'Popular Science Monthly' for January of that year\n[Footnote: Translated in the Revue Philosophique for January, 1879 (vol.\nvii).] Mr. Peirce, after pointing out that our beliefs are really rules\nfor action, said that to develope a thought's meaning, we need only\ndetermine what conduct it is fitted to produce: that conduct is for\nus its sole significance. And the tangible fact at the root of all our\nthought-distinctions, however subtle, is that there is no one of them so\nfine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice.\nTo attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need\nonly consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind the object\nmay involve--what sensations we are to expect from it, and what\nreactions we must prepare. Our conception of these effects, whether\nimmediate or remote, is then for us the whole of our conception of the\nobject, so far as that conception has positive significance at all.\nThis is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. It lay\nentirely unnoticed by anyone for twenty years, until I, in an address\nbefore Professor Howison's philosophical union at the university of\nCalifornia, brought it forward again and made a special application\nof it to religion. By that date (1898) the times seemed ripe for its\nreception. The word 'pragmatism' spread, and at present it fairly\nspots the pages of the philosophic journals. On all hands we find the\n'pragmatic movement' spoken of, sometimes with respect, sometimes with\ncontumely, seldom with clear understanding. It is evident that the term\napplies itself conveniently to a number of tendencies that hitherto have\nlacked a collective name, and that it has 'come to stay.'\nTo take in the importance of Peirce's principle, one must get accustomed\nto applying it to concrete cases. I found a few years ago that Ostwald,\nthe illustrious Leipzig chemist, had been making perfectly distinct\nuse of the principle of pragmatism in his lectures on the philosophy of\nscience, tho he had not called it by that name.\n\"All realities influence our practice,\" he wrote me, \"and that influence\nis their meaning for us. I am accustomed to put questions to my classes\nin this way: In what respects would the world be different if this\nalternative or that were true? If I can find nothing that would become\ndifferent, then the alternative has no sense.\"\nThat is, the rival views mean practically the same thing, and meaning,\nother than practical, there is for us none. Ostwald in a published\nlecture gives this example of what he means. Chemists have long wrangled\nover the inner constitution of certain bodies called 'tautomerous.'\nTheir properties seemed equally consistent with the notion that an\ninstable hydrogen atom oscillates inside of them, or that they are\ninstable mixtures of two bodies. Controversy raged; but never was\ndecided. \"It would never have begun,\" says Ostwald, \"if the combatants\nhad asked themselves what particular experimental fact could have been\nmade different by one or the other view being correct. For it would then\nhave appeared that no difference of fact could possibly ensue; and the\nquarrel was as unreal as if, theorizing in primitive times about the\nraising of dough by yeast, one party should have invoked a 'brownie,'\nwhile another insisted on an 'elf' as the true cause of the phenomenon.\"\n[Footnote: 'Theorie und Praxis,' Zeitsch. des Oesterreichischen\nIngenieur u. Architecten-Vereines, 1905, Nr. 4 u. 6. I find a still\nmore radical pragmatism than Ostwald's in an address by Professor W.\nS. Franklin: \"I think that the sickliest notion of physics, even if a\nstudent gets it, is that it is 'the science of masses, molecules and the\nether.' And I think that the healthiest notion, even if a student does\nnot wholly get it, is that physics is the science of the ways of taking\nhold of bodies and pushing them!\" (Science, January 2, 1903.)]\nIt is astonishing to see how many philosophical disputes collapse\ninto insignificance the moment you subject them to this simple test of\ntracing a concrete consequence. There can BE no difference any-where\nthat doesn't MAKE a difference elsewhere--no difference in abstract\ntruth that doesn't express itself in a difference in concrete fact and\nin conduct consequent upon that fact, imposed on somebody, somehow,\nsomewhere and somewhen. The whole function of philosophy ought to be\nto find out what definite difference it will make to you and me,\nat definite instants of our life, if this world-formula or that\nworld-formula be the true one.\nThere is absolutely nothing new in the pragmatic method. Socrates was\nan adept at it. Aristotle used it methodically. Locke, Berkeley and Hume\nmade momentous contributions to truth by its means. Shadworth Hodgson\nkeeps insisting that realities are only what they are 'known-as.'\nBut these forerunners of pragmatism used it in fragments: they were\npreluders only. Not until in our time has it generalized itself, become\nconscious of a universal mission, pretended to a conquering destiny. I\nbelieve in that destiny, and I hope I may end by inspiring you with my\nbelief.\nPragmatism represents a perfectly familiar attitude in philosophy, the\nempiricist attitude, but it represents it, as it seems to me, both in\na more radical and in a less objectionable form than it has ever yet\nassumed. A pragmatist turns his back resolutely and once for all upon\na lot of inveterate habits dear to professional philosophers. He turns\naway from abstraction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions, from bad\na priori reasons, from fixed principles, closed systems, and pretended\nabsolutes and origins. He turns towards concreteness and adequacy,\ntowards facts, towards action, and towards power. That means the\nempiricist temper regnant, and the rationalist temper sincerely given\nup. It means the open air and possibilities of nature, as against dogma,\nartificiality and the pretence of finality in truth.\nAt the same time it does not stand for any special results. It is\na method only. But the general triumph of that method would mean an\nenormous change in what I called in my last lecture the 'temperament'\nof philosophy. Teachers of the ultra-rationalistic type would be frozen\nout, much as the courtier type is frozen out in republics, as the\nultramontane type of priest is frozen out in protestant lands. Science\nand metaphysics would come much nearer together, would in fact work\nabsolutely hand in hand.\nMetaphysics has usually followed a very primitive kind of quest. You\nknow how men have always hankered after unlawful magic, and you know\nwhat a great part, in magic, WORDS have always played. If you have his\nname, or the formula of incantation that binds him, you can control the\nspirit, genie, afrite, or whatever the power may be. Solomon knew the\nnames of all the spirits, and having their names, he held them subject\nto his will. So the universe has always appeared to the natural mind as\na kind of enigma, of which the key must be sought in the shape of\nsome illuminating or power-bringing word or name. That word names the\nuniverse's PRINCIPLE, and to possess it is, after a fashion, to\npossess the universe itself. 'God,' 'Matter,' 'Reason,' 'the Absolute,'\n'Energy,' are so many solving names. You can rest when you have them.\nYou are at the end of your metaphysical quest.\nBut if you follow the pragmatic method, you cannot look on any such word\nas closing your quest. You must bring out of each word its practical\ncash-value, set it at work within the stream of your experience. It\nappears less as a solution, then, than as a program for more work,\nand more particularly as an indication of the ways in which existing\nrealities may be CHANGED.\nTHEORIES THUS BECOME INSTRUMENTS, NOT ANSWERS TO ENIGMAS, IN WHICH\nWE CAN REST. We don't lie back upon them, we move forward, and, on\noccasion, make nature over again by their aid. Pragmatism unstiffens all\nour theories, limbers them up and sets each one at work. Being nothing\nessentially new, it harmonizes with many ancient philosophic tendencies.\nIt agrees with nominalism for instance, in always appealing to\nparticulars; with utilitarianism in emphasizing practical aspects; with\npositivism in its disdain for verbal solutions, useless questions, and\nmetaphysical abstractions.\nAll these, you see, are ANTI-INTELLECTUALIST tendencies. Against\nrationalism as a pretension and a method, pragmatism is fully armed\nand militant. But, at the outset, at least, it stands for no particular\nresults. It has no dogmas, and no doctrines save its method. As the\nyoung Italian pragmatist Papini has well said, it lies in the midst of\nour theories, like a corridor in a hotel. Innumerable chambers open out\nof it. In one you may find a man writing an atheistic volume; in the\nnext someone on his knees praying for faith and strength; in a third\na chemist investigating a body's properties. In a fourth a system\nof idealistic metaphysics is being excogitated; in a fifth the\nimpossibility of metaphysics is being shown. But they all own the\ncorridor, and all must pass through it if they want a practicable way of\ngetting into or out of their respective rooms.\nNo particular results then, so far, but only an attitude of orientation,\nis what the pragmatic method means. THE ATTITUDE OF LOOKING AWAY FROM\nFIRST THINGS, PRINCIPLES, 'CATEGORIES,' SUPPOSED NECESSITIES; AND OF\nLOOKING TOWARDS LAST THINGS, FRUITS, CONSEQUENCES, FACTS.\nSo much for the pragmatic method! You may say that I have been praising\nit rather than explaining it to you, but I shall presently explain it\nabundantly enough by showing how it works on some familiar problems.\nMeanwhile the word pragmatism has come to be used in a still wider\nsense, as meaning also a certain theory of TRUTH. I mean to give a whole\nlecture to the statement of that theory, after first paving the way,\nso I can be very brief now. But brevity is hard to follow, so I ask\nfor your redoubled attention for a quarter of an hour. If much remains\nobscure, I hope to make it clearer in the later lectures.\nOne of the most successfully cultivated branches of philosophy in our\ntime is what is called inductive logic, the study of the conditions\nunder which our sciences have evolved. Writers on this subject have\nbegun to show a singular unanimity as to what the laws of nature and\nelements of fact mean, when formulated by mathematicians, physicists and\nchemists. When the first mathematical, logical and natural uniformities,\nthe first LAWS, were discovered, men were so carried away by the\nclearness, beauty and simplification that resulted, that they believed\nthemselves to have deciphered authentically the eternal thoughts of the\nAlmighty. His mind also thundered and reverberated in syllogisms.\nHe also thought in conic sections, squares and roots and ratios, and\ngeometrized like Euclid. He made Kepler's laws for the planets to\nfollow; he made velocity increase proportionally to the time in falling\nbodies; he made the law of the sines for light to obey when refracted;\nhe established the classes, orders, families and genera of plants and\nanimals, and fixed the distances between them. He thought the archetypes\nof all things, and devised their variations; and when we rediscover any\none of these his wondrous institutions, we seize his mind in its very\nliteral intention.\nBut as the sciences have developed farther, the notion has gained ground\nthat most, perhaps all, of our laws are only approximations. The laws\nthemselves, moreover, have grown so numerous that there is no counting\nthem; and so many rival formulations are proposed in all the branches of\nscience that investigators have become accustomed to the notion that no\ntheory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but that any one of them\nmay from some point of view be useful. Their great use is to summarize\nold facts and to lead to new ones. They are only a man-made language,\na conceptual shorthand, as someone calls them, in which we write our\nreports of nature; and languages, as is well known, tolerate much choice\nof expression and many dialects.\nThus human arbitrariness has driven divine necessity from scientific\nlogic. If I mention the names of Sigwart, Mach, Ostwald, Pearson,\nMilhaud, Poincare, Duhem, Ruyssen, those of you who are students will\neasily identify the tendency I speak of, and will think of additional\nnames.\nRiding now on the front of this wave of scientific logic Messrs.\nSchiller and Dewey appear with their pragmatistic account of what truth\neverywhere signifies. Everywhere, these teachers say, 'truth' in our\nideas and beliefs means the same thing that it means in science. It\nmeans, they say, nothing but this, THAT IDEAS (WHICH THEMSELVES ARE BUT\nPARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE) BECOME TRUE JUST IN SO FAR AS THEY HELP US TO\nGET INTO SATISFACTORY RELATION WITH OTHER PARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE, to\nsummarize them and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts instead\nof following the interminable succession of particular phenomena. Any\nidea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that will carry us\nprosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part,\nlinking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying,\nsaving labor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true\nINSTRUMENTALLY. This is the 'instrumental' view of truth taught so\nsuccessfully at Chicago, the view that truth in our ideas means their\npower to 'work,' promulgated so brilliantly at Oxford.\nMessrs. Dewey, Schiller and their allies, in reaching this general\nconception of all truth, have only followed the example of geologists,\nbiologists and philologists. In the establishment of these other\nsciences, the successful stroke was always to take some simple process\nactually observable in operation--as denudation by weather, say, or\nvariation from parental type, or change of dialect by incorporation of\nnew words and pronunciations--and then to generalize it, making it apply\nto all times, and produce great results by summating its effects through\nthe ages.\nThe observable process which Schiller and Dewey particularly singled out\nfor generalization is the familiar one by which any individual settles\ninto NEW OPINIONS. The process here is always the same. The individual\nhas a stock of old opinions already, but he meets a new experience that\nputs them to a strain. Somebody contradicts them; or in a reflective\nmoment he discovers that they contradict each other; or he hears of\nfacts with which they are incompatible; or desires arise in him which\nthey cease to satisfy. The result is an inward trouble to which his\nmind till then had been a stranger, and from which he seeks to escape\nby modifying his previous mass of opinions. He saves as much of it as he\ncan, for in this matter of belief we are all extreme conservatives. So\nhe tries to change first this opinion, and then that (for they resist\nchange very variously), until at last some new idea comes up which he\ncan graft upon the ancient stock with a minimum of disturbance of the\nlatter, some idea that mediates between the stock and the new experience\nand runs them into one another most felicitously and expediently.\nThis new idea is then adopted as the true one. It preserves the older\nstock of truths with a minimum of modification, stretching them just\nenough to make them admit the novelty, but conceiving that in ways as\nfamiliar as the case leaves possible. An outree explanation, violating\nall our preconceptions, would never pass for a true account of a\nnovelty. We should scratch round industriously till we found something\nless excentric. The most violent revolutions in an individual's beliefs\nleave most of his old order standing. Time and space, cause and effect,\nnature and history, and one's own biography remain untouched. New truth\nis always a go-between, a smoother-over of transitions. It marries old\nopinion to new fact so as ever to show a minimum of jolt, a maximum of\ncontinuity. We hold a theory true just in proportion to its success in\nsolving this 'problem of maxima and minima.' But success in solving\nthis problem is eminently a matter of approximation. We say this theory\nsolves it on the whole more satisfactorily than that theory; but that\nmeans more satisfactorily to ourselves, and individuals will emphasize\ntheir points of satisfaction differently. To a certain degree,\ntherefore, everything here is plastic.\nThe point I now urge you to observe particularly is the part played by\nthe older truths. Failure to take account of it is the source of much\nof the unjust criticism leveled against pragmatism. Their influence is\nabsolutely controlling. Loyalty to them is the first principle--in\nmost cases it is the only principle; for by far the most usual way\nof handling phenomena so novel that they would make for a serious\nrearrangement of our preconceptions is to ignore them altogether, or to\nabuse those who bear witness for them.\nYou doubtless wish examples of this process of truth's growth, and the\nonly trouble is their superabundance. The simplest case of new truth is\nof course the mere numerical addition of new kinds of facts, or of new\nsingle facts of old kinds, to our experience--an addition that involves\nno alteration in the old beliefs. Day follows day, and its contents are\nsimply added. The new contents themselves are not true, they simply COME\nand ARE. Truth is what we say about them, and when we say that they have\ncome, truth is satisfied by the plain additive formula.\nBut often the day's contents oblige a rearrangement. If I should now\nutter piercing shrieks and act like a maniac on this platform, it\nwould make many of you revise your ideas as to the probable worth of my\nphilosophy. 'Radium' came the other day as part of the day's content,\nand seemed for a moment to contradict our ideas of the whole order of\nnature, that order having come to be identified with what is called\nthe conservation of energy. The mere sight of radium paying heat away\nindefinitely out of its own pocket seemed to violate that conservation.\nWhat to think? If the radiations from it were nothing but an escape of\nunsuspected 'potential' energy, pre-existent inside of the atoms, the\nprinciple of conservation would be saved. The discovery of 'helium' as\nthe radiation's outcome, opened a way to this belief. So Ramsay's view\nis generally held to be true, because, altho it extends our old ideas of\nenergy, it causes a minimum of alteration in their nature.\nI need not multiply instances. A new opinion counts as 'true' just in\nproportion as it gratifies the individual's desire to assimilate the\nnovel in his experience to his beliefs in stock. It must both lean on\nold truth and grasp new fact; and its success (as I said a moment ago)\nin doing this, is a matter for the individual's appreciation. When\nold truth grows, then, by new truth's addition, it is for subjective\nreasons. We are in the process and obey the reasons. That new idea is\ntruest which performs most felicitously its function of satisfying our\ndouble urgency. It makes itself true, gets itself classed as true, by\nthe way it works; grafting itself then upon the ancient body of truth,\nwhich thus grows much as a tree grows by the activity of a new layer of\ncambium.\nNow Dewey and Schiller proceed to generalize this observation and\nto apply it to the most ancient parts of truth. They also once were\nplastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also\nmediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel\nobservations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose establishment the\nfunction of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of\nexperience with newer parts played no role whatever, is nowhere to be\nfound. The reasons why we call things true is the reason why they ARE\ntrue, for 'to be true' MEANS only to perform this marriage-function.\nThe trail of the human serpent is thus over everything. Truth\nindependent; truth that we FIND merely; truth no longer malleable to\nhuman need; truth incorrigible, in a word; such truth exists indeed\nsuperabundantly--or is supposed to exist by rationalistically minded\nthinkers; but then it means only the dead heart of the living tree, and\nits being there means only that truth also has its paleontology and its\n'prescription,' and may grow stiff with years of veteran service and\npetrified in men's regard by sheer antiquity. But how plastic even the\noldest truths nevertheless really are has been vividly shown in our\nday by the transformation of logical and mathematical ideas, a\ntransformation which seems even to be invading physics. The ancient\nformulas are reinterpreted as special expressions of much wider\nprinciples, principles that our ancestors never got a glimpse of in\ntheir present shape and formulation.\nMr. Schiller still gives to all this view of truth the name of\n'Humanism,' but, for this doctrine too, the name of pragmatism seems\nfairly to be in the ascendant, so I will treat it under the name of\npragmatism in these lectures.\nSuch then would be the scope of pragmatism--first, a method; and second,\na genetic theory of what is meant by truth. And these two things must be\nour future topics.\nWhat I have said of the theory of truth will, I am sure, have appeared\nobscure and unsatisfactory to most of you by reason of us brevity. I\nshall make amends for that hereafter. In a lecture on 'common sense' I\nshall try to show what I mean by truths grown petrified by antiquity. In\nanother lecture I shall expatiate on the idea that our thoughts become\ntrue in proportion as they successfully exert their go-between function.\nIn a third I shall show how hard it is to discriminate subjective from\nobjective factors in Truth's development. You may not follow me wholly\nin these lectures; and if you do, you may not wholly agree with me. But\nyou will, I know, regard me at least as serious, and treat my effort\nwith respectful consideration.\nYou will probably be surprised to learn, then, that Messrs. Schiller's\nand Dewey's theories have suffered a hailstorm of contempt and ridicule.\nAll rationalism has risen against them. In influential quarters Mr.\nSchiller, in particular, has been treated like an impudent schoolboy who\ndeserves a spanking. I should not mention this, but for the fact that it\nthrows so much sidelight upon that rationalistic temper to which I have\nopposed the temper of pragmatism. Pragmatism is uncomfortable away from\nfacts. Rationalism is comfortable only in the presence of abstractions.\nThis pragmatist talk about truths in the plural, about their utility\nand satisfactoriness, about the success with which they 'work,' etc.,\nsuggests to the typical intellectualist mind a sort of coarse lame\nsecond-rate makeshift article of truth. Such truths are not real truth.\nSuch tests are merely subjective. As against this, objective truth must\nbe something non-utilitarian, haughty, refined, remote, august, exalted.\nIt must be an absolute correspondence of our thoughts with an equally\nabsolute reality. It must be what we OUGHT to think, unconditionally.\nThe conditioned ways in which we DO think are so much irrelevance and\nmatter for psychology. Down with psychology, up with logic, in all this\nquestion!\nSee the exquisite contrast of the types of mind! The pragmatist clings\nto facts and concreteness, observes truth at its work in particular\ncases, and generalizes. Truth, for him, becomes a class-name for all\nsorts of definite working-values in experience. For the rationalist it\nremains a pure abstraction, to the bare name of which we must defer.\nWhen the pragmatist undertakes to show in detail just WHY we must defer,\nthe rationalist is unable to recognize the concretes from which his own\nabstraction is taken. He accuses us of DENYING truth; whereas we have\nonly sought to trace exactly why people follow it and always ought\nto follow it. Your typical ultra-abstractionist fairly shudders at\nconcreteness: other things equal, he positively prefers the pale and\nspectral. If the two universes were offered, he would always choose the\nskinny outline rather than the rich thicket of reality. It is so much\npurer, clearer, nobler.\nI hope that as these lectures go on, the concreteness and closeness to\nfacts of the pragmatism which they advocate may be what approves itself\nto you as its most satisfactory peculiarity. It only follows here the\nexample of the sister-sciences, interpreting the unobserved by the\nobserved. It brings old and new harmoniously together. It converts the\nabsolutely empty notion of a static relation of 'correspondence' (what\nthat may mean we must ask later) between our minds and reality, into\nthat of a rich and active commerce (that anyone may follow in detail and\nunderstand) between particular thoughts of ours, and the great universe\nof other experiences in which they play their parts and have their uses.\nBut enough of this at present? The justification of what I say must be\npostponed. I wish now to add a word in further explanation of the claim\nI made at our last meeting, that pragmatism may be a happy harmonizer\nof empiricist ways of thinking, with the more religious demands of human\nbeings.\nMen who are strongly of the fact-loving temperament, you may remember me\nto have said, are liable to be kept at a distance by the small sympathy\nwith facts which that philosophy from the present-day fashion of\nidealism offers them. It is far too intellectualistic. Old fashioned\ntheism was bad enough, with its notion of God as an exalted monarch,\nmade up of a lot of unintelligible or preposterous 'attributes'; but, so\nlong as it held strongly by the argument from design, it kept some touch\nwith concrete realities. Since, however, darwinism has once for all\ndisplaced design from the minds of the 'scientific,' theism has lost\nthat foothold; and some kind of an immanent or pantheistic deity working\nIN things rather than above them is, if any, the kind recommended to our\ncontemporary imagination. Aspirants to a philosophic religion turn, as a\nrule, more hopefully nowadays towards idealistic pantheism than towards\nthe older dualistic theism, in spite of the fact that the latter still\ncounts able defenders.\nBut, as I said in my first lecture, the brand of pantheism offered is\nhard for them to assimilate if they are lovers of facts, or empirically\nminded. It is the absolutistic brand, spurning the dust and reared upon\npure logic. It keeps no connexion whatever with concreteness. Affirming\nthe Absolute Mind, which is its substitute for God, to be the rational\npresupposition of all particulars of fact, whatever they may be, it\nremains supremely indifferent to what the particular facts in our world\nactually are. Be they what they may, the Absolute will father them. Like\nthe sick lion in Esop's fable, all footprints lead into his den,\nbut nulla vestigia retrorsum. You cannot redescend into the world of\nparticulars by the Absolute's aid, or deduce any necessary consequences\nof detail important for your life from your idea of his nature. He gives\nyou indeed the assurance that all is well with Him, and for his eternal\nway of thinking; but thereupon he leaves you to be finitely saved by\nyour own temporal devices.\nFar be it from me to deny the majesty of this conception, or its\ncapacity to yield religious comfort to a most respectable class of\nminds. But from the human point of view, no one can pretend that it\ndoesn't suffer from the faults of remoteness and abstractness. It is\neminently a product of what I have ventured to call the rationalistic\ntemper. It disdains empiricism's needs. It substitutes a pallid outline\nfor the real world's richness. It is dapper; it is noble in the bad\nsense, in the sense in which to be noble is to be inapt for humble\nservice. In this real world of sweat and dirt, it seems to me that\nwhen a view of things is 'noble,' that ought to count as a presumption\nagainst its truth, and as a philosophic disqualification. The prince of\ndarkness may be a gentleman, as we are told he is, but whatever the\nGod of earth and heaven is, he can surely be no gentleman. His menial\nservices are needed in the dust of our human trials, even more than his\ndignity is needed in the empyrean.\nNow pragmatism, devoted tho she be to facts, has no such materialistic\nbias as ordinary empiricism labors under. Moreover, she has no objection\nwhatever to the realizing of abstractions, so long as you get about\namong particulars with their aid and they actually carry you somewhere.\nInterested in no conclusions but those which our minds and our\nexperiences work out together, she has no a priori prejudices against\ntheology. IF THEOLOGICAL IDEAS PROVE TO HAVE A VALUE FOR CONCRETE LIFE,\nTHEY WILL BE TRUE, FOR PRAGMATISM, IN THE SENSE OF BEING GOOD FOR SO\nMUCH. FOR HOW MUCH MORE THEY ARE TRUE, WILL DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THEIR\nRELATIONS TO THE OTHER TRUTHS THAT ALSO HAVE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED.\nWhat I said just now about the Absolute of transcendental idealism is a\ncase in point. First, I called it majestic and said it yielded religious\ncomfort to a class of minds, and then I accused it of remoteness and\nsterility. But so far as it affords such comfort, it surely is not\nsterile; it has that amount of value; it performs a concrete function.\nAs a good pragmatist, I myself ought to call the Absolute true 'in so\nfar forth,' then; and I unhesitatingly now do so.\nBut what does TRUE IN SO FAR FORTH mean in this case? To answer, we need\nonly apply the pragmatic method. What do believers in the Absolute mean\nby saying that their belief affords them comfort? They mean that since\nin the Absolute finite evil is 'overruled' already, we may, therefore,\nwhenever we wish, treat the temporal as if it were potentially the\neternal, be sure that we can trust its outcome, and, without sin,\ndismiss our fear and drop the worry of our finite responsibility. In\nshort, they mean that we have a right ever and anon to take a moral\nholiday, to let the world wag in its own way, feeling that its issues\nare in better hands than ours and are none of our business.\nThe universe is a system of which the individual members may relax their\nanxieties occasionally, in which the don't-care mood is also right for\nmen, and moral holidays in order--that, if I mistake not, is part, at\nleast, of what the Absolute is 'known-as,' that is the great difference\nin our particular experiences which his being true makes for us, that\nis part of his cash-value when he is pragmatically interpreted. Farther\nthan that the ordinary lay-reader in philosophy who thinks favorably of\nabsolute idealism does not venture to sharpen his conceptions. He can\nuse the Absolute for so much, and so much is very precious. He is pained\nat hearing you speak incredulously of the Absolute, therefore, and\ndisregards your criticisms because they deal with aspects of the\nconception that he fails to follow.\nIf the Absolute means this, and means no more than this, who can\npossibly deny the truth of it? To deny it would be to insist that men\nshould never relax, and that holidays are never in order. I am well\naware how odd it must seem to some of you to hear me say that an idea is\n'true' so long as to believe it is profitable to our lives. That it is\nGOOD, for as much as it profits, you will gladly admit. If what we do\nby its aid is good, you will allow the idea itself to be good in so far\nforth, for we are the better for possessing it. But is it not a strange\nmisuse of the word 'truth,' you will say, to call ideas also 'true' for\nthis reason?\nTo answer this difficulty fully is impossible at this stage of\nmy account. You touch here upon the very central point of Messrs.\nSchiller's, Dewey's and my own doctrine of truth, which I cannot discuss\nwith detail until my sixth lecture. Let me now say only this, that truth\nis ONE SPECIES OF GOOD, and not, as is usually supposed, a category\ndistinct from good, and co-ordinate with it. THE TRUE IS THE NAME OF\nWHATEVER PROVES ITSELF TO BE GOOD IN THE WAY OF BELIEF, AND GOOD, TOO,\nFOR DEFINITE, ASSIGNABLE REASONS. Surely you must admit this, that if\nthere were NO good for life in true ideas, or if the knowledge of them\nwere positively disadvantageous and false ideas the only useful ones,\nthen the current notion that truth is divine and precious, and its\npursuit a duty, could never have grown up or become a dogma. In a world\nlike that, our duty would be to SHUN truth, rather. But in this world,\njust as certain foods are not only agreeable to our taste, but good for\nour teeth, our stomach and our tissues; so certain ideas are not only\nagreeable to think about, or agreeable as supporting other ideas that we\nare fond of, but they are also helpful in life's practical struggles. If\nthere be any life that it is really better we should lead, and if there\nbe any idea which, if believed in, would help us to lead that life,\nthen it would be really BETTER FOR US to believe in that idea, UNLESS,\nINDEED, BELIEF IN IT INCIDENTALLY CLASHED WITH OTHER GREATER VITAL\nBENEFITS.\n'What would be better for us to believe'! This sounds very like a\ndefinition of truth. It comes very near to saying 'what we OUGHT to\nbelieve': and in THAT definition none of you would find any oddity.\nOught we ever not to believe what it is BETTER FOR US to believe? And\ncan we then keep the notion of what is better for us, and what is true\nfor us, permanently apart?\nPragmatism says no, and I fully agree with her. Probably you also agree,\nso far as the abstract statement goes, but with a suspicion that if\nwe practically did believe everything that made for good in our own\npersonal lives, we should be found indulging all kinds of fancies about\nthis world's affairs, and all kinds of sentimental superstitions about a\nworld hereafter. Your suspicion here is undoubtedly well founded, and it\nis evident that something happens when you pass from the abstract to the\nconcrete, that complicates the situation.\nI said just now that what is better for us to believe is true UNLESS THE\nBELIEF INCIDENTALLY CLASHES WITH SOME OTHER VITAL BENEFIT. Now in real\nlife what vital benefits is any particular belief of ours most liable\nto clash with? What indeed except the vital benefits yielded by OTHER\nBELIEFS when these prove incompatible with the first ones? In other\nwords, the greatest enemy of any one of our truths may be the rest\nof our truths. Truths have once for all this desperate instinct of\nself-preservation and of desire to extinguish whatever contradicts them.\nMy belief in the Absolute, based on the good it does me, must run the\ngauntlet of all my other beliefs. Grant that it may be true in giving me\na moral holiday. Nevertheless, as I conceive it,--and let me speak now\nconfidentially, as it were, and merely in my own private person,--it\nclashes with other truths of mine whose benefits I hate to give up on\nits account. It happens to be associated with a kind of logic of which I\nam the enemy, I find that it entangles me in metaphysical paradoxes\nthat are inacceptable, etc., etc.. But as I have enough trouble in\nlife already without adding the trouble of carrying these intellectual\ninconsistencies, I personally just give up the Absolute. I just TAKE my\nmoral holidays; or else as a professional philosopher, I try to justify\nthem by some other principle.\nIf I could restrict my notion of the Absolute to its bare holiday-giving\nvalue, it wouldn't clash with my other truths. But we cannot easily thus\nrestrict our hypotheses. They carry supernumerary features, and these it\nis that clash so. My disbelief in the Absolute means then disbelief\nin those other supernumerary features, for I fully believe in the\nlegitimacy of taking moral holidays.\nYou see by this what I meant when I called pragmatism a mediator and\nreconciler and said, borrowing the word from Papini, that he unstiffens\nour theories. She has in fact no prejudices whatever, no obstructive\ndogmas, no rigid canons of what shall count as proof. She is completely\ngenial. She will entertain any hypothesis, she will consider any\nevidence. It follows that in the religious field she is at a great\nadvantage both over positivistic empiricism, with its anti-theological\nbias, and over religious rationalism, with its exclusive interest in\nthe remote, the noble, the simple, and the abstract in the way of\nconception.\nIn short, she widens the field of search for God. Rationalism sticks\nto logic and the empyrean. Empiricism sticks to the external senses.\nPragmatism is willing to take anything, to follow either logic or the\nsenses, and to count the humblest and most personal experiences. She\nwill count mystical experiences if they have practical consequences.\nShe will take a God who lives in the very dirt of private fact-if that\nshould seem a likely place to find him.\nHer only test of probable truth is what works best in the way of leading\nus, what fits every part of life best and combines with the collectivity\nof experience's demands, nothing being omitted. If theological ideas\nshould do this, if the notion of God, in particular, should prove to do\nit, how could pragmatism possibly deny God's existence? She could see\nno meaning in treating as 'not true' a notion that was pragmatically so\nsuccessful. What other kind of truth could there be, for her, than all\nthis agreement with concrete reality?\nIn my last lecture I shall return again to the relations of pragmatism\nwith religion. But you see already how democratic she is. Her manners\nare as various and flexible, her resources as rich and endless, and her\nconclusions as friendly as those of mother nature.\nLecture III\nSome Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered\nI am now to make the pragmatic method more familiar by giving you some\nillustrations of its application to particular problems. I will begin\nwith what is driest, and the first thing I shall take will be the\nproblem of Substance. Everyone uses the old distinction between\nsubstance and attribute, enshrined as it is in the very structure\nof human language, in the difference between grammatical subject and\npredicate. Here is a bit of blackboard crayon. Its modes, attributes,\nproperties, accidents, or affections,--use which term you will,--are\nwhiteness, friability, cylindrical shape, insolubility in water,\netc., etc. But the bearer of these attributes is so much chalk,\nwhich thereupon is called the substance in which they inhere. So the\nattributes of this desk inhere in the substance 'wood,' those of my coat\nin the substance 'wool,' and so forth. Chalk, wood and wool, show again,\nin spite of their differences, common properties, and in so far forth\nthey are themselves counted as modes of a still more primal substance,\nmatter, the attributes of which are space occupancy and impenetrability.\nSimilarly our thoughts and feelings are affections or properties of our\nseveral souls, which are substances, but again not wholly in their own\nright, for they are modes of the still deeper substance 'spirit.'\nNow it was very early seen that all we know of the chalk is\nthe whiteness, friability, etc., all WE KNOW of the wood is the\ncombustibility and fibrous structure. A group of attributes is what each\nsubstance here is known-as, they form its sole cash-value for our actual\nexperience. The substance is in every case revealed through THEM; if we\nwere cut off from THEM we should never suspect its existence; and if\nGod should keep sending them to us in an unchanged order, miraculously\nannihilating at a certain moment the substance that supported them, we\nnever could detect the moment, for our experiences themselves would be\nunaltered. Nominalists accordingly adopt the opinion that substance is\na spurious idea due to our inveterate human trick of turning names\ninto things. Phenomena come in groups--the chalk-group, the wood-group,\netc.--and each group gets its name. The name we then treat as in a\nway supporting the group of phenomena. The low thermometer to-day,\nfor instance, is supposed to come from something called the 'climate.'\nClimate is really only the name for a certain group of days, but it is\ntreated as if it lay BEHIND the day, and in general we place the name,\nas if it were a being, behind the facts it is the name of. But the\nphenomenal properties of things, nominalists say, surely do not\nreally inhere in names, and if not in names then they do not inhere\nin anything. They ADhere, or COhere, rather, WITH EACH OTHER, and the\nnotion of a substance inaccessible to us, which we think accounts\nfor such cohesion by supporting it, as cement might support pieces of\nmosaic, must be abandoned. The fact of the bare cohesion itself is all\nthat the notion of the substance signifies. Behind that fact is nothing.\nScholasticism has taken the notion of substance from common sense and\nmade it very technical and articulate. Few things would seem to have\nfewer pragmatic consequences for us than substances, cut off as we are\nfrom every contact with them. Yet in one case scholasticism has proved\nthe importance of the substance-idea by treating it pragmatically. I\nrefer to certain disputes about the mystery of the Eucharist. Substance\nhere would appear to have momentous pragmatic value. Since the accidents\nof the wafer don't change in the Lord's supper, and yet it has become\nthe very body of Christ, it must be that the change is in the substance\nsolely. The bread-substance must have been withdrawn, and the divine\nsubstance substituted miraculously without altering the immediate\nsensible properties. But tho these don't alter, a tremendous difference\nhas been made, no less a one than this, that we who take the sacrament,\nnow feed upon the very substance of divinity. The substance-notion\nbreaks into life, then, with tremendous effect, if once you allow that\nsubstances can separate from their accidents, and exchange these latter.\nThis is the only pragmatic application of the substance-idea with\nwhich I am acquainted; and it is obvious that it will only be treated\nseriously by those who already believe in the 'real presence' on\nindependent grounds.\nMATERIAL SUBSTANCE was criticized by Berkeley with such telling effect\nthat his name has reverberated through all subsequent philosophy.\nBerkeley's treatment of the notion of matter is so well known as to need\nhardly more than a mention. So far from denying the external world which\nwe know, Berkeley corroborated it. It was the scholastic notion of a\nmaterial substance unapproachable by us, BEHIND the external world,\ndeeper and more real than it, and needed to support it, which Berkeley\nmaintained to be the most effective of all reducers of the external\nworld to unreality. Abolish that substance, he said, believe that God,\nwhom you can understand and approach, sends you the sensible world\ndirectly, and you confirm the latter and back it up by his divine\nauthority. Berkeley's criticism of 'matter' was consequently absolutely\npragmatistic. Matter is known as our sensations of colour, figure,\nhardness and the like. They are the cash-value of the term. The\ndifference matter makes to us by truly being is that we then get such\nsensations; by not being, is that we lack them. These sensations then\nare its sole meaning. Berkeley doesn't deny matter, then; he simply\ntells us what it consists of. It is a true name for just so much in the\nway of sensations.\nLocke, and later Hume, applied a similar pragmatic criticism to the\nnotion of SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE. I will only mention Locke's treatment\nof our 'personal identity.' He immediately reduces this notion to its\npragmatic value in terms of experience. It means, he says, so much\nconsciousness,' namely the fact that at one moment of life we remember\nother moments, and feel them all as parts of one and the same personal\nhistory. Rationalism had explained this practical continuity in our life\nby the unity of our soul-substance. But Locke says: suppose that God\nshould take away the consciousness, should WE be any the better\nfor having still the soul-principle? Suppose he annexed the same\nconsciousness to different souls, | should we, as WE realize OURSELVES,\nbe any the worse for that fact? In Locke's day the soul was chiefly a\nthing to be rewarded or punished. See how Locke, discussing it from this\npoint of view, keeps the question pragmatic:\nSuppose, he says, one to think himself to be the same soul that once was\nNestor or Thersites. Can he think their actions his own any more than\nthe actions of any other man that ever existed? But | let him once find\nhimself CONSCIOUS of any of the actions of Nestor, he then finds himself\nthe same person with Nestor. ... In this personal identity is founded\nall the right and justice of reward and punishment. It may be reasonable\nto think, no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of,\nbut shall receive his doom, his consciousness accusing or excusing.\nSupposing a man punished now for what he had done in another life,\nwhereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all, what\ndifference is there between that punishment and being created miserable?\nOur personal identity, then, consists, for Locke, solely in\npragmatically definable particulars. Whether, apart from these\nverifiable facts, it also inheres in a spiritual principle, is a merely\ncurious speculation. Locke, compromiser that he was, passively tolerated\nthe belief in a substantial soul behind our consciousness. But his\nsuccessor Hume, and most empirical psychologists after him, have denied\nthe soul, save as the name for verifiable cohesions in our inner life.\nThey redescend into the stream of experience with it, and cash it into\nso much small-change value in the way of 'ideas' and their peculiar\nconnexions with each other. As I said of Berkeley's matter, the soul is\ngood or 'true' for just SO MUCH, but no more.\nThe mention of material substance naturally suggests the doctrine of\n'materialism,' but philosophical materialism is not necessarily knit\nup with belief in 'matter,' as a metaphysical principle. One may\ndeny matter in that sense, as strongly as Berkeley did, one may be a\nphenomenalist like Huxley, and yet one may still be a materialist in the\nwider sense, of explaining higher phenomena by lower ones, and leaving\nthe destinies of the world at the mercy of its blinder parts and forces.\nIt is in this wider sense of the word that materialism is opposed to\nspiritualism or theism. The laws of physical nature are what run things,\nmaterialism says. The highest productions of human genius might be\nciphered by one who had complete acquaintance with the facts, out of\ntheir physiological conditions, regardless whether nature be there only\nfor our minds, as idealists contend, or not. Our minds in any case would\nhave to record the kind of nature it is, and write it down as operating\nthrough blind laws of physics. This is the complexion of present day\nmaterialism, which may better be called naturalism. Over against it\nstands 'theism,' or what in a wide sense may be termed 'spiritualism.'\nSpiritualism says that mind not only witnesses and records things, but\nalso runs and operates them: the world being thus guided, not by its\nlower, but by its higher element.\nTreated as it often is, this question becomes little more than a\nconflict between aesthetic preferences. Matter is gross, coarse, crass,\nmuddy; spirit is pure, elevated, noble; and since it is more consonant\nwith the dignity of the universe to give the primacy in it to what\nappears superior, spirit must be affirmed as the ruling principle. To\ntreat abstract principles as finalities, before which our intellects\nmay come to rest in a state of admiring contemplation, is the great\nrationalist failing. Spiritualism, as often held, may be simply a\nstate of admiration for one kind, and of dislike for another kind,\nof abstraction. I remember a worthy spiritualist professor who always\nreferred to materialism as the 'mud-philosophy,' and deemed it thereby\nrefuted.\nTo such spiritualism as this there is an easy answer, and Mr. Spencer\nmakes it effectively. In some well-written pages at the end of the\nfirst volume of his Psychology he shows us that a 'matter' so infinitely\nsubtile, and performing motions as inconceivably quick and fine as those\nwhich modern science postulates in her explanations, has no trace of\ngrossness left. He shows that the conception of spirit, as we mortals\nhitherto have framed it, is itself too gross to cover the exquisite\ntenuity of nature's facts. Both terms, he says, are but symbols,\npointing to that one unknowable reality in which their oppositions\ncease.\nTo an abstract objection an abstract rejoinder suffices; and so far as\none's opposition to materialism springs from one's disdain of matter as\nsomething 'crass,' Mr. Spencer cuts the ground from under one. Matter is\nindeed infinitely and incredibly refined. To anyone who has ever looked\non the face of a dead child or parent the mere fact that matter COULD\nhave taken for a time that precious form, ought to make matter sacred\never after. It makes no difference what the PRINCIPLE of life may be,\nmaterial or immaterial, matter at any rate co-operates, lends itself\nto all life's purposes. That beloved incarnation was among matter's\npossibilities.\nBut now, instead of resting in principles after this stagnant\nintellectualist fashion, let us apply the pragmatic method to the\nquestion. What do we MEAN by matter? What practical difference can it\nmake NOW that the world should be run by matter or by spirit? I think we\nfind that the problem takes with this a rather different character.\nAnd first of all I call your attention to a curious fact. It makes not\na single jot of difference so far as the PAST of the world goes, whether\nwe deem it to have been the work of matter or whether we think a divine\nspirit was its author.\nImagine, in fact, the entire contents of the world to be once for all\nirrevocably given. Imagine it to end this very moment, and to have\nno future; and then let a theist and a materialist apply their rival\nexplanations to its history. The theist shows how a God made it; the\nmaterialist shows, and we will suppose with equal success, how it\nresulted from blind physical forces. Then let the pragmatist be asked to\nchoose between their theories. How can he apply his test if the world\nis already completed? Concepts for him are things to come back into\nexperience with, things to make us look for differences. But by\nhypothesis there is to be no more experience and no possible differences\ncan now be looked for. Both theories have shown all their consequences\nand, by the hypothesis we are adopting, these are identical. The\npragmatist must consequently say that the two theories, in spite of\ntheir different-sounding names, mean exactly the same thing, and that\nthe dispute is purely verbal. [I am opposing, of course, that the\ntheories HAVE been equally successful in their explanations of what is.]\nFor just consider the case sincerely, and say what would be the WORTH\nof a God if he WERE there, with his work accomplished and his world run\ndown. He would be worth no more than just that world was worth. To that\namount of result, with its mixed merits and defects, his creative power\ncould attain, but go no farther. And since there is to be no future;\nsince the whole value and meaning of the world has been already paid in\nand actualized in the feelings that went with it in the passing, and now\ngo with it in the ending; since it draws no supplemental significance\n(such as our real world draws) from its function of preparing something\nyet to come; why then, by it we take God's measure, as it were. He\nis the Being who could once for all do THAT; and for that much we\nare thankful to him, but for nothing more. But now, on the contrary\nhypothesis, namely, that the bits of matter following their laws could\nmake that world and do no less, should we not be just as thankful to\nthem? Wherein should we suffer loss, then, if we dropped God as an\nhypothesis and made the matter alone responsible? Where would any\nspecial deadness, or crassness, come in? And how, experience being what\nis once for all, would God's presence in it make it any more living or\nricher?\nCandidly, it is impossible to give any answer to this question. The\nactually experienced world is supposed to be the same in its details\non either hypothesis, \"the same, for our praise or blame,\" as Browning\nsays. It stands there indefeasibly: a gift which can't be taken back.\nCalling matter the cause of it retracts no single one of the items that\nhave made it up, nor does calling God the cause augment them. They are\nthe God or the atoms, respectively, of just that and no other world. The\nGod, if there, has been doing just what atoms could do--appearing in the\ncharacter of atoms, so to speak--and earning such gratitude as is due to\natoms, and no more. If his presence lends no different turn or issue to\nthe performance, it surely can lend it no increase of dignity. Nor would\nindignity come to it were he absent, and did the atoms remain the only\nactors on the stage. When a play is once over, and the curtain down,\nyou really make it no better by claiming an illustrious genius for its\nauthor, just as you make it no worse by calling him a common hack.\nThus if no future detail of experience or conduct is to be deduced from\nour hypothesis, the debate between materialism and theism becomes quite\nidle and insignificant. Matter and God in that event mean exactly the\nsame thing--the power, namely, neither more nor less, that could make\njust this completed world--and the wise man is he who in such a case\nwould turn his back on such a supererogatory discussion. Accordingly,\nmost men instinctively, and positivists and scientists deliberately,\ndo turn their backs on philosophical disputes from which nothing in the\nline of definite future consequences can be seen to follow. The verbal\nand empty character of philosophy is surely a reproach with which we\nare, but too familiar. If pragmatism be true, it is a perfectly sound\nreproach unless the theories under fire can be shown to have alternative\npractical outcomes, however delicate and distant these may be. The\ncommon man and the scientist say they discover no such outcomes, and if\nthe metaphysician can discern none either, the others certainly are\nin the right of it, as against him. His science is then but pompous\ntrifling; and the endowment of a professorship for such a being would be\nsilly.\nAccordingly, in every genuine metaphysical debate some practical issue,\nhowever conjectural and remote, is involved. To realize this, revert\nwith me to our question, and place yourselves this time in the world we\nlive in, in the world that HAS a future, that is yet uncompleted whilst\nwe speak. In this unfinished world the alternative of 'materialism or\ntheism?' is intensely practical; and it is worth while for us to spend\nsome minutes of our hour in seeing that it is so.\nHow, indeed, does the program differ for us, according as we consider\nthat the facts of experience up to date are purposeless configurations\nof blind atoms moving according to eternal laws, or that on the other\nhand they are due to the providence of God? As far as the past facts\ngo, indeed there is no difference. Those facts are in, are bagged, are\ncaptured; and the good that's in them is gained, be the atoms or be the\nGod their cause. There are accordingly many materialists about us\nto-day who, ignoring altogether the future and practical aspects of the\nquestion, seek to eliminate the odium attaching to the word materialism,\nand even to eliminate the word itself, by showing that, if matter could\ngive birth to all these gains, why then matter, functionally considered,\nis just as divine an entity as God, in fact coalesces with God, is what\nyou mean by God. Cease, these persons advise us, to use either of these\nterms, with their outgrown opposition. Use a term free of the clerical\nconnotations, on the one hand; of the suggestion of gross-ness,\ncoarseness, ignobility, on the other. Talk of the primal mystery, of the\nunknowable energy, of the one and only power, instead of saying either\nGod or matter. This is the course to which Mr. Spencer urges us; and if\nphilosophy were purely retrospective, he would thereby proclaim himself\nan excellent pragmatist.\nBut philosophy is prospective also, and, after finding what the world\nhas been and done and yielded, still asks the further question 'what\ndoes the world PROMISE?' Give us a matter that promises SUCCESS, that is\nbound by its laws to lead our world ever nearer to perfection, and any\nrational man will worship that matter as readily as Mr. Spencer\nworships his own so-called unknowable power. It not only has made for\nrighteousness up to date, but it will make for righteousness forever;\nand that is all we need. Doing practically all that a God can do, it is\nequivalent to God, its function is a God's function, and is exerted in\na world in which a God would now be superfluous; from such a world a God\ncould never lawfully be missed. 'Cosmic emotion' would here be the right\nname for religion.\nBut is the matter by which Mr. Spencer's process of cosmic evolution is\ncarried on any such principle of never-ending perfection as this? Indeed\nit is not, for the future end of every cosmically evolved thing or\nsystem of things is foretold by science to be death and tragedy; and\nMr. Spencer, in confining himself to the aesthetic and ignoring the\npractical side of the controversy, has really contributed nothing\nserious to its relief. But apply now our principle of practical results,\nand see what a vital significance the question of materialism or theism\nimmediately acquires.\nTheism and materialism, so indifferent when taken retrospectively,\npoint, when we take them prospectively, to wholly different outlooks of\nexperience. For, according to the theory of mechanical evolution, the\nlaws of redistribution of matter and motion, tho they are certainly to\nthank for all the good hours which our organisms have ever yielded\nus and for all the ideals which our minds now frame, are yet fatally\ncertain to undo their work again, and to redissolve everything that they\nhave once evolved. You all know the picture of the last state of the\nuniverse which evolutionary science foresees. I cannot state it better\nthan in Mr. Balfour's words: \"The energies of our system will decay, the\nglory of the sun will be dimmed, and the earth, tideless and inert,\nwill no longer tolerate the race which has for a moment disturbed its\nsolitude. Man will go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will\nperish. The uneasy, consciousness which in this obscure corner has for\na brief space broken the contented silence of the universe, will be at\nrest. Matter will know itself no longer. 'Imperishable monuments' and\n'immortal deeds,' death itself, and love stronger than death, will be as\nthough they had never been. Nor will anything that is, be better or be\nworse for all that the labour, genius, devotion, and suffering of man\nhave striven through countless generations to effect.\" [Footnote: The\nFoundations of Belief, p. 30.]\nThat is the sting of it, that in the vast driftings of the cosmic\nweather, tho many a jeweled shore appears, and many an enchanted\ncloud-bank floats away, long lingering ere it be dissolved--even as our\nworld now lingers, for our joy-yet when these transient products are\ngone, nothing, absolutely NOTHING remains, of represent those particular\nqualities, those elements of preciousness which they may have enshrined.\nDead and gone are they, gone utterly from the very sphere and room of\nbeing. Without an echo; without a memory; without an influence on aught\nthat may come after, to make it care for similar ideals. This utter\nfinal wreck and tragedy is of the essence of scientific materialism\nas at present understood. The lower and not the higher forces are the\neternal forces, or the last surviving forces within the only cycle of\nevolution which we can definitely see. Mr. Spencer believes this as much\nas anyone; so why should he argue with us as if we were making silly\naesthetic objections to the 'grossness' of 'matter and motion,' the\nprinciples of his philosophy, when what really dismays us is the\ndisconsolateness of its ulterior practical results?\nNo the true objection to materialism is not positive but negative. It\nwould be farcical at this day to make complaint of it for what it IS for\n'grossness.' Grossness is what grossness DOES--we now know THAT. We make\ncomplaint of it, on the contrary, for what it is NOT--not a permanent\nwarrant for our more ideal interests, not a fulfiller of our remotest\nhopes.\nThe notion of God, on the other hand, however inferior it may be\nin clearness to those mathematical notions so current in mechanical\nphilosophy, has at least this practical superiority over them, that it\nguarantees an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved. A world\nwith a God in it to say the last word, may indeed burn up or freeze,\nbut we then think of him as still mindful of the old ideals and sure to\nbring them elsewhere to fruition; so that, where he is, tragedy is\nonly provisional and partial, and shipwreck and dissolution not the\nabsolutely final things. This need of an eternal moral order is one\nof the deepest needs of our breast. And those poets, like Dante and\nWordsworth, who live on the conviction of such an order, owe to that\nfact the extraordinary tonic and consoling power of their verse. Here\nthen, in these different emotional and practical appeals, in these\nadjustments of our concrete attitudes of hope and expectation, and all\nthe delicate consequences which their differences entail, lie the\nreal meanings of materialism and spiritualism--not in hair-splitting\nabstractions about matter's inner essence, or about the metaphysical\nattributes of God. Materialism means simply the denial that the moral\norder is eternal, and the cutting off of ultimate hopes; spiritualism\nmeans the affirmation of an eternal moral order and the letting loose of\nhope. Surely here is an issue genuine enough, for anyone who feels\nit; and, as long as men are men, it will yield matter for a serious\nphilosophic debate.\nBut possibly some of you may still rally to their defence. Even whilst\nadmitting that spiritualism and materialism make different prophecies\nof the world's future, you may yourselves pooh-pooh the difference as\nsomething so infinitely remote as to mean nothing for a sane mind. The\nessence of a sane mind, you may say, is to take shorter views, and to\nfeel no concern about such chimaeras as the latter end of the world.\nWell, I can only say that if you say this, you do injustice to human\nnature. Religious melancholy is not disposed of by a simple flourish of\nthe word insanity. The absolute things, the last things, the overlapping\nthings, are the truly philosophic concerns; all superior minds feel\nseriously about them, and the mind with the shortest views is simply the\nmind of the more shallow man.\nThe issues of fact at stake in the debate are of course vaguely enough\nconceived by us at present. But spiritualistic faith in all its forms\ndeals with a world of PROMISE, while materialism's sun sets in a sea of\ndisappointment. Remember what I said of the Absolute: it grants us moral\nholidays. Any religious view does this. It not only incites our more\nstrenuous moments, but it also takes our joyous, careless, trustful\nmoments, and it justifies them. It paints the grounds of justification\nvaguely enough, to be sure. The exact features of the saving future\nfacts that our belief in God insures, will have to be ciphered out\nby the interminable methods of science: we can STUDY our God only by\nstudying his Creation. But we can ENJOY our God, if we have one, in\nadvance of all that labor. I myself believe that the evidence for God\nlies primarily in inner personal experiences. When they have once given\nyou your God, his name means at least the benefit of the holiday. You\nremember what I said yesterday about the way in which truths clash and\ntry to 'down' each other. The truth of 'God' has to run the gauntlet of\nall our other truths. It is on trial by them and they on trial by it.\nOur FINAL opinion about God can be settled only after all the truths\nhave straightened themselves out together. Let us hope that they shall\nfind a modus vivendi!\nLet me pass to a very cognate philosophic problem, the QUESTION of\nDESIGN IN NATURE. God's existence has from time immemorial been held to\nbe proved by certain natural facts. Many facts appear as if expressly\ndesigned in view of one another. Thus the woodpecker's bill, tongue,\nfeet, tail, etc., fit him wondrously for a world of trees with grubs hid\nin their bark to feed upon. The parts of our eye fit the laws of light\nto perfection, leading its rays to a sharp picture on our retina. Such\nmutual fitting of things diverse in origin argued design, it was held;\nand the designer was always treated as a man-loving deity.\nThe first step in these arguments was to prove that the design existed.\nNature was ransacked for results obtained through separate things being\nco-adapted. Our eyes, for instance, originate in intra-uterine darkness,\nand the light originates in the sun, yet see how they fit each other.\nThey are evidently made FOR each other. Vision is the end designed,\nlight and eyes the separate means devised for its attainment.\nIt is strange, considering how unanimously our ancestors felt the force\nof this argument, to see how little it counts for since the triumph\nof the darwinian theory. Darwin opened our minds to the power of\nchance-happenings to bring forth 'fit' results if only they have time\nto add themselves together. He showed the enormous waste of nature in\nproducing results that get destroyed because of their unfitness. He also\nemphasized the number of adaptations which, if designed, would argue\nan evil rather than a good designer. Here all depends upon the point\nof view. To the grub under the bark the exquisite fitness of the\nwoodpecker's organism to extract him would certainly argue a diabolical\ndesigner.\nTheologians have by this time stretched their minds so as to embrace\nthe darwinian facts, and yet to interpret them as still showing divine\npurpose. It used to be a question of purpose AGAINST mechanism, of\none OR the other. It was as if one should say \"My shoes are evidently\ndesigned to fit my feet, hence it is impossible that they should have\nbeen produced by machinery.\" We know that they are both: they are made\nby a machinery itself designed to fit the feet with shoes. Theology need\nonly stretch similarly the designs of God. As the aim of a football-team\nis not merely to get the ball to a certain goal (if that were so, they\nwould simply get up on some dark night and place it there), but to get\nit there by a fixed MACHINERY OF CONDITIONS--the game's rules and the\nopposing players; so the aim of God is not merely, let us say, to make\nmen and to save them, but rather to get this done through the sole\nagency of nature's vast machinery. Without nature's stupendous laws and\ncounterforces, man's creation and perfection, we might suppose, would be\ntoo insipid achievements for God to have designed them.\nThis saves the form of the design-argument at the expense of its old\neasy human content. The designer is no longer the old man-like deity.\nHis designs have grown so vast as to be incomprehensible to us humans.\nThe WHAT of them so overwhelms us that to establish the mere THAT of a\ndesigner for them becomes of very little consequence in comparison.\nWe can with difficulty comprehend the character of a cosmic mind whose\npurposes are fully revealed by the strange mixture of goods and evils\nthat we find in this actual world's particulars. Or rather we cannot by\nany possibility comprehend it. The mere word 'design' by itself has,\nwe see, no consequences and explains nothing. It is the barrenest of\nprinciples. The old question of WHETHER there is design is idle.\nThe real question is WHAT is the world, whether or not it have a\ndesigner--and that can be revealed only by the study of all nature's\nparticulars.\nRemember that no matter what nature may have produced or may be\nproducing, the means must necessarily have been adequate, must have been\nFITTED TO THAT PRODUCTION. The argument from fitness to design would\nconsequently always apply, whatever were the product's character. The\nrecent Mont-Pelee eruption, for example, required all previous history\nto produce that exact combination of ruined houses, human and animal\ncorpses, sunken ships, volcanic ashes, etc., in just that one hideous\nconfiguration of positions. France had to be a nation and colonize\nMartinique. Our country had to exist and send our ships there. IF God\naimed at just that result, the means by which the centuries bent their\ninfluences towards it, showed exquisite intelligence. And so of any\nstate of things whatever, either in nature or in history, which we\nfind actually realized. For the parts of things must always make SOME\ndefinite resultant, be it chaotic or harmonious. When we look at what\nhas actually come, the conditions must always appear perfectly designed\nto ensure it. We can always say, therefore, in any conceivable world, of\nany conceivable character, that the whole cosmic machinery MAY have been\ndesigned to produce it.\nPragmatically, then, the abstract word 'design' is a blank cartridge. It\ncarries no consequences, it does no execution. What sort of design? and\nwhat sort of a designer? are the only serious questions, and the study\nof facts is the only way of getting even approximate answers. Meanwhile,\npending the slow answer from facts, anyone who insists that there is a\ndesigner and who is sure he is a divine one, gets a certain pragmatic\nbenefit from the term--the same, in fact which we saw that the terms\nGod, Spirit, or the Absolute, yield us 'Design,' worthless tho it be\nas a mere rationalistic principle set above or behind things for our\nadmiration, becomes, if our faith concretes it into something theistic,\na term of PROMISE. Returning with it into experience, we gain a more\nconfiding outlook on the future. If not a blind force but a seeing\nforce runs things, we may reasonably expect better issues. This vague\nconfidence in the future is the sole pragmatic meaning at present\ndiscernible in the terms design and designer. But if cosmic confidence\nis right not wrong, better not worse, that is a most important meaning.\nThat much at least of possible 'truth' the terms will then have in them.\nLet me take up another well-worn controversy, THE FREE-WILL PROBLEM.\nMost persons who believe in what is called their free-will do so after\nthe rationalistic fashion. It is a principle, a positive faculty or\nvirtue added to man, by which his dignity is enigmatically augmented. He\nought to believe it for this reason. Determinists, who deny it, who say\nthat individual men originate nothing, but merely transmit to the\nfuture the whole push of the past cosmos of which they are so small\nan expression, diminish man. He is less admirable, stripped of this\ncreative principle. I imagine that more than half of you share our\ninstinctive belief in free-will, and that admiration of it as a\nprinciple of dignity has much to do with your fidelity.\nBut free-will has also been discussed pragmatically, and, strangely\nenough, the same pragmatic interpretation has been put upon it by both\ndisputants. You know how large a part questions of ACCOUNTABILITY have\nplayed in ethical controversy. To hear some persons, one would suppose\nthat all that ethics aims at is a code of merits and demerits. Thus does\nthe old legal and theological leaven, the interest in crime and sin and\npunishment abide with us. 'Who's to blame? whom can we punish? whom\nwill God punish?'--these preoccupations hang like a bad dream over man's\nreligious history.\nSo both free-will and determinism have been inveighed against and called\nabsurd, because each, in the eyes of its enemies, has seemed to prevent\nthe 'imputability' of good or bad deeds to their authors. Queer antinomy\nthis! Free-will means novelty, the grafting on to the past of something\nnot involved therein. If our acts were predetermined, if we merely\ntransmitted the push of the whole past, the free-willists say, how could\nwe be praised or blamed for anything? We should be 'agents' only, not\n'principals,' and where then would be our precious imputability and\nresponsibility?\nBut where would it be if we HAD free-will? rejoin the determinists. If a\n'free' act be a sheer novelty, that comes not FROM me, the previous\nme, but ex nihilo, and simply tacks itself on to me, how can _I_, the\nprevious I, be responsible? How can I have any permanent CHARACTER that\nwill stand still long enough for praise or blame to be awarded? The\nchaplet of my days tumbles into a cast of disconnected beads as soon\nas the thread of inner necessity is drawn out by the preposterous\nindeterminist doctrine. Messrs. Fullerton and McTaggart have recently\nlaid about them doughtily with this argument.\nIt may be good ad hominem, but otherwise it is pitiful. For I ask you,\nquite apart from other reasons, whether any man, woman or child, with a\nsense for realities, ought not to be ashamed to plead such principles\nas either dignity or imputability. Instinct and utility between them\ncan safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and\npraise. If a man does good acts we shall praise him, if he does bad acts\nwe shall punish him--anyhow, and quite apart from theories as to whether\nthe acts result from what was previous in him or are novelties in a\nstrict sense. To make our human ethics revolve about the question of\n'merit' is a piteous unreality--God alone can know our merits, if we\nhave any. The real ground for supposing free-will is indeed pragmatic,\nbut it has nothing to do with this contemptible right to punish which\nhad made such a noise in past discussions of the subject.\nFree-will pragmatically means NOVELTIES IN THE WORLD, the right to\nexpect that in its deepest elements as well as in its surface phenomena,\nthe future may not identically repeat and imitate the past. That\nimitation en masse is there, who can deny? The general 'uniformity\nof nature' is presupposed by every lesser law. But nature may be only\napproximately uniform; and persons in whom knowledge of the world's past\nhas bred pessimism (or doubts as to the world's good character, which\nbecome certainties if that character be supposed eternally fixed) may\nnaturally welcome free-will as a MELIORISTIC doctrine. It holds up\nimprovement as at least possible; whereas determinism assures us that\nour whole notion of possibility is born of human ignorance, and that\nnecessity and impossibility between them rule the destinies of the\nworld.\nFree-will is thus a general cosmological theory of PROMISE, just like\nthe Absolute, God, Spirit or Design. Taken abstractly, no one of these\nterms has any inner content, none of them gives us any picture, and\nno one of them would retain the least pragmatic value in a world\nwhose character was obviously perfect from the start. Elation at mere\nexistence, pure cosmic emotion and delight, would, it seems to me,\nquench all interest in those speculations, if the world were nothing but\na lubberland of happiness already. Our interest in religious metaphysics\narises in the fact that our empirical future feels to us unsafe, and\nneeds some higher guarantee. If the past and present were purely good,\nwho could wish that the future might possibly not resemble them? Who\ncould desire free-will? Who would not say, with Huxley, \"let me be wound\nup every day like a watch, to go right fatally, and I ask no better\nfreedom.\" 'Freedom' in a world already perfect could only mean\nfreedom to BE WORSE, and who could be so insane as to wish that? To be\nnecessarily what it is, to be impossibly aught else, would put the\nlast touch of perfection upon optimism's universe. Surely the only\nPOSSIBILITY that one can rationally claim is the possibility that things\nmay be BETTER. That possibility, I need hardly say, is one that, as the\nactual world goes, we have ample grounds for desiderating.\nFree-will thus has no meaning unless it be a doctrine of RELIEF. As\nsuch, it takes its place with other religious doctrines. Between them,\nthey build up the old wastes and repair the former desolations. Our\nspirit, shut within this courtyard of sense-experience, is always saying\nto the intellect upon the tower: 'Watchman, tell us of the night, if it\naught of promise bear,' and the intellect gives it then these terms of\npromise.\nOther than this practical significance, the words God, free-will,\ndesign, etc., have none. Yet dark tho they be in themselves, or\nintellectualistically taken, when we bear them into life's thicket with\nus the darkness THERE grows light about us. If you stop, in dealing with\nsuch words, with their definition, thinking that to be an intellectual\nfinality, where are you? Stupidly staring at a pretentious sham! \"Deus\nest Ens, a se, extra et supra omne genus, necessarium, unum, infinite\nperfectum, simplex, immutabile, immensum, aeternum, intelligens,\"\netc.,--wherein is such a definition really instructive? It means less,\nthan nothing, in its pompous robe of adjectives. Pragmatism alone can\nread a positive meaning into it, and for that she turns her back upon\nthe intellectualist point of view altogether. 'God's in his heaven;\nall's right with the world!'--THAT'S the heart of your theology, and for\nthat you need no rationalist definitions.\nWhy shouldn't we all of us, rationalists as well as pragmatists, confess\nthis? Pragmatism, so far from keeping her eyes bent on the immediate\npractical foreground, as she is accused of doing, dwells just as much\nupon the world's remotest perspectives.\nSee then how all these ultimate questions turn, as it were, up\ntheir hinges; and from looking backwards upon principles, upon an\nerkenntnisstheoretische Ich, a God, a Kausalitaetsprinzip, a Design, a\nFree-will, taken in themselves, as something august and exalted above\nfacts,--see, I say, how pragmatism shifts the emphasis and looks forward\ninto facts themselves. The really vital question for us all is, What is\nthis world going to be? What is life eventually to make of itself? The\ncentre of gravity of philosophy must therefore alter its place. The\nearth of things, long thrown into shadow by the glories of the upper\nether, must resume its rights. To shift the emphasis in this way means\nthat philosophic questions will fall to be treated by minds of a\nless abstractionist type than heretofore, minds more scientific and\nindividualistic in their tone yet not irreligious either. It will be\nan alteration in 'the seat of authority' that reminds one almost of the\nprotestant reformation. And as, to papal minds, protestantism has\noften seemed a mere mess of anarchy and confusion, such, no doubt, will\npragmatism often seem to ultra-rationalist minds in philosophy. It will\nseem so much sheer trash, philosophically. But life wags on, all the\nsame, and compasses its ends, in protestant countries. I venture to\nthink that philosophic protestantism will compass a not dissimilar\nprosperity.\nLecture IV\nThe One and the Many\nWe saw in the last lecture that the pragmatic method, in its dealings\nwith certain concepts, instead of ending with admiring contemplation,\nplunges forward into the river of experience with them and prolongs the\nperspective by their means. Design, free-will, the absolute mind, spirit\ninstead of matter, have for their sole meaning a better promise as to\nthis world's outcome. Be they false or be they true, the meaning of them\nis this meliorism. I have sometimes thought of the phenomenon called\n'total reflexion' in optics as a good symbol of the relation between\nabstract ideas and concrete realities, as pragmatism conceives it. Hold\na tumbler of water a little above your eyes and look up through the\nwater at its surface--or better still look similarly through the flat\nwall of an aquarium. You will then see an extraordinarily brilliant\nreflected image say of a candle-flame, or any other clear object,\nsituated on the opposite side of the vessel. No candle-ray, under these\ncircumstances gets beyond the water's surface: every ray is totally\nreflected back into the depths again. Now let the water represent the\nworld of sensible facts, and let the air above it represent the world of\nabstract ideas. Both worlds are real, of course, and interact; but they\ninteract only at their boundary, and the locus of everything that lives,\nand happens to us, so far as full experience goes, is the water. We are\nlike fishes swimming in the sea of sense, bounded above by the superior\nelement, but unable to breathe it pure or penetrate it. We get our\noxygen from it, however, we touch it incessantly, now in this part, now\nin that, and every time we touch it we are reflected back into the water\nwith our course re-determined and re-energized. The abstract ideas of\nwhich the air consists, indispensable for life, but irrespirable by\nthemselves, as it were, and only active in their re-directing function.\nAll similes are halting but this one rather takes my fancy. It shows\nhow something, not sufficient for life in itself, may nevertheless be an\neffective determinant of life elsewhere.\nIn this present hour I wish to illustrate the pragmatic method by one\nmore application. I wish to turn its light upon the ancient problem\nof 'the one and the many.' I suspect that in but few of you has this\nproblem occasioned sleepless nights, and I should not be astonished if\nsome of you told me it had never vexed you. I myself have come, by long\nbrooding over it, to consider it the most central of all philosophic\nproblems, central because so pregnant. I mean by this that if you know\nwhether a man is a decided monist or a decided pluralist, you perhaps\nknow more about the rest of his opinions than if you give him any other\nname ending in IST. To believe in the one or in the many, that is the\nclassification with the maximum number of consequences. So bear with\nme for an hour while I try to inspire you with my own interest in the\nproblem.\nPhilosophy has often been defined as the quest or the vision of the\nworld's unity. We never hear this definition challenged, and it is true\nas far as it goes, for philosophy has indeed manifested above all things\nits interest in unity. But how about the VARIETY in things? Is that such\nan irrelevant matter? If instead of using the term philosophy, we talk\nin general of our intellect and its needs we quickly see that unity\nis only one of these. Acquaintance with the details of fact is always\nreckoned, along with their reduction to system, as an indispensable\nmark of mental greatness. Your 'scholarly' mind, of encyclopedic,\nphilological type, your man essentially of learning, has never lacked\nfor praise along with your philosopher. What our intellect really aims\nat is neither variety nor unity taken singly but totality.[Footnote:\nCompare A. Bellanger: Les concepts de Cause, et l'activite intentionelle\nde l'Esprit. Paris, Alcan, 1905, p. 79 ff.] In this, acquaintance with\nreality's diversities is as important as understanding their connexion.\nThe human passion of curiosity runs on all fours with the systematizing\npassion.\nIn spite of this obvious fact the unity of things has always been\nconsidered more illustrious, as it were, than their variety. When a\nyoung man first conceives the notion that the whole world forms\none great fact, with all its parts moving abreast, as it were, and\ninterlocked, he feels as if he were enjoying a great insight, and looks\nsuperciliously on all who still fall short of this sublime conception.\nTaken thus abstractly as it first comes to one, the monistic insight is\nso vague as hardly to seem worth defending intellectually. Yet probably\neveryone in this audience in some way cherishes it. A certain abstract\nmonism, a certain emotional response to the character of oneness, as\nif it were a feature of the world not coordinate with its manyness, but\nvastly more excellent and eminent, is so prevalent in educated circles\nthat we might almost call it a part of philosophic common sense. Of\nCOURSE the world is one, we say. How else could it be a world at all?\nEmpiricists as a rule, are as stout monists of this abstract kind as\nrationalists are.\nThe difference is that the empiricists are less dazzled. Unity doesn't\nblind them to everything else, doesn't quench their curiosity for\nspecial facts, whereas there is a kind of rationalist who is sure to\ninterpret abstract unity mystically and to forget everything else, to\ntreat it as a principle; to admire and worship it; and thereupon to come\nto a full stop intellectually.\n'The world is One!'--the formula may become a sort of number-worship.\n'Three' and 'seven' have, it is true, been reckoned sacred numbers; but,\nabstractly taken, why is 'one' more excellent than 'forty-three,'\nor than 'two million and ten'? In this first vague conviction of the\nworld's unity, there is so little to take hold of that we hardly know\nwhat we mean by it.\nThe only way to get forward with our notion is to treat it\npragmatically. Granting the oneness to exist, what facts will be\ndifferent in consequence? What will the unity be known-as? The world is\none--yes, but HOW one? What is the practical value of the oneness for\nUS?\nAsking such questions, we pass from the vague to the definite, from the\nabstract to the concrete. Many distinct ways in which oneness predicated\nof the universe might make a difference, come to view. I will note\nsuccessively the more obvious of these ways.\n1. First, the world is at least ONE SUBJECT OF DISCOURSE. If its\nmanyness were so irremediable as to permit NO union whatever of it\nparts, not even our minds could 'mean' the whole of it at once: the\nwould be like eyes trying to look in opposite directions. But in point\nof fact we mean to cover the whole of it by our abstract term 'world' or\n'universe,' which expressly intends that no part shall be left out. Such\nunity of discourse carries obviously no farther monistic specifications.\nA 'chaos,' once so named, has as much unity of discourse as a cosmos.\nIt is an odd fact that many monists consider a great victory scored for\ntheir side when pluralists say 'the universe is many.' \"'The universe'!\"\nthey chuckle--\"his speech bewrayeth him. He stands confessed of monism\nout of his own mouth.\" Well, let things be one in that sense! You can\nthen fling such a word as universe at the whole collection of them, but\nwhat matters it? It still remains to be ascertained whether they are one\nin any other sense that is more valuable.\n2. Are they, for example, CONTINUOUS? Can you pass from one to another,\nkeeping always in your one universe without any danger of falling out?\nIn other words, do the parts of our universe HANG together, instead of\nbeing like detached grains of sand?\nEven grains of sand hang together through the space in which they are\nembedded, and if you can in any way move through such space, you can\npass continuously from number one of them to number two. Space and\ntime are thus vehicles of continuity, by which the world's parts hang\ntogether. The practical difference to us, resultant from these forms of\nunion, is immense. Our whole motor life is based upon them.\n3. There are innumerable other paths of practical continuity among\nthings. Lines of INFLUENCE can be traced by which they together.\nFollowing any such line you pass from one thing to another till you\nmay have covered a good part of the universe's extent. Gravity and\nheat-conduction are such all-uniting influences, so far as the physical\nworld goes. Electric, luminous and chemical influences follow similar\nlines of influence. But opaque and inert bodies interrupt the continuity\nhere, so that you have to step round them, or change your mode of\nprogress if you wish to get farther on that day. Practically, you have\nthen lost your universe's unity, SO FAR AS IT WAS CONSTITUTED BY THOSE\nFIRST LINES OF INFLUENCE. There are innumerable kinds of connexion that\nspecial things have with other special things; and the ENSEMBLE of any\none of these connexions forms one sort of system by which things are\nconjoined. Thus men are conjoined in a vast network of ACQUAINTANCESHIP.\nBrown knows Jones, Jones knows Robinson, etc.; and BY CHOOSING YOUR\nFARTHER INTERMEDIARIES RIGHTLY you may carry a message from Jones to the\nEmpress of China, or the Chief of the African Pigmies, or to anyone\nelse in the inhabited world. But you are stopped short, as by a\nnon-conductor, when you choose one man wrong in this experiment. What\nmay be called love-systems are grafted on the acquaintance-system. A\nloves (or hates) B; B loves (or hates) C, etc. But these systems are\nsmaller than the great acquaintance-system that they presuppose.\nHuman efforts are daily unifying the world more and more in definite\nsystematic ways. We found colonial, postal, consular, commercial\nsystems, all the parts of which obey definite influences that propagate\nthemselves within the system but not to facts outside of it. The result\nis innumerable little hangings-together of the world's parts within the\nlarger hangings-together, little worlds, not only of discourse but of\noperation, within the wider universe. Each system exemplifies one type\nor grade of union, its parts being strung on that peculiar kind of\nrelation, and the same part may figure in many different systems, as\na man may hold several offices and belong to various clubs. From this\n'systematic' point of view, therefore, the pragmatic value of the\nworld's unity is that all these definite networks actually and\npractically exist. Some are more enveloping and extensive, some less so;\nthey are superposed upon each other; and between them all they let no\nindividual elementary part of the universe escape. Enormous as is the\namount of disconnexion among things (for these systematic influences and\nconjunctions follow rigidly exclusive paths), everything that exists is\ninfluenced in SOME way by something else, if you can only pick the way\nout rightly Loosely speaking, and in general, it may be said that all\nthings cohere and adhere to each other SOMEHOW, and that the universe\nexists practically in reticulated or concatenated forms which make of\nit a continuous or 'integrated' affair. Any kind of influence whatever\nhelps to make the world one, so far as you can follow it from next\nto next. You may then say that 'the world IS One'--meaning in these\nrespects, namely, and just so far as they obtain. But just as definitely\nis it NOT one, so far as they do not obtain; and there is no species of\nconnexion which will not fail, if, instead of choosing conductors for\nit, you choose non-conductors. You are then arrested at your very\nfirst step and have to write the world down as a pure MANY from that\nparticular point of view. If our intellect had been as much interested\nin disjunctive as it is in conjunctive relations, philosophy would have\nequally successfully celebrated the world's DISUNION.\nThe great point is to notice that the oneness and the manyness are\nabsolutely co-ordinate here. Neither is primordial or more essential or\nexcellent than the other. Just as with space, whose separating of things\nseems exactly on a par with its uniting of them, but sometimes one\nfunction and sometimes the other is what come home to us most, so,\nin our general dealings with the world of influences, we now need\nconductors and now need non-conductors, and wisdom lies in knowing which\nis which at the appropriate moment.\n4. All these systems of influence or non-influence may be listed under\nthe general problem of the world's CAUSAL UNITY. If the minor causal\ninfluences among things should converge towards one common causal origin\nof them in the past, one great first cause for all that is, one might\nthen speak of the absolute causal unity of the world. God's fiat on\ncreation's day has figured in traditional philosophy as such an absolute\ncause and origin. Transcendental Idealism, translating 'creation' into\n'thinking' (or 'willing to' think') calls the divine act 'eternal'\nrather than 'first'; but the union of the many here is absolute, just\nthe same--the many would not BE, save for the One. Against this notion\nof the unity of origin of all there has always stood the pluralistic\nnotion of an eternal self-existing many in the shape of atoms or even of\nspiritual units of some sort. The alternative has doubtless a pragmatic\nmeaning, but perhaps, as far as these lectures go, we had better leave\nthe question of unity of origin unsettled.\n5. The most important sort of union that obtains among things,\npragmatically speaking, is their GENERIC UNITY. Things exist in kinds,\nthere are many specimens in each kind, and what the 'kind' implies for\none specimen, it implies also for every other specimen of that kind. We\ncan easily conceive that every fact in the world might be singular,\nthat is, unlike any other fact and sole of its kind. In such a world of\nsingulars our logic would be useless, for logic works by predicating\nof the single instance what is true of all its kind. With no two\nthings alike in the world, we should be unable to reason from our past\nexperiences to our future ones. The existence of so much generic unity\nin things is thus perhaps the most momentous pragmatic specification of\nwhat it may mean to say 'the world is One.' ABSOLUTE generic unity would\nobtain if there were one summum genus under which all things without\nexception could be eventually subsumed. 'Beings,' 'thinkables,'\n'experiences,' would be candidates for this position. Whether the\nalternatives expressed by such words have any pragmatic significance or\nnot, is another question which I prefer to leave unsettled just now.\n6. Another specification of what the phrase 'the world is One' may mean\nis UNITY OF PURPOSE. An enormous number of things in the world subserve\na common purpose. All the man-made systems, administrative, industrial,\nmilitary, or what not, exist each for its controlling purpose. Every\nliving being pursues its own peculiar purposes. They co-operate,\naccording to the degree of their development, in collective or tribal\npurposes, larger ends thus enveloping lesser ones, until an absolutely\nsingle, final and climacteric purpose subserved by all things without\nexception might conceivably be reached. It is needless to say that the\nappearances conflict with such a view. Any resultant, as I said in\nmy third lecture, MAY have been purposed in advance, but none of the\nresults we actually know in is world have in point of fact been purposed\nin advance in all their details. Men and nations start with a vague\nnotion of being rich, or great, or good. Each step they make brings\nunforeseen chances into sight, and shuts out older vistas, and the\nspecifications of the general purpose have to be daily changed. What is\nreached in the end may be better or worse than what was proposed, but it\nis always more complex and different.\nOur different purposes also are at war with each other. Where one can't\ncrush the other out, they compromise; and the result is again different\nfrom what anyone distinctly proposed beforehand. Vaguely and generally,\nmuch of what was purposed may be gained; but everything makes strongly\nfor the view that our world is incompletely unified teleologically and\nis still trying to get its unification better organized.\nWhoever claims ABSOLUTE teleological unity, saying that there is one\npurpose that every detail of the universe subserves, dogmatizes at\nhis own risk. Theologians who dogmalize thus find it more and more\nimpossible, as our acquaintance with the warring interests of the\nworld's parts grows more concrete, to imagine what the one climacteric\npurpose may possibly be like. We see indeed that certain evils minister\nto ulterior goods, that the bitter makes the cocktail better, and that\na bit of danger or hardship puts us agreeably to our trumps. We can\nvaguely generalize this into the doctrine that all the evil in the\nuniverse is but instrumental to its greater perfection. But the scale\nof the evil actually in sight defies all human tolerance; and\ntranscendental idealism, in the pages of a Bradley or a Royce, brings us\nno farther than the book of Job did--God's ways are not our ways, so let\nus put our hands upon our mouth. A God who can relish such superfluities\nof horror is no God for human beings to appeal to. His animal spirits\nare too high. In other words the 'Absolute' with his one purpose, is not\nthe man-like God of common people.\n7. AESTHETIC UNION among things also obtains, and is very analogous to\nideological union. Things tell a story. Their parts hang together so as\nto work out a climax. They play into each other's hands expressively.\nRetrospectively, we can see that altho no definite purpose presided\nover a chain of events, yet the events fell into a dramatic form, with\na start, a middle, and a finish. In point of fact all stories end; and\nhere again the point of view of a many is that more natural one to take.\nThe world is full of partial stories that run parallel to one another,\nbeginning and ending at odd times. They mutually interlace and interfere\nat points, but we cannot unify them completely in our minds. In\nfollowing your life-history, I must temporarily turn my attention from\nmy own. Even a biographer of twins would have to press them alternately\nupon his reader's attention.\nIt follows that whoever says that the whole world tells one story utters\nanother of those monistic dogmas that a man believes at his risk. It is\neasy to see the world's history pluralistically, as a rope of which each\nfibre tells a separate tale; but to conceive of each cross-section of\nthe rope as an absolutely single fact, and to sum the whole longitudinal\nseries into one being living an undivided life, is harder. We have\nindeed the analogy of embryology to help us. The microscopist makes a\nhundred flat cross-sections of a given embryo, and mentally unites them\ninto one solid whole. But the great world's ingredients, so far as\nthey are beings, seem, like the rope's fibres, to be discontinuous\ncross-wise, and to cohere only in the longitudinal direction. Followed\nin that direction they are many. Even the embryologist, when he follows\nthe DEVELOPMENT of his object, has to treat the history of each single\norgan in turn. ABSOLUTE aesthetic union is thus another barely abstract\nideal. The world appears as something more epic than dramatic.\nSo far, then, we see how the world is unified by its many systems,\nkinds, purposes, and dramas. That there is more union in all these ways\nthan openly appears is certainly true. That there MAY be one sovereign\npurpose, system, kind, and story, is a legitimate hypothesis. All I\nsay here is that it is rash to affirm this dogmatically without better\nevidence than we possess at present.\n8. The GREAT monistic DENKMITTEL for a hundred years past has been\nthe notion of THE ONE KNOWER. The many exist only as objects for his\nthought--exist in his dream, as it were; and AS HE KNOWS them, they have\none purpose, form one system, tell one tale for him. This notion of an\nALL-ENVELOPING NOETIC UNITY in things is the sublimest achievement of\nintellectualist philosophy. Those who believe in the Absolute, as the\nall-knower is termed, usually say that they do so for coercive reasons,\nwhich clear thinkers cannot evade. The Absolute has far-reaching\npractical consequences, some of which I drew attention in my second\nlecture. Many kinds of difference important to us would surely follow\nfrom its being true. I cannot here enter into all the logical proofs of\nsuch a Being's existence, farther than to say that none of them seem to\nme sound. I must therefore treat the notion of an All-Knower simply as\nan hypothesis, exactly on a par logically with the pluralist notion that\nthere is no point of view, no focus of information extant, from\nwhich the entire content of the universe is visible at once. \"God's\nconsciousness,\" says Professor Royce,[Footnote: The Conception of\nGod, New York, 1897, p. 292.] \"forms in its wholeness one luminously\ntransparent conscious moment\"--this is the type of noetic unity on which\nrationalism insists. Empiricism on the other hand is satisfied with the\ntype of noetic unity that is humanly familiar. Everything gets known by\nSOME knower along with something else; but the knowers may in the end be\nirreducibly many, and the greatest knower of them all may yet not know\nthe whole of everything, or even know what he does know at one single\nstroke:--he may be liable to forget. Whichever type obtained, the world\nwould still be a universe noetically. Its parts would be conjoined\nby knowledge, but in the one case the knowledge would be absolutely\nunified, in the other it would be strung along and overlapped.\nThe notion of one instantaneous or eternal Knower--either adjective\nhere means the same thing--is, as I said, the great intellectualist\nachievement of our time. It has practically driven out that conception\nof 'Substance' which earlier philosophers set such store by, and by\nwhich so much unifying work used to be done--universal substance which\nalone has being in and from itself, and of which all the particulars\nof experience are but forms to which it gives support. Substance has\nsuccumbed to the pragmatic criticisms of the English school. It appears\nnow only as another name for the fact that phenomena as they come are\nactually grouped and given in coherent forms, the very forms in which\nwe finite knowers experience or think them together. These forms of\nconjunction are as much parts of the tissue of experience as are the\nterms which they connect; and it is a great pragmatic achievement for\nrecent idealism to have made the world hang together in these directly\nrepresentable ways instead of drawing its unity from the 'inherence' of\nits parts--whatever that may mean--in an unimaginable principle behind\nthe scenes.\n'The world is one,' therefore, just so far as we experience it to be\nconcatenated, one by as many definite conjunctions as appear. But then\nalso NOT one by just as many definite DISjunctions as we find. The\noneness and the manyness of it thus obtain in respects which can\nbe separately named. It is neither a universe pure and simple nor\na multiverse pure and simple. And its various manners of being one\nsuggest, for their accurate ascertainment, so many distinct programs\nof scientific work. Thus the pragmatic question 'What is the oneness\nknown-as? What practical difference will it make?' saves us from all\nfeverish excitement over it as a principle of sublimity and carries us\nforward into the stream of experience with a cool head. The stream may\nindeed reveal far more connexion and union than we now suspect, but we\nare not entitled on pragmatic principles to claim absolute oneness in\nany respect in advance.\nIt is so difficult to see definitely what absolute oneness can mean,\nthat probably the majority of you are satisfied with the sober attitude\nwhich we have reached. Nevertheless there are possibly some radically\nmonistic souls among you who are not content to leave the one and the\nmany on a par. Union of various grades, union of diverse types, union\nthat stops at non-conductors, union that merely goes from next to next,\nand means in many cases outer nextness only, and not a more internal\nbond, union of concatenation, in short; all that sort of thing seems to\nyou a halfway stage of thought. The oneness of things, superior to their\nmanyness, you think must also be more deeply true, must be the more\nreal aspect of the world. The pragmatic view, you are sure, gives us\na universe imperfectly rational. The real universe must form an\nunconditional unit of being, something consolidated, with its parts\nco-implicated through and through. Only then could we consider our\nestate completely rational. There is no doubt whatever that this\nultra-monistic way of thinking means a great deal to many minds. \"One\nLife, One Truth, one Love, one Principle, One Good, One God\"--I quote\nfrom a Christian Science leaflet which the day's mail brings into my\nhands--beyond doubt such a confession of faith has pragmatically an\nemotional value, and beyond doubt the word 'one' contributes to the\nvalue quite as much as the other words. But if we try to realize\nINTELLECTUALLY what we can possibly MEAN by such a glut of oneness we\nare thrown right back upon our pragmatistic determinations again. It\nmeans either the mere name One, the universe of discourse; or it means\nthe sum total of all the ascertainable particular conjunctions and\nconcatenations; or, finally, it means some one vehicle of conjunction\ntreated as all-inclusive, like one origin, one purpose, or one knower.\nIn point of fact it always means one KNOWER to those who take it\nintellectually to-day. The one knower involves, they think, the other\nforms of conjunction. His world must have all its parts co-implicated\nin the one logical-aesthetical-teleological unit-picture which is his\neternal dream.\nThe character of the absolute knower's picture is however so impossible\nfor us to represent clearly, that we may fairly suppose that the\nauthority which absolute monism undoubtedly possesses, and probably\nalways will possess over some persons, draws its strength far less from\nintellectual than from mystical grounds. To interpret absolute monism\nworthily, be a mystic. Mystical states of mind in every degree are shown\nby history, usually tho not always, to make for the monistic view. This\nis no proper occasion to enter upon the general subject of mysticism,\nbut I will quote one mystical pronouncement to show just what I mean.\nThe paragon of all monistic systems is the Vedanta philosophy of\nHindostan, and the paragon of Vedantist missionaries was the late\nSwami Vivekananda who visited our shores some years ago. The method of\nVedantism is the mystical method. You do not reason, but after going\nthrough a certain discipline YOU SEE, and having seen, you can report\nthe truth. Vivekananda thus reports the truth in one of his lectures\nhere:\n\"Where is any more misery for him who sees this Oneness in the\nUniverse...this Oneness of life, Oneness of everything? ...This\nseparation between man and man, man and woman, man and child, nation\nfrom nation, earth from moon, moon from sun, this separation between\natom and atom is the cause really of all the misery, and the Vedanta\nsays this separation does not exist, it is not real. It is merely\napparent, on the surface. In the heart of things there is Unity still.\nIf you go inside you find that Unity between man and man, women and\nchildren, races and races, high and low, rich and poor, the gods and\nmen: all are One, and animals too, if you go deep enough, and he who has\nattained to that has no more delusion. ... Where is any more delusion\nfor him? What can delude him? He knows the reality of everything, the\nsecret of everything. Where is there any more misery for him? What does\nhe desire? He has traced the reality of everything unto the Lord, that\ncentre, that Unity of everything, and that is Eternal Bliss, Eternal\nKnowledge, Eternal Existence. Neither death nor disease, nor sorrow nor\nmisery, nor discontent is there ... in the centre, the reality, there\nis no one to be mourned for, no one to be sorry for. He has penetrated\neverything, the Pure One, the Formless, the Bodiless, the Stainless, He\nthe Knower, He the Great Poet, the Self-Existent, He who is giving to\neveryone what he deserves.\"\nObserve how radical the character of the monism here is. Separation is\nnot simply overcome by the One, it is denied to exist. There is no many.\nWe are not parts of the One; It has no parts; and since in a sense we\nundeniably ARE, it must be that each of us is the One, indivisibly and\ntotally. AN ABSOLUTE ONE, AND I THAT ONE--surely we have here a religion\nwhich, emotionally considered, has a high pragmatic value; it imparts a\nperfect sumptuosity of security. As our Swami says in another place:\n\"When man has seen himself as one with the infinite Being of the\nuniverse, when all separateness has ceased, when all men, all women, all\nangels, all gods, all animals, all plants, the whole universe has been\nmelted into that oneness, then all fear disappears. Whom to fear? Can\nI hurt myself? Can I kill myself? Can I injure myself? Do you fear\nyourself? Then will all sorrow disappear. What can cause me sorrow? I am\nthe One Existence of the universe. Then all jealousies will disappear;\nof whom to be jealous? Of myself? Then all bad feelings disappear.\nAgainst whom will I have this bad feeling? Against myself? There is none\nin the universe but me. ... Kill out this differentiation; kill out this\nsuperstition that there are many. 'He who, in this world of many, sees\nthat One; he who in this mass of insentiency sees that One Sentient\nBeing; he who in this world of shadow catches that Reality, unto him\nbelongs eternal peace, unto none else, unto none else.'\"\nWe all have some ear for this monistic music: it elevates and reassures.\nWe all have at least the germ of mysticism in us. And when our idealists\nrecite their arguments for the Absolute, saying that the slightest union\nadmitted anywhere carries logically absolute Oneness with it, and that\nthe slightest separation admitted anywhere logically carries disunion\nremediless and complete, I cannot help suspecting that the palpable weak\nplaces in the intellectual reasonings they use are protected from their\nown criticism by a mystical feeling that, logic or no logic, absolute\nOneness must somehow at any cost be true. Oneness overcomes MORAL\nseparateness at any rate. In the passion of love we have the mystic germ\nof what might mean a total union of all sentient life. This mystical\ngerm wakes up in us on hearing the monistic utterances, acknowledges\ntheir authority, and assigns to intellectual considerations a secondary\nplace.\nI will dwell no longer on these religious and moral aspects of the\nquestion in this lecture. When I come to my final lecture there will be\nsomething more to say.\nLeave then out of consideration for the moment the authority which\nmystical insights may be conjectured eventually to possess; treat the\nproblem of the One and the Many in a purely intellectual way; and we\nsee clearly enough where pragmatism stands. With her criterion of the\npractical differences that theories make, we see that she must equally\nabjure absolute monism and absolute pluralism. The world is one just\nso far as its parts hang together by any definite connexion. It is many\njust so far as any definite connexion fails to obtain. And finally it\nis growing more and more unified by those systems of connexion at least\nwhich human energy keeps framing as time goes on.\nIt is possible to imagine alternative universes to the one we know, in\nwhich the most various grades and types of union should be embodied.\nThus the lowest grade of universe would be a world of mere WITHNESS, of\nwhich the parts were only strung together by the conjunction 'and.' Such\na universe is even now the collection of our several inner lives. The\nspaces and times of your imagination, the objects and events of your\nday-dreams are not only more or less incoherent inter se, but are wholly\nout of definite relation with the similar contents of anyone else's\nmind. Our various reveries now as we sit here compenetrate each other\nidly without influencing or interfering. They coexist, but in no order\nand in no receptacle, being the nearest approach to an absolute 'many'\nthat we can conceive. We cannot even imagine any reason why they SHOULD\nbe known all together, and we can imagine even less, if they were known\ntogether, how they could be known as one systematic whole.\nBut add our sensations and bodily actions, and the union mounts to\na much higher grade. Our audita et visa and our acts fall into those\nreceptacles of time and space in which each event finds its date and\nplace. They form 'things' and are of 'kinds' too, and can be classed.\nYet we can imagine a world of things and of kinds in which the causal\ninteractions with which we are so familiar should not exist. Everything\nthere might be inert towards everything else, and refuse to propagate\nits influence. Or gross mechanical influences might pass, but no\nchemical action. Such worlds would be far less unified than ours. Again\nthere might be complete physico-chemical interaction, but no minds; or\nminds, but altogether private ones, with no social life; or social\nlife limited to acquaintance, but no love; or love, but no customs\nor institutions that should systematize it. No one of these grades of\nuniverse would be absolutely irrational or disintegrated, inferior tho\nit might appear when looked at from the higher grades. For instance, if\nour minds should ever become 'telepathically' connected, so that we knew\nimmediately, or could under certain conditions know immediately, each\nwhat the other was thinking, the world we now live in would appear to\nthe thinkers in that world to have been of an inferior grade.\nWith the whole of past eternity open for our conjectures to range in, it\nmay be lawful to wonder whether the various kinds of union now realized\nin the universe that we inhabit may not possibly have been successively\nevolved after the fashion in which we now see human systems evolving in\nconsequence of human needs. If such an hypothesis were legitimate, total\noneness would appear at the end of things rather than at their origin.\nIn other words the notion of the 'Absolute' would have to be replaced by\nthat of the 'Ultimate.' The two notions would have the same content--the\nmaximally unified content of fact, namely--but their time-relations\nwould be positively reversed. [Footnote: Compare on the Ultimate,\nMr. Schiller's essay \"Activity and Substance,\" in his book entitled\nHumanism, p. 204.]\nAfter discussing the unity of the universe in this pragmatic way, you\nought to see why I said in my second lecture, borrowing the word from my\nfriend G. Papini, that pragmatism tends to UNSTIFFEN all our theories.\nThe world's oneness has generally been affirmed abstractly only, and as\nif anyone who questioned it must be an idiot. The temper of monists has\nbeen so vehement, as almost at times to be convulsive; and this way of\nholding a doctrine does not easily go with reasonable discussion and the\ndrawing of distinctions. The theory of the Absolute, in particular, has\nhad to be an article of faith, affirmed dogmatically and exclusively.\nThe One and All, first in the order of being and of knowing, logically\nnecessary itself, and uniting all lesser things in the bonds of mutual\nnecessity, how could it allow of any mitigation of its inner\nrigidity? The slightest suspicion of pluralism, the minutest wiggle of\nindependence of any one of its parts from the control of the totality,\nwould ruin it. Absolute unity brooks no degrees--as well might you claim\nabsolute purity for a glass of water because it contains but a single\nlittle cholera-germ. The independence, however infinitesimal, of a part,\nhowever small, would be to the Absolute as fatal as a cholera-germ.\nPluralism on the other hand has no need of this dogmatic rigoristic\ntemper. Provided you grant SOME separation among things, some tremor of\nindependence, some free play of parts on one another, some real novelty\nor chance, however minute, she is amply satisfied, and will allow you\nany amount, however great, of real union. How much of union there may\nbe is a question that she thinks can only be decided empirically. The\namount may be enormous, colossal; but absolute monism is shattered if,\nalong with all the union, there has to be granted the slightest modicum,\nthe most incipient nascency, or the most residual trace, of a separation\nthat is not 'overcome.'\nPragmatism, pending the final empirical ascertainment of just what the\nbalance of union and disunion among things may be, must obviously range\nherself upon the pluralistic side. Some day, she admits, even total\nunion, with one knower, one origin, and a universe consolidated in\nevery conceivable way, may turn out to be the most acceptable of all\nhypotheses. Meanwhile the opposite hypothesis, of a world imperfectly\nunified still, and perhaps always to remain so, must be sincerely\nentertained. This latter hypothesis is pluralism's doctrine. Since\nabsolute monism forbids its being even considered seriously, branding it\nas irrational from the start, it is clear that pragmatism must turn its\nback on absolute monism, and follow pluralism's more empirical path.\nThis leaves us with the common-sense world, in which we find things\npartly joined and partly disjoined. 'Things,' then, and their\n'conjunctions'--what do such words mean, pragmatically handled? In\nmy next lecture, I will apply the pragmatic method to the stage of\nphilosophizing known as Common Sense.\nLecture V\nPragmatism and Common Sense\nIn the last lecture we turned ourselves from the usual way of talking\nof the universe's oneness as a principle, sublime in all its blankness,\ntowards a study of the special kinds of union which the universe\nenfolds. We found many of these to coexist with kinds of separation\nequally real. \"How far am I verified?\" is the question which each\nkind of union and each kind of separation asks us here, so as good\npragmatists we have to turn our face towards experience, towards\n'facts.'\nAbsolute oneness remains, but only as an hypothesis, and that hypothesis\nis reduced nowadays to that of an omniscient knower who sees all things\nwithout exception as forming one single systematic fact. But the knower\nin question may still be conceived either as an Absolute or as an\nUltimate; and over against the hypothesis of him in either form the\ncounter-hypothesis that the widest field of knowledge that ever was or\nwill be still contains some ignorance, may be legitimately held. Some\nbits of information always may escape.\nThis is the hypothesis of NOETIC PLURALISM, which monists consider so\nabsurd. Since we are bound to treat it as respectfully as noetic monism,\nuntil the facts shall have tipped the beam, we find that our pragmatism,\ntho originally nothing but a method, has forced us to be friendly to the\npluralistic view. It MAY be that some parts of the world are connected\nso loosely with some other parts as to be strung along by nothing but\nthe copula AND. They might even come and go without those other parts\nsuffering any internal change. This pluralistic view, of a world of\nADDITIVE constitution, is one that pragmatism is unable to rule out from\nserious consideration. But this view leads one to the farther hypothesis\nthat the actual world, instead of being complete 'eternally,' as the\nmonists assure us, may be eternally incomplete, and at all times subject\nto addition or liable to loss.\nIt IS at any rate incomplete in one respect, and flagrantly so. The very\nfact that we debate this question shows that our KNOWLEDGE is incomplete\nat present and subject to addition. In respect of the knowledge it\ncontains the world does genuinely change and grow. Some general remarks\non the way in which our knowledge completes itself--when it does\ncomplete itself--will lead us very conveniently into our subject for\nthis lecture, which is 'Common Sense.'\nTo begin with, our knowledge grows IN SPOTS. The spots may be large or\nsmall, but the knowledge never grows all over: some old knowledge always\nremains what it was. Your knowledge of pragmatism, let us suppose, is\ngrowing now. Later, its growth may involve considerable modification of\nopinions which you previously held to be true. But such modifications\nare apt to be gradual. To take the nearest possible example, consider\nthese lectures of mine. What you first gain from them is probably a\nsmall amount of new information, a few new definitions, or distinctions,\nor points of view. But while these special ideas are being added, the\nrest of your knowledge stands still, and only gradually will you 'line\nup' your previous opinions with the novelties I am trying to instil, and\nmodify to some slight degree their mass.\nYou listen to me now, I suppose, with certain prepossessions as to my\ncompetency, and these affect your reception of what I say, but were I\nsuddenly to break off lecturing, and to begin to sing 'We won't go home\ntill morning' in a rich baritone voice, not only would that new fact be\nadded to your stock, but it would oblige you to define me differently,\nand that might alter your opinion of the pragmatic philosophy, and in\ngeneral bring about a rearrangement of a number of your ideas. Your mind\nin such processes is strained, and sometimes painfully so, between its\nolder beliefs and the novelties which experience brings along.\nOur minds thus grow in spots; and like grease-spots, the spots spread.\nBut we let them spread as little as possible: we keep unaltered as much\nof our old knowledge, as many of our old prejudices and beliefs, as we\ncan. We patch and tinker more than we renew. The novelty soaks in; it\nstains the ancient mass; but it is also tinged by what absorbs it. Our\npast apperceives and co-operates; and in the new equilibrium in which\neach step forward in the process of learning terminates, it happens\nrelatively seldom that the new fact is added RAW. More usually it is\nembedded cooked, as one might say, or stewed down in the sauce of the\nold.\nNew truths thus are resultants of new experiences and of old truths\ncombined and mutually modifying one another. And since this is the case\nin the changes of opinion of to-day, there is no reason to assume that\nit has not been so at all times. It follows that very ancient modes\nof thought may have survived through all the later changes in men's\nopinions. The most primitive ways of thinking may not yet be wholly\nexpunged. Like our five fingers, our ear-bones, our rudimentary caudal\nappendage, or our other 'vestigial' peculiarities, they may remain as\nindelible tokens of events in our race-history. Our ancestors may at\ncertain moments have struck into ways of thinking which they might\nconceivably not have found. But once they did so, and after the fact,\nthe inheritance continues. When you begin a piece of music in a certain\nkey, you must keep the key to the end. You may alter your house ad\nlibitum, but the ground-plan of the first architect persists--you can\nmake great changes, but you cannot change a Gothic church into a Doric\ntemple. You may rinse and rinse the bottle, but you can't get the taste\nof the medicine or whiskey that first filled it wholly out.\nMy thesis now is this, that OUR FUNDAMENTAL WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT\nTHINGS ARE DISCOVERIES OF EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE ANCESTORS, WHICH HAVE BEEN\nABLE TO PRESERVE THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL SUBSEQUENT\nTIME. They form one great stage of equilibrium in the human mind's\ndevelopment, the stage of common sense. Other stages have grafted\nthemselves upon this stage, but have never succeeded in displacing it.\nLet us consider this common-sense stage first, as if it might be final.\nIn practical talk, a man's common sense means his good judgment, his\nfreedom from excentricity, his GUMPTION, to use the vernacular word. In\nphilosophy it means something entirely different, it means his use of\ncertain intellectual forms or categories of thought. Were we lobsters,\nor bees, it might be that our organization would have led to our using\nquite different modes from these of apprehending our experiences. It\nMIGHT be too (we cannot dogmatically deny this) that such categories,\nunimaginable by us to-day, would have proved on the whole as serviceable\nfor handling our experiences mentally as those which we actually use.\nIf this sounds paradoxical to anyone, let him think of analytical\ngeometry. The identical figures which Euclid defined by intrinsic\nrelations were defined by Descartes by the relations of their points to\nadventitious co-ordinates, the result being an absolutely different and\nvastly more potent way of handling curves. All our conceptions are what\nthe Germans call denkmittel, means by which we handle facts by thinking\nthem. Experience merely as such doesn't come ticketed and labeled, we\nhave first to discover what it is. Kant speaks of it as being in\nits first intention a gewuehl der erscheinungen, a rhapsodie der\nwahrnehmungen, a mere motley which we have to unify by our wits. What\nwe usually do is first to frame some system of concepts mentally\nclassified, serialized, or connected in some intellectual way, and then\nto use this as a tally by which we 'keep tab' on the impressions that\npresent themselves. When each is referred to some possible place in the\nconceptual system, it is thereby 'understood.' This notion of parallel\n'manifolds' with their elements standing reciprocally in 'one-to-one\nrelations,' is proving so convenient nowadays in mathematics and logic\nas to supersede more and more the older classificatory conceptions.\nThere are many conceptual systems of this sort; and the sense\nmanifold is also such a system. Find a one-to-one relation for your\nsense-impressions ANYWHERE among the concepts, and in so far forth you\nrationalize the impressions. But obviously you can rationalize them by\nusing various conceptual systems.\nThe old common-sense way of rationalizing them is by a set of concepts\nof which the most important are these:\nThing;\nThe same or different;\nKinds;\nMinds;\nBodies;\nOne Time;\nOne Space;\nSubjects and attributes;\nCausal influences;\nThe fancied;\nThe real.\nWe are now so familiar with the order that these notions have woven for\nus out of the everlasting weather of our perceptions that we find it\nhard to realize how little of a fixed routine the perceptions follow\nwhen taken by themselves. The word weather is a good one to use here.\nIn Boston, for example, the weather has almost no routine, the only law\nbeing that if you have had any weather for two days, you will probably\nbut not certainly have another weather on the third. Weather-experience\nas it thus comes to Boston, is discontinuous and chaotic. In point of\ntemperature, of wind, rain or sunshine, it MAY change three times a\nday. But the Washington weather-bureau intellectualizes this disorder by\nmaking each successive bit of Boston weather EPISODIC. It refers it to\nits place and moment in a continental cyclone, on the history of which\nthe local changes everywhere are strung as beads are strung upon a cord.\nNow it seems almost certain that young children and the inferior animals\ntake all their experiences very much as uninstructed Bostonians take\ntheir weather. They know no more of time or space as world-receptacles,\nor of permanent subjects and changing predicates, or of causes,\nor kinds, or thoughts, or things, than our common people know of\ncontinental cyclones. A baby's rattle drops out of his hand, but the\nbaby looks not for it. It has 'gone out' for him, as a candle-flame goes\nout; and it comes back, when you replace it in his hand, as the flame\ncomes back when relit. The idea of its being a 'thing,' whose permanent\nexistence by itself he might interpolate between its successive\napparitions has evidently not occurred to him. It is the same with dogs.\nOut of sight, out of mind, with them. It is pretty evident that they\nhave no GENERAL tendency to interpolate 'things.' Let me quote here a\npassage from my colleague G. Santayana's book.\n\"If a dog, while sniffing about contentedly, sees afar off his master\narriving after long absence...the poor brute asks for no reason why\nhis master went, why he has come again, why he should be loved, or why\npresently while lying at his feet you forget him and begin to grunt and\ndream of the chase--all that is an utter mystery, utterly unconsidered.\nSuch experience has variety, scenery, and a certain vital rhythm;\nits story might be told in dithyrambic verse. It moves wholly by\ninspiration; every event is providential, every act unpremeditated.\nAbsolute freedom and absolute helplessness have met together: you\ndepend wholly on divine favour, yet that unfathomable agency is not\ndistinguishable from your own life. ...[But] the figures even of that\ndisordered drama have their exits and their entrances; and their cues\ncan be gradually discovered by a being capable of fixing his\nattention and retaining the order of events. ...In proportion as such\nunderstanding advances each moment of experience becomes consequential\nand prophetic of the rest. The calm places in life are filled with power\nand its spasms with resource. No emotion can overwhelm the mind, for\nof none is the basis or issue wholly hidden; no event can disconcert it\naltogether, because it sees beyond. Means can be looked for to escape\nfrom the worst predicament; and whereas each moment had been formerly\nfilled with nothing but its own adventure and surprised emotion, each\nnow makes room for the lesson of what went before and surmises what\nmay be the plot of the whole.\"[Footnote: The Life of Reason: Reason in\nCommon Sense, 1905, p. 59.]\nEven to-day science and philosophy are still laboriously trying to part\nfancies from realities in our experience; and in primitive times they\nmade only the most incipient distinctions in this line. Men believed\nwhatever they thought with any liveliness, and they mixed their dreams\nwith their realities inextricably. The categories of 'thought' and\n'things' are indispensable here--instead of being realities we now call\ncertain experiences only 'thoughts.' There is not a category, among\nthose enumerated, of which we may not imagine the use to have thus\noriginated historically and only gradually spread.\nThat one Time which we all believe in and in which each event has its\ndefinite date, that one Space in which each thing has its position,\nthese abstract notions unify the world incomparably; but in their\nfinished shape as concepts how different they are from the loose\nunordered time-and-space experiences of natural men! Everything that\nhappens to us brings its own duration and extension, and both are\nvaguely surrounded by a marginal 'more' that runs into the duration\nand extension of the next thing that comes. But we soon lose all our\ndefinite bearings; and not only do our children make no distinction\nbetween yesterday and the day before yesterday, the whole past being\nchurned up together, but we adults still do so whenever the times are\nlarge. It is the same with spaces. On a map I can distinctly see the\nrelation of London, Constantinople, and Pekin to the place where I am;\nin reality I utterly fail to FEEL the facts which the map symbolizes.\nThe directions and distances are vague, confused and mixed. Cosmic space\nand cosmic time, so far from being the intuitions that Kant said they\nwere, are constructions as patently artificial as any that science can\nshow. The great majority of the human race never use these notions, but\nlive in plural times and spaces, interpenetrant and DURCHEINANDER.\nPermanent 'things' again; the 'same' thing and its various 'appearances'\nand 'alterations'; the different 'kinds' of thing; with the 'kind' used\nfinally as a 'predicate,' of which the thing remains the 'subject'--what\na straightening of the tangle of our experience's immediate flux and\nsensible variety does this list of terms suggest! And it is only\nthe smallest part of his experience's flux that anyone actually does\nstraighten out by applying to it these conceptual instruments. Out of\nthem all our lowest ancestors probably used only, and then most vaguely\nand inaccurately, the notion of 'the same again.' But even then if\nyou had asked them whether the same were a 'thing' that had endured\nthroughout the unseen interval, they would probably have been at a\nloss, and would have said that they had never asked that question, or\nconsidered matters in that light.\nKinds, and sameness of kind--what colossally useful DENKMITTEL for\nfinding our way among the many! The manyness might conceivably have\nbeen absolute. Experiences might have all been singulars, no one of them\noccurring twice. In such a world logic would have had no application;\nfor kind and sameness of kind are logic's only instruments. Once we know\nthat whatever is of a kind is also of that kind's kind, we can travel\nthrough the universe as if with seven-league boots. Brutes surely never\nuse these abstractions, and civilized men use them in most various\namounts.\nCausal influence, again! This, if anything, seems to have been an\nantediluvian conception; for we find primitive men thinking that almost\neverything is significant and can exert influence of some sort. The\nsearch for the more definite influences seems to have started in the\nquestion: \"Who, or what, is to blame?\"--for any illness, namely, or\ndisaster, or untoward thing. From this centre the search for causal\ninfluences has spread. Hume and 'Science' together have tried to\neliminate the whole notion of influence, substituting the entirely\ndifferent DENKMITTEL of 'law.' But law is a comparatively recent\ninvention, and influence reigns supreme in the older realm of common\nsense.\nThe 'possible,' as something less than the actual and more than the\nwholly unreal, is another of these magisterial notions of common sense.\nCriticize them as you may, they persist; and we fly back to them the\nmoment critical pressure is relaxed. 'Self,' 'body,' in the substantial\nor metaphysical sense--no one escapes subjection to THOSE forms\nof thought. In practice, the common-sense DENKMITTEL are uniformly\nvictorious. Everyone, however instructed, still thinks of a 'thing' in\nthe common-sense way, as a permanent unit-subject that 'supports' its\nattributes interchangeably. No one stably or sincerely uses the more\ncritical notion, of a group of sense-qualities united by a law. With\nthese categories in our hand, we make our plans and plot together, and\nconnect all the remoter parts of experience with what lies before our\neyes. Our later and more critical philosophies are mere fads and fancies\ncompared with this natural mother-tongue of thought.\nCommon sense appears thus as a perfectly definite stage in our\nunderstanding of things, a stage that satisfies in an extraordinarily\nsuccessful way the purposes for which we think. 'Things' do exist, even\nwhen we do not see them. Their 'kinds' also exist. Their 'qualities' are\nwhat they act by, and are what we act on; and these also exist. These\nlamps shed their quality of light on every object in this room. We\nintercept IT on its way whenever we hold up an opaque screen. It is\nthe very sound that my lips emit that travels into your ears. It is the\nsensible heat of the fire that migrates into the water in which we boil\nan egg; and we can change the heat into coolness by dropping in a\nlump of ice. At this stage of philosophy all non-European men without\nexception have remained. It suffices for all the necessary practical\nends of life; and, among our own race even, it is only the highly\nsophisticated specimens, the minds debauched by learning, as Berkeley\ncalls them, who have ever even suspected common sense of not being\nabsolutely true.\nBut when we look back, and speculate as to how the common-sense\ncategories may have achieved their wonderful supremacy, no reason\nappears why it may not have been by a process just like that by which\nthe conceptions due to Democritus, Berkeley, or Darwin, achieved their\nsimilar triumphs in more recent times. In other words, they may have\nbeen successfully DISCOVERED by prehistoric geniuses whose names the\nnight of antiquity has covered up; they may have been verified by the\nimmediate facts of experience which they first fitted; and then from\nfact to fact and from man to man they may have SPREAD, until all\nlanguage rested on them and we are now incapable of thinking naturally\nin any other terms. Such a view would only follow the rule that has\nproved elsewhere so fertile, of assuming the vast and remote to conform\nto the laws of formation that we can observe at work in the small and\nnear.\nFor all utilitarian practical purposes these conceptions amply suffice;\nbut that they began at special points of discovery and only gradually\nspread from one thing to another, seems proved by the exceedingly\ndubious limits of their application to-day. We assume for certain\npurposes one 'objective' Time that AEQUABILITER FLUIT, but we don't\nlivingly believe in or realize any such equally-flowing time. 'Space'\nis a less vague notion; but 'things,' what are they? Is a constellation\nproperly a thing? or an army? or is an ENS RATIONIS such as space or\njustice a thing? Is a knife whose handle and blade are changed the\n'same'? Is the 'changeling,' whom Locke so seriously discusses, of the\nhuman 'kind'? Is 'telepathy' a 'fancy' or a 'fact'? The moment you pass\nbeyond the practical use of these categories (a use usually suggested\nsufficiently by the circumstances of the special case) to a merely\ncurious or speculative way of thinking, you find it impossible to say\nwithin just what limits of fact any one of them shall apply.\nThe peripatetic philosophy, obeying rationalist propensities, has\ntried to eternalize the common-sense categories by treating them very\ntechnically and articulately. A 'thing' for instance is a being, or\nENS. An ENS is a subject in which qualities 'inhere.' A subject is a\nsubstance. Substances are of kinds, and kinds are definite in number,\nand discrete. These distinctions are fundamental and eternal. As terms\nof DISCOURSE they are indeed magnificently useful, but what they mean,\napart from their use in steering our discourse to profitable issues,\ndoes not appear. If you ask a scholastic philosopher what a substance\nmay be in itself, apart from its being the support of attributes, he\nsimply says that your intellect knows perfectly what the word means.\nBut what the intellect knows clearly is only the word itself and its\nsteering function. So it comes about that intellects SIBI PERMISSI,\nintellects only curious and idle, have forsaken the common-sense level\nfor what in general terms may be called the 'critical' level of thought.\nNot merely SUCH intellects either--your Humes and Berkeleys and Hegels;\nbut practical observers of facts, your Galileos, Daltons, Faradays, have\nfound it impossible to treat the NAIFS sense-termini of common sense\nas ultimately real. As common sense interpolates her constant 'things'\nbetween our intermittent sensations, so science EXTRApolates her world\nof 'primary' qualities, her atoms, her ether, her magnetic fields, and\nthe like, beyond the common-sense world. The 'things' are now invisible\nimpalpable things; and the old visible common-sense things are supposed\nto result from the mixture of these invisibles. Or else the whole NAIF\nconception of thing gets superseded, and a thing's name is interpreted\nas denoting only the law or REGEL DER VERBINDUNG by which certain of our\nsensations habitually succeed or coexist.\nScience and critical philosophy thus burst the bounds of common sense.\nWith science NAIF realism ceases: 'Secondary' qualities become unreal;\nprimary ones alone remain. With critical philosophy, havoc is made of\neverything. The common-sense categories one and all cease to represent\nanything in the way of BEING; they are but sublime tricks of human\nthought, our ways of escaping bewilderment in the midst of sensation's\nirremediable flow.\nBut the scientific tendency in critical thought, tho inspired at first\nby purely intellectual motives, has opened an entirely unexpected range\nof practical utilities to our astonished view. Galileo gave us accurate\nclocks and accurate artillery-practice; the chemists flood us with new\nmedicines and dye-stuffs; Ampere and Faraday have endowed us with the\nNew York subway and with Marconi telegrams. The hypothetical things that\nsuch men have invented, defined as they have defined them, are showing\nan extraordinary fertility in consequences verifiable by sense. Our\nlogic can deduce from them a consequence due under certain conditions,\nwe can then bring about the conditions, and presto, the consequence\nis there before our eyes. The scope of the practical control of nature\nnewly put into our hand by scientific ways of thinking vastly exceeds\nthe scope of the old control grounded on common sense. Its rate of\nincrease accelerates so that no one can trace the limit; one may even\nfear that the BEING of man may be crushed by his own powers, that his\nfixed nature as an organism may not prove adequate to stand the strain\nof the ever increasingly tremendous functions, almost divine creative\nfunctions, which his intellect will more and more enable him to wield.\nHe may drown in his wealth like a child in a bath-tub, who has turned on\nthe water and who cannot turn it off.\nThe philosophic stage of criticism, much more thorough in its negations\nthan the scientific stage, so far gives us no new range of practical\npower. Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, have all been utterly\nsterile, so far as shedding any light on the details of nature goes, and\nI can think of no invention or discovery that can be directly traced\nto anything in their peculiar thought, for neither with Berkeley's\ntar-water nor with Kant's nebular hypothesis had their respective\nphilosophic tenets anything to do. The satisfactions they yield to their\ndisciples are intellectual, not practical; and even then we have to\nconfess that there is a large minus-side to the account.\nThere are thus at least three well-characterized levels, stages or types\nof thought about the world we live in, and the notions of one stage\nhave one kind of merit, those of another stage another kind. It is\nimpossible, however, to say that any stage as yet in sight is absolutely\nmore TRUE than any other. Common sense is the more CONSOLIDATED stage,\nbecause it got its innings first, and made all language into its ally.\nWhether it or science be the more AUGUST stage may be left to private\njudgment. But neither consolidation nor augustness are decisive marks of\ntruth. If common sense were true, why should science have had to\nbrand the secondary qualities, to which our world owes all its living\ninterest, as false, and to invent an invisible world of points and\ncurves and mathematical equations instead? Why should it have needed\nto transform causes and activities into laws of 'functional variation'?\nVainly did scholasticism, common sense's college-trained younger sister,\nseek to stereotype the forms the human family had always talked with,\nto make them definite and fix them for eternity. Substantial forms (in\nother words our secondary qualities) hardly outlasted the year of our\nLord 1600. People were already tired of them then; and Galileo, and\nDescartes, with his 'new philosophy,' gave them only a little later\ntheir coup de grace.\nBut now if the new kinds of scientific 'thing,' the corpuscular and\netheric world, were essentially more 'true,' why should they have\nexcited so much criticism within the body of science itself? Scientific\nlogicians are saying on every hand that these entities and their\ndeterminations, however definitely conceived, should not be held for\nliterally real. It is AS IF they existed; but in reality they are like\nco-ordinates or logarithms, only artificial short-cuts for taking us\nfrom one part to another of experience's flux. We can cipher fruitfully\nwith them; they serve us wonderfully; but we must not be their dupes.\nThere is no RINGING conclusion possible when we compare these types\nof thinking, with a view to telling which is the more absolutely true.\nTheir naturalness, their intellectual economy, their fruitfulness for\npractice, all start up as distinct tests of their veracity, and as a\nresult we get confused. Common sense is BETTER for one sphere of life,\nscience for another, philosophic criticism for a third; but whether\neither be TRUER absolutely, Heaven only knows. Just now, if I understand\nthe matter rightly, we are witnessing a curious reversion to the\ncommon-sense way of looking at physical nature, in the philosophy of\nscience favored by such men as Mach, Ostwald and Duhem. According to\nthese teachers no hypothesis is truer than any other in the sense of\nbeing a more literal copy of reality. They are all but ways of talking\non our part, to be compared solely from the point of view of their USE.\nThe only literally true thing is REALITY; and the only reality we know\nis, for these logicians, sensible reality, the flux of our sensations\nand emotions as they pass. 'Energy' is the collective name (according\nto Ostwald) for the sensations just as they present themselves (the\nmovement, heat, magnetic pull, or light, or whatever it may be) when\nthey are measured in certain ways. So measuring them, we are enabled\nto describe the correlated changes which they show us, in formulas\nmatchless for their simplicity and fruitfulness for human use. They are\nsovereign triumphs of economy in thought.\nNo one can fail to admire the 'energetic' philosophy. But the\nhypersensible entities, the corpuscles and vibrations, hold their own\nwith most physicists and chemists, in spite of its appeal. It seems too\neconomical to be all-sufficient. Profusion, not economy, may after all\nbe reality's key-note.\nI am dealing here with highly technical matters, hardly suitable for\npopular lecturing, and in which my own competence is small. All the\nbetter for my conclusion, however, which at this point is this. The\nwhole notion of truth, which naturally and without reflexion we assume\nto mean the simple duplication by the mind of a ready-made and given\nreality, proves hard to understand clearly. There is no simple test\navailable for adjudicating offhand between the divers types of thought\nthat claim to possess it. Common sense, common science or corpuscular\nphilosophy, ultra-critical science, or energetics, and critical or\nidealistic philosophy, all seem insufficiently true in some regard and\nleave some dissatisfaction. It is evident that the conflict of these so\nwidely differing systems obliges us to overhaul the very idea of truth,\nfor at present we have no definite notion of what the word may mean. I\nshall face that task in my next lecture, and will add but a few words,\nin finishing the present one.\nThere are only two points that I wish you to retain from the present\nlecture. The first one relates to common sense. We have seen reason to\nsuspect it, to suspect that in spite of their being so venerable, of\ntheir being so universally used and built into the very structure\nof language, its categories may after all be only a collection of\nextraordinarily successful hypotheses (historically discovered or\ninvented by single men, but gradually communicated, and used by\neverybody) by which our forefathers have from time immemorial unified\nand straightened the discontinuity of their immediate experiences,\nand put themselves into an equilibrium with the surface of nature so\nsatisfactory for ordinary practical purposes that it certainly would\nhave lasted forever, but for the excessive intellectual vivacity of\nDemocritus, Archimedes, Galileo, Berkeley, and other excentric geniuses\nwhom the example of such men inflamed. Retain, I pray you, this\nsuspicion about common sense.\nThe other point is this. Ought not the existence of the various types of\nthinking which we have reviewed, each so splendid for certain purposes,\nyet all conflicting still, and neither one of them able to support a\nclaim of absolute veracity, to awaken a presumption favorable to the\npragmatistic view that all our theories are INSTRUMENTAL, are mental\nmodes of ADAPTATION to reality, rather than revelations or gnostic\nanswers to some divinely instituted world-enigma? I expressed this view\nas clearly as I could in the second of these lectures. Certainly the\nrestlessness of the actual theoretic situation, the value for some\npurposes of each thought-level, and the inability of either to expel the\nothers decisively, suggest this pragmatistic view, which I hope that the\nnext lectures may soon make entirely convincing. May there not after all\nbe a possible ambiguity in truth?\nLecture VI\nPragmatism's Conception of Truth\nWhen Clerk Maxwell was a child it is written that he had a mania for\nhaving everything explained to him, and that when people put him off\nwith vague verbal accounts of any phenomenon he would interrupt them\nimpatiently by saying, \"Yes; but I want you to tell me the PARTICULAR GO\nof it!\" Had his question been about truth, only a pragmatist could\nhave told him the particular go of it. I believe that our contemporary\npragmatists, especially Messrs. Schiller and Dewey, have given the only\ntenable account of this subject. It is a very ticklish subject, sending\nsubtle rootlets into all kinds of crannies, and hard to treat in the\nsketchy way that alone befits a public lecture. But the Schiller-Dewey\nview of truth has been so ferociously attacked by rationalistic\nphilosophers, and so abominably misunderstood, that here, if anywhere,\nis the point where a clear and simple statement should be made.\nI fully expect to see the pragmatist view of truth run through the\nclassic stages of a theory's career. First, you know, a new theory is\nattacked as absurd; then it is admitted to be true, but obvious\nand insignificant; finally it is seen to be so important that its\nadversaries claim that they themselves discovered it. Our doctrine of\ntruth is at present in the first of these three stages, with symptoms\nof the second stage having begun in certain quarters. I wish that this\nlecture might help it beyond the first stage in the eyes of many of you.\nTruth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our\nideas. It means their 'agreement,' as falsity means their disagreement,\nwith 'reality.' Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this\ndefinition as a matter of course. They begin to quarrel only after\nthe question is raised as to what may precisely be meant by the term\n'agreement,' and what by the term 'reality,' when reality is taken as\nsomething for our ideas to agree with.\nIn answering these questions the pragmatists are more analytic and\npainstaking, the intellectualists more offhand and irreflective. The\npopular notion is that a true idea must copy its reality. Like\nother popular views, this one follows the analogy of the most usual\nexperience. Our true ideas of sensible things do indeed copy them. Shut\nyour eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get just such\na true picture or copy of its dial. But your idea of its 'works' (unless\nyou are a clock-maker) is much less of a copy, yet it passes muster, for\nit in no way clashes with the reality. Even tho it should shrink to the\nmere word 'works,' that word still serves you truly; and when you\nspeak of the 'time-keeping function' of the clock, or of its spring's\n'elasticity,' it is hard to see exactly what your ideas can copy.\nYou perceive that there is a problem here. Where our ideas cannot copy\ndefinitely their object, what does agreement with that object mean?\nSome idealists seem to say that they are true whenever they are what\nGod means that we ought to think about that object. Others hold the\ncopy-view all through, and speak as if our ideas possessed truth just\nin proportion as they approach to being copies of the Absolute's eternal\nway of thinking.\nThese views, you see, invite pragmatistic discussion. But the great\nassumption of the intellectualists is that truth means essentially\nan inert static relation. When you've got your true idea of anything,\nthere's an end of the matter. You're in possession; you KNOW; you have\nfulfilled your thinking destiny. You are where you ought to be mentally;\nyou have obeyed your categorical imperative; and nothing more need\nfollow on that climax of your rational destiny. Epistemologically you\nare in stable equilibrium.\nPragmatism, on the other hand, asks its usual question. \"Grant an idea\nor belief to be true,\" it says, \"what concrete difference will its being\ntrue make in anyone's actual life? How will the truth be realized?\nWhat experiences will be different from those which would obtain if\nthe belief were false? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in\nexperiential terms?\"\nThe moment pragmatism asks this question, it sees the answer: TRUE IDEAS\nARE THOSE THAT WE CAN ASSIMILATE, VALIDATE, CORROBORATE AND VERIFY.\nFALSE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CANNOT. That is the practical difference\nit makes to us to have true ideas; that, therefore, is the meaning of\ntruth, for it is all that truth is known-as.\nThis thesis is what I have to defend. The truth of an idea is not a\nstagnant property inherent in it. Truth HAPPENS to an idea. It BECOMES\ntrue, is MADE true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process:\nthe process namely of its verifying itself, its veri-FICATION. Its\nvalidity is the process of its valid-ATION.\nBut what do the words verification and validation themselves\npragmatically mean? They again signify certain practical consequences of\nthe verified and validated idea. It is hard to find any one phrase\nthat characterizes these consequences better than the ordinary\nagreement-formula--just such consequences being what we have in mind\nwhenever we say that our ideas 'agree' with reality. They lead us,\nnamely, through the acts and other ideas which they instigate, into or\nup to, or towards, other parts of experience with which we feel all the\nwhile-such feeling being among our potentialities--that the original\nideas remain in agreement. The connexions and transitions come to us\nfrom point to point as being progressive, harmonious, satisfactory. This\nfunction of agreeable leading is what we mean by an idea's verification.\nSuch an account is vague and it sounds at first quite trivial, but it\nhas results which it will take the rest of my hour to explain.\nLet me begin by reminding you of the fact that the possession of true\nthoughts means everywhere the possession of invaluable instruments\nof action; and that our duty to gain truth, so far from being a\nblank command from out of the blue, or a 'stunt' self-imposed by our\nintellect, can account for itself by excellent practical reasons.\nThe importance to human life of having true beliefs about matters of\nfact is a thing too notorious. We live in a world of realities that can\nbe infinitely useful or infinitely harmful. Ideas that tell us which\nof them to expect count as the true ideas in all this primary sphere of\nverification, and the pursuit of such ideas is a primary human duty. The\npossession of truth, so far from being here an end in itself, is only a\npreliminary means towards other vital satisfactions. If I am lost in\nthe woods and starved, and find what looks like a cow-path, it is of the\nutmost importance that I should think of a human habitation at the end\nof it, for if I do so and follow it, I save myself. The true thought\nis useful here because the house which is its object is useful. The\npractical value of true ideas is thus primarily derived from the\npractical importance of their objects to us. Their objects are, indeed,\nnot important at all times. I may on another occasion have no use\nfor the house; and then my idea of it, however verifiable, will be\npractically irrelevant, and had better remain latent. Yet since almost\nany object may some day become temporarily important, the advantage of\nhaving a general stock of extra truths, of ideas that shall be true of\nmerely possible situations, is obvious. We store such extra truths away\nin our memories, and with the overflow we fill our books of reference.\nWhenever such an extra truth becomes practically relevant to one of our\nemergencies, it passes from cold-storage to do work in the world, and\nour belief in it grows active. You can say of it then either that 'it\nis useful because it is true' or that 'it is true because it is useful.'\nBoth these phrases mean exactly the same thing, namely that here is\nan idea that gets fulfilled and can be verified. True is the name for\nwhatever idea starts the verification-process, useful is the name for\nits completed function in experience. True ideas would never have been\nsingled out as such, would never have acquired a class-name, least of\nall a name suggesting value, unless they had been useful from the outset\nin this way.\nFrom this simple cue pragmatism gets her general notion of truth as\nsomething essentially bound up with the way in which one moment in our\nexperience may lead us towards other moments which it will be worth\nwhile to have been led to. Primarily, and on the common-sense level, the\ntruth of a state of mind means this function of A LEADING THAT IS WORTH\nWHILE. When a moment in our experience, of any kind whatever, inspires\nus with a thought that is true, that means that sooner or later we dip\nby that thought's guidance into the particulars of experience again and\nmake advantageous connexion with them. This is a vague enough statement,\nbut I beg you to retain it, for it is essential.\nOur experience meanwhile is all shot through with regularities. One\nbit of it can warn us to get ready for another bit, can 'intend' or\nbe 'significant of' that remoter object. The object's advent is the\nsignificance's verification. Truth, in these cases, meaning nothing but\neventual verification, is manifestly incompatible with waywardness on\nour part. Woe to him whose beliefs play fast and loose with the order\nwhich realities follow in his experience: they will lead him nowhere or\nelse make false connexions.\nBy 'realities' or 'objects' here, we mean either things of common sense,\nsensibly present, or else common-sense relations, such as dates, places,\ndistances, kinds, activities. Following our mental image of a house\nalong the cow-path, we actually come to see the house; we get the\nimage's full verification. SUCH SIMPLY AND FULLY VERIFIED LEADINGS ARE\nCERTAINLY THE ORIGINALS AND PROTOTYPES OF THE TRUTH-PROCESS. Experience\noffers indeed other forms of truth-process, but they are all conceivable\nas being primary verifications arrested, multiplied or substituted one\nfor another.\nTake, for instance, yonder object on the wall. You and I consider it to\nbe a 'clock,' altho no one of us has seen the hidden works that make it\none. We let our notion pass for true without attempting to verify. If\ntruths mean verification-process essentially, ought we then to call such\nunverified truths as this abortive? No, for they form the overwhelmingly\nlarge number of the truths we live by. Indirect as well as direct\nverifications pass muster. Where circumstantial evidence is sufficient,\nwe can go without eye-witnessing. Just as we here assume Japan to exist\nwithout ever having been there, because it WORKS to do so, everything we\nknow conspiring with the belief, and nothing interfering, so we assume\nthat thing to be a clock. We USE it as a clock, regulating the length\nof our lecture by it. The verification of the assumption here means its\nleading to no frustration or contradiction. VerifiABILITY of wheels and\nweights and pendulum is as good as verification. For one truth-process\ncompleted there are a million in our lives that function in this state\nof nascency. They turn us TOWARDS direct verification; lead us into the\nSURROUNDINGS of the objects they envisage; and then, if everything runs\non harmoniously, we are so sure that verification is possible that we\nomit it, and are usually justified by all that happens.\nTruth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system. Our\nthoughts and beliefs 'pass,' so long as nothing challenges them, just as\nbank-notes pass so long as nobody refuses them. But this all points to\ndirect face-to-face verifications somewhere, without which the fabric of\ntruth collapses like a financial system with no cash-basis whatever.\nYou accept my verification of one thing, I yours of another. We trade on\neach other's truth. But beliefs verified concretely by SOMEBODY are the\nposts of the whole superstructure.\nAnother great reason--beside economy of time--for waiving complete\nverification in the usual business of life is that all things exist\nin kinds and not singly. Our world is found once for all to have that\npeculiarity. So that when we have once directly verified our ideas about\none specimen of a kind, we consider ourselves free to apply them to\nother specimens without verification. A mind that habitually\ndiscerns the kind of thing before it, and acts by the law of the\nkind immediately, without pausing to verify, will be a 'true' mind\nin ninety-nine out of a hundred emergencies, proved so by its conduct\nfitting everything it meets, and getting no refutation.\nINDIRECTLY OR ONLY POTENTIALLY VERIFYING PROCESSES MAY THUS BE TRUE AS\nWELL AS FULL VERIFICATION-PROCESSES. They work as true processes would\nwork, give us the same advantages, and claim our recognition for the\nsame reasons. All this on the common-sense level of, matters of fact,\nwhich we are alone considering.\nBut matters of fact are not our only stock in trade. RELATIONS AMONG\nPURELY MENTAL IDEAS form another sphere where true and false beliefs\nobtain, and here the beliefs are absolute, or unconditional. When they\nare true they bear the name either of definitions or of principles. It\nis either a principle or a definition that 1 and 1 make 2, that 2 and 1\nmake 3, and so on; that white differs less from gray than it does from\nblack; that when the cause begins to act the effect also commences. Such\npropositions hold of all possible 'ones,' of all conceivable 'whites'\nand 'grays' and 'causes.' The objects here are mental objects.\nTheir relations are perceptually obvious at a glance, and no\nsense-verification is necessary. Moreover, once true, always true, of\nthose same mental objects. Truth here has an 'eternal' character. If you\ncan find a concrete thing anywhere that is 'one' or 'white' or 'gray,'\nor an 'effect,' then your principles will everlastingly apply to it. It\nis but a case of ascertaining the kind, and then applying the law of its\nkind to the particular object. You are sure to get truth if you can but\nname the kind rightly, for your mental relations hold good of everything\nof that kind without exception. If you then, nevertheless, failed to get\ntruth concretely, you would say that you had classed your real objects\nwrongly.\nIn this realm of mental relations, truth again is an affair of leading.\nWe relate one abstract idea with another, framing in the end great\nsystems of logical and mathematical truth, under the respective terms of\nwhich the sensible facts of experience eventually arrange themselves,\nso that our eternal truths hold good of realities also. This marriage of\nfact and theory is endlessly fertile. What we say is here already true\nin advance of special verification, IF WE HAVE SUBSUMED OUR OBJECTS\nRIGHTLY. Our ready-made ideal framework for all sorts of possible\nobjects follows from the very structure of our thinking. We can no more\nplay fast and loose with these abstract relations than we can do so with\nour sense-experiences. They coerce us; we must treat them consistently,\nwhether or not we like the results. The rules of addition apply to our\ndebts as rigorously as to our assets. The hundredth decimal of pi, the\nratio of the circumference to its diameter, is predetermined ideally\nnow, tho no one may have computed it. If we should ever need the figure\nin our dealings with an actual circle we should need to have it given\nrightly, calculated by the usual rules; for it is the same kind of truth\nthat those rules elsewhere calculate.\nBetween the coercions of the sensible order and those of the ideal\norder, our mind is thus wedged tightly. Our ideas must agree with\nrealities, be such realities concrete or abstract, be they facts or be\nthey principles, under penalty of endless inconsistency and frustration.\nSo far, intellectualists can raise no protest. They can only say that we\nhave barely touched the skin of the matter.\nRealities mean, then, either concrete facts, or abstract kinds of things\nand relations perceived intuitively between them. They furthermore and\nthirdly mean, as things that new ideas of ours must no less take account\nof, the whole body of other truths already in our possession. But what\nnow does 'agreement' with such three-fold realities mean?--to use again\nthe definition that is current.\nHere it is that pragmatism and intellectualism begin to part company.\nPrimarily, no doubt, to agree means to copy, but we saw that the mere\nword 'clock' would do instead of a mental picture of its works, and that\nof many realities our ideas can only be symbols and not copies. 'Past\ntime,' 'power,' 'spontaneity'--how can our mind copy such realities?\nTo 'agree' in the widest sense with a reality, CAN ONLY MEAN TO BE\nGUIDED EITHER STRAIGHT UP TO IT OR INTO ITS SURROUNDINGS, OR TO BE PUT\nINTO SUCH WORKING TOUCH WITH IT AS TO HANDLE EITHER IT OR SOMETHING\nCONNECTED WITH IT BETTER THAN IF WE DISAGREED. Better either\nintellectually or practically! And often agreement will only mean\nthe negative fact that nothing contradictory from the quarter of that\nreality comes to interfere with the way in which our ideas guide us\nelsewhere. To copy a reality is, indeed, one very important way of\nagreeing with it, but it is far from being essential. The essential\nthing is the process of being guided. Any idea that helps us to DEAL,\nwhether practically or intellectually, with either the reality or its\nbelongings, that doesn't entangle our progress in frustrations, that\nFITS, in fact, and adapts our life to the reality's whole setting, will\nagree sufficiently to meet the requirement. It will hold true of that\nreality.\nThus, NAMES are just as 'true' or 'false' as definite mental pictures\nare. They set up similar verification-processes, and lead to fully\nequivalent practical results.\nAll human thinking gets discursified; we exchange ideas; we lend and\nborrow verifications, get them from one another by means of social\nintercourse. All truth thus gets verbally built out, stored up, and made\navailable for everyone. Hence, we must TALK consistently just as we must\nTHINK consistently: for both in talk and thought we deal with kinds.\nNames are arbitrary, but once understood they must be kept to. We\nmustn't now call Abel 'Cain' or Cain 'Abel.' If we do, we ungear\nourselves from the whole book of Genesis, and from all its connexions\nwith the universe of speech and fact down to the present time. We throw\nourselves out of whatever truth that entire system of speech and fact\nmay embody.\nThe overwhelming majority of our true ideas admit of no direct or\nface-to-face verification-those of past history, for example, as of Cain\nand Abel. The stream of time can be remounted only verbally, or verified\nindirectly by the present prolongations or effects of what the past\nharbored. Yet if they agree with these verbalities and effects, we can\nknow that our ideas of the past are true. AS TRUE AS PAST TIME ITSELF\nWAS, so true was Julius Caesar, so true were antediluvian monsters,\nall in their proper dates and settings. That past time itself was, is\nguaranteed by its coherence with everything that's present. True as the\npresent is, the past was also.\nAgreement thus turns out to be essentially an affair of leading--leading\nthat is useful because it is into quarters that contain objects that are\nimportant. True ideas lead us into useful verbal and conceptual\nquarters as well as directly up to useful sensible termini. They lead\nto consistency, stability and flowing human intercourse. They lead away\nfrom excentricity and isolation, from foiled and barren thinking. The\nuntrammeled flowing of the leading-process, its general freedom from\nclash and contradiction, passes for its indirect verification; but all\nroads lead to Rome, and in the end and eventually, all true processes\nmust lead to the face of directly verifying sensible experiences\nSOMEWHERE, which somebody's ideas have copied.\nSuch is the large loose way in which the pragmatist interprets the word\nagreement. He treats it altogether practically. He lets it cover any\nprocess of conduction from a present idea to a future terminus, provided\nonly it run prosperously. It is only thus that 'scientific' ideas,\nflying as they do beyond common sense, can be said to agree with their\nrealities. It is, as I have already said, as if reality were made of\nether, atoms or electrons, but we mustn't think so literally. The term\n'energy' doesn't even pretend to stand for anything 'objective.' It is\nonly a way of measuring the surface of phenomena so as to string their\nchanges on a simple formula.\nYet in the choice of these man-made formulas we cannot be capricious\nwith impunity any more than we can be capricious on the common-sense\npractical level. We must find a theory that will WORK; and that means\nsomething extremely difficult; for our theory must mediate between all\nprevious truths and certain new experiences. It must derange common\nsense and previous belief as little as possible, and it must lead to\nsome sensible terminus or other that can be verified exactly. To 'work'\nmeans both these things; and the squeeze is so tight that there is\nlittle loose play for any hypothesis. Our theories are wedged and\ncontrolled as nothing else is. Yet sometimes alternative theoretic\nformulas are equally compatible with all the truths we know, and then we\nchoose between them for subjective reasons. We choose the kind of theory\nto which we are already partial; we follow 'elegance' or 'economy.'\nClerk Maxwell somewhere says it would be \"poor scientific taste\" to\nchoose the more complicated of two equally well-evidenced conceptions;\nand you will all agree with him. Truth in science is what gives us the\nmaximum possible sum of satisfactions, taste included, but consistency\nboth with previous truth and with novel fact is always the most\nimperious claimant.\nI have led you through a very sandy desert. But now, if I may be allowed\nso vulgar an expression, we begin to taste the milk in the cocoanut. Our\nrationalist critics here discharge their batteries upon us, and to reply\nto them will take us out from all this dryness into full sight of a\nmomentous philosophical alternative.\nOur account of truth is an account of truths in the plural, of processes\nof leading, realized in rebus, and having only this quality in common,\nthat they PAY. They pay by guiding us into or towards some part of a\nsystem that dips at numerous points into sense-percepts, which we may\ncopy mentally or not, but with which at any rate we are now in the kind\nof commerce vaguely designated as verification. Truth for us is simply\na collective name for verification-processes, just as health, wealth,\nstrength, etc., are names for other processes connected with life, and\nalso pursued because it pays to pursue them. Truth is MADE, just as\nhealth, wealth and strength are made, in the course of experience.\nHere rationalism is instantaneously up in arms against us. I can imagine\na rationalist to talk as follows:\n\"Truth is not made,\" he will say; \"it absolutely obtains, being a unique\nrelation that does not wait upon any process, but shoots straight over\nthe head of experience, and hits its reality every time. Our belief that\nyon thing on the wall is a clock is true already, altho no one in\nthe whole history of the world should verify it. The bare quality of\nstanding in that transcendent relation is what makes any thought true\nthat possesses it, whether or not there be verification. You pragmatists\nput the cart before the horse in making truth's being reside in\nverification-processes. These are merely signs of its being, merely our\nlame ways of ascertaining after the fact, which of our ideas already has\npossessed the wondrous quality. The quality itself is timeless, like all\nessences and natures. Thoughts partake of it directly, as they partake\nof falsity or of irrelevancy. It can't be analyzed away into pragmatic\nconsequences.\"\nThe whole plausibility of this rationalist tirade is due to the fact\nto which we have already paid so much attention. In our world,\nnamely, abounding as it does in things of similar kinds and similarly\nassociated, one verification serves for others of its kind, and one\ngreat use of knowing things is to be led not so much to them as to their\nassociates, especially to human talk about them. The quality of truth,\nobtaining ante rem, pragmatically means, then, the fact that in such a\nworld innumerable ideas work better by their indirect or possible than\nby their direct and actual verification. Truth ante rem means only\nverifiability, then; or else it is a case of the stock rationalist trick\nof treating the NAME of a concrete phenomenal reality as an independent\nprior entity, and placing it behind the reality as its explanation.\nProfessor Mach quotes somewhere an epigram of Lessing's:\nSagt Hanschen Schlau zu Vetter Fritz, \"Wie kommt es, Vetter Fritzen,\nDass grad' die Reichsten in der Welt, Das meiste Geld besitzen?\"\nHanschen Schlau here treats the principle 'wealth' as something distinct\nfrom the facts denoted by the man's being rich. It antedates them; the\nfacts become only a sort of secondary coincidence with the rich man's\nessential nature.\nIn the case of 'wealth' we all see the fallacy. We know that wealth is\nbut a name for concrete processes that certain men's lives play a\npart in, and not a natural excellence found in Messrs. Rockefeller and\nCarnegie, but not in the rest of us.\nLike wealth, health also lives in rebus. It is a name for processes,\nas digestion, circulation, sleep, etc., that go on happily, tho in this\ninstance we are more inclined to think of it as a principle and to say\nthe man digests and sleeps so well BECAUSE he is so healthy.\nWith 'strength' we are, I think, more rationalistic still, and decidedly\ninclined to treat it as an excellence pre-existing in the man and\nexplanatory of the herculean performances of his muscles.\nWith 'truth' most people go over the border entirely, and treat the\nrationalistic account as self-evident. But really all these words in TH\nare exactly similar. Truth exists ante rem just as much and as little as\nthe other things do.\nThe scholastics, following Aristotle, made much of the distinction\nbetween habit and act. Health in actu means, among other things, good\nsleeping and digesting. But a healthy man need not always be sleeping,\nor always digesting, any more than a wealthy man need be always handling\nmoney, or a strong man always lifting weights. All such qualities sink\nto the status of 'habits' between their times of exercise; and similarly\ntruth becomes a habit of certain of our ideas and beliefs in their\nintervals of rest from their verifying activities. But those activities\nare the root of the whole matter, and the condition of there being any\nhabit to exist in the intervals.\n'The true,' to put it very briefly, is only the expedient in the way of\nour thinking, just as 'the right' is only the expedient in the way of\nour behaving. Expedient in almost any fashion; and expedient in the\nlong run and on the whole of course; for what meets expediently all\nthe experience in sight won't necessarily meet all farther experiences\nequally satisfactorily. Experience, as we know, has ways of BOILING\nOVER, and making us correct our present formulas.\nThe 'absolutely' true, meaning what no farther experience will ever\nalter, is that ideal vanishing-point towards which we imagine that all\nour temporary truths will some day converge. It runs on all fours with\nthe perfectly wise man, and with the absolutely complete experience;\nand, if these ideals are ever realized, they will all be realized\ntogether. Meanwhile we have to live to-day by what truth we can\nget to-day, and be ready to-morrow to call it falsehood. Ptolemaic\nastronomy, euclidean space, aristotelian logic, scholastic metaphysics,\nwere expedient for centuries, but human experience has boiled over\nthose limits, and we now call these things only relatively true, or true\nwithin those borders of experience. 'Absolutely' they are false; for we\nknow that those limits were casual, and might have been transcended by\npast theorists just as they are by present thinkers.\nWhen new experiences lead to retrospective judgments, using the past\ntense, what these judgments utter WAS true, even tho no past thinker\nhad been led there. We live forwards, a Danish thinker has said, but we\nunderstand backwards. The present sheds a backward light on the world's\nprevious processes. They may have been truth-processes for the actors\nin them. They are not so for one who knows the later revelations of the\nstory.\nThis regulative notion of a potential better truth to be established\nlater, possibly to be established some day absolutely, and having powers\nof retroactive legislation, turns its face, like all pragmatist\nnotions, towards concreteness of fact, and towards the future. Like the\nhalf-truths, the absolute truth will have to be MADE, made as a relation\nincidental to the growth of a mass of verification-experience, to which\nthe half-true ideas are all along contributing their quota.\nI have already insisted on the fact that truth is made largely out\nof previous truths. Men's beliefs at any time are so much experience\nfunded. But the beliefs are themselves parts of the sum total of the\nworld's experience, and become matter, therefore, for the next day's\nfunding operations. So far as reality means experienceable reality,\nboth it and the truths men gain about it are everlastingly in process\nof mutation-mutation towards a definite goal, it may be--but still\nmutation.\nMathematicians can solve problems with two variables. On the Newtonian\ntheory, for instance, acceleration varies with distance, but distance\nalso varies with acceleration. In the realm of truth-processes facts\ncome independently and determine our beliefs provisionally. But these\nbeliefs make us act, and as fast as they do so, they bring into sight or\ninto existence new facts which re-determine the beliefs accordingly. So\nthe whole coil and ball of truth, as it rolls up, is the product of a\ndouble influence. Truths emerge from facts; but they dip forward into\nfacts again and add to them; which facts again create or reveal new\ntruth (the word is indifferent) and so on indefinitely. The 'facts'\nthemselves meanwhile are not TRUE. They simply ARE. Truth is the\nfunction of the beliefs that start and terminate among them.\nThe case is like a snowball's growth, due as it is to the distribution\nof the snow on the one hand, and to the successive pushes of the boys on\nthe other, with these factors co-determining each other incessantly.\nThe most fateful point of difference between being a rationalist and\nbeing a pragmatist is now fully in sight. Experience is in mutation,\nand our psychological ascertainments of truth are in mutation--so much\nrationalism will allow; but never that either reality itself or truth\nitself is mutable. Reality stands complete and ready-made from all\neternity, rationalism insists, and the agreement of our ideas with it\nis that unique unanalyzable virtue in them of which she has already told\nus. As that intrinsic excellence, their truth has nothing to do with our\nexperiences. It adds nothing to the content of experience. It makes\nno difference to reality itself; it is supervenient, inert, static, a\nreflexion merely. It doesn't EXIST, it HOLDS or OBTAINS, it belongs to\nanother dimension from that of either facts or fact-relations, belongs,\nin short, to the epistemological dimension--and with that big word\nrationalism closes the discussion.\nThus, just as pragmatism faces forward to the future, so does\nrationalism here again face backward to a past eternity. True to her\ninveterate habit, rationalism reverts to 'principles,' and thinks that\nwhen an abstraction once is named, we own an oracular solution.\nThe tremendous pregnancy in the way of consequences for life of this\nradical difference of outlook will only become apparent in my later\nlectures. I wish meanwhile to close this lecture by showing that\nrationalism's sublimity does not save it from inanity.\nWhen, namely, you ask rationalists, instead of accusing pragmatism\nof desecrating the notion of truth, to define it themselves by saying\nexactly what THEY understand by it, the only positive attempts I can\nthink of are these two:\n1. \"Truth is just the system of propositions which have an\nun-conditional claim to be recognized as valid.\" [Footnote: A. E.\nTaylor, Philosophical Review, vol. xiv, p. 288.]\n2. Truth is a name for all those judgments which we find ourselves under\nobligation to make by a kind of imperative duty. [Footnote: H.\nRickert, Der Gegenstand der Erkenntniss, chapter on 'Die\nUrtheilsnothwendigkeit.']\nThe first thing that strikes one in such definitions is their\nunutterable triviality. They are absolutely true, of course, but\nabsolutely insignificant until you handle them pragmatically. What do\nyou mean by 'claim' here, and what do you mean by 'duty'? As\nsummary names for the concrete reasons why thinking in true ways is\noverwhelmingly expedient and good for mortal men, it is all right to\ntalk of claims on reality's part to be agreed with, and of obligations\non our part to agree. We feel both the claims and the obligations, and\nwe feel them for just those reasons.\nBut the rationalists who talk of claim and obligation EXPRESSLY SAY\nTHAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR PRACTICAL INTERESTS OR PERSONAL\nREASONS. Our reasons for agreeing are psychological facts, they say,\nrelative to each thinker, and to the accidents of his life. They are his\nevidence merely, they are no part of the life of truth itself. That\nlife transacts itself in a purely logical or epistemological, as\ndistinguished from a psychological, dimension, and its claims antedate\nand exceed all personal motivations whatsoever. Tho neither man nor God\nshould ever ascertain truth, the word would still have to be defined as\nthat which OUGHT to be ascertained and recognized.\nThere never was a more exquisite example of an idea abstracted from the\nconcretes of experience and then used to oppose and negate what it was\nabstracted from.\nPhilosophy and common life abound in similar instances. The\n'sentimentalist fallacy' is to shed tears over abstract justice and\ngenerosity, beauty, etc., and never to know these qualities when you\nmeet them in the street, because there the circumstances make them\nvulgar. Thus I read in the privately printed biography of an eminently\nrationalistic mind: \"It was strange that with such admiration for beauty\nin the abstract, my brother had no enthusiasm for fine architecture, for\nbeautiful painting, or for flowers.\" And in almost the last philosophic\nwork I have read, I find such passages as the following: \"Justice\nis ideal, solely ideal. Reason conceives that it ought to exist, but\nexperience shows that it can-not. ... Truth, which ought to be, cannot\nbe. ... Reason is deformed by experience. As soon as reason enters\nexperience, it becomes contrary to reason.\"\nThe rationalist's fallacy here is exactly like the sentimentalist's.\nBoth extract a quality from the muddy particulars of experience, and\nfind it so pure when extracted that they contrast it with each and all\nits muddy instances as an opposite and higher nature. All the while it\nis THEIR nature. It is the nature of truths to be validated, verified.\nIt pays for our ideas to be validated. Our obligation to seek truth is\npart of our general obligation to do what pays. The payments true ideas\nbring are the sole why of our duty to follow them.\nIdentical whys exist in the case of wealth and health. Truth makes no\nother kind of claim and imposes no other kind of ought than health and\nwealth do. All these claims are conditional; the concrete benefits we\ngain are what we mean by calling the pursuit a duty. In the case of\ntruth, untrue beliefs work as perniciously in the long run as true\nbeliefs work beneficially. Talking abstractly, the quality 'true' may\nthus be said to grow absolutely precious, and the quality 'untrue'\nabsolutely damnable: the one may be called good, the other bad,\nunconditionally. We ought to think the true, we ought to shun the false,\nimperatively.\nBut if we treat all this abstraction literally and oppose it to its\nmother soil in experience, see what a preposterous position we work\nourselves into.\nWe cannot then take a step forward in our actual thinking. When shall\nI acknowledge this truth and when that? Shall the acknowledgment be\nloud?--or silent? If sometimes loud, sometimes silent, which NOW? When\nmay a truth go into cold-storage in the encyclopedia? and when shall it\ncome out for battle? Must I constantly be repeating the truth 'twice\ntwo are four' because of its eternal claim on recognition? or is\nit sometimes irrelevant? Must my thoughts dwell night and day on my\npersonal sins and blemishes, because I truly have them?--or may I sink\nand ignore them in order to be a decent social unit, and not a mass of\nmorbid melancholy and apology?\nIt is quite evident that our obligation to acknowledge truth, so far\nfrom being unconditional, is tremendously conditioned. Truth with a big\nT, and in the singular, claims abstractly to be recognized, of course;\nbut concrete truths in the plural need be recognized only when their\nrecognition is expedient. A truth must always be preferred to a\nfalsehood when both relate to the situation; but when neither does,\ntruth is as little of a duty as falsehood. If you ask me what o'clock it\nis and I tell you that I live at 95 Irving Street, my answer may indeed\nbe true, but you don't see why it is my duty to give it. A false address\nwould be as much to the purpose.\nWith this admission that there are conditions that limit the application\nof the abstract imperative, THE PRAGMATISTIC TREATMENT OF TRUTH SWEEPS\nBACK UPON US IN ITS FULNESS. Our duty to agree with reality is seen to\nbe grounded in a perfect jungle of concrete expediencies.\nWhen Berkeley had explained what people meant by matter, people thought\nthat he denied matter's existence. When Messrs. Schiller and Dewey\nnow explain what people mean by truth, they are accused of denying ITS\nexistence. These pragmatists destroy all objective standards, critics\nsay, and put foolishness and wisdom on one level. A favorite formula for\ndescribing Mr. Schiller's doctrines and mine is that we are persons who\nthink that by saying whatever you find it pleasant to say and calling it\ntruth you fulfil every pragmatistic requirement.\nI leave it to you to judge whether this be not an impudent slander. Pent\nin, as the pragmatist more than anyone else sees himself to be, between\nthe whole body of funded truths squeezed from the past and the coercions\nof the world of sense about him, who so well as he feels the immense\npressure of objective control under which our minds perform their\noperations? If anyone imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its\ncommandment one day, says Emerson. We have heard much of late of the\nuses of the imagination in science. It is high time to urge the use of\na little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our\ncritics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our\nstatements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know\nin recent philosophic history. Schiller says the true is that which\n'works.' Thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to\nthe lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives\n'satisfaction.' He is treated as one who believes in calling everything\ntrue which, if it were true, would be pleasant.\nOur critics certainly need more imagination of realities. I have\nhonestly tried to stretch my own imagination and to read the best\npossible meaning into the rationalist conception, but I have to confess\nthat it still completely baffles me. The notion of a reality calling on\nus to 'agree' with it, and that for no reasons, but simply because\nits claim is 'unconditional' or 'transcendent,' is one that I can make\nneither head nor tail of. I try to imagine myself as the sole reality\nin the world, and then to imagine what more I would 'claim' if I were\nallowed to. If you suggest the possibility of my claiming that a mind\nshould come into being from out of the void inane and stand and COPY me,\nI can indeed imagine what the copying might mean, but I can conjure up\nno motive. What good it would do me to be copied, or what good it would\ndo that mind to copy me, if farther consequences are expressly and\nin principle ruled out as motives for the claim (as they are by our\nrationalist authorities) I cannot fathom. When the Irishman's admirers\nran him along to the place of banquet in a sedan chair with no bottom,\nhe said, \"Faith, if it wasn't for the honor of the thing, I might as\nwell have come on foot.\" So here: but for the honor of the thing, I\nmight as well have remained uncopied. Copying is one genuine mode\nof knowing (which for some strange reason our contemporary\ntranscendentalists seem to be tumbling over each other to repudiate);\nbut when we get beyond copying, and fall back on unnamed forms of\nagreeing that are expressly denied to be either copyings or leadings or\nfittings, or any other processes pragmatically definable, the WHAT of\nthe 'agreement' claimed becomes as unintelligible as the why of it.\nNeither content nor motive can be imagined for it. It is an absolutely\nmeaningless abstraction. [Footnote: I am not forgetting that Professor\nRickert long ago gave up the whole notion of truth being founded on\nagreement with reality. Reality, according to him, is whatever agrees\nwith truth, and truth is founded solely on our primal duty. This\nfantastic flight, together with Mr. Joachim's candid confession of\nfailure in his book The Nature of Truth, seems to me to mark the\nbankruptcy of rationalism when dealing with this subject. Rickert deals\nwith part of the pragmatistic position under the head of what he calls\n'Relativismus.' I cannot discuss his text here. Suffice it to say\nthat his argumentation in that chapter is so feeble as to seem almost\nincredible in so generally able a writer.]\nSurely in this field of truth it is the pragmatists and not the\nrationalists who are the more genuine defenders of the universe's\nrationality.\nLecture VII\nPragmatism and Humanism\nWhat hardens the heart of everyone I approach with the view of truth\nsketched in my last lecture is that typical idol of the tribe, the\nnotion of THE Truth, conceived as the one answer, determinate and\ncomplete, to the one fixed enigma which the world is believed to\npropound. For popular tradition, it is all the better if the answer\nbe oracular, so as itself to awaken wonder as an enigma of the second\norder, veiling rather than revealing what its profundities are supposed\nto contain. All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle,\nsuch as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the\nDialectic Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration\nthat men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in\nphilosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as\na queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a\nmonotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect\nidol of the rationalistic mind! I read in an old letter--from a gifted\nfriend who died too young--these words: \"In everything, in science, art,\nmorals and religion, there MUST be one system that is right and EVERY\nother wrong.\" How characteristic of the enthusiasm of a certain stage of\nyouth! At twenty-one we rise to such a challenge and expect to find the\nsystem. It never occurs to most of us even later that the question 'what\nis THE truth?' is no real question (being irrelative to all conditions)\nand that the whole notion of THE truth is an abstraction from the fact\nof truths in the plural, a mere useful summarizing phrase like THE Latin\nLanguage or THE Law.\nCommon-law judges sometimes talk about the law, and school-masters talk\nabout the latin tongue, in a way to make their hearers think they mean\nentities pre-existent to the decisions or to the words and syntax,\ndetermining them unequivocally and requiring them to obey. But the\nslightest exercise of reflexion makes us see that, instead of being\nprinciples of this kind, both law and latin are results. Distinctions\nbetween the lawful and the unlawful in conduct, or between the\ncorrect and incorrect in speech, have grown up incidentally among the\ninteractions of men's experiences in detail; and in no other way do\ndistinctions between the true and the false in belief ever grow up.\nTruth grafts itself on previous truth, modifying it in the process, just\nas idiom grafts itself on previous idiom, and law on previous law. Given\nprevious law and a novel case, and the judge will twist them into fresh\nlaw. Previous idiom; new slang or metaphor or oddity that hits the\npublic taste:--and presto, a new idiom is made. Previous truth; fresh\nfacts:--and our mind finds a new truth.\nAll the while, however, we pretend that the eternal is unrolling, that\nthe one previous justice, grammar or truth is simply fulgurating, and\nnot being made. But imagine a youth in the courtroom trying cases with\nhis abstract notion of 'the' law, or a censor of speech let loose\namong the theatres with his idea of 'the' mother-tongue, or a professor\nsetting up to lecture on the actual universe with his rationalistic\nnotion of 'the Truth' with a big T, and what progress do they make?\nTruth, law, and language fairly boil away from them at the least touch\nof novel fact. These things MAKE THEMSELVES as we go. Our rights,\nwrongs, prohibitions, penalties, words, forms, idioms, beliefs, are so\nmany new creations that add themselves as fast as history proceeds.\nFar from being antecedent principles that animate the process, law,\nlanguage, truth are but abstract names for its results.\nLaws and languages at any rate are thus seen to be man-made: things.\nMr. Schiller applies the analogy to beliefs, and proposes the name of\n'Humanism' for the doctrine that to an unascertainable extent our truths\nare man-made products too. Human motives sharpen all our questions,\nhuman satisfactions lurk in all our answers, all our formulas have a\nhuman twist. This element is so inextricable in the products that Mr.\nSchiller sometimes seems almost to leave it an open question whether\nthere be anything else. \"The world,\" he says, \"is essentially [u lambda\nnu], it is what we make of it. It is fruitless to define it by what it\noriginally was or by what it is apart from us; it IS what is made of it.\nHence ... the world is PLASTIC.\" [Footnote: Personal Idealism, p. 60.]\nHe adds that we can learn the limits of the plasticity only by trying,\nand that we ought to start as if it were wholly plastic, acting\nmethodically on that assumption, and stopping only when we are\ndecisively rebuked.\nThis is Mr. Schiller's butt-end-foremost statement of the humanist\nposition, and it has exposed him to severe attack. I mean to defend the\nhumanist position in this lecture, so I will insinuate a few remarks at\nthis point.\nMr. Schiller admits as emphatically as anyone the presence of resisting\nfactors in every actual experience of truth-making, of which the\nnew-made special truth must take account, and with which it has perforce\nto 'agree.' All our truths are beliefs about 'Reality'; and in any\nparticular belief the reality acts as something independent, as a thing\nFOUND, not manufactured. Let me here recall a bit of my last lecture.\n'REALITY' IS IN GENERAL WHAT TRUTHS HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF; [Footnote:\nMr. Taylor in his Elements of Metaphysics uses this excellent pragmatic\ndefinition.] and the FIRST part of reality from this point of view is\nthe flux of our sensations. Sensations are forced upon us, coming we\nknow not whence. Over their nature, order, and quantity we have as good\nas no control. THEY are neither true nor false; they simply ARE. It is\nonly what we say about them, only the names we give them, our theories\nof their source and nature and remote relations, that may be true or\nnot.\nThe SECOND part of reality, as something that our beliefs must also\nobediently take account of, is the RELATIONS that obtain between our\nsensations or between their copies in our minds. This part falls into\ntwo sub-parts: 1) the relations that are mutable and accidental, as\nthose of date and place; and 2) those that are fixed and essential\nbecause they are grounded on the inner natures of their terms--such as\nlikeness and unlikeness. Both sorts of relation are matters of immediate\nperception. Both are 'facts.' But it is the latter kind of fact that\nforms the more important sub-part of reality for our theories of\nknowledge. Inner relations namely are 'eternal,' are perceived whenever\ntheir sensible terms are compared; and of them our thought--mathematical\nand logical thought, so-called--must eternally take account.\nThe THIRD part of reality, additional to these perceptions (tho largely\nbased upon them), is the PREVIOUS TRUTHS of which every new inquiry\ntakes account. This third part is a much less obdurately resisting\nfactor: it often ends by giving way. In speaking of these three portions\nof reality as at all times controlling our belief's formation, I am only\nreminding you of what we heard in our last hour.\nNow however fixed these elements of reality may be, we still have a\ncertain freedom in our dealings with them. Take our sensations. THAT\nthey are is undoubtedly beyond our control; but WHICH we attend to,\nnote, and make emphatic in our conclusions depends on our own interests;\nand, according as we lay the emphasis here or there, quite different\nformulations of truth result. We read the same facts differently.\n'Waterloo,' with the same fixed details, spells a 'victory' for an\nenglishman; for a frenchman it spells a 'defeat.' So, for an optimist\nphilosopher the universe spells victory, for a pessimist, defeat.\nWhat we say about reality thus depends on the perspective into which we\nthrow it. The THAT of it is its own; but the WHAT depends on the WHICH;\nand the which depends on US. Both the sensational and the relational\nparts of reality are dumb: they say absolutely nothing about themselves.\nWe it is who have to speak for them. This dumbness of sensations has\nled such intellectualists as T.H. Green and Edward Caird to shove them\nalmost beyond the pale of philosophic recognition, but pragmatists\nrefuse to go so far. A sensation is rather like a client who has given\nhis case to a lawyer and then has passively to listen in the courtroom\nto whatever account of his affairs, pleasant or unpleasant, the lawyer\nfinds it most expedient to give.\nHence, even in the field of sensation, our minds exert a certain\narbitrary choice. By our inclusions and omissions we trace the field's\nextent; by our emphasis we mark its foreground and its background; by\nour order we read it in this direction or in that. We receive in short\nthe block of marble, but we carve the statue ourselves.\nThis applies to the 'eternal' parts of reality as well: we shuffle our\nperceptions of intrinsic relation and arrange them just as freely. We\nread them in one serial order or another, class them in this way or\nin that, treat one or the other as more fundamental, until our beliefs\nabout them form those bodies of truth known as logics, geometries, or\narithmetics, in each and all of which the form and order in which the\nwhole is cast is flagrantly man-made.\nThus, to say nothing of the new FACTS which men add to the matter of\nreality by the acts of their own lives, they have already impressed\ntheir mental forms on that whole third of reality which I have called\n'previous truths.' Every hour brings its new percepts, its own facts of\nsensation and relation, to be truly taken account of; but the whole\nof our PAST dealings with such facts is already funded in the previous\ntruths. It is therefore only the smallest and recentest fraction of the\nfirst two parts of reality that comes to us without the human touch, and\nthat fraction has immediately to become humanized in the sense of being\nsquared, assimilated, or in some way adapted, to the humanized mass\nalready there. As a matter of fact we can hardly take in an impression\nat all, in the absence of a pre-conception of what impressions there may\npossibly be.\nWhen we talk of reality 'independent' of human thinking, then, it seems\na thing very hard to find. It reduces to the notion of what is just\nentering into experience, and yet to be named, or else to some imagined\naboriginal presence in experience, before any belief about the presence\nhad arisen, before any human conception had been applied. It is what is\nabsolutely dumb and evanescent, the merely ideal limit of our minds.\nWe may glimpse it, but we never grasp it; what we grasp is always some\nsubstitute for it which previous human thinking has peptonized and\ncooked for our consumption. If so vulgar an expression were allowed us,\nwe might say that wherever we find it, it has been already FAKED. This\nis what Mr. Schiller has in mind when he calls independent reality a\nmere unresisting [u lambda nu], which IS only to be made over by us.\nThat is Mr. Schiller's belief about the sensible core of reality.\nWe 'encounter' it (in Mr. Bradley's words) but don't possess it.\nSuperficially this sounds like Kant's view; but between categories\nfulminated before nature began, and categories gradually forming\nthemselves in nature's presence, the whole chasm between rationalism and\nempiricism yawns. To the genuine 'Kantianer' Schiller will always be to\nKant as a satyr to Hyperion.\nOther pragmatists may reach more positive beliefs about the sensible\ncore of reality. They may think to get at it in its independent nature,\nby peeling off the successive man-made wrappings. They may make theories\nthat tell us where it comes from and all about it; and if these theories\nwork satisfactorily they will be true. The transcendental idealists say\nthere is no core, the finally completed wrapping being reality and truth\nin one. Scholasticism still teaches that the core is 'matter.' Professor\nBergson, Heymans, Strong, and others, believe in the core and bravely\ntry to define it. Messrs. Dewey and Schiller treat it as a 'limit.'\nWhich is the truer of all these diverse accounts, or of others\ncomparable with them, unless it be the one that finally proves the most\nsatisfactory? On the one hand there will stand reality, on the other\nan account of it which proves impossible to better or to alter. If\nthe impossibility prove permanent, the truth of the account will be\nabsolute. Other content of truth than this I can find nowhere. If the\nanti-pragmatists have any other meaning, let them for heaven's sake\nreveal it, let them grant us access to it!\nNot BEING reality, but only our belief ABOUT reality, it will contain\nhuman elements, but these will KNOW the non-human element, in the only\nsense in which there can be knowledge of anything. Does the river make\nits banks, or do the banks make the river? Does a man walk with his\nright leg or with his left leg more essentially? Just as impossible may\nit be to separate the real from the human factors in the growth of our\ncognitive experience.\nLet this stand as a first brief indication of the humanistic position.\nDoes it seem paradoxical? If so, I will try to make it plausible by a\nfew illustrations, which will lead to a fuller acquaintance with the\nsubject.\nIn many familiar objects everyone will recognize the human element. We\nconceive a given reality in this way or in that, to suit our purpose,\nand the reality passively submits to the conception. You can take the\nnumber 27 as the cube of 3, or as the product of 3 and 9, or as 26 PLUS\n1, or 100 MINUS 73, or in countless other ways, of which one will be\njust as true as another. You can take a chessboard as black squares on\na white ground, or as white squares on a black ground, and neither\nconception is a false one. You can treat the adjoined figure [Figure of\na 'Star of David'] as a star, as two big triangles crossing each other,\nas a hexagon with legs set up on its angles, as six equal triangles\nhanging together by their tips, etc. All these treatments are true\ntreatments--the sensible THAT upon the paper resists no one of them. You\ncan say of a line that it runs east, or you can say that it runs west,\nand the line per se accepts both descriptions without rebelling at the\ninconsistency.\nWe carve out groups of stars in the heavens, and call them\nconstellations, and the stars patiently suffer us to do so--tho if they\nknew what we were doing, some of them might feel much surprised at the\npartners we had given them. We name the same constellation diversely, as\nCharles's Wain, the Great Bear, or the Dipper. None of the names will be\nfalse, and one will be as true as another, for all are applicable.\nIn all these cases we humanly make an addition to some sensible reality,\nand that reality tolerates the addition. All the additions 'agree' with\nthe reality; they fit it, while they build it out. No one of them is\nfalse. Which may be treated as the more true, depends altogether on\nthe human use of it. If the 27 is a number of dollars which I find in\na drawer where I had left 28, it is 28 minus 1. If it is the number of\ninches in a shelf which I wish to insert into a cupboard 26 inches wide,\nit is 26 plus 1. If I wish to ennoble the heavens by the constellations\nI see there, 'Charles's Wain' would be more true than 'Dipper.' My\nfriend Frederick Myers was humorously indignant that that prodigious\nstar-group should remind us Americans of nothing but a culinary utensil.\nWhat shall we call a THING anyhow? It seems quite arbitrary, for we\ncarve out everything, just as we carve out constellations, to suit our\nhuman purposes. For me, this whole 'audience' is one thing, which grows\nnow restless, now attentive. I have no use at present for its individual\nunits, so I don't consider them. So of an 'army,' of a 'nation.' But\nin your own eyes, ladies and gentlemen, to call you 'audience' is an\naccidental way of taking you. The permanently real things for you are\nyour individual persons. To an anatomist, again, those persons are but\norganisms, and the real things are the organs. Not the organs, so much\nas their constituent cells, say the histologists; not the cells, but\ntheir molecules, say in turn the chemists.\nWe break the flux of sensible reality into things, then, at our will. We\ncreate the subjects of our true as well as of our false propositions.\nWe create the predicates also. Many of the predicates of things express\nonly the relations of the things to us and to our feelings. Such\npredicates of course are human additions. Caesar crossed the Rubicon,\nand was a menace to Rome's freedom. He is also an American school-room\npest, made into one by the reaction of our schoolboys on his writings.\nThe added predicate is as true of him as the earlier ones.\nYou see how naturally one comes to the humanistic principle: you can't\nweed out the human contribution. Our nouns and adjectives are all\nhumanized heirlooms, and in the theories we build them into, the inner\norder and arrangement is wholly dictated by human considerations,\nintellectual consistency being one of them. Mathematics and logic\nthemselves are fermenting with human rearrangements; physics, astronomy\nand biology follow massive cues of preference. We plunge forward into\nthe field of fresh experience with the beliefs our ancestors and we have\nmade already; these determine what we notice; what we notice determines\nwhat we do; what we do again determines what we experience; so from\none thing to another, altho the stubborn fact remains that there IS a\nsensible flux, what is true of it seems from first to last to be largely\na matter of our own creation.\nWe build the flux out inevitably. The great question is: does it,\nwith our additions, rise or fall in value? Are the additions WORTHY or\nUNWORTHY? Suppose a universe composed of seven stars, and nothing else\nbut three human witnesses and their critic. One witness names the\nstars 'Great Bear'; one calls them 'Charles's Wain'; one calls them the\n'Dipper.' Which human addition has made the best universe of the given\nstellar material? If Frederick Myers were the critic, he would have no\nhesitation in 'turning-down' the American witness.\nLotze has in several places made a deep suggestion. We naively assume,\nhe says, a relation between reality and our minds which may be just the\nopposite of the true one. Reality, we naturally think, stands ready-made\nand complete, and our intellects supervene with the one simple duty\nof describing it as it is already. But may not our descriptions, Lotze\nasks, be themselves important additions to reality? And may not previous\nreality itself be there, far less for the purpose of reappearing\nunaltered in our knowledge, than for the very purpose of stimulating\nour minds to such additions as shall enhance the universe's total value.\n\"Die erhohung des vorgefundenen daseins\" is a phrase used by Professor\nEucken somewhere, which reminds one of this suggestion by the great\nLotze.\nIt is identically our pragmatistic conception. In our cognitive as well\nas in our active life we are creative. We ADD, both to the subject and\nto the predicate part of reality. The world stands really malleable,\nwaiting to receive its final touches at our hands. Like the kingdom of\nheaven, it suffers human violence willingly. Man ENGENDERS truths upon\nit.\nNo one can deny that such a role would add both to our dignity and to\nour responsibility as thinkers. To some of us it proves a most inspiring\nnotion. Signer Papini, the leader of italian pragmatism, grows fairly\ndithyrambic over the view that it opens, of man's divinely-creative\nfunctions.\nThe import of the difference between pragmatism and rationalism is now\nin sight throughout its whole extent. The essential contrast is that for\nrationalism reality is ready-made and complete from all eternity,\nwhile for pragmatism it is still in the making, and awaits part of its\ncomplexion from the future. On the one side the universe is absolutely\nsecure, on the other it is still pursuing its adventures.\nWe have got into rather deep water with this humanistic view, and it is\nno wonder that misunderstanding gathers round it. It is accused of being\na doctrine of caprice. Mr. Bradley, for example, says that a humanist,\nif he understood his own doctrine, would have to \"hold any end however\nperverted to be rational if I insist on it personally, and any idea\nhowever mad to be the truth if only some one is resolved that he will\nhave it so.\" The humanist view of 'reality,' as something resisting, yet\nmalleable, which controls our thinking as an energy that must be\ntaken 'account' of incessantly (tho not necessarily merely COPIED) is\nevidently a difficult one to introduce to novices. The situation reminds\nme of one that I have personally gone through. I once wrote an essay on\nour right to believe, which I unluckily called the WILL to Believe.\nAll the critics, neglecting the essay, pounced upon the title.\nPsychologically it was impossible, morally it was iniquitous. The\n\"will to deceive,\" the \"will to make-believe,\" were wittily proposed as\nsubstitutes for it.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN PRAGMATISM AND RATIONALISM, IN THE SHAPE IN\nWHICH WE NOW HAVE IT BEFORE US, IS NO LONGER A QUESTION IN THE THEORY OF\nKNOWLEDGE, IT CONCERNS THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF.\nOn the pragmatist side we have only one edition of the universe,\nunfinished, growing in all sorts of places, especially in the places\nwhere thinking beings are at work.\nOn the rationalist side we have a universe in many editions, one real\none, the infinite folio, or edition de luxe, eternally complete; and\nthen the various finite editions, full of false readings, distorted and\nmutilated each in its own way.\nSo the rival metaphysical hypotheses of pluralism and monism here come\nback upon us. I will develope their differences during the remainder of\nour hour.\nAnd first let me say that it is impossible not to see a temperamental\ndifference at work in the choice of sides. The rationalist mind,\nradically taken, is of a doctrinaire and authoritative complexion: the\nphrase 'must be' is ever on its lips. The belly-band of its\nuniverse must be tight. A radical pragmatist on the other hand is a\nhappy-go-lucky anarchistic sort of creature. If he had to live in a tub\nlike Diogenes he wouldn't mind at all if the hoops were loose and the\nstaves let in the sun.\nNow the idea of this loose universe affects your typical rationalists\nin much the same way as 'freedom of the press' might affect a veteran\nofficial in the russian bureau of censorship; or as 'simplified\nspelling' might affect an elderly schoolmistress. It affects him as\nthe swarm of protestant sects affects a papist onlooker. It appears\nas backboneless and devoid of principle as 'opportunism' in politics\nappears to an old-fashioned french legitimist, or to a fanatical\nbeliever in the divine right of the people.\nFor pluralistic pragmatism, truth grows up inside of all the finite\nexperiences. They lean on each other, but the whole of them, if such a\nwhole there be, leans on nothing. All 'homes' are in finite experience;\nfinite experience as such is homeless. Nothing outside of the flux\nsecures the issue of it. It can hope salvation only from its own\nintrinsic promises and potencies.\nTo rationalists this describes a tramp and vagrant world, adrift in\nspace, with neither elephant nor tortoise to plant the sole of its foot\nupon. It is a set of stars hurled into heaven without even a centre of\ngravity to pull against. In other spheres of life it is true that we\nhave got used to living in a state of relative insecurity. The authority\nof 'the State,' and that of an absolute 'moral law,' have resolved\nthemselves into expediencies, and holy church has resolved itself into\n'meeting-houses.' Not so as yet within the philosophic class-rooms.\nA universe with such as US contributing to create its truth, a world\ndelivered to OUR opportunisms and OUR private judgments! Home-rule for\nIreland would be a millennium in comparison. We're no more fit for such\na part than the Filipinos are 'fit for self-government.' Such a world\nwould not be RESPECTABLE, philosophically. It is a trunk without a tag,\na dog without a collar, in the eyes of most professors of philosophy.\nWhat then would tighten this loose universe, according to the\nprofessors?\nSomething to support the finite many, to tie it to, to unify and anchor\nit. Something unexposed to accident, something eternal and unalterable.\nThe mutable in experience must be founded on immutability. Behind our de\nfacto world, our world in act, there must be a de jure duplicate fixed\nand previous, with all that can happen here already there in posse,\nevery drop of blood, every smallest item, appointed and provided,\nstamped and branded, without chance of variation. The negatives that\nhaunt our ideals here below must be themselves negated in the absolutely\nReal. This alone makes the universe solid. This is the resting deep.\nWe live upon the stormy surface; but with this our anchor holds, for it\ngrapples rocky bottom. This is Wordsworth's \"central peace subsisting at\nthe heart of endless agitation.\" This is Vivekananda's mystical One of\nwhich I read to you. This is Reality with the big R, reality that makes\nthe timeless claim, reality to which defeat can't happen. This is\nwhat the men of principles, and in general all the men whom I called\ntender-minded in my first lecture, think themselves obliged to\npostulate.\nAnd this, exactly this, is what the tough-minded of that lecture find\nthemselves moved to call a piece of perverse abstraction-worship. The\ntough-minded are the men whose alpha and omega are FACTS. Behind the\nbare phenomenal facts, as my tough-minded old friend Chauncey Wright,\nthe great Harvard empiricist of my youth, used to say, there is NOTHING.\nWhen a rationalist insists that behind the facts there is the GROUND of\nthe facts, the POSSIBILITY of the facts, the tougher empiricists accuse\nhim of taking the mere name and nature of a fact and clapping it behind\nthe fact as a duplicate entity to make it possible. That such sham\ngrounds are often invoked is notorious. At a surgical operation I heard\na bystander ask a doctor why the patient breathed so deeply. \"Because\nether is a respiratory stimulant,\" the doctor answered. \"Ah!\" said the\nquestioner, as if relieved by the explanation. But this is like saying\nthat cyanide of potassium kills because it is a 'poison,' or that it is\nso cold to-night because it is 'winter,' or that we have five fingers\nbecause we are 'pentadactyls.' These are but names for the facts,\ntaken from the facts, and then treated as previous and explanatory.\nThe tender-minded notion of an absolute reality is, according to the\nradically tough-minded, framed on just this pattern. It is but our\nsummarizing name for the whole spread-out and strung-along mass of\nphenomena, treated as if it were a different entity, both one and\nprevious.\nYou see how differently people take things. The world we live in exists\ndiffused and distributed, in the form of an indefinitely numerous lot of\neaches, coherent in all sorts of ways and degrees; and the tough-minded\nare perfectly willing to keep them at that valuation. They can stand\nthat kind of world, their temper being well adapted to its insecurity.\nNot so the tender-minded party. They must back the world we find\nourselves born into by \"another and a better\" world in which the eaches\nform an All and the All a One that logically presupposes, co-implicates,\nand secures each EACH without exception.\nMust we as pragmatists be radically tough-minded? or can we treat\nthe absolute edition of the world as a legitimate hypothesis? It is\ncertainly legitimate, for it is thinkable, whether we take it in its\nabstract or in its concrete shape.\nBy taking it abstractly I mean placing it behind our finite life as we\nplace the word 'winter' behind to-night's cold weather. 'Winter' is\nonly the name for a certain number of days which we find generally\ncharacterized by cold weather, but it guarantees nothing in that line,\nfor our thermometer to-morrow may soar into the 70's. Nevertheless\nthe word is a useful one to plunge forward with into the stream of our\nexperience. It cuts off certain probabilities and sets up others: you\ncan put away your straw-hats; you can unpack your arctics. It is a\nsummary of things to look for. It names a part of nature's habits,\nand gets you ready for their continuation. It is a definite instrument\nabstracted from experience, a conceptual reality that you must take\naccount of, and which reflects you totally back into sensible\nrealities. The pragmatist is the last person to deny the reality of such\nabstractions. They are so much past experience funded.\nBut taking the absolute edition of the world concretely means a\ndifferent hypothesis. Rationalists take it concretely and OPPOSE it to\nthe world's finite editions. They give it a particular nature. It is\nperfect, finished. Everything known there is known along with everything\nelse; here, where ignorance reigns, far otherwise. If there is want\nthere, there also is the satisfaction provided. Here all is process;\nthat world is timeless. Possibilities obtain in our world; in the\nabsolute world, where all that is NOT is from eternity impossible,\nand all that IS is necessary, the category of possibility has no\napplication. In this world crimes and horrors are regrettable. In that\ntotalized world regret obtains not, for \"the existence of ill in the\ntemporal order is the very condition of the perfection of the eternal\norder.\"\nOnce more, either hypothesis is legitimate in pragmatist eyes, for\neither has its uses. Abstractly, or taken like the word winter, as a\nmemorandum of past experience that orients us towards the future, the\nnotion of the absolute world is indispensable. Concretely taken, it is\nalso indispensable, at least to certain minds, for it determines them\nreligiously, being often a thing to change their lives by, and by\nchanging their lives, to change whatever in the outer order depends on\nthem.\nWe cannot therefore methodically join the tough minds in their rejection\nof the whole notion of a world beyond our finite experience. One\nmisunderstanding of pragmatism is to identify it with positivistic\ntough-mindedness, to suppose that it scorns every rationalistic notion\nas so much jabber and gesticulation, that it loves intellectual anarchy\nas such and prefers a sort of wolf-world absolutely unpent and wild\nand without a master or a collar to any philosophic class-room\nproduct, whatsoever. I have said so much in these lectures against\nthe over-tender forms of rationalism, that I am prepared for some\nmisunderstanding here, but I confess that the amount of it that I have\nfound in this very audience surprises me, for I have simultaneously\ndefended rationalistic hypotheses so far as these re-direct you\nfruitfully into experience.\nFor instance I receive this morning this question on a post-card: \"Is a\npragmatist necessarily a complete materialist and agnostic?\" One of my\noldest friends, who ought to know me better, writes me a letter that\naccuses the pragmatism I am recommending, of shutting out all wider\nmetaphysical views and condemning us to the most terre-a-terre\nnaturalism. Let me read you some extracts from it.\n\"It seems to me,\" my friend writes, \"that the pragmatic objection to\npragmatism lies in the fact that it might accentuate the narrowness of\nnarrow minds.\n\"Your call to the rejection of the namby-pamby and the wishy-washy is of\ncourse inspiring. But although it is salutary and stimulating to be told\nthat one should be responsible for the immediate issues and bearings\nof his words and thoughts, I decline to be deprived of the pleasure and\nprofit of dwelling also on remoter bearings and issues, and it is the\nTENDENCY of pragmatism to refuse this privilege.\n\"In short, it seems to me that the limitations, or rather the dangers,\nof the pragmatic tendency, are analogous to those which beset the unwary\nfollowers of the 'natural sciences.' Chemistry and physics are eminently\npragmatic and many of their devotees, smugly content with the data that\ntheir weights and measures furnish, feel an infinite pity and disdain\nfor all students of philosophy and meta-physics, whomsoever. And\nof course everything can be expressed--after a fashion, and\n'theoretically'--in terms of chemistry and physics, that is, EVERYTHING\nEXCEPT THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE, and that, they say, there is no\npragmatic use in trying to express; it has no bearings--FOR THEM. I for\nmy part refuse to be persuaded that we cannot look beyond the obvious\npluralism of the naturalist and the pragmatist to a logical unity in\nwhich they take no interest.\"\nHow is such a conception of the pragmatism I am advocating possible,\nafter my first and second lectures? I have all along been offering it\nexpressly as a mediator between tough-mindedness and tender-mindedness.\nIf the notion of a world ante rem, whether taken abstractly like the\nword winter, or concretely as the hypothesis of an Absolute, can be\nshown to have any consequences whatever for our life, it has a meaning.\nIf the meaning works, it will have SOME truth that ought to be held to\nthrough all possible reformulations, for pragmatism.\nThe absolutistic hypothesis, that perfection is eternal, aboriginal, and\nmost real, has a perfectly definite meaning, and it works religiously.\nTo examine how, will be the subject of my next and final lecture.\nLecture VIII\nPragmatism and Religion\nAt the close of the last lecture I reminded you of the first one,\nin which I had opposed tough-mindedness to tender-mindedness and\nrecommended pragmatism as their mediator. Tough-mindedness positively\nrejects tender-mindedness's hypothesis of an eternal perfect edition of\nthe universe coexisting with our finite experience.\nOn pragmatic principles we cannot reject any hypothesis if consequences\nuseful to life flow from it. Universal conceptions, as things to take\naccount of, may be as real for pragmatism as particular sensations are.\nThey have indeed no meaning and no reality if they have no use. But if\nthey have any use they have that amount of meaning. And the meaning will\nbe true if the use squares well with life's other uses.\nWell, the use of the Absolute is proved by the whole course of\nmen's religious history. The eternal arms are then beneath. Remember\nVivekananda's use of the Atman: it is indeed not a scientific use,\nfor we can make no particular deductions from it. It is emotional and\nspiritual altogether.\nIt is always best to discuss things by the help of concrete examples.\nLet me read therefore some of those verses entitled \"To You\" by Walt\nWhitman--\"You\" of course meaning the reader or hearer of the poem\nwhosoever he or she may be.\nWhoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my poem; I\nwhisper with my lips close to your ear, I have loved many women and men,\nbut I love none better than you.\nO I have been dilatory and dumb; I should have made my way straight\nto you long ago; I should have blabb'd nothing but you, I should have\nchanted nothing but you.\nI will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you; None have\nunderstood you, but I understand you; None have done justice to you--you\nhave not done justice to yourself; None but have found you imperfect--I\nonly find no imperfection in you.\nO I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you! You have not known\nwhat you are--you have slumber'd upon yourself all your life; What you\nhave done returns already in mockeries.\nBut the mockeries are not you; Underneath them, and within them, I see\nyou lurk; I pursue you where none else has pursued you; Silence, the\ndesk, the flippant expression, the night, the accustom'd routine, if\nthese conceal you from others, or from yourself, they do not conceal you\nfrom me; The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if\nthese balk others, they do not balk me, The pert apparel, the deform'd\nattitude, drunkenness, greed, premature death, all these I part aside.\nThere is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you; There\nis no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in you; No\npluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you; No pleasure\nwaiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you.\nWhoever you are! claim your own at any hazard! These shows of the\neast and west are tame, compared to you; These immense meadows--these\ninterminable rivers--you are immense and interminable as they; You are\nhe or she who is master or mistress over them, Master or mistress in\nyour own right over Nature, elements, pain, passion, dissolution.\nThe hopples fall from your ankles--you find an unfailing sufficiency;\nOld or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever\nyou are promulges itself; Through birth, life, death, burial, the means\nare provided, nothing is scanted; Through angers, losses, ambition,\nignorance, ennui, what you are picks its way.\nVerily a fine and moving poem, in any case, but there are two ways of\ntaking it, both useful.\nOne is the monistic way, the mystical way of pure cosmic emotion. The\nglories and grandeurs, they are yours absolutely, even in the midst of\nyour defacements. Whatever may happen to you, whatever you may appear to\nbe, inwardly you are safe. Look back, LIE back, on your true principle\nof being! This is the famous way of quietism, of indifferentism. Its\nenemies compare it to a spiritual opium. Yet pragmatism must respect\nthis way, for it has massive historic vindication.\nBut pragmatism sees another way to be respected also, the pluralistic\nway of interpreting the poem. The you so glorified, to which the hymn\nis sung, may mean your better possibilities phenomenally taken, or the\nspecific redemptive effects even of your failures, upon yourself or\nothers. It may mean your loyalty to the possibilities of others whom you\nadmire and love so, that you are willing to accept your own poor life,\nfor it is that glory's partner. You can at least appreciate, applaud,\nfurnish the audience, of so brave a total world. Forget the low in\nyourself, then, think only of the high. Identify your life therewith;\nthen, through angers, losses, ignorance, ennui, whatever you thus make\nyourself, whatever you thus most deeply are, picks its way.\nIn either way of taking the poem, it encourages fidelity to ourselves.\nBoth ways satisfy; both sanctify the human flux. Both paint the portrait\nof the YOU on a gold-background. But the background of the first way\nis the static One, while in the second way it means possibles in the\nplural, genuine possibles, and it has all the restlessness of that\nconception.\nNoble enough is either way of reading the poem; but plainly the\npluralistic way agrees with the pragmatic temper best, for it\nimmediately suggests an infinitely larger number of the details of\nfuture experience to our mind. It sets definite activities in us at\nwork. Altho this second way seems prosaic and earthborn in comparison\nwith the first way, yet no one can accuse it of tough-mindedness in any\nbrutal sense of the term. Yet if, as pragmatists, you should positively\nset up the second way AGAINST the first way, you would very likely be\nmisunderstood. You would be accused of denying nobler conceptions, and\nof being an ally of tough-mindedness in the worst sense.\nYou remember the letter from a member of this audience from which I read\nsome extracts at our previous meeting. Let me read you an additional\nextract now. It shows a vagueness in realizing the alternatives before\nus which I think is very widespread.\n\"I believe,\" writes my friend and correspondent, \"in pluralism; I\nbelieve that in our search for truth we leap from one floating cake of\nice to another, on an infinite sea, and that by each of our acts we make\nnew truths possible and old ones impossible; I believe that each man is\nresponsible for making the universe better, and that if he does not do\nthis it will be in so far left undone.\n\"Yet at the same time I am willing to endure that my children should be\nincurably sick and suffering (as they are not) and I myself stupid\nand yet with brains enough to see my stupidity, only on one condition,\nnamely, that through the construction, in imagination and by reasoning,\nof a RATIONAL UNITY OF ALL THINGS, I can conceive my acts and my\nthoughts and my troubles as SUPPLEMENTED: BY ALL THE OTHER PHENOMENA\nOF THE WORLD, AND AS FORMING--WHEN THUS SUPPLEMENTED--A SCHEME WHICH I\nAPPROVE AND ADOPT AS MY I OWN; and for my part I refuse to be persuaded\nthat we cannot look beyond the obvious pluralism of the naturalist and\npragmatist to a logical unity in which they take no interest or stock.\"\nSuch a fine expression of personal faith warms the heart of the hearer.\nBut how much does it clear his philosophic head? Does the writer\nconsistently favor the monistic, or the pluralistic, interpretation of\nthe world's poem? His troubles become atoned for WHEN THUS SUPPLEMENTED,\nhe says, supplemented, that is, by all the remedies that THE OTHER\nPHENOMENA may supply. Obviously here the writer faces forward into\nthe particulars of experience, which he interprets in a\npluralistic-melioristic way.\nBut he believes himself to face backward. He speaks of what he calls\nthe rational UNITY of things, when all the while he really means their\npossible empirical UNIFICATION. He supposes at the same time that the\npragmatist, because he criticizes rationalism's abstract One, is cut\noff from the consolation of believing in the saving possibilities of\nthe concrete many. He fails in short to distinguish between taking the\nworld's perfection as a necessary principle, and taking it only as a\npossible terminus ad quem.\nI regard the writer of this letter as a genuine pragmatist, but as a\npragmatist sans le savoir. He appears to me as one of that numerous\nclass of philosophic amateurs whom I spoke of in my first lecture, as\nwishing to have all the good things going, without being too careful\nas to how they agree or disagree. \"Rational unity of all things\" is\nso inspiring a formula, that he brandishes it offhand, and abstractly\naccuses pluralism of conflicting with it (for the bare names do\nconflict), altho concretely he means by it just the pragmatistically\nunified and ameliorated world. Most of us remain in this essential\nvagueness, and it is well that we should; but in the interest of\nclear-headedness it is well that some of us should go farther, so I\nwill try now to focus a little more discriminatingly on this particular\nreligious point.\nIs then this you of yous, this absolutely real world, this unity that\nyields the moral inspiration and has the religious value, to be taken\nmonistically or pluralistically? Is it ante rem or in rebus? Is it a\nprinciple or an end, an absolute or an ultimate, a first or a last? Does\nit make you look forward or lie back? It is certainly worth while not to\nclump the two things together, for if discriminated, they have decidedly\ndiverse meanings for life.\nPlease observe that the whole dilemma revolves pragmatically about the\nnotion of the world's possibilities. Intellectually, rationalism invokes\nits absolute principle of unity as a ground of possibility for the\nmany facts. Emotionally, it sees it as a container and limiter of\npossibilities, a guarantee that the upshot shall be good. Taken in this\nway, the absolute makes all good things certain, and all bad things\nimpossible (in the eternal, namely), and may be said to transmute the\nentire category of possibility into categories more secure. One sees at\nthis point that the great religious difference lies between the men who\ninsist that the world MUST AND SHALL BE, and those who are contented\nwith believing that the world MAY BE, saved. The whole clash of\nrationalistic and empiricist religion is thus over the validity of\npossibility. It is necessary therefore to begin by focusing upon that\nword. What may the word 'possible' definitely mean?\nTo unreflecting men the possible means a sort of third estate of being,\nless real than existence, more real than non-existence, a twilight\nrealm, a hybrid status, a limbo into which and out of which realities\never and anon are made to pass. Such a conception is of course too\nvague and nondescript to satisfy us. Here, as elsewhere, the only way to\nextract a term's meaning is to use the pragmatic method on it. When you\nsay that a thing is possible, what difference does it make?\nIt makes at least this difference that if anyone calls it impossible you\ncan contradict him, if anyone calls it actual you can contradict HIM,\nand if anyone calls it necessary you can contradict him too. But these\nprivileges of contradiction don't amount to much. When you say a thing\nis possible, does not that make some farther difference in terms of\nactual fact?\nIt makes at least this negative difference that if the statement be\ntrue, it follows that there is nothing extant capable of preventing the\npossible thing. The absence of real grounds of interference may thus be\nsaid to make things not impossible, possible therefore in the bare or\nabstract sense.\nBut most possibles are not bare, they are concretely grounded, or\nwell-grounded, as we say. What does this mean pragmatically? It means,\nnot only that there are no preventive conditions present, but that some\nof the conditions of production of the possible thing actually are here.\nThus a concretely possible chicken means: (1) that the idea of chicken\ncontains no essential self-contradiction; (2) that no boys, skunks, or\nother enemies are about; and (3) that at least an actual egg exists.\nPossible chicken means actual egg--plus actual sitting hen, or\nincubator, or what not. As the actual conditions approach completeness\nthe chicken becomes a better-and-better-grounded possibility. When the\nconditions are entirely complete, it ceases to be a possibility, and\nturns into an actual fact.\nLet us apply this notion to the salvation of the world. What does it\npragmatically mean to say that this is possible? It means that some of\nthe conditions of the world's deliverance do actually exist. The more of\nthem there are existent, the fewer preventing conditions you can find,\nthe better-grounded is the salvation's possibility, the more PROBABLE\ndoes the fact of the deliverance become.\nSo much for our preliminary look at possibility.\nNow it would contradict the very spirit of life to say that our minds\nmust be indifferent and neutral in questions like that of the world's\nsalvation. Anyone who pretends to be neutral writes himself down here\nas a fool and a sham. We all do wish to minimize the insecurity of the\nuniverse; we are and ought to be unhappy when we regard it as exposed to\nevery enemy and open to every life-destroying draft. Nevertheless there\nare unhappy men who think the salvation of the world impossible. Theirs\nis the doctrine known as pessimism.\nOptimism in turn would be the doctrine that thinks the world's salvation\ninevitable.\nMidway between the two there stands what may be called the doctrine of\nmeliorism, tho it has hitherto figured less as a doctrine than as an\nattitude in human affairs. Optimism has always been the regnant DOCTRINE\nin european philosophy. Pessimism was only recently introduced by\nSchopenhauer and counts few systematic defenders as yet. Meliorism\ntreats salvation as neither inevitable nor impossible. It treats it as\na possibility, which becomes more and more of a probability the more\nnumerous the actual conditions of salvation become.\nIt is clear that pragmatism must incline towards meliorism. Some\nconditions of the world's salvation are actually extant, and she cannot\npossibly close her eyes to this fact: and should the residual conditions\ncome, salvation would become an accomplished reality. Naturally the\nterms I use here are exceedingly summary. You may interpret the\nword 'salvation' in any way you like, and make it as diffuse and\ndistributive, or as climacteric and integral a phenomenon as you please.\nTake, for example, any one of us in this room with the ideals which\nhe cherishes, and is willing to live and work for. Every such ideal\nrealized will be one moment in the world's salvation. But these\nparticular ideals are not bare abstract possibilities. They are\ngrounded, they are LIVE possibilities, for we are their live champions\nand pledges, and if the complementary conditions come and add\nthemselves, our ideals will become actual things. What now are the\ncomplementary conditions? They are first such a mixture of things as\nwill in the fulness of time give us a chance, a gap that we can spring\ninto, and, finally, OUR ACT.\nDoes our act then CREATE the world's salvation so far as it makes room\nfor itself, so far as it leaps into the gap? Does it create, not the\nwhole world's salvation of course, but just so much of this as itself\ncovers of the world's extent?\nHere I take the bull by the horns, and in spite of the whole crew of\nrationalists and monists, of whatever brand they be, I ask WHY NOT? Our\nacts, our turning-places, where we seem to ourselves to make ourselves\nand grow, are the parts of the world to which we are closest, the parts\nof which our knowledge is the most intimate and complete. Why should\nwe not take them at their face-value? Why may they not be the actual\nturning-places and growing-places which they seem to be, of the\nworld--why not the workshop of being, where we catch fact in the making,\nso that nowhere may the world grow in any other kind of way than this?\nIrrational! we are told. How can new being come in local spots and\npatches which add themselves or stay away at random, independently of\nthe rest? There must be a reason for our acts, and where in the last\nresort can any reason be looked for save in the material pressure or the\nlogical compulsion of the total nature of the world? There can be but\none real agent of growth, or seeming growth, anywhere, and that agent is\nthe integral world itself. It may grow all-over, if growth there be, but\nthat single parts should grow per se is irrational.\nBut if one talks of rationality and of reasons for things, and insists\nthat they can't just come in spots, what KIND of a reason can there\nultimately be why anything should come at all? Talk of logic and\nnecessity and categories and the absolute and the contents of the whole\nphilosophical machine-shop as you will, the only REAL reason I can think\nof why anything should ever come is that someone wishes it to be here.\nIt is DEMANDED, demanded, it may be, to give relief to no matter\nhow small a fraction of the world's mass. This is living reason, and\ncompared with it material causes and logical necessities are spectral\nthings.\nIn short the only fully rational world would be the world of\nwishing-caps, the world of telepathy, where every desire is fulfilled\ninstanter, without having to consider or placate surrounding or\nintermediate powers. This is the Absolute's own world. He calls upon the\nphenomenal world to be, and it IS, exactly as he calls for it, no other\ncondition being required. In our world, the wishes of the individual are\nonly one condition. Other individuals are there with other wishes\nand they must be propitiated first. So Being grows under all sorts\nof resistances in this world of the many, and, from compromise to\ncompromise, only gets organized gradually into what may be called\nsecondarily rational shape. We approach the wishing-cap type of\norganization only in a few departments of life. We want water and we\nturn a faucet. We want a kodak-picture and we press a button. We want\ninformation and we telephone. We want to travel and we buy a ticket. In\nthese and similar cases, we hardly need to do more than the wishing--the\nworld is rationally organized to do the rest.\nBut this talk of rationality is a parenthesis and a digression. What\nwe were discussing was the idea of a world growing not integrally but\npiecemeal by the contributions of its several parts. Take the hypothesis\nseriously and as a live one. Suppose that the world's author put the\ncase to you before creation, saying: \"I am going to make a world\nnot certain to be saved, a world the perfection of which shall be\nconditional merely, the condition being that each several agent does its\nown 'level best.' I offer you the chance of taking part in such a world.\nIts safety, you see, is unwarranted. It is a real adventure, with real\ndanger, yet it may win through. It is a social scheme of co-operative\nwork genuinely to be done. Will you join the procession? Will you trust\nyourself and trust the other agents enough to face the risk?\"\nShould you in all seriousness, if participation in such a world were\nproposed to you, feel bound to reject it as not safe enough? Would you\nsay that, rather than be part and parcel of so fundamentally pluralistic\nand irrational a universe, you preferred to relapse into the slumber of\nnonentity from which you had been momentarily aroused by the tempter's\nvoice?\nOf course if you are normally constituted, you would do nothing of the\nsort. There is a healthy-minded buoyancy in most of us which such a\nuniverse would exactly fit. We would therefore accept the offer--\"Top!\nund schlag auf schlag!\" It would be just like the world we practically\nlive in; and loyalty to our old nurse Nature would forbid us to say no.\nThe world proposed would seem 'rational' to us in the most living way.\nMost of us, I say, would therefore welcome the proposition and add our\nfiat to the fiat of the creator. Yet perhaps some would not; for there\nare morbid minds in every human collection, and to them the prospect of\na universe with only a fighting chance of safety would probably make no\nappeal. There are moments of discouragement in us all, when we are sick\nof self and tired of vainly striving. Our own life breaks down, and we\nfall into the attitude of the prodigal son. We mistrust the chances\nof things. We want a universe where we can just give up, fall on our\nfather's neck, and be absorbed into the absolute life as a drop of water\nmelts into the river or the sea.\nThe peace and rest, the security desiderated at such moments is security\nagainst the bewildering accidents of so much finite experience. Nirvana\nmeans safety from this everlasting round of adventures of which the\nworld of sense consists. The hindoo and the buddhist, for this\nis essentially their attitude, are simply afraid, afraid of more\nexperience, afraid of life.\nAnd to men of this complexion, religious monism comes with its consoling\nwords: \"All is needed and essential--even you with your sick soul and\nheart. All are one with God, and with God all is well. The everlasting\narms are beneath, whether in the world of finite appearances you seem to\nfail or to succeed.\" There can be no doubt that when men are reduced\nto their last sick extremity absolutism is the only saving scheme.\nPluralistic moralism simply makes their teeth chatter, it refrigerates\nthe very heart within their breast.\nSo we see concretely two types of religion in sharp contrast. Using our\nold terms of comparison, we may say that the absolutistic scheme appeals\nto the tender-minded while the pluralistic scheme appeals to the tough.\nMany persons would refuse to call the pluralistic scheme religious at\nall. They would call it moralistic, and would apply the word religious\nto the monistic scheme alone. Religion in the sense of self-surrender,\nand moralism in the sense of self-sufficingness, have been pitted\nagainst each other as incompatibles frequently enough in the history of\nhuman thought.\nWe stand here before the final question of philosophy. I said in my\nfourth lecture that I believed the monistic-pluralistic alternative to\nbe the deepest and most pregnant question that our minds can frame. Can\nit be that the disjunction is a final one? that only one side can be\ntrue? Are a pluralism and monism genuine incompatibles? So that, if\nthe world were really pluralistically constituted, if it really existed\ndistributively and were made up of a lot of eaches, it could only be\nsaved piecemeal and de facto as the result of their behavior, and its\nepic history in no wise short-circuited by some essential oneness in\nwhich the severalness were already 'taken up' beforehand and eternally\n'overcome'? If this were so, we should have to choose one philosophy or\nthe other. We could not say 'yes, yes' to both alternatives. There would\nhave to be a 'no' in our relations with the possible. We should confess\nan ultimate disappointment: we could not remain healthy-minded and\nsick-minded in one indivisible act.\nOf course as human beings we can be healthy minds on one day and sick\nsouls on the next; and as amateur dabblers in philosophy we may\nperhaps be allowed to call ourselves monistic pluralists, or free-will\ndeterminists, or whatever else may occur to us of a reconciling kind.\nBut as philosophers aiming at clearness and consistency, and feeling the\npragmatistic need of squaring truth with truth, the question is forced\nupon us of frankly adopting either the tender or the robustious type of\nthought. In particular THIS query has always come home to me: May not\nthe claims of tender-mindedness go too far? May not the notion of a\nworld already saved in toto anyhow, be too saccharine to stand? May not\nreligious optimism be too idyllic? Must ALL be saved? Is NO price to be\npaid in the work of salvation? Is the last word sweet? Is all 'yes,\nyes' in the universe? Doesn't the fact of 'no' stand at the very core of\nlife? Doesn't the very 'seriousness' that we attribute to life mean that\nineluctable noes and losses form a part of it, that there are genuine\nsacrifices somewhere, and that something permanently drastic and bitter\nalways remains at the bottom of its cup?\nI can not speak officially as a pragmatist here; all I can say is that\nmy own pragmatism offers no objection to my taking sides with this more\nmoralistic view, and giving up the claim of total reconciliation. The\npossibility of this is involved in the pragmatistic willingness to treat\npluralism as a serious hypothesis. In the end it is our faith and not\nour logic that decides such questions, and I deny the right of any\npretended logic to veto my own faith. I find myself willing to take\nthe universe to be really dangerous and adventurous, without therefore\nbacking out and crying 'no play.' I am willing to think that the\nprodigal-son attitude, open to us as it is in many vicissitudes, is not\nthe right and final attitude towards the whole of life. I am willing\nthat there should be real losses and real losers, and no total\npreservation of all that is. I can believe in the ideal as an ultimate,\nnot as an origin, and as an extract, not the whole. When the cup is\npoured off, the dregs are left behind forever, but the possibility of\nwhat is poured off is sweet enough to accept.\nAs a matter of fact countless human imaginations live in this moralistic\nand epic kind of a universe, and find its disseminated and strung-along\nsuccesses sufficient for their rational needs. There is a finely\ntranslated epigram in the greek anthology which admirably expresses this\nstate of mind, this acceptance of loss as unatoned for, even tho the\nlost element might be one's self:\n\"A shipwrecked sailor, buried on this coast, Bids you set sail. Full\nmany a gallant bark, when we were lost, Weathered the gale.\"\nThose puritans who answered 'yes' to the question: Are you willing to be\ndamned for God's glory? were in this objective and magnanimous condition\nof mind. The way of escape from evil on this system is NOT by getting\nit 'aufgehoben,' or preserved in the whole as an element essential but\n'overcome.' It is by dropping it out altogether, throwing it overboard\nand getting beyond it, helping to make a universe that shall forget its\nvery place and name.\nIt is then perfectly possible to accept sincerely a drastic kind of a\nuniverse from which the element of 'seriousness' is not to be expelled.\nWhoso does so is, it seems to me, a genuine pragmatist. He is willing to\nlive on a scheme of uncertified possibilities which he trusts; willing\nto pay with his own person, if need be, for the realization of the\nideals which he frames.\nWhat now actually ARE the other forces which he trusts to co-operate\nwith him, in a universe of such a type? They are at least his fellow\nmen, in the stage of being which our actual universe has reached. But\nare there not superhuman forces also, such as religious men of the\npluralistic type we have been considering have always believed in? Their\nwords may have sounded monistic when they said \"there is no God but\nGod\"; but the original polytheism of mankind has only imperfectly and\nvaguely sublimated itself into monotheism, and monotheism itself, so far\nas it was religious and not a scheme of class-room instruction for the\nmetaphysicians, has always viewed God as but one helper, primus inter\npares, in the midst of all the shapers of the great world's fate.\nI fear that my previous lectures, confined as they have been to human\nand humanistic aspects, may have left the impression on many of you that\npragmatism means methodically to leave the superhuman out. I have shown\nsmall respect indeed for the Absolute, and I have until this moment\nspoken of no other superhuman hypothesis but that. But I trust that you\nsee sufficiently that the Absolute has nothing but its superhumanness\nin common with the theistic God. On pragmatistic principles, if the\nhypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word,\nit is true. Now whatever its residual difficulties may be, experience\nshows that it certainly does work, and that the problem is to build it\nout and determine it, so that it will combine satisfactorily with all\nthe other working truths. I cannot start upon a whole theology at the\nend of this last lecture; but when I tell you that I have written a book\non men's religious experience, which on the whole has been regarded as\nmaking for the reality of God, you will perhaps exempt my own pragmatism\nfrom the charge of being an atheistic system. I firmly disbelieve,\nmyself, that our human experience is the highest form of experience\nextant in the universe. I believe rather that we stand in much the same\nrelation to the whole of the universe as our canine and feline pets\ndo to the whole of human life. They inhabit our drawing-rooms and\nlibraries. They take part in scenes of whose significance they have no\ninkling. They are merely tangent to curves of history the beginnings and\nends and forms of which pass wholly beyond their ken. So we are tangents\nto the wider life of things. But, just as many of the dog's and cat's\nideals coincide with our ideals, and the dogs and cats have daily living\nproof of the fact, so we may well believe, on the proofs that religious\nexperience affords, that higher powers exist and are at work to save the\nworld on ideal lines similar to our own.\nYou see that pragmatism can be called religious, if you allow that\nreligion can be pluralistic or merely melioristic in type. But whether\nyou will finally put up with that type of religion or not is a question\nthat only you yourself can decide. Pragmatism has to postpone dogmatic\nanswer, for we do not yet know certainly which type of religion is going\nto work best in the long run. The various overbeliefs of men, their\nseveral faith-ventures, are in fact what are needed to bring the\nevidence in. You will probably make your own ventures severally. If\nradically tough, the hurly-burly of the sensible facts of nature will\nbe enough for you, and you will need no religion at all. If radically\ntender, you will take up with the more monistic form of religion:\nthe pluralistic form, with its reliance on possibilities that are not\nnecessities, will not seem to afford you security enough.\nBut if you are neither tough nor tender in an extreme and radical\nsense, but mixed as most of us are, it may seem to you that the type\nof pluralistic and moralistic religion that I have offered is as good a\nreligious synthesis as you are likely to find. Between the two extremes\nof crude naturalism on the one hand and transcendental absolutism on\nthe other, you may find that what I take the liberty of calling the\npragmatistic or melioristic type of theism is exactly what you require.\nThe End", "source": "pragmatism.txt"}
