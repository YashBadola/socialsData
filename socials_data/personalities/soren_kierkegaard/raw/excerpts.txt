From *Either/Or*:

"What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say: 'Sing again soon' - that is, 'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music is delicious.'"

"I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it — you will regret both."

"Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."

From *Fear and Trembling*:

"The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien."

"Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as subordinate to the universal but superior to it, yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute."

From *The Sickness Unto Death*:

"The possible corresponds exactly to the future. For freedom, the possible is the future, and for time, the future is the possible."

"Despair is the sickness unto death."

"The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair."

"To have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him."

From *Journals and Papers*:

"The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die."

"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards."

"People understand me so poorly that they don't even understand my complaint about them not understanding me."

"Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it."

From *Works of Love*:

"To love one's neighbor is to love the whole human race; it is to love all men, even one's enemies, and not to make exceptions, neither of preference nor of aversion."
