This is the origin of our anguish. It is not a question of thinking that I might fall into the precipice or that I might not. I am my own possibility of falling, and I am also my own possibility of not falling. The precipice is there, but it is not a threatening cause; it is a passive danger which I must avoid or into which I may fall. My reaction to it is not determined; I must decide it. And because I am free, I am not the foundation of my freedom. I am condemned to be free. This means that no limits to my freedom can be found except freedom itself or, if you prefer, that we are not free to cease being free. To the extent that the for-itself wishes to hide its own nothingness from itself and to incorporate the in-itself as its true mode of being, it is trying also to hide its freedom from itself. The ultimate meaning of determinism is to establish within us an unbroken continuity of existence in itself. The motive, conceived as a psychic fact, i.e., as a full and given reality, is articulated without any break with the decision and the act, both of which are equally psychic facts. The in-itself has got hold of the for-itself. The for-itself which has become the in-itself is saved. But this determinism, a reflective defense against anguish, is not given as a reflective intuition. It acts as a postulate.
