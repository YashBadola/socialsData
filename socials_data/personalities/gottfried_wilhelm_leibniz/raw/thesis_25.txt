25. We see that nature has given to animals heightened perception, s,
   having provided them with organs which collect numerous rays of light
   or numerous waves of air and thus make them more effective in their
   combination. Something similar to this takes place in the case of
   smell, in that of taste and of touch, and perhaps in many other senses
   which are unknown to us. I shall have occasion very soon to explain how
   that which occurs in the soul represents that which goes on in the
   sense organs.
