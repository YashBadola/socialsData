The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every attempt at meaning, while ambiguity challenges every attempt at absolute meaning.

The man who finds himself cast into the world has no other choice than to make himself be. But he can choose not to choose, he can try to flee his freedom. This is the attitude of the "serious" man. The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the object has a value which is defined by its nature, like the heaviness of a stone.

To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance.

The individual is defined only by his relationship to the world and to other individuals; he exists only by transcending himself, and his freedom can be achieved only through the freedom of others. He justifies his existence by a movement which, like freedom, springs from his heart but which leads outside of him.

Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.
