It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it...
Life is divided into three periods—that which has been, that which is, that which will be. Of these the present time is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain. For the last is the only one over which fortune has lost control, is the only one which cannot be brought back into anyone's power.
Men do not understand how to live; they are always getting ready to live, but never living.
You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.
How late it is to begin really to live just when life must end! How stupid to forget our mortality, and put off sensible plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth years, aiming to begin life at a point to which few have attained!
Can anything be more idiotic than certain people who boast of their foresight? They keep themselves officiously preoccupied in order that they may be able to live better; they spend life in making ready to live!
The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune's control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what is your goal? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.
