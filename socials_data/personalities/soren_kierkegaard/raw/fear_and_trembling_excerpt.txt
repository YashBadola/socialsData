Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age has arranged a regular clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a dirt-cheap price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to go further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and it might be presumed that this would be the place not only for him who has arrived at the frightening anxiety of doubt but also for him who has passed through it—even though he were so forgetful as to have left the result behind him—it might be presumed that this would be the place for them to stop, for them to shudder.

But in our age nobody is willing to stop with faith, but goes further. It would perhaps be rash to ask where they are going, but it is surely a sign of breeding and culture for me to assume that everyone has faith, for otherwise it would be queer for them to go further. In those old days it was different, then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried oldster drew near to his last hour, having fought the good fight and kept the faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten that fear and trembling which chastened the youth, which the man indeed held in check, but which no man quite outgrows . . . except as he might succeed at the earliest opportunity in going further. Where these revered figures arrived, that is the point where everybody in our day begins to go further.

The present writer is nothing of a philosopher, he is, poetice et eleganter [in a poetic and elegant way], a supplementary clerk who neither writes the system nor gives promises of the system, who neither exhausts himself on the system nor binds himself to the system. He writes because to him it is a luxury that becomes the more agreeable and evident, the fewer there are that buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been obliterated in favor of science, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can be easily perused during the afternoon nap, and be sure to carry himself like the polite gardener’s boy in The Advertiser, who with hat in hand and good certificate from the last place he served recommends himself to the esteemed public.
