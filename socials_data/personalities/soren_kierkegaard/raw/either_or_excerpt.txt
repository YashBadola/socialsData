The Rotation Method: An Essay in the Theory of Social Prudence

People with experience maintain that it is very sensible to capture the bird in the hand, but he who wants to capture the bird in the bush must not use his hand but the mousetrap of the imagination.

All men are bored. The word itself suggests the possibility of subdivision. The gods were bored, and so they created man. Adam was bored because he was alone, and so Eve was created. Thus boredom entered the world, and increased in proportion to the increase of population. Adam was bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored together; then Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored en famille; then the population of the world increased, and the peoples were bored en masse. To divert themselves they conceived the idea of constructing a tower high enough to reach the heavens. This idea is itself as boring as the tower was high, and constitutes a terrible proof of how boredom had gained the upper hand.

Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually abbreviated to this: that it is the root of all evil.

The more one limits oneself, the more inventive one becomes. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive, and a spider may furnish him with much entertainment. One realizes his pain, but his ingenuity one does not know.

To be perfectly consistent, the method should be called the Rotation Method. Here, however, I must not be misunderstood. I do not mean a change of field, but a change in the method of cultivation. It is a principle of agriculture that one should not keep on planting the same crop in the same field; and just as one varies the crops, so one varies the soil. But this is not the rotation method. It is the extensive method. The rotation method, properly so called, consists in this, that one changes the method of cultivation and the crops. One does not need to travel around the world to find distraction. One does not need to constantly seek new friends. No, the art is to remember and to forget.

It is essential to have control over one’s moods. One must know how to produce them and how to dismiss them. But the most important thing is to be able to forget. Forgetting is the shears with which you prune away what you cannot use, doing it under the supreme direction of memory. Forgetting and remembering are thus identical arts, and the artistic achievement is the unity of the two.
