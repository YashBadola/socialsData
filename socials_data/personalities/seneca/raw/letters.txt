Letter 1: On Saving Time.
Continue to act thus, my dear Lucilius—set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which in the past has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words,—that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed, you will see that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose. What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.

Therefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity,—time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.

Letter 13: On Groundless Fears.
There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality. I do not speak with you in the Stoic strain but in my milder style. For it is our custom to speak of other things as well as of the wise man's composure; but I, for my part, do not so much as suggest that you should be a wise man. I am myself no wise man; and, what is more, I never shall be. Therefore, require of me, not that I should be equal to the best, but that I should be better than the wicked. It is enough for me if every day I reduce the number of my vices, and blame my mistakes. I have not arrived at perfect health, nor shall I ever arrive at it. I am composing a gouty sort of philosophy. I am content if I can but verify the words of Epicurus: "The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live."
