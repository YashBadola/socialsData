Much learning does not teach one to have understanding, else it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hecataeus.
Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised investigation most of all men, and having chosen out these treatises, he made a wisdom of his own--much learning and bad art.
Hesiod is a teacher of the masses. They suppose him to have possessed the greatest knowledge, who indeed did not know day and night. For they are one.
The Ephesians deserve, man for man, to be hung, and the youth to leave the city, inasmuch as they have banished Hermodorus, the worthiest man among them, saying: "Let no one of us excel, and if there be any such, let him go elsewhere and among other people."
Dogs, also, bark at what they do not know.
A stupid man loves to be puzzled by every discourse.
Homer deserved to be driven out of the lists and flogged, and Archilochus likewise.
For the things which are considered mysteries among men, they celebrate sacrilegiously.
And to these images they pray, as if one should prattle with the houses knowing nothing of gods or heroes, who they are.
When defiled, they purify themselves with blood, just as if any one who had fallen into the mud should wash himself with mud!
For what sense or understanding have they? They follow minstrels and take the multitude for a teacher, not knowing that many are bad and few good.
For the best men choose one thing above all--immortal glory among mortals; but the masses stuff themselves like cattle.
Asses would choose stubble rather than gold.
