1. The most widely accepted notion of God includes the belief that he is an absolutely perfect being. But the consequences of this are not sufficiently considered. And so, to penetrate more deeply into the matter, it is appropriate to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses them all together, and that he possesses each of them in the highest degree.

2. We must also understand what perfection is. One thing is certain: a form or nature that cannot be limited is a perfection. For example, the nature of number implies a limit, because the number 2 is not 3; but the nature of power or of knowledge does not imply a limit. And so, God is powerful and knowing.

3. From this it follows that God, who possesses supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking. And, with respect to ourselves, we can say that the more we are enlightened and informed about the works of God, the more we shall be disposed to find them excellent and entirely in conformity with what we might have desired.

4. Thus, I am far from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no rules of goodness and perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has of them; and who say that the works of God are good only for the formal reason that God has made them. For if that were the case, God, knowing that he is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as the Holy Scripture witnesses. Such an opinion seems to me contrary to the nature of things and to the glory of God.

5. Therefore, one must hold that God acts not only by a will that is simply great and powerful, but by a will that is guided by wisdom and reason. And this is why I say that miracles and the extraordinary concourse of God have their own particular laws, just as does the ordinary course of nature.

6. God has chosen the best possible plan, in producing the universe. For since there is an infinity of possible universes in the ideas of God, and since only one of them can exist, there must be a sufficient reason for the choice of God, which determines him to one rather than to another. And this reason can only be found in the fitness or in the degrees of perfection that these worlds contain, since each possible thing has the right to aspire to existence in proportion to the amount of perfection it contains in reality.

7. Thus the actual existence of the best that wisdom makes known to God is due to this circumstance, that his goodness makes him choose it, and his power makes him produce it.

8. Now this supreme wisdom, united to a goodness that is no less infinite, cannot but have chosen the best. For as a lesser evil is a kind of good, even so a lesser good is a kind of evil if it stands in the way of a greater good; and there would be something to correct in the actions of God if it were possible to do better.

9. It follows from the perfection of God’s works that the whole universe is a perfect unity, such that everything is connected to everything else. For if there were any gap or interruption, there would be a lack of order and of proportion.
