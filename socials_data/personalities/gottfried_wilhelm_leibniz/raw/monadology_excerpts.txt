The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By 'simple' is meant 'without parts.' And there must be simple substances, since there are compounds; for a compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.

Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form [figure] nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word the elements of things. No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means. For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be produced by natural means, since simple substances consist of no parts.

They cannot be formed by composition, and so they can only begin by creation and end by annihilation; whereas that which is compound begins or ends by parts.

There is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in itself or internally changed by any other created thing; since there is nothing to move and no internal structure to be played upon. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidental attributes cannot detach themselves and stroll about outside of substances, as the 'sensible species' of the Schoolmen used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.

However, the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ by their qualities, there would be no means of perceiving any change in things; for what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains.

All natural changes of the Monad come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon its inner being.

God alone is the primary unity or original simple substance, of which all created or derivative Monads are products and have their birth, so to speak, through continual fulgurations of the Divinity from moment to moment, limited by the receptivity of the created being which of its essence is finite.

In God there is Power, which is the source of all, then Knowledge, whose content is the variety of the ideas, and finally Will, which makes changes or products according to the principle of the best. These characteristics are reflected also in the created Monad, the subject of action, the faculty of Perception, and the faculty of Appetition. But in God these attributes are absolutely infinite or perfect; and in the created Monad or the Entelechy (or perfectihabia, as Hermolaus Barbarus translates the word) there are only imitations of these attributes, according to the degree of perfection.

Now this connection or adaptation of all created things to each and of each to all, means that each simple substance has relations which express all the others, and, consequently, that it is a perpetual living mirror of the universe.

And as the same city looked at from different sides appears entirely different, and is as if multiplied perspectively; so also it happens that, as a result of the infinite multitude of simple substances, there are as many different universes as there are Monads, which are, however, but different perspectives of a single universe, according to the special point of view of each Monad.

And this is the way of obtaining as much variety as possible, but with the greatest order possible, that is to say, it is the way of obtaining as much perfection as possible.

Thus the final reason of things must be in a necessary substance, in which the variety of particular changes exists only eminently, as in its source; and this we call God.

Now as in the Ideas of God there is an infinite number of possible universes, and as only one of them can be actual, there must be a sufficient reason for the choice of God, which leads Him to decide upon one rather than another. And this reason can be found only in the fitness, or the degrees of perfection, that these worlds possess, since each possible thing has the right to aspire to existence in proportion to the amount of perfection it contains in germ.

Thus the actual existence of the best that wisdom makes known to God, that his goodness makes him choose, and his power makes him produce.

Every portion of matter may be conceived as like a garden full of plants and like a pond full of fishes. But each branch of every plant, each member of every animal, each drop of its liquid parts is also some such garden or pond. And though the earth and the air which are between the plants of the garden, or the water which is between the fish of the pond, be neither plant nor fish; yet they also contain them, but often so minute as to be imperceptible to us.

Thus there is nothing fallow, nothing sterile, nothing dead in the universe, no chaos, no confusion save in appearance, somewhat as it might appear to be in a pond at a distance, in which one would see a confused movement and, as it were, a swarming of fish in the pond, without separately distinguishing the fish themselves.
