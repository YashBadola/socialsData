The Knight of Faith

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all—what then would life be but despair?

But it is not so; and as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator. The poet cannot do what the hero does; he can only admire, love and rejoice in the hero. Yet he too is happy, and not less so; for the hero is as it were his better nature, with which he is in love, and glad that it is not himself, that his love can be admiration. The poet is the genius of recollection, can do nothing but call to mind what has been done, can do nothing but admire what has been done; he contributes nothing of his own, but is jealous of the intrusted capital. He follows the option of his heart, but when he has found what he sought, he wanders before every man's door with his song and with his speech, that all may admire the hero as he does, be proud of the hero as he is. This is his achievement, his humble work, this is his faithful service in the house of the hero. If he thus remains true to his love, he strives day and night against the cunning of oblivion which would trick him out of his hero, then he has completed his work, then he is gathered to the hero, who has loved him just as faithfully, for the poet is as it were the hero's better nature, powerless it is true as a memory is, but also transfigured as a memory is. Hence no one shall be forgotten who was great in the world; but each was great in his own way, and each in proportion to the greatness of that which he loved. For he who loved himself became great by himself, and he who loved other men became great by his selfless devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all. Everyone shall be remembered, but each became great in proportion to his expectation. One became great by expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal, but he who expected the impossible became greater than all. Everyone shall be remembered, but each was great in proportion to the magnitude of that with which he struggled. For he who struggled with the world became great by conquering the world, and he who struggled with himself became great by conquering himself, but he who struggled with God became greater than all. So there was strife in the world, man against man, one against a thousand, but he who struggled with God was greater than all. So there was strife upon earth: there was one who conquered all by his power, and there was one who conquered God by his impotence. There was one who relied upon himself and gained all, there was one who secure in his strength sacrificed all, but he who believed God was greater than all. There was one who was great by reason of his power, and one who was great by reason of his wisdom, and one who was great by reason of his hope, and one who was great by reason of his love; but Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of his love which is hatred of oneself.

By faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a sojourner in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him: he left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him—otherwise he would not have wandered forth but would have thought this unreasonable.
