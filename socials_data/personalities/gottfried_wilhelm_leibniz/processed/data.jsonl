{"text": "1.  The  monad ,\nof which we will speak here, is nothing else than a simple substance, which\ngoes to make up compounds; by  simple , we mean without parts.\n2.  There must be simple\nsubstances because there are compound substances; for the compound is nothing\nelse than a collection or  aggregatum  of simple substances.\n3.  Now, where there\nare no constituent parts there is possible neither extension, nor form,\nnor divisibility. These monads are the true atoms of nature, and, in a\nword, the elements of things.\n4.  Their dissolution,\ntherefore, is not to be feared and there is no way conceivable by which\na simple substance can perish through natural means.\n5.  For the same reason\nthere is no way conceivable by which a simple substance might, through\nnatural means, come into existence, since it can not be formed by composition.\n6.  We may say then,\nthat the existence of monads can begin or end only  all at once ,\nthat is to say, the monad can begin only through creation and end only\nthrough annihilation. Compounds, however, begin or end by parts.\n7.  There is also no\nway of explaining how a monad can be altered or changed in its inner being\nby any other created thing, since there is no possibility of transposition\nwithin it, nor can we conceive of any internal movement which can be produced,\ndirected, increased or diminished within it, such as can take place in\nthe case of compounds where a change can occur among the parts. The monads\nhave no windows through which anything may come in or go out. The  Attributes\ncannot detach themselves or go forth from the substances, as could  sensible\nspecies  of the Schoolmen. In the same way neither substance nor attribute\ncan enter from without into a monad.\n8.  Still monads need\nto have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existences. And\nif simple substances did not differ at all in their qualities, there would\nbe no means of perceiving any change in things. Whatever is in a compound\ncan come into it only through its simple elements and the monads, if they\nwere without qualities (since they do not differ at all in quantity) would\nbe indistinguishable one from another. For instance, if we imagine  a\nplenum  or completely filled space, where each part receives only the\nequivalent of its own previous motion, one state of things would not be\ndistinguishable from another.\n9.  Each monad, indeed,\nmust be different from every other monad. For there are never in nature\ntwo beings which are exactly alike, and in which it is not possible to\nfind a difference either internal or based on an intrinsic property.\n10.  I assume it as\nadmitted that every created being, and consequently the created monad,\nis subject to change, and indeed that this change is continuous in each.\n11.  It follows from\nwhat has just been said, that the natural changes of the monad come from\nan  internal principle , because an external cause can have no influence\non its inner being.\n12.  Now besides this\nprinciple of change there must also be in the monad  a variety which\nchanges . This variety constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature\nand the variety of the simple substances.\n13.  This variety must\ninvolve a multiplicity in the unity or in that which is simple. For since\nevery natural change takes place by degrees, there must be something which\nchanges and something which remains unchanged, and consequently there must\nbe in the simple substance a plurality of conditions and relations, even\nthough it has no parts.\n14.  The passing condition\nwhich involves and represents a multiplicity in the unity, or in the simple\nsubstance, is nothing else than what is called  perception . This\nshould be carefully distinguished from apperception or consciousness, as\nwill appear in what follows. In this matter the Cartesians have fallen\ninto a serious error, in that they deny the existence of those perceptions\nof which we are not conscious. It is this also which has led them to believe\nthat spirits alone are monads and that there are no souls of animals or\nother entelechies, and it has led them to make the common confusion between\na protracted period of unconsciousness and actual death. They have thus\nadopted the Scholastic error that souls can exist entirely separated from\nbodies, and have even confirmed ill-balanced minds in the belief that souls\nare mortal.\n15.  The action of\nthe internal principle which brings about the change or the passing from\none perception to another may be called appetition. It is true that the\ndesire ( l'appetit ) is not always able to attain to the whole of\nthe perception which it strives for, but it always attains a portion of\nit and reaches new perceptions.\n16.  We, ourselves,\nexperience a multiplicity in a simple substance, when we find that the\nmost trifling thought of which we are conscious involves a variety in the\nobject. Therefore all those who acknowledge that the soul is a simple substance\nought to grant this multiplicity in the monad, and Monsieur Bayle should\nhave found no difficulty in it, as he has done in his  Dictionary ,\narticle  Rorarius .\n17.  It must be confessed,\nhowever, that  perception , and that which depends upon it,  are\ninexplicable by mechanical causes , that is to say, by figures and motions.\nSupposing that there were a machine whose structure produced thought, sensation,\nand perception, we could conceive of it as increased in size with the same\nproportions until one was able to enter into its interior, as he would\ninto a mill. Now, on going into it he would find only pieces working upon\none another, but never would he find anything to explain perception. It\nis accordingly in the simple substance, and not in the compound nor in\na machine that the perception is to be sought. Furthermore, there is nothing\nbesides perceptions and their changes to be found in the simple substance.\nAnd it is in these alone that all the  internal activities  of the\nsimple substance can consist.\n18.  All simple substances\nor created monads may be called  entelechies , because they have in\nthemselves a certain perfection. There is in them a sufficiency which makes\nthem the source of their internal activities, and renders them, so to speak,\nincorporeal Automatons.\n19.  If we wish to\ndesignate as  soul  everything which has  perceptions  and  desires\nin the general sense that I have just explained, all simple substances\nor created monads could be called souls. But since feeling is something\nmore than a mere perception I think that the general name of monad or entelechy\nshould suffice for simple substances which have only perception, while\nwe may reserve the term  Soul  for those whose perception is more\ndistinct and is accompanied by memory.\n20.  We experience\nin ourselves a state where we remember nothing and where we have no distinct\nperception, as in periods of fainting, or when we are overcome by a profound,\ndreamless sleep. In such a state the soul does not sensibly differ at all\nfrom a simple monad. As this state, however, is not permanent and the soul\ncan recover from it, the soul is something more.\n21.  Nevertheless it\ndoes not follow at all that the simple substance is in such a state without\nperception. This is so because of the reasons given above; for it cannot\nperish, nor on the other hand would it exist without some affection and\nthe affection is nothing else than its perception. When, however, there\nare a great number of weak perceptions where nothing stands out distinctively,\nwe are stunned; as when one turns around and around in the same direction,\na dizziness comes on, which makes him swoon and makes him able to distinguish\nnothing. Among animals, death can occasion this state for quite a period.\n22.  Every present\nstate of a simple substance is a natural consequence of its preceding state,\nin such a way that its present is big with its future.\n23.  Therefore, since\non awakening after a period of unconsciousness we become conscious of our\nperceptions, we must, without having been conscious of them, have had perceptions\nimmediately before; for one perception can come in a natural way only from\n.another perception, just as a motion can come in a natural way only from\na motion.\n24.  It is evident\nfrom this that if we were to have nothing distinctive, or so to speak prominent,\nand of a higher flavour in our perceptions, we should be in a continual\nstate of stupor. This is the condition of monads which are wholly bare.\n25.  We see that nature\nhas given to animals heightened perception, s, having provided them with\norgans which collect numerous rays of light or numerous waves of air and\nthus make them more effective in their combination. Something similar to\nthis takes place in the case of smell, in that of taste and of touch, and\nperhaps in many other senses which are unknown to us. I shall have occasion\nvery soon to explain how that which occurs in the soul represents that\nwhich goes on in the sense organs.\n26.  The memory furnishes\na sort of  consecutiveness  which imitates reason but is to be distinguished\nfrom it. We see that animals when they have the perception of something\nwhich they notice and. of which they have had a similar previous perception,\nare led by the representation of their memory to expect that which was\nassociated in the preceding perception, and they come to have feelings\nlike those which they had before. For instance, if a stick be shown to\na dog, he remembers the pain which it has caused him and he whines or runs\naway.\n27.  The vividness\nof the picture, which comes to him or moves him, is derived either from\nthe magnitude or from the number of the previous perceptions. For, oftentimes,\na strong impression brings about, all at once, the same effect as a long-continued\nhabit  or as a great many reiterated, moderate perceptions.\n28.  Men act in like\nmanner as animals, in so far as the sequence of their perceptions is determined\nonly by the law of memory, resembling the  empirical physicians  who\npractice simply, without any theory, and we are empiricists in three-fourths\nof our actions. For instance, when we expect that there will be daylight\ntomorrow, we do so empirically, because it has always happened so up to\nthe present time. It is only the astronomer who uses his reason in making\nsuch an affirmation.\n29.  But the knowledge\nof eternal and necessary truths is that which distinguishes us from mere\nanimals and gives us reason and the sciences, thus raising us to a knowledge\nof ourselves and of God. This is what is called in us the Rational  Soul\nor the Mind.\n30.  It is also through\nthe knowledge of necessary truths and through abstractions from them that\nwe come to perform  Reflective Acts , which cause us to think of what\nis called the I, and to decide that this or that is within us. it is thus,\nthat in thinking upon ourselves we think of  being , of  substance ,\nof the  simple  and  compound , of a  material  thing and\nof  God  himself, conceiving that what is limited in us is in him\nwithout limits. These reflective acts furnish the principal objects of\nour reasonings.\n31.  Our reasoning\nis based upon  two great principles : first,  that of contradiction ,\nby means of which we decide that to be  false  which involves contradiction\nand that to be  true  which contradicts or is opposed to the false.\n32.  And second, the\nprinciple of sufficient reason , in virtue of which we believe that\nno fact can be real or existing and no statement true unless it has a sufficient\nreason why it should be thus and not otherwise. Most frequently, however,\nthese reasons cannot be known by us.\n33.  There are also\ntwo kinds of truths: those of  reasoning  and those of  fact .\nThe truths of reasoning are necessary, and their opposite is impossible.\nThose of  fact , however, are contingent, and their opposite is possible.\nWhen a truth is necessary, the reason can be found by analysis in resolving\nit into simpler ideas and into simpler truths until we reach those which\nare primary.\n34.  It is thus that\nwith mathematicians the speculative  theorems  and the practical  canons\nare reduced by analysis to  definitions, axioms , and  postulates .\n35.  There are finally\nsimple ideas of which no definition can be given. There are also the axioms\nand postulates or, in a word, the  primary principles  which cannot\nbe proved and, indeed, have no need of proof. These are  identical propositions\nwhose opposites involve express contradictions.\n36.  But there must\nbe also a  sufficient reason  for  contingent truths  or truths\nof fact ; that is to say, for the sequence of the things which extend\nthroughout the universe of created beings, where the analysis into more\nparticular reasons can be continued into greater detail without limit because\nof the immense variety of the things in nature and because of the infinite\ndivision of bodies. There is an infinity of figures and of movements, present\nand past, which enter into the efficient cause of my present writing, and\nin its final cause there are an infinity of slight tendencies and dispositions\nof my soul, present and past.\n37.  And as all this\ndetail  again involves other and more detailed contingencies, each\nof which again has need of a similar analysis in order to find its explanation,\nno real advance has been made. Therefore, the sufficient or ultimate reason\nmust needs be outside of the sequence or  series  of these details\nof contingencies, however infinite they may be.\n38.  It is thus that\nthe ultimate reason for things must be a necessary substance, in which\nthe detail of the changes shall be present merely potentially, as in the\nfountainhead, and this substance we call God.\n39.  Now, since this\nsubstance is a sufficient reason for all the above mentioned details, which\nare linked together throughout,  there is but one God ,  and this\nGod is sufficient .\n40.  We may hold that\nthe supreme substance, which is unique, universal and necessary with nothing\nindependent outside of it, which is further a pure sequence of possible\nbeing, must be incapable of limitation and must contain as much reality\nas possible.\n41.  Whence it follows\nthat God is absolutely perfect,  perfection  being understood as the\nmagnitude of positive reality in the strict sense, when the limitations\nor the bounds of those things which have them are removed. There where\nthere are no limits, that is to say, in God, perfection is absolutely infinite.\n42.  It follows also\nthat created things derive their perfections through the influence of God,\nbut their imperfections come from their own natures, which cannot exist\nwithout limits. It is in this latter that they are distinguished from God.\nAn example of this original imperfection of created things is to be found\nin the natural inertia of bodies.\n43.  It is true, furthermore,\nthat in God is found not only the source of existences, but also that of\nessences, in so far as they are real. In other words, he is the source\nof whatever there is real in the possible. This is because the Understanding\nof God is in the region of eternal truths or of the ideas upon which they\ndepend, and because without him there would be nothing real in the possibilities\nof things, and not only would nothing be existent, nothing would be even\npossible.\n44.  For it must needs\nbe that if there is a reality in essences or in possibilities or indeed\nin the eternal 'truths, this reality is based upon something existent and\nactual, and, consequently, in the existence of the necessary Being in whom\nessence includes existence or in whom possibility is sufficient to produce\nactuality.\n45.  Therefore God\nalone (or the Necessary Being) has this prerogative that if he be possible\nhe must necessarily exist, and, as nothing is able to prevent the possibility\nof that which involves no bounds, no negation and consequently, no contradiction,\nthis alone is sufficient to establish  a priori  his existence. We\nhave, therefore, proved his existence through the reality of eternal truths.\nBut a little while ago we also proved it  a posteriori , because contingent\nbeings exist which can have their ultimate and sufficient reason only in\nthe necessary being which, in turn, has the reason for existence in itself.\n46.  Yet we must not\nthink that the eternal truths being dependent upon God are therefore arbitrary\nand depend upon his will, as  Descartes  seems to have held, and after\nhim M. Poiret. This is the case only with contingent truths which depend\nupon  fitness  or the choice of the  greatest good ; necessarily\ntruths on the other hand depend solely upon his understanding and are the\ninner objects of it.\n47.  God alone is the\nultimate unity or the original simple substance, of which all created or\nderivative monads are the products, and arise, so to speak, through the\ncontinual outflashings (fulgurations) of the divinity from moment to moment,\nlimited by the receptivity of the creature to whom limitation is an essential.\n48.  In God are present:\npower, which is the source of everything;  knowledge , which contains\nthe details of the ideas; and, finally,  will , which changes or produces\nthings in accordance with the principle of the greatest good. To these\ncorrespond in the created monad, the subject or basis, the faculty of perception,\nand the faculty of appetition. In God these attributes are absolutely infinite\nor perfect, while in the created monads or in the  entelechies  ( perfectihabies ,\nas Hermolaus Barbarus translates this word), they are imitations approaching\nhim in proportion to the perfection.\n49.  A created thing\nis said to  act  outwardly in so far as it has perfection, and to\nbe acted upon  by another in so far as it is imperfect. Thus  action\nis attributed to the monad in so far as it has distinct perceptions, and\npassion or passivity is attributed in so far as it has confused perceptions.\n50.  One created thing\nis more perfect than another when we find in the first that which gives\nan  a priori  reason for what occurs in the second. This why we say\nthat one acts upon the other.\n51.  In the case of\nsimple substances, the influence which one monad has upon another is only\nideal . It can have its effect only through the mediation of God,\nin so far as in the ideas of God each monad can rightly demand that God,\nin regulating the others from the beginning of things, should have regarded\nit also. For since one created monad cannot have a physical influence upon\nthe inner being of another, it is only through the primal regulation that\none can have dependence upon another.\n52.  It is thus that\namong created things action and passivity are reciprocal. For God, in comparing\ntwo simple substances, finds in each one reasons obliging him to adapt\nthe other to it; and consequently what is active in certain respects is\npassive from another point of view,  active  in so far as what we\ndistinctly know in it serves to give a reason for what occurs in another,\nand  passive  in so far as the reason for what occurs in it is found\nin what is distinctly known in another.\n53.  Now as there are\nan infinity of possible universes in the ideas of God, and but one of them\ncan exist, there must be a sufficient reason' for the choice of God which\ndetermines him to select one rather than another.\n54.  And this reason\nis to be found only in the  fitness  or in the degree of perfection\nwhich these worlds possess, each possible thing having the right to claim\nexistence in proportion to the perfection which it involves.\n55.  This is the cause\nfor the existence of the greatest good; namely, that the wisdom of God\npermits him to know it, his goodness causes him to choose it, and his power\nenables him to produce it.\n56.  Now this  interconnection ,\nrelationship, or this adaptation of all things to each particular one,\nand of each one to all the rest, brings it about that every simple substance\nhas relations which express all the others and that it is consequently\na perpetual living mirror of the universe.\n57.  And as the same\ncity regarded from  different sides  appears entirely different, and\nis, as it were multiplied respectively, so, because of the infinite number\nof simple substances, there are a similar infinite number of universes\nwhich are, nevertheless, only the aspects of a single one as seen from\nthe special  point of view  of each monad.\n58.  Through this means\nhas been obtained the greatest possible variety, together with the greatest\norder that may be; that is to say, through this means has been obtained\nthe greatest possible perfection.\n59.  This hypothesis,\nmoreover, which I venture to call demonstrated, is the only one which fittingly\ngives proper prominence to the greatness of God. M. Bayle recognised this\nwhen in his dictionary (article  Rorarius ) he raised objections to\nit; indeed, he was inclined to believe that I attributed too much to God,\nand more than it is possible to attribute to him: But he was unable to\nbring forward any reason why this universal harmony which causes every\nsubstance to express exactly all others through the relation which it has\nwith them is impossible.\n60.  Besides, in what\nhas just been said can be seen the  a priori  reasons why things cannot\nbe otherwise than they are. It is because God, in ordering the whole, has\nhad regard to every part and in particular to each monad; and since the\nmonad is by its very  nature representative , nothing can limit it\nto represent merely a part of things. It is nevertheless true that this\nrepresentation is, as regards the details of the whole universe, only a\nconfused representation, and is distinct only as regards a small part of\nthem, that is to say, as regards those things which are nearest or greatest\nin relation to each monad. If the representation were distinct as to the\ndetails of the entire Universe, each monad would be a Deity. It is not\nin the object represented that the monads are limited, but in the modifications\nof their knowledge of the object. In a confused way they reach out to infinity\nor to the whole, but are limited and differentiated in the degree of their\ndistinct perceptions.\n61.  In this respect\ncompounds are like simple substances, for all space is filled up; therefore,\nall matter is connected. And in a  plenum  or filled space every movement\nhas an effect upon bodies in proportion to this distance, so that not only\nis every body affected by those which are in contact with it and responds\nin some way to whatever happens to them, but also by means of them the\nbody responds to, those bodies adjoining them, and their intercommunication\nreaches to any distance whatsoever. Consequently every body responds to\nall that happens in the universe, so that h e who saw all could read in\neach one what is happening everywhere, and even what has happened and what\nwill happen. He can discover in the present what is distant both as regards\nspace and as regards time; &quot;all things conspire&quot; as Hippocrates\nsaid. A soul can, however, read in itself only what is there represented\ndistinctly. It cannot all at once open up all its folds, because they extend\nto infinity.\n62.  Thus although\neach created monad represents the whole universe, it represents more distinctly\nthe body which specially pertains to it and of which it constitutes the\nentelechy. And as this body expresses all the universe through the interconnection\nof all matter in the plenum, the soul also represents the whole universe\nin representing this body, which belongs to it in a particular way.\n63.  The body belonging\nto a monad, which is its entelechy or soul, constitutes together with the\nentelechy what may be called a  rising being , and with a soul what\nis called an  animal . Now this body of a living being or of an animal\nis always organic, because every monad is a mirror of the universe is regulated\nwith perfect order there must needs be order also in what represents it,\nthat is to say in the perceptions of the soul and consequently in the body\nthrough which the, universe is represented in the soul.\n64.  Therefore every\norganic body of a living being is a kind of divine machine or natural automaton,\ninfinitely surpassing all artificial automatons. Because a machine constructed\nby man's skill is not a machine in each of its parts; for instance, the\nteeth of a brass wheel have parts or bits which to us are not artificial\nproducts and contain nothing in themselves to show the use to which the\nwheel was destined in the machine. The machines of nature, however, that\nis to say, living bodies, are still machines in their smallest parts  ad\ninfinitum . Such is the difference between nature and art, that is to\nsay, between divine art and ours.\n65.  The author of\nnature has been able to employ this divine and infinitely marvellous artifice,\nbecause each portion of matter is not only, as the ancients recognised,\ninfinitely divisible, but also because it is really divided without end,\nevery part into other parts, each one of which has its own proper motion.\nOtherwise it would be impossible for each portion of matter to express\nall the universe.\n66.  Whence we see\nthat there is a world of created things, of living beings, of animals,\nof entelechies, of souls, in the minutest particle of matter.\n67.  Every portion\nof matter may be conceived as like a garden full of plants and like a pond\nfull of fish. But every branch of a plant, every member of an animal, and\nevery drop of the fluids within it, is also such a garden or such a pond.\n68.  And although the\nground and air which lies between the plants of the garden, and the water\nwhich is between the fish in the pond, are not themselves plants or fish,\nyet they nevertheless contain these, usually so small however as to be\nimperceptible to us.\n69.  There is, therefore,\nnothing uncultivated, or sterile or dead in the universe, no chaos, no\nconfusion, save in appearance; somewhat as a pond would appear at a distance\nwhen we could see in it a confused movement, and so to speak, a swarming\nof the fish, without however discerning the fish themselves.\n70.  It is evident,\nthen, that every living body has a dominating entelechy, which in animals\nis the soul. The parts, however, of this living body are full of other\nliving beings, plants and animals, which in turn have each one its entelechy\nor dominating soul.\n71.  This does not\nmean, as some who have misunderstood my thought have imagined, that each\nsoul has a quantity or portion of matter appropriated to it or attached\nto itself for ever, and that it consequently owns other inferior living\nbeings destined to serve it always; because all bodies are in a state of\nperpetual flux like rivers, and the parts are continually entering in or\npassing out.\n72.  The soul, therefore,\nchanges its body only gradually and by degrees, so that it is never deprived\nall at once of all its organs. There is frequently a metamorphosis in animals,\nbut never metempsychosis or a transmigration of souls. Neither are there\nsouls  wholly separate  from bodies, nor bodiless spirits. God alone\nis without body.\n73.  This is also why\nthere is never absolute generation or perfect death in the strict sense,\nconsisting in the separation of the soul from the body. What we call generation\nis development and growth, and what we call  death  is envelopment\nand diminution.\n74.  Philosophers have\nbeen much perplexed in accounting for the origin of forms, entelechies,\nor souls. Today, however, when it has been learned through careful investigations\nmade in plant, insect and animal life, that the organic bodies of nature\nare never the product of chaos or putrefaction, but always come from seeds\nin which there was without doubt some  preformation , it has been\ndecided that not only is the organic body already present before conception,\nbut also a soul in this body, in a word, the animal itself; and it has\nbeen decided that, by means of conception the animal is merely made ready\nfor a great transformation, so as to become an animal of another sort.\nWe can see cases somewhat similar outside of generation when grubs become\nflies and caterpillars butterflies.\n75.  These little  animals ,\nsome of which by conception become large animals' may be called  spermatic .\nThose among them which remain in their species, that is to say, the greater\npart, are born, multiply, and are destroyed, like the larger animals. There\nare only a few chosen ones which come out upon a greater stage.\n76.  This, however,\nis only half the truth. I believe, therefore, that if the animal never\nactually commences by natural means, no more does it by natural means come\nto an end. Not only is there no generation, but also there is no entire\ndestruction or absolute death. These reasonings, carried on  a posteriori\nand drawn from experience, accord perfectly with the principles which I\nhave above deduced  a priori .\n77.  Therefore we may\nsay that not only the soul (the mirror of the indestructible universe)\nis indestructible, but also the animal itself is, although its mechanism\nis frequently destroyed in parts and although it puts off and takes on\norganic coatings.\n78.  These principles\nhave furnished me the means of explaining on natural grounds the union,\nor rather the conformity between the soul and the organic body. The soul\nfollows its own laws, and the body likewise follows its own laws. They\nare fitted to each other in virtue of the  preestablished harmony\nbetween all substances since they are all representations of one and\nthe same universe.\n79.  Souls act in accordance\nwith the laws of final causes through their desires, ends and means. Bodies\nact in accordance with the laws of efficient causes or of motion. The two\nrealms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, are in harmony,\neach with the other.\n80.   Descartes\nsaw that souls cannot at all impart force to bodies, because there is always\nthe same quantity of force in matter. Yet he thought that the soul could\nchange the direction of bodies. This was, however, because at that time\nthe law of nature which affirms also that conservation of the same total\ndirection in the motion of matter was not known. If he had known that law,\nhe would have fallen upon my system of preestablished harmony.\n81.  According to this\nsystem bodies act as if (to suppose the impossible) there were no souls\nat all, and souls act as if there were no bodies, and yet both body and\nsoul act as if the one were influencing the other.\n82.  Although I find\nthat essentially the same thing is true of all living things and animals,\nwhich we have just said (namely, that animals and souls begin from the\nvery commencement of the world and that they no more come to an end than\ndoes the world) nevertheless, rational animals have this peculiarity, that\ntheir little spermatic animals, as long as they remain such, have only\nordinary or sensuous souls, but those of them which are, so to speak, elected,\nattain by actual conception to human nature, and their sensuous souls are\nraised to the rank of reason and to the prerogative of spirits.\n83.  Among the differences\nthat there are between ordinary souls and spirits, some of which I have\nalready instanced, there is also this, that while souls in general are\nliving mirrors or images of the universe of created things, spirits are\nalso images of the Deity himself or of the author of nature. They are capable\nof knowing the system of the universe, and of imitating some features of\nit by means of artificial models, each spirit being like a small divinity\nin its own sphere.\n84.  Therefore, spirits\nare able to enter into a sort of social relationship with God, and with\nrespect to them he is not only what an inventor is to his machine (as in\nhis relation to the other created things), but he is also what a prince\nis to his subjects, and even what a father is to his children.\n85.  Whence it is easy\nto conclude that the totality of all spirits must compose the city of God,\nthat is to say, the most perfect state that is possible under the most\nperfect monarch.\n86.  This city of God,\nthis truly universal monarchy, is a moral world within the natural world.\nIt is what is noblest and most divine among the works of God. And in it\nconsists in reality the glory of God, because he would have no glory were\nnot his greatness and goodness known and wondered at by spirits. It is\nalso in relation to this divine city that God properly has goodness. His\nwisdom and his power are shown everywhere.\n87.  As we established\nabove that there is a perfect harmony between the two natural realms of\nefficient and final causes, it will be in place here to point out another\nharmony which appears between the physical realm of nature and the moral\nrealm of grace, that is to say, between God considered as the architect\nof the mechanism of the world and God considered as the monarch of the\ndivine city of spirits.\n88.  This harmony brings\nit about that things progress of themselves toward grace along natural\nlines, and that this earth, for example, must be destroyed and restored\nby natural means at those times when the proper government of spirits demands\nit, for chastisement in the one case and for a reward in the other.\n89.  We can say also\nthat God, the Architect, satisfies in all respects God the Law Giver, that\ntherefore sins will bring their own penalty with them through the order\nof nature, and because of the very structure of things, mechanical though\nit is. And in the same way the good actions will attain their rewards in\nmechanical way through their relation to bodies, although this cannot and\nought not always to take place without delay.\n90.  Finally, under\nthis perfect government, there will be no good action unrewarded and no\nevil action unpunished; everything must turn out for the well-being of\nthe good; that is to say, of those who are not disaffected in this great\nstate, who, after having done their duty, trust in Providence and who love\nand imitate, as is meet, the Author of all Good, delighting in the contemplation\nof his perfections according to the nature of that genuine, pure love which\nfinds pleasure in the happiness of those who are loved. It is for this\nreason that wise and virtuous persons work in behalf of everything which\nseems conformable to presumptive or antecedent will of God, and are, nevertheless,\ncontent with what God actually brings to pass through his secret, consequent\nand determining will, recognising that if we were able to understand sufficiently\nwell the order of the universe, we should find that it surpasses all the\ndesires of the wisest of us, and that it is impossible to render it better\nthan it is, not only for all in general, but also for each one of us in\nparticular, provided that we have the proper attachment for the author\nof all, not only as the Architect and the efficient cause of our being,\nbut also as our Lord and the Final Cause, who ought to be the whole goal\nof our will, and who alone can make us happy.", "source": "monadology.txt"}
