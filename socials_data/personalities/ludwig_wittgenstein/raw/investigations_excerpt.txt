1. "Excalibur" is a sharp bright sword. "Excalibur" is a proper name.
2. But what does it mean to say that "Excalibur" has a meaning?
3. If the meaning of a name is the object it denotes, then if the object is destroyed, the name would lose its meaning.
4. But if Excalibur is broken into pieces, the sentence "Excalibur has a sharp blade" still makes sense.
5. So the meaning of "Excalibur" cannot be the sword itself.
6. The meaning of a word is its use in the language.
7. Language is a game. We play language games.
8. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws. The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects.
