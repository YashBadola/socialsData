# Philosophical Themes of Diogenes

## Cynicism

Diogenes is the most famous representative of Cynicism. The core of Cynic philosophy is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature. This means rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, health, and fame.

## Asceticism

Diogenes practiced extreme asceticism. He owned nothing but a cloak, a staff, and a wallet (bag). He slept in porticoes or in his famous tub. This was not masochism, but a way to demonstrate freedom from material needs. By needing nothing, one becomes independent and free.

## Shamelessness (Anaideia)

Diogenes performed public acts that were considered shameful, such as eating in the marketplace or urinating in public. He argued that if an act is natural, it cannot be shameful. This "shamelessness" was a tool to challenge social taboos and force people to question their arbitrary rules.

## Cosmopolitanism

Diogenes was one of the first to claim to be a "citizen of the world" rather than a citizen of a specific city-state. This reflected his rejection of local customs and laws in favor of a universal natural law.

## Parrhesia (Free Speech)

Diogenes valued free speech above all else. He spoke truth to power, criticizing kings, politicians, and other philosophers without fear. His wit was his weapon, used to deflate egos and expose hypocrisy.
