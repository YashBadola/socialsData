PART I: AMBIGUITY AND FREEDOM

The continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. "That is to say," interprets Heidegger, "man is a being for death." And it is true that it is by the presence of death that life is first defined: the plant lives, the animal lives, because they can die. But it is a different matter for man, for if he is "a being for death," he is also a being who knows that he is a being for death.

The "serious" man is the one who agrees to the given world and claims to find in it the justification for his existence. He is a tyrant. He denies the freedom of others to ensure his own safety. He is the one who claims to be the "realist" when he is only a resignation.

But if man is free to define himself, he does not find this freedom ready-made; he must win it. The child is in a serious world, a world of ready-made values. It is only in adolescence that he discovers his freedom and the burden that it entails.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person the concrete action he must take. We have to create our own essence, it is true; but this creation is not a solitary act. My freedom depends on the freedom of others.

The ambiguity of the human condition is that we are both subject and object, sovereign and crushed, free and bound. We must assume this ambiguity. We must not try to flee it into the "seriousness" of dogmatic values or the nihilism of despair. We must act. We must choose. And in choosing for ourselves, we choose for all men.
