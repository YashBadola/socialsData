{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the commercial world, but also in the world of ideas, our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without regard for the individual's welfare to assume that they have doubted everything, for otherwise it would be a curious statement for them to make that they are proceeding further. This movement they have made, then, or are making\u2014would that it were possible to see it! But one does not see it, even though they are able to say that they are doing it. They are all proceeding further, and yet they are all remaining in the same place\u2014doubting everything.\n...\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
