{"text": "The way up and the way down are one and the same.\nNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was, is, and will be: an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nEverything flows and nothing stands still.\nMen do not understand how that which is torn in different directions comes into accord with itself - harmony in contrariety, as in the case of the bow and the lyre.\nListening not to me but to the Logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.\nThe waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.\nNature loves to hide.\nEyes and ears are poor witnesses for men if they have barbarian souls.\nImmortals are mortals, mortals immortals, living their death, dying their life.\nTime is a game played beautifully by children.\nIf you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.\nMan is kindled and put out like a light in the night.\nDogs bark at what they do not know.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
