The Sickness Unto Death is despair.

I. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

A. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and So It May Have a Threefold Form: in Despair at Not Being Conscious of Having a Self (Despair Improperly So Called); in Despair at Not Willing to Be Oneself; in Despair at Willing to Be Oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Such a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.
If the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the entire relation.

The human self is such a derived, established relation, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If a human self had itself established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.

The Possibility of this Sickness is Man’s Advantage Over the Beast

And this advantage is infinite. The possibility of this sickness is man’s superiority over the animal; for this sickness indicates infinite erectness. The possibility of this sickness is man’s eternal nature.

To be without this sickness is the greatest misfortune, it is waste and perdition; to have it is the greatest good. But to have it in truth is not to have it in the way one has a cold or the fever, but to have it in the way one has an eternal life.
