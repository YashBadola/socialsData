I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, one sees ladies in long dresses and ostrich feather hats, and gentlemen wearing boaters and panamas, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Mama holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a pleated skirt and a tam-o'-shanter; I am two and a half, and my sister has just been born. I was evidently jealous, but not for long. As far back as I can remember, I was always proud of being the elder: the first. Disguised as Little Red Riding Hood, carrying a basket of cakes and a pot of butter, I felt myself much more interesting than an infant swaddled in her cradle. I had a little sister: that baby doll was mine.

My sister was Poupette; I was the elder. I accepted that hierarchy. But I was not just the elder; I was the one who knew things. I knew how to read, I knew the history of France and the story of the Holy Family. I was learning the piano. Poupette was the little one who knew nothing. I loved her, but with a protective love; I was the sovereign subject, she was the object to be protected and guided.

We lived in a world where everything was clear. There was Good and there was Evil. God was good, and my parents were his representatives on earth. To disobey them was to disobey God. I was a dutiful daughter. I accepted their laws. But early on, I felt the need to make my own mark on the world. I would write. I would tell stories. I would not be like the other women I saw around me, confined to their drawing rooms and their domestic duties. I wanted to travel, to know everything, to be everything.

The world of my childhood was a protected one, but as I grew older, I began to see the cracks. I saw the poverty in the streets, I heard whispers of war. And within my own family, I sensed a certain tension. My father, a man of culture and wit, had lost his fortune. We were "nouveau pauvre," struggling to keep up appearances. This change in our circumstances had a profound effect on me. It meant that I would have to work for a living. I would not have a dowry; I would not be married off to a wealthy husband. At first, this realization frightened me, but then it liberated me. If I had to work, I could be independent. I could choose my own path. I could be a teacher, a writer. I could live my own life.

I remember sitting in the family library, surrounded by books. They were my refuge and my inspiration. I read everything I could get my hands on: novels, history, philosophy. I began to question the values I had been taught. Why were women treated differently from men? Why was it considered "unfeminine" to be intellectual? Why was marriage the only goal for a girl? These questions burned in my mind, and they would eventually lead me to write "The Second Sex." But for now, I was just a girl with a passion for learning and a fierce desire to be free.
