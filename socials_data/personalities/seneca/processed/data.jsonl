THE LAST THAT WAS EVER HEARD OF HARRY BOLTON\nCHAPTER I.\nHOW WELLINGBOROUGH REDBURN\u2019S TASTE FOR THE SEA WAS BORN AND BRED IN HIM\n\u201cWellingborough, as you are going to sea, suppose you take this\nshooting-jacket of mine along; it\u2019s just the thing\u2014take it, it will\n_save_ the expense of another. You see, it\u2019s quite warm; fine long\nskirts, stout horn buttons, and plenty of pockets.\u201d\nOut of the goodness and simplicity of his heart, thus spoke my elder\nbrother to me, upon the _eve_ of my departure for the seaport.\n\u201cAnd, Wellingborough,\u201d he added, \u201csince we are both short of money, and\nyou want an outfit, and I _Have_ none to _give,_ you may as well take\nmy fowling-piece along, and sell it in New York for what you can\nget.\u2014Nay, take it; it\u2019s of no use to me now; I can\u2019t find it in powder\nany more.\u201d\nI was then but a boy. Some time previous my mother had removed from New\nYork to a pleasant village on the Hudson River, where we lived in a\nsmall house, in a quiet way. Sad disappointments in several plans which\nI had sketched for my future life; the necessity of doing something for\nmyself, united to a naturally roving disposition, had now conspired\nwithin me, to send me to sea as a sailor.\nFor months previous I had been poring over old New York papers,\ndelightedly perusing the long columns of ship advertisements, all of\nwhich possessed a strange, romantic charm to me. Over and over again I\ndevoured such announcements as the following:\nFOR BREMEN.\n_The coppered and copper-fastened brig Leda, having nearly completed\nher cargo, will sail for the above port on Tuesday the twentieth of\nMay.\nFor freight or passage apply on board at Coenties Slip.\n_\nTo my young inland imagination every word in an advertisement like\nthis, suggested volumes of thought.\nA _brig!_ The very word summoned up the idea of a black, sea-worn\ncraft, with high, cozy bulwarks, and rakish masts and yards.\n_Coppered and copper-fastened!_ That fairly smelt of the salt water!\nHow different such vessels must be from the wooden, one-masted,\ngreen-and-white-painted sloops, that glided up and down the river\nbefore our house on the bank.\n_Nearly completed her cargo!_ How momentous the announcement;\nsuggesting ideas, too, of musty bales, and cases of silks and satins,\nand filling me with contempt for the vile deck-loads of hay and lumber,\nwith which my river experience was familiar.\n_Will sail on Tuesday the 20th of May-and_ the newspaper bore date the\nfifth of the month! Fifteen whole days beforehand; think of that; what\nan important voyage it must be, that the time of sailing was fixed upon\nso long beforehand; the river sloops were not used to make such\nprospective announcements.\n_For freight or passage apply on board!_ Think of going on board a\ncoppered and copper-fastened brig, and taking passage for Bremen! And\nwho could be going to Bremen? No one but foreigners, doubtless; men of\ndark complexions and jet-black whiskers, who talked French.\n_Coenties Slip._ Plenty more brigs and any quantity of ships must be\nlying there. Coenties Slip must be somewhere near ranges of\ngrim-looking warehouses, with rusty iron doors and shutters, and tiled\nroofs; and old anchors and chain-cable piled on the walk. Old-fashioned\ncoffeehouses, also, much abound in that neighborhood, with sunburnt\nsea-captains going in and out, smoking cigars, and talking about\nHavanna, London, and Calcutta.\nAll these my imaginations were wonderfully assisted by certain shadowy\nreminiscences of wharves, and warehouses, and shipping, with which a\nresidence in a seaport during early childhood had supplied me.\nParticularly, I remembered standing with my father on the wharf when a\nlarge ship was getting under way, and rounding the head of the pier. I\nremembered the _yo heave ho!_ of the sailors, as they just showed their\nwoolen caps above the high bulwarks. I remembered how I thought of\ntheir crossing the great ocean; and that that very ship, and those very\nsailors, so near to me then, would after a time be actually in Europe.\nAdded to these reminiscences my father, now dead, had several times\ncrossed the Atlantic on business affairs, for he had been an importer\nin Broad-street. And of winter evenings in New York, by the\nwell-remembered sea-coal fire in old Greenwich-street, he used to tell\nmy brother and me of the monstrous waves at sea, mountain high; of the\nmasts bending like twigs; and all about Havre, and Liverpool, and about\ngoing up into the ball of St. Paul\u2019s in London. Indeed, during my early\nlife, most of my thoughts of the sea were connected with the land; but\nwith fine old lands, full of mossy cathedrals and churches, and long,\nnarrow, crooked streets without sidewalks, and lined with strange\nhouses. And especially I tried hard to think how such places must look\nof rainy days and Saturday afternoons; and whether indeed they did have\nrainy days and Saturdays there, just as we did here; and whether the\nboys went to school there, and studied geography, and wore their shirt\ncollars turned over, and tied with a black ribbon; and whether their\npapas allowed them to wear boots, instead of shoes, which I so much\ndisliked, for boots looked so manly.\nAs I grew older my thoughts took a larger flight, and I frequently fell\ninto long reveries about distant voyages and travels, and thought how\nfine it would be, to be able to talk about remote and barbarous\ncountries; with what reverence and wonder people would regard me, if I\nhad just returned from the coast of Africa or New Zealand; how dark and\nromantic my sunburnt cheeks would look; how I would bring home with me\nforeign clothes of a rich fabric and princely make, and wear them up\nand down the streets, and how grocers\u2019 boys would turn back their heads\nto look at me, as I went by. For I very well remembered staring at a\nman myself, who was pointed out to me by my aunt one Sunday in Church,\nas the person who had been in Stony Arabia, and passed through strange\nadventures there, all of which with my own eyes I had read in the book\nwhich he wrote, an arid-looking book in a pale yellow cover.\n\u201cSee what big eyes he has,\u201d whispered my aunt, \u201cthey got so big,\nbecause when he was almost dead with famishing in the desert, he all at\nonce caught sight of a date tree, with the ripe fruit hanging on it.\u201d\nUpon this, I stared at him till I thought his eyes were really of an\nuncommon size, and stuck out from his head like those of a lobster. I\nam sure my own eyes must have magnified as I stared. When church was\nout, I wanted my aunt to take me along and follow the traveler home.\nBut she said the constables would take us up, if we did; and so I never\nsaw this wonderful Arabian traveler again. But he long haunted me; and\nseveral times I dreamt of him, and thought his great eyes were grown\nstill larger and rounder; and once I had a vision of the date tree.\nIn course of time, my thoughts became more and more prone to dwell upon\nforeign things; and in a thousand ways I sought to gratify my tastes.\nWe had several pieces of furniture in the house, which had been brought\nfrom Europe. These I examined again and again, wondering where the wood\ngrew; whether the workmen who made them still survived, and what they\ncould be doing with themselves now.\nThen we had several oil-paintings and rare old engravings of my\nfather\u2019s, which he himself had bought in Paris, hanging up in the\ndining-room.\nTwo of these were sea-pieces. One represented a fat-looking, smoky\nfishing-boat, with three whiskerandoes in red caps, and their browsers\nlegs rolled up, hauling in a seine. There was high French-like land in\none corner, and a tumble-down gray lighthouse surmounting it. The waves\nwere toasted brown, and the whole picture looked mellow and old. I used\nto think a piece of it might taste good.\nThe other represented three old-fashioned French men-of-war with high\ncastles, like pagodas, on the bow and stern, such as you see in\nFroissart; and snug little turrets on top of the mast, full of little\nmen, with something undefinable in their hands. All three were sailing\nthrough a bright-blue sea, blue as Sicily skies; and they were leaning\nover on their sides at a fearful angle; and they must have been going\nvery fast, for the white spray was about the bows like a snow-storm.\nThen, we had two large green French portfolios of colored prints, more\nthan I could lift at that age. Every Saturday my brothers and sisters\nused to get them out of the corner where they were kept, and spreading\nthem on the floor, gaze at them with never-failing delight.\nThey were of all sorts. Some were pictures of Versailles, its\nmasquerades, its drawing-rooms, its fountains, and courts, and gardens,\nwith long lines of thick foliage cut into fantastic doors and windows,\nand towers and pinnacles. Others were rural scenes, full of fine skies,\npensive cows standing up to the knees in water, and shepherd-boys and\ncottages in the distance, half concealed in vineyards and vines.\nAnd others were pictures of natural history, representing rhinoceroses\nand elephants and spotted tigers; and above all there was a picture of\na great whale, as big as a ship, stuck full of harpoons, and three\nboats sailing after it as fast as they could fly.\nThen, too, we had a large library-case, that stood in the hall; an old\nbrown library-case, tall as a small house; it had a sort of basement,\nwith large doors, and a lock and key; and higher up, there were glass\ndoors, through which might be seen long rows of old books, that had\nbeen printed in Paris, and London, and Leipsic. There was a fine\nlibrary edition of the Spectator, in six large volumes with gilded\nbacks; and many a time I gazed at the word _\u201cLondon\u201d_ on the\ntitle-page. And there was a copy of D\u2019Alembert in French, and I\nwondered what a great man I would be, if by foreign travel I should\never be able to read straight along without stopping, out of that book,\nwhich now was a riddle to every one in the house but my father, whom I\nso much liked to hear talk French, as he sometimes did to a servant we\nhad.\nThat servant, too, I used to gaze at with wonder; for in answer to my\nincredulous cross-questions, he had over and over again assured me,\nthat he had really been born in Paris. But this I never entirely\nbelieved; for it seemed so hard to comprehend, how a man who had been\nborn in a foreign country, could be dwelling with me in our house in\nAmerica.\nAs years passed on, this continual dwelling upon foreign associations,\nbred in me a vague prophetic thought, that I was fated, one day or\nother, to be a great voyager; and that just as my father used to\nentertain strange gentlemen over their wine after dinner, I would\nhereafter be telling my own adventures to an eager auditory. And I have\nno doubt that this presentiment had something to do with bringing about\nmy subsequent rovings.\nBut that which perhaps more than any thing else, converted my vague\ndreamings and longings into a definite purpose of seeking my fortune on\nthe sea, was an old-fashioned glass ship, about eighteen inches long,\nand of French manufacture, which my father, some thirty years before,\nhad brought home from Hamburg as a present to a great-uncle of mine:\nSenator Wellingborough, who had died a member of Congress in the days\nof the old Constitution, and after whom I had the honor of being named.\nUpon the decease of the Senator, the ship was returned to the donor.\nIt was kept in a square glass case, which was regularly dusted by one\nof my sisters every morning, and stood on a little claw-footed Dutch\ntea-table in one corner of the sitting-room. This ship, after being the\nadmiration of my father\u2019s visitors in the capital, became the wonder\nand delight of all the people of the village where we now resided, many\nof whom used to call upon my mother, for no other purpose than to see\nthe ship. And well did it repay the long and curious examinations which\nthey were accustomed to give it.\nIn the first place, every bit of it was glass, and that was a great\nwonder of itself; because the masts, yards, and ropes were made to\nresemble exactly the corresponding parts of a real vessel that could go\nto sea. She carried two tiers of black guns all along her two decks;\nand often I used to try to peep in at the portholes, to see what else\nwas inside; but the holes were so small, and it looked so very dark\nindoors, that I could discover little or nothing; though, when I was\nvery little, I made no doubt, that if I could but once pry open the\nhull, and break the glass all to pieces, I would infallibly light upon\nsomething wonderful, perhaps some gold guineas, of which I have always\nbeen in want, ever since I could remember. And often I used to feel a\nsort of insane desire to be the death of the glass ship, case, and all,\nin order to come at the plunder; and one day, throwing out some hint of\nthe kind to my sisters, they ran to my mother in a great clamor; and\nafter that, the ship was placed on the mantel-piece for a time, beyond\nmy reach, and until I should recover my reason.\nI do not know how to account for this temporary madness of mine, unless\nit was, that I had been reading in a story-book about Captain Kidd\u2019s\nship, that lay somewhere at the bottom of the Hudson near the\nHighlands, full of gold as it could be; and that a company of men were\ntrying to dive down and get the treasure out of the hold, which no one\nhad ever thought of doing before, though there she had lain for almost\na hundred years.\nNot to speak of the tall masts, and yards, and rigging of this famous\nship, among whose mazes of spun-glass I used to rove in imagination,\ntill I grew dizzy at the main-truck, I will only make mention of the\npeople on board of her. They, too, were all of glass, as beautiful\nlittle glass sailors as any body ever saw, with hats and shoes on, just\nlike living men, and curious blue jackets with a sort of ruffle round\nthe bottom. Four or five of these sailors were very nimble little\nchaps, and were mounting up the rigging with very long strides; but for\nall that, they never gained a single inch in the year, as I can take my\noath.\nAnother sailor was sitting astride of the spanker-boom, with his arms\nover his head, but I never could find out what that was for; a second\nwas in the fore-top, with a coil of glass rigging over his shoulder;\nthe cook, with a glass ax, was splitting wood near the fore-hatch; the\nsteward, in a glass apron, was hurrying toward the cabin with a plate\nof glass pudding; and a glass dog, with a red mouth, was barking at\nhim; while the captain in a glass cap was smoking a glass cigar on the\nquarterdeck. He was leaning against the bulwark, with one hand to his\nhead; perhaps he was unwell, for he looked very glassy out of the eyes.\nThe name of this curious ship was _La Reine,_ or The Queen, which was\npainted on her stern where any one might read it, among a crowd of\nglass dolphins and sea-horses carved there in a sort of semicircle.\nAnd this Queen rode undisputed mistress of a green glassy sea, some of\nwhose waves were breaking over her bow in a wild way, I can tell you,\nand I used to be giving her up for lost and foundered every moment,\ntill I grew older, and perceived that she was not in the slightest\ndanger in the world.\nA good deal of dust, and fuzzy stuff like down, had in the course of\nmany years worked through the joints of the case, in which the ship was\nkept, so as to cover all the sea with a light dash of white, which if\nany thing improved the general effect, for it looked like the foam and\nfroth raised by the terrible gale the good Queen was battling against.\nSo much for _La Reine._ We have her yet in the house, but many of her\nglass spars and ropes are now sadly shattered and broken,\u2014but I will\nnot have her mended; and her figurehead, a gallant warrior in a\ncocked-hat, lies pitching headforemost down into the trough of a\ncalamitous sea under the bows\u2014but I will not have him put on his legs\nagain, till I get on my own; for between him and me there is a secret\nsympathy; and my sisters tell me, even yet, that he fell from his perch\nthe very day I left home to go to sea on this _my first voyage._\nCHAPTER II.\nREDBURN\u2019S DEPARTURE FROM HOME\nIt was with a heavy heart and full eyes, that my poor mother parted\nwith me; perhaps she thought me an erring and a willful boy, and\nperhaps I was; but if I was, it had been a hardhearted world, and hard\ntimes that had made me so. I had learned to think much and bitterly\nbefore my time; all my young mounting dreams of glory had left me; and\nat that early age, I was as unambitious as a man of sixty.\nYes, I will go to sea; cut my kind uncles and aunts, and sympathizing\npatrons, and leave no heavy hearts but those in my own home, and take\nnone along but the one which aches in my bosom. Cold, bitter cold as\nDecember, and bleak as its blasts, seemed the world then to me; there\nis no misanthrope like a boy disappointed; and such was I, with the\nwarmth of me flogged out by adversity. But these thoughts are bitter\nenough even now, for they have not yet gone quite away; and they must\nbe uncongenial enough to the reader; so no more of that, and let me go\non with my story.\n\u201cYes, I will write you, dear mother, as soon as I can,\u201d murmured I, as\nshe charged me for the hundredth time, not fail to inform her of my\nsafe arrival in New York.\n\u201cAnd now Mary, Martha, and Jane, kiss me all round, dear sisters, and\nthen I am off. I\u2019ll be back in four months\u2014it will be autumn then, and\nwe\u2019ll go into the woods after nuts, an I\u2019ll tell you all about Europe.\nGood-by! good-by!\u201d\nSo I broke loose from their arms, and not daring to look behind, ran\naway as fast as I could, till I got to the corner where my brother was\nwaiting. He accompanied me part of the way to the place, where the\nsteamboat was to leave for New York; instilling into me much sage\nadvice above his age, for he was but eight years my senior, and warning\nme again and again to take care of myself; and I solemnly promised I\nwould; for what cast-away will not promise to take of care himself,\nwhen he sees that unless he himself does, no one else will.\nWe walked on in silence till I saw that his strength was giving out,\u2014he\nwas in ill health then,\u2014and with a mute grasp of the hand, and a loud\nthump at the heart, we parted.\nIt was early on a raw, cold, damp morning toward the end of spring, and\nthe world was before me; stretching away a long muddy road, lined with\ncomfortable houses, whose inmates were taking their sunrise naps,\nheedless of the wayfarer passing. The cold drops of drizzle trickled\ndown my leather cap, and mingled with a few hot tears on my cheeks.\nI had the whole road to myself, for no one was yet stirring, and I\nwalked on, with a slouching, dogged gait. The gray shooting-jacket was\non my back, and from the end of my brother\u2019s rifle hung a small bundle\nof my clothes. My fingers worked moodily at the stock and trigger, and\nI thought that this indeed was the way to begin life, with a gun in\nyour hand!\nTalk not of the bitterness of middle-age and after life; a boy can feel\nall that, and much more, when upon his young soul the mildew has\nfallen; and the fruit, which with others is only blasted after\nripeness, with him is nipped in the first blossom and bud. And never\nagain can such blights be made good; they strike in too deep, and leave\nsuch a scar that the air of Paradise might not erase it. And it is a\nhard and cruel thing thus in early youth to taste beforehand the pangs\nwhich should be reserved for the stout time of manhood, when the\ngristle has become bone, and we stand up and fight out our lives, as a\nthing tried before and foreseen; for then we are veterans used to\nsieges and battles, and not green recruits, recoiling at the first\nshock of the encounter.\nAt last gaining the boat we pushed off, and away we steamed down the\nHudson. There were few passengers on board, the day was so unpleasant;\nand they were mostly congregated in the after cabin round the stoves.\nAfter breakfast, some of them went to reading: others took a nap on the\nsettees; and others sat in silent circles, speculating, no doubt, as to\nwho each other might be.\nThey were certainly a cheerless set, and to me they all looked\nstony-eyed and heartless. I could not help it, I almost hated them; and\nto avoid them, went on deck, but a storm of sleet drove me below. At\nlast I bethought me, that I had not procured a ticket, and going to the\ncaptain\u2019s office to pay my passage and get one, was horror-struck to\nfind, that the price of passage had been suddenly raised that day,\nowing to the other boats not running; so that I had not enough money to\npay for my fare. I had supposed it would be but a dollar, and only a\ndollar did I have, whereas it was two. What was to be done? The boat\nwas off, and there was no backing out; so I determined to say nothing\nto any body, and grimly wait until called upon for my fare.\nThe long weary day wore on till afternoon; one incessant storm raged on\ndeck; but after dinner the few passengers, waked up with their\nroast-beef and mutton, became a little more sociable. Not with me, for\nthe scent and savor of poverty was upon me, and they all cast toward me\ntheir evil eyes and cold suspicious glances, as I sat apart, though\namong them. I felt that desperation and recklessness of poverty which\nonly a pauper knows. There was a mighty patch upon one leg of my\ntrowsers, neatly sewed on, for it had been executed by my mother, but\nstill very obvious and incontrovertible to the eye. This patch I had\nhitherto studiously endeavored to hide with the ample skirts of my\nshooting-jacket; but now I stretched out my leg boldly, and thrust the\npatch under their noses, and looked at them so, that they soon looked\naway, boy though I was. Perhaps the gun that I clenched frightened them\ninto respect; or there might have been something ugly in my eye; or my\nteeth were white, and my jaws were set. For several hours, I sat gazing\nat a jovial party seated round a mahogany table, with some crackers and\ncheese, and wine and cigars. Their faces were flushed with the good\ndinner they had eaten; and mine felt pale and wan with a long fast. If\nI had presumed to offer to make one of their party; if I had told them\nof my circumstances, and solicited something to refresh me, I very well\nknew from the peculiar hollow ring of their laughter, they would have\nhad the waiters put me out of the cabin, for a beggar, who had no\nbusiness to be warming himself at their stove. And for that insult,\nthough only a conceit, I sat and gazed at them, putting up no petitions\nfor their prosperity. My whole soul was soured within me, and when at\nlast the captain\u2019s clerk, a slender young man, dressed in the height of\nfashion, with a gold watch chain and broach, came round collecting the\ntickets, I buttoned up my coat to the throat, clutched my gun, put on\nmy leather cap, and pulling it well down, stood up like a sentry before\nhim. He held out his hand, deeming any remark superfluous, as his\nobject in pausing before me must be obvious. But I stood motionless and\nsilent, and in a moment he saw how it was with me. I ought to have\nspoken and told him the case, in plain, civil terms, and offered my\ndollar, and then waited the event. But I felt too wicked for that. He\ndid not wait a great while, but spoke first himself; and in a gruff\nvoice, very unlike his urbane accents when accosting the wine and cigar\nparty, demanded my ticket. I replied that I had none. He then demanded\nthe money; and upon my answering that I had not enough, in a loud angry\nvoice that attracted all eyes, he ordered me out of the cabin into the\nstorm. The devil in me then mounted up from my soul, and spread over my\nframe, till it tingled at my finger ends; and I muttered out my\nresolution to stay where I was, in such a manner, that the ticket man\nfaltered back. \u201cThere\u2019s a dollar for you,\u201d I added, offering it.\n\u201cI want two,\u201d said he.\n\u201cTake that or nothing,\u201d I answered; \u201cit is all I have.\u201d\nI thought he would strike me. But, accepting the money, he contented\nhimself with saying something about sportsmen going on shooting\nexpeditions, without having money to pay their expenses; and hinted\nthat such chaps might better lay aside their fowling-pieces, and assume\nthe buck and saw. He then passed on, and left every eye fastened upon\nme.\nI stood their gazing some time, but at last could stand it no more. I\npushed my seat right up before the most insolent gazer, a short fat\nman, with a plethora of cravat round his neck, and fixing my gaze on\nhis, gave him more gazes than he sent. This somewhat embarrassed him,\nand he looked round for some one to take hold of me; but no one coming,\nhe pretended to be very busy counting the gilded wooden beams overhead.\nI then turned to the next gazer, and clicking my gun-lock, deliberately\npresented the piece at him.\nUpon this, he overset his seat in his eagerness to get beyond my range,\nfor I had him point blank, full in the left eye; and several persons\nstarting to their feet, exclaimed that I must be crazy. So I was at\nthat time; for otherwise I know not how to account for my demoniac\nfeelings, of which I was afterward heartily ashamed, as I ought to have\nbeen, indeed; and much more than that.\nI then turned on my heel, and shouldering my fowling-piece and bundle,\nmarched on deck, and walked there through the dreary storm, till I was\nwet through, and the boat touched the wharf at New York.\nSuch is boyhood.\nCHAPTER III.\nHE ARRIVES IN TOWN\nFrom the boat\u2019s bow, I jumped ashore, before she was secured, and\nfollowing my brother\u2019s directions, proceeded across the town toward St.\nJohn\u2019s Park, to the house of a college friend of his, for whom I had a\nletter.\nIt was a long walk; and I stepped in at a sort of grocery to get a\ndrink of water, where some six or eight rough looking fellows were\nplaying dominoes upon the counter, seated upon cheese boxes. They\nwinked, and asked what sort of sport I had had gunning on such a rainy\nday, but I only gulped down my water and stalked off.\nDripping like a seal, I at last grounded arms at the doorway of my\nbrother\u2019s friend, rang the bell and inquired for him.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d said the servant, eying me as if I were a\nhousebreaker.\n\u201cI want to see your lord and master; show me into the parlor.\u201d\nUpon this my host himself happened to make his appearance, and seeing\nwho I was, opened his hand and heart to me at once, and drew me to his\nfireside; he had received a letter from my brother, and had expected me\nthat day.\nThe family were at tea; the fragrant herb filled the room with its\naroma; the brown toast was odoriferous; and everything pleasant and\ncharming. After a temporary warming, I was shown to a room, where I\nchanged my wet dress, and returning to the table, found that the\ninterval had been well improved by my hostess; a meal for a traveler\nwas spread and I laid into it sturdily. Every mouthful pushed the devil\nthat had been tormenting me all day farther and farther out of me, till\nat last I entirely ejected him with three successive bowls of Bohea.\nMagic of kind words, and kind deeds, and good tea! That night I went to\nbed thinking the world pretty tolerable, after all; and I could hardly\nbelieve that I had really acted that morning as I had, for I was\nnaturally of an easy and forbearing disposition; though when such a\ndisposition is temporarily roused, it is perhaps worse than a\ncannibal\u2019s.\nNext day, my brother\u2019s friend, whom I choose to call Mr. Jones,\naccompanied me down to the docks among the shipping, in order to get me\na place. After a good deal of searching we lighted upon a ship for\nLiverpool, and found the captain in the cabin; which was a very\nhandsome one, lined with mahogany and maple; and the steward, an\nelegant looking mulatto in a gorgeous turban, was setting out on a sort\nof sideboard some dinner service which looked like silver, but it was\nonly Britannia ware highly polished.\nAs soon as I clapped my eye on the captain, I thought myself he was\njust the captain to suit me. He was a fine looking man, about forty,\nsplendidly dressed, with very black whiskers, and very white teeth, and\nwhat I took to be a free, frank look out of a large hazel eye. I liked\nhim amazingly. He was promenading up and down the cabin, humming some\nbrisk air to himself when we entered.\n\u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d said my friend.\n\u201cGood morning, good morning, sir,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSteward, chairs\nfor the gentlemen.\u201d\n\u201cOh! never mind, sir,\u201d said Mr. Jones, rather taken aback by his\nextreme civility. \u201cI merely called to see whether you want a fine young\nlad to go to sea with you. Here he is; he has long wanted to be a\nsailor; and his friends have at last concluded to let him go for one\nvoyage, and see how he likes it.\u201d\n\u201cAh! indeed!\u201d said the captain, blandly, and looking where I stood.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fine fellow; I like him. So you want to be a sailor, my boy, do\nyou?\u201d added he, affectionately patting my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard life,\nthough; a hard life.\u201d\nBut when I looked round at his comfortable, and almost luxurious cabin,\nand then at his handsome care-free face, I thought he was only trying\nto frighten me, and I answered, \u201cWell, sir, I am ready to try it.\u201d\n\u201cI hope he\u2019s a country lad, sir,\u201d said the captain to my friend, \u201cthese\ncity boys are sometimes hard cases.\u201d\n\u201cOh! yes, he\u2019s from the country,\u201d was the reply, \u201cand of a highly\nrespectable family; his great-uncle died a Senator.\u201d\n\u201cBut his great-uncle don\u2019t want to go to sea too?\u201d said the captain,\nlooking funny.\n\u201cOh! no, oh, no!\u2014 Ha! ha!\u201d\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d echoed the captain.\nA fine funny gentleman, thought I, not much fancying, however, his\nlevity concerning my great-uncle, he\u2019ll be cracking his jokes the whole\nvoyage; and so I afterward said to one of the riggers on board; but he\nbade me look out, that he did not crack my head.\n\u201cWell, my lad,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI suppose you know we haven\u2019t any\npastures and cows on board; you can\u2019t get any milk at sea, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh! I know all about that, sir; my father has crossed the ocean, if I\nhaven\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d cried my friend, \u201chis father, a gentleman of one of the first\nfamilies in America, crossed the Atlantic several times on important\nbusiness.\u201d\n\u201cEmbassador extraordinary?\u201d said the captain, looking funny again.\n\u201cOh! no, he was a wealthy merchant.\u201d\n\u201cAh! indeed;\u201d said the captain, looking grave and bland again, \u201cthen\nthis fine lad is the son of a gentleman?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said my friend, \u201cand he\u2019s only going to sea for the humor\nof it; they want to send him on his travels with a tutor, but he _will_\ngo to sea as a sailor.\u201d\nThe fact was, that my young friend (for he was only about twenty-five)\nwas not a very wise man; and this was a huge fib, which out of the\nkindness of his heart, he told in my behalf, for the purpose of\ncreating a profound respect for me in the eyes of my future lord.\nUpon being apprized, that I had willfully forborne taking the grand\ntour with a tutor, in order to put my hand in a tar-bucket, the\nhandsome captain looked ten times more funny than ever; and said that\n_he_ himself would be my tutor, and take me on my travels, and pay for\nthe privilege.\n\u201cAh!\u201d said my friend, \u201cthat reminds me of business. Pray, captain, how\nmuch do you generally pay a handsome young fellow like this?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the captain, looking grave and profound, \u201cwe are not so\nparticular about beauty, and we never give more than three dollars to a\ngreen lad like Wellingborough here, that\u2019s your name, my boy?\nWellingborough Redburn!\u2014Upon my soul, a fine sounding name.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, captain,\u201d said Mr. Jones, quickly interrupting him, \u201cthat won\u2019t\npay for his clothing.\u201d\n\u201cBut you know his highly respectable and wealthy relations will\ndoubtless see to all that,\u201d replied the captain, with his funny look\nagain.\n\u201cOh! yes, I forgot that,\u201d said Mr. Jones, looking rather foolish. \u201cHis\nfriends will of course see to that.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said the captain smiling.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d repeated Mr. Jones, looking ruefully at the patch on my\npantaloons, which just then I endeavored to hide with the skirt of my\nshooting-jacket.\n\u201cYou are quite a sportsman I see,\u201d said the captain, eying the great\nbuttons on my coat, upon each of which was a carved fox.\nUpon this my benevolent friend thought that here was a grand\nopportunity to befriend me.\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s quite a sportsman,\u201d said he, \u201che\u2019s got a very valuable\nfowling-piece at home, perhaps you would like to purchase it, captain,\nto shoot gulls with at sea? It\u2019s cheap.\u201d\n\u201cOh! no, he had better leave it with his relations,\u201d said the captain,\n\u201cso that he can go hunting again when he returns from England.\u201d\n\u201cYes, perhaps that _would_ be better, after all,\u201d said my friend,\npretending to fall into a profound musing, involving all sides of the\nmatter in hand. \u201cWell, then, captain, you can only give the boy three\ndollars a month, you say?\u201d\n\u201cOnly three dollars a month,\u201d said the captain.\n\u201cAnd I believe,\u201d said my friend, \u201cthat you generally give something in\nadvance, do you not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that is sometimes the custom at the shipping offices,\u201d said the\ncaptain, with a bow, \u201cbut in this case, as the boy has rich relations,\nthere will be no need of that, you know.\u201d\nAnd thus, by his ill-advised, but well-meaning hints concerning the\nrespectability of my paternity, and the immense wealth of my relations,\ndid this really honest-hearted but foolish friend of mine, prevent me\nfrom getting three dollars in advance, which I greatly needed. However,\nI said nothing, though I thought the more; and particularly, how that\nit would have been much better for me, to have gone on board alone,\naccosted the captain on my own account, and told him the plain truth.\nPoor people make a very poor business of it when they try to seem rich.\nThe arrangement being concluded, we bade the captain good morning; and\nas we were about leaving the cabin, he smiled again, and said, \u201cWell,\nRedburn, my boy, you won\u2019t get home-sick before you sail, because that\nwill make you very sea-sick when you get to sea.\u201d\nAnd with that he smiled very pleasantly, and bowed two or three times,\nand told the steward to open the cabin-door, which the steward did with\na peculiar sort of grin on his face, and a slanting glance at my\nshooting-jacket. And so we left.\nCHAPTER IV.\nHOW HE DISPOSED OF HIS FOWLING-PIECE\nNext day I went alone to the shipping office to sign the articles, and\nthere I met a great crowd of sailors, who as soon as they found what I\nwas after, began to tip the wink all round, and I overheard a fellow in\na great flapping sou\u2019wester cap say to another old tar in a shaggy\nmonkey-jacket, \u201cTwig his coat, d\u2019ye see the buttons, that chap ain\u2019t\ngoing to sea in a merchantman, he\u2019s going to shoot whales. I say,\nmaty\u2014look here\u2014how d\u2019ye sell them big buttons by the pound?\u201d\n\u201cGive us one for a saucer, will ye?\u201d said another.\n\u201cLet the youngster alone,\u201d said a third. \u201cCome here, my little boy, has\nyour ma put up some sweetmeats for ye to take to sea?\u201d\nThey are all witty dogs, thought I to myself, trying to make the best\nof the matter, for I saw it would not do to resent what they said; they\ncan\u2019t mean any harm, though they are certainly very impudent; so I\ntried to laugh off their banter, but as soon as ever I could, I put\ndown my name and beat a retreat.\nOn the morrow, the ship was advertised to sail. So the rest of that day\nI spent in preparations. After in vain trying to sell my fowling-piece\nfor a fair price to chance customers, I was walking up Chatham-street\nwith it, when a curly-headed little man with a dark oily face, and a\nhooked nose, like the pictures of Judas Iscariot, called to me from a\nstrange-looking shop, with three gilded balls hanging over it.\nWith a peculiar accent, as if he had been over-eating himself with\nIndian-pudding or some other plushy compound, this curly-headed little\nman very civilly invited me into his shop; and making a polite bow, and\nbidding me many unnecessary good mornings, and remarking upon the fine\nweather, begged me to let him look at my fowling-piece. I handed it to\nhim in an instant, glad of the chance of disposing of it, and told him\nthat was just what I wanted.\n\u201cAh!\u201d said he, with his Indian-pudding accent again, which I will not\ntry to mimic, and abating his look of eagerness, \u201cI thought it was a\nbetter article, it\u2019s very old.\u201d\n\u201cNot,\u201d said I, starting in surprise, \u201cit\u2019s not been used more than\nthree times; what will you give for it?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t _buy_ any thing here,\u201d said he, suddenly looking very\nindifferent, \u201cthis is a place where people _pawn_ things.\u201d _Pawn_ being\na word I had never heard before, I asked him what it meant; when he\nreplied, that when people wanted any money, they came to him with their\nfowling-pieces, and got one third its value, and then left the\nfowling-piece there, until they were able to pay back the money.\nWhat a benevolent little old man, this must be, thought I, and how very\nobliging.\n\u201cAnd pray,\u201d said I, \u201chow much will you let me have for my gun, by way\nof a pawn?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose it\u2019s worth six dollars, and seeing you\u2019re a boy, I\u2019ll\nlet you have three dollars upon it\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d exclaimed I, seizing the fowling-piece, \u201cit\u2019s worth five times\nthat, I\u2019ll go somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning, then,\u201d said he, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll do better,\u201d and he bowed\nme out as if he expected to see me again pretty soon.\nI had not gone very far when I came across three more balls hanging\nover a shop. In I went, and saw a long counter, with a sort of\npicket-fence, running all along from end to end, and three little\nholes, with three little old men standing inside of them, like\nprisoners looking out of a jail. Back of the counter were all sorts of\nthings, piled up and labeled. Hats, and caps, and coats, and guns, and\nswords, and canes, and chests, and planes, and books, and\nwriting-desks, and every thing else. And in a glass case were lots of\nwatches, and seals, chains, and rings, and breastpins, and all kinds of\ntrinkets. At one of the little holes, earnestly talking with one of the\nhook-nosed men, was a thin woman in a faded silk gown and shawl,\nholding a pale little girl by the hand. As I drew near, she spoke lower\nin a whisper; and the man shook his head, and looked cross and rude;\nand then some more words were exchanged over a miniature, and some\nmoney was passed through the hole, and the woman and child shrank out\nof the door.\nI won\u2019t sell my gun to that man, thought I; and I passed on to the next\nhole; and while waiting there to be served, an elderly man in a\nhigh-waisted surtout, thrust a silver snuff-box through; and a young\nman in a calico shirt and a shiny coat with a velvet collar presented a\nsilver watch; and a sheepish boy in a cloak took out a frying-pan; and\nanother little boy had a Bible; and all these things were thrust\nthrough to the hook-nosed man, who seemed ready to hook any thing that\ncame along; so I had no doubt he would gladly hook my gun, for the long\npicketed counter seemed like a great seine, that caught every variety\nof fish.\nAt last I saw a chance, and crowded in for the hole; and in order to be\nbeforehand with a big man who just then came in, I pushed my gun\nviolently through the hole; upon which the hook-nosed man cried out,\nthinking I was going to shoot him. But at last he took the gun, turned\nit end for end, clicked the trigger three times, and then said, \u201cone\ndollar.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about one dollar?\u201d said I.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll give,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cWell, what do you want?\u201d and he turned to the next person. This was a\nyoung man in a seedy red cravat and a pimply face, that looked as if it\nwas going to seed likewise, who, with a mysterious tapping of his\nvest-pocket and other hints, made a great show of having something\nconfidential to communicate.\nBut the hook-nosed man spoke out very loud, and said, \u201cNone of that;\ntake it out. Got a stolen watch? We don\u2019t deal in them things here.\u201d\nUpon this the young man flushed all over, and looked round to see who\nhad heard the pawnbroker; then he took something very small out of his\npocket, and keeping it hidden under his palm, pushed it into the hole.\n\u201cWhere did you get this ring?\u201d said the pawnbroker.\n\u201cI want to pawn it,\u201d whispered the other, blushing all over again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d said the pawnbroker, speaking very loud.\n\u201cHow much will you give?\u201d whispered the other in reply, leaning over,\nand looking as if he wanted to hush up the pawnbroker.\nAt last the sum was agreed upon, when the man behind the counter took a\nlittle ticket, and tying the ring to it began to write on the ticket;\nall at once he asked the young man where he lived, a question which\nembarrassed him very much; but at last he stammered out a certain\nnumber in Broadway.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the City Hotel: you don\u2019t live there,\u201d said the man, cruelly\nglancing at the shabby coat before him.\n\u201cOh! well,\u201d stammered the other blushing scarlet, \u201cI thought this was\nonly a sort of form to go through; I don\u2019t like to tell where I do\nlive, for I ain\u2019t in the habit of going to pawnbrokers.\u201d\n\u201cYou stole that ring, you know you did,\u201d roared out the hook-nosed man,\nincensed at this slur upon his calling, and now seemingly bent on\ndamaging the young man\u2019s character for life. \u201cI\u2019m a good mind to call a\nconstable; we don\u2019t take stolen goods here, I tell you.\u201d\nAll eyes were now fixed suspiciously upon this martyrized young man;\nwho looked ready to drop into the earth; and a poor woman in a\nnight-cap, with some baby-clothes in her hand, looked fearfully at the\npawnbroker, as if dreading to encounter such a terrible pattern of\nintegrity. At last the young man sunk off with his money, and looking\nout of the window, I saw him go round the corner so sharply that he\nknocked his elbow against the wall.\nI waited a little longer, and saw several more served; and having\nremarked that the hook-nosed men invariably fixed their own price upon\nevery thing, and if that was refused told the person to be off with\nhimself; I concluded that it would be of no use to try and get more\nfrom them than they had offered; especially when I saw that they had a\ngreat many fowling-pieces hanging up, and did not have particular\noccasion for mine; and more than that, they must be very well off and\nrich, to treat people so cavalierly.\nMy best plan then seemed to be to go right back to the curly-headed\npawnbroker, and take up with my first offer. But when I went back, the\ncurly-headed man was very busy about something else, and kept me\nwaiting a long time; at last I got a chance and told him I would take\nthe three dollars he had offered.\n\u201cOught to have taken it when you could get it,\u201d he replied. \u201cI won\u2019t\ngive but two dollars and a half for it now.\u201d\nIn vain I expostulated; he was not to be moved, so I pocketed the money\nand departed.\nCHAPTER V.\nHE PURCHASES HIS SEA-WARDROBE, AND ON A DISMAL RAINY DAY PICKS UP HIS\nBOARD AND LODGING ALONG THE WHARVES\nThe first thing I now did was to buy a little stationery, and keep my\npromise to my mother, by writing her; and I also wrote to my brother\ninforming him of the voyage I purposed making, and indulging in some\nromantic and misanthropic views of life, such as many boys in my\ncircumstances, are accustomed to do.\nThe rest of the two dollars and a half I laid out that very morning in\nbuying a red woolen shirt near Catharine Market, a tarpaulin hat, which\nI got at an out-door stand near Peck Slip, a belt and jackknife, and\ntwo or three trifles. After these purchases, I had only one penny left,\nso I walked out to the end of the pier, and threw the penny into the\nwater. The reason why I did this, was because I somehow felt almost\ndesperate again, and didn\u2019t care what became of me. But if the penny\nhad been a dollar, I would have kept it.\nI went home to dinner at Mr. Jones\u2019, and they welcomed me very kindly,\nand Mrs. Jones kept my plate full all the time during dinner, so that I\nhad no chance to empty it. She seemed to see that I felt bad, and\nthought plenty of pudding might help me. At any rate, I never felt so\nbad yet but I could eat a good dinner. And once, years afterward, when\nI expected to be killed every day, I remember my appetite was very\nkeen, and I said to myself, \u201cEat away, Wellingborough, while you can,\nfor this may be the last supper you will have.\u201d\nAfter dinner I went into my room, locked the door carefully, and hung a\ntowel over the knob, so that no one could peep through the keyhole, and\nthen went to trying on my red woolen shirt before the glass, to see\nwhat sort of a looking sailor I was going to make. As soon as I got\ninto the shirt I began to feel sort of warm and red about the face,\nwhich I found was owing to the reflection of the dyed wool upon my\nskin. After that, I took a pair of scissors and went to cutting my\nhair, which was very long. I thought every little would help, in making\nme a light hand to run aloft.\nNext morning I bade my kind host and hostess good-by, and left the\nhouse with my bundle, feeling somewhat misanthropical and desperate\nagain.\nBefore I reached the ship, it began to rain hard; and as soon as I\narrived at the wharf, it was plain that there would be no getting to\nsea that day.\nThis was a great disappointment to me, for I did not want to return to\nMr. Jones\u2019 again after bidding them good-by; it would be so awkward. So\nI concluded to go on board ship for the present.\nWhen I reached the deck, I saw no one but a large man in a large\ndripping pea-jacket, who was calking down the main-hatches.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Pillgarlic?\u201d said he.\n\u201cI\u2019ve shipped to sail in this ship,\u201d I replied, assuming a little\ndignity, to chastise his familiarity.\n\u201cWhat for? a tailor?\u201d said he, looking at my shooting jacket.\nI answered that I was going as a \u201cboy;\u201d for so I was technically put\ndown on the articles.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201chave you got your traps aboard?\u201d\nI told him I didn\u2019t know there were any rats in the ship, and hadn\u2019t\nbrought any \u201ctrap.\u201d\nAt this he laughed out with a great guffaw, and said there must be\nhay-seed in my hair.\nThis made me mad; but thinking he must be one of the sailors who was\ngoing in the ship, I thought it wouldn\u2019t be wise to make an enemy of\nhim, so only asked him where the men slept in the vessel, for I wanted\nto put my clothes away.\n_\u201cWhere\u2019s_ your clothes?\u201d said he.\n\u201cHere in my bundle,\u201d said I, holding it up.\n\u201cWell if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou\u2019d better chuck it\noverboard. But go forward, go forward to the forecastle; that\u2019s the\nplace you\u2019ll live in aboard here.\u201d\nAnd with that he directed me to a sort of hole in the deck in the bow\nof the ship; but looking down, and seeing how dark it was, I asked him\nfor a light.\n\u201cStrike your eyes together and make one,\u201d said he, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any\nlights here.\u201d So I groped my way down into the forecastle, which smelt\nso bad of old ropes and tar, that it almost made me sick. After waiting\npatiently, I began to see a little; and looking round, at last\nperceived I was in a smoky looking place, with twelve wooden boxes\nstuck round the sides. In some of these boxes were large chests, which\nI at once supposed to belong to the sailors, who must have taken that\nmethod of appropriating their \u201cTrunks,\u201d as I afterward found these\nboxes were called. And so it turned out.\nAfter examining them for a while, I selected an empty one, and put my\nbundle right in the middle of it, so that there might be no mistake\nabout my claim to the place, particularly as the bundle was so small.\nThis done, I was glad to get on deck; and learning to a certainty that\nthe ship would not sail till the next day, I resolved to go ashore, and\nwalk about till dark, and then return and sleep out the night in the\nforecastle. So I walked about all over, till I was weary, and went into\na mean liquor shop to rest; for having my tarpaulin on, and not looking\nvery gentlemanly, I was afraid to go into any better place, for fear of\nbeing driven out. Here I sat till I began to feel very hungry; and\nseeing some doughnuts on the counter, I began to think what a fool I\nhad been, to throw away my last penny; for the doughnuts were but a\npenny apiece, and they looked very plump, and fat, and round. I never\nsaw doughnuts look so enticing before; especially when a negro came in,\nand ate one before my eyes. At last I thought I would fill up a little\nby drinking a glass of water; having read somewhere that this was a\ngood plan to follow in a case like the present. I did not feel thirsty,\nbut only hungry; so had much ado to get down the water; for it tasted\nwarm; and the tumbler had an ugly flavor; the negro had been drinking\nsome spirits out of it just before.\nI marched off again, every once in a while stopping to take in some\nmore water, and being very careful not to step into the same shop\ntwice, till night came on, and I found myself soaked through, for it\nhad been raining more or less all day. As I went to the ship, I could\nnot help thinking how lonesome it would be, to spend the whole night in\nthat damp and dark forecastle, without light or fire, and nothing to\nlie on but the bare boards of my bunk. However, to drown all such\nthoughts, I gulped down another glass of water, though I was wet enough\noutside and in by this time; and trying to put on a bold look, as if I\nhad just been eating a hearty meal, I stepped aboard the ship.\nThe man in the big pea-jacket was not to be seen; but on going forward\nI unexpectedly found a young lad there, about my own age; and as soon\nas he opened his mouth I knew he was not an American. He talked such a\ncurious language though, half English and half gibberish, that I knew\nnot what to make of him; and was a little astonished, when he told me\nhe was an English boy, from Lancashire.\nIt seemed, he had come over from Liverpool in this very ship on her\nlast voyage, as a steerage passenger; but finding that he would have to\nwork very hard to get along in America, and getting home-sick into the\nbargain, he had arranged with the captain to work his passage back.\nI was glad to have some company, and tried to get him conversing; but\nfound he was the most stupid and ignorant boy I had ever met with. I\nasked him something about the river Thames; when he said that he hadn\u2019t\ntraveled any in America and didn\u2019t know any thing about the rivers\nhere. And when I told him the river Thames was in England, he showed no\nsurprise or shame at his ignorance, but only looked ten times more\nstupid than before.\nAt last we went below into the forecastle, and both getting into the\nsame bunk, stretched ourselves out on the planks, and I tried my best\nto get asleep. But though my companion soon began to snore very loud,\nfor me, I could not forget myself, owing to the horrid smell of the\nplace, my being so wet, cold, and hungry, and besides all that, I felt\ndamp and clammy about the heart. I lay turning over and over, listening\nto the Lancashire boy\u2019s snoring, till at last I felt so, that I had to\ngo on deck; and there I walked till morning, which I thought would\nnever come.\nAs soon as I thought the groceries on the wharf would be open I left\nthe ship and went to make my breakfast of another glass of water. But\nthis made me very qualmish; and soon I felt sick as death; my head was\ndizzy; and I went staggering along the walk, almost blind. At last I\ndropt on a heap of chain-cable, and shutting my eyes hard, did my best\nto rally myself, in which I succeeded, at last, enough to get up and\nwalk off. Then I thought that I had done wrong in not returning to my\nfriend\u2019s house the day before; and would have walked there now, as it\nwas, only it was at least three miles up town; too far for me to walk\nin such a state, and I had no sixpence to ride in an omnibus.\nCHAPTER VI.\nHE IS INITIATED IN THE BUSINESS OF CLEANING OUT THE PIG-PEN, AND\nSLUSHING DOWN THE TOP-MAST\nBy the time I got back to the ship, every thing was in an uproar. The\npea-jacket man was there, ordering about a good many men in the\nrigging, and people were bringing off chickens, and pigs, and beef, and\nvegetables from the shore. Soon after, another man, in a striped calico\nshirt, a short blue jacket and beaver hat, made his appearance, and\nwent to ordering about the man in the big pea-jacket; and at last the\ncaptain came up the side, and began to order about both of them.\nThese two men turned out to be the first and second mates of the ship.\nThinking to make friends with the second mate, I took out an old\ntortoise-shell snuff-box of my father\u2019s, in which I had put a piece of\nCavendish tobacco, to look sailor-like, and offered the box to him very\npolitely. He stared at me a moment, and then exclaimed, \u201cDo you think\nwe take snuff aboard here, youngster? no, no, no time for snuff-taking\nat sea; don\u2019t let the \u2018old man\u2019 see that snuff-box; take my advice and\npitch it overboard as quick as you can.\u201d\nI told him it was not snuff, but tobacco; when he said, he had plenty\nof tobacco of his own, and never carried any such nonsense about him as\na tobacco-box. With that, he went off about his business, and left me\nfeeling foolish enough. But I had reason to be glad he had acted thus,\nfor if he had not, I think I should have offered my box to the chief\nmate, who in that case, from what I afterward learned of him, would\nhave knocked me down, or done something else equally uncivil.\nAs I was standing looking round me, the chief mate approached in a\ngreat hurry about something, and seeing me in his way, cried out,\n\u201cAshore with you, you young loafer! There\u2019s no stealings here; sail\naway, I tell you, with that shooting-jacket!\u201d\nUpon this I retreated, saying that I was going out in the ship as a\nsailor.\n\u201cA sailor!\u201d he cried, \u201ca barber\u2019s clerk, you mean; _you_ going out in\nthe ship? what, in that jacket? Hang me, I hope the old man hasn\u2019t been\nshipping any more greenhorns like you\u2014he\u2019ll make a shipwreck of it if\nhe has. But this is the way nowadays; to save a few dollars in seamen\u2019s\nwages, they think nothing of shipping a parcel of farmers and\nclodhoppers and baby-boys. What\u2019s your name, Pillgarlic?\u201d\n\u201cRedburn,\u201d said I.\n\u201cA pretty handle to a man, that; scorch you to take hold of it; haven\u2019t\nyou got any other?\u201d\n\u201cWellingborough,\u201d said I.\n\u201cWorse yet. Who had the baptizing of ye? Why didn\u2019t they call you Jack,\nor Jill, or something short and handy. But I\u2019ll baptize you over again.\nD\u2019ye hear, sir, henceforth your name is _Buttons._ And now do you go,\nButtons, and clean out that pig-pen in the long-boat; it has not been\ncleaned out since last voyage. And bear a hand about it, d\u2019ye hear;\nthere\u2019s them pigs there waiting to be put in; come, be off about it,\nnow.\u201d\nWas this then the beginning of my sea-career? set to cleaning out a\npig-pen, the very first thing?\nBut I thought it best to say nothing; I had bound myself to obey\norders, and it was too late to retreat. So I only asked for a shovel,\nor spade, or something else to work with.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t dig gardens here,\u201d was the reply; \u201cdig it out with your\nteeth!\u201d\nAfter looking round, I found a stick and went to scraping out the pen,\nwhich was awkward work enough, for another boat called the\n\u201cjolly-boat,\u201d was capsized right over the longboat, which brought them\nalmost close together. These two boats were in the middle of the deck.\nI managed to crawl inside of the long-boat; and after barking my shins\nagainst the seats, and bumping my head a good many times, I got along\nto the stern, where the pig-pen was.\nWhile I was hard at work a drunken sailor peeped in, and cried out to\nhis comrades, \u201cLook here, my lads, what sort of a pig do you call this?\nHallo! inside there! what are you \u2019bout there? trying to stow yourself\naway to steal a passage to Liverpool? Out of that! out of that, I say.\u201d\nBut just then the mate came along and ordered this drunken rascal\nashore.\nThe pig-pen being cleaned out, I was set to work picking up some\nshavings, which lay about the deck; for there had been carpenters at\nwork on board. The mate ordered me to throw these shavings into the\nlong-boat at a particular place between two of the seats. But as I\nfound it hard work to push the shavings through in that place, and as\nit looked wet there, I thought it would be better for the shavings as\nwell as myself, to thrust them where there was a larger opening and a\ndry spot. While I was thus employed, the mate observing me, exclaimed\nwith an oath, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to put those shavings somewhere else?\nDo what I tell you, now, Buttons, or mind your eye!\u201d\nStifling my indignation at his rudeness, which by this time I found was\nmy only plan, I replied that that was not so good a place for the\nshavings as that which I myself had selected, and asked him to tell me\n_why_ he wanted me to put them in the place he designated. Upon this,\nhe flew into a terrible rage, and without explanation reiterated his\norder like a clap of thunder.\nThis was my first lesson in the discipline of the sea, and I never\nforgot it. From that time I learned that sea-officers never gave\nreasons for any thing they order to be done. It is enough that they\ncommand it, so that the motto is, _\u201cObey orders, though you break\nowners.\u201d_\nI now began to feel very faint and sick _again,_ and longed for the\nship to be leaving the dock; for then I made no doubt we would soon be\nhaving something to eat. But as yet, I saw none of the sailors on\nboard, and as for the men at work in the rigging, I found out that they\nwere _\u201criggers,\u201d_ that is, men living ashore, who worked by the day in\ngetting ships ready for sea; and this I found out to my cost, for\nyielding to the kind blandishment of one of these _riggers, I_ had\nswapped away my jackknife with him for a much poorer one of his own,\nthinking to secure a sailor friend for the voyage. At last I watched my\nchance, and while people\u2019s backs were turned, I seized a carrot from\nseveral bunches lying on deck, and clapping it under the skirts of my\nshooting-jacket, went forward to eat it; for I had often eaten raw\ncarrots, which taste something like chestnuts. This carrot refreshed me\na good deal, though at the expense of a little pain in my stomach.\nHardly had I disposed of it, when I heard the chief mate\u2019s voice crying\nout for \u201cButtons.\u201d I ran after him, and received an order to go aloft\nand \u201cslush down the main-top mast.\u201d\nThis was all Greek to me, and after receiving the order, I stood\nstaring about me, wondering what it was that was to be done. But the\nmate had turned on his heel, and made no explanations. At length I\nfollowed after him, and asked what I must do.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to slush down the main-top mast?\u201d he shouted.\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said I, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d\n\u201cGreen as grass! a regular cabbage-head!\u201d he exclaimed to himself. \u201cA\nfine time I\u2019ll have with such a greenhorn aboard. Look you, youngster.\nLook up to that long pole there\u2014d\u2019ye see it? that piece of a tree\nthere, you timber-head\u2014well\u2014take this bucket here, and go up the\nrigging\u2014that rope-ladder there\u2014do you understand?\u2014and dab this slush\nall over the mast, and look out for your head if one drop falls on\ndeck. Be off now, Buttons.\u201d\nThe eventful hour had arrived; for the first time in my life I was to\nascend a ship\u2019s mast. Had I been well and hearty, perhaps I should have\nfelt a little shaky at the thought; but as I was then, weak and faint,\nthe bare thought appalled me.\nBut there was no hanging back; it would look like cowardice, and I\ncould not bring myself to confess that I was suffering for want of\nfood; so rallying again, I took up the bucket.\nIt was a heavy bucket, with strong iron hoops, and might have held\nperhaps two gallons. But it was only half full now of a sort of thick\nlobbered gravy, which I afterward learned was boiled out of the salt\nbeef used by the sailors. Upon getting into the rigging, I found it was\nno easy job to carry this heavy bucket up with me. The rope handle of\nit was so slippery with grease, that although I twisted it several\ntimes about my wrist, it would be still twirling round and round, and\nslipping off. Spite of this, however, I managed to mount as far as the\n\u201ctop,\u201d the clumsy bucket half the time straddling and swinging about\nbetween my legs, and in momentary danger of capsizing. Arrived at the\n\u201ctop,\u201d I came to a dead halt, and looked up. How to surmount that\noverhanging impediment completely posed me for the time. But at last,\nwith much straining, I contrived to place my bucket in the \u201ctop;\u201d and\nthen, trusting to Providence, swung myself up after it. The rest of the\nroad was comparatively easy; though whenever I incautiously looked down\ntoward the deck, my head spun round so from weakness, that I was\nobliged to shut my eyes to recover myself. I do not remember much more.\nI only recollect my safe return to the deck.\nIn a short time the bustle of the ship increased; the trunks of cabin\npassengers arrived, and the chests and boxes of the steerage\npassengers, besides baskets of wine and fruit for the captain.\nAt last we cast loose, and swinging out into the stream, came to\nanchor, and hoisted the signal for sailing. Every thing, it seemed, was\non board but the crew; who in a few hours after, came off, one by one,\nin Whitehall boats, their chests in the bow, and themselves lying back\nin the stem like lords; and showing very plainly the complacency they\nfelt in keeping the whole ship waiting for their lordships.\n\u201cAy, ay,\u201d muttered the chief mate, as they rolled out of then-boats and\nswaggered on deck, \u201cit\u2019s your turn now, but it will be mine before\nlong. Yaw about while you may, my hearties, I\u2019ll do the yawing after\nthe anchor\u2019s up.\u201d\nSeveral of the sailors were very drunk, and one of them was lifted on\nboard insensible by his landlord, who carried him down below and dumped\nhim into a bunk. And two other sailors, as soon as they made their\nappearance, immediately went below to sleep off the fumes of their\ndrink.\nAt last, all the crew being on board, word was passed to go to dinner\nfore and aft, an order that made my heart jump with delight, for now my\nlong fast would be broken. But though the sailors, surfeited with\neating and drinking ashore, did not then touch the salt beef and\npotatoes which the black cook handed down into the forecastle; and\nthough this left the whole allowance to me; to my surprise, I found\nthat I could eat little or nothing; for now I only felt deadly faint,\nbut not hungry.\nCHAPTER VII.\nHE GETS TO SEA AND FEELS VERY BAD\nEvery thing at last being in readiness, the pilot came on board, and\nall hands were called to up anchor. While I worked at my bar, I could\nnot help observing how haggard the men looked, and how much they\nsuffered from this violent exercise, after the terrific dissipation in\nwhich they had been indulging ashore. But I soon learnt that sailors\nbreathe nothing about such things, but strive their best to appear all\nalive and hearty, though it comes very hard for many of them.\nThe anchor being secured, a steam tug-boat with a strong name, the\nHercules, took hold of us; and away we went past the long line of\nshipping, and wharves, and warehouses; and rounded the green south\npoint of the island where the Battery is, and passed Governor\u2019s Island,\nand pointed right out for the Narrows.\nMy heart was like lead, and I felt bad enough, Heaven knows; but then,\nthere was plenty of work to be done, which kept my thoughts from\nbecoming too much for me.\nAnd I tried to think all the time, that I was going to England, and\nthat, before many months, I should have actually been there and home\nagain, telling my adventures to my brothers and sisters; and with what\ndelight they would listen, and how they would look up to me then, and\nreverence my sayings; and how that even my elder brother would be\nforced to treat me with great consideration, as having crossed the\nAtlantic Ocean, which he had never done, and there was no probability\nhe ever would.\nWith such thoughts as these I endeavored to shake off my\nheavy-heartedness; but it would not do at all; for this was only the\nfirst day of the voyage, and many weeks, nay, several whole months must\nelapse before the voyage was ended; and who could tell what might\nhappen to me; for when I looked up at the high, giddy masts, and\nthought how often I must be going up and down them, I thought sure\nenough that some luckless day or other, I would certainly fall\noverboard and be drowned. And then, I thought of lying down at the\nbottom of the sea, stark alone, with the great waves rolling over me,\nand no one in the wide world knowing that I was there. And I thought\nhow much better and sweeter it must be, to be buried under the pleasant\nhedge that bounded the sunny south side of our village grave-yard,\nwhere every Sunday I had used to walk after church in the afternoon;\nand I almost wished I was there now; yes, dead and buried in that\nchurchyard. All the time my eyes were filled with tears, and I kept\nholding my breath, to choke down the sobs, for indeed I could not help\nfeeling as I did, and no doubt any boy in the world would have felt\njust as I did then.\nAs the steamer carried us further and further down the bay, and we\npassed ships lying at anchor, with men gazing at us and waving their\nhats; and small boats with ladies in them waving their handkerchiefs;\nand passed the green shore of Staten Island, and caught sight of so\nmany beautiful cottages all overrun with vines, and planted on the\nbeautiful fresh mossy hill-sides; oh! then I would have given any thing\nif instead of sailing _out of_ the bay, we were only coming _into_ it;\nif we had crossed the ocean and returned, gone over and come back; and\nmy heart leaped up in me like something alive when I thought of really\nentering that bay at the end of the voyage. But that was so far\ndistant, that it seemed it could never be. No, never, never more would\nI see New York again.\nAnd what shocked me more than any thing else, was to hear some of the\nsailors, while they were at work coiling away the hawsers, talking\nabout the boarding-houses they were going to, when they came back; and\nhow that some friends of theirs had promised to be on the wharf when\nthe ship returned, to take them and their chests right up to\nFranklin-square where they lived; and how that they would have a good\ndinner ready, and plenty of cigars and spirits out on the balcony. I\nsay this kind of talking shocked me, for they did not seem to consider,\nas I did, that before any thing like that could happen, we must cross\nthe great Atlantic Ocean, cross over from America to Europe and back\nagain, many thousand miles of foaming ocean.\nAt that time I did not know what to make of these sailors; but this\nmuch I thought, that when they were boys, they could never have gone to\nthe Sunday School; for they swore so, it made my ears tingle, and used\nwords that I never could hear without a dreadful loathing.\nAnd are these the men, I thought to myself, that I must live with so\nlong? these the men I am to eat with, and sleep with all the time? And\nbesides, I now began to see, that they were not going to be very kind\nto me; but I will tell all about that when the proper time comes.\nNow you must not think, that because all these things were passing\nthrough my mind, that I had nothing to do but sit still and think; no,\nno, I was hard at work: for as long as the steamer had hold of us, we\nwere very busy coiling away ropes and cables, and putting the decks in\norder; which were littered all over with odds and ends of things that\nhad to be put away.\nAt last we got as far as the Narrows, which every body knows is the\nentrance to New York Harbor from sea; and it may well be called the\nNarrows, for when you go in or out, it seems like going in or out of a\ndoorway; and when you go out of these Narrows on a long voyage like\nthis of mine, it seems like going out into the broad highway, where not\na soul is to be seen. For far away and away, stretches the great\nAtlantic Ocean; and all you can see beyond it where the sky comes down\nto the water. It looks lonely and desolate enough, and I could hardly\nbelieve, as I gazed around me, that there could be any land beyond, or\nany place like Europe or England or Liverpool in the great wide world.\nIt seemed too strange, and wonderful, and altogether incredible, that\nthere could really be cities and towns and villages and green fields\nand hedges and farm-yards and orchards, away over that wide blank of\nsea, and away beyond the place where the sky came down to the water.\nAnd to think of steering right out among those waves, and leaving the\nbright land behind, and the dark night coming on, too, seemed wild and\nfoolhardy; and I looked with a sort of fear at the sailors standing by\nme, who could be so thoughtless at such a time. But then I remembered,\nhow many times my own father had said he had crossed the ocean; and I\nhad never dreamed of such a thing as doubting him; for I always thought\nhim a marvelous being, infinitely purer and greater than I was, who\ncould not by any possibility do wrong, or say an untruth. Yet now, how\ncould I credit it, that he, my own father, whom I so well remembered;\nhad ever sailed out of these Narrows, and sailed right through the sky\nand water line, and gone to England, and France, Liverpool, and\nMarseilles. It was too wonderful to believe.\nNow, on the right hand side of the Narrows as you go out, the land is\nquite high; and on the top of a fine cliff is a great castle or fort,\nall in ruins, and with the trees growing round it. It was built by\nGovernor Tompkins in the time of the last war with England, but was\nnever used, I believe, and so they left it to decay. I had visited the\nplace once when we lived in New York, as long ago almost as I could\nremember, with my father, and an uncle of mine, an old sea-captain,\nwith white hair, who used to sail to a place called Archangel in\nRussia, and who used to tell me that he was with Captain Langsdorff,\nwhen Captain Langsdorff crossed over by land from the sea of Okotsk in\nAsia to St. Petersburgh, drawn by large dogs in a sled. I mention this\nof my uncle, because he was the very first sea-captain I had ever seen,\nand his white hair and fine handsome florid face made so strong an\nimpression upon me, that I have never forgotten him, though I only saw\nhim during this one visit of his to New York, for he was lost in the\nWhite Sea some years after.\nBut I meant to speak about the fort. It was a beautiful place, as I\nremembered it, and very wonderful and romantic, too, as it appeared to\nme, when I went there with my uncle. On the side away from the water\nwas a green grove of trees, very thick and shady; and through this\ngrove, in a sort of twilight you came to an arch in the wall of the\nfort, dark as night; and going in, you groped about in long vaults,\ntwisting and turning on every side, till at last you caught a peep of\ngreen grass and sunlight, and all at once came out in an open space in\nthe middle of the castle. And there you would see cows quietly grazing,\nor ruminating under the shade of young trees, and perhaps a calf\nfrisking about, and trying to catch its own tail; and sheep clambering\namong the mossy ruins, and cropping the little tufts of grass sprouting\nout of the sides of the embrasures for cannon. And once I saw a black\ngoat with a long beard, and crumpled horns, standing with his forefeet\nlifted high up on the topmost parapet, and looking to sea, as if he\nwere watching for a ship that was bringing over his cousin. I can see\nhim even now, and though I have changed since then, the black goat\nlooks just the same as ever; and so I suppose he would, if I live to be\nas old as Methusaleh, and have as great a memory as he must have had.\nYes, the fort was a beautiful, quiet, charming spot. I should like to\nbuild a little cottage in the middle of it, and live there all my life.\nIt was noon-day when I was there, in the month of June, and there was\nlittle wind to stir the trees, and every thing looked as if it was\nwaiting for something, and the sky overhead was blue as my mother\u2019s\neye, and I was so glad and happy then. But I must not think of those\ndelightful days, before my father became a bankrupt, and died, and we\nremoved from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises\nup in my throat and almost strangles me.\nNow, as we sailed through the Narrows, I caught sight of that beautiful\nfort on the cliff, and could not help contrasting my situation now,\nwith what it was when with my father and uncle I went there so long\nago. Then I never thought of working for my living, and never knew that\nthere were hard hearts in the world; and knew so little of money, that\nwhen I bought a stick of candy, and laid down a sixpence, I thought the\nconfectioner returned five cents, only that I might have money to buy\nsomething else, and not because the pennies were my change, and\ntherefore mine by good rights. How different my idea of money now!\nThen I was a schoolboy, and thought of going to college in time; and\nhad vague thoughts of becoming a great orator like Patrick Henry, whose\nspeeches I used to speak on the stage; but now, I was a poor friendless\nboy, far away from my home, and voluntarily in the way of becoming a\nmiserable sailor for life. And what made it more bitter to me, was to\nthink of how well off were my cousins, who were happy and rich, and\nlived at home with my uncles and aunts, with no thought of going to sea\nfor a living. I tried to think that it was all a dream, that I was not\nwhere I was, not on board of a ship, but that I was at home again in\nthe city, with my father alive, and my mother bright and happy as she\nused to be. But it would not do. I was indeed where I was, and here was\nthe ship, and there was the fort. So, after casting a last look at some\nboys who were standing on the parapet, gazing off to sea, I turned away\nheavily, and resolved not to look at the land any more.\nAbout sunset we got fairly \u201coutside,\u201d and well may it so be called; for\nI felt thrust out of the world. Then the breeze began to blow, and the\nsails were loosed, and hoisted; and after a while, the steamboat left\nus, and for the first time I felt the ship roll, a strange feeling\nenough, as if it were a great barrel in the water. Shortly after, I\nobserved a swift little schooner running across our bows, and\nre-crossing again and again; and while I was wondering what she could\nbe, she suddenly lowered her sails, and two men took hold of a little\nboat on her deck, and launched it overboard as if it had been a chip.\nThen I noticed that our pilot, a red-faced man in a rough blue coat,\nwho to my astonishment had all this time been giving orders instead of\nthe captain, began to button up his coat to the throat, like a prudent\nperson about leaving a house at night in a lonely square, to go home;\nand he left the giving orders to the chief mate, and stood apart\ntalking with the captain, and put his hand into his pocket, and gave\nhim some newspapers.\nAnd in a few minutes, when we had stopped our headway, and allowed the\nlittle boat to come alongside, he shook hands with the captain and\nofficers and bade them good-by, without saying a syllable of farewell\nto me and the sailors; and so he went laughing over the side, and got\ninto the boat, and they pulled him off to the schooner, and then the\nschooner made sail and glided under our stern, her men standing up and\nwaving their hats, and cheering; and that was the last we saw of\nAmerica.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nHE IS PUT INTO THE LARBOARD WATCH; GETS SEA-SICK; AND RELATES SOME\nOTHER OF HIS EXPERIENCES\nIt was now getting dark, when all at once the sailors were ordered on\nthe quarter-deck, and of course I went along with them.\nWhat is to come now, thought I; but I soon found out. It seemed we were\ngoing to be divided into watches. The chief mate began by selecting a\nstout good-looking sailor for his watch; and then the second mate\u2019s\nturn came to choose, and he also chose a stout good-looking sailor. But\nit was not me;\u2014 no; and _I_ noticed, as they went on choosing, one\nafter the other in regular rotation, that both of the mates never so\nmuch as looked at me, but kept going round among the rest, peering into\ntheir faces, for it was dusk, and telling them not to hide themselves\naway so in their jackets. But the sailors, especially the stout\ngood-looking ones, seemed to make a point of lounging as much out of\nthe way as possible, and slouching their hats over their eyes; and\nalthough it may only be a fancy of mine, _I_ certainly thought that\nthey affected a sort of lordly indifference as to whose watch they were\ngoing to be in; and did not think it worth while to look any way\nanxious about the matter. And the very men who, a few minutes before,\nhad showed the most alacrity and promptitude in jumping into the\nrigging and running aloft at the word of command, now lounged against\nthe bulwarks and most lazily; as if they were quite sure, that by this\ntime the officers must know who the best men were, and they valued\nthemselves well enough to be willing to put the officers to the trouble\nof searching them out; for if they were worth having, they were worth\nseeking.\nAt last they were all chosen but me; and it was the chief mate\u2019s next\nturn to choose; though there could be little choosing in my case, since\n_I_ was a thirteener, and must, whether or no, go over to the next\ncolumn, like the odd figure you carry along when you do a sum in\naddition.\n\u201cWell, Buttons,\u201d said the chief mate, \u201cI thought I\u2019d got rid of you.\nAnd as it is, Mr. Rigs,\u201d he added, speaking to the second mate, \u201cI\nguess you had better take him into your watch;\u2014there, I\u2019ll let you have\nhim, and then you\u2019ll be one stronger than me.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I thank you,\u201d said Mr. Rigs.\n\u201cYou had better,\u201d said the chief mate\u2014\u201csee, he\u2019s not a bad looking\nchap\u2014he\u2019s a little green, to be sure, but you were so once yourself,\nyou know, Rigs.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I thank you,\u201d said the second mate again. \u201cTake him yourself\u2014he\u2019s\nyours by good rights\u2014I don\u2019t want him.\u201d And so they put me in the chief\nmate\u2019s division, that is the larboard watch.\nWhile this scene was going on, I felt shabby enough; there I stood,\njust like a silly sheep, over whom two butchers are bargaining. Nothing\nthat had yet happened so forcibly reminded me of where I was, and what\nI had come to. I was very glad when they sent us forward again.\nAs we were going forward, the second mate called one of the sailors by\nname:-\u201cYou, Bill?\u201d and Bill answered, \u201cSir?\u201d just as if the second mate\nwas a born gentleman. It surprised me not a little, to see a man in\nsuch a shabby, shaggy old jacket addressed so respectfully; but I had\nbeen quite as much surprised when I heard the chief mate call him _Mr._\nRigs during the scene on the quarter-deck; as if this _Mr. Rigs_ was a\ngreat merchant living in a marble house in Lafayette Place. But I was\nnot very long in finding out, that at sea all officers are _Misters,_\nand would take it for an insult if any seaman presumed to omit calling\nthem so. And it is also one of their rights and privileges to be called\n_sir_ when addressed\u2014Yes, _sir; No, sir; Ay, ay, sir;_ and they are as\nparticular about being sirred as so many knights and baronets; though\ntheir titles are not hereditary, as is the case with the Sir Johns and\nSir Joshuas in England. But so far as the second mate is concerned, his\ntides are the only dignities he enjoys; for, upon the whole, he leads a\npuppyish life indeed. He is not deemed company at any time for the\ncaptain, though the chief mate occasionally is, at least deck-company,\nthough not in the cabin; and besides this, the second mate has to\nbreakfast, lunch, dine, and sup off the leavings of the cabin table,\nand even the steward, who is accountable to nobody but the captain,\nsometimes treats him cavalierly; and he has to run aloft when topsails\nare reefed; and put his hand a good way down into the tar-bucket; and\nkeep the key of the boatswain\u2019s locker, and fetch and carry balls of\nmarline and seizing-stuff for the sailors when at work in the rigging;\nbesides doing many other things, which a true-born baronet of any\nspirit would rather die and give up his title than stand.\nHaving been divided into watches we were sent to supper; but I could\nnot eat any thing except a little biscuit, though I should have liked\nto have some good tea; but as I had no pot to get it in, and was rather\nnervous about asking the rough sailors to let me drink out of theirs; I\nwas obliged to go without a sip. I thought of going to the black cook\nand begging a tin cup; but he looked so cross and ugly then, that the\nsight of him almost frightened the idea out of me.\nWhen supper was over, for they never talk about going to _tea_ aboard\nof a ship, the watch to which I belonged was called on deck; and we\nwere told it was for us to stand the first night watch, that is, from\neight o\u2019clock till midnight.\nI now began to feel unsettled and ill at ease about the stomach, as if\nmatters were all topsy-turvy there; and felt strange and giddy about\nthe head; and so I made no doubt that this was the beginning of that\ndreadful thing, the sea-sickness. Feeling worse and worse, I told one\nof the sailors how it was with me, and begged him to make my excuses\nvery civilly to the chief mate, for I thought I would go below and\nspend the night in my bunk. But he only laughed at me, and said\nsomething about my mother not being aware of my being out; which\nenraged me not a little, that a man whom I had heard swear so terribly,\nshould dare to take such a holy name into his mouth. It seemed a sort\nof blasphemy, and it seemed like dragging out the best and most\ncherished secrets of my soul, for at that time the name of mother was\nthe center of all my heart\u2019s finest feelings, which ere that, I had\nlearned to keep secret, deep down in my being.\nBut I did not outwardly resent the sailor\u2019s words, for that would have\nonly made the matter worse.\nNow this man was a Greenlander by birth, with a very white skin where\nthe sun had not burnt it, and handsome blue eyes placed wide apart in\nhis head, and a broad good-humored face, and plenty of curly flaxen\nhair. He was not very tall, but exceedingly stout-built, though active;\nand his back was as broad as a shield, and it was a great way between\nhis shoulders. He seemed to be a sort of lady\u2019s sailor, for in his\nbroken English he was always talking about the nice ladies of his\nacquaintance in Stockholm and Copenhagen and a place he called the\nHook, which at first I fancied must be the place where lived the\nhook-nosed men that caught fowling-pieces and every other article that\ncame along. He was dressed very tastefully, too, as if he knew he was a\ngood-looking fellow. He had on a new blue woolen Havre frock, with a\nnew silk handkerchief round his neck, passed through one of the\nvertebral bones of a shark, highly polished and carved. His trowsers\nwere of clear white duck, and he sported a handsome pair of pumps, and\na tarpaulin hat bright as a looking-glass, with a long black ribbon\nstreaming behind, and getting entangled every now and then in the\nrigging; and he had gold anchors in his ears, and a silver ring on one\nof his fingers, which was very much worn and bent from pulling ropes\nand other work on board ship. I thought he might better have left his\njewelry at home.\nIt was a long time before I could believe that this man was really from\nGreenland, though he looked strange enough to me, then, to have come\nfrom the moon; and he was full of stories about that distant country;\nhow they passed the winters there; and how bitter cold it was; and how\nhe used to go to bed and sleep twelve hours, and get up again and run\nabout, and go to bed again, and get up again\u2014there was no telling how\nmany times, and all in one night; for in the winter time in his\ncountry, he said, the nights were so many weeks long, that a Greenland\nbaby was sometimes three months old, before it could properly be said\nto be a day old.\nI had seen mention made of such things before, in books of voyages; but\nthat was only reading about them, just as you read the Arabian Nights,\nwhich no one ever believes; for somehow, when I read about these\nwonderful countries, I never used really to believe what I read, but\nonly thought it very strange, and a good deal too strange to be\naltogether true; though I never thought the men who wrote the book\nmeant to tell lies. But I don\u2019t know exactly how to explain what I\nmean; but this much I will say, that I never believed in Greenland till\nI saw this Greenlander. And at first, hearing him talk about Greenland,\nonly made me still more incredulous. For what business had a man from\nGreenland to be in my company? Why was he not at home among the\nicebergs, and how could he stand a warm summer\u2019s sun, and not be melted\naway? Besides, instead of icicles, there were ear-rings hanging from\nhis ears; and he did not wear bear-skins, and keep his hands in a huge\nmuff; things, which I could not help connecting with Greenland and all\nGreenlanders.\nBut I was telling about my being sea-sick and wanting to retire for the\nnight. This Greenlander seeing I was ill, volunteered to turn doctor\nand cure me; so going down into the forecastle, he came back with a\nbrown jug, like a molasses jug, and a little tin cannikin, and as soon\nas the brown jug got near my nose, I needed no telling what was in it,\nfor it smelt like a still-house, and sure enough proved to be full of\nJamaica spirits.\n\u201cNow, Buttons,\u201d said he, \u201cone little dose of this will be better for\nyou than a whole night\u2019s sleep; there, take that now, and then eat\nseven or eight biscuits, and you\u2019ll feel as strong as the mainmast.\u201d\nBut I felt very little like doing as I was bid, for I had some scruples\nabout drinking spirits; and to tell the plain truth, for I am not\nashamed of it, I was a member of a society in the village where my\nmother lived, called the Juvenile Total Abstinence Association, of\nwhich my friend, Tom Legare, was president, secretary, and treasurer,\nand kept the funds in a little purse that his cousin knit for him.\nThere was three and sixpence on hand, I believe, the last time he\nbrought in his accounts, on a May day, when we had a meeting in a grove\non the river-bank. Tom was a very honest treasurer, and never spent the\nSociety\u2019s money for peanuts; and besides all, was a fine, generous boy,\nwhom I much loved. But I must not talk about Tom now.\nWhen the Greenlander came to me with his jug of medicine, I thanked him\nas well as I could; for just then I was leaning with my mouth over the\nside, feeling ready to die; but I managed to tell him I was under a\nsolemn obligation never to drink spirits upon any consideration\nwhatever; though, as I had a sort of presentiment that the spirits\nwould now, for once in my life, do me good, I began to feel sorry, that\nwhen I signed the pledge of abstinence, I had not taken care to insert\na little clause, allowing me to drink spirits in case of sea-sickness.\nAnd I would advise temperance people to attend to this matter in\nfuture; and then if they come to go to sea, there will be no need of\nbreaking their pledges, which I am truly sorry to say was the case with\nme. And a hard thing it was, too, thus to break a vow before unbroken;\nespecially as the Jamaica tasted any thing but agreeable, and indeed\nburnt my mouth so, that I did not relish my meals for some time after.\nEven when I had become quite well and strong again, I wondered how the\nsailors could really like such stuff; but many of them had a jug of it,\nbesides the Greenlander, which they brought along to sea with them, _to\ntaper off with,_ as they called it. But this tapering off did not last\nvery long, for the Jamaica was all gone on the second day, and the jugs\nwere tossed overboard. I wonder where they are now?\nBut to tell the truth, I found, in spite of its sharp taste, the\nspirits I drank was just the thing I needed; but I suppose, if I could\nhave had a cup of nice hot coffee, it would have done quite as well,\nand perhaps much better. But that was not to be had at that time of\nnight, or, indeed, at any other time; for the thing they called\n_coffee,_ which was given to us every morning at breakfast, was the\nmost curious tasting drink I ever drank, and tasted as little like\ncoffee, as it did like lemonade; though, to be sure, it was generally\nas cold as lemonade, and I used to think the cook had an icehouse, and\ndropt ice into his coffee. But what was more curious still, was the\ndifferent quality and taste of it on different mornings. Sometimes it\ntasted fishy, as if it was a decoction of Dutch herrings; and then it\nwould taste very salty, as if some _old horse,_ or sea-beef, had been\nboiled in it; and then again it would taste a sort of cheesy, as if the\ncaptain had sent his cheese-parings forward to make our coffee of; and\nyet another time it would have such a very bad flavor, that I was\nalmost ready to think some old stocking-heels had been boiled in it.\nWhat under heaven it was made of, that it had so many different bad\nflavors, always remained a mystery; for when at work at his vocation,\nour old cook used to keep himself close shut-up in his caboose, a\nlittle cook-house, and never told any of his secrets.\nThough a very serious character, as I shall hereafter show, he was for\nall that, and perhaps for that identical reason, a very suspicious\nlooking sort of a cook, that I don\u2019t believe would ever succeed in\ngetting the cooking at Delmonico\u2019s in New York. It was well for him\nthat he was a black cook, for I have no doubt his color kept us from\nseeing his dirty face! I never saw him wash but once, and that was at\none of his own soup pots one dark night when he thought no one saw him.\nWhat induced him to be washing his face then, I never could find out;\nbut I suppose he must have suddenly waked up, after dreaming about some\nreal estate on his cheeks. As for his coffee, notwithstanding the\ndisagreeableness of its flavor, I always used to have a strange\ncuriosity every morning, to see what new taste it was going to have;\nand though, sure enough, I never missed making a new discovery, and\nadding another taste to my palate, I never found that there was any\nchange in the badness of the beverage, which always seemed the same in\nthat respect as before.\nIt may well be believed, then, that now when I was seasick, a cup of\nsuch coffee as our old cook made would have done me no good, if indeed\nit would not have come near making an end of me. And bad as it was, and\nsince it was not to be had at that time of night, as I said before, I\nthink I was excusable in taking something else in place of it, as I\ndid; and under the circumstances, it would be unhandsome of them, if my\nfellow-members of the Temperance Society should reproach me for\nbreaking my bond, which I would not have done except in case of\nnecessity. But the evil effect of breaking one\u2019s bond upon any occasion\nwhatever, was witnessed in the present case; for it insidiously opened\nthe way to subsequent breaches of it, which though very slight, yet\ncarried no apology with them.\nCHAPTER IX.\nTHE SAILORS BECOMING A LITTLE SOCIAL, REDBURN CONVERSES WITH THEM\nThe latter part of this first long watch that we stood was very\npleasant, so far as the weather was concerned. From being rather\ncloudy, it became a soft moonlight; and the stars peeped out, plain\nenough to count one by one; and there was a fine steady breeze; and it\nwas not very cold; and we were going through the water almost as smooth\nas a sled sliding down hill. And what was still better, the wind held\nso steady, that there was little running aloft, little pulling ropes,\nand scarcely any thing disagreeable of that kind.\nThe chief mate kept walking up and down the quarter-deck, with a\nlighted long-nine cigar in his mouth by way of a torch; and spoke but\nfew words to us the whole watch. He must have had a good deal of\nthinking to attend to, which in truth is the case with most seamen the\nfirst night out of port, especially when they have thrown away their\nmoney in foolish dissipation, and got very sick into the bargain. For\nwhen ashore, many of these sea-officers are as wild and reckless in\ntheir way, as the sailors they command.\nWhile I stood watching the red cigar-end promenading up and down, the\nmate suddenly stopped and gave an order, and the men sprang to obey it.\nIt was not much, only something about hoisting one of the sails a\nlittle higher up on the mast. The men took hold of the rope, and began\npulling upon it; the foremost man of all setting up a song with no\nwords to it, only a strange musical rise and fall of notes. In the dark\nnight, and far out upon the lonely sea, it sounded wild enough, and\nmade me feel as I had sometimes felt, when in a twilight room a cousin\nof mine, with black eyes, used to play some old German airs on the\npiano. I almost looked round for goblins, and felt just a little bit\nafraid. But I soon got used to this singing; for the sailors never\ntouched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one happened to strike\nup, and the pulling, whatever it might be, did not seem to be getting\nforward very well, the mate would always say, _\u201cCome, men, can\u2019t any of\nyou sing? Sing now, and raise the dead.\u201d_ And then some one of them\nwould begin, and if every man\u2019s arms were as much relieved as mine by\nthe song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a\ncheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath\nexpended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing\nwell, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal\nof popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a\nman, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope.\nDuring the greater part of the watch, the sailors sat on the windlass\nand told long stories of their adventures by sea and land, and talked\nabout Gibraltar, and Canton, and Valparaiso, and Bombay, just as you\nand I would about Peck Slip and the Bowery. Every man of them almost\nwas a volume of Voyages and Travels round the World. And what most\nstruck me was that like books of voyages they often contradicted each\nother, and would fall into long and violent disputes about who was\nkeeping the Foul Anchor tavern in Portsmouth at such a time; or whether\nthe King of Canton lived or did not live in Persia; or whether the\nbar-maid of a particular house in Hamburg had black eyes or blue eyes;\nwith many other mooted points of that sort.\nAt last one of them went below and brought up a box of cigars from his\nchest, for some sailors always provide little delicacies of that kind,\nto break off the first shock of the salt water after laying idle\nashore; and also by way of _tapering off,_ as I mentioned a little\nwhile ago. But I wondered that they never carried any pies and tarts to\nsea with them, instead of spirits and cigars.\nNed, for that was the man\u2019s name, split open the box with a blow of his\nfist, and then handed it round along the windlass, just like a waiter\nat a party, every one helping himself. But I was a member of an\nAnti-Smoking Society that had been organized in our village by the\nPrincipal of the Sunday School there, in conjunction with the\nTemperance Association. So I did not smoke any then, though I did\nafterward upon the voyage, I am sorry to say. Notwithstanding I\ndeclined; with a good deal of unnecessary swearing, Ned assured me that\nthe cigars were real genuine Havannas; for he had been in Havanna, he\nsaid, and had them made there under his own eye. According to his\naccount, he was very particular about his cigars and other things, and\nnever made any importations, for they were unsafe; but always made a\nvoyage himself direct to the place where any foreign thing was to be\nhad that he wanted. He went to Havre for his woolen shirts, to Panama\nfor his hats, to China for his silk handkerchiefs, and direct to\nCalcutta for his cheroots; and as a great joker in the watch used to\nsay, no doubt he would at last have occasion to go to Russia for his\nhalter; the wit of which saying was presumed to be in the fact, that\nthe Russian hemp is the best; though that is not wit which needs\nexplaining.\nBy dint of the spirits which, besides stimulating my fainting strength,\nunited with the cool air of the sea to give me an appetite for our hard\nbiscuit; and also by dint of walking briskly up and down the deck\nbefore the windlass, I had now recovered in good part from my sickness,\nand finding the sailors all very pleasant and sociable, at least among\nthemselves, and seated smoking together like old cronies, and nothing\non earth to do but sit the watch out, I began to think that they were a\npretty good set of fellows after all, barring their swearing and\nanother ugly way of talking they had; and I thought I had misconceived\ntheir true characters; for at the outset I had deemed them such a\nparcel of wicked hard-hearted rascals that it would be a severe\naffliction to associate with them.\nYes, I now began to look on them with a sort of incipient love; but\nmore with an eye of pity and compassion, as men of naturally gentle and\nkind dispositions, whom only hardships, and neglect, and ill-usage had\nmade outcasts from good society; and not as villains who loved\nwickedness for the sake of it, and would persist in wickedness, even in\nParadise, if they ever got there. And I called to mind a sermon I had\nonce heard in a church in behalf of sailors, when the preacher called\nthem strayed lambs from the fold, and compared them to poor lost\nchildren, babes in the wood, orphans without fathers or mothers.\nAnd I remembered reading in a magazine, called the Sailors\u2019 Magazine,\nwith a sea-blue cover, and a ship painted on the back, about pious\nseamen who never swore, and paid over all their wages to the poor\nheathen in India; and how that when they were too old to go to sea,\nthese pious old sailors found a delightful home for life in the\nHospital, where they had nothing to do, but prepare themselves for\ntheir latter end. And I wondered whether there were any such good\nsailors among my ship-mates; and observing that one of them laid on\ndeck apart from the rest, I thought to be sure he must be one of them:\nso I did not disturb his devotions: but I was afterward shocked at\ndiscovering that he was only fast asleep, with one of the brown jugs by\nhis side.\nI forgot to mention by the way, that every once in a while, the men\nwent into one corner, where the chief mate could not see them, to take\na \u201cswig at the halyards,\u201d as they called it; and this swigging at the\nhalyards it was, that enabled them \u201cto taper off\u201d handsomely, and no\ndoubt it was this, too, that had something to do with making them so\npleasant and sociable that night, for they were seldom so pleasant and\nsociable afterward, and never treated me so kindly as they did then.\nYet this might have been owing to my being something of a stranger to\nthem, then; and our being just out of port. But that very night they\nturned about, and taught me a bitter lesson; but all in good time.\nI have said, that seeing how agreeable they were getting, and how\nfriendly their manner was, I began to feel a sort of compassion for\nthem, grounded on their sad conditions as amiable outcasts; and feeling\nso warm an interest in them, and being full of pity, and being truly\ndesirous of benefiting them to the best of my poor powers, for I knew\nthey were but poor indeed, I made bold to ask one of them, whether he\nwas ever in the habit of going to church, when he was ashore, or\ndropping in at the Floating Chapel I had seen lying off the dock in the\nEast River at New York; and whether he would think it too much of a\nliberty, if I asked him, if he had any good books in his chest. He\nstared a little at first, but marking what good language I used, seeing\nmy civil bearing toward him, he seemed for a moment to be filled with a\ncertain involuntary respect for me, and answered, that he had been to\nchurch once, some ten or twelve years before, in London, and on a\nweek-day had helped to move the Floating Chapel round the Battery, from\nthe North River; and that was the only time he had seen it. For his\nbooks, he said he did not know what I meant by good books; but if I\nwanted the Newgate Calendar, and Pirate\u2019s Own, he could lend them to\nme.\nWhen I heard this poor sailor talk in this manner, showing so plainly\nhis ignorance and absence of proper views of religion, I pitied him\nmore and more, and contrasting my own situation with his, I was\ngrateful that I was different from him; and I thought how pleasant it\nwas, to feel wiser and better than he could feel; though I was willing\nto confess to myself, that it was not altogether my own good endeavors,\nso much as my education, which I had received from others, that had\nmade me the upright and sensible boy I at that time thought myself to\nbe. And it was now, that I began to feel a good degree of complacency\nand satisfaction in surveying my own character; for, before this, I had\npreviously associated with persons of a very discreet life, so that\nthere was little opportunity to magnify myself, by comparing myself\nwith my neighbors.\nThinking that my superiority to him in a moral way might sit uneasily\nupon this sailor, I thought it would soften the matter down by giving\nhim a chance to show his own superiority to me, in a minor thing; for I\nwas far from being vain and conceited.\nHaving observed that at certain intervals a little bell was rung on the\nquarter-deck by the man at the wheel; and that as soon as it was heard,\nsome one of the sailors forward struck a large bell which hung on the\nforecastle; and having observed that how many times soever the man\nastern rang his bell, the man forward struck his\u2014tit for tat,\u2014I\ninquired of this Floating Chapel sailor, what all this ringing meant;\nand whether, as the big bell hung right over the scuttle that went down\nto the place where the watch below were sleeping, such a ringing every\nlittle while would not tend to disturb them and beget unpleasant\ndreams; and in asking these questions I was particular to address him\nin a civil and condescending way, so as to show him very plainly that I\ndid not deem myself one whit better than he was, that is, taking all\nthings together, and not going into particulars. But to my great\nsurprise and mortification, he in the rudest land of manner laughed\naloud in my face, and called me a \u201cJimmy Dux,\u201d though that was not my\nreal name, and he must have known it; and also the \u201cson of a farmer,\u201d\nthough as I have previously related, my father was a great merchant and\nFrench importer in Broad-street in New York. And then he began to laugh\nand joke about me, with the other sailors, till they all got round me,\nand if I had not felt so terribly angry, I should certainly have felt\nvery much like a fool. But my being so angry prevented me from feeling\nfoolish, which is very lucky for people in a passion.\nCHAPTER X.\nHE IS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED; THE SAILORS ABUSE HIM; AND HE BECOMES\nMISERABLE AND FORLORN\nWhile the scene last described was going on, we were all startled by a\nhorrid groaning noise down in the forecastle; and all at once some one\ncame rushing up the scuttle in his shirt, clutching something in his\nhand, and trembling and shrieking in the most frightful manner, so that\nI thought one of the sailors must be murdered below.\nBut it all passed in a moment; and while we stood aghast at the sight,\nand almost before we knew what it was, the shrieking man jumped over\nthe bows into the sea, and we saw him no more. Then there was a great\nuproar; the sailors came running up on deck; and the chief mate ran\nforward, and learning what had happened, began to yell out his orders\nabout the sails and yards; and we all went to pulling and hauling the\nropes, till at last the ship lay almost still on the water. Then they\nloosed a boat, which kept pulling round the ship for more than an hour,\nbut they never caught sight of the man. It seemed that he was one of\nthe sailors who had been brought aboard dead drunk, and tumbled into\nhis bunk by his landlord; and there he had lain till now. He must have\nsuddenly waked up, I suppose, raging mad with the delirium tremens, as\nthe chief mate called it, and finding himself in a strange silent\nplace, and knowing not how he had got there, he rushed on deck, and so,\nin a fit of frenzy, put an end to himself.\nThis event, happening at the dead of night, had a wonderfully solemn\nand almost awful effect upon me. I would have given the whole world,\nand the sun and moon, and all the stars in heaven, if they had been\nmine, had I been safe back at Mr. Jones\u2019, or still better, in my home\non the Hudson River. I thought it an ill-omened voyage, and railed at\nthe folly which had sent me to sea, sore against the advice of my best\nfriends, that is to say, my mother and sisters.\nAlas! poor Wellingborough, thought I, you will never see your home any\nmore. And in this melancholy mood I went below, when the watch had\nexpired, which happened soon after. But to my terror, I found that the\nsuicide had been occupying the very bunk which I had appropriated to\nmyself, and there was no other place for me to sleep in. The thought of\nlying down there now, seemed too horrible to me, and what made it\nworse, was the way in which the sailors spoke of my being frightened.\nAnd they took this opportunity to tell me what a hard and wicked life I\nhad entered upon, and how that such things happened frequently at sea,\nand they were used to it. But I did not believe this; for when the\nsuicide came rushing and shrieking up the scuttle, they looked as\nfrightened as I did; and besides that, and what makes their being\nfrightened still plainer, is the fact, that if they had had any\npresence of mind, they could have prevented his plunging overboard,\nsince he brushed right by them. However, they lay in their bunks\nsmoking, and kept talking on some time in this strain, and advising me\nas soon as ever I got home to pin my ears back, so as not to hold the\nwind, and sail straight away into the interior of the country, and\nnever stop until deep in the bush, far off from the least running\nbrook, never mind how shallow, and out of sight of even the smallest\npuddle of rainwater.\nThis kind of talking brought the tears into my eyes, for it was so true\nand real, and the sailors who spoke it seemed so false-hearted and\ninsincere; but for all that, in spite of the sickness at my heart, it\nmade me mad, and stung me to the quick, that they should speak of me as\na poor trembling coward, who could never be brought to endure the\nhardships of a sailor\u2019s life; for I felt myself trembling, and knew\nthat I was but a coward then, well enough, without their telling me of\nit. And they did not say I was cowardly, because they perceived it in\nme, but because they merely supposed I must be, judging, no doubt, from\ntheir own secret thoughts about themselves; for I felt sure that the\nsuicide frightened them very badly. And at last, being provoked to\ndesperation by their taunts, I told them so to their faces; but I might\nbetter have kept silent; for they now all united to abuse me. They\nasked me what business I, a boy like me, had to go to sea, and take the\nbread out of the mouth of honest sailors, and fill a good seaman\u2019s\nplace; and asked me whether I ever dreamed of becoming a captain, since\nI was a gentleman with white hands; and if I ever _should_ be, they\nwould like nothing better than to ship aboard my vessel and stir up a\nmutiny. And one of them, whose name was Jackson, of whom I shall have a\ngood deal more to say by-and-by, said, I had better steer clear of him\never after, for if ever I crossed his path, or got into his way, he\nwould be the death of me, and if ever I stumbled about in the rigging\nnear _him,_ he would make nothing of pitching me overboard; and that he\nswore too, with an oath. At first, all this nearly stunned me, it was\nso unforeseen; and then I could not believe that they meant what they\nsaid, or that they could be so cruel and black-hearted. But how could I\nhelp seeing, that the men who could thus talk to a poor, friendless\nboy, on the very first night of his voyage to sea, must be capable of\nalmost any enormity. I loathed, detested, and hated them with all that\nwas left of my bursting heart and soul, and I thought myself the most\nforlorn and miserable wretch that ever breathed. May I never be a man,\nthought I, if to be a boy is to be such a wretch. And I wailed and\nwept, and my heart cracked within me, but all the time I defied them\nthrough my teeth, and dared them to do their worst.\nAt last they ceased talking and fell fast asleep, leaving me awake,\nseated on a chest with my face bent over my knees between my hands. And\nthere I sat, till at length the dull beating against the ship\u2019s bows,\nand the silence around soothed me down, and I fell asleep as I sat.\nCHAPTER XI.\nHE HELPS WASH THE DECKS, AND THEN GOES TO BREAKFAST\nThe next thing I knew, was the loud thumping of a handspike on deck as\nthe watch was called again. It was now four o\u2019clock in the morning, and\nwhen we got on deck the first signs of day were shining in the east.\nThe men were very sleepy, and sat down on the windlass without\nspeaking, and some of them nodded and nodded, till at last they fell\noff like little boys in church during a drowsy sermon. At last it was\nbroad day, and an order was given to wash down the decks. A great tub\nwas dragged into the waist, and then one of the men went over into the\nchains, and slipped in behind a band fastened to the shrouds, and\nleaning over, began to swing a bucket into the sea by a long rope; and\nin that way with much expertness and sleight of hand, he managed to\nfill the tub in a very short time. Then the water began to splash about\nall over the decks, and I began to think I should surely get my feet\nwet, and catch my death of cold. So I went to the chief mate, and told\nhim I thought I would just step below, till this miserable wetting was\nover; for I did not have any water-proof boots, and an aunt of mine had\ndied of consumption. But he only roared out for me to get a broom and\ngo to scrubbing, or he would prove a worse consumption to me than ever\ngot hold of my poor aunt. So I scrubbed away fore and aft, till my back\nwas almost broke, for the brooms had uncommon short handles, and we\nwere told to scrub hard.\nAt length the scrubbing being over, the mate began heaving buckets of\nwater about, to wash every thing clean, by way of finishing off. He\nmust have thought this fine sport, just as captains of fire engines\nlove to point the tube of their hose; for he kept me running after him\nwith full buckets of water, and sometimes chased a little chip all over\nthe deck, with a continued flood, till at last he sent it flying out of\na scupper-hole into the sea; when if he had only given me permission, I\ncould have picked it up in a trice, and dropped it overboard without\nsaying one word, and without wasting so much water. But he said there\nwas plenty of water in the ocean, and to spare; which was true enough,\nbut then I who had to trot after him with the buckets, had no more legs\nand arms than I wanted for my own use.\nI thought this washing down the decks was the most foolish thing in the\nworld, and besides that it was the most uncomfortable. It was worse\nthan my mother\u2019s house-cleanings at home, which I used to abominate so.\nAt eight o\u2019clock the bell was struck, and we went to breakfast. And now\nsome of the worst of my troubles began. For not having had any friend\nto tell me what I would want at sea, I had not provided myself, as I\nshould have done, with a good many things that a sailor needs; and for\nmy own part, it had never entered my mind, that sailors had no table to\nsit down to, no cloth, or napkins, or tumblers, and had to provide\nevery thing themselves. But so it was.\nThe first thing they did was this. Every sailor went to the cook-house\nwith his tin pot, and got it filled with coffee; but of course, having\nno pot, there was no coffee for me. And after that, a sort of little\ntub called a \u201ckid,\u201d was passed down into the forecastle, filled with\nsomething they called \u201cburgoo.\u201d This was like mush, made of Indian\ncorn, meal, and water. With the _\u201ckid,\u201d a_ little tin cannikin was\npassed down with molasses. Then the Jackson that I spoke of before, put\nthe kid between his knees, and began to pour in the molasses, just like\nan old landlord mixing punch for a party. He scooped out a little hole\nin the middle of the mush, to hold the molasses; so it looked for all\nthe world like a little black pool in the Dismal Swamp of Virginia.\nThen they all formed a circle round the kid; and one after the other,\nwith great regularity, dipped their spoons into the mush, and after\nstirring them round a little in the molasses-pool, they swallowed down\ntheir mouthfuls, and smacked their lips over it, as if it tasted very\ngood; which I have no doubt it did; but not having any spoon, I wasn\u2019t\nsure.\nI sat some time watching these proceedings, and wondering how polite\nthey were to each other; for, though there were a great many spoons to\nonly one dish, they never got entangled. At last, seeing that the mush\nwas getting thinner and thinner, and that it was getting low water, or\nrather low molasses in the little pool, I ran on deck, and after\nsearching about, returned with a bit of stick; and thinking I had as\ngood a right as any one else to the mush and molasses, I worked my way\ninto the circle, intending to make one of the party. So I shoved in my\nstick, and after twirling it about, was just managing to carry a little\n_burgoo_ toward my mouth, which had been for some time standing ready\nopen to receive it, when one of the sailors perceiving what I was\nabout, knocked the stick out of my hands, and asked me where I learned\nmy manners; Was that the way gentlemen eat in my country? Did they eat\ntheir victuals with splinters of wood, and couldn\u2019t that wealthy\ngentleman my father afford to buy his gentlemanly son a spoon?\nAll the rest joined in, and pronounced me an ill-bred, coarse, and\nunmannerly youngster, who, if permitted to go on with such behavior as\nthat, would corrupt the whole crew, and make them no better than swine.\nAs I felt conscious that a stick was indeed a thing very unsuitable to\neat with, I did not say much to this, though it vexed me enough; but\nremembering that I had seen one of the steerage passengers with a pan\nand spoon in his hand eating his breakfast on the fore hatch, I now ran\non deck again, and to my great joy succeeded in borrowing his spoon,\nfor he had got through his meal, and down I came again, though at the\neleventh hour, and offered myself once more as a candidate.\nBut alas! there was little more of the Dismal Swamp left, and when I\nreached over to the opposite end of the kid, I received a rap on the\nknuckles from a spoon, and was told that I must help myself from my own\nside, for that was the rule. But _my_ side was scraped clean, so I got\nno _burgoo_ that morning.\nBut I made it up by eating some salt beef and biscuit, which I found to\nbe the invariable accompaniment of every meal; the sailors sitting\ncross-legged on their chests in a circle, and breaking the hard\nbiscuit, very sociably, over each other\u2019s heads, which was very\nconvenient indeed, but gave me the headache, at least for the first\nfour or five days till I got used to it; and then I did not care much\nabout it, only it kept my hair full of crumbs; and I had forgot to\nbring a fine comb and brush, so I used to shake my hair out to windward\nover the bulwarks every evening.\nCHAPTER XII.\nHE GIVES SOME ACCOUNT OF ONE OF HIS SHIPMATES CALLED JACKSON\nWhile we sat eating our beef and biscuit, two of the men got into a\ndispute, about who had been sea-faring the longest; when Jackson, who\nhad mixed the _burgoo,_ called upon them in a loud voice to cease their\nclamor, for he would decide the matter for them. Of this sailor, I\nshall have something more to say, as I get on with my narrative; so, I\nwill here try to describe him a little.\nDid you ever see a man, with his hair shaved off, and just recovered\nfrom the yellow fever? Well, just such a looking man was this sailor.\nHe was as yellow as gamboge, had no more whisker on his cheek, than I\nhave on my elbows. His hair had fallen out, and left him very bald,\nexcept in the nape of his neck, and just behind the ears, where it was\nstuck over with short little tufts, and looked like a worn-out\nshoe-brush. His nose had broken down in the middle, and he squinted\nwith one eye, and did not look very straight out of the other. He\ndressed a good deal like a Bowery boy; for he despised the ordinary\nsailor-rig; wearing a pair of great over-all blue trowsers, fastened\nwith suspenders, and three red woolen shirts, one over the other; for\nhe was subject to the rheumatism, and was not in good health, he said;\nand he had a large white wool hat, with a broad rolling brim. He was a\nnative of New York city, and had a good deal to say about\n_highlanders,_ and _rowdies,_ whom he denounced as only good for the\ngallows; but I thought he looked a good deal like a _highlander_\nhimself.\nHis name, as I have said, was Jackson; and he told us, he was a near\nrelation of General Jackson of New Orleans, and swore terribly, if any\none ventured to question what he asserted on that head. In fact he was\na great bully, and being the best seaman on board, and very overbearing\nevery way, all the men were afraid of him, and durst not contradict\nhim, or cross his path in any thing. And what made this more wonderful\nwas, that he was the weakest man, bodily, of the whole crew; and I have\nno doubt that young and small as I was then, compared to what I am now,\nI could have thrown him down. But he had such an overawing way with\nhim; such a deal of brass and impudence, such an unflinching face, and\nwithal was such a hideous looking mortal, that Satan himself would have\nrun from him. And besides all this, it was quite plain, that he was by\nnature a marvelously clever, cunning man, though without education; and\nunderstood human nature to a kink, and well knew whom he had to deal\nwith; and then, one glance of his squinting eye, was as good as a\nknock-down, for it was the most deep, subtle, infernal looking eye,\nthat I ever saw lodged in a human head. I believe, that by good rights\nit must have belonged to a wolf, or starved tiger; at any rate, I would\ndefy any oculist, to turn out a glass eye, half so cold, and snaky, and\ndeadly. It was a horrible thing; and I would give much to forget that I\nhave ever seen it; for it haunts me to this day.\nIt was impossible to tell how old this Jackson was; for he had no\nbeard, and no wrinkles, except small crowsfeet about the eyes. He might\nhave seen thirty, or perhaps fifty years. But according to his own\naccount, he had been to sea ever since he was eight years old, when he\nfirst went as a cabin-boy in an Indiaman, and ran away at Calcutta. And\naccording to his own account, too, he had passed through every kind of\ndissipation and abandonment in the worst parts of the world. He had\nserved in Portuguese slavers on the coast of Africa; and with a\ndiabolical relish used to tell of the _middle-passage,_ where the\nslaves were stowed, heel and point, like logs, and the suffocated and\ndead were unmanacled, and weeded out from the living every morning,\nbefore washing down the decks; how he had been in a slaving schooner,\nwhich being chased by an English cruiser off Cape Verde, received three\nshots in her hull, which raked through and through a whole file of\nslaves, that were chained.\nHe would tell of lying in Batavia during a fever, when his ship lost a\nman every few days, and how they went reeling ashore with the body, and\ngot still more intoxicated by way of precaution against the plague. He\nwould talk of finding a cobra-di-capello, or hooded snake, under his\npillow in India, when he slept ashore there. He would talk of sailors\nbeing poisoned at Canton with drugged _\u201cshampoo,\u201d_ for the sake of\ntheir money; and of the Malay ruffians, who stopped ships in the\nstraits of Caspar, and always saved the captain for the last, so as to\nmake him point out where the most valuable goods were stored.\nHis whole talk was of this land; full of piracies, plagues and\npoisonings. And often he narrated many passages in his own individual\ncareer, which were almost incredible, from the consideration that few\nmen could have plunged into such infamous vices, and clung to them so\nlong, without paying the death-penalty.\nBut in truth, he carried about with him the traces of these things, and\nthe mark of a fearful end nigh at hand; like that of King Antiochus of\nSyria, who died a worse death, history says, than if he had been stung\nout of the world by wasps and hornets.\nNothing was left of this Jackson but the foul lees and dregs of a man;\nhe was thin as a shadow; nothing but skin and bones; and sometimes used\nto complain, that it hurt him to sit on the hard chests. And I\nsometimes fancied, it was the consciousness of his miserable,\nbroken-down condition, and the prospect of soon dying like a dog, in\nconsequence of his sins, that made this poor wretch always eye me with\nsuch malevolence as he did. For I was young and handsome, at least my\nmother so thought me, and as soon as I became a little used to the sea,\nand shook off my low spirits somewhat, I began to have my old color in\nmy cheeks, and, spite of misfortune, to appear well and hearty; whereas\n_he_ was being consumed by an incurable malady, that was eating up his\nvitals, and was more fit for a hospital than a ship.\nAs I am sometimes by nature inclined to indulge in unauthorized\nsurmisings about the thoughts going on with regard to me, in the people\nI meet; especially if I have reason to think they dislike me; I will\nnot put it down for a certainty that what I suspected concerning this\nJackson relative to his thoughts of me, was really the truth. But only\nstate my honest opinion, and how it struck me at the time; and even\nnow, I think I was not wrong. And indeed, unless it was so, how could I\naccount to myself, for the shudder that would run through me, when I\ncaught this man gazing at me, as I often did; for he was apt to be dumb\nat times, and would sit with his eyes fixed, and his teeth set, like a\nman in the moody madness.\nI well remember the first time I saw him, and how I was startled at his\neye, which was even then fixed upon me. He was standing at the ship\u2019s\nhelm, being the first man that got there, when a steersman was called\nfor by the pilot; for this Jackson was always on the alert for easy\nduties, and used to plead his delicate health as the reason for\nassuming them, as he did; though I used to think, that for a man in\npoor health, he was very swift on the legs; at least when a good place\nwas to be jumped to; though that might only have been a sort of\nspasmodic exertion under strong inducements, which every one knows the\ngreatest invalids will sometimes show.\nAnd though the sailors were always very bitter against any thing like\n_sogering,_ as they called it; that is, any thing that savored of a\ndesire to get rid of downright hard work; yet, I observed that, though\nthis Jackson was a notorious old _soger_ the whole voyage (I mean, in\nall things not perilous to do, from which he was far from hanging\nback), and in truth was a great veteran that way, and one who must have\npassed unhurt through many campaigns; yet, they never presumed to call\nhim to account in any way; or to let him so much as think, what they\nthought of his conduct. But I often heard them call him many hard names\nbehind his back; and sometimes, too, when, perhaps, they had just been\ntenderly inquiring after his health before his face. They all stood in\nmortal fear of him; and cringed and fawned about him like so many\nspaniels; and used to rub his back, after he was undressed and lying in\nhis bunk; and used to run up on deck to the cook-house, to warm some\ncold coffee for him; and used to fill his pipe, and give him chews of\ntobacco, and mend his jackets and trowsers; and used to watch, and\ntend, and nurse him every way. And all the time, he would sit scowling\non them, and found fault with what they did; and I noticed, that those\nwho did the most for him, and cringed the most before him, were the\nvery ones he most abused; while two or three who held more aloof, he\ntreated with a little consideration.\nIt is not for me to say, what it was that made a whole ship\u2019s company\nsubmit so to the whims of one poor miserable man like Jackson. I only\nknow that so it was; but I have no doubt, that if he had had a blue eye\nin his head, or had had a different face from what he did have, they\nwould not have stood in such awe of him. And it astonished me, to see\nthat one of the seamen, a remarkably robust and good-humored young man\nfrom Belfast in Ireland, was a person of no mark or influence among the\ncrew; but on the contrary was hooted at, and trampled upon, and made a\nbutt and laughing-stock; and more than all, was continually being\nabused and snubbed by Jackson, who seemed to hate him cordially,\nbecause of his great strength and fine person, and particularly because\nof his red cheeks.\nBut then, this Belfast man, although he had shipped for an\n_able-seaman,_ was not much of a sailor; and that always lowers a man\nin the eyes of a ship\u2019s company; I mean, when he ships for an\n_able-seaman,_ but is not able to do the duty of one. For sailors are\nof three classes\u2014_able-seaman, ordinary-seaman,_ and _boys;_ and they\nreceive different wages according to their rank. Generally, a ship\u2019s\ncompany of twelve men will only have five or six able seamen, who if\nthey prove to understand their duty every way (and that is no small\nmatter either, as I shall hereafter show, perhaps), are looked up to,\nand thought much of by the ordinary-seamen and boys, who reverence\ntheir very pea-jackets, and lay up their sayings in their hearts.\nBut you must not think from this, that persons called _boys_ aboard\nmerchant-ships are all youngsters, though to be sure, I myself was\ncalled a _boy,_ and a boy I was. No. In merchant-ships, a _boy_ means a\ngreen-hand, a landsman on his first voyage. And never mind if he is old\nenough to be a grandfather, he is still called a _boy;_ and boys\u2019 work\nis put upon him.\nBut I am straying off from what I was going to say about Jackson\u2019s\nputting an end to the dispute between the two sailors in the forecastle\nafter breakfast. After they had been disputing some time about who had\nbeen to sea the longest, Jackson told them to stop talking; and then\nbade one of them open his mouth; for, said he, I can tell a sailor\u2019s\nage just like a horse\u2019s\u2014by his teeth. So the man laughed, and opened\nhis mouth; and Jackson made him step out under the scuttle, where the\nlight came down from deck; and then made him throw his head back, while\nhe looked into it, and probed a little with his jackknife, like a\nbaboon peering into a junk-bottle. I trembled for the poor fellow, just\nas if I had seen him under the hands of a crazy barber, making signs to\ncut his throat, and he all the while sitting stock still, with the\nlather on, to be shaved. For I watched Jackson\u2019s eye and saw it\nsnapping, and a sort of going in and out, very quick, as if it were\nsomething like a forked tongue; and somehow, I felt as if he were\nlonging to kill the man; but at last he grew more composed, and after\nconcluding his examination, said, that the first man was the oldest\nsailor, for the ends of his teeth were the evenest and most worn down;\nwhich, he said, arose from eating so much hard sea-biscuit; and this\nwas the reason he could tell a sailor\u2019s age like a horse\u2019s.\nAt this, every body made merry, and looked at each other, as much as to\n_say\u2014come, boys, let\u2019s laugh;_ and they did laugh; and declared it was\na rare joke.\nThis was always the way with them. They made a point of shouting out,\nwhenever Jackson said any thing with a grin; that being the sign to\nthem that he himself thought it funny; though I heard many good jokes\nfrom others pass off without a smile; and once Jackson himself (for, to\ntell the truth, he sometimes had a comical way with him, that is, when\nhis back did not ache) told a truly funny story, but with a grave face;\nwhen, not knowing how he meant it, whether for a laugh or otherwise,\nthey all sat still, waiting what to do, and looking perplexed enough;\ntill at last Jackson roared out upon them for a parcel of fools and\nidiots; and told them to their beards, how it was; that he had\npurposely put on his grave face, to see whether they would not look\ngrave, too; even when he was telling something that ought to split\ntheir sides. And with that, he flouted, and jeered at them, and laughed\nthem all to scorn; and broke out in such a rage, that his lips began to\nglue together at the corners with a fine white foam.\nHe seemed to be full of hatred and gall against every thing and every\nbody in the world; as if all the world was one person, and had done him\nsome dreadful harm, that was rankling and festering in his heart.\nSometimes I thought he was really crazy; and often felt so frightened\nat him, that I thought of going to the captain about it, and telling\nhim Jackson ought to be confined, lest he should do some terrible thing\nat last. But upon second thoughts, I always gave it up; for the captain\nwould only have called me a fool, and sent me forward again.\nBut you must not think that all the sailors were alike in abasing\nthemselves before this man. No: there were three or four who used to\nstand up sometimes against him; and when he was absent at the wheel,\nwould plot against him among the other sailors, and tell them what a\nshame and ignominy it was, that such a poor miserable wretch should be\nsuch a tyrant over much better men than himself. And they begged and\nconjured them as men, to put up with it no longer, but the very next\ntime, that Jackson presumed to play the dictator, that they should all\nwithstand him, and let him know his place. Two or three times nearly\nall hands agreed to it, with the exception of those who used to slink\noff during such discussions; and swore that they would not any more\nsubmit to being ruled by Jackson. But when the time came to make good\ntheir oaths, they were mum again, and let every thing go on the old\nway; so that those who had put them up to it, had to bear all the brunt\nof Jackson\u2019s wrath by themselves. And though these last would stick up\na little at first, and even mutter something about a fight to Jackson;\nyet in the end, finding themselves unbefriended by the rest, they would\ngradually become silent, and leave the field to the tyrant, who would\nthen fly out worse than ever, and dare them to do their worst, and jeer\nat them for white-livered poltroons, who did not have a mouthful of\nheart in them. At such times, there were no bounds to his contempt; and\nindeed, all the time he seemed to have even more contempt than hatred,\nfor every body and every thing.\nAs for me, I was but a boy; and at any time aboard ship, a boy is\nexpected to keep quiet, do what he is bid, never presume to interfere,\nand seldom to talk, unless spoken to. For merchant sailors have a great\nidea of their dignity, and superiority to _greenhorns_ and _landsmen,_\nwho know nothing about a ship; and they seem to think, that an _able\nseaman_ is a great man; at least a much greater man than a little boy.\nAnd the able seamen in the Highlander had such grand notions about\ntheir seamanship, that I almost thought that able seamen received\ndiplomas, like those given at colleges; and were made a sort _A.M.S,_\nor _Masters of Arts._\nBut though I kept thus quiet, and had very little to say, and well knew\nthat my best plan was to get along peaceably with every body, and\nindeed endure a good deal before showing fight, yet I could not avoid\nJackson\u2019s evil eye, nor escape his bitter enmity. And his being my foe,\nset many of the rest against me; or at least they were afraid to speak\nout for me before Jackson; so that at last I found myself a sort of\nIshmael in the ship, without a single friend or companion; and I began\nto feel a hatred growing up in me against the whole crew\u2014so much so,\nthat I prayed against it, that it might not master my heart completely,\nand so make a fiend of me, something like Jackson.\nCHAPTER XIII.\nHE HAS A FINE DAY AT SEA, BEGINS TO LIKE IT; BUT CHANGES HIS MIND\nThe second day out of port, the decks being washed down and breakfast\nover, the watch was called, and the mate set us to work.\nIt was a very bright day. The sky and water were both of the same deep\nhue; and the air felt warm and sunny; so that we threw off our jackets.\nI could hardly believe that I was sailing in the same ship I had been\nin during the night, when every thing had been so lonely and dim; and I\ncould hardly imagine that this was the same ocean, now so beautiful and\nblue, that during part of the night-watch had rolled along so black and\nforbidding.\nThere were little traces of sunny clouds all over the heavens; and\nlittle fleeces of foam all over the sea; and the ship made a strange,\nmusical noise under her bows, as she glided along, with her sails all\nstill. It seemed a pity to go to work at such a time; and if we could\nonly have sat in the windlass again; or if they would have let me go\nout on the bowsprit, and lay down between the _manropes_ there, and\nlook over at the fish in the water, and think of home, I should have\nbeen almost happy for a time.\nI had now completely got over my sea-sickness, and felt very well; at\nleast in my body, though my heart was far from feeling right; so that I\ncould now look around me, and make observations.\nAnd truly, though we were at sea, there was much to behold and wonder\nat; to me, who was on my first voyage. What most amazed me was the\nsight of the great ocean itself, for we were out of sight of land. All\nround us, on both sides of the ship, ahead and astern, nothing was to\nbe seen but water\u2014water\u2014water; not a single glimpse of green shore, not\nthe smallest island, or speck of moss any where. Never did I realize\ntill now what the ocean was: how grand and majestic, how solitary, and\nboundless, and beautiful and blue; for that day it gave no tokens of\nsqualls or hurricanes, such as I had heard my father tell of; nor could\nI imagine, how any thing that seemed so playful and placid, could be\nlashed into rage, and troubled into rolling avalanches of foam, and\ngreat cascades of waves, such as I saw in the end.\nAs I looked at it so mild and sunny, I could not help calling to mind\nmy little brother\u2019s face, when he was sleeping an infant in the cradle.\nIt had just such a happy, careless, innocent look; and every happy\nlittle wave seemed gamboling about like a thoughtless little kid in a\npasture; and seemed to look up in your face as it passed, as if it\nwanted to be patted and caressed. They seemed all live things with\nhearts in them, that could feel; and I almost felt grieved, as we\nsailed in among them, scattering them under our broad bows in\nsun-flakes, and riding over them like a great elephant among lambs. But\nwhat seemed perhaps the most strange to me of all, was a certain\nwonderful rising and falling of the sea; I do not mean the waves\nthemselves, but a sort of wide heaving and swelling and sinking all\nover the ocean. It was something I can not very well describe; but I\nknow very well what it was, and how it affected me. It made me almost\ndizzy to look at it; and yet I could not keep my eyes off it, it seemed\nso passing strange and wonderful.\nI felt as if in a dream all the time; and when I could shut the ship\nout, almost thought I was in some new, fairy world, and expected to\nhear myself called to, out of the clear blue air, or from the depths of\nthe deep blue sea. But I did not have much leisure to indulge in such\nthoughts; for the men were now getting some _stun\u2019-sails_ ready to\nhoist aloft, as the wind was getting fairer and fairer for us; and\nthese stun\u2019-sails are light canvas which are spread at such times, away\nout beyond the ends of the yards, where they overhang the wide water,\nlike the wings of a great bird.\nFor my own part, I could do but little to help the rest, not knowing\nthe name of any thing, or the proper way to go about aught. Besides, I\nfelt very dreamy, as I said before; and did not exactly know where, or\nwhat I was; every thing was so strange and new.\nWhile the stun\u2019-sails were lying all tumbled upon the deck, and the\nsailors were fastening them to the booms, getting them ready to hoist,\nthe mate ordered me to do a great many simple things, none of which\ncould I comprehend, owing to the queer words he used; and then, seeing\nme stand quite perplexed and confounded, he would roar out at me, and\ncall me all manner of names, and the sailors would laugh and wink to\neach other, but durst not go farther than that, for fear of the mate,\nwho in his own presence would not let any body laugh at me but himself.\nHowever, I tried to wake up as much as I could, and keep from dreaming\nwith my eyes open; and being, at bottom, a smart, apt lad, at last I\nmanaged to learn a thing or two, so that I did not appear so much like\na fool as at first.\nPeople who have never gone to sea for the first time as sailors, can\nnot imagine how puzzling and confounding it is. It must be like going\ninto a barbarous country, where they speak a strange dialect, and dress\nin strange clothes, and live in strange houses. For sailors have their\nown names, even for things that are familiar ashore; and if you call a\nthing by its shore name, you are laughed at for an ignoramus and a\nlandlubber. This first day I speak of, the mate having ordered me to\ndraw some water, I asked him where I was to get the pail; when I\nthought I had committed some dreadful crime; for he flew into a great\npassion, and said they never had any _pails_ at sea, and then I learned\nthat they were always called _buckets._ And once I was talking about\nsticking a little wooden peg into a bucket to stop a leak, when he flew\nout again, and said there were no _pegs_ at sea, only _plugs._ And just\nso it was with every thing else.\nBut besides all this, there is such an infinite number of totally new\nnames of new things to learn, that at first it seemed impossible for me\nto master them all. If you have ever seen a ship, you must have\nremarked what a thicket of ropes there are; and how they all seemed\nmixed and entangled together like a great skein of yarn. Now the very\nsmallest of these ropes has its own proper name, and many of them are\nvery lengthy, like the names of young royal princes, such as the\n_starboard-main-top-gallant-bow-line,_ or the\n_larboard-fore-top-sail-clue-line._\nI think it would not be a bad plan to have a grand new naming of a\nship\u2019s ropes, as I have read, they once had a simplifying of the\nclasses of plants in Botany. It is really wonderful how many names\nthere are in the world. There is no counting the names, that surgeons\nand anatomists give to the various parts of the human body; which,\nindeed, is something like a ship; its bones being the stiff\nstanding-rigging, and the sinews the small running ropes, that manage\nall the motions.\nI wonder whether mankind could not get along without all these names,\nwhich keep increasing every day, and hour, and moment; till at last the\nvery air will be full of them; and even in a great plain, men will be\nbreathing each other\u2019s breath, owing to the vast multitude of words\nthey use, that consume all the air, just as lamp-burners do gas. But\npeople seem to have a great love for names; for to know a great many\nnames, seems to look like knowing a good many things; though I should\nnot be surprised, if there were a great many more names than things in\nthe world. But I must quit this rambling, and return to my story.\nAt last we hoisted the stun\u2019-sails up to the top-sail yards, and as\nsoon as the vessel felt them, she gave a sort of bound like a horse,\nand the breeze blowing more and more, she went plunging along, shaking\noff the foam from her bows, like foam from a bridle-bit. Every mast and\ntimber seemed to have a pulse in it that was beating with life and joy;\nand I felt a wild exulting in my own heart, and felt as if I would be\nglad to bound along so round the world.\nThen was I first conscious of a wonderful thing in me, that responded\nto all the wild commotion of the outer world; and went reeling on and\non with the planets in their orbits, and was lost in one delirious\nthrob at the center of the All. A wild bubbling and bursting was at my\nheart, as if a hidden spring had just gushed out there; and my blood\nran tingling along my frame, like mountain brooks in spring freshets.\nYes! yes! give me this glorious ocean life, this salt-sea life, this\nbriny, foamy life, when the sea neighs and snorts, and you breathe the\nvery breath that the great whales respire! Let me roll around the\nglobe, let me rock upon the sea; let me race and pant out my life, with\nan eternal breeze astern, and an endless sea before!\nBut how soon these raptures abated, when after a brief idle interval,\nwe were again set to work, and I had a vile commission to clean out the\nchicken coops, and make up the beds of the pigs in the long-boat.\nMiserable dog\u2019s life is this of the sea! commanded like a slave, and\nset to work like an ass! vulgar and brutal men lording it over me, as\nif I were an African in Alabama. Yes, yes, blow on, ye breezes, and\nmake a speedy end to this abominable voyage!\nCHAPTER XIV.\nHE CONTEMPLATES MAKING A SOCIAL CALL ON THE CAPTAIN IN HIS CABIN\nWhat reminded me most forcibly of my ignominious condition, was the\nwidely altered manner of the captain toward me.\nI had thought him a fine, funny gentleman, full of mirth and good\nhumor, and good will to seamen, and one who could not fail to\nappreciate the difference between me and the rude sailors among whom I\nwas thrown. Indeed, I had made no doubt that he would in some special\nmanner take me under his protection, and prove a kind friend and\nbenefactor to me; as I had heard that some sea-captains are fathers to\ntheir crew; and so they are; but such fathers as Solomon\u2019s precepts\ntend to make\u2014severe and chastising fathers, fathers whose sense of duty\novercomes the sense of love, and who every day, in some sort, play the\npart of Brutus, who ordered his son away to execution, as I have read\nin our old family Plutarch.\nYes, I thought that Captain Riga, for Riga was his name, would be\nattentive and considerate to me, and strive to cheer me up, and comfort\nme in my lonesomeness. I did not even deem it at all impossible that he\nwould invite me down into the cabin of a pleasant night, to ask me\nquestions concerning my parents, and prospects in life; besides\nobtaining from me some anecdotes touching my great-uncle, the\nillustrious senator; or give me a slate and pencil, and teach me\nproblems in navigation; or perhaps engage me at a game of chess. I even\nthought he might invite me to dinner on a sunny Sunday, and help me\nplentifully to the nice cabin fare, as knowing how distasteful the salt\nbeef and pork, and hard biscuit of the forecastle must at first be to a\nboy like me, who had always lived ashore, and at home.\nAnd I could not help regarding him with peculiar emotions, almost of\ntenderness and love, as the last visible link in the chain of\nassociations which bound me to my home. For, while yet in port, I had\nseen him and Mr. Jones, my brother\u2019s friend, standing together and\nconversing; so that from the captain to my brother there was but one\nintermediate step; and my brother and mother and sisters were one.\nAnd this reminds me how often I used to pass by the places on deck,\nwhere I remembered Mr. Jones had stood when we first visited the ship\nlying at the wharf; and how I tried to convince myself that it was\nindeed true, that he had stood there, though now the ship was so far\naway on the wide Atlantic Ocean, and he perhaps was walking down\nWall-street, or sitting reading the newspaper in his counting room,\nwhile poor I was so differently employed.\nWhen two or three days had passed without the captain\u2019s speaking to me\nin any way, or sending word into the forecastle that he wished me to\ndrop into the cabin to pay my respects. I began to think whether I\nshould not make the first advances, and whether indeed he did not\nexpect it of me, since I was but a boy, and he a man; and perhaps that\nmight have been the reason why he had not spoken to me yet, deeming it\nmore proper and respectful for me to address him first. I thought he\nmight be offended, too, especially if he were a proud man, with tender\nfeelings. So one evening, a little before sundown, in the second\ndog-watch, when there was no more work to be done, I concluded to call\nand see him.\nAfter drawing a bucket of water, and having a good washing, to get off\nsome of the chicken-coop stains, I went down into the forecastle to\ndress myself as neatly as I could. I put on a white shirt in place of\nmy red one, and got into a pair of cloth trowsers instead of my duck\nones, and put on my new pumps, and then carefully brushing my\nshooting-jacket, I put that on over all, so that upon the whole, I made\nquite a genteel figure, at least for a forecastle, though I would not\nhave looked so well in a drawing-room.\nWhen the sailors saw me thus employed, they did not know what to make\nof it, and wanted to know whether I was dressing to go ashore; I told\nthem no, for we were then out of sight of mind; but that I was going to\npay my respects to the captain. Upon which they all laughed and\nshouted, as if I were a simpleton; though there seemed nothing so very\nsimple in going to make an evening call upon a friend. When some of\nthem tried to dissuade me, saying I was green and raw; but Jackson, who\nsat looking on, cried out, with a hideous grin, \u201cLet him go, let him\ngo, men\u2014he\u2019s a nice boy. Let him go; the captain has some nuts and\nraisins for him.\u201d And so he was going on, when one of his violent fits\nof coughing seized him, and he almost choked.\nAs I was about leaving the forecastle, I happened to look at my hands,\nand seeing them stained all over of a deep yellow, for that morning the\nmate had set me to tarring some strips of canvas for the rigging I\nthought it would never do to present myself before a gentleman that\nway; so for want of lads, I slipped on a pair of woolen mittens, which\nmy mother had knit for me to carry to sea. As I was putting them on,\nJackson asked me whether he shouldn\u2019t call a carriage; and another bade\nme not forget to present his best respects to the skipper. I left them\nall tittering, and coming on deck was passing the cook-house, when the\nold cook called after me, saying I had forgot my cane.\nBut I did not heed their impudence, and was walking straight toward the\ncabin-door on the quarter-deck, when the chief mate met me. I touched\nmy hat, and was passing him, when, after staring at me till I thought\nhis eyes would burst out, he all at once caught me by the collar, and\nwith a voice of thunder, wanted to know what I meant by playing such\ntricks aboard a ship that he was mate of? I told him to let go of me,\nor I would complain to my friend the captain, whom I intended to visit\nthat evening. Upon this he gave me such a whirl round, that I thought\nthe Gulf Stream was in my head; and then shoved me forward, roaring out\nI know not what. Meanwhile the sailors were all standing round the\nwindlass looking aft, mightily tickled.\nSeeing I could not effect my object that night, I thought it best to\ndefer it for the present; and returning among the sailors, Jackson\nasked me how I had found the captain, and whether the next time I went,\nI would not take a friend along and introduce him.\nThe upshot of this business was, that before I went to sleep that\nnight, I felt well satisfied that it was not customary for sailors to\ncall on the captain in the cabin; and I began to have an inkling of the\nfact, that I had acted like a fool; but it all arose from my ignorance\nof sea usages.\nAnd here I may as well state, that I never saw the inside of the cabin\nduring the whole interval that elapsed from our sailing till our return\nto New York; though I often used to get a peep at it through a little\npane of glass, set in the house on deck, just before the helm, where a\nwatch was kept hanging for the helmsman to strike the half hours by,\nwith his little bell in the binnacle, where the compass was. And it\nused to be the great amusement of the sailors to look in through the\npane of glass, when they stood at the wheel, and watch the proceedings\nin the cabin; especially when the steward was setting the table for\ndinner, or the captain was lounging over a decanter of wine on a little\nmahogany stand, or playing the game called _solitaire,_ at cards, of an\nevening; for at times he was all alone with his dignity; though, as\nwill ere long be shown, he generally had one pleasant companion, whose\nsociety he did not dislike.\nThe day following my attempt to drop in at the cabin, I happened to be\nmaking fast a rope on the quarter-deck, when the captain suddenly made\nhis appearance, promenading up and down, and smoking a cigar. He looked\nvery good-humored and amiable, and it being just after his dinner, I\nthought that this, to be sure, was just the chance I wanted.\nI waited a little while, thinking he would speak to me himself; but as\nhe did not, I went up to him, and began by saying it was a very\npleasant day, and hoped he was very well. I never saw a man fly into\nsuch a rage; I thought he was going to knock me down; but after\nstanding speechless awhile, he all at once plucked his cap from his\nhead and threw it at me. I don\u2019t know what impelled me, but I ran to\nthe lee-scuppers where it fell, picked it up, and gave it to him with a\nbow; when the mate came running up, and thrust me forward again; and\nafter he had got me as far as the windlass, he wanted to know whether I\nwas crazy or not; for if I was, he would put me in irons right off, and\nhave done with it.\nBut I assured him I was in my right mind, and knew perfectly well that\nI had been treated in the most rude and un-gentlemanly manner both by\nhim and Captain Riga. Upon this, he rapped out a great oath, and told\nme if I ever repeated what I had done that evening, or ever again\npresumed so much as to lift my hat to the captain, he would tie me into\nthe rigging, and keep me there until I learned better manners. \u201cYou are\nvery green,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I\u2019ll ripen you.\u201d Indeed this chief mate\nseemed to have the keeping of the dignity of the captain; who, in some\nsort, seemed too dignified personally to protect his own dignity.\nI thought this strange enough, to be reprimanded, and charged with\nrudeness for an act of common civility. However, seeing how matters\nstood, I resolved to let the captain alone for the future, particularly\nas he had shown himself so deficient in the ordinary breeding of a\ngentleman. And I could hardly credit it, that this was the same man who\nhad been so very civil, and polite, and witty, when Mr. Jones and I\ncalled upon him in port.\nBut this astonishment of mine was much increased, when some days after,\na storm came upon us, and the captain rushed out of the cabin in his\nnightcap, and nothing else but his shirt on; and leaping up on the\npoop, began to jump up and down, and curse and swear, and call the men\naloft all manner of hard names, just like a common loafer in the\nstreet.\nBesides all this, too, I noticed that while we were at sea, he wore\nnothing but old shabby clothes, very different from the glossy suit I\nhad seen him in at our first interview, and after that on the steps of\nthe City Hotel, where he always boarded when in New York. Now, he wore\nnothing but old-fashioned snuff-colored coats, with high collars and\nshort waists; and faded, short-legged pantaloons, very tight about the\nknees; and vests, that did not conceal his waistbands, owing to their\nbeing so short, just like a little boy\u2019s. And his hats were all caved\nin, and battered, as if they had been knocked about in a cellar; and\nhis boots were sadly patched. Indeed, I began to think that he was but\na shabby fellow after all; particularly as his whiskers lost their\ngloss, and he went days together without shaving; and his hair, by a\nsort of miracle, began to grow of a pepper and salt color, which might\nhave been owing, though, to his discontinuing the use of some kind of\ndye while at sea. I put him down as a sort of impostor; and while\nashore, a gentleman on false pretenses; for no gentleman would have\ntreated another gentleman as he did me.\nYes, Captain Riga, thought I, you are no gentleman, and you know it!\nCHAPTER XV.\nTHE MELANCHOLY STATE OF HIS WARDROBE\nAnd now that I have been speaking of the captain\u2019s old clothes, I may\nas well speak of mine.\nIt was very early in the month of June that we sailed; and I had\ngreatly rejoiced that it was that time of the year; for it would be\nwarm and pleasant upon the ocean, I thought; and my voyage would be\nlike a summer excursion to the sea shore, for the benefit of the salt\nwater, and a change of scene and society.\nSo I had not given myself much concern about what I should wear; and\ndeemed it wholly unnecessary to provide myself with a great outfit of\npilot-cloth jackets, and browsers, and Guernsey frocks, and oil-skin\nsuits, and sea-boots, and many other things, which old seamen carry in\ntheir chests. But one reason was, that I did not have the money to buy\nthem with, even if I had wanted to. So in addition to the clothes I had\nbrought from home, I had only bought a red shirt, a tarpaulin hat, and\na belt and knife, as I have previously related, which gave me a sea\noutfit, something like the Texan rangers\u2019, whose uniform, they say,\nconsists of a shirt collar and a pair of spurs.\nBut I was not many days at sea, when I found that my shore clothing, or\n_\u201clong togs,\u201d_ as the sailors call them, were but ill adapted to the\nlife I now led. When I went aloft, at my yard-arm gymnastics, my\npantaloons were all the time ripping and splitting in every direction,\nparticularly about the seat, owing to their not being cut\nsailor-fashion, with low waistbands, and to wear without suspenders. So\nthat I was often placed in most unpleasant predicaments, straddling the\nrigging, sometimes in plain sight of the cabin, with my table linen\nexposed in the most inelegant and ungentlemanly manner possible.\nAnd worse than all, my best pair of pantaloons, and the pair I most\nprided myself upon, was a very conspicuous and remarkable looking pair.\nI had had them made to order by our village tailor, a little fat man,\nvery thin in the legs, and who used to say he imported the latest\nfashions direct from Paris; though all the fashion plates in his shop\nwere very dirty with fly-marks.\nWell, this tailor made the pantaloons I speak of, and while he had them\nin hand, I used to call and see him two or three times a day to try\nthem on, and hurry him forward; for he was an old man with large round\nspectacles, and could not see very well, and had no one to help him but\na sick wife, with five grandchildren to take care of; and besides that,\nhe was such a great snuff-taker, that it interfered with his business;\nfor he took several pinches for every stitch, and would sit snuffing\nand blowing his nose over my pantaloons, till I used to get disgusted\nwith him. Now, this old tailor had shown me the pattern, after which he\nintended to make my pantaloons; but I improved upon it, and bade him\nhave a slit on the outside of each leg, at the foot, to button up with\na row of six brass bell buttons; for a grown-up cousin of mine, who was\na great sportsman, used to wear a beautiful pair of pantaloons, made\nprecisely in that way.\nAnd these were the very pair I now had at sea; the sailors made a great\ndeal of fun of them, and were all the time calling on each other to\n\u201ctwig\u201d them; and they would ask me to lend them a button or two, by way\nof a joke; and then they would ask me if I was not a soldier. Showing\nvery plainly that they had no idea that my pantaloons were a very\ngenteel pair, made in the height of the sporting fashion, and copied\nfrom my cousin\u2019s, who was a young man of fortune and drove a tilbury.\nWhen my pantaloons ripped and tore, as I have said, I did my best to\nmend and patch them; but not being much of a sempstress, the more I\npatched the more they parted; because I put my patches on, without\nheeding the joints of the legs, which only irritated my poor pants the\nmore, and put them out of temper.\nNor must I forget my boots, which were almost new when I left home.\nThey had been my Sunday boots, and fitted me to a charm. I never had\nhad a pair of boots that I liked better; I used to turn my toes out\nwhen I walked in them, unless it was night time, when no one could see\nme, and I had something else to think of; and I used to keep looking at\nthem during church; so that I lost a good deal of the sermon. In a\nword, they were a beautiful pair of boots. But all this only unfitted\nthem the more for sea-service; as I soon discovered. They had very high\nheels, which were all the time tripping me in the rigging, and several\ntimes came near pitching me overboard; and the salt water made them\nshrink in such a manner, that they pinched me terribly about the\ninstep; and I was obliged to gash them cruelly, which went to my very\nheart. The legs were quite long, coming a good way up toward my knees,\nand the edges were mounted with red morocco. The sailors used to call\nthem my _\u201cgaff-topsail-boots.\u201d_ And sometimes they used to call me\n\u201cBoots,\u201d and sometimes \u201cButtons,\u201d on account of the ornaments on my\npantaloons and shooting-jacket.\nAt last, I took their advice, and _\u201crazeed\u201d_ them, as they phrased it.\nThat is, I amputated the legs, and shaved off the heels to the bare\nsoles; which, however, did not much improve them, for it made my feet\nfeel flat as flounders, and besides, brought me down in the world, and\nmade me slip and slide about the decks, as I used to at home, when I\nwore straps on the ice.\nAs for my tarpaulin hat, it was a very cheap one; and therefore proved\na real sham and shave; it leaked like an old shingle roof; and in a\nrain storm, kept my hair wet and disagreeable. Besides, from lying down\non deck in it, during the night watches, it got bruised and battered,\nand lost all its beauty; so that it was unprofitable every way.\nBut I had almost forgotten my shooting-jacket, which was made of\nmoleskin. Every day, it grew smaller and smaller, particularly after a\nrain, until at last I thought it would completely exhale, and leave\nnothing but the bare seams, by way of a skeleton, on my back. It became\nunspeakably unpleasant, when we got into rather cold weather, crossing\nthe Banks of Newfoundland, when the only way I had to keep warm during\nthe night, was to pull on my waistcoat and my roundabout, and then clap\nthe shooting-jacket over all. This made it pinch me under the arms, and\nit vexed, irritated, and tormented me every way; and used to incommode\nmy arms seriously when I was pulling the ropes; so much so, that the\nmate asked me once if I had the cramp.\nI may as well here glance at some trials and tribulations of a similar\nkind. I had no mattress, or bed-clothes, of any sort; for the thought\nof them had never entered my mind before going to sea; so that I was\nobliged to sleep on the bare boards of my bunk; and when the ship\npitched violently, and almost stood upon end, I must have looked like\nan Indian baby tied to a plank, and hung up against a tree like a\ncrucifix.\nI have already mentioned my total want of table-tools; never dreaming,\nthat, in this respect, going to sea as a sailor was something like\ngoing to a boarding-school, where you must furnish your own spoon and\nknife, fork, and napkin. But at length, I was so happy as to barter\nwith a steerage passenger a silk handkerchief of mine for a half-gallon\niron pot, with hooks to it, to hang on a grate; and this pot I used to\npresent at the cook-house for my allowance of coffee and tea. It gave\nme a good deal of trouble, though, to keep it clean, being much\ndisposed to rust; and the hooks sometimes scratched my face when I was\ndrinking; and it was unusually large and heavy; so that my breakfasts\nwere deprived of all ease and satisfaction, and became a toil and a\nlabor to me. And I was forced to use the same pot for my bean-soup,\nthree times a week, which imparted to it a bad flavor for coffee.\nI can not tell how I really suffered in many ways for my improvidence\nand heedlessness, in going to sea so ill provided with every thing\ncalculated to make my situation at all comfortable, or even tolerable.\nIn time, my wretched \u201clong togs\u201d began to drop off my back, and I\nlooked like a Sam Patch, shambling round the deck in my rags and the\nwreck of my gaff-topsail-boots. I often thought what my friends at home\nwould have said, if they could but get one peep at me. But I hugged\nmyself in my miserable shooting-jacket, when I considered that that\ndegradation and shame never could overtake me; yet, I thought it a\ngalling mockery, when I remembered that my sisters had promised to tell\nall inquiring friends, that Wellingborough had gone _\u201cabroad\u201d_ just as\nif I was visiting Europe on a tour with my tutor, as poor simple Mr.\nJones had hinted to the captain.\nStill, in spite of the melancholy which sometimes overtook me, there\nwere several little incidents that made me forget myself in the\ncontemplation of the strange and to me most wonderful sights of the\nsea.\nAnd perhaps nothing struck into me such a feeling of wild romance, as a\nview of the first vessel we spoke. It was of a clear sunny afternoon,\nand she came bearing down upon us, a most beautiful sight, with all her\nsails spread wide. She came very near, and passed under our stern; and\nas she leaned over to the breeze, showed her decks fore and aft; and I\nsaw the strange sailors grouped upon the forecastle, and the cook\nlooking out of his cook-house with a ladle in his hand, and the captain\nin a green jacket sitting on the taffrail with a speaking-trumpet.\nAnd here, had this vessel come out of the infinite blue ocean, with all\nthese human beings on board, and the smoke tranquilly mounting up into\nthe sea-air from the cook\u2019s funnel as if it were a chimney in a city;\nand every thing looking so cool, and calm, and of-course, in the midst\nof what to me, at least, seemed a superlative marvel.\nHoisted at her mizzen-peak was a red flag, with a turreted white castle\nin the middle, which looked foreign enough, and made me stare all the\nharder.\nOur captain, who had put on another hat and coat, and was lounging in\nan elegant attitude on the poop, now put his high polished brass\ntrumpet to his mouth, and said in a very rude voice for conversation,\n_\u201cWhere from?\u201d_\nTo which the other captain rejoined with some outlandish Dutch\ngibberish, of which we could only make out, that the ship belonged to\nHamburg, as her flag denoted.\n_Hamburg!_\nBless my soul! and here I am on the great Atlantic Ocean, actually\nbeholding a ship from Holland! It was passing strange. In my intervals\nof leisure from other duties, I followed the strange ship till she was\nquite a little speck in the distance.\nI could not but be struck with the manner of the two sea-captains\nduring their brief interview. Seated at their ease on their respective\n\u201cpoops\u201d toward the stern of their ships, while the sailors were obeying\ntheir behests; they touched hats to each other, exchanged compliments,\nand drove on, with all the indifference of two Arab horsemen accosting\neach other on an airing in the Desert. To them, I suppose, the great\nAtlantic Ocean was a puddle.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nAT DEAD OF NIGHT HE IS SENT UP TO LOOSE THE MAIN-SKYSAIL\nI must now run back a little, and tell of my first going aloft at\nmiddle watch, when the sea was quite calm, and the breeze was mild.\nThe order was given to loose the _main-skysail,_ which is the fifth and\nhighest sail from deck. It was a very small sail, and from the\nforecastle looked no bigger than a cambric pocket-handkerchief. But I\nhave heard that some ships carry still smaller sails, above the\nskysail; called _moon-sails,_ and _skyscrapers,_ and _cloud-rakers._\nBut I shall not believe in them till I see them; a _skysail_ seems high\nenough in all conscience; and the idea of any thing higher than that,\nseems preposterous. Besides, it looks almost like tempting heaven, to\nbrush the very firmament so, and almost put the eyes of the stars out;\nwhen a flaw of wind, too, might very soon take the conceit out of these\ncloud-defying _cloud-rakers._\nNow, when the order was passed to loose the skysail, an old Dutch\nsailor came up to me, and said, \u201cButtons, my boy, it\u2019s high time you be\ndoing something; and it\u2019s boy\u2019s business, Buttons, to loose de royals,\nand not old men\u2019s business, like me. Now, d\u2019ye see dat leelle fellow\nway up dare? _dare,_ just behind dem stars dare: well, tumble up, now,\nButtons, I zay, and looze him; way you go, Buttons.\u201d\nAll the rest joining in, and seeming unanimous in the opinion, that it\nwas high time for me to be stirring myself, and doing _boy\u2019s business,_\nas they called it, I made no more ado, but jumped into the rigging. Up\nI went, not daring to look down, but keeping my eyes glued, as it were,\nto the shrouds, as I ascended.\nIt was a long road up those stairs, and I began to pant and breathe\nhard, before I was half way. But I kept at it till I got to the\n_Jacob\u2019s Ladder;_ and they may well call it so, for it took me almost\ninto the clouds; and at last, to my own amazement, I found myself\nhanging on the skysail-yard, holding on might and main to the mast; and\ncurling my feet round the rigging, as if they were another pair of\nhands.\nFor a few moments I stood awe-stricken and mute. I could not see far\nout upon the ocean, owing to the darkness of the night; and from my\nlofty perch, the sea looked like a great, black gulf, hemmed in, all\nround, by beetling black cliffs. I seemed all alone; treading the\nmidnight clouds; and every second, expected to find myself\nfalling\u2014falling\u2014falling, as I have felt when the nightmare has been on\nme.\nI could but just perceive the ship below me, like a long narrow plank\nin the water; and it did not seem to belong at all to the yard, over\nwhich I was hanging. A gull, or some sort of sea-fowl, was flying round\nthe truck over my head, within a few yards of my face; and it almost\nfrightened me to hear it; it seemed so much like a spirit, at such a\nlofty and solitary height.\nThough there was a pretty smooth sea, and little wind; yet, at this\nextreme elevation, the ship\u2019s motion was very great; so that when the\nship rolled one way, I felt something as a fly must feel, walking the\nceiling; and when it rolled the other way, I felt as if I was hanging\nalong a slanting pine-tree.\nBut presently I heard a distant, hoarse noise from below; and though I\ncould not make out any thing intelligible, I knew it was the mate\nhurrying me. So in a nervous, trembling desperation, I went to casting\noff the _gaskets,_ or lines tying up the sail; and when all was ready,\nsung out as I had been told, to _\u201choist away!\u201d_ And hoist they did, and\nme too along with the yard and sail; for I had no time to get off, they\nwere so unexpectedly quick about it. It seemed like magic; there I was,\ngoing up higher and higher; the yard rising under me, as if it were\nalive, and no soul in sight. Without knowing it at the time, I was in a\ngood deal of danger, but it was so dark that I could not see well\nenough to feel afraid\u2014at least on that account; though I felt\nfrightened enough in a promiscuous way. I only held on hard, and made\ngood the saying of old sailors, that the last person to fall overboard\nfrom the rigging is a landsman, because he grips the ropes so fiercely;\nwhereas old tars are less careful, and sometimes pay the penalty.\nAfter this feat, I got down rapidly on deck, and received something\nlike a compliment from Max the Dutchman.\nThis man was perhaps the best natured man among the crew; at any rate,\nhe treated me better than the rest did; and for that reason he deserves\nsome mention.\nMax was an old bachelor of a sailor, very precise about his wardrobe,\nand prided himself greatly upon his seamanship, and entertained some\nstraight-laced, old-fashioned notions about the duties of boys at sea.\nHis hair, whiskers, and cheeks were of a fiery red; and as he wore a\nred shirt, he was altogether the most combustible looking man I ever\nsaw.\nNor did his appearance belie him; for his temper was very inflammable;\nand at a word, he would explode in a shower of hard words and\nimprecations. It was Max that several times set on foot those\nconspiracies against Jackson, which I have spoken of before; but he\nended by paying him a grumbling homage, full of resentful reservations.\nMax sometimes manifested some little interest in my welfare; and often\ndiscoursed concerning the sorry figure I would cut in my tatters when\nwe got to Liverpool, and the discredit it would bring on the American\nMerchant Service; for like all European seamen in American ships, Max\nprided himself not a little upon his naturalization as a Yankee, and if\nhe could, would have been very glad to have passed himself off for a\nborn native.\nBut notwithstanding his grief at the prospect of my reflecting\ndiscredit upon his adopted country, he never offered to better my\nwardrobe, by loaning me any thing from his own well-stored chest. Like\nmany other well-wishers, he contented him with sympathy. Max also\nbetrayed some anxiety to know whether I knew how to dance; lest, when\nthe ship\u2019s company went ashore, I should disgrace them by exposing my\nawkwardness in some of the sailor saloons. But I relieved his anxiety\non that head.\nHe was a great scold, and fault-finder, and often took me to task about\nmy short-comings; but herein, he was not alone; for every one had a\nfinger, or a thumb, and sometimes both hands, in my unfortunate pie.\nCHAPTER XVII.\nTHE COOK AND STEWARD\nIt was on a Sunday we made the Banks of Newfoundland; a drizzling,\nfoggy, clammy Sunday. You could hardly see the water, owing to the mist\nand vapor upon it; and every thing was so flat and calm, I almost\nthought we must have somehow got back to New York, and were lying at\nthe foot of Wall-street again in a rainy twilight. The decks were\ndripping with wet, so that in the dense fog, it seemed as if we were\nstanding on the roof of a house in a shower.\nIt was a most miserable Sunday; and several of the sailors had twinges\nof the rheumatism, and pulled on their monkey-jackets. As for Jackson,\nhe was all the time rubbing his back and snarling like a dog.\nI tried to recall all my pleasant, sunny Sundays ashore; and tried to\nimagine what they were doing at home; and whether our old family\nfriend, Mr. Bridenstoke, would drop in, with his silver-mounted\ntasseled cane, between churches, as he used to; and whether he would\ninquire about myself.\nBut it would not do. I could hardly realize that it was Sunday at all.\nEvery thing went on pretty much the same as before. There was no church\nto go to; no place to take a walk in; no friend to call upon. I began\nto think it must be a sort of second Saturday; a foggy Saturday, when\nschool-boys stay at home reading Robinson Crusoe.\nThe only man who seemed to be taking his ease that day, was our black\ncook; who according to the invariable custom at sea, always went by the\nname of _the doctor._\nAnd _doctors,_ cooks certainly are, the very best medicos in the world;\nfor what pestilent pills and potions of the Faculty are half so\nserviceable to man, and health-and-strength-giving, as roasted lamb and\ngreen peas, say, in spring; and roast beef and cranberry sauce in\nwinter? Will a dose of calomel and jalap do you as much good? Will a\nbolus build up a fainting man? Is there any satisfaction in dining off\na powder? But these doctors of the frying-pan sometimes loll men off by\na surfeit; or give them the headache, at least. Well, what then? No\nmatter. For if with their most goodly and ten times jolly medicines,\nthey now and then fill our nights with tribulations, and abridge our\ndays, what of the social homicides perpetrated by the Faculty? And when\nyou die by a pill-doctor\u2019s hands, it is never with a sweet relish in\nyour mouth, as though you died by a frying-pan-doctor; but your last\nbreath villainously savors of ipecac and rhubarb. Then, what charges\nthey make for the abominable lunches they serve out so stingily! One of\ntheir bills for boluses would keep you in good dinners a twelve-month.\nNow, our doctor was a serious old fellow, much given to metaphysics,\nand used to talk about original sin. All that Sunday morning, he sat\nover his boiling pots, reading out of a book which was very much soiled\nand covered with grease spots: for he kept it stuck into a little\nleather strap, nailed to the keg where he kept the fat skimmed off the\nwater in which the salt beef was cooked. I could hardly believe my eyes\nwhen I found this book was the Bible.\nI loved to peep in upon him, when he was thus absorbed; for his smoky\nstudio or study was a strange-looking place enough; not more than five\nfeet square, and about as many high; a mere box to hold the stove, the\npipe of which stuck out of the roof.\nWithin, it was hung round with pots and pans; and on one side was a\nlittle looking-glass, where he used to shave; and on a small shelf were\nhis shaving tools, and a comb and brush. Fronting the stove, and very\nclose to it, was a sort of narrow shelf, where he used to sit with his\nlegs spread out very wide, to keep them from scorching; and there, with\nhis book in one hand, and a pewter spoon in the other, he sat all that\nSunday morning, stirring up his pots, and studying away at the same\ntime; seldom taking his eye off the page. Reading must have been very\nhard work for him; for he muttered to himself quite loud as he read;\nand big drops of sweat would stand upon his brow, and roll off, till\nthey hissed on the hot stove before him. But on the day I speak of, it\nwas no wonder that he got perplexed, for he was reading a mysterious\npassage in the Book of Chronicles. Being aware that I knew how to read,\nhe called me as I was passing his premises, and read the passage over,\ndemanding an explanation. I told him it was a mystery that no one could\nexplain; not even a parson. But this did not satisfy him, and I left\nhim poring over it still.\nHe must have been a member of one of those negro churches, which are to\nbe found in New York. For when we lay at the wharf, I remembered that a\ncommittee of three reverend looking old darkies, who, besides their\nnatural canonicals, wore quaker-cut black coats, and broad-brimmed\nblack hats, and white neck-cloths; these colored gentlemen called upon\nhim, and remained conversing with him at his cookhouse door for more\nthan an hour; and before they went away they stepped inside, and the\nsliding doors were closed; and then we heard some one reading aloud and\npreaching; and after that a psalm was sung and a benediction given;\nwhen the door opened again, and the congregation came out in a great\nperspiration; owing, I suppose, to the chapel being so small, and there\nbeing only one seat besides the stove.\nBut notwithstanding his religious studies and meditations, this old\nfellow used to use some bad language occasionally; particularly of\ncold, wet stormy mornings, when he had to get up before daylight and\nmake his fire; with the sea breaking over the bows, and now and then\ndashing into his stove.\nSo, under the circumstances, you could not blame him much, if he did\nrip a little, for it would have tried old Job\u2019s temper, to be set to\nwork making a fire in the water.\nWithout being at all neat about his premises, this old cook was very\nparticular about them; he had a warm love and affection for his\ncook-house. In fair weather, he spread the skirt of an old jacket\nbefore the door, by way of a mat; and screwed a small ring-bolt into\nthe door for a knocker; and wrote his name, \u201cMr. Thompson,\u201d over it,\nwith a bit of red chalk.\nThe men said he lived round the corner of _Forecastle-square,_ opposite\nthe _Liberty Pole;_ because his cook-house was right behind the\nforemast, and very near the quarters occupied by themselves.\nSailors have a great fancy for naming things that way on shipboard.\nWhen a man is hung at sea, which is always done from one of the lower\nyard-arms, they say he _\u201ctakes a walk up Ladder-lane, and down\nHemp-street.\u201d_\nMr. Thompson was a great crony of the steward\u2019s, who, being a handsome,\ndandy mulatto, that had once been a barber in West-Broadway, went by\nthe name of Lavender. I have mentioned the gorgeous turban he wore when\nMr. Jones and I visited the captain in the cabin. He never wore that\nturban at sea, though; but sported an uncommon head of frizzled hair,\njust like the large, round brush, used for washing windows, called a\n_Pope\u2019s Head._\nHe kept it well perfumed with Cologne water, of which he had a large\nsupply, the relics of his West-Broadway stock in trade. His clothes,\nbeing mostly cast-off suits of the captain of a London liner, whom he\nhad sailed with upon many previous voyages, were all in the height of\nthe exploded fashions, and of every kind of color and cut. He had\nclaret-colored suits, and snuff-colored suits, and red velvet vests,\nand buff and brimstone pantaloons, and several full suits of black,\nwhich, with his dark-colored face, made him look quite clerical; like a\nserious young colored gentleman of Barbados, about to take orders.\nHe wore an uncommon large pursy ring on his forefinger, with something\nhe called a real diamond in it; though it was very dim, and looked more\nlike a glass eye than any thing else. He was very proud of his ring,\nand was always calling your attention to something, and pointing at it\nwith his ornamented finger.\nHe was a sentimental sort of a darky, and read the _\u201cThree Spaniards,\u201d_\nand _\u201cCharlotte Temple,\u201d_ and carried a lock of frizzled hair in his\nvest pocket, which he frequently volunteered to show to people, with\nhis handkerchief to his eyes. Every fine evening, about sunset, these\ntwo, the cook and steward, used to sit on the little shelf in the\ncook-house, leaning up against each other like the Siamese twins, to\nkeep from falling off, for the shelf was very short; and there they\nwould stay till after dark, smoking their pipes, and gossiping about\nthe events that had happened during the day in the cabin.\nAnd sometimes Mr. Thompson would take down his Bible, and read a\nchapter for the edification of Lavender, whom he knew to be a sad\nprofligate and gay deceiver ashore; addicted to every youthful\nindiscretion. He would read over to him the story of Joseph and\nPotiphar\u2019s wife; and hold Joseph up to him as a young man of excellent\nprinciples, whom he ought to imitate, and not be guilty of his\nindiscretion any more. And Lavender would look serious, and say that he\nknew it was all true\u2014he was a wicked youth, he knew it\u2014he had broken a\ngood many hearts, and many eyes were weeping for him even then, both in\nNew York, and Liverpool, and London, and Havre. But how could he help\nit? He hadn\u2019t made his handsome face, and fine head of hair, and\ngraceful figure. It was not _he,_ but the others, that were to blame;\nfor his bewitching person turned all heads and subdued all hearts,\nwherever he went. And then he would look very serious and penitent, and\ngo up to the little glass, and pass his hands through his hair, and see\nhow his whiskers were coming on.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\nHE ENDEAVORS TO IMPROVE HIS MIND; AND TELLS OF ONE BLUNT AND HIS DREAM\nBOOK\nOn the Sunday afternoon I spoke of, it was my watch below, and I\nthought I would spend it profitably, in improving my mind.\nMy bunk was an upper one; and right over the head of it was a\n_bull\u2019s-eye,_ or circular piece of thick ground glass, inserted into\nthe deck to give light. It was a dull, dubious light, though; and I\noften found myself looking up anxiously to see whether the bull\u2019s-eye\nhad not suddenly been put out; for whenever any one trod on it, in\nwalking the deck, it was momentarily quenched; and what was still\nworse, sometimes a coil of rope would be thrown down on it, and stay\nthere till I dressed myself and went up to remove it\u2014a kind of\ninterruption to my studies which annoyed me very much, when diligently\noccupied in reading.\nHowever, I was glad of any light at all, down in that gloomy hole,\nwhere we burrowed like rabbits in a warren; and it was the happiest\ntime I had, when all my messmates were asleep, and I could lie on my\nback, during a forenoon watch below, and read in comparative quiet and\nseclusion.\nI had already read two books loaned to me by Max, to whose share they\nhad fallen, in dividing the effects of the sailor who had jumped\noverboard. One was an account of Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea, and\nthe other was a large black volume, with _Delirium Tremens_ in great\ngilt letters on the back. This proved to be a popular treatise on the\nsubject of that disease; and I remembered seeing several copies in the\nsailor book-stalls about Fulton Market, and along South-street, in New\nYork.\nBut this Sunday I got out a book, from which I expected to reap great\nprofit and sound instruction. It had been presented to me by Mr. Jones,\nwho had quite a library, and took down this book from a top shelf,\nwhere it lay very dusty. When he gave it to me, he said, that although\nI was going to sea, I must not forget the importance of a good\neducation; and that there was hardly any situation in life, however\nhumble and depressed, or dark and gloomy, but one might find leisure in\nit to store his mind, and build himself up in the exact sciences. And\nhe added, that though it _did_ look rather unfavorable for my future\nprospects, to be going to sea as a common sailor so early in life; yet,\nit would no doubt turn out for my benefit in the end; and, at any rate,\nif I would only take good care of myself, would give me a sound\nconstitution, if nothing more; and _that_ was not to be undervalued,\nfor how many very rich men would give all their bonds and mortgages for\nmy boyish robustness.\nHe added, that I need not expect any light, trivial work, that was\nmerely entertaining, and nothing more; but here I would find\nentertainment and edification beautifully and harmoniously combined;\nand though, at first, I might possibly find it dull, yet, if I perused\nthe book thoroughly, it would soon discover hidden charms and\nunforeseen attractions; besides teaching me, perhaps, the true way to\nretrieve the poverty of my family, and again make them all well-to-do\nin the world.\nSaying this, he handed it to me, and I blew the dust off, and looked at\nthe back: _\u201cSmith\u2019s Wealth of Nations.\u201d_ This not satisfying me, I\nglanced at the title page, and found it was an _\u201cEnquiry into the\nNature and Causes\u201d_ of the alleged wealth of nations. But happening to\nlook further down, I caught sight of _\u201cAberdeen,\u201d_ where the book was\nprinted; and thinking that any thing from Scotland, a foreign country,\nmust prove some way or other pleasing to me, I thanked Mr. Jones very\nkindly, and promised to peruse the volume carefully.\nSo, now, lying in my bunk, I began the book methodically, at page\nnumber one, resolved not to permit a few flying glimpses into it, taken\npreviously, to prevent me from making regular approaches to the gist\nand body of the book, where I fancied lay something like the\nphilosopher\u2019s stone, a secret talisman, which would transmute even\npitch and tar to silver and gold.\nPleasant, though vague visions of future opulence floated before me, as\nI commenced the first chapter, entitled _\u201cOf the causes of improvement\nin the productive power of labor.\u201d_ Dry as crackers and cheese, to be\nsure; and the chapter itself was not much better. But this was only\ngetting initiated; and if I read on, the grand secret would be opened\nto me. So I read on and on, about _\u201cwages and profits of labor,\u201d_\nwithout getting any profits myself for my pains in perusing it.\nDryer and dryer; the very leaves smelt of saw-dust; till at last I\ndrank some water, and went at it again. But soon I had to give it up\nfor lost work; and thought that the old backgammon board, we had at\nhome, lettered on the back, _\u201cThe History of Rome\u201d_ was quite as full\nof matter, and a great deal more entertaining. I wondered whether Mr.\nJones had ever read the volume himself; and could not help remembering,\nthat he had to get on a chair when he reached it down from its dusty\nshelf; _that_ certainly looked suspicious.\nThe best reading was on the fly leaves; and, on turning them over, I\nlighted upon some half effaced pencil-marks to the following effect:\n_\u201cJonathan Jones, from his particular friend Daniel Dods,_ 1798.\u201d So it\nmust have originally belonged to Mr. Jones\u2019 father; and I wondered\nwhether _he_ had ever read it; or, indeed, whether any body had ever\nread it, even the author himself; but then authors, they say, never\nread their own books; writing them, being enough in all conscience.\nAt length I fell asleep, with the volume in my hand; and never slept so\nsound before; after that, I used to wrap my jacket round it, and use it\nfor a pillow; for which purpose it answered very well; only I sometimes\nwaked up feeling dull and stupid; but of course the book could not have\nbeen the cause of that.\nAnd now I am talking of books, I must tell of Jack Blunt the sailor,\nand his Dream Book.\nJackson, who seemed to know every thing about all parts of the world,\nused to tell Jack in reproach, that he was an _Irish Cockney._ By which\nI understood, that he was an Irishman born, but had graduated in\nLondon, somewhere about Radcliffe Highway; but he had no sort of brogue\nthat I could hear.\nHe was a curious looking fellow, about twenty-five years old, as I\nshould judge; but to look at his back, you would have taken him for a\nlittle old man. His arms and legs were very large, round, short, and\nstumpy; so that when he had on his great monkey-jacket, and sou\u2019west\ncap flapping in his face, and his sea boots drawn up to his knees, he\nlooked like a fat porpoise, standing on end. He had a round face, too,\nlike a walrus; and with about the same expression, half human and half\nindescribable. He was, upon the whole, a good-natured fellow, and a\nlittle given to looking at sea-life romantically; singing songs about\nsusceptible mermaids who fell in love with handsome young oyster boys\nand gallant fishermen. And he had a sad story about a man-of-war\u2019s-man\nwho broke his heart at Portsmouth during the late war, and threw away\nhis life recklessly at one of the quarter-deck cannonades, in the\nbattle between the Guerriere and Constitution; and another\nincomprehensible story about a sort of fairy sea-queen, who used to be\ndunning a sea-captain all the time for his autograph to boil in some\neel soup, for a spell against the scurvy.\nHe believed in all kinds of witch-work and magic; and had some wild\nIrish words he used to mutter over during a calm for a fair wind.\nAnd he frequently related his interviews in Liverpool with a\nfortune-teller, an old negro woman by the name of De Squak, whose house\nwas much frequented by sailors; and how she had two black cats, with\nremarkably green eyes, and nightcaps on their heads, solemnly seated on\na claw-footed table near the old goblin; when she felt his pulse, to\ntell what was going to befall him.\nThis Blunt had a large head of hair, very thick and bushy; but from\nsome cause or other, it was rapidly turning gray; and in its transition\nstate made him look as if he wore a shako of badger skin.\nThe phenomenon of gray hairs on a young head, had perplexed and\nconfounded this Blunt to such a degree that he at last came to the\nconclusion it must be the result of the black art, wrought upon him by\nan enemy; and that enemy, he opined, was an old sailor landlord in\nMarseilles, whom he had once seriously offended, by knocking him down\nin a fray.\nSo while in New York, finding his hair growing grayer and grayer, and\nall his friends, the ladies and others, laughing at him, and calling\nhim an old man with one foot in the grave, he slipt out one night to an\napothecary\u2019s, stated his case, and wanted to know what could be done\nfor him.\nThe apothecary immediately gave him a pint bottle of something he\ncalled _\u201cTrafalgar Oil_ for restoring the hair,\u201d _price one dollar;_\nand told him that after he had used that bottle, and it did not have\nthe desired effect, he must try bottle No. 2, called _\u201cBalm of\nParadise, or the Elixir of the Battle of Copenhagen.\u201d_ These\nhigh-sounding naval names delighted Blunt, and he had no doubt there\nmust be virtue in them.\nI saw both bottles; and on one of them was an engraving, representing a\nyoung man, presumed to be gray-headed, standing in his night-dress in\nthe middle of his chamber, and with closed eyes applying the Elixir to\nhis head, with both hands; while on the bed adjacent stood a large\nbottle, conspicuously labeled, _\u201cBalm of Paradise.\u201d_ It seemed from the\ntext, that this gray-headed young man was so smitten with his hair-oil,\nand was so thoroughly persuaded of its virtues, that he had got out of\nbed, even in his sleep; groped into his closet, seized the precious\nbottle, applied its contents, and then to bed again, getting up in the\nmorning without knowing any thing about it. Which, indeed, was a most\nmysterious occurrence; and it was still more mysterious, how the\nengraver came to know an event, of which the actor himself was\nignorant, and where there were no bystanders.\nThree times in the twenty-four hours, Blunt, while at sea, regularly\nrubbed in his liniments; but though the first bottle was soon exhausted\nby his copious applications, and the second half gone, he still stuck\nto it, that by the time we got to Liverpool, his exertions would be\ncrowned with success. And he was not a little delighted, that this\ngradual change would be operating while we were at sea; so as not to\nexpose him to the invidious observations of people ashore; on the same\nprinciple that dandies go into the country when they purpose raising\nwhiskers. He would often ask his shipmates, whether they noticed any\nchange yet; and if so, how much of a change? And to tell the truth,\nthere was a very great change indeed; for the constant soaking of his\nhair with oil, operating in conjunction with the neglect of his toilet,\nand want of a brush and comb, had matted his locks together like a wild\nhorse\u2019s mane, and imparted to it a blackish and extremely glossy hue.\nBesides his collection of hair-oils, Blunt had also provided himself\nwith several boxes of pills, which he had purchased from a sailor\ndoctor in New York, who by placards stuck on the posts along the\nwharves, advertised to remain standing at the northeast corner of\nCatharine Market, every Monday and Friday, between the hours of ten and\ntwelve in the morning, to receive calls from patients, distribute\nmedicines, and give advice gratis.\nWhether Blunt thought he had the dyspepsia or not, I can not say; but\nat breakfast, he always took three pills with his coffee; something as\nthey do in Iowa, when the bilious fever prevails; where, at the\nboarding-houses, they put a vial of blue pills into the castor, along\nwith the pepper and mustard, and next door to another vial of\ntoothpicks. But they are very ill-bred and unpolished in the western\ncountry.\nSeveral times, too, Blunt treated himself to a flowing bumper of _horse\nsalts_ (Glauber salts); for like many other seamen, he never went to\nsea without a good supply of that luxury. He would frequently, also,\ntake this medicine in a wet jacket, and then go on deck into a rain\nstorm. But this is nothing to other sailors, who at sea will doctor\nthemselves with calomel off Cape Horn, and still remain on duty. And in\nthis connection, some really frightful stories might be told; but I\nforbear.\nFor a landsman to take salts as this Blunt did, it would perhaps be the\ndeath of him; but at sea the salt air and the salt water prevent you\nfrom catching cold so readily as on land; and for my own part, on board\nthis very ship, being so illy-provided with clothes, I frequently\nturned into my bunk soaking wet, and turned out again piping hot, and\nsmoking like a roasted sirloin; and yet was never the worse for it; for\nthen, I bore a charmed life of youth and health, and was dagger-proof\nto bodily ill.\nBut it is time to tell of the Dream Book. Snugly hidden in one corner\nof his chest, Blunt had an extraordinary looking pamphlet, with a red\ncover, marked all over with astrological signs and ciphers, and\npurporting to be a full and complete treatise on the art of Divination;\nso that the most simple sailor could teach it to himself.\nIt also purported to be the selfsame system, by aid of which Napoleon\nBonaparte had risen in the world from being a corporal to an emperor.\nHence it was entitled the _Bonaparte Dream Book;_ for the magic of it\nlay in the interpretation of dreams, and their application to the\nforeseeing of future events; so that all preparatory measures might be\ntaken beforehand; which would be exceedingly convenient, and\nsatisfactory every way, if true. The problems were to be cast by means\nof figures, in some perplexed and difficult way, which, however, was\nfacilitated by a set of tables in the end of the pamphlet, something\nlike the Logarithm Tables at the end of Bowditch\u2019s Navigator.\nNow, Blunt revered, adored, and worshiped this _Bonaparte Dream Book_\nof his; and was fully persuaded that between those red covers, and in\nhis own dreams, lay all the secrets of futurity. Every morning before\ntaking his pills, and applying his hair-oils, he would steal out of his\nbunk before the rest of the watch were awake; take out his pamphlet,\nand a bit of chalk; and then straddling his chest, begin scratching his\noily head to remember his fugitive dreams; marking down strokes on his\nchest-lid, as if he were casting up his daily accounts.\nThough often perplexed and lost in mazes concerning the cabalistic\nfigures in the book, and the chapter of directions to beginners; for he\ncould with difficulty read at all; yet, in the end, if not interrupted,\nhe somehow managed to arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to him. So\nthat, as he generally wore a good-humored expression, no doubt he must\nhave thought, that all his future affairs were working together for the\nbest.\nBut one night he started us all up in a fright, by springing from his\nbunk, his eyes ready to start out of his head, and crying, in a husky\nvoice\u2014\u201cBoys! boys! get the benches ready! Quick, quick!\u201d\n\u201cWhat benches?\u201d growled Max\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cBenches! benches!\u201d screamed Blunt, without heeding him, \u201ccut down the\nforests, bear a hand, boys; the Day of Judgment\u2019s coming!\u201d\nBut the next moment, he got quietly into his bunk, and laid still,\nmuttering to himself, he had only been rambling in his sleep.\nI did not know exactly what he had meant by his _benches;_ till,\nshortly after, I overheard two of the sailors debating, whether mankind\nwould stand or sit at the Last Day.\nCHAPTER XIX.\nA NARROW ESCAPE\nThis Dream Book of Blunt\u2019s reminds me of a narrow escape we had, early\none morning.\nIt was the larboard watch\u2019s turn to remain below from midnight till\nfour o\u2019clock; and having turned in and slept, Blunt suddenly turned out\nagain about three o\u2019clock, with a wonderful dream in his head; which he\nwas desirous of at once having interpreted.\nSo he goes to his chest, gets out his tools, and falls to ciphering on\nthe lid. When, all at once, a terrible cry was heard, that routed him\nand all the rest of us up, and sent the whole ship\u2019s company flying on\ndeck in the dark. We did not know what it was; but somehow, among\nsailors at sea, they seem to know when real danger of any land is at\nhand, even in their sleep.\nWhen we got on deck, we saw the mate standing on the bowsprit, and\ncrying out _Luff! Luff!_ to some one in the dark water before the ship.\nIn that direction, we could just see a light, and then, the great black\nhull of a strange vessel, that was coming down on us obliquely; and so\nnear, that we heard the flap of her topsails as they shook in the wind,\nthe trampling of feet on the deck, and the same cry of _Luff! Luff!_\nthat our own mate, was raising.\nIn a minute more, I caught my breath, as I heard a snap and a crash,\nlike the fall of a tree, and suddenly, one of our flying-jib guys\njerked out the bolt near the cat-head; and presently, we heard our\njib-boom thumping against our bows.\nMeantime, the strange ship, scraping by us thus, shot off into the\ndarkness, and we saw her no more. But she, also, must have been\ninjured; for when it grew light, we found pieces of strange rigging\nmixed with ours. We repaired the damage, and replaced the broken spar\nwith another jib-boom we had; for all ships carry spare spars against\nemergencies.\nThe cause of this accident, which came near being the death of all on\nboard, was nothing but the drowsiness of the look-out men on the\nforecastles of both ships. The sailor who had the look-out on our\nvessel was terribly reprimanded by the mate.\nNo doubt, many ships that are never heard of after leaving port, meet\ntheir fate in this way; and it may be, that sometimes two vessels\ncoming together, jib-boom-and-jib-boom, with a sudden shock in the\nmiddle watch of the night, mutually destroy each other; and like\nfighting elks, sink down into the ocean, with their antlers locked in\ndeath.\nWhile I was at Liverpool, a fine ship that lay near us in the docks,\nhaving got her cargo on board, went to sea, bound for India, with a\ngood breeze; and all her crew felt sure of a prosperous voyage. But in\nabout seven days after, she came back, a most distressing object to\nbehold. All her starboard side was torn and splintered; her starboard\nanchor was gone; and a great part of the starboard bulwarks; while\nevery one of the lower yard-arms had been broken, in the same\ndirection; so that she now carried small and unsightly _jury-yards._\nWhen I looked at this vessel, with the whole of one side thus\nshattered, but the other still in fine trim; and when I remembered her\ngay and gallant appearance, when she left the same harbor into which\nshe now entered so forlorn; I could not help thinking of a young man I\nhad known at home, who had left his cottage one morning in high\nspirits, and was brought back at noon with his right side paralyzed\nfrom head to foot.\nIt seems that this vessel had been run against by a strange ship,\ncrowding all sail before a fresh breeze; and the stranger had rushed\npast her starboard side, reducing her to the sad state in which she now\nwas.\nSailors can not be too wakeful and cautious, when keeping their night\nlook-outs; though, as I well know, they too often suffer themselves to\nbecome negligent, and nod. And this is not so wonderful, after all; for\nthough every seaman has heard of those accidents at sea; and many of\nthem, perhaps, have been in ships that have suffered from them; yet,\nwhen you find yourself sailing along on the ocean at night, without\nhaving seen a sail for weeks and weeks, it is hard for you to realize\nthat any are near. Then, if they _are_ near, it seems almost incredible\nthat on the broad, boundless sea, which washes Greenland at one end of\nthe world, and the Falkland Islands at the other, that any one vessel\nupon such a vast highway, should come into close contact with another.\nBut the likelihood of great calamities occurring, seldom obtrudes upon\nthe minds of ignorant men, such as sailors generally are; for the\nthings which wise people know, anticipate, and guard against, the\nignorant can only become acquainted with, by meeting them face to face.\nAnd even when experience has taught them, the lesson only serves for\nthat day; inasmuch as the foolish in prosperity are infidels to the\npossibility of adversity; they see the sun in heaven, and believe it to\nbe far too bright ever to set. And even, as suddenly as the bravest and\nfleetest ships, while careering in pride of canvas over the sea, have\nbeen struck, as by lightning, and quenched out of sight; even so, do\nsome lordly men, with all their plans and prospects gallantly trimmed\nto the fair, rushing breeze of life, and with no thought of death and\ndisaster, suddenly encounter a shock unforeseen, and go down,\nfoundering, into death.\nCHAPTER XX.\nIN A FOG HE IS SET TO WORK AS A BELL-TOLLER, AND BEHOLDS A HERD OF\nOCEAN-ELEPHANTS\nWhat is this that we sail through? What palpable obscure? What smoke\nand reek, as if the whole steaming world were revolving on its axis, as\na spit?\nIt is a Newfoundland Fog; and we are yet crossing the Grand Banks,\nwrapt in a mist, that no London in the Novemberest November ever\nequaled. The chronometer pronounced it noon; but do you call this\nmidnight or midday? So dense is the fog, that though we have a fair\nwind, we shorten sail for fear of accidents; and not only that, but\nhere am I, poor Wellingborough, mounted aloft on a sort of belfry, the\ntop of the _\u201cSampson-Post,\u201d_ a lofty tower of timber, so called; and\ntolling the ship\u2019s bell, as if for a funeral.\nThis is intended to proclaim our approach, and warn all strangers from\nour track.\nDreary sound! toll, toll, toll, through the dismal mist and fog.\nThe bell is green with verdigris, and damp with dew; and the little\ncord attached to the clapper, by which I toll it, now and then slides\nthrough my fingers, slippery with wet. Here I am, in my slouched black\nhat, like the _\u201cbull that could pull,\u201d_ announcing the decease of the\nlamented Cock-Robin.\nA better device than the bell, however, was once pitched upon by an\ningenious sea-captain, of whom I have heard. He had a litter of young\nporkers on board; and while sailing through the fog, he stationed men\nat both ends of the pen with long poles, wherewith they incessantly\nstirred up and irritated the porkers, who split the air with their\nsqueals; and no doubt saved the ship, as the geese saved the Capitol.\nThe most strange and unheard-of noises came out of the fog at times: a\nvast sound of sighing and sobbing. What could it be? This would be\nfollowed by a spout, and a gush, and a cascading commotion, as if some\nfountain had suddenly jetted out of the ocean.\nSeated on my Sampson-Post, I stared more and more, and suspended my\nduty as a sexton. But presently some one cried out\u2014_\u201cThere she blows!\nwhales! whales close alongside!\u201d_\nA whale! Think of it! whales close to _me,_ Wellingborough;\u2014 would my\nown brother believe it? I dropt the clapper as if it were red-hot, and\nrushed to the side; and there, dimly floating, lay four or five long,\nblack snaky-looking shapes, only a few inches out of the water.\nCan these be whales? Monstrous whales, such as I had heard of? I\nthought they would look like mountains on the sea; hills and valleys of\nflesh! regular krakens, that made it high tide, and inundated\ncontinents, when they descended to feed!\nIt was a bitter disappointment, from which I was long in recovering. I\nlost all respect for whales; and began to be a little dubious about the\nstory of Jonah; for how could Jonah reside in such an insignificant\ntenement; how could he have had elbow-room there? But perhaps, thought\nI, the whale which according to Rabbinical traditions was a female one,\nmight have expanded to receive him like an anaconda, when it swallows\nan elk and leaves the antlers sticking out of its mouth.\nNevertheless, from that day, whales greatly fell in my estimation.\nBut it is always thus. If you read of St. Peter\u2019s, they say, and then\ngo and visit it, ten to one, you account it a dwarf compared to your\nhigh-raised ideal. And, doubtless, Jonah himself must have been\ndisappointed when he looked up to the domed midriff surmounting the\nwhale\u2019s belly, and surveyed the ribbed pillars around him. A pretty\nlarge belly, to be sure, thought he, but not so big as it might have\nbeen.\nOn the next day, the fog lifted; and by noon, we found ourselves\nsailing through fleets of fishermen at anchor. They were very small\ncraft; and when I beheld them, I perceived the force of that sailor\nsaying, intended to illustrate restricted quarters, or being _on the\nlimits. It is like a fisherman\u2019s walk,_ say they, _three steps and\noverboard._\nLying right in the track of the multitudinous ships crossing the ocean\nbetween England and America, these little vessels are sometimes run\ndown, and obliterated from the face of the waters; the cry of the\nsailors ceasing with the last whirl of the whirlpool that closes over\ntheir craft. Their sad fate is frequently the result of their own\nremissness in keeping a good look-out by day, and not having their\nlamps trimmed, like the wise virgins, by night.\nAs I shall not make mention of the Grand Banks on our homeward-bound\npassage, I may as well here relate, that on our return, we approached\nthem in the night; and by way of making sure of our whereabouts, the\ndeep-sea-lead was heaved. The line attached is generally upward of\nthree hundred fathoms in length; and the lead itself, weighing some\nforty or fifty pounds, has a hole in the lower end, in which, previous\nto sounding, some tallow is thrust, that it may bring up the soil at\nthe bottom, for the captain to inspect. This is called \u201carming\u201d the\nlead.\nWe \u201chove\u201d our deep-sea-line by night, and the operation was very\ninteresting, at least to me. In the first place, the vessel\u2019s heading\nwas stopt; then, coiled away in a tub, like a whale-rope, the line was\nplaced toward the after part of the quarter-deck; and one of the\nsailors carried the lead outside of the ship, away along to the end of\nthe jib-boom, and at the word of command, far ahead and overboard it\nwent, with a plunge; scraping by the side, till it came to the stern,\nwhen the line ran out of the tub like light.\nWhen we came to haul _it_ up, I was astonished at the force necessary\nto perform the work. The whole watch pulled at the line, which was rove\nthrough a block in the mizzen-rigging, as if we were hauling up a fat\nporpoise. When the lead came in sight, I was all eagerness to examine\nthe tallow, and get a peep at a specimen of the bottom of the sea; but\nthe sailors did not seem to be much interested by it, calling me a fool\nfor wanting to preserve a few grains of the sand.\nI had almost forgotten to make mention of the Gulf Stream, in which we\nfound ourselves previous to crossing the Banks. The fact of our being\nin it was proved by the captain in person, who superintended the\ndrawing of a bucket of salt water, in which he dipped his thermometer.\nIn the absence of the Gulf-weed, this is the general test; for the\ntemperature of this current is eight degrees higher than that of the\nocean, and the temperature of the ocean is twenty degrees higher than\nthat of the Grand Banks. And it is to this remarkable difference of\ntemperature, for which there can be no equilibrium, that many seamen\nimpute the fogs on the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland; but why\nthere should always be such ugly weather in the Gulf, is something that\nI do not know has ever been accounted for.\nIt is curious to dip one\u2019s finger in a bucket full of the Gulf Stream,\nand find it so warm; as if the Gulf of Mexico, from whence this current\ncomes, were a great caldron or boiler, on purpose to keep warm the\nNorth Atlantic, which is traversed by it for a distance of two thousand\nmiles, as some large halls in winter are by hot air tubes. Its mean\nbreadth being about two hundred leagues, it comprises an area larger\nthan that of the whole Mediterranean, and may be deemed a sort of\nMississippi of hot water flowing through the ocean; off the coast of\nFlorida, running at the rate of one mile and a half an hour.\nCHAPTER XXI.\nA WHALEMAN AND A MAN-OF-WAR\u2019S-MAN\nThe sight of the whales mentioned in the preceding chapter was the\nbringing out of Larry, one of our crew, who hitherto had been quite\nsilent and reserved, as if from some conscious inferiority, though he\nhad shipped as an _ordinary seaman,_ and, for aught I could see,\nperformed his duty very well.\nWhen the men fell into a dispute concerning what kind of whales they\nwere which we saw, Larry stood by attentively, and after garnering in\ntheir ignorance, all at once broke out, and astonished every body by\nhis intimate acquaintance with the monsters.\n\u201cThey ar\u2019n\u2019t sperm whales,\u201d said Larry, \u201ctheir spouts ar\u2019n\u2019t bushy\nenough; they ar\u2019n\u2019t Sulphur-bottoms, or they wouldn\u2019t stay up so long;\nthey ar\u2019n\u2019t Hump-backs, for they ar\u2019n\u2019t got any humps; they ar\u2019n\u2019t\nFin-backs, for you won\u2019t catch a Finback so near a ship; they ar\u2019n\u2019t\nGreenland whales, for we ar\u2019n\u2019t off the coast of Greenland; and they\nar\u2019n\u2019t right whales, for it wouldn\u2019t be right to say so. I tell ye,\nmen, them\u2019s Crinkum-crankum whales.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are them?\u201d said a sailor.\n\u201cWhy, them is whales that can\u2019t be cotched.\u201d\nNow, as it turned out that this Larry had been bred to the sea in a\nwhaler, and had sailed out of Nantucket many times; no one but Jackson\nventured to dispute his opinion; and even Jackson did not press him\nvery hard. And ever after, Larry\u2019s judgment was relied upon concerning\nall strange fish that happened to float by us during the voyage; for\nwhalemen are far more familiar with the wonders of the deep than any\nother class of seaman.\nThis was Larry\u2019s first voyage in the merchant service, and that was the\nreason why, hitherto, he had been so reserved; since he well knew that\nmerchant seamen generally affect a certain superiority to\n_\u201cblubber-boilers,\u201d_ as they contemptuously style those who hunt the\nleviathan. But Larry turned out to be such an inoffensive fellow, and\nso well understood his business aboard ship, and was so ready to jump\nto an order, that he was exempted from the taunts which he might\notherwise have encountered.\nHe was a somewhat singular man, who wore his hat slanting forward over\nthe bridge of his nose, with his eyes cast down, and seemed always\nexamining your boots, when speaking to you. I loved to hear him talk\nabout the wild places in the Indian Ocean, and on the coast of\nMadagascar, where he had frequently touched during his whaling voyages.\nAnd this familiarity with the life of nature led by the people in that\nremote part of the world, had furnished Larry with a sentimental\ndistaste for civilized society. When opportunity offered, he never\nomitted extolling the delights of the free and easy Indian Ocean.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said Larry, talking through his nose, as usual, \u201cin _Madagasky_\nthere, they don\u2019t wear any togs at all, nothing but a bowline round the\nmidships; they don\u2019t have no dinners, but keeps a dinin\u2019 all day off\nfat pigs and dogs; they don\u2019t go to bed any where, but keeps a noddin\u2019\nall the time; and they gets drunk, too, from some first rate arrack\nthey make from cocoa-nuts; and smokes plenty of \u2019baccy, too, I tell ye.\nFine country, that! Blast Ameriky, I say!\u201d\nTo tell the truth, this Larry dealt in some illiberal insinuations\nagainst civilization.\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the use of bein\u2019 _snivelized!\u201d_ said he to me one night\nduring our watch on deck; \u201csnivelized chaps only learns the way to take\non \u2019bout life, and snivel. You don\u2019t see any Methodist chaps feelin\u2019\ndreadful about their souls; you don\u2019t see any darned beggars and pesky\nconstables in _Madagasky, I_ tell ye; and none o\u2019 them kings there gets\ntheir big toes pinched by the gout. Blast Ameriky, I say.\u201d\nIndeed, this Larry was rather cutting in his innuendoes.\n\u201cAre _you_ now, Buttons, any better off for bein\u2019 snivelized?\u201d coming\nclose up to me and eying the wreck of my gaff-topsail-boots very\nsteadfastly. \u201cNo; you ar\u2019n\u2019t a bit\u2014but you\u2019re a good deal _worse_ for\nit, Buttons. I tell ye, ye wouldn\u2019t have been to sea here, leadin\u2019 this\ndog\u2019s life, if you hadn\u2019t been snivelized\u2014that\u2019s the cause why, now.\nSnivelization has been the ruin on ye; and it\u2019s spiled me complete; I\nmight have been a great man in Madagasky; it\u2019s too darned bad! Blast\nAmeriky, I say.\u201d And in bitter grief at the social blight upon his\nwhole past, present, and future, Larry turned away, pulling his hat\nstill lower down over the bridge of his nose.\nIn strong contrast to Larry, was a young man-of-war\u2019s man we had, who\nwent by the name of _\u201cGun-Deck,\u201d_ from his always talking of sailor\nlife in the navy. He was a little fellow with a small face and a\nprodigious mop of brown hair; who always dressed in man-of-war style,\nwith a wide, braided collar to his frock, and Turkish trowsers. But he\nparticularly prided himself upon his feet, which were quite small; and\nwhen we washed down decks of a morning, never mind how chilly it might\nbe, he always took off his boots, and went paddling about like a duck,\nturning out his pretty toes to show his charming feet.\nHe had served in the armed steamers during the Seminole War in Florida,\nand had a good deal to say about sailing up the rivers there, through\nthe everglades, and popping off Indians on the banks. I remember his\ntelling a story about a party being discovered at quite a distance from\nthem; but one of the savages was made very conspicuous by a pewter\nplate, which he wore round his neck, and which glittered in the sun.\nThis plate proved his death; for, according to _Gun-Deck,_ he himself\nshot it through the middle, and the ball entered the wearer\u2019s heart. It\nwas a rat-killing war, he said.\n_Gun-Deck_ had touched at Cadiz: had been to Gibraltar; and ashore at\nMarseilles. He had sunned himself in the Bay of Naples: eaten figs and\noranges in Messina; and cheerfully lost one of his hearts at Malta,\namong the ladies there. And about all these things, he talked like a\nromantic man-of-war\u2019s man, who had seen the civilized world, and loved\nit; found it good, and a comfortable place to live in. So he and Larry\nnever could agree in their respective views of civilization, and of\nsavagery, of the Mediterranean and _Madagasky._\nCHAPTER XXII.\nTHE HIGHLANDER PASSES A WRECK\nWe were still on the Banks, when a terrific storm came down upon us,\nthe like of which I had never before beheld, or imagined. The rain\npoured down in sheets and cascades; the scupper holes could hardly\ncarry it off the decks; and in bracing the yards we waded about almost\nup to our knees; every thing floating about, like chips in a dock.\nThis violent rain was the precursor of a hard squall, for which we duly\nprepared, taking in our canvas to double-reefed-top-sails.\nThe tornado came rushing along at last, like a troop of wild horses\nbefore the flaming rush of a burning prairie. But after bowing and\ncringing to it awhile, the good Highlander was put off before it; and\nwith her nose in the water, went wallowing on, ploughing milk-white\nwaves, and leaving a streak of illuminated foam in her wake.\nIt was an awful scene. It made me catch my breath as I gazed. I could\nhardly stand on my feet, so violent was the motion of the ship. But\nwhile I reeled to and fro, the sailors only laughed at me; and bade me\nlook out that the ship did not fall overboard; and advised me to get a\nhandspike, and hold it down hard in the weather-scuppers, to steady her\nwild motions. But I was now getting a little too wise for this foolish\nkind of talk; though all through the voyage, they never gave it over.\nThis storm past, we had fair weather until we got into the Irish Sea.\nThe morning following the storm, when the sea and sky had become blue\nagain, the man aloft sung out that there was a wreck on the lee-beam.\nWe bore away for it, all hands looking eagerly toward it, and the\ncaptain in the mizzen-top with his spy-glass. Presently, we slowly\npassed alongside of it.\nIt was a dismantled, water-logged schooner, a most dismal sight, that\nmust have been drifting about for several long weeks. The bulwarks were\npretty much gone; and here and there the bare _stanchions,_ or posts,\nwere left standing, splitting in two the waves which broke clear over\nthe deck, lying almost even with the sea. The foremast was snapt off\nless than four feet from its base; and the shattered and splintered\nremnant looked like the stump of a pine tree thrown over in the woods.\nEvery time she rolled in the trough of the sea, her open main-hatchway\nyawned into view; but was as quickly filled, and submerged again, with\na rushing, gurgling sound, as the water ran into it with the lee-roll.\nAt the head of the stump of the mainmast, about ten feet above the\ndeck, something like a sleeve seemed nailed; it was supposed to be the\nrelic of a jacket, which must have been fastened there by the crew for\na signal, and been frayed out and blown away by the wind.\nLashed, and leaning over sideways against the taffrail, were three\ndark, green, grassy objects, that slowly swayed with every roll, but\notherwise were motionless. I saw the captain\u2019s, glass directed toward\nthem, and heard him say at last, \u201cThey must have been dead a long\ntime.\u201d These were sailors, who long ago had lashed themselves to the\ntaffrail for safety; but must have famished.\nFull of the awful interest of the scene, I surely thought the captain\nwould lower a boat to bury the bodies, and find out something about the\nschooner. But we did not stop at all; passing on our course, without so\nmuch as learning the schooner\u2019s name, though every one supposed her to\nbe a New Brunswick lumberman.\nOn the part of the sailors, no surprise was shown that our captain did\nnot send off a boat to the wreck; but the steerage passengers were\nindignant at what they called his barbarity. For me, I could not but\nfeel amazed and shocked at his indifference; but my subsequent sea\nexperiences have shown me, that such conduct as this is very common,\nthough not, of course, when human life can be saved.\nSo away we sailed, and left her; drifting, drifting on; a garden spot\nfor barnacles, and a playhouse for the sharks.\n\u201cLook there,\u201d said Jackson, hanging over the rail and coughing\u2014\u201clook\nthere; that\u2019s a sailor\u2019s coffin. Ha! ha! Buttons,\u201d turning round to\nme\u2014\u201chow do you like that, Buttons? Wouldn\u2019t you like to take a sail\nwith them \u2019ere dead men? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice?\u201d And then he tried to\nlaugh, but only coughed again. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at dem poor fellows,\u201d said\nMax, looking grave; \u201cdo\u2019 you see dar bodies, dar souls are farder off\ndan de Cape of Dood Hope.\u201d\n\u201cDood Hope, Dood Hope,\u201d shrieked Jackson, with a horrid grin, mimicking\nthe Dutchman, \u201cdare is no dood hope for dem, old boy; dey are drowned\nand d .... d, as you and I will be, Red Max, one of dese dark nights.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Blunt, \u201call sailors are saved; they have plenty of\nsqualls here below, but fair weather aloft.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did you get that out of your silly Dream Book, you Greek?\u201d howled\nJackson through a cough. \u201cDon\u2019t talk of heaven to me\u2014it\u2019s a lie\u2014I know\nit\u2014and they are all fools that believe in it. Do you think, you Greek,\nthat there\u2019s any heaven for _you?_ Will they let _you_ in there, with\nthat tarry hand, and that oily head of hair? Avast! when some shark\ngulps you down his hatchway one of these days, you\u2019ll find, that by\ndying, you\u2019ll only go from one gale of wind to another; mind that, you\nIrish cockney! Yes, you\u2019ll be bolted down like one of your own pills:\nand I should like to see the whole ship swallowed down in the Norway\nmaelstrom, like a box on \u2019em. That would be a dose of salts for ye!\u201d\nAnd so saying, he went off, holding his hands to his chest, and\ncoughing, as if his last hour was come.\nEvery day this Jackson seemed to grow worse and worse, both in body and\nmind. He seldom spoke, but to contradict, deride, or curse; and all the\ntime, though his face grew thinner and thinner, his eyes seemed to\nkindle more and more, as if he were going to die out at last, and leave\nthem burning like tapers before a corpse.\nThough he had never attended churches, and knew nothing about\nChristianity; no more than a Malay pirate; and though he could not read\na word, yet he was spontaneously an atheist and an infidel; and during\nthe long night watches, would enter into arguments, to prove that there\nwas nothing to be believed; nothing to be loved, and nothing worth\nliving for; but every thing to be hated, in the wide world. He was a\nhorrid desperado; and like a wild Indian, whom he resembled in his\ntawny skin and high cheek bones, he seemed to run amuck at heaven and\nearth. He was a Cain afloat; branded on his yellow brow with some\ninscrutable curse; and going about corrupting and searing every heart\nthat beat near him.\nBut there seemed even more woe than wickedness about the man; and his\nwickedness seemed to spring from his woe; and for all his hideousness,\nthere was that in his eye at times, that was ineffably pitiable and\ntouching; and though there were moments when I almost hated this\nJackson, yet I have pitied no man as I have pitied him.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nAN UNACCOUNTABLE CABIN-PASSENGER, AND A MYSTERIOUS YOUNG LADY\nAs yet, I have said nothing special about the passengers we carried\nout. But before making what little mention I shall of them, you must\nknow that the Highlander was not a Liverpool liner, or packet-ship,\nplying in connection with a sisterhood of packets, at stated intervals,\nbetween the two ports. No: she was only what is called a _regular\ntrader_ to Liverpool; sailing upon no fixed days, and acting very much\nas she pleased, being bound by no obligations of any kind: though in\nall her voyages, ever having New York or Liverpool for her destination.\nMerchant vessels which are neither liners nor regular traders, among\nsailors come under the general head of _transient ships;_ which implies\nthat they are here to-day, and somewhere else to-morrow, like Mullins\u2019s\ndog.\nBut I had no reason to regret that the Highlander was not a liner; for\naboard of those liners, from all I could gather from those who had\nsailed in them, the crew have terrible hard work, owing to their\ncarrying such a press of sail, in order to make as rapid passages as\npossible, and sustain the ship\u2019s reputation for speed. Hence it is,\nthat although they are the very best of sea-going craft, and built in\nthe best possible manner, and with the very best materials, yet, a few\nyears of scudding before the wind, as they do, seriously impairs their\nconstitutions\u2014 like robust young men, who live too fast in their\nteens\u2014and they are soon sold out for a song; generally to the people of\nNantucket, New Bedford, and Sag Harbor, who repair and fit them out for\nthe whaling business.\nThus, the ship that once carried over gay parties of ladies and\ngentlemen, as tourists, to Liverpool or London, now carries a crew of\nharpooners round Cape Horn into the Pacific. And the mahogany and\nbird\u2019s-eye maple cabin, which once held rosewood card-tables and\nbrilliant coffee-urns, and in which many a bottle of champagne, and\nmany a bright eye sparkled, _now_ accommodates a bluff Quaker captain\nfrom Martha\u2019s Vineyard; who, perhaps, while lying with his ship in the\nBay of Islands, in New Zealand, entertains a party of naked chiefs and\nsavages at dinner, in place of the packet-captain doing the honors to\nthe literati, theatrical stars, foreign princes, and gentlemen of\nleisure and fortune, who generally talked gossip, politics, and\nnonsense across the table, in transatlantic trips. The broad\nquarter-deck, too, where these gentry promenaded, is now often choked\nup by the enormous head of the sperm-whale, and vast masses of unctuous\nblubber; and every where reeks with oil during the prosecution of the\nfishery. Sic _transit gloria mundi!_ Thus departs the pride and glory\nof packet-ships! _It is_ like a broken down importer of French silks\nembarking in the soap-boning business.\nSo, not being a liner, the Highlander of course did not have very ample\naccommodations for cabin passengers. I believe there were not more than\nfive or six state-rooms, with two or three berths in each. At any rate,\non this particular voyage she only carried out one regular\ncabin-passenger; that is, a person previously unacquainted with the\ncaptain, who paid his fare down, and came on board soberly, and in a\nbusiness-like manner with his baggage.\nHe was an extremely little man, that solitary cabin-passenger\u2014the\npassenger who came on board in a business-like manner with his baggage;\nnever spoke to any one, and the captain seldom spoke to him.\nPerhaps he was a deputy from the Deaf and Dumb Institution in New York,\ngoing over to London to address the public in pantomime at Exeter Hall\nconcerning the signs of the times.\nHe was always in a brown study; sometimes sitting on the quarter-deck\nwith arms folded, and head hanging upon his chest. Then he would rise,\nand gaze out to windward, as if he had suddenly discovered a friend.\nBut looking disappointed, would retire slowly into his state-room,\nwhere you could see him through the little window, in an irregular\nsitting position, with the back part of him inserted into his berth,\nand his head, arms, and legs hanging out, buried in profound\nmeditation, with his fore-finger aside of his nose. He never was seen\nreading; never took a hand at cards; never smoked; never drank wine;\nnever conversed; and never staid to the dessert at dinner-time.\nHe seemed the true microcosm, or little world to himself: standing in\nno need of levying contributions upon the surrounding universe.\nConjecture was lost in speculating as to who he was, and what was his\nbusiness. The sailors, who are always curious with regard to such\nmatters, and criticise cabin-passengers more than cabin-passengers are\nperhaps aware at the time, completely exhausted themselves in\nsuppositions, some of which are characteristically curious.\nOne of the crew said he was a mysterious bearer of secret dispatches to\nthe English court; others opined that he was a traveling surgeon and\nbonesetter, but for what reason they thought so, I never could learn;\nand others declared that he must either be an unprincipled bigamist,\nflying from his last wife and several small children; or a scoundrelly\nforger, bank-robber, or general burglar, who was returning to his\nbeloved country with his ill-gotten booty. One observing sailor was of\nopinion that he was an English murderer, overwhelmed with speechless\nremorse, and returning home to make a full confession and be hanged.\nBut it was a little singular, that among all their sage and sometimes\nconfident opinings, not one charitable one was made; no! they were all\nsadly to the prejudice of his moral and religious character. But this\nis the way all the world over. Miserable man! could you have had an\ninkling of what they thought of you, I know not what you would have\ndone.\nHowever, not knowing any thing about these surmisings and suspicions,\nthis mysterious cabin-passenger went on his way, calm, cool, and\ncollected; never troubled any body, and nobody troubled him. Sometimes,\nof a moonlight night he glided about the deck, like the ghost of a\nhospital attendant; flitting from mast to mast; now hovering round the\nskylight, now vibrating in the vicinity of the binnacle. Blunt, the\nDream Book tar, swore he was a magician; and took an extra dose of\nsalts, by way of precaution against his spells.\nWhen we were but a few days from port, a comical adventure befell this\ncabin-passenger. There is an old custom, still in vogue among some\nmerchant sailors, of tying fast in the rigging any lubberly landsman of\na passenger who may be detected taking excursions aloft, however\nmoderate the flight of the awkward fowl. This is called _\u201cmaking a\nspread eagle\u201d_ of the man; and before he is liberated, a promise is\nexacted, that before arriving in port, he shall furnish the ship\u2019s\ncompany with money enough for a treat all round.\nNow this being one of the perquisites of sailors, they are always on\nthe keen look-out for an opportunity of levying such contributions upon\nincautious strangers; though they never attempt it in presence of the\ncaptain; as for the mates, they purposely avert their eyes, and are\nearnestly engaged about something else, whenever they get an inkling of\nthis proceeding going on. But, with only one poor fellow of a\ncabin-passenger on board of the Highlander, and _he_ such a quiet,\nunobtrusive, unadventurous wight, there seemed little chance for\nlevying contributions.\nOne remarkably pleasant morning, however, what should be seen, half way\nup the mizzen rigging, but the figure of our cabin-passenger, holding\non with might and main by all four limbs, and with his head fearfully\nturned round, gazing off to the horizon. He looked as if he had the\nnightmare; and in some sudden and unaccountable fit of insanity, he\nmust have been impelled to the taking up of that perilous position.\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d said the mate, who was a bit of a wag, \u201cyou will surely\nfall, sir! Steward, spread a mattress on deck, under the gentleman!\u201d\nBut no sooner was our Greenland sailor\u2019s attention called to the sight,\nthan snatching up some rope-yarn, he ran softly up behind the\npassenger, and without speaking a word, began binding him hand and\nfoot. The stranger was more dumb than ever with amazement; at last\nviolently remonstrated; but in vain; for as his fearfulness of falling\nmade him keep his hands glued to the ropes, and so prevented him from\nany effectual resistance, he was soon made a handsome _spread-eagle_\nof, to the great satisfaction of the crew.\nIt was now discovered for the first, that this singular passenger\nstammered and stuttered very badly, which, perhaps, was the cause of\nhis reservedness.\n\u201cWha-wha-what i-i-is this f-f-for?\u201d\n\u201cSpread-eagle, sir,\u201d said the Greenlander, thinking that those few\nwords would at once make the matter plain.\n\u201cWha-wha-what that me-me-mean?\u201d\n\u201cTreats all round, sir,\u201d said the Greenlander, wondering at the other\u2019s\nobtusity, who, however, had never so much as heard of the thing before.\nAt last, upon his reluctant acquiescence in the demands of the sailor,\nand handing him two half-crown pieces, the unfortunate passenger was\nsuffered to descend.\nThe last I ever saw of this man was his getting into a cab at Prince\u2019s\nDock Gates in Liverpool, and driving off alone to parts unknown. He had\nnothing but a valise with him, and an umbrella; but his pockets looked\nstuffed out; perhaps he used them for carpet-bags.\nI must now give some account of another and still more mysterious,\nthough very different, sort of an occupant of the cabin, of whom I have\npreviously hinted. What say you to a charming young girl?\u2014just the girl\nto sing the Dashing White Sergeant; a martial, military-looking girl;\nher father must have been a general. Her hair was auburn; her eyes were\nblue; her cheeks were white and red; and Captain Riga was her most\ndevoted.\nTo the curious questions of the sailors concerning who she was, the\nsteward used to answer, that she was the daughter of one of the\nLiverpool dock-masters, who, for the benefit of her health and the\nimprovement of her mind, had sent her out to America in the Highlander,\nunder the captain\u2019s charge, who was his particular friend; and that now\nthe young lady was returning home from her tour.\nAnd truly the captain proved an attentive father to her, and often\npromenaded with her hanging on his arm, past the forlorn bearer of\nsecret dispatches, who would look up now and then out of his reveries,\nand cast a furtive glance of wonder, as if he thought the captain was\naudacious.\nConsidering his beautiful ward, I thought the captain behaved\nungallantly, to say the least, in availing himself of the opportunity\nof her charming society, to wear out his remaining old clothes; for no\ngentleman ever pretends to save his best coat when a lady is in the\ncase; indeed, he generally thirsts for a chance to abase it, by\nconverting it into a pontoon over a puddle, like Sir Walter Raleigh,\nthat the ladies may not soil the soles of their dainty slippers. But\nthis Captain Riga was no Raleigh, and hardly any sort of a true\ngentleman whatever, as I have formerly declared. Yet, perhaps, he might\nhave worn his old clothes in this instance, for the express purpose of\nproving, by his disdain for the toilet, that he was nothing but the\nyoung lady\u2019s guardian; for many guardians do not care one fig how\nshabby they look.\nBut for all this, the passage out was one long paternal sort of a\nshabby flirtation between this hoydenish nymph and the ill-dressed\ncaptain. And surely, if her good mother, were she living, could have\nseen this young lady, she would have given her an endless lecture for\nher conduct, and a copy of Mrs. Ellis\u2019s Daughters of England to read\nand digest. I shall say no more of this anonymous nymph; only, that\nwhen we arrived at Liverpool, she issued from her cabin in a richly\nembroidered silk dress, and lace hat and veil, and a sort of Chinese\numbrella or parasol, which one of the sailors declared \u201cspandangalous;\u201d\nand the captain followed after in his best broadcloth and beaver, with\na gold-headed cane; and away they went in a carriage, and that was the\nlast of her; I hope she is well and happy now; but I have some\nmisgivings.\nIt now remains to speak of the steerage passengers. There were not more\nthan twenty or thirty of them, mostly mechanics, returning home, after\na prosperous stay in America, to escort their wives and families back.\nThese were the only occupants of the steerage that I ever knew of; till\nearly one morning, in the gray dawn, when we made Cape Clear, the south\npoint of Ireland, the apparition of a tall Irishman, in a shabby shirt\nof bed-ticking, emerged from the fore hatchway, and stood leaning on\nthe rail, looking landward with a fixed, reminiscent expression, and\ndiligently scratching its back with both hands. We all started at the\nsight, for no one had ever seen the apparition before; and when we\nremembered that it must have been burrowing all the passage down in its\nbunk, the only probable reason of its so manipulating its back became\nshockingly obvious.\nI had almost forgotten another passenger of ours, a little boy not four\nfeet high, an English lad, who, when we were about forty-eight hours\nfrom New York, suddenly appeared on deck, asking for something to eat.\nIt seems he was the son of a carpenter, a widower, with this only\nchild, who had gone out to America in the Highlander some six months\nprevious, where he fell to drinking, and soon died, leaving the boy a\nfriendless orphan in a foreign land.\nFor several weeks the boy wandered about the wharves, picking up a\nprecarious livelihood by sucking molasses out of the casks discharged\nfrom West India ships, and occasionally regaling himself upon stray\noranges and lemons found floating in the docks. He passed his nights\nsometimes in a stall in the markets, sometimes in an empty hogshead on\nthe piers, sometimes in a doorway, and once in the watchhouse, from\nwhich he escaped the next morning, running as he told me, right between\nthe doorkeeper\u2019s legs, when he was taking another vagrant to task for\nrepeatedly throwing himself upon the public charities.\nAt last, while straying along the docks, he chanced to catch sight of\nthe Highlander, and immediately recognized her as the very ship which\nbrought him and his father out from England. He at once resolved to\nreturn in her; and, accosting the captain, stated his case, and begged\na passage. The captain refused to give it; but, nothing daunted, the\nheroic little fellow resolved to conceal himself on board previous to\nthe ship\u2019s sailing; which he did, stowing himself away in the\n_between-decks;_ and moreover, as he told us, in a narrow space between\ntwo large casks of water, from which he now and then thrust out his\nhead for air. And once a steerage passenger rose in the night and poked\nin and rattled about a stick where he was, thinking him an uncommon\nlarge rat, who was after stealing a passage across the Atlantic. There\nare plenty of passengers of that kind continually plying between\nLiverpool and New York.\nAs soon as he divulged the fact of his being on board, which he took\ncare should not happen till he thought the ship must be out of sight of\nland; the captain had him called aft, and after giving him a thorough\nshaking, and threatening to toss him overboard as a tit-bit for _John\nShark,_ he told the mate to send him forward among the sailors, and let\nhim live there. The sailors received him with open arms; but before\ncaressing him much, they gave him a thorough washing in the\nlee-scuppers, when he turned out to be quite a handsome lad, though\nthin and pale with the hardships he had suffered. However, by good\nnursing and plenty to eat, he soon improved and grew fat; and before\nmany days was as fine a looking little fellow, as you might pick out of\nQueen Victoria\u2019s nursery. The sailors took the warmest interest in him.\nOne made him a little hat with a long ribbon; another a little jacket;\na third a comical little pair of man-of-war\u2019s-man\u2019s trowsers; so that\nin the end, he looked like a juvenile boatswain\u2019s mate. Then the cook\nfurnished him with a little tin pot and pan; and the steward made him a\npresent of a pewter tea-spoon; and a steerage passenger gave him a jack\nknife. And thus provided, he used to sit at meal times half way up on\nthe forecastle ladder, making a great racket with his pot and pan, and\nmerry as a cricket. He was an uncommonly fine, cheerful, clever, arch\nlittle fellow, only six years old, and it was a thousand pities that he\nshould be abandoned, as he was. Who can say, whether he is fated to be\na convict in New South Wales, or a member of Parliament for Liverpool?\nWhen we got to that port, by the way, a purse was made up for him; the\ncaptain, officers, and the mysterious cabin passenger contributing\ntheir best wishes, and the sailors and poor steerage passengers\nsomething like fifteen dollars in cash and tobacco. But I had almost\nforgot to add that the daughter of the dock-master gave him a fine lace\npocket-handkerchief and a card-case to remember her by; very valuable,\nbut somewhat inappropriate presents. Thus supplied, the little hero\nwent ashore by himself; and I lost sight of him in the vast crowds\nthronging the docks of Liverpool.\nI must here mention, as some relief to the impression which Jackson\u2019s\ncharacter must have made upon the reader, that in several ways he at\nfirst befriended this boy; but the boy always shrunk from him; till, at\nlast, stung by his conduct, Jackson spoke to him no more; and seemed to\nhate him, harmless as he was, along with all the rest of the world.\nAs for the Lancashire lad, he was a stupid sort of fellow, as I have\nbefore hinted. So, little interest was taken in him, that he was\npermitted to go ashore at last, without a good-by from any person but\none.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nHE BEGINS TO HOP ABOUT IN THE RIGGING LIKE A SAINT JAGO\u2019S MONKEY\nBut we have not got to Liverpool yet; though, as there is little more\nto be said concerning the passage out, the Highlander may as well make\nsail and get there as soon as possible. The brief interval will perhaps\nbe profitably employed in relating what progress I made in learning the\nduties of a sailor.\nAfter my heroic feat in loosing the main-skysail, the mate entertained\ngood hopes of my becoming a rare mariner. In the fullness of his heart,\nhe ordered me to turn over the superintendence of the chicken-coop to\nthe Lancashire boy; which I did, very willingly. After that, I took\ncare to show the utmost alacrity in running aloft, which by this time\nbecame mere fun for me; and nothing delighted me more than to sit on\none of the topsail-yards, for hours together, helping Max or the\nGreenlander as they worked at the rigging.\nAt sea, the sailors are continually engaged in _\u201cparcelling,\u201d\n\u201cserving,\u201d_ and in a thousand ways ornamenting and repairing the\nnumberless shrouds and stays; mending sails, or turning one side of the\ndeck into a rope-walk, where they manufacture a clumsy sort of twine,\ncalled _spun-yarn._ This is spun with a winch; and many an hour the\nLancashire boy had to play the part of an engine, and contribute the\nmotive power. For material, they use odds and ends of old rigging\ncalled _\u201cjunk,\u201d_ the yarns of which are picked to pieces, and then\ntwisted into new combinations, something as most books are\nmanufactured. This \u201cjunk\u201d is bought at the junk shops along the\nwharves; outlandish looking dens, generally subterranean, full of old\niron, old shrouds, spars, rusty blocks, and superannuated tackles; and\nkept by villainous looking old men, in tarred trowsers, and with yellow\nbeards like oakum. They look like wreckers; and the scattered goods\nthey expose for sale, involuntarily remind one of the sea-beach,\ncovered with keels and cordage, swept ashore in a gale.\nYes, I was now as nimble as a monkey in the rigging, and at the cry of\n_\u201ctumble up there, my hearties, and take in sail,\u201d I_ was among the\nfirst ground-and-lofty tumblers, that sprang aloft at the word.\nBut the first time we reefed top-sails of a dark night, and I found\nmyself hanging over the yard with eleven others, the ship plunging and\nrearing like a mad horse, till I felt like being jerked off the spar;\nthen, indeed, I thought of a feather-bed at home, and hung on with\ntooth and nail; with no chance for snoring. But a few repetitions, soon\nmade me used to it; and before long, I tied my reef-point as quickly\nand expertly as the best of them; never making what they call a\n_\u201cgranny-knot,\u201d_ and slipt down on deck by the bare stays, instead of\nthe shrouds. It is surprising, how soon a boy overcomes his timidity\nabout going aloft. For my own part, my nerves became as steady as the\nearth\u2019s diameter, and I felt as fearless on the royal yard, as Sam\nPatch on the cliff of Niagara. To my amazement, also, I found, that\nrunning up the rigging at sea, especially during a squall, was much\neasier than while lying in port. For as you always go up on the\nwindward side, and the ship leans over, it makes more of a _stairs_ of\nthe rigging; whereas, in harbor, it is almost straight up and down.\nBesides, the pitching and rolling only imparts a pleasant sort of\nvitality to the vessel; so that the difference in being aloft in a ship\nat sea, and a ship in harbor, is pretty much the same, as riding a real\nlive horse and a wooden one. And even if the live charger should pitch\nyou over his head, _that_ would be much more satisfactory, than an\ninglorious fall from the other.\nI took great delight in furling the top-gallant sails and royals in a\nhard blow; which duty required two hands on the yard.\nThere was a wild delirium about it; a fine rushing of the blood about\nthe heart; and a glad, thrilling, and throbbing of the whole system, to\nfind yourself tossed up at every pitch into the clouds of a stormy sky,\nand hovering like a judgment angel between heaven and earth; both hands\nfree, with one foot in the rigging, and one somewhere behind you in the\nair. The sail would fill out like a balloon, with a report like a small\ncannon, and then collapse and sink away into a handful. And the feeling\nof mastering the rebellious canvas, and tying it down like a slave to\nthe spar, and binding it over and over with the _gasket,_ had a touch\nof pride and power in it, such as young King Richard must have felt,\nwhen he trampled down the insurgents of Wat Tyler.\nAs for steering, they never would let me go to the helm, except during\na calm, when I and the figure-head on the bow were about equally\nemployed.\nBy the way, that figure-head was a passenger I forgot to make mention\nof before.\nHe was a gallant six-footer of a Highlander _\u201cin full fig,\u201d_ with\nbright tartans, bare knees, barred leggings, and blue bonnet and the\nmost vermilion of cheeks. He was game to his wooden marrow, and stood\nup to it through thick and thin; one foot a little advanced, and his\nright arm stretched forward, daring on the waves. In a gale of wind it\nwas glorious to watch him standing at his post like a hero, and\nplunging up and down the watery Highlands and Lowlands, as the ship\nwent roaming on her way. He was a veteran with many wounds of many\nsea-fights; and when he got to Liverpool a figure-head-builder there,\namputated his left leg, and gave him another wooden one, which I am\nsorry to say, did not fit him very well, for ever after he looked as if\nhe limped. Then this figure-head-surgeon gave him another nose, and\ntouched up one eye, and repaired a rent in his tartans. After that the\npainter came and made his toilet all over again; giving him a new suit\nthroughout, with a plaid of a beautiful pattern.\nI do not know what has become of Donald now, but I hope he is safe and\nsnug with a handsome pension in the \u201cSailors\u2019-Snug-Harbor\u201d on Staten\nIsland.\nThe reason why they gave me such a slender chance of learning to steer\nwas this. I was quite young and raw, and steering a ship is a great\nart, upon which much depends; especially the making a short passage;\nfor if the helmsman be a clumsy, careless fellow, or ignorant of his\nduty, he keeps the ship going about in a melancholy state of indecision\nas to its precise destination; so that on a voyage to Liverpool, it may\nbe pointing one while for Gibraltar, then for Rotterdam, and now for\nJohn o\u2019 Groat\u2019s; all of which is worse than wasted time. Whereas, a\ntrue steersman keeps her to her work night and day; and tries to make a\nbee-line from port to port.\nThen, in a sudden squall, inattention, or want of quickness at the\nhelm, might make the ship _\u201clurch to\u201d\u2014or \u201cbring her by the lee.\u201d_ And\nwhat those things are, the cabin passengers would never find out, when\nthey found themselves going down, down, down, and bidding good-by\nforever to the moon and stars.\nAnd they little think, many of them, fine gentlemen and ladies that\nthey are, what an important personage, and how much to be had in\nreverence, is the rough fellow in the pea-jacket, whom they see\nstanding at the wheel, now cocking his eye aloft, and then peeping at\nthe compass, or looking out to windward.\nWhy, that fellow has all your lives and eternities in his hand; and\nwith one small and almost imperceptible motion of a spoke, in a gale of\nwind, might give a vast deal of work to surrogates and lawyers, in\nproving last wills and testaments.\nAy, you may well stare at him now. He does not look much like a man who\nmight play into the hands of an heir-at-law, does he? Yet such is the\ncase. Watch him close, therefore; take him down into your state-room\noccasionally after a stormy watch, and make a friend of him. A glass of\ncordial will do it. And if you or your heirs are interested with the\nunderwriters, then also have an eye on him. And if you remark, that of\nthe crew, all the men who come to the helm are careless, or\ninefficient; and if you observe the captain scolding them often, and\ncrying out: _\u201cLuff, you rascal; she\u2019s falling off!\u201d_ or, _\u201cKeep her\nsteady, you scoundrel, you\u2019re boxing the compass!\u201d_ then hurry down to\nyour state-room, and if you have not yet made a will, get out your\nstationery and go at it; and when it is done, seal it up in a bottle,\nlike Columbus\u2019 log, and it may possibly drift ashore, when you are\ndrowned in the next gale of wind.\nCHAPTER XXV.\nQUARTER-DECK FURNITURE\nThough, for reasons hinted at above, they would not let me steer, I\ncontented myself with learning the compass, a graphic facsimile of\nwhich I drew on a blank leaf of the _\u201cWealth of Nations,\u201d_ and studied\nit every morning, like the multiplication table.\nI liked to peep in at the binnacle, and watch the needle; and I\nwondered how it was that it pointed north, rather than south or west;\nfor I do not know that any reason can be given why it points in the\nprecise direction it does. One would think, too, that, as since the\nbeginning of the world almost, the tide of emigration has been setting\nwest, the needle would point that way; whereas, it is forever pointing\nits fixed fore-finger toward the Pole, where there are few inducements\nto attract a sailor, unless it be plenty of ice for mint-juleps.\nOur binnacle, by the way, the place that holds a ship\u2019s compasses,\ndeserves a word of mention. It was a little house, about the bigness of\na common bird-cage, with sliding panel doors, and two drawing-rooms\nwithin, and constantly perched upon a stand, right in front of the\nhelm. It had two chimney stacks to carry off the smoke of the lamp that\nburned in it by night.\nIt was painted green, and on two sides had Venetian blinds; and on one\nside two glazed sashes; so that it looked like a cool little summer\nretreat, a snug bit of an arbor at the end of a shady garden lane. Had\nI been the captain, I would have planted vines in boxes, and placed\nthem so as to overrun this binnacle; or I would have put canary-birds\nwithin; and so made an aviary of it. It is surprising what a different\nair may be imparted to the meanest thing by the dainty hand of taste.\nNor must I omit the helm itself, which was one of a new construction,\nand a particular favorite of the captain. It was a complex system of\ncogs and wheels and spindles, all of polished brass, and looked\nsomething like a printing-press, or power-loom. The sailors, however,\ndid not like it much, owing to the casualties that happened to their\nimprudent fingers, by catching in among the cogs and other intricate\ncontrivances. Then, sometimes in a calm, when the sudden swells would\nlift the ship, the helm would fetch a lurch, and send the helmsman\nrevolving round like Ixion, often seriously hurting him; a sort of\nbreaking on the wheel.\nThe _harness-cask,_ also, a sort of sea side-board, or rather\nmeat-safe, in which a week\u2019s allowance of salt pork and beef is kept,\ndeserves being chronicled. It formed part of the standing furniture of\nthe quarter-deck. Of an oval shape, it was banded round with hoops all\nsilver-gilt, with gilded bands secured with gilded screws, and a gilded\npadlock, richly chased. This formed the captain\u2019s smoking-seat, where\nhe would perch himself of an afternoon, a tasseled Chinese cap upon his\nhead, and a fragrant Havanna between his white and canine-looking\nteeth. He took much solid comfort, Captain Riga.\nThen the magnificent _capstan!_ The pride and glory of the whole ship\u2019s\ncompany, the constant care and dandled darling of the cook, whose duty\nit was to keep it polished like a teapot; and it was an object of\ndistant admiration to the steerage passengers. Like a parlor\ncenter-table, it stood full in the middle of the quarter-deck, radiant\nwith brazen stars, and variegated with diamond-shaped veneerings of\nmahogany and satin wood. This was the captain\u2019s lounge, and the chief\nmate\u2019s secretary, in the bar-holes keeping paper and pencil for\nmemorandums.\nI might proceed and speak of the _booby-hatch,_ used as a sort of\nsettee by the officers, and the _fife-rail_ round the mainmast,\ninclosing a little ark of canvas, painted green, where a small white\ndog with a blue ribbon round his neck, belonging to the dock-master\u2019s\ndaughter, used to take his morning walks, and air himself in this small\nedition of the New York Bowling-Green.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\nA SAILOR A JACK OF ALL TRADES\nAs I began to learn my sailor duties, and show activity in running\naloft, the men, I observed, treated me with a little more\nconsideration, though not at all relaxing in a certain air of\nprofessional superiority. For the mere knowing of the names of the\nropes, and familiarizing yourself with their places, so that you can\nlay hold of them in the darkest night; and the loosing and furling of\nthe canvas, and reefing topsails, and hauling braces; all this, though\nof course forming an indispensable part of a seaman\u2019s vocation, and the\nbusiness in which he is principally engaged; yet these are things which\na beginner of ordinary capacity soon masters, and which are far\ninferior to many other matters familiar to an _\u201cable seaman.\u201d_\nWhat did I know, for instance, about _striking a top-gallant-mast,_ and\nsending it down on deck in a gale of wind? Could I have _turned in a\ndead-eye,_ or in the approved nautical style have _clapt a seizing on\nthe main-stay?_ What did I know of _\u201cpassing a gammoning,\u201d \u201creiving a\nBurton,\u201d \u201cstrapping a shoe-block,\u201d \u201cclearing a foul hawse,\u201d_ and\ninnumerable other intricacies?\nThe business of a thorough-bred sailor is a special calling, as much of\na regular trade as a carpenter\u2019s or locksmith\u2019s. Indeed, it requires\nconsiderably more adroitness, and far more versatility of talent.\nIn the English merchant service boys serve a long apprenticeship to the\nsea, of seven years. Most of them first enter the Newcastle colliers,\nwhere they see a great deal of severe coasting service. In an old copy\nof the Letters of Junius, belonging to my father, I remember reading,\nthat coal to supply the city of London could be dug at Blackheath, and\nsold for one half the price that the people of London then paid for it;\nbut the Government would not suffer the mines to be opened, as it would\ndestroy the great nursery for British seamen.\nA thorough sailor must understand much of other avocations. He must be\na bit of an embroiderer, to work fanciful collars of hempen lace about\nthe shrouds; he must be something of a weaver, to weave mats of\nrope-yarns for lashings to the boats; he must have a touch of\nmillinery, so as to tie graceful bows and knots, such as _Matthew\nWalker\u2019s roses,_ and _Turk\u2019s heads;_ he must be a bit of a musician, in\norder to sing out at the halyards; he must be a sort of jeweler, to set\ndead-eyes in the standing rigging; he must be a carpenter, to enable\nhim to make a jurymast out of a yard in case of emergency; he must be a\nsempstress, to darn and mend the sails; a ropemaker, to twist _marline_\nand _Spanish foxes;_ a blacksmith, to make hooks and thimbles for the\nblocks: in short, he must be a sort of Jack of all trades, in order to\nmaster his own. And this, perhaps, in a greater or less degree, is\npretty much the case with all things else; for you know nothing till\nyou know all; which is the reason we never know anything.\nA sailor, also, in working at the rigging, uses special tools peculiar\nto his calling\u2014_fids, serving-mallets, toggles, prickers,\nmarlingspikes, palms, heavers,_ and many more. The smaller sort he\ngenerally carries with him from ship to ship in a sort of canvas\nreticule.\nThe estimation in which a ship\u2019s crew hold the knowledge of such\naccomplishments as these, is expressed in the phrase they apply to one\nwho is a clever practitioner. To distinguish such a mariner from those\nwho merely _\u201chand, reef, and steer,\u201d_ that is, run aloft, furl sails,\nhaul ropes, and stand at the wheel, they say he is _\u201ca sailor-man\u201d_\nwhich means that he not only knows how to reef a topsail, but is an\nartist in the rigging.\nNow, alas! I had no chance given me to become initiated in this art and\nmystery; no further, at least, than by looking on, and watching how\nthat these things might be done as well as others, the reason was, that\nI had only shipped for this one voyage in the Highlander, a short\nvoyage too; and it was not worth while to teach _me_ any thing, the\nfruit of which instructions could be only reaped by the next ship I\nmight belong to. All they wanted of me was the good-will of my muscles,\nand the use of my backbone\u2014comparatively small though it was at that\ntime\u2014by way of a lever, for the above-mentioned artists to employ when\nwanted. Accordingly, when any embroidery was going on in the rigging, I\nwas set to the most inglorious avocations; as in the merchant service\nit is a religious maxim to keep the hands always employed at something\nor other, never mind what, during their watch on deck.\nOften furnished with a club-hammer, they swung me over the bows in a\nbowline, to pound the rust off the anchor: a most monotonous, and to me\na most uncongenial and irksome business. There was a remarkable\nfatality attending the various hammers I carried over with me. Somehow\nthey _would_ drop out of my hands into the sea. But the supply of\nreserved hammers seemed unlimited: also the blessings and benedictions\nI received from the chief mate for my clumsiness.\nAt other times, they set me to picking oakum, like a convict, which\nhempen business disagreeably obtruded thoughts of halters and the\ngallows; or whittling belaying-pins, like a Down-Easter.\nHowever, I endeavored to bear it all like a young philosopher, and\nwhiled away the tedious hours by gazing through a port-hole while my\nhands were plying, and repeating Lord Byron\u2019s Address to the Ocean,\nwhich I had often spouted on the stage at the High School at home.\nYes, I got used to all these matters, and took most things coolly, in\nthe spirit of Seneca and the stoics.\nAll but the _\u201cturning out\u201d_ or rising from your berth when the watch\nwas called at night\u2014_that_ I never fancied. It was a sort of\nacquaintance, which the more I cultivated, the more I shrunk from; a\nthankless, miserable business, truly.\nConsider that after walking the deck for four full hours, you go below\nto sleep: and while thus innocently employed in reposing your wearied\nlimbs, you are started up\u2014it seems but the next instant after closing\nyour lids\u2014and hurried on deck again, into the same disagreeably dark\nand, perhaps, stormy night, from which you descended into the\nforecastle.\nThe previous interval of slumber was almost wholly lost to me; at least\nthe golden opportunity could not be appreciated: for though it is\nusually deemed a comfortable thing to be asleep, yet at the time no one\nis conscious that he is so enjoying himself. Therefore I made a little\nprivate arrangement with the Lancashire lad, who was in the other\nwatch, just to step below occasionally, and shake me, and whisper in my\near\u2014_\u201cWatch below, Buttons; watch below\u201d\u2014_which pleasantly reminded me\nof the delightful fact. Then I would turn over on my side, and take\nanother nap; and in this manner I enjoyed several complete watches in\nmy bunk to the other sailor\u2019s one. I recommend the plan to all landsmen\ncontemplating a voyage to sea.\nBut notwithstanding all these contrivances, the dreadful sequel could\nnot be avoided. Eight bells would at last be struck, and the men on\ndeck, exhilarated by the prospect of changing places with us, would\ncall the watch in a most provoking but mirthful and facetious style.\nAs thus:\u2014\n\u201cStarboard watch, ahoy! eight bells there, below! Tumble up, my lively\nhearties; steamboat alongside waiting for your trunks: bear a hand,\nbear a hand with your knee-buckles, my sweet and pleasant fellows! fine\nshower-bath here on deck. Hurrah, hurrah! your ice-cream is getting\ncold!\u201d\nWhereupon some of the old croakers who were getting into their trowsers\nwould reply with\u2014\u201cOh, stop your gabble, will you? don\u2019t be in such a\nhurry, now. You feel sweet, don\u2019t you?\u201d with other exclamations, some\nof which were full of fury.\nAnd it was not a little curious to remark, that at the expiration of\nthe ensuing watch, the tables would be turned; and we on deck became\nthe wits and jokers, and those below the grizzly bears and growlers.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\nHE GETS A PEEP AT IRELAND, AND AT LAST ARRIVES AT LIVERPOOL\nThe Highlander was not a grayhound, not a very fast sailer; and so, the\npassage, which some of the packet ships make in fifteen or sixteen\ndays, employed us about thirty.\nAt last, one morning I came on deck, and they told me that Ireland was\nin sight.\nIreland in sight! A foreign country actually visible! I peered hard,\nbut could see nothing but a bluish, cloud-like spot to the northeast.\nWas that Ireland? Why, there was nothing remarkable about that; nothing\nstartling. If _that\u2019s_ the way a foreign country looks, I might as well\nhave staid at home.\nNow what, exactly, I had fancied the shore would look like, I can not\nsay; but I had a vague idea that it would be something strange and\nwonderful. However, there it was; and as the light increased and the\nship sailed nearer and nearer, the land began to magnify, and I gazed\nat it with increasing interest.\nIreland! I thought of Robert Emmet, and that last speech of his before\nLord Norbury; I thought of Tommy Moore, and his amatory verses: I\nthought of Curran, Grattan, Plunket, and O\u2019Connell; I thought of my\nuncle\u2019s ostler, Patrick Flinnigan; and I thought of the shipwreck of\nthe gallant Albion, tost to pieces on the very shore now in sight; and\nI thought I should very much like to leave the ship and visit Dublin\nand the Giant\u2019s Causeway.\nPresently a fishing-boat drew near, and I rushed to get a view of it;\nbut it was a very ordinary looking boat, bobbing up and down, as any\nother boat would have done; yet, when I considered that the solitary\nman in it was actually a born native of the land in sight; that in all\nprobability he had never been in America, and knew nothing about my\nfriends at home, I began to think that he looked somewhat strange.\nHe was a very fluent fellow, and as soon as we were within hailing\ndistance, cried out\u2014\u201cAh, my fine sailors, from Ameriky, ain\u2019t ye, my\nbeautiful sailors?\u201d And concluded by calling upon us to stop and heave\na rope. Thinking he might have something important to communicate, the\nmate accordingly backed the main yard, and a rope being thrown, the\nstranger kept hauling in upon it, and coiling it down, crying, \u201cpay\nout! pay out, my honeys; ah! but you\u2019re noble fellows!\u201d Till at last\nthe mate asked him why he did not come alongside, adding, \u201cHaven\u2019t you\nenough rope yet?\u201d\n\u201cSure and I have,\u201d replied the fisherman, \u201cand it\u2019s time for Pat to cut\nand run!\u201d and so saying, his knife severed the rope, and with a\nKilkenny grin, he sprang to his tiller, put his little craft before the\nwind, and bowled away from us, with some fifteen fathoms of our\ntow-line.\n\u201cAnd may the Old Boy hurry after you, and hang you in your stolen hemp,\nyou Irish blackguard!\u201d cried the mate, shaking his fist at the receding\nboat, after recovering from his first fit of amazement.\nHere, then, was a beautiful introduction to the eastern hemisphere;\nfairly robbed before striking soundings. This trick upon experienced\ntravelers certainly beat all I had ever heard about the wooden nutmegs\nand bass-wood pumpkin seeds of Connecticut. And I thought if there were\nany more Hibernians like our friend Pat, the Yankee peddlers might as\nwell give it up.\nThe next land we saw was Wales. It was high noon, and a long line of\npurple mountains lay like banks of clouds against the east.\nCould this be really Wales?\u2014Wales?\u2014and I thought of the Prince of\nWales.\nAnd did a real queen with a diadem reign over that very land I was\nlooking at, with the identical eyes in my own head?\u2014And then I thought\nof a grandfather of mine, who had fought against the ancestor of this\nqueen at Bunker\u2019s Hill.\nBut, after all, the general effect of these mountains was mortifyingly\nlike the general effect of the Kaatskill Mountains on the Hudson River.\nWith a light breeze, we sailed on till next day, when we made Holyhead\nand Anglesea. Then it fell almost calm, and what little wind we had,\nwas ahead; so we kept tacking to and fro, just gliding through the\nwater, and always hovering in sight of a snow-white tower in the\ndistance, which might have been a fort, or a light-house. I lost myself\nin conjectures as to what sort of people might be tenanting that lonely\nedifice, and whether they knew any thing about us.\nThe third day, with a good wind over the taffrail, we arrived so near\nour destination, that we took a pilot at dusk.\nHe, and every thing connected with him were very different from our New\nYork pilot. In the first place, the pilot boat that brought him was a\nplethoric looking sloop-rigged boat, with flat bows, that went wheezing\nthrough the water; quite in contrast to the little gull of a schooner,\nthat bade us adieu off Sandy Hook. Aboard of her were ten or twelve\nother pilots, fellows with shaggy brows, and muffled in shaggy coats,\nwho sat grouped together on deck like a fire-side of bears, wintering\nin Aroostook. They must have had fine sociable times, though, together;\ncruising about the Irish Sea in quest of Liverpool-bound vessels;\nsmoking cigars, drinking brandy-and-water, and spinning yarns; till at\nlast, one by one, they are all scattered on board of different ships,\nand meet again by the side of a blazing sea-coal fire in some Liverpool\ntaproom, and prepare for another yachting.\nNow, when this English pilot boarded us, I stared at him as if he had\nbeen some wild animal just escaped from the Zoological Gardens; for\nhere was a real live Englishman, just from England. Nevertheless, as he\nsoon fell to ordering us here and there, and swearing vociferously in a\nlanguage quite familiar to me; I began to think him very common-place,\nand considerable of a bore after all.\nAfter running till about midnight, we _\u201chove-to\u201d_ near the mouth of the\nMersey; and next morning, before day-break, took the first of the\nflood; and with a fair wind, stood into the river; which, at its mouth,\nis quite an arm of the sea. Presently, in the misty twilight, we passed\nimmense buoys, and caught sight of distant objects on shore, vague and\nshadowy shapes, like Ossian\u2019s ghosts.\nAs I stood leaning over the side, and trying to summon up some image of\nLiverpool, to see how the reality would answer to my conceit; and while\nthe fog, and mist, and gray dawn were investing every thing with a\nmysterious interest, I was startled by the doleful, dismal sound of a\ngreat bell, whose slow intermitting tolling seemed in unison with the\nsolemn roll of the billows. I thought I had never heard so boding a\nsound; a sound that seemed to speak of judgment and the resurrection,\nlike belfry-mouthed Paul of Tarsus.\nIt was not in the direction of the shore; but seemed to come out of the\nvaults of the sea, and out of the mist and fog.\nWho was dead, and what could it be?\nI soon learned from my shipmates, that this was the famous _Bett-Buoy,_\nwhich is precisely what its name implies; and tolls fast or slow,\naccording to the agitation of the waves. In a calm, it is dumb; in a\nmoderate breeze, it tolls gently; but in a gale, it is an alarum like\nthe tocsin, warning all mariners to flee. But it seemed fuller of\ndirges for the past, than of monitions for the future; and no one can\ngive ear to it, without thinking of the sailors who sleep far beneath\nit at the bottom of the deep.\nAs we sailed ahead the river contracted. The day came, and soon,\npassing two lofty land-marks on the Lancashire shore, we rapidly drew\nnear the town, and at last, came to anchor in the stream.\nLooking shoreward, I beheld lofty ranges of dingy warehouses, which\nseemed very deficient in the elements of the marvelous; and bore a most\nunexpected resemblance to the ware-houses along South-street in New\nYork. There was nothing strange; nothing extraordinary about them.\nThere they stood; a row of calm and collected ware-houses; very good\nand substantial edifices, doubtless, and admirably adapted to the ends\nhad in view by the builders; but plain, matter-of-fact ware-houses,\nnevertheless, and that was all that could be said of them.\nTo be sure, I did not expect that every house in Liverpool must be a\nLeaning Tower of Pisa, or a Strasbourg Cathedral; but yet, these\nedifices I must confess, were a sad and bitter disappointment to me.\nBut it was different with Larry the whaleman; who to my surprise,\nlooking about him delighted, exclaimed, \u201cWhy, this \u2019ere is a\nconsiderable place\u2014I\u2019m _dummed if_ it ain\u2019t quite a place.\u2014Why, them\n\u2019ere houses is considerable houses. It beats the coast of Afriky, all\nhollow; nothing like this in _Madagasky,_ I tell you;\u2014I\u2019m _dummed,_\nboys if Liverpool ain\u2019t a city!\u201d\nUpon this occasion, indeed, Larry altogether forgot his hostility to\ncivilization. Having been so long accustomed to associate foreign lands\nwith the savage places of the Indian Ocean, he had been under the\nimpression, that Liverpool must be a town of bamboos, situated in some\nswamp, and whose inhabitants turned their attention principally to the\ncultivation of log-wood and curing of flying-fish. For that any great\ncommercial city existed three thousand miles from home, was a thing, of\nwhich Larry had never before had a _\u201crealizing sense.\u201d_ He was\naccordingly astonished and delighted; and began to feel a sort of\nconsideration for the country which could boast so extensive a town.\nInstead of holding Queen Victoria on a par with the Queen of\nMadagascar, as he had been accustomed to do; he ever after alluded to\nthat lady with feeling and respect.\nAs for the other seamen, the sight of a foreign country seemed to\nkindle no enthusiasm in them at all: no emotion in the least. They\nlooked around them with great presence of mind, and acted precisely as\nyou or I would, if, after a morning\u2019s absence round the corner, we\nfound ourselves returning home. Nearly all of them had made frequent\nvoyages to Liverpool.\nNot long after anchoring, several boats came off; and from one of them\nstept a neatly-dressed and very respectable-looking woman, some thirty\nyears of age, I should think, carrying a bundle. Coming forward among\nthe sailors, she inquired for Max the Dutchman, who immediately was\nforthcoming, and saluted her by the mellifluous appellation of _Sally._\nNow during the passage, Max in discoursing to me of Liverpool, had\noften assured me, that that city had the honor of containing a spouse\nof his; and that in all probability, I would have the pleasure of\nseeing her. But having heard a good many stories about the bigamies of\nseamen, and their having wives and sweethearts in every port, the round\nworld over; and having been an eye-witness to a nuptial parting between\nthis very Max and a lady in New York; I put down this relation of his,\nfor what I thought it might reasonably be worth. What was my\nastonishment, therefore, to see this really decent, civil woman coming\nwith a neat parcel of Max\u2019s shore clothes, all washed, plaited, and\nironed, and ready to put on at a moment\u2019s warning.\nThey stood apart a few moments giving loose to those transports of\npleasure, which always take place, I suppose, between man and wife\nafter long separations.\nAt last, after many earnest inquiries as to how he had behaved himself\nin New York; and concerning the state of his wardrobe; and going down\ninto the forecastle, and inspecting it in person, Sally departed;\nhaving exchanged her bundle of clean clothes for a bundle of soiled\nones, and this was precisely what the New York wife had done for Max,\nnot thirty days previous.\nSo long as we laid in port, Sally visited the Highlander daily; and\napproved herself a neat and expeditious getter-up of duck frocks and\ntrowsers, a capital tailoress, and as far as I could see, a very\nwell-behaved, discreet, and reputable woman.\nBut from all I had seen of her, I should suppose Meg, the New York\nwife, to have been equally well-behaved, discreet, and reputable; and\nequally devoted to the keeping in good order Max\u2019s wardrobe.\nAnd when we left England at last, Sally bade Max good-by, just as Meg\nhad done; and when we arrived at New York, Meg greeted Max precisely as\nSally had greeted him in Liverpool. Indeed, a pair of more amiable\nwives never belonged to one man; they never quarreled, or had so much\nas a difference of any kind; the whole broad Atlantic being between\nthem; and Max was equally polite and civil to both. For many years, he\nhad been going Liverpool and New York voyages, plying between wife and\nwife with great regularity, and sure of receiving a hearty domestic\nwelcome on either side of the ocean.\nThinking this conduct of his, however, altogether wrong and every way\nimmoral, I once ventured to express to him my opinion on the subject.\nBut I never did so again. He turned round on me, very savagely; and\nafter rating me soundly for meddling in concerns not my own, concluded\nby asking me triumphantly, whether _old King Sol,_ as he called the son\nof David, did not have a whole frigate-full of wives; and that being\nthe case, whether he, a poor sailor, did not have just as good a right\nto have two? \u201cWhat was not wrong then, is right now,\u201d said Max; \u201cso,\nmind your eye, Buttons, or I\u2019ll crack your pepper-box for you!\u201d\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\nHE GOES TO SUPPER AT THE SIGN OF THE BALTIMORE CLIPPER\nIn the afternoon our pilot was all alive with his orders; we hove up\nthe anchor, and after a deal of pulling, and hauling, and jamming\nagainst other ships, we wedged our way through a lock at high tide; and\nabout dark, succeeded in working up to a berth in _Prince\u2019s Dock._ The\nhawsers and tow-lines being then coiled away, the crew were told to go\nashore, select their boarding-house, and sit down to supper.\nHere it must be mentioned, that owing to the strict but necessary\nregulations of the Liverpool docks, no fires of any kind are allowed on\nboard the vessels within them; and hence, though the sailors are\nsupposed to sleep in the forecastle, yet they must get their meals\nashore, or live upon cold potatoes. To a ship, the American merchantmen\nadopt the former plan; the owners, of course, paying the landlord\u2019s\nbill; which, in a large crew remaining at Liverpool more than six\nweeks, as we of the Highlander did, forms no inconsiderable item in the\nexpenses of the voyage. Other ships, however\u2014the economical Dutch and\nDanish, for instance, and sometimes the prudent Scotch\u2014feed their\nluckless tars in dock, with precisely the same fare which they give\nthem at sea; taking their salt junk ashore to be cooked, which, indeed,\nis but scurvy sort of treatment, since it is very apt to induce the\nscurvy. A parsimonious proceeding like this is regarded with\nimmeasurable disdain by the crews of the New York vessels, who, if\ntheir captains treated them after that fashion, would soon bolt and\nrun.\nIt was quite dark, when we all sprang ashore; and, for the first time,\nI felt dusty particles of the renowned British soil penetrating into my\neyes and lungs. As for _stepping_ on it, that was out of the question,\nin the well-paved and flagged condition of the streets; and I did not\nhave an opportunity to do so till some time afterward, when I got out\ninto the country; and then, indeed, I saw England, and snuffed its\nimmortal loam\u2014but not till then.\nJackson led the van; and after stopping at a tavern, took us up this\nstreet, and down that, till at last he brought us to a narrow lane,\nfilled with boarding-houses, spirit-vaults, and sailors. Here we\nstopped before the sign of a Baltimore Clipper, flanked on one side by\na gilded bunch of grapes and a bottle, and on the other by the British\nUnicorn and American Eagle, lying down by each other, like the lion and\nlamb in the millennium.\u2014A very judicious and tasty device, showing a\ndelicate apprehension of the propriety of conciliating American sailors\nin an English boarding-house; and yet in no way derogating from the\nhonor and dignity of England, but placing the two nations, indeed, upon\na footing of perfect equality.\nNear the unicorn was a very small animal, which at first I took for a\nyoung unicorn; but it looked more like a yearling lion. It was holding\nup one paw, as if it had a splinter in it; and on its head was a sort\nof basket-hilted, low-crowned hat, without a rim. I asked a sailor\nstanding by, what this animal meant, when, looking at me with a grin,\nhe answered, \u201cWhy, youngster, don\u2019t you know what that means? It\u2019s a\nyoung jackass, limping off with a kedgeree pot of rice out of the\ncuddy.\u201d\nThough it was an English boarding-house, it was kept by a broken-down\nAmerican mariner, one Danby, a dissolute, idle fellow, who had married\na buxom English wife, and now lived upon her industry; for the lady,\nand not the sailor, proved to be the head of the establishment.\nShe was a hale, good-looking woman, about forty years old, and among\nthe seamen went by the name of _\u201cHandsome Mary.\u201d_ But though, from the\ndissipated character of her spouse, Mary had become the business\npersonage of the house, bought the marketing, overlooked the tables,\nand conducted all the more important arrangements, yet she was by no\nmeans an Amazon to her husband, if she _did_ play a masculine part in\nother matters. No; and the more is the pity, poor Mary seemed too much\nattached to Danby, to seek to rule him as a termagant. Often she went\nabout her household concerns with the tears in her eyes, when, after a\nfit of intoxication, this brutal husband of hers had been beating her.\nThe sailors took her part, and many a time volunteered to give him a\nthorough thrashing before her eyes; but Mary would beg them not to do\nso, as Danby would, no doubt, be a better boy next time.\nBut there seemed no likelihood of this, so long as that abominable bar\nof his stood upon the premises. As you entered the passage, it stared\nupon you on one side, ready to entrap all guests.\nIt was a grotesque, old-fashioned, castellated sort of a sentry-box,\nmade of a smoky-colored wood, and with a grating in front, that lifted\nup like a portcullis. And here would this Danby sit all the day long;\nand when customers grew thin, would patronize his own ale himself,\npouring down mug after mug, as if he took himself for one of his own\nquarter-casks.\nSometimes an old crony of his, one Bob Still, would come in; and then\nthey would occupy the sentry-box together, and swill their beer in\nconcert. This pot-friend of Danby was portly as a dray-horse, and had a\nround, sleek, oily head, twinkling eyes, and moist red cheeks. He was a\nlusty troller of ale-songs; and, with his mug in his hand, would lean\nhis waddling bulk partly out of the sentry-box, singing:\n\u201cNo frost, no snow, no wind, I trow,\nCan hurt me if I wold,\nI am so wrapt, and thoroughly lapt\nIn jolly good ale and old,\u2014\nI stuff my skin so full within,\nOf jolly good ale and old.\u201d\nOr this,\n\u201cFour wines and brandies I detest,\nHere\u2019s richer juice from barley press\u2019d.\nIt is the quintessence of malt,\nAnd they that drink it want no salt.\nCome, then, quick come, and take this beer,\nAnd water henceforth you\u2019ll forswear.\u201d\nAlas! Handsome Mary. What avail all thy private tears and remonstrances\nwith the incorrigible Danby, so long as that brewery of a toper, Bob\nStill, daily eclipses thy threshold with the vast diameter of his\npaunch, and enthrones himself in the sentry-box, holding divided rule\nwith thy spouse?\nThe more he drinks, the fatter and rounder waxes Bob; and the songs\npour out as the ale pours in, on the well-known principle, that the air\nin a vessel is displaced and expelled, as the liquid rises higher and\nhigher in it.\nBut as for Danby, the miserable Yankee grows sour on good cheer, and\ndries up the thinner for every drop of fat ale he imbibes. It is plain\nand demonstrable, that much ale is not good for Yankees, and operates\ndifferently upon them from what it does upon a Briton: ale must be\ndrank in a fog and a drizzle.\nEntering the sign of the Clipper, Jackson ushered us into a small room\non one side, and shortly after, Handsome Mary waited upon us with a\ncourtesy, and received the compliments of several old guests among our\ncrew. She then disappeared to provide our supper. While my shipmates\nwere now engaged in tippling, and talking with numerous old\nacquaintances of theirs in the neighborhood, who thronged about the\ndoor, I remained alone in the little room, meditating profoundly upon\nthe fact, that I was now seated upon an English bench, under an English\nroof, in an English tavern, forming an integral part of the English\nempire. It was a staggering fact, but none the less true.\nI examined the place attentively; it was a long, narrow, little room,\nwith one small arched window with red curtains, looking out upon a\nsmoky, untidy yard, bounded by a dingy brick-wall, the top of which was\nhorrible with pieces of broken old bottles, stuck into mortar.\nA dull lamp swung overhead, placed in a wooden ship suspended from the\nceiling. The walls were covered with a paper, representing an endless\nsuccession of vessels of all nations continually circumnavigating the\napartment. By way of a pictorial mainsail to one of these ships, a map\nwas hung against it, representing in faded colors the flags of all\nnations. From the street came a confused uproar of ballad-singers,\nbawling women, babies, and drunken sailors.\nAnd this is England?\nBut where are the old abbeys, and the York Minsters, and the lord\nmayors, and coronations, and the May-poles, and fox-hunters, and Derby\nraces, and the dukes and duchesses, and the Count d\u2019Orsays, which, from\nall my reading, I had been in the habit of associating with England?\nNot the most distant glimpse of them was to be seen.\nAlas! Wellingborough, thought I, I fear you stand but a poor chance to\nsee the sights. You are nothing but a poor sailor boy; and the Queen is\nnot going to send a deputation of noblemen to invite you to St.\nJames\u2019s.\nIt was then, I began to see, that my prospects of seeing the world as a\nsailor were, after all, but very doubtful; for sailors only go _round_\nthe world, without going _into_ it; and their reminiscences of travel\nare only a dim recollection of a chain of tap-rooms surrounding the\nglobe, parallel with the Equator. They but touch the perimeter of the\ncircle; hover about the edges of terra-firma; and only land upon\nwharves and pier-heads. They would dream as little of traveling inland\nto see Kenilworth, or Blenheim Castle, as they would of sending a car\noverland to the Pope, when they touched at Naples.\nFrom these reveries I was soon roused, by a servant girl hurrying from\nroom to room, in shrill tones exclaiming, \u201cSupper, supper ready.\u201d\nMounting a rickety staircase, we entered a room on the second floor.\nThree tall brass candlesticks shed a smoky light upon smoky walls, of\nwhat had once been sea-blue, covered with sailor-scrawls of foul\nanchors, lovers\u2019 sonnets, and ocean ditties. On one side, nailed\nagainst the wainscot in a row, were the four knaves of cards, each Jack\nputting his best foot foremost as usual. What these signified I never\nheard.\nBut such ample cheer! Such a groaning table! Such a superabundance of\nsolids and substantial! Was it possible that sailors fared thus?\u2014the\nsailors, who at sea live upon salt beef and biscuit?\nFirst and foremost, was a mighty pewter dish, big as Achilles\u2019 shield,\nsustaining a pyramid of smoking sausages. This stood at one end; midway\nwas a similar dish, heavily laden with farmers\u2019 slices of head-cheese;\nand at the opposite end, a congregation of beef-steaks, piled tier over\ntier. Scattered at intervals between, were side dishes of boiled\npotatoes, eggs by the score, bread, and pickles; and on a stand\nadjoining, was an ample reserve of every thing on the supper table.\nWe fell to with all our hearts; wrapt ourselves in hot jackets of\nbeef-steaks; curtailed the sausages with great celerity; and sitting\ndown before the head-cheese, soon razed it to its foundations.\nToward the close of the entertainment, I suggested to Peggy, one of the\ngirls who had waited upon us, that a cup of tea would be a nice thing\nto take; and I would thank her for one. She replied that it was too\nlate for tea; but she would get me a cup of _\u201cswipes\u201d_ if I wanted it.\nNot knowing what _\u201cswipes\u201d_ might be, I thought I would run the risk\nand try it; but it proved a miserable beverage, with a musty, sour\nflavor, as if it had been a decoction of spoiled pickles. I never\npatronized _swipes_ again; but gave it a wide berth; though, at dinner\nafterward, it was furnished to an unlimited extent, and drunk by most\nof my shipmates, who pronounced it good.\nBut Bob Still would not have pronounced it so; for this _stripes, as I_\nlearned, was a sort of cheap substitute for beer; or a bastard kind of\nbeer; or the washings and rinsings of old beer-barrels. But I do not\nremember now what they said it was, precisely. I only know, that\n_swipes_ was my abomination. As for the taste of it, I can only\ndescribe it as answering to the name itself; which is certainly\nsignificant of something vile. But it is drunk in large quantities by\nthe poor people about Liverpool, which, perhaps, in some degree,\naccounts for their poverty.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\nREDBURN DEFERENTIALLY DISCOURSES CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS OF SAILORS\nThe ship remained in Prince\u2019s Dock over six weeks; but as I do not mean\nto present a diary of my stay there, I shall here simply record the\ngeneral tenor of the life led by our crew during that interval; and\nwill then proceed to note down, at random, my own wanderings about\ntown, and impressions of things as they are recalled to me now, after\nthe lapse of so many years.\nBut first, I must mention that we saw little of the captain during our\nstay in the dock. Sometimes, cane in hand, he sauntered down of a\npleasant morning from the _Arms Hotel_, I believe it was, where he\nboarded; and after lounging about the ship, giving orders to his Prime\nMinister and Grand Vizier, the chief mate, he would saunter back to his\ndrawing-rooms.\nFrom the glimpse of a play-bill, which I detected peeping out of his\npocket, I inferred that he patronized the theaters; and from the flush\nof his cheeks, that he patronized the fine old Port wine, for which\nLiverpool is famous.\nOccasionally, however, he spent his nights on board; and mad,\nroystering nights they were, such as rare Ben Jonson would have\ndelighted in. For company over the cabin-table, he would have four or\nfive whiskered sea-captains, who kept the steward drawing corks and\nfilling glasses all the time. And once, the whole company were found\nunder the table at four o\u2019clock in the morning, and were put to bed and\ntucked in by the two mates. Upon this occasion, I agreed with our\nwoolly Doctor of Divinity, the black cook, that they should have been\nashamed of themselves; but there is no shame in some sea-captains, who\nonly blush after the third bottle.\nDuring the many visits of Captain Riga to the ship, he always said\nsomething courteous to a gentlemanly, friendless custom-house officer,\nwho staid on board of us nearly all the time we lay in the dock.\nAnd weary days they must have been to this friendless custom-house\nofficer; trying to kill time in the cabin with a newspaper; and rapping\non the transom with his knuckles. He was kept on board to prevent\nsmuggling; but he used to smuggle himself ashore very often, when,\naccording to law, he should have been at his post on board ship. But no\nwonder; he seemed to be a man of fine feelings, altogether above his\nsituation; a most inglorious one, indeed; worse than driving geese to\nwater.\nAnd now, to proceed with the crew.\nAt daylight, all hands were called, and the decks were washed down;\nthen we had an hour to go ashore to breakfast; after which we worked at\nthe rigging, or picked oakum, or were set to some employment or other,\nnever mind how trivial, till twelve o\u2019clock, when we went to dinner. At\nhalf-past nine we resumed work; and finally _knocked off_ at four\no\u2019clock in the afternoon, unless something particular was in hand. And\nafter four o\u2019clock, we could go where we pleased, and were not required\nto be on board again till next morning at daylight.\nAs we had nothing to do with the cargo, of course, our duties were\nlight enough; and the chief mate was often put to it to devise some\nemployment for us.\nWe had no watches to stand, a ship-keeper, hired from shore, relieving\nus from that; and all the while the men\u2019s wages ran on, as at sea.\nSundays we had to ourselves.\nThus, it will be seen, that the life led by sailors of American ships\nin Liverpool, is an exceedingly easy one, and abounding in leisure.\nThey live ashore on the fat of the land; and after a little wholesome\nexercise in the morning, have the rest of the day to themselves.\nNevertheless, these Liverpool voyages, likewise those to London and\nHavre, are the least profitable that an improvident seaman can take.\nBecause, in New York he receives his month\u2019s advance; in Liverpool,\nanother; both of which, in most cases, quickly disappear; so that by\nthe time his voyage terminates, he generally has but little coming to\nhim; sometimes not a cent. Whereas, upon a long voyage, say to India or\nChina, his wages accumulate; he has more inducements to economize, and\nfar fewer motives to extravagance; and when he is paid off at last, he\ngoes away jingling a quart measure of dollars.\nBesides, of all sea-ports in the world, Liverpool, perhaps, most\nabounds in all the variety of land-sharks, land-rats, and other vermin,\nwhich make the hapless mariner their prey. In the shape of landlords,\nbar-keepers, clothiers, crimps, and boarding-house loungers, the\nland-sharks devour him, limb by limb; while the land-rats and mice\nconstantly nibble at his purse.\nOther perils he runs, also, far worse; from the denizens of notorious\nCorinthian haunts in the vicinity of the docks, which in depravity are\nnot to be matched by any thing this side of the pit that is bottomless.\nAnd yet, sailors love this Liverpool; and upon long voyages to distant\nparts of the globe, will be continually dilating upon its charms and\nattractions, and extolling it above all other seaports in the world.\nFor in Liverpool they find their Paradise\u2014not the well known street of\nthat name\u2014and one of them told me he would be content to lie in\nPrince\u2019s Dock till _he hove up anchor_ for the world to come.\nMuch is said of ameliorating the condition of sailors; but it must ever\nprove a most difficult endeavor, so long as the antidote is given\nbefore the bane is removed.\nConsider, that, with the majority of them, the very fact of their being\nsailors, argues a certain recklessness and sensualism of character,\nignorance, and depravity; consider that they are generally friendless\nand alone in the world; or if they have friends and relatives, they are\nalmost constantly beyond the reach of their good influences; consider\nthat after the rigorous discipline, hardships, dangers, and privations\nof a voyage, they are set adrift in a foreign port, and exposed to a\nthousand enticements, which, under the circumstances, would be hard\neven for virtue itself to withstand, unless virtue went about on\ncrutches; consider that by their very vocation they are shunned by the\nbetter classes of people, and cut off from all access to respectable\nand improving society; consider all this, and the reflecting mind must\nvery soon perceive that the case of sailors, as a class, is not a very\npromising one.\nIndeed, the bad things of their condition come under the head of those\nchronic evils which can only be ameliorated, it would seem, by\nameliorating the moral organization of all civilization.\nThough old seventy-fours and old frigates are converted into chapels,\nand launched into the docks; though the \u201cBoatswain\u2019s Mate\u201d and other\nclever religious tracts in the nautical dialect are distributed among\nthem; though clergymen harangue them from the pier-heads: and chaplains\nin the navy read sermons to them on the gun-deck; though evangelical\nboarding-houses are provided for them; though the parsimony of\nship-owners has seconded the really sincere and pious efforts of\nTemperance Societies, to take away from seamen their old rations of\ngrog while at sea:\u2014notwithstanding all these things, and many more, the\nrelative condition of the great bulk of sailors to the rest of mankind,\nseems to remain pretty much where it was, a century ago.\nIt is too much the custom, perhaps, to regard as a special advance,\nthat unavoidable, and merely participative progress, which any one\nclass makes in sharing the general movement of the race. Thus, because\nthe sailor, who to-day steers the Hibernia or Unicorn steam-ship across\nthe Atlantic, is a somewhat different man from the exaggerated sailors\nof Smollett, and the men who fought with Nelson at Copenhagen, and\nsurvived to riot themselves away at North Corner in Plymouth;\u2014because\nthe modem tar is not quite so gross as heretofore, and has shaken off\nsome of his shaggy jackets, and docked his Lord Rodney\nqueue:\u2014therefore, in the estimation of some observers, he has begun to\nsee the evils of his condition, and has voluntarily improved. But upon\na closer scrutiny, it will be seen that he has but drifted along with\nthat great tide, which, perhaps, has two flows for one ebb; he has made\nno individual advance of his own.\nThere are classes of men in the world, who bear the same relation to\nsociety at large, that the wheels do to a coach: and are just as\nindispensable. But however easy and delectable the springs upon which\nthe insiders pleasantly vibrate: however sumptuous the hammer-cloth,\nand glossy the door-panels; yet, for all this, the wheels must still\nrevolve in dusty, or muddy revolutions. No contrivance, no sagacity can\nlift _them_ out of the mire; for upon something the coach must be\nbottomed; on something the insiders must roll.\nNow, sailors form one of these wheels: they go and come round the\nglobe; they are the true importers, and exporters of spices and silks;\nof fruits and wines and marbles; they carry missionaries, embassadors,\nopera-singers, armies, merchants, tourists, and scholars to their\ndestination: they are a bridge of boats across the Atlantic; they are\nthe _primum mobile_ of all commerce; and, in short, were they to\nemigrate in a body to man the navies of the moon, almost every thing\nwould stop here on earth except its revolution on its axis, and the\norators in the American Congress.\nAnd yet, what are sailors? What in your heart do you think of that\nfellow staggering along the dock? Do you not give him a wide berth,\nshun him, and account him but little above the brutes that perish? Will\nyou throw open your parlors to him; invite him to dinner? or give him a\nseason ticket to your pew in church?\u2014No. You will do no such thing; but\nat a distance, you will perhaps subscribe a dollar or two for the\nbuilding of a hospital, to accommodate sailors already broken down; or\nfor the distribution of excellent books among tars who can not read.\nAnd the very mode and manner in which such charities are made, bespeak,\nmore than words, the low estimation in which sailors are held. It is\nuseless to gainsay it; they are deemed almost the refuse and\noffscourings of the earth; and the romantic view of them is principally\nhad through romances.\nBut can sailors, one of the wheels of this world, be wholly lifted up\nfrom the mire? There seems not much chance for it, in the old systems\nand programmes of the future, however well-intentioned and sincere; for\nwith such systems, the thought of lifting them up seems almost as\nhopeless as that of growing the grape in Nova Zembla.\nBut we must not altogether despair for the sailor; nor need those who\ntoil for his good be at bottom disheartened, or Time must prove his\nfriend in the end; and though sometimes he would almost seem as a\nneglected step-son of heaven, permitted to run on and riot out his days\nwith no hand to restrain him, while others are watched over and\ntenderly cared for; yet we feel and we know that God is the true Father\nof all, and that none of his children are without the pale of his care.\nCHAPTER XXX.\nREDBURN GROWS INTOLERABLY FLAT AND STUPID OVER SOME OUTLANDISH OLD\nGUIDE-BOOKS\nAmong the odd volumes in my father\u2019s library, was a collection of old\nEuropean and English guide-books, which he had bought on his travels, a\ngreat many years ago. In my childhood, I went through many courses of\nstudying them, and never tired of gazing at the numerous quaint\nembellishments and plates, and staring at the strange title-pages, some\nof which I thought resembled the mustached faces of foreigners. Among\nothers was a Parisian-looking, faded, pink-covered pamphlet, the rouge\nhere and there effaced upon its now thin and attenuated cheeks,\nentitled, _\u201cVoyage Descriptif et Philosophique de L\u2019Ancien et du\nNouveau Paris: Miroir Fid\u00e8le\u201d_ also a time-darkened, mossy old book, in\nmarbleized binding, much resembling verd-antique, entitled,\n_\u201cItin\u00e9raire Instructif de Rome, ou Description G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Monumens\nAntiques et Modernes et des Ouvrages les plus Remarquables de Peinteur,\nde Sculpture, et de Architecture de cette C\u00e9l\u00e9bre Ville;\u201d_ on the\nrusset title-page is a vignette representing a barren rock, partly\nshaded by a scrub-oak (a forlorn bit of landscape), and under the lee\nof the rock and the shade of the tree, maternally reclines the\nhouseless foster-mother of Romulus and Remus, giving suck to the\nillustrious twins; a pair of naked little cherubs sprawling on the\nground, with locked arms, eagerly engaged at their absorbing\noccupation; a large cactus-leaf or diaper hangs from a bough, and the\nwolf looks a good deal like one of the no-horn breed of barn-yard cows;\nthe work is published _\u201cAvec privilege du Souverain Pontife.\u201d_ There\nwas also a velvet-bound old volume, in brass clasps, entitled, _\u201cThe\nConductor through Holland\u201d_ with a plate of the Stadt House; also a\nvenerable _\u201cPicture of London\u201d_ abounding in representations of St.\nPaul\u2019s, the Monument, Temple-Bar, Hyde-Park-Corner, the Horse Guards,\nthe Admiralty, Charing-Cross, and Vauxhall Bridge. Also, a bulky book,\nin a dusty-looking yellow cover, reminding one of the paneled doors of\na mail-coach, and bearing an elaborate title-page, full of printer\u2019s\nflourishes, in emulation of the cracks of a four-in-hand whip,\nentitled, in part, _\u201cThe Great Roads, both direct and cross, throughout\nEngland and Wales, from an actual Admeasurement by order of His\nMajesty\u2019s Postmaster-General: This work describes the Cities, Market\nand Borough and Corporate Towns, and those at which the Assizes are\nheld, and gives the time of the Mails\u2019 arrival and departure from each:\nDescribes the Inns in the Metropolis from which the stages go, and the\nInns in the country which supply post-horses and carriages: Describes\nthe Noblemen and Gentlemen\u2019s Seats situated near the Road, with Maps of\nthe Environs of London, Bath, Brighton, and Margate.\u201d_ It is dedicated\n_\u201cTo the Right Honorable the Earls of Chesterfield and Leicester, by\ntheir Lordships\u2019 Most Obliged, Obedient, and Obsequious Servant, John\nGary,_ 1798.\u201d Also a green pamphlet, with a motto from Virgil, and an\nintricate coat of arms on the cover, looking like a diagram of the\nLabyrinth of Crete, entitled, \u201cA _Description of York, its Antiquities\nand Public Buildings, particularly the Cathedral; compiled with great\npains from the most authentic records.\u201d_ Also a small\nscholastic-looking volume, in a classic vellum binding, and with a\nfrontispiece bringing together at one view the towers and turrets of\nKing\u2019s College and the magnificent Cathedral of Ely, though\ngeographically sixteen miles apart, entitled, _\u201cThe Cambridge Guide:\nits Colleges, Halls, Libraries, and Museums, with the Ceremonies of the\nTown and University, and some account of Ely Cathedral.\u201d_ Also a\npamphlet, with a japanned sort of cover, stamped with a disorderly\nhiggledy-piggledy group of pagoda-looking structures, claiming to be an\naccurate representation of the _\u201cNorth or Grand Front of Blenheim,\u201d_\nand entitled, \u201cA _Description of Blenheim, the Seat of His Grace the\nDuke of Marlborough; containing a full account of the Paintings,\nTapestry, and Furniture: a Picturesque Tour of the Gardens and Parks,\nand a General Description of the famous China Gallery,_ &.; _with an\nEssay on Landscape Gardening: and embellished with a View of the\nPalace, and a New and Elegant Plan of the Great Park.\u201d_ And lastly, and\nto the purpose, there was a volume called \u201cTHE PICTURE OF LIVERPOOL.\u201d\nIt was a curious and remarkable book; and from the many fond\nassociations connected with it, I should like to immortalize it, if I\ncould.\nBut let me get it down from its shrine, and paint it, if I may, from\nthe life.\nAs I now linger over the volume, to and fro turning the pages so dear\nto my boyhood,\u2014the very pages which, years and years ago, my father\nturned over amid the very scenes that are here described; what a soft,\npleasing sadness steals over me, and how I melt into the past and\nforgotten!\nDear book! I will sell my Shakespeare, and even sacrifice my old quarto\nHogarth, before I will part with you. Yes, I will go to the hammer\nmyself, ere I send you to be knocked down in the auctioneer\u2019s shambles.\nI will, my beloved,\u2014old family relic that you are;\u2014till you drop leaf\nfrom leaf, and letter from letter, you shall have a snug shelf\nsomewhere, though I have no bench for myself.\nIn size, it is what the booksellers call an _18mo;_ it is bound in\ngreen morocco, which from my earliest recollection has been spotted and\ntarnished with time; the corners are marked with triangular patches of\nred, like little cocked hats; and some unknown Goth has inflicted an\nincurable wound upon the back. There is no lettering outside; so that\nhe who lounges past my humble shelves, seldom dreams of opening the\nanonymous little book in green. There it stands; day after day, week\nafter week, year after year; and no one but myself regards it. But I\nmake up for all neglects, with my own abounding love for it.\nBut let us open the volume.\nWhat are these scrawls in the fly-leaves? what incorrigible pupil of a\nwriting-master has been here? what crayon sketcher of wild animals and\nfalling air-castles? Ah, no!\u2014these are all part and parcel of the\nprecious book, which go to make up the sum of its treasure to me.\nSome of the scrawls are my own; and as poets do with their juvenile\nsonnets, I might write under this horse, _\u201cDrawn at the age of three\nyears,\u201d_ and under this autograph, _\u201cExecuted at the age of eight.\u201d_\nOthers are the handiwork of my brothers, and sisters, and cousins; and\nthe hands that sketched some of them are now moldered away.\nBut what does this anchor here? this ship? and this sea-ditty of\nDibdin\u2019s? The book must have fallen into the hands of some tarry\ncaptain of a forecastle. No: that anchor, ship, and Dibdin\u2019s ditty are\nmine; this hand drew them; and on this very voyage to Liverpool. But\nnot so fast; I did not mean to tell that yet.\nFull in the midst of these pencil scrawlings, completely surrounded\nindeed, stands in indelible, though faded ink, and in my father\u2019s\nhand-writing, the following:\u2014\nWALTER REDBURN.\nRiddough\u2019s Royal Hotel,\nLiverpool, March 20th, 1808.\nTurning over that leaf, I come upon some half-effaced miscellaneous\nmemoranda in pencil, characteristic of a methodical mind, and therefore\nindubitably my father\u2019s, which he must have made at various times\nduring his stay in Liverpool. These are full of a strange, subdued,\nold, midsummer interest to me: and though, from the numerous\neffacements, it is much like cross-reading to make them out; yet, I\nmust here copy a few at random:\u2014\n\u00a3     s.     d\n_Guide-Book_                                3      6\n_Dinner at the Star and Garter_                   10\n_Trip to Preston (distance 31 m.)_    2     6      3\n_Gratuities_                                       4\n_Hack_                                      4      6\n_Thompson\u2019s Seasons_                               5\n_Library_                                          1\n_Boat on the river_                                6\n_Port wine and cigar_                              4\nAnd on the opposite page, I can just decipher the following:\n_Dine with Mr. Roscoe on Monday._\n_Call upon Mr. Morille same day._\n_Leave card at Colonel Digby\u2019s on Tuesday._\n_Theatre Friday night\u2014Richard III. and new farce._\n_Present letter at Miss L\u2014\u2014\u2019s on Tuesday._\n_Call on Sampson & Wilt, Friday._\n_Get my draft on London cashed._\n_Write home by the Princess._\n_Letter bag at Sampson and Wilt\u2019s._\nTurning over the next leaf, I unfold a map, which in the midst of the\nBritish Arms, in one corner displays in sturdy text, that this is _\u201cA\nPlan of the Town of Liverpool.\u201d_ But there seems little plan in the\nconfined and crooked looking marks for the streets, and the docks\nirregularly scattered along the bank of the Mersey, which flows along,\na peaceful stream of shaded line engraving.\nOn the northeast corner of the map, lies a level Sahara of yellowish\nwhite: a desert, which still bears marks of my zeal in endeavoring to\npopulate it with all manner of uncouth monsters in crayons. The space\ndesignated by that spot is now, doubtless, completely built up in\nLiverpool.\nTraced with a pen, I discover a number of dotted lines, radiating in\nall directions from the foot of Lord-street, where stands marked\n_\u201cRiddough\u2019s Hotel,\u201d_ the house my father stopped at.\nThese marks delineate his various excursions in the town; and I follow\nthe lines on, through street and lane; and across broad squares; and\npenetrate with them into the narrowest courts.\nBy these marks, I perceive that my father forgot not his religion in a\nforeign land; but attended St. John\u2019s Church near the Hay-market, and\nother places of public worship: I see that he visited the News Room in\nDuke-street, the Lyceum in Bold-street, and the Theater Royal; and that\nhe called to pay his respects to the eminent Mr. Roscoe, the historian,\npoet, and banker.\nReverentially folding this map, I pass a plate of the Town Hall, and\ncome upon the Title Page, which, in the middle, is ornamented with a\npiece of landscape, representing a loosely clad lady in sandals,\npensively seated upon a bleak rock on the sea shore, supporting her\nhead with one hand, and with the other, exhibiting to the stranger an\noval sort of salver, bearing the figure of a strange bird, with this\nmotto elastically stretched for a border\u2014_\u201cDeus nobis haec otia\nfecit.\u201d_\nThe bird forms part of the city arms, and is an imaginary\nrepresentation of a now extinct fowl, called the _\u201cLiver,\u201d_ said to\nhave inhabited a _\u201cpool,\u201d_ which antiquarians assert once covered a\ngood part of the ground where Liverpool now stands; and from that bird,\nand this pool, Liverpool derives its name.\nAt a distance from the pensive lady in sandals, is a ship under full\nsail; and on the beach is the figure of a small man, vainly essaying to\nroll over a huge bale of goods.\nEqually divided at the top and bottom of this design, is the following\ntitle complete; but I fear the printer will not be able to give a\nfacsimile:\u2014\n_The Picture\nof Liverpool:\nor, Stranger\u2019s Guide\nand Gentleman\u2019s Pocket Companion\n_ FOR THE TOWN.\nEmbellished\nWith Engravings\nBy the Most Accomplished and Eminent Artists.\nLiverpool:\nPrinted in Swift\u2019s Court,\nAnd sold by Woodward and Alderson, 56 Castle St. 1803.\nA brief and reverential preface, as if the writer were all the time\nbowing, informs the reader of the flattering reception accorded to\nprevious editions of the work; and quotes _\u201ctestimonies of respect\nwhich had lately appeared in various quarters_ \u2014_the British Critic,\nReview, and the seventh volume of the Beauties of England and\nWales\u201d\u2014_and concludes by expressing the hope, that this new, revised,\nand illustrated edition might _\u201crender it less unworthy of the public\nnotice, and less unworthy also of the subject it is intended to\nillustrate.\u201d_\nA very nice, dapper, and respectful little preface, the time and place\nof writing which is solemnly recorded at the end-Hope _Place, 1st\nSept._ 1803.\nBut how much fuller my satisfaction, as I fondly linger over this\ncircumstantial paragraph, if the writer had recorded the precise hour\nof the day, and by what timepiece; and if he had but mentioned his age,\noccupation, and name.\nBut all is now lost; I know not who he was; and this estimable author\nmust needs share the oblivious fate of all literary incognitos.\nHe must have possessed the grandest and most elevated ideas of true\nfame, since he scorned to be perpetuated by a solitary initial. Could I\nfind him out now, sleeping neglected in some churchyard, I would buy\nhim a headstone, and record upon it naught but his title-page, deeming\nthat his noblest epitaph.\nAfter the preface, the book opens with an extract from a prologue\nwritten by the excellent Dr. Aiken, the brother of Mrs. Barbauld, upon\nthe opening of the Theater Royal, Liverpool, in 1772:\u2014\n_\u201cWhere Mersey\u2019s stream, long winding o\u2019er the plain,\nPours his full tribute to the circling main,\nA band of fishers chose their humble seat;\nContented labor blessed the fair retreat,\nInured to hardship, patient, bold, and rude,\nThey braved the billows for precarious food:\nTheir straggling huts were ranged along the shore,\nTheir nets and little boats their only store.\u201d_\nIndeed, throughout, the work abounds with quaint poetical quotations,\nand old-fashioned classical allusions to the Aeneid and Falconer\u2019s\nShipwreck.\nAnd the anonymous author must have been not only a scholar and a\ngentleman, but a man of gentle disinterestedness, combined with true\ncity patriotism; for in his _\u201cSurvey of__ the Town\u201d_ are nine thickly\nprinted pages of a neglected poem by a neglected Liverpool poet.\nBy way of apologizing for what might seem an obtrusion upon the public\nof so long an episode, he courteously and feelingly introduces it by\nsaying, that _\u201cthe poem has now for several years been scarce, and is\nat present but little known; and hence a very small portion of it will\nno doubt be highly acceptable to the cultivated reader; especially as\nthis noble epic is written with great felicity of expression and the\nsweetest delicacy of feeling.\u201d_\nOnce, but once only, an uncharitable thought crossed my mind, that the\nauthor of the Guide-Book might have been the author of the epic. But\nthat was years ago; and I have never since permitted so uncharitable a\nreflection to insinuate itself into my mind.\nThis epic, from the specimen before me, is composed in the old stately\nstyle, and rolls along commanding as a coach and four. It sings of\nLiverpool and the Mersey; its docks, and ships, and warehouses, and\nbales, and anchors; and after descanting upon the abject times, when\n_\u201chis noble waves, inglorious, Mersey rolled,\u201d_ the poet breaks forth\nlike all Parnassus with:\u2014\n_\u201cNow o\u2019er the wondering world her name resounds,\nFrom northern climes to India\u2019s distant bounds\u2014\nWhere\u2019er his shores the broad Atlantic waves;\nWhere\u2019er the Baltic rolls his wintry waves;\nWhere\u2019er the honored flood extends his tide,\nThat clasps Sicilia like a favored bride.\nGreenland for her its bulky whale resigns,\nAnd temperate Gallia rears her generous vines:\n\u2019Midst warm Iberia citron orchards blow,\nAnd the ripe fruitage bends the laboring bough;\nIn every clime her prosperous fleets are known,\nShe makes the wealth of every clime her own.\u201d_\nIt also contains a delicately-curtained allusion to Mr. Roscoe:\u2014\n_\u201cAnd here_ R*s*o*, _with genius all his own,\nNew tracks explores, and all before unknown?\u201d_\nIndeed, both the anonymous author of the Guide-Book, and the gifted\nbard of the Mersey, seem to have nourished the warmest appreciation of\nthe fact, that to their beloved town Roscoe imparted a reputation which\ngracefully embellished its notoriety as a mere place of commerce. He is\ncalled the modern Guicciardini of the modern Florence, and his\nhistories, translations, and Italian Lives, are spoken of with\nclassical admiration.\nThe first chapter begins in a methodical, business-like way, by\ninforming the impatient reader of the precise latitude and longitude of\nLiverpool; so that, at the outset, there may be no misunderstanding on\nthat head. It then goes on to give an account of the history and\nantiquities of the town, beginning with a record in the _Doomsday-Book_\nof William the Conqueror.\nHere, it must be sincerely confessed, however, that notwithstanding his\nnumerous other merits, my favorite author betrays a want of the\nuttermost antiquarian and penetrating spirit, which would have scorned\nto stop in its researches at the reign of the Norman monarch, but would\nhave pushed on resolutely through the dark ages, up to Moses, the man\nof Uz, and Adam; and finally established the fact beyond a doubt, that\nthe soil of Liverpool was created with the creation.\nBut, perhaps, one of the most curious passages in the chapter of\nantiquarian research, is the pious author\u2019s moralizing reflections upon\nan interesting fact he records: to wit, that in a.d. 1571, the\ninhabitants sent a memorial to Queen Elizabeth, praying relief under a\nsubsidy, wherein they style themselves _\u201cher majesty\u2019s poor decayed\ntown of Liverpool.\u201d_\nAs I now fix my gaze upon this faded and dilapidated old guide-book,\nbearing every token of the ravages of near half a century, and read how\nthis piece of antiquity enlarges like a modern upon previous\nantiquities, I am forcibly reminded that the world is indeed growing\nold. And when I turn to the second chapter, _\u201cOn the increase of the\ntown, and number of inhabitants,\u201d_ and then skim over page after page\nthroughout the volume, all filled with allusions to the immense\ngrandeur of a place, which, since then, has more than quadrupled in\npopulation, opulence, and splendor, and whose present inhabitants must\nlook back upon the period here spoken of with a swelling feeling of\nimmeasurable superiority and pride, I am filled with a comical sadness\nat the vanity of all human exaltation. For the cope-stone of to-day is\nthe corner-stone of tomorrow; and as St. Peter\u2019s church was built in\ngreat part of the ruins of old Rome, so in all our erections, however\nimposing, we but form quarries and supply ignoble materials for the\ngrander domes of posterity.\nAnd even as this old guide-book boasts of the, to us, insignificant\nLiverpool of fifty years ago, the New York guidebooks are now vaunting\nof the magnitude of a town, whose future inhabitants, multitudinous as\nthe pebbles on the beach, and girdled in with high walls and towers,\nflanking endless avenues of opulence and taste, will regard all our\nBroadways and Bowerys as but the paltry nucleus to their Nineveh. From\nfar up the Hudson, beyond Harlem River, where the young saplings are\nnow growing, that will overarch their lordly mansions with broad\nboughs, centuries old; they may send forth explorers to penetrate into\nthe then obscure and smoky alleys of the Fifth Avenue and\nFourteenth-street; and going still farther south, may exhume the\npresent Doric Custom-house, and quote it as a proof that their high and\nmighty metropolis enjoyed a Hellenic antiquity.\nAs I am extremely loth to omit giving a specimen of the dignified style\nof this _\u201cPicture of Liverpool,\u201d_ so different from the brief, pert,\nand unclerkly hand-books to Niagara and Buffalo of the present day, I\nshall now insert the chapter of antiquarian researches; especially as\nit is entertaining in itself, and affords much valuable, and perhaps\nrare information, which the reader may need, concerning the famous\ntown, to which I made _my first voyage._ And I think that with regard\nto a matter, concerning which I myself am wholly ignorant, it is far\nbetter to quote my old friend verbatim, than to mince his substantial\nbaron-of-beef of information into a flimsy ragout of my own; and so,\npass it off as original. Yes, I will render unto my honored guide-book\nits due.\nBut how can the printer\u2019s art so dim and mellow down the pages into a\nsoft sunset yellow; and to the reader\u2019s eye, shed over the type all the\npleasant associations which the original carries to me!\nNo! by my father\u2019s sacred memory, and all sacred privacies of fond\nfamily reminiscences, I will not! I will _not_ quote thee, old Morocco,\nbefore the cold face of the marble-hearted world; for your antiquities\nwould only be skipped and dishonored by shallow-minded readers; and for\nme, I should be charged with swelling out my volume by plagiarizing\nfrom a guide-book-the most vulgar and ignominious of thefts!\nCHAPTER XXXI.\nWITH HIS PROSY OLD GUIDE-BOOK, HE TAKES A PROSY STROLL THROUGH THE TOWN\nWhen I left home, I took the green morocco guide-book along, supposing\nthat from the great number of ships going to Liverpool, I would most\nprobably ship on board of one of them, as the event itself proved.\nGreat was my boyish delight at the prospect of visiting a place, the\ninfallible clew to all whose intricacies I held in my hand.\nOn the passage out I studied its pages a good deal. In the first place,\nI grounded myself thoroughly in the history and antiquities of the\ntown, as set forth in the chapter I intended to quote. Then I mastered\nthe columns of statistics, touching the advance of population; and\npored over them, as I used to do over my multiplication-table. For I\nwas determined to make the whole subject my own; and not be content\nwith a mere smattering of the thing, as is too much the custom with\nmost students of guide-books. Then I perused one by one the elaborate\ndescriptions of public edifices, and scrupulously compared the text\nwith the corresponding engraving, to see whether they corroborated each\nother. For be it known that, including the map, there were no less than\nseventeen plates in the work. And by often examining them, I had so\nimpressed every column and cornice in my mind, that I had no doubt of\nrecognizing the originals in a moment.\nIn short, when I considered that my own father had used this very\nguide-book, and that thereby it had been thoroughly tested, and its\nfidelity proved beyond a peradventure; I could not but think that I was\nbuilding myself up in an unerring knowledge of Liverpool; especially as\nI had familiarized myself with the map, and could turn sharp corners on\nit, with marvelous confidence and celerity.\nIn imagination, as I lay in my berth on ship-board, I used to take\npleasant afternoon rambles through the town; down St. James-street and\nup Great George\u2019s, stopping at various places of interest and\nattraction. I began to think I had been born in Liverpool, so familiar\nseemed all the features of the map. And though some of the streets\nthere depicted were thickly involved, endlessly angular and crooked,\nlike the map of Boston, in Massachusetts, yet, I made no doubt, that I\ncould march through them in the darkest night, and even run for the\nmost distant dock upon a pressing emergency.\nDear delusion!\nIt never occurred to my boyish thoughts, that though a guide-book,\nfifty years old, might have done good service in its day, yet it would\nprove but a miserable cicerone to a modern. I little imagined that the\nLiverpool my father saw, was another Liverpool from that to which I,\nhis son Wellingborough was sailing. No; these things never obtruded; so\naccustomed had I been to associate my old morocco guide-book with the\ntown it described, that the bare thought of there being any\ndiscrepancy, never entered my mind.\nWhile we lay in the Mersey, before entering the dock, I got out my\nguide-book to see how the map would compare with the identical place\nitself. But they bore not the slightest resemblance. However, thinks I,\nthis is owing to my taking a horizontal view, instead of a bird\u2019s-eye\nsurvey. So, never mind old guide-book, _you,_ at least, are all right.\nBut my faith received a severe shock that same evening, when the crew\nwent ashore to supper, as I have previously related.\nThe men stopped at a curious old tavern, near the Prince\u2019s Dock\u2019s\nwalls; and having my guide-book in my pocket, I drew it forth to\ncompare notes, when I found, that precisely upon the spot where I and\nmy shipmates were standing, and a cherry-cheeked bar-maid was filling\ntheir glasses, my infallible old Morocco, in that very place, located a\nfort; adding, that it was well worth the intelligent stranger\u2019s while\nto visit it for the purpose of beholding the guard relieved in the\nevening.\nThis was a staggerer; for how could a tavern be mistaken for a castle?\nand this was about the hour mentioned for the guard to turn out; yet\nnot a red coat was to be seen. But for all this, I could not, for one\nsmall discrepancy, condemn the old family servant who had so faithfully\nserved my own father before me; and when I learned that this tavern\nwent by the name of _\u201cThe Old Fort Tavern;\u201d_ and when I was told that\nmany of the old stones were yet in the walls, I almost completely\nexonerated my guide-book from the half-insinuated charge of misleading\nme.\nThe next day was Sunday, and I had it all to myself; and now, thought\nI, my guide-book and I shall have a famous ramble up street and down\nlane, even unto the furthest limits of this Liverpool.\nI rose bright and early; from head to foot performed my ablutions \u201cwith\nEastern scrupulosity,\u201d and I arrayed myself in my red shirt and\nshooting-jacket, and the sportsman\u2019s pantaloons; and crowned my entire\nman with the tarpaulin; so that from this curious combination of\nclothing, and particularly from my red shirt, I must have looked like a\nvery strange compound indeed: three parts sportsman, and two soldier,\nto one of the sailor.\nMy shipmates, of course, made merry at my appearance; but I heeded them\nnot; and after breakfast, jumped ashore, full of brilliant\nanticipations.\nMy gait was erect, and I was rather tall for my age; and that may have\nbeen the reason why, as I was rapidly walking along the dock, a drunken\nsailor passing, exclaimed, _\u201cEyes right! quick step there!\u201d_\nAnother fellow stopped me to know whether I was going fox-hunting; and\none of the dock-police, stationed at the gates, after peeping out upon\nme from his sentry box, a snug little den, furnished with benches and\nnewspapers, and hung round with storm jackets and oiled capes, issued\nforth in a great hurry, crossed my path as I was emerging into the\nstreet, and commanded me to _halt!_ I obeyed; when scanning my\nappearance pertinaciously, he desired to know where I got that\ntarpaulin hat, not being able to account for the phenomenon of its\nroofing the head of a broken-down fox-hunter. But I pointed to my ship,\nwhich lay at no great distance; when remarking from my voice that I was\na Yankee, this faithful functionary permitted me to pass.\nIt must be known that the police stationed at the gates of the docks\nare extremely observant of strangers going out; as many thefts are\nperpetrated on board the ships; and if they chance to see any thing\nsuspicious, they probe into it without mercy. Thus, the old men who buy\n_\u201cshakings,\u201d_ and rubbish from vessels, must turn their bags wrong side\nout before the police, ere they are allowed to go outside the walls.\nAnd often they will search a suspicious looking fellow\u2019s clothes, even\nif he be a very thin man, with attenuated and almost imperceptible\npockets.\nBut where was I going?\nI will tell. My intention was in the first place, to visit Riddough\u2019s\nHotel, where my father had stopped, more than thirty years before: and\nthen, with the map in my hand, follow him through all the town,\naccording to the dotted lines in the diagram. For thus would I be\nperforming a filial pilgrimage to spots which would be hallowed in my\neyes.\nAt last, when I found myself going down Old Hall-street toward\nLord-street, where the hotel was situated, according to my authority;\nand when, taking out my map, I found that Old Hall-street was marked\nthere, through its whole extent with my father\u2019s pen; a thousand fond,\naffectionate emotions rushed around my heart.\nYes, in this very street, thought I, nay, on this very flagging my\nfather walked. Then I almost wept, when I looked down on my sorry\napparel, and marked how the people regarded me; the men staring at so\ngrotesque a young stranger, and the old ladies, in beaver hats and\nruffles, crossing the walk a little to shun me.\nHow differently my father must have appeared; perhaps in a blue coat,\nbuff vest, and Hessian boots. And little did he think, that a son of\nhis would ever visit Liverpool as a poor friendless sailor-boy. But I\nwas not born then: no, when he walked this flagging, I was not so much\nas thought of; I was not included in the census of the universe. My own\nfather did not know me then; and had never seen, or heard, or so much\nas dreamed of me. And that thought had a touch of sadness to me; for if\nit had certainly been, that my own parent, at one time, never cast a\nthought upon me, how might it be with me hereafter? Poor, poor\nWellingborough! thought I, miserable boy! you are indeed friendless and\nforlorn. Here you wander a stranger in a strange town, and the very\nthought of your father\u2019s having been here before you, but carries with\nit the reflection that, he then knew you not, nor cared for you one\nwhit.\nBut dispelling these dismal reflections as well as I could, I pushed on\nmy way, till I got to Chapel-street, which I crossed; and then, going\nunder a cloister-like arch of stone, whose gloom and narrowness\ndelighted me, and filled my Yankee soul with romantic thoughts of old\nAbbeys and Minsters, I emerged into the fine quadrangle of the\nMerchants\u2019 Exchange.\nThere, leaning against the colonnade, I took out my map, and traced my\nfather right across Chapel-street, and actually through the very arch\nat my back, into the paved square where I stood.\nSo vivid was now the impression of his having been here, and so narrow\nthe passage from which he had emerged, that I felt like running on, and\novertaking him around the Town Hall adjoining, at the head of\nCastle-street. But I soon checked myself, when remembering that he had\ngone whither no son\u2019s search could find him in this world. And then I\nthought of all that must have happened to him since he paced through\nthat arch. What trials and troubles he had encountered; how he had been\nshaken by many storms of adversity, and at last died a bankrupt. I\nlooked at my own sorry garb, and had much ado to keep from tears.\nBut I rallied, and gazed round at the sculptured stonework, and turned\nto my guide-book, and looked at the print of the spot. It was correct\nto a pillar; but wanted the central ornament of the quadrangle. This,\nhowever, was but a slight subsequent erection, which ought not to\nmilitate against the general character of my friend for\ncomprehensiveness.\nThe ornament in question is a group of statuary in bronze, elevated\nupon a marble pedestal and basement, representing Lord Nelson expiring\nin the arms of Victory. One foot rests on a rolling foe, and the other\non a cannon. Victory is dropping a wreath on the dying admiral\u2019s brow;\nwhile Death, under the similitude of a hideous skeleton, is insinuating\nhis bony hand under the hero\u2019s robe, and groping after his heart. A\nvery striking design, and true to the imagination; I never could look\nat Death without a shudder.\nAt uniform intervals round the base of the pedestal, four naked figures\nin chains, somewhat larger than life, are seated in various attitudes\nof humiliation and despair. One has his leg recklessly thrown over his\nknee, and his head bowed over, as if he had given up all hope of ever\nfeeling better. Another has his head buried in despondency, and no\ndoubt looks mournfully out of his eyes, but as his face was averted at\nthe time, I could not catch the expression. These woe-begone figures of\ncaptives are emblematic of Nelson\u2019s principal victories; but I never\ncould look at their swarthy limbs and manacles, without being\ninvoluntarily reminded of four African slaves in the market-place.\nAnd my thoughts would revert to Virginia and Carolina; and also to the\nhistorical fact, that the African slave-trade once constituted the\nprincipal commerce of Liverpool; and that the prosperity of the town\nwas once supposed to have been indissolubly linked to its prosecution.\nAnd I remembered that my father had often spoken to gentlemen visiting\nour house in New York, of the unhappiness that the discussion of the\nabolition of this trade had occasioned in Liverpool; that the struggle\nbetween sordid interest and humanity had made sad havoc at the\nfire-sides of the merchants; estranged sons from sires; and even\nseparated husband from wife. And my thoughts reverted to my father\u2019s\nfriend, the good and great Roscoe, the intrepid enemy of the trade; who\nin every way exerted his fine talents toward its suppression; writing a\npoem _(\u201cthe Wrongs of Africa\u201d),_ several pamphlets; and in his place in\nParliament, he delivered a speech against it, which, as coming from a\nmember for Liverpool, was supposed to have turned many votes, and had\nno small share in the triumph of sound policy and humanity that ensued.\nHow this group of statuary affected me, may be inferred from the fact,\nthat I never went through Chapel-street without going through the\nlittle arch to look at it again. And there, night or day, I was sure to\nfind Lord Nelson still falling back; Victory\u2019s wreath still hovering\nover his swordpoint; and Death grim and grasping as ever; while the\nfour bronze captives still lamented their captivity.\nNow, as I lingered about the railing of the statuary, on the Sunday I\nhave mentioned, I noticed several persons going in and out of an\napartment, opening from the basement under the colonnade; and,\nadvancing, I perceived that this was a news-room, full of files of\npapers. My love of literature prompted me to open the door and step in;\nbut a glance at my soiled shooting-jacket prompted a dignified looking\npersonage to step up and shut the door in my face. I deliberated a\nminute what I should do to him; and at last resolutely determined to\nlet him alone, and pass on; which I did; going down Castle-street (so\ncalled from a castle which once stood there, said my guide-book), and\nturning down into Lord.\nArrived at the foot of the latter street, I in vain looked round for\nthe hotel. How serious a disappointment was this may well be imagined,\nwhen it is considered that I was all eagerness to behold the very house\nat which my father stopped; where he slept and dined, smoked his cigar,\nopened his letters, and read the papers. I inquired of some gentlemen\nand ladies where the missing hotel was; but they only stared and passed\non; until I met a mechanic, apparently, who very civilly stopped to\nhear my questions and give me an answer.\n\u201cRiddough\u2019s Hotel?\u201d said he, \u201cupon my word, I think I have heard of\nsuch a place; let me see\u2014yes, yes\u2014that was the hotel where my father\nbroke his arm, helping to pull down the walls. My lad, you surely can\u2019t\nbe inquiring for Riddough\u2019s Hotel! What do you want to find there?\u201d\n\u201cOh! nothing,\u201d I replied, \u201cI am much obliged for your information\u201d\u2014and\naway I walked.\nThen, indeed, a new light broke in upon me concerning my guide-book;\nand all my previous dim suspicions were almost confirmed. It was nearly\nhalf a century behind the age! and no more fit to guide me about the\ntown, than the map of Pompeii.\nIt was a sad, a solemn, and a most melancholy thought. The book on\nwhich I had so much relied; the book in the old morocco cover; the book\nwith the cocked-hat corners; the book full of fine old family\nassociations; the book with seventeen plates, executed in the highest\nstyle of art; this precious book was next to useless. Yes, the thing\nthat had guided the father, could not guide the son. And I sat down on\na shop step, and gave loose to meditation.\nHere, now, oh, Wellingborough, thought I, learn a lesson, and never\nforget it. This world, my boy, is a moving world; its Riddough\u2019s Hotels\nare forever being pulled down; it never stands still; and its sands are\nforever shifting. This very harbor of Liverpool is gradually filling\nup, they say; and who knows what your son (if you ever have one) may\nbehold, when he comes to visit Liverpool, as long after you as you come\nafter his grandfather. And, Wellingborough, as your father\u2019s guidebook\nis no guide for you, neither would yours (could you afford to buy a\nmodern one to-day) be a true guide to those who come after you.\nGuide-books, Wellingborough, are the least reliable books in all\nliterature; and nearly all literature, in one sense, is made up of\nguide-books. Old ones tell us the ways our fathers went, through the\nthoroughfares and courts of old; but how few of those former places can\ntheir posterity trace, amid avenues of modem erections; to how few is\nthe old guide-book now a clew! Every age makes its own guidebooks, and\nthe old ones are used for waste paper. But there is one Holy\nGuide-Book, Wellingborough, that will never lead you astray, if you but\nfollow it aright; and some noble monuments that remain, though the\npyramids crumble.\nBut though I rose from the door-step a sadder and a wiser boy, and\nthough my guide-book had been stripped of its reputation for\ninfallibility, I did not treat with contumely or disdain, those sacred\npages which had once been a beacon to my sire.\nNo.\u2014Poor old guide-book, thought I, tenderly stroking its back, and\nsmoothing the dog-ears with reverence; I will not use you with despite,\nold Morocco! and you will yet prove a trusty conductor through many old\nstreets in the old parts of this town; even if you are at fault, now\nand then, concerning a Riddough\u2019s Hotel, or some other forgotten thing\nof the past. As I fondly glanced over the leaves, like one who loves\nmore than he chides, my eye lighted upon a passage concerning _\u201cThe Old\nDock,\u201d_ which much aroused my curiosity. I determined to see the place\nwithout delay: and walking on, in what I presumed to be the right\ndirection, at last found myself before a spacious and splendid pile of\nsculptured brown stone; and entering the porch, perceived from\nincontrovertible tokens that it must be the Custom-house. After\nadmiring it awhile, I took out my guide-book again; and what was my\namazement at discovering that, according to its authority, I was\nentirely mistaken with regard to this Custom-house; for precisely where\nI stood, _\u201cThe Old Dock\u201d_ must be standing, and reading on concerning\nit, I met with this very apposite passage:\u2014_\u201cThe first idea that\nstrikes the stranger in coming to this dock, is the singularity of so\ngreat a number of ships afloat in the very heart of the town, without\ndiscovering any connection with the sea.\u201d_\nHere, now, was a poser! Old Morocco confessed that there was a good\ndeal of \u201csingularity\u201d about the thing; nor did he pretend to deny that\nit was, without question, amazing, that this fabulous dock should seem\nto have no _connection with the sea!_ However, the same author went on\nto say, that the _\u201castonished stranger must suspend his wonder for\nawhile, and turn to the left.\u201d_ But, right or left, no place answering\nto the description was to be seen.\nThis was too confounding altogether, and not to be easily accounted\nfor, even by making ordinary allowances for the growth and general\nimprovement of the town in the course of years. So, guide-book in hand,\nI accosted a policeman standing by, and begged him to tell me whether\nhe was acquainted with any place in that neighborhood called the _\u201cOld\nDock.\u201d_ The man looked at me wonderingly at first, and then seeing I\nwas apparently sane, and quite civil into the bargain, he whipped his\nwell-polished boot with his rattan, pulled up his silver-laced\ncoat-collar, and initiated me into a knowledge of the following facts.\nIt seems that in this place originally stood the _\u201cpool,\u201d_ from which\nthe town borrows a part of its name, and which originally wound round\nthe greater part of the old settlements; that this pool was made into\nthe \u201cOld Dock,\u201d for the benefit of the shipping; but that, years ago,\nit had been filled up, and furnished the site for the Custom-house\nbefore me.\nI now eyed the spot with a feeling somewhat akin to the Eastern\ntraveler standing on the brink of the Dead Sea. For here the doom of\nGomorrah seemed reversed, and a lake had been converted into\nsubstantial stone and mortar.\nWell, well, Wellingborough, thought I, you had better put the book into\nyour pocket, and carry it home to the Society of Antiquaries; it is\nseveral thousand leagues and odd furlongs behind the march of\nimprovement. Smell its old morocco binding, Wellingborough; does it not\nsmell somewhat mummy-ish? Does it not remind you of Cheops and the\nCatacombs? I tell you it was written before the lost books of Livy, and\nis cousin-german to that irrecoverably departed volume, entitled, _\u201cThe\nWars of the Lord\u201d_ quoted by Moses in the Pentateuch. Put it up,\nWellingborough, put it up, my dear friend; and hereafter follow your\nnose throughout Liverpool; it will stick to you through thick and thin:\nand be your ship\u2019s mainmast and St. George\u2019s spire your landmarks.\nNo!\u2014And again I rubbed its back softly, and gently adjusted a loose\nleaf: No, no, I\u2019ll not give you up yet. Forth, old Morocco! and lead me\nin sight of the venerable Abbey of Birkenhead; and let these eager eyes\nbehold the mansion once occupied by the old earls of Derby!\nFor the book discoursed of both places, and told how the Abbey was on\nthe Cheshire shore, full in view from a point on the Lancashire side,\ncovered over with ivy, and brilliant with moss! And how the house of\nthe noble Derby\u2019s was now a common jail of the town; and how that\ncircumstance was full of suggestions, and pregnant with wisdom!\nBut, alas! I never saw the Abbey; at least none was in sight from the\nwater: and as for the house of the earls, I never saw that.\nAh me, and ten times alas! am I to visit old England in vain? in the\nland of Thomas-a-Becket and stout John of Gaunt, not to catch the least\nglimpse of priory or castle? Is there nothing in all the British empire\nbut these smoky ranges of old shops and warehouses? is Liverpool but a\nbrick-kiln? Why, no buildings here look so ancient as the old\ngable-pointed mansion of my maternal grandfather at home, whose bricks\nwere brought from Holland long before the revolutionary war! Tis a\ndeceit\u2014a gull\u2014a sham\u2014a hoax! This boasted England is no older than the\nState of New York: if it is, show me the proofs\u2014point out the vouchers.\nWhere\u2019s the tower of Julius Caesar? Where\u2019s the Roman wall? Show me\nStonehenge!\nBut, Wellingborough, I remonstrated with myself, you are only in\nLiverpool; the old monuments lie to the north, south, east, and west of\nyou; you are but a sailor-boy, and you can not expect to be a great\ntourist, and visit the antiquities, in that preposterous\nshooting-jacket of yours. Indeed, you can not, my boy.\nTrue, true\u2014that\u2019s it. I am not the traveler my father was. I am only a\ncommon-carrier across the Atlantic.\nAfter a weary day\u2019s walk, I at last arrived at the sign of the\nBaltimore Clipper to supper; and Handsome Mary poured me out a brimmer\nof tea, in which, for the time, I drowned all my melancholy.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\nTHE DOCKS\nFor more than six weeks, the ship Highlander lay in Prince\u2019s Dock; and\nduring that time, besides making observations upon things immediately\naround me, I made sundry excursions to the neighboring docks, for I\nnever tired of admiring them.\nPrevious to this, having only seen the miserable wooden wharves, and\nslip-shod, shambling piers of New York, the sight of these mighty docks\nfilled my young mind with wonder and delight. In New York, to be sure,\nI could not but be struck with the long line of shipping, and tangled\nthicket of masts along the East River; yet, my admiration had been much\nabated by those irregular, unsightly wharves, which, I am sure, are a\nreproach and disgrace to the city that tolerates them.\nWhereas, in Liverpool, I beheld long China walls of masonry; vast piers\nof stone; and a succession of granite-rimmed docks, completely\ninclosed, and many of them communicating, which almost recalled to mind\nthe great American chain of lakes: Ontario, Erie, St. Clair, Huron,\nMichigan, and Superior. The extent and solidity of these structures,\nseemed equal to what I had read of the old Pyramids of Egypt.\nLiverpool may justly claim to have originated the model of the \u201cWet\nDock,\u201d[1] so called, of the present day; and every thing that is\nconnected with its design, construction, regulation, and improvement.\nEven London was induced to copy after Liverpool, and Havre followed her\nexample. In magnitude, cost, and durability, the docks of Liverpool,\neven at the present day surpass all others in the world.\n[1] This term\u2014_Wet Dock_\u2014did not originate, (as has been erroneously\nopined by the otherwise learned Bardoldi); from the fact, that persons\nfalling into one, never escaped without a soaking; but it is simply\nused, in order to distinguish these docks from the _Dry-Dock_, where\nthe bottoms of ships are repaired.\nThe first dock built by the town was the _\u201cOld Dock,\u201d_ alluded to in my\nSunday stroll with my guide-book. This was erected in 1710, since which\nperiod has gradually arisen that long line of dock-masonry, now\nflanking the Liverpool side of the Mersey.\nFor miles you may walk along that river-side, passing dock after dock,\nlike a chain of immense fortresses:\u2014Prince\u2019s, George\u2019s, Salt-House,\nClarence, Brunswick, Trafalgar, King\u2019s, Queen\u2019s, and many more.\nIn a spirit of patriotic gratitude to those naval heroes, who by their\nvalor did so much to protect the commerce of Britain, in which\nLiverpool held so large a stake; the town, long since, bestowed upon\nits more modern streets, certain illustrious names, that Broadway might\nbe proud of:\u2014Duncan, Nelson, Rodney, St. Vincent, Nile.\nBut it is a pity, I think, that they had not bestowed these noble names\nupon their noble docks; so that they might have been as a rank and file\nof most fit monuments to perpetuate the names of the heroes, in\nconnection with the commerce they defended.\nAnd how much better would such stirring monuments be; full of life and\ncommotion; than hermit obelisks of Luxor, and idle towers of stone;\nwhich, useless to the world in themselves, vainly hope to eternize a\nname, by having it carved, solitary and alone, in their granite. Such\nmonuments are cenotaphs indeed; founded far away from the true body of\nthe fame of the hero; who, if he be truly a hero, must still be linked\nwith the living interests of his race; for the true fame is something\nfree, easy, social, and companionable. They are but tomb-stones, that\ncommemorate his death, but celebrate not his life. It is well enough\nthat over the inglorious and thrice miserable grave of a Dives, some\nvast marble column should be reared, recording the fact of his having\nlived and died; for such records are indispensable to preserve his\nshrunken memory among men; though that memory must soon crumble away\nwith the marble, and mix with the stagnant oblivion of the mob. But to\nbuild such a pompous vanity over the remains of a hero, is a slur upon\nhis fame, and an insult to his ghost. And more enduring monuments are\nbuilt in the closet with the letters of the alphabet, than even Cheops\nhimself could have founded, with all Egypt and Nubia for his quarry.\nAmong the few docks mentioned above, occur the names of the _King\u2019s_\nand _Queens._ At the time, they often reminded me of the two principal\nstreets in the village I came from in America, which streets once\nrejoiced in the same royal appellations. But they had been christened\nprevious to the Declaration of Independence; and some years after, in a\nfever of freedom, they were abolished, at an enthusiastic town-meeting,\nwhere King George and his lady were solemnly declared unworthy of being\nimmortalized by the village of L\u2014. A country antiquary once told me,\nthat a committee of two barbers were deputed to write and inform the\ndistracted old gentleman of the fact.\nAs the description of any one of these Liverpool docks will pretty much\nanswer for all, I will here endeavor to give some account of Prince\u2019s\nDock, where the Highlander rested after her passage across the\nAtlantic.\nThis dock, of comparatively recent construction, is perhaps the largest\nof all, and is well known to American sailors, from the fact, that it\nis mostly frequented by the American shipping. Here lie the noble New\nYork packets, which at home are found at the foot of Wall-street; and\nhere lie the Mobile and Savannah cotton ships and traders.\nThis dock was built like the others, mostly upon the bed of the river,\nthe earth and rock having been laboriously scooped out, and solidified\nagain as materials for the quays and piers. From the river, Prince\u2019s\nDock is protected by a long pier of masonry, surmounted by a massive\nwall; and on the side next the town, it is bounded by similar walls,\none of which runs along a thoroughfare. The whole space thus inclosed\nforms an oblong, and may, at a guess, be presumed to comprise about\nfifteen or twenty acres; but as I had not the rod of a surveyor when I\ntook it in, I will not be certain.\nThe area of the dock itself, exclusive of the inclosed quays\nsurrounding it, may be estimated at, say, ten acres. Access to the\ninterior from the streets is had through several gateways; so that,\nupon their being closed, the whole dock is shut up like a house. From\nthe river, the entrance is through a water-gate, and ingress to ships\nis only to be had, when the level of the dock coincides with that of\nthe river; that is, about the time of high tide, as the level of the\ndock is always at that mark. So that when it is low tide in the river,\nthe keels of the ships inclosed by the quays are elevated more than\ntwenty feet above those of the vessels in the stream. This, of course,\nproduces a striking effect to a stranger, to see hundreds of immense\nships floating high aloft in the heart of a mass of masonry.\nPrince\u2019s Dock is generally so filled with shipping, that the entrance\nof a new-comer is apt to occasion a universal stir among all the older\noccupants. The dock-masters, whose authority is declared by tin signs\nworn conspicuously over their hats, mount the poops and forecastles of\nthe various vessels, and hail the surrounding strangers in all\ndirections:\u2014 _\u201cHighlander ahoy! Cast off your bowline, and sheer\nalongside the Neptune!\u201d\u2014\u201cNeptune ahoy! get out a stern-line, and sheer\nalongside the Trident!\u201d\u2014\u201cTrident ahoy! get out a bowline, and drop\nastern of the Undaunted!\u201d_ And so it runs round like a shock of\nelectricity; touch one, and you touch all. This kind of work irritates\nand exasperates the sailors to the last degree; but it is only one of\nthe unavoidable inconveniences of inclosed docks, which are outweighed\nby innumerable advantages.\nJust without the water-gate, is a basin, always connecting with the\nopen river, through a narrow entrance between pierheads. This basin\nforms a sort of ante-chamber to the dock itself, where vessels lie\nwaiting their turn to enter. During a storm, the necessity of this\nbasin is obvious; for it would be impossible to _\u201cdock\u201d_ a ship under\nfull headway from a voyage across the ocean. From the turbulent waves,\nshe first glides into the ante-chamber between the pier-heads and from\nthence into the docks.\nConcerning the cost of the docks, I can only state, that the _King\u2019s\nDock,_ comprehending but a comparatively small area, was completed at\nan expense of some \u00a320,000.\nOur old ship-keeper, a Liverpool man by birth, who had long followed\nthe seas, related a curious story concerning this dock. One of the\nships which carried over troops from England to Ireland in King\nWilliam\u2019s war, in 1688, entered the King\u2019s Dock on the first day of its\nbeing opened in 1788, after an interval of just one century. She was a\ndark little brig, called the _Port-a-Ferry._ And probably, as her\ntimbers must have been frequently renewed in the course of a hundred\nyears, the name alone could have been all that was left of her at the\ntime. A paved area, very wide, is included within the walls; and along\nthe edge of the quays are ranges of iron sheds, intended as a temporary\nshelter for the goods unladed from the shipping. Nothing can exceed the\nbustle and activity displayed along these quays during the day; bales,\ncrates, boxes, and cases are being tumbled about by thousands of\nlaborers; trucks are coming and going; dock-masters are shouting;\nsailors of all nations are singing out at their ropes; and all this\ncommotion is greatly increased by the resoundings from the lofty walls\nthat hem in the din.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\nTHE SALT-DROGHERS, AND GERMAN EMIGRANT SHIPS\nSurrounded by its broad belt of masonry, each Liverpool dock is a\nwalled town, full of life and commotion; or rather, it is a small\narchipelago, an epitome of the world, where all the nations of\nChristendom, and even those of Heathendom, are represented. For, in\nitself, each ship is an island, a floating colony of the tribe to which\nit belongs.\nHere are brought together the remotest limits of the earth; and in the\ncollective spars and timbers of these ships, all the forests of the\nglobe are represented, as in a grand parliament of masts. Canada and\nNew Zealand send their pines; America her live oak; India her teak;\nNorway her spruce; and the Right Honorable Mahogany, member for\nHonduras and Campeachy, is seen at his post by the wheel. Here, under\nthe beneficent sway of the Genius of Commerce, all climes and countries\nembrace; and yard-arm touches yard-arm in brotherly love.\nA Liverpool dock is a grand caravansary inn, and hotel, on the spacious\nand liberal plan of the _Astor House._ Here ships are lodged at a\nmoderate charge, and payment is not demanded till the time of\ndeparture. Here they are comfortably housed and provided for; sheltered\nfrom all weathers and secured from all calamities. For I can hardly\ncredit a story I have heard, that sometimes, in heavy gales, ships\nlying in the very middle of the docks have lost their\ntop-gallant-masts. Whatever the toils and hardships encountered on the\nvoyage, whether they come from Iceland or the coast of New Guinea, here\ntheir sufferings are ended, and they take their ease in their watery\ninn.\nI know not how many hours I spent in gazing at the shipping in Prince\u2019s\nDock, and speculating concerning their past voyages and future\nprospects in life. Some had just arrived from the most distant ports,\nworn, battered, and disabled; others were all a-taunt-o\u2014spruce, gay,\nand brilliant, in readiness for sea.\nEvery day the Highlander had some new neighbor. A black brig from\nGlasgow, with its crew of sober Scotch caps, and its staid,\nthrifty-looking skipper, would be replaced by a jovial French\nhermaphrodite, its forecastle echoing with songs, and its quarter-deck\nelastic from much dancing.\nOn the other side, perhaps, a magnificent New York Liner, huge as a\nseventy-four, and suggesting the idea of a Mivart\u2019s or Delmonico\u2019s\nafloat, would give way to a Sidney emigrant ship, receiving on board\nits live freight of shepherds from the Grampians, ere long to be\ntending their flocks on the hills and downs of New Holland.\nI was particularly pleased and tickled, with a multitude of little\nsalt-droghers, rigged like sloops, and not much bigger than a\npilot-boat, but with broad bows painted black, and carrying red sails,\nwhich looked as if they had been pickled and stained in a tan-yard.\nThese little fellows were continually coming in with their cargoes for\nships bound to America; and lying, five or six together, alongside of\nthose lofty Yankee hulls, resembled a parcel of red ants about the\ncarcass of a black buffalo.\nWhen loaded, these comical little craft are about level with the water;\nand frequently, when blowing fresh in the river, I have seen them\nflying through the foam with nothing visible but the mast and sail, and\na man at the tiller; their entire cargo being snugly secured under\nhatches.\nIt was diverting to observe the self-importance of the skipper of any\nof these diminutive vessels. He would give himself all the airs of an\nadmiral on a three-decker\u2019s poop; and no doubt, thought quite as much\nof himself. And why not? What could Caesar want more? Though his craft\nwas none of the largest, it was subject to _him;_ and though his crew\nmight only consist of himself; yet if he governed it well, he achieved\na triumph, which the moralists of all ages have set above the victories\nof Alexander.\nThese craft have each a little cabin, the prettiest, charmingest, most\ndelightful little dog-hole in the world; not much bigger than an\nold-fashioned alcove for a bed. It is lighted by little round glasses\nplaced in the deck; so that to the insider, the ceiling is like a small\nfirmament twinkling with astral radiations. For tall men, nevertheless,\nthe place is but ill-adapted; a sitting, or recumbent position being\nindispensable to an occupancy of the premises. Yet small, low, and\nnarrow as the cabin is, somehow, it affords accommodations to the\nskipper and his family. Often, I used to watch the tidy good-wife,\nseated at the open little scuttle, like a woman at a cottage door,\nengaged in knitting socks for her husband; or perhaps, cutting his\nhair, as he kneeled before her. And once, while marveling how a couple\nlike this found room to turn in, below, I was amazed by a noisy\nirruption of cherry-cheeked young tars from the scuttle, whence they\ncame rolling forth, like so many curly spaniels from a kennel.\nUpon one occasion, I had the curiosity to go on board a salt-drogher,\nand fall into conversation with its skipper, a bachelor, who kept house\nall alone. I found him a very sociable, comfortable old fellow, who had\nan eye to having things cozy around him. It was in the evening; and he\ninvited me down into his sanctum to supper; and there we sat together\nlike a couple in a box at an oyster-cellar.\n\u201cHe, he,\u201d he chuckled, kneeling down before a fat, moist, little cask\nof beer, and holding a cocked-hat pitcher to the faucet\u2014\u201cYou see, Jack,\nI keep every thing down here; and nice times I have by myself. Just\nbefore going to bed, it ain\u2019t bad to take a nightcap, you know; eh!\nJack?\u2014here now, smack your lips over that, my boy\u2014have a pipe?\u2014but\nstop, let\u2019s to supper first.\u201d\nSo he went to a little locker, a fixture against the side, and groping\nin it awhile, and addressing it with\u2014_\u201cWhat cheer here, what cheer?\u201d_\nat last produced a loaf, a small cheese, a bit of ham, and a jar of\nbutter. And then placing a board on his lap, spread the table, the\npitcher of beer in the center. \u201cWhy that\u2019s but a two legged table,\u201d\nsaid I, \u201clet\u2019s make it four.\u201d\nSo we divided the burthen, and supped merrily together on our knees.\nHe was an old ruby of a fellow, his cheeks toasted brown; and it did my\nsoul good, to see the froth of the beer bubbling at his mouth, and\nsparkling on his nut-brown beard. He looked so like a great mug of ale,\nthat I almost felt like taking him by the neck and pouring him out.\n\u201cNow Jack,\u201d said he, when supper was over, \u201cnow Jack, my boy, do you\nsmoke?\u2014Well then, load away.\u201d And he handed me a seal-skin pouch of\ntobacco and a pipe. We sat smoking together in this little sea-cabinet\nof his, till it began to look much like a state-room in Tophet; and\nnotwithstanding my host\u2019s rubicund nose, I could hardly see him for the\nfog.\n\u201cHe, he, my boy,\u201d then said he\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t never have any bugs here, I\ntell ye: I smokes \u2019em all out every night before going to bed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where may you sleep?\u201d said I, looking round, and seeing no sign of\na bed.\n\u201cSleep?\u201d says he, \u201cwhy I sleep in my jacket, that\u2019s the best\ncounterpane; and I use my head for a pillow. He-he, funny, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d says I.\n\u201cHave some more ale?\u201d says he; \u201cplenty more.\u201d \u201cNo more, thank you,\u201d\nsays I; \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go;\u201d for what with the tobacco-smoke and the ale,\nI began to feel like breathing fresh air. Besides, my conscience smote\nme for thus freely indulging in the pleasures of the table.\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t go,\u201d said he; \u201cdon\u2019t go, my boy; don\u2019t go out into the\ndamp; take an old Christian\u2019s advice,\u201d laying his hand on my shoulder;\n\u201cit won\u2019t do. You see, by going out now, you\u2019ll shake off the ale, and\nget broad awake again; but if you stay here, you\u2019ll soon be dropping\noff for a nice little nap.\u201d\nBut notwithstanding these inducements, I shook my host\u2019s hand and\ndeparted. There was hardly any thing I witnessed in the docks that\ninterested me more than the German emigrants who come on board the\nlarge New York ships several days before their sailing, to make every\nthing comfortable ere starting. Old men, tottering with age, and little\ninfants in arms; laughing girls in bright-buttoned bodices, and astute,\nmiddle-aged men with pictured pipes in their mouths, would be seen\nmingling together in crowds of five, six, and seven or eight hundred in\none ship.\nEvery evening these countrymen of Luther and Melancthon gathered on the\nforecastle to sing and pray. And it was exalting to listen to their\nfine ringing anthems, reverberating among the crowded shipping, and\nrebounding from the lofty walls of the docks. Shut your eyes, and you\nwould think you were in a cathedral.\nThey keep up this custom at sea; and every night, in the dog-watch,\nsing the songs of Zion to the roll of the great ocean-organ: a pious\ncustom of a devout race, who thus send over their hallelujahs before\nthem, as they hie to the land of the stranger.\nAnd among these sober Germans, my country counts the most orderly and\nvaluable of her foreign population. It is they who have swelled the\ncensus of her Northwestern States; and transferring their ploughs from\nthe hills of Transylvania to the prairies of Wisconsin; and sowing the\nwheat of the Rhine on the banks of the Ohio, raise the grain, that, a\nhundred fold increased, may return to their kinsmen in Europe.\nThere is something in the contemplation of the mode in which America\nhas been settled, that, in a noble breast, should forever extinguish\nthe prejudices of national dislikes. Settled by the people of all\nnations, all nations may claim her for their own. You can not spill a\ndrop of American blood without spilling the blood of the whole world.\nBe he Englishman, Frenchman, German, Dane, or Scot; the European who\nscoffs at an American, calls his own brother _Raca,_ and stands in\ndanger of the judgment. We are not a narrow tribe of men, with a\nbigoted Hebrew nationality\u2014whose blood has been debased in the attempt\nto ennoble it, by maintaining an exclusive succession among ourselves.\nNo: our blood is as the flood of the Amazon, made up of a thousand\nnoble currents all pouring into one. We are not a nation, so much as a\nworld; for unless we may claim all the world for our sire, like\nMelchisedec, we are without father or mother.\nFor who was our father and our mother? Or can we point to any Romulus\nand Remus for our founders? Our ancestry is lost in the universal\npaternity; and Caesar and Alfred, St. Paul and Luther, and Homer and\nShakespeare are as much ours as Washington, who is as much the world\u2019s\nas our own. We are the heirs of all time, and with all nations we\ndivide our inheritance. On this Western Hemisphere all tribes and\npeople are forming into one federated whole; and there is a future\nwhich shall see the estranged children of Adam restored as to the old\nhearthstone in Eden.\nThe other world beyond this, which was longed for by the devout before\nColumbus\u2019 time, was found in the New; and the deep-sea-lead, that first\nstruck these soundings, brought up the soil of Earth\u2019s Paradise. Not a\nParadise then, or now; but to be made so, at God\u2019s good pleasure, and\nin the fullness and mellowness of time. The seed is sown, and the\nharvest must come; and our children\u2019s children, on the world\u2019s jubilee\nmorning, shall all go with their sickles to the reaping. Then shall the\ncurse of Babel be revoked, a new Pentecost come, and the language they\nshall speak shall be the language of Britain. Frenchmen, and Danes, and\nScots; and the dwellers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the\nregions round about; Italians, and Indians, and Moors; there shall\nappear unto them cloven tongues as of fire.\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\nTHE IRRAWADDY\nAmong the various ships lying in Prince\u2019s Dock, none interested me more\nthan the Irrawaddy, of Bombay, a _\u201ccountry ship,\u201d_ which is the name\nbestowed by Europeans upon the large native vessels of India. Forty\nyears ago, these merchantmen were nearly the largest in the world; and\nthey still exceed the generality. They are built of the celebrated teak\nwood, the oak of the East, or in Eastern phrase, _\u201cthe King of the\nOaks.\u201d_ The Irrawaddy had just arrived from Hindostan, with a cargo of\ncotton. She was manned by forty or fifty Lascars, the native seamen of\nIndia, who seemed to be immediately governed by a countryman of theirs\nof a higher caste. While his inferiors went about in strips of white\nlinen, this dignitary was arrayed in a red army-coat, brilliant with\ngold lace, a cocked hat, and drawn sword. But the general effect was\nquite spoiled by his bare feet.\nIn discharging the cargo, his business seemed to consist in\nflagellating the crew with the flat of his saber, an exercise in which\nlong practice had made him exceedingly expert. The poor fellows jumped\naway with the tackle-rope, elastic as cats.\nOne Sunday, I went aboard of the Irrawaddy, when this oriental usher\naccosted me at the gangway, with his sword at my throat. I gently\npushed it aside, making a sign expressive of the pacific character of\nmy motives in paying a visit to the ship. Whereupon he very\nconsiderately let me pass.\nI thought I was in Pegu, so strangely woody was the smell of the\ndark-colored timbers, whose odor was heightened by the rigging of\n_kayar,_ or cocoa-nut fiber.\nThe Lascars were on the forecastle-deck. Among them were Malays,\nMahrattas, Burmese, Siamese, and Cingalese. They were seated round\n\u201ckids\u201d full of rice, from which, according to their invariable custom,\nthey helped themselves with one hand, the other being reserved for\nquite another purpose. They were chattering like magpies in\nHindostanee, but I found that several of them could also speak very\ngood English. They were a small-limbed, wiry, tawny set; and I was\ninformed made excellent seamen, though ill adapted to stand the\nhardships of northern voyaging.\nThey told me that seven of their number had died on the passage from\nBombay; two or three after crossing the Tropic of Cancer, and the rest\nmet their fate in the Channel, where the ship had been tost about in\nviolent seas, attended with cold rains, peculiar to that vicinity. Two\nmore had been lost overboard from the flying-jib-boom.\nI was condoling with a young English cabin-boy on board, upon the loss\nof these poor fellows, when he said it was their own fault; they would\nnever wear monkey-jackets, but clung to their thin India robes, even in\nthe bitterest weather. He talked about them much as a farmer would\nabout the loss of so many sheep by the murrain.\nThe captain of the vessel was an Englishman, as were also the three\nmates, master and boatswain. These officers lived astern in the cabin,\nwhere every Sunday they read the Church of England\u2019s prayers, while the\nheathen at the other end of the ship were left to their false gods and\nidols. And thus, with Christianity on the quarter-deck, and paganism on\nthe forecastle, the Irrawaddy ploughed the sea.\nAs if to symbolize this state of things, the _\u201cfancy piece\u201d_ astern\ncomprised, among numerous other carved decorations, a cross and a\nmiter; while forward, on the bows, was a sort of devil for a\nfigure-head\u2014a dragon-shaped creature, with a fiery red mouth, and a\nswitchy-looking tail.\nAfter her cargo was discharged, which was done \u201cto the sound of flutes\nand soft recorders\u201d\u2014something as work is done in the navy to the music\nof the boatswain\u2019s pipe\u2014the Lascars were set to _\u201cstripping the ship\u201d_\nthat is, to sending down all her spars and ropes.\nAt this time, she lay alongside of us, and the Babel on board almost\ndrowned our own voices. In nothing but their girdles, the Lascars\nhopped about aloft, chattering like so many monkeys; but, nevertheless,\nshowing much dexterity and seamanship in their manner of doing their\nwork.\nEvery Sunday, crowds of well-dressed people came down to the dock to\nsee this singular ship; many of them perched themselves in the shrouds\nof the neighboring craft, much to the wrath of Captain Riga, who left\nstrict orders with our old ship-keeper, to drive all strangers out of\nthe Highlander\u2019s rigging. It was amusing at these times, to watch the\nold women with umbrellas, who stood on the quay staring at the Lascars,\neven when they desired to be private. These inquisitive old ladies\nseemed to regard the strange sailors as a species of wild animal, whom\nthey might gaze at with as much impunity, as at leopards in the\nZoological Gardens.\nOne night I was returning to the ship, when just as I was passing\nthrough the Dock Gate, I noticed a white figure squatting against the\nwall outside. It proved to be one of the Lascars who was smoking, as\nthe regulations of the docks prohibit his indulging this luxury on\nboard his vessel. Struck with the curious fashion of his pipe, and the\nodor from it, I inquired what he was smoking; he replied _\u201cJoggerry,\u201d_\nwhich is a species of weed, used in place of tobacco.\nFinding that he spoke good English, and was quite communicative, like\nmost smokers, I sat down by _Dattabdool-mans, as_ he called himself,\nand we fell into conversation. So instructive was his discourse, that\nwhen we parted, I had considerably added to my stock of knowledge.\nIndeed, it is a Godsend to fall in with a fellow like this. He knows\nthings you never dreamed of; his experiences are like a man from the\nmoon\u2014wholly strange, a new revelation. If you want to learn romance, or\ngain an insight into things quaint, curious, and marvelous, drop your\nbooks of travel, and take a stroll along the docks of a great\ncommercial port. Ten to one, you will encounter Crusoe himself among\nthe crowds of mariners from all parts of the globe.\nBut this is no place for making mention of all the subjects upon which\nI and my Lascar friend mostly discoursed; I will only try to give his\naccount of the _teakwood_ and _kayar rope,_ concerning which things I\nwas curious, and sought information.\nThe _\u201csagoon\u201d_ as he called the tree which produces the teak, grows in\nits greatest excellence among the mountains of Malabar, whence large\nquantities are sent to Bombay for shipbuilding. He also spoke of\nanother kind of wood, the _\u201csissor,\u201d_ which supplies most of the\n_\u201cshin-logs,\u201d_ or \u201cknees,\u201d and crooked timbers in the _country ships._\nThe sagoon grows to an immense size; sometimes there is fifty feet of\ntrunk, three feet through, before a single bough is put forth. Its\nleaves are very large; and to convey some idea of them, my Lascar\nlikened them to elephants\u2019 ears. He said a purple dye was extracted\nfrom them, for the purpose of staining cottons and silks. The wood is\nspecifically heavier than water; it is easily worked, and extremely\nstrong and durable. But its chief merit lies in resisting the action of\nthe salt water, and the attacks of insects; which resistance is caused\nby its containing a resinous oil called _\u201cpoonja.\u201d_\nTo my surprise, he informed me that the Irrawaddy was wholly built by\nthe native shipwrights of India, who, he modestly asserted, surpassed\nthe European artisans.\nThe rigging, also, was of native manufacture. As the _kayar,_ of which\nit is composed, is now getting into use both in England and America, as\nwell for ropes and rigging as for mats and rugs, my Lascar friend\u2019s\naccount of it, joined to my own observations, may not be uninteresting.\nIn India, it is prepared very much in the same way as in Polynesia. The\ncocoa-nut is gathered while the husk is still green, and but partially\nripe; and this husk is removed by striking the nut forcibly, with both\nhands, upon a sharp-pointed stake, planted uprightly in the ground. In\nthis way a boy will strip nearly fifteen hundred in a day. But the\n_kayar_ is not made from the husk, as might be supposed, but from the\nrind of the nut; which, after being long soaked in water, is beaten\nwith mallets, and rubbed together into fibers. After this being dried\nin the sun, you may spin it, just like hemp, or any similar substance.\nThe fiber thus produced makes very strong and durable ropes, extremely\nwell adapted, from their lightness and durability, for the running\nrigging of a ship; while the same causes, united with its great\nstrength and buoyancy, render it very suitable for large cables and\nhawsers.\nBut the elasticity of the _kayar_ ill fits it for the shrouds and\nstanding-rigging of a ship, which require to be comparatively firm.\nHence, as the Irrawaddy\u2019s shrouds were all of this substance, the\nLascar told me, they were continually setting up or slacking off her\nstanding-rigging, according as the weather was cold or warm. And the\nloss of a foretopmast, between the tropics, in a squall, he attributed\nto this circumstance.\nAfter a stay of about two weeks, the Irrawaddy had her heavy Indian\nspars replaced with Canadian pine, and her _kayar_ shrouds with hempen\nones. She then mustered her pagans, and hoisted sail for London.\nCHAPTER XXXV.\nGALLIOTS, COAST-OF-GUINEA-MAN, AND FLOATING CHAPEL\nAnother very curious craft often seen in the Liverpool docks, is the\nDutch galliot, an old-fashioned looking gentleman, with hollow waist,\nhigh prow and stern, and which, seen lying among crowds of tight Yankee\ntraders, and pert French brigantines, always reminded me of a cocked\nhat among modish beavers.\nThe construction of the galliot has not altered for centuries; and the\nnorthern European nations, Danes and Dutch, still sail the salt seas in\nthis flat-bottomed salt-cellar of a ship; although, in addition to\nthese, they have vessels of a more modern kind.\nThey seldom paint the galliot; but scrape and varnish all its planks\nand spars, so that all over it resembles the _\u201cbright side\u201d_ or\npolished _streak,_ usually banding round an American ship.\nSome of them are kept scrupulously neat and clean, and remind one of a\nwell-scrubbed wooden platter, or an old oak table, upon which much wax\nand elbow vigor has been expended. Before the wind, they sail well; but\non a bowline, owing to their broad hulls and flat bottoms, they make\nleeway at a sad rate.\nEvery day, some strange vessel entered Prince\u2019s Dock; and hardly would\nI gaze my fill at some outlandish craft from Surat or the Levant, ere a\nstill more outlandish one would absorb my attention.\nAmong others, I remember, was a little brig from the Coast of Guinea.\nIn appearance, she was the ideal of a slaver; low, black, clipper-built\nabout the bows, and her decks in a state of most piratical disorder.\nShe carried a long, rusty gun, on a swivel, amid-ships; and that gun\nwas a curiosity in itself. It must have been some old veteran,\ncondemned by the government, and sold for any thing it would fetch. It\nwas an antique, covered with half-effaced inscriptions, crowns,\nanchors, eagles; and it had two handles near the trunnions, like those\nof a tureen. The knob on the breach was fashioned into a dolphin\u2019s\nhead; and by a comical conceit, the touch-hole formed the orifice of a\nhuman ear; and a stout tympanum it must have had, to have withstood the\nconcussions it had heard.\nThe brig, heavily loaded, lay between two large ships in ballast; so\nthat its deck was at least twenty feet below those of its neighbors.\nThus shut in, its hatchways looked like the entrance to deep vaults or\nmines; especially as her men were wheeling out of her hold some kind of\nore, which might have been gold ore, so scrupulous were they in evening\nthe bushel measures, in which they transferred it to the quay; and so\nparticular was the captain, a dark-skinned whiskerando, in a Maltese\ncap and tassel, in standing over the sailors, with his pencil and\nmemorandum-book in hand.\nThe crew were a buccaneering looking set; with hairy chests, purple\nshirts, and arms wildly tattooed. The mate had a wooden leg, and\nhobbled about with a crooked cane like a spiral staircase. There was a\ndeal of swearing on board of this craft, which was rendered the more\nreprehensible when she came to moor alongside the Floating Chapel.\nThis was the hull of an old sloop-of-war, which had been converted into\na mariner\u2019s church. A house had been built upon it, and a steeple took\nthe place of a mast. There was a little balcony near the base of the\nsteeple, some twenty feet from the water; where, on week-days, I used\nto see an old pensioner of a tar, sitting on a camp-stool, reading his\nBible. On Sundays he hoisted the Bethel flag, and like the _muezzin_ or\ncryer of prayers on the top of a Turkish mosque, would call the\nstrolling sailors to their devotions; not officially, but on his own\naccount; conjuring them not to make fools of themselves, but muster\nround the pulpit, as they did about the capstan on a man-of-war. This\nold worthy was the sexton. I attended the chapel several times, and\nfound there a very orderly but small congregation. The first time I\nwent, the chaplain was discoursing on future punishments, and making\nallusions to the Tartarean Lake; which, coupled with the pitchy smell\nof the old hull, summoned up the most forcible image of the thing which\nI ever experienced.\nThe floating chapels which are to be found in some of the docks, form\none of the means which have been tried to induce the seamen visiting\nLiverpool to turn their thoughts toward serious things. But as very few\nof them ever think of entering these chapels, though they might pass\nthem twenty times in the day, some of the clergy, of a Sunday, address\nthem in the open air, from the corners of the quays, or wherever they\ncan procure an audience.\nWhenever, in my Sunday strolls, I caught sight of one of these\ncongregations, I always made a point of joining it; and would find\nmyself surrounded by a motley crowd of seamen from all quarters of the\nglobe, and women, and lumpers, and dock laborers of all sorts.\nFrequently the clergyman would be standing upon an old cask, arrayed in\nfull canonicals, as a divine of the Church of England. Never have I\nheard religious discourses better adapted to an audience of men, who,\nlike sailors, are chiefly, if not only, to be moved by the plainest of\nprecepts, and demonstrations of the misery of sin, as conclusive and\nundeniable as those of Euclid. No mere rhetoric avails with such men;\nfine periods are vanity. You can not touch them with tropes. They need\nto be pressed home by plain facts.\nAnd such was generally the mode in which they were addressed by the\nclergy in question: who, taking familiar themes for their discourses,\nwhich were leveled right at the wants of their auditors, always\nsucceeded in fastening their attention. In particular, the two great\nvices to which sailors are most addicted, and which they practice to\nthe ruin of both body and soul; these things, were the most enlarged\nupon. And several times on the docks, I have seen a robed clergyman\naddressing a large audience of women collected from the notorious lanes\nand alleys in the neighborhood.\nIs not this as it ought to be? since the true calling of the reverend\nclergy is like their divine Master\u2019s;\u2014not to bring the righteous, but\nsinners to repentance. Did some of them leave the converted and\ncomfortable congregations, before whom they have ministered year after\nyear; and plunge at once, like St. Paul, into the infected centers and\nhearts of vice: _then_ indeed, would they find a strong enemy to cope\nwith; and a victory gained over _him,_ would entitle them to a\nconqueror\u2019s wreath. Better to save one sinner from an obvious vice that\nis destroying him, than to indoctrinate ten thousand saints. And as\nfrom every corner, in Catholic towns, the shrines of Holy Mary and the\nChild Jesus perpetually remind the commonest wayfarer of his heaven;\neven so should Protestant pulpits be founded in the market-places, and\nat street corners, where the men of God might be heard by all of His\nchildren.\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\nTHE OLD CHURCH OF ST. NICHOLAS, AND THE DEAD-HOUSE\nThe floating chapel recalls to mind the _\u201cOld Church,\u201d_ well known to\nthe seamen of many generations, who have visited Liverpool. It stands\nvery near the docks, a venerable mass of brown stone, and by the town\u2019s\npeople is called the Church of St. Nicholas. I believe it is the best\npreserved piece of antiquity in all Liverpool.\nBefore the town rose to any importance, it was the only place of\nworship on that side of the Mersey; and under the adjoining Parish of\nWalton was a _chapel-of-ease;_ though from the straight backed pews,\nthere could have been but little comfort taken in it.\nIn old times, there stood in front of the church a statue of St.\nNicholas, the patron of mariners; to which all pious sailors made\nofferings, to induce his saintship to grant them short and prosperous\nvoyages. In the tower is a fine chime of bells; and I well remember my\ndelight at first hearing them on the first Sunday morning after our\narrival in the dock. It seemed to carry an admonition with it;\nsomething like the premonition conveyed to young Whittington by Bow\nBells. _\u201cWellingborough! Wellingborough! you must not forget to go to\nchurch, Wellingborough! Don\u2019t forget, Wellingborough! Wellingborough!\ndon\u2019t forget.\u201d_\nThirty or forty years ago, these bells were rung upon the arrival of\nevery Liverpool ship from a foreign voyage. How forcibly does this\nillustrate the increase of the commerce of the town! Were the same\ncustom now observed, the bells would seldom have a chance to cease.\nWhat seemed the most remarkable about this venerable old church, and\nwhat seemed the most barbarous, and grated upon the veneration with\nwhich I regarded this time-hallowed structure, was the condition of the\ngrave-yard surrounding it. From its close vicinity to the haunts of the\nswarms of laborers about the docks, it is crossed and re-crossed by\nthoroughfares in all directions; and the tomb-stones, not being erect,\nbut horizontal (indeed, they form a complete flagging to the spot),\nmultitudes are constantly walking over the dead; their heels erasing\nthe death\u2019s-heads and crossbones, the last mementos of the departed. At\nnoon, when the lumpers employed in loading and unloading the shipping,\nretire for an hour to snatch a dinner, many of them resort to the\ngrave-yard; and seating themselves upon a tomb-stone use the adjoining\none for a table. Often, I saw men stretched out in a drunken sleep upon\nthese slabs; and once, removing a fellow\u2019s arm, read the following\ninscription, which, in a manner, was true to the life, if not to the\ndeath:\u2014\nHERE LYETH YE BODY OF\nTOBIAS DRINKER.\nFor two memorable circumstances connected with this church, I am\nindebted to my excellent friend, Morocco, who tells me that in 1588 the\nEarl of Derby, coming to his residence, and waiting for a passage to\nthe Isle of Man, the corporation erected and adorned a sumptuous stall\nin the church for his reception. And moreover, that in the time of\nCromwell\u2019s wars, when the place was taken by that mad nephew of King\nCharles, Prince Rupert, he converted the old church into a military\nprison and stable; when, no doubt, another _\u201csumptuous stall\u201d_ was\nerected for the benefit of the steed of some noble cavalry officer.\nIn the basement of the church is a Dead House, like the Morgue in\nParis, where the bodies of the drowned are exposed until claimed by\ntheir friends, or till buried at the public charge.\nFrom the multitudes employed about the shipping, this dead-house has\nalways more or less occupants. Whenever I passed up Chapel-street, I\nused to see a crowd gazing through the grim iron grating of the door,\nupon the faces of the drowned within. And once, when the door was\nopened, I saw a sailor stretched out, stark and stiff, with the sleeve\nof his frock rolled up, and showing his name and date of birth tattooed\nupon his arm. It was a sight full of suggestions; he seemed his own\nheadstone.\nI was told that standing rewards are offered for the recovery of\npersons falling into the docks; so much, if restored to life, and a\nless amount if irrecoverably drowned. Lured by this, several horrid old\nmen and women are constantly prying about the docks, searching after\nbodies. I observed them principally early in the morning, when they\nissued from their dens, on the same principle that the rag-rakers, and\nrubbish-pickers in the streets, sally out bright and early; for then,\nthe night-harvest has ripened.\nThere seems to be no calamity overtaking man, that can not be rendered\nmerchantable. Undertakers, sextons, tomb-makers, and hearse-drivers,\nget their living from the dead; and in times of plague most thrive. And\nthese miserable old men and women hunted after corpses to keep from\ngoing to the church-yard themselves; for they were the most wretched of\nstarvelings.\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\nWHAT REDBURN SAW IN LAUNCELOTT\u2019S-HEY\nThe dead-house reminds me of other sad things; for in the vicinity of\nthe docks are many very painful sights.\nIn going to our boarding-house, the sign of the Baltimore Clipper, I\ngenerally passed through a narrow street called \u201cLauncelott\u2019s-Hey,\u201d\nlined with dingy, prison-like cotton warehouses. In this street, or\nrather alley, you seldom see any one but a truck-man, or some solitary\nold warehouse-keeper, haunting his smoky den like a ghost.\nOnce, passing through this place, I heard a feeble wail, which seemed\nto come out of the earth. It was but a strip of crooked side-walk where\nI stood; the dingy wall was on every side, converting the mid-day into\ntwilight; and not a soul was in sight. I started, and could almost have\nrun, when I heard that dismal sound. It seemed the low, hopeless,\nendless wail of some one forever lost. At last I advanced to an opening\nwhich communicated downward with deep tiers of cellars beneath a\ncrumbling old warehouse; and there, some fifteen feet below the walk,\ncrouching in nameless squalor, with her head bowed over, was the figure\nof what had been a woman. Her blue arms folded to her livid bosom two\nshrunken things like children, that leaned toward her, one on each\nside. At first, I knew not whether they were alive or dead. They made\nno sign; they did not move or stir; but from the vault came that\nsoul-sickening wail.\nI made a noise with my foot, which, in the silence, echoed far and\nnear; but there was no response. Louder still; when one of the children\nlifted its head, and cast upward a faint glance; then closed its eyes,\nand lay motionless. The woman also, now gazed up, and perceived me; but\nlet fall her eye again. They were dumb and next to dead with want. How\nthey had crawled into that den, I could not tell; but there they had\ncrawled to die. At that moment I never thought of relieving them; for\ndeath was so stamped in their glazed and unimploring eyes, that I\nalmost regarded them as already no more. I stood looking down on them,\nwhile my whole soul swelled within me; and I asked myself, What right\nhad any body in the wide world to smile and be glad, when sights like\nthis were to be seen? It was enough to turn the heart to gall; and make\na man-hater of a Howard. For who were these ghosts that I saw? Were\nthey not human beings? A woman and two girls? With eyes, and lips, and\nears like any queen? with hearts which, though they did not bound with\nblood, yet beat with a dull, dead ache that was their life.\nAt last, I walked on toward an open lot in the alley, hoping to meet\nthere some ragged old women, whom I had daily noticed groping amid foul\nrubbish for little particles of dirty cotton, which they washed out and\nsold for a trifle.\nI found them; and accosting one, I asked if she knew of the persons I\nhad just left. She replied, that she did not; nor did she want to. I\nthen asked another, a miserable, toothless old woman, with a tattered\nstrip of coarse baling stuff round her body. Looking at me for an\ninstant, she resumed her raking in the rubbish, and said that she knew\nwho it was that I spoke of; but that she had no time to attend to\nbeggars and their brats. Accosting still another, who seemed to know my\nerrand, I asked if there was no place to which the woman could be\ntaken. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied, \u201cto the church-yard.\u201d I said she was alive,\nand not dead.\n\u201cThen she\u2019ll never die,\u201d was the rejoinder. \u201cShe\u2019s been down there\nthese three days, with nothing to eat;\u2014that I know myself.\u201d\n\u201cShe desarves it,\u201d said an old hag, who was just placing on her crooked\nshoulders her bag of pickings, and who was turning to totter off, \u201cthat\nBetsy Jennings desarves it\u2014was she ever married? tell me that.\u201d\nLeaving Launcelott\u2019s-Hey, I turned into a more frequented street; and\nsoon meeting a policeman, told him of the condition of the woman and\nthe girls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business, Jack,\u201d said he. \u201cI don\u2019t belong to that\nstreet.\u201d\n\u201cWho does then?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But what business is it of yours? Are you not a Yankee?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said I, \u201cbut come, I will help you remove that woman, if you say\nso.\u201d\n\u201cThere, now, Jack, go on board your ship and stick to it; and leave\nthese matters to the town.\u201d\nI accosted two more policemen, but with no better success; they would\nnot even go with me to the place. The truth was, it was out of the way,\nin a silent, secluded spot; and the misery of the three outcasts,\nhiding away in the ground, did not obtrude upon any one.\nReturning to them, I again stamped to attract their attention; but this\ntime, none of the three looked up, or even stirred. While I yet stood\nirresolute, a voice called to me from a high, iron-shuttered window in\na loft over the way; and asked what I was about. I beckoned to the man,\na sort of porter, to come down, which he did; when I pointed down into\nthe vault.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat of it?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t we get them out?\u201d said I, \u201chaven\u2019t you some place in your\nwarehouse where you can put them? have you nothing for them to eat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, boy,\u201d said he; \u201cdo you suppose, that Parkins and Wood\nwant their warehouse turned into a hospital?\u201d\nI then went to my boarding-house, and told Handsome Mary of what I had\nseen; asking her if she could not do something to get the woman and\ngirls removed; or if she could not do that, let me have some food for\nthem. But though a kind person in the main, Mary replied that she gave\naway enough to beggars in her own street (which was true enough)\nwithout looking after the whole neighborhood.\nGoing into the kitchen, I accosted the cook, a little shriveled-up old\nWelshwoman, with a saucy tongue, whom the sailors called _Brandy-Nan;_\nand begged her to give me some cold victuals, if she had nothing\nbetter, to take to the vault. But she broke out in a storm of swearing\nat the miserable occupants of the vault, and refused. I then stepped\ninto the room where our dinner was being spread; and waiting till the\ngirl had gone out, I snatched some bread and cheese from a stand, and\nthrusting it into the bosom of my frock, left the house. Hurrying to\nthe lane, I dropped the food down into the vault. One of the girls\ncaught at it convulsively, but fell back, apparently fainting; the\nsister pushed the other\u2019s arm aside, and took the bread in her hand;\nbut with a weak uncertain grasp like an infant\u2019s. She placed it to her\nmouth; but letting it fall again, murmuring faintly something like\n\u201cwater.\u201d The woman did not stir; her head was bowed over, just as I had\nfirst seen her.\nSeeing how it was, I ran down toward the docks to a mean little sailor\ntavern, and begged for a pitcher; but the cross old man who kept it\nrefused, unless I would pay for it. But I had no money. So as my\nboarding-house was some way off, and it would be lost time to run to\nthe ship for my big iron pot; under the impulse of the moment, I\nhurried to one of the Boodle Hydrants, which I remembered having seen\nrunning near the scene of a still smoldering fire in an old rag house;\nand taking off a new tarpaulin hat, which had been loaned me that day,\nfilled it with water.\nWith this, I returned to Launcelott\u2019s-Hey; and with considerable\ndifficulty, like getting down into a well, I contrived to descend with\nit into the vault; where there was hardly space enough left to let me\nstand. The two girls drank out of the hat together; looking up at me\nwith an unalterable, idiotic expression, that almost made me faint. The\nwoman spoke not a word, and did not stir. While the girls were breaking\nand eating the bread, I tried to lift the woman\u2019s head; but, feeble as\nshe was, she seemed bent upon holding it down. Observing her arms still\nclasped upon her bosom, and that something seemed hidden under the rags\nthere, a thought crossed my mind, which impelled me forcibly to\nwithdraw her hands for a moment; when I caught a glimpse of a meager\nlittle babe\u2014the lower part of its body thrust into an old bonnet. Its\nface was dazzlingly white, even in its squalor; but the closed eyes\nlooked like balls of indigo. It must have been dead some hours.\nThe woman refusing to speak, eat, or drink, I asked one of the girls\nwho they were, and where they lived; but she only stared vacantly,\nmuttering something that could not be understood.\nThe air of the place was now getting too much for me; but I stood\ndeliberating a moment, whether it was possible for me to drag them out\nof the vault. But if I did, what then? They would only perish in the\nstreet, and here they were at least protected from the rain; and more\nthan that, might die in seclusion.\nI crawled up into the street, and looking down upon them again, almost\nrepented that I had brought them any food; for it would only tend to\nprolong their misery, without hope of any permanent relief: for die\nthey must very soon; they were too far gone for any medicine to help\nthem. I hardly know whether I ought to confess another thing that\noccurred to me as I stood there; but it was this\u2014I felt an almost\nirresistible impulse to do them the last mercy, of in some way putting\nan end to their horrible lives; and I should almost have done so, I\nthink, had I not been deterred by thoughts of the law. For I well knew\nthat the law, which would let them perish of themselves without giving\nthem one cup of water, would spend a thousand pounds, if necessary, in\nconvicting him who should so much as offer to relieve them from their\nmiserable existence.\nThe next day, and the next, I passed the vault three times, and still\nmet the same sight. The girls leaning up against the woman on each\nside, and the woman with her arms still folding the babe, and her head\nbowed. The first evening I did not see the bread that I had dropped\ndown in the morning; but the second evening, the bread I had dropped\nthat morning remained untouched. On the third morning the smell that\ncame from the vault was such, that I accosted the same policeman I had\naccosted before, who was patrolling the same street, and told him that\nthe persons I had spoken to him about were dead, and he had better have\nthem removed. He looked as if he did not believe me, and added, that it\nwas not his street.\nWhen I arrived at the docks on my way to the ship, I entered the\nguard-house within the walls, and asked for one of the captains, to\nwhom I told the story; but, from what he said, was led to infer that\nthe Dock Police was distinct from that of the town, and this was not\nthe right place to lodge my information.\nI could do no more that morning, being obliged to repair to the ship;\nbut at twelve o\u2019clock, when I went to dinner, I hurried into\nLauncelott\u2019s-Hey, when I found that the vault was empty. In place of\nthe women and children, a heap of quick-lime was glistening.\nI could not learn who had taken them away, or whither they had gone;\nbut my prayer was answered\u2014they were dead, departed, and at peace.\nBut again I looked down into the vault, and in fancy beheld the pale,\nshrunken forms still crouching there. Ah! what are our creeds, and how\ndo we hope to be saved? Tell me, oh Bible, that story of Lazarus again,\nthat I may find comfort in my heart for the poor and forlorn.\nSurrounded as we are by the wants and woes of our fellowmen, and yet\ngiven to follow our own pleasures, regardless of their pains, are we\nnot like people sitting up with a corpse, and making merry in the house\nof the dead?\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\nTHE DOCK-WALL BEGGARS\nI might relate other things which befell me during the six weeks and\nmore that I remained in Liverpool, often visiting the cellars, sinks,\nand hovels of the wretched lanes and courts near the river. But to tell\nof them, would only be to tell over again the story just told; so I\nreturn to the docks.\nThe old women described as picking dirty fragments of cotton in the\nempty lot, belong to the same class of beings who at all hours of the\nday are to be seen within the dock walls, raking over and over the\nheaps of rubbish carried ashore from the holds of the shipping.\nAs it is against the law to throw the least thing overboard, even a\nrope yarn; and as this law is very different from similar laws in New\nYork, inasmuch as it is rigidly enforced by the dock-masters; and,\nmoreover, as after discharging a ship\u2019s cargo, a great deal of dirt and\nworthless dunnage remains in the hold, the amount of rubbish\naccumulated in the appointed receptacles for depositing it within the\nwalls is extremely large, and is constantly receiving new accessions\nfrom every vessel that unlades at the quays.\nStanding over these noisome heaps, you will see scores of tattered\nwretches, armed with old rakes and picking-irons, turning over the\ndirt, and making as much of a rope-yarn as if it were a skein of silk.\nTheir findings, nevertheless, are but small; for as it is one of the\nimmemorial perquisites of the second mate of a merchant ship to\ncollect, and sell on his own account, all the condemned \u201cold junk\u201d of\nthe vessel to which he belongs, he generally takes good heed that in\nthe buckets of rubbish carried ashore, there shall be as few rope-yarns\nas possible.\nIn the same way, the cook preserves all the odds and ends of pork-rinds\nand beef-fat, which he sells at considerable profit; upon a six months\u2019\nvoyage frequently realizing thirty or forty dollars from the sale, and\nin large ships, even more than that. It may easily be imagined, then,\nhow desperately driven to it must these rubbish-pickers be, to ransack\nheaps of refuse which have been previously gleaned.\nNor must I omit to make mention of the singular beggary practiced in\nthe streets frequented by sailors; and particularly to record the\nremarkable army of paupers that beset the docks at particular hours of\nthe day.\nAt twelve o\u2019clock the crews of hundreds and hundreds of ships issue in\ncrowds from the dock gates to go to their dinner in the town. This hour\nis seized upon by multitudes of beggars to plant themselves against the\noutside of the walls, while others stand upon the curbstone to excite\nthe charity of the seamen. The first time that I passed through this\nlong lane of pauperism, it seemed hard to believe that such an array of\nmisery could be furnished by any town in the world.\nEvery variety of want and suffering here met the eye, and every vice\nshowed here its victims. Nor were the marvelous and almost incredible\nshifts and stratagems of the professional beggars, wanting to finish\nthis picture of all that is dishonorable to civilization and humanity.\nOld women, rather mummies, drying up with slow starving and age; young\ngirls, incurably sick, who ought to have been in the hospital; sturdy\nmen, with the gallows in their eyes, and a whining lie in their mouths;\nyoung boys, hollow-eyed and decrepit; and puny mothers, holding up puny\nbabes in the glare of the sun, formed the main features of the scene.\nBut these were diversified by instances of peculiar suffering, vice, or\nart in attracting charity, which, to me at least, who had never seen\nsuch things before, seemed to the last degree uncommon and monstrous.\nI remember one cripple, a young man rather decently clad, who sat\nhuddled up against the wall, holding a painted board on his knees. It\nwas a picture intending to represent the man himself caught in the\nmachinery of some factory, and whirled about among spindles and cogs,\nwith his limbs mangled and bloody. This person said nothing, but sat\nsilently exhibiting his board. Next him, leaning upright against the\nwall, was a tall, pallid man, with a white bandage round his brow, and\nhis face cadaverous as a corpse. He, too, said nothing; but with one\nfinger silently pointed down to the square of flagging at his feet,\nwhich was nicely swept, and stained blue, and bore this inscription in\nchalk:\u2014\n_\u201cI have had no food for three days;\nMy wife and children are dying.\u201d_\nFurther on lay a man with one sleeve of his ragged coat removed,\nshowing an unsightly sore; and above it a label with some writing.\nIn some places, for the distance of many rods, the whole line of\nflagging immediately at the base of the wall, would be completely\ncovered with inscriptions, the beggars standing over them in silence.\nBut as you passed along these horrible records, in an hour\u2019s time\ndestined to be obliterated by the feet of thousands and thousands of\nwayfarers, you were not left unassailed by the clamorous petitions of\nthe more urgent applicants for charity. They beset you on every hand;\ncatching you by the coat; hanging on, and following you along; and,\n_for Heaven\u2019s sake,_ and _for God\u2019s sake,_ and _for Christ\u2019s sake,_\nbeseeching of you but _one ha\u2019penny._ If you so much as glanced your\neye on one of them, even for an instant, it was perceived like\nlightning, and the person never left your side until you turned into\nanother street, or satisfied his demands. Thus, at least, it was with\nthe sailors; though I observed that the beggars treated the town\u2019s\npeople differently.\nI can not say that the seamen did much to relieve the destitution which\nthree times every day was presented to their view. Perhaps habit had\nmade them callous; but the truth might have been that very few of them\nhad much money to give. Yet the beggars must have had some inducement\nto infest the dock walls as they did.\nAs an example of the caprice of sailors, and their sympathy with\nsuffering among members of their own calling, I must mention the case\nof an old man, who every day, and all day long, through sunshine and\nrain, occupied a particular corner, where crowds of tars were always\npassing. He was an uncommonly large, plethoric man, with a wooden leg,\nand dressed in the nautical garb; his face was red and round; he was\ncontinually merry; and with his wooden stump thrust forth, so as almost\nto trip up the careless wayfarer, he sat upon a great pile of monkey\njackets, with a little depression in them between his knees, to receive\nthe coppers thrown him. And plenty of pennies were tost into his\npoor-box by the sailors, who always exchanged a pleasant word with the\nold man, and passed on, generally regardless of the neighboring\nbeggars.\nThe first morning I went ashore with my shipmates, some of them greeted\nhim as an old acquaintance; for that corner he had occupied for many\nlong years. He was an old man-of-war\u2019s man, who had lost his leg at the\nbattle of Trafalgar; and singular to tell, he now exhibited his wooden\none as a genuine specimen of the oak timbers of Nelson\u2019s ship, the\nVictory.\nAmong the paupers were several who wore old sailor hats and jackets,\nand claimed to be destitute tars; and on the strength of these\npretensions demanded help from their brethren; but Jack would see\nthrough their disguise in a moment, and turn away, with no benediction.\nAs I daily passed through this lane of beggars, who thronged the docks\nas the Hebrew cripples did the Pool of Bethesda, and as I thought of my\nutter inability in any way to help them, I could not but offer up a\nprayer, that some angel might descend, and turn the waters of the docks\ninto an elixir, that would heal all their woes, and make them, man and\nwoman, healthy and whole as their ancestors, Adam and Eve, in the\ngarden.\nAdam and Eve! If indeed ye are yet alive and in heaven, may it be no\npart of your immortality to look down upon the world ye have left. For\nas all these sufferers and cripples are as much your family as young\nAbel, so, to you, the sight of the world\u2019s woes would be a parental\ntorment indeed.\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\nTHE BOOBLE-ALLEYS OF THE TOWN\nThe same sights that are to be met with along the dock walls at noon,\nin a less degree, though diversified with other scenes, are continually\nencountered in the narrow streets where the sailor boarding-houses are\nkept.\nIn the evening, especially when the sailors are gathered in great\nnumbers, these streets present a most singular spectacle, the entire\npopulation of the vicinity being seemingly turned into them.\nHand-organs, fiddles, and cymbals, plied by strolling musicians, mix\nwith the songs of the seamen, the babble of women and children, and the\ngroaning and whining of beggars. From the various boarding-houses, each\ndistinguished by gilded emblems outside\u2014an anchor, a crown, a ship, a\nwindlass, or a dolphin\u2014proceeds the noise of revelry and dancing; and\nfrom the open casements lean young girls and old women, chattering and\nlaughing with the crowds in the middle of the street. Every moment\nstrange greetings are exchanged between old sailors who chance to\nstumble upon a shipmate, last seen in Calcutta or Savannah; and the\ninvariable courtesy that takes place upon these occasions, is to go to\nthe next spirit-vault, and drink each other\u2019s health.\nThere are particular paupers who frequent particular sections of these\nstreets, and who, I was told, resented the intrusion of mendicants from\nother parts of the town.\nChief among them was a white-haired old man, stone-blind; who was led\nup and down through the long tumult by a woman holding a little saucer\nto receive contributions. This old man sang, or rather chanted, certain\nwords in a peculiarly long-drawn, guttural manner, throwing back his\nhead, and turning up his sightless eyeballs to the sky. His chant was a\nlamentation upon his infirmity; and at the time it produced the same\neffect upon me, that my first reading of Milton\u2019s Invocation to the Sun\ndid, years afterward. I can not recall it all; but it was something\nlike this, drawn out in an endless groan\u2014\n\u201cHere goes the blind old man; blind, blind, blind; no more will he see\nsun nor moon\u2014no more see sun nor moon!\u201d And thus would he pass through\nthe middle of the street; the woman going on in advance, holding his\nhand, and dragging him through all obstructions; now and then leaving\nhim standing, while she went among the crowd soliciting coppers.\nBut one of the most curious features of the scene is the number of\nsailor ballad-singers, who, after singing their verses, hand you a\nprinted copy, and beg you to buy. One of these persons, dressed like a\nman-of-war\u2019s-man, I observed every day standing at a corner in the\nmiddle of the street. He had a full, noble voice, like a church-organ;\nand his notes rose high above the surrounding din. But the remarkable\nthing about this ballad-singer was one of his arms, which, while\nsinging, he somehow swung vertically round and round in the air, as if\nit revolved on a pivot. The feat was unnaturally unaccountable; and he\nperformed it with the view of attracting sympathy; since he said that\nin falling from a frigate\u2019s mast-head to the deck, he had met with an\ninjury, which had resulted in making his wonderful arm what it was.\nI made the acquaintance of this man, and found him no common character.\nHe was full of marvelous adventures, and abounded in terrific stories\nof pirates and sea murders, and all sorts of nautical enormities. He\nwas a monomaniac upon these subjects; he was a Newgate Calendar of the\nrobberies and assassinations of the day, happening in the sailor\nquarters of the town; and most of his ballads were upon kindred\nsubjects. He composed many of his own verses, and had them printed for\nsale on his own account. To show how expeditious he was at this\nbusiness, it may be mentioned, that one evening on leaving the dock to\ngo to supper, I perceived a crowd gathered about the _Old Fort Tavern;_\nand mingling with the rest, I learned that a woman of the town had just\nbeen killed at the bar by a drunken Spanish sailor from Cadiz. The\nmurderer was carried off by the police before my eyes, and the very\nnext morning the ballad-singer with the miraculous arm, was singing the\ntragedy in front of the boarding-houses, and handing round printed\ncopies of the song, which, of course, were eagerly bought up by the\nseamen.\nThis passing allusion to the murder will convey some idea of the events\nwhich take place in the lowest and most abandoned neighborhoods\nfrequented by sailors in Liverpool. The pestilent lanes and alleys\nwhich, in their vocabulary, go by the names of Rotten-row,\nGibraltar-place, and Booble-alley, are putrid with vice and crime; to\nwhich, perhaps, the round globe does not furnish a parallel. The sooty\nand begrimed bricks of the very houses have a reeking, Sodomlike, and\nmurderous look; and well may the shroud of coal-smoke, which hangs over\nthis part of the town, more than any other, attempt to hide the\nenormities here practiced. These are the haunts from which sailors\nsometimes disappear forever; or issue in the morning, robbed naked,\nfrom the broken doorways. These are the haunts in which cursing,\ngambling, pickpocketing, and common iniquities, are virtues too lofty\nfor the infected gorgons and hydras to practice. Propriety forbids that\nI should enter into details; but kidnappers, burkers, and\nresurrectionists are almost saints and angels to them. They seem\nleagued together, a company of miscreant misanthropes, bent upon doing\nall the malice to mankind in their power. With sulphur and brimstone\nthey ought to be burned out of their arches like vermin.\nCHAPTER XL.\nPLACARDS, BRASS-JEWELERS, TRUCK-HORSES, AND STEAMERS\nAs I wish to group together what fell under my observation concerning\nthe Liverpool docks, and the scenes roundabout, I will try to throw\ninto this chapter various minor things that I recall.\nThe advertisements of pauperism chalked upon the flagging round the\ndock walls, are singularly accompanied by a multitude of quite\ndifferent announcements, placarded upon the walls themselves. They are\nprincipally notices of the approaching departure of _\u201csuperior,\nfast-sailing, coppered and copper-fastened ships,\u201d_ for the United\nStates, Canada, New South Wales, and other places. Interspersed with\nthese, are the advertisements of Jewish clothesmen, informing the\njudicious seamen where he can procure of the best and the cheapest;\ntogether with ambiguous medical announcements of the tribe of quacks\nand empirics who prey upon all seafaring men. Not content with thus\npublicly giving notice of their whereabouts, these indefatigable\nSangrados and pretended Samaritans hire a parcel of shabby\nworkhouse-looking knaves, whose business consists in haunting the dock\nwalls about meal times, and silently thrusting mysterious little\nbillets\u2014duodecimo editions of the larger advertisements\u2014into the\nastonished hands of the tars.\nThey do this, with such a mysterious hang-dog wink; such a sidelong\nair; such a villainous assumption of your necessities; that, at first,\nyou are almost tempted to knock them down for their pains.\nConspicuous among the notices on the walls, are huge Italic inducements\nto all seamen disgusted with the merchant service, to accept a round\nbounty, and embark in her Majesty\u2019s navy.\nIn the British armed marine, in time of peace, they do not ship men for\nthe general service, as in the American navy; but for particular ships,\ngoing upon particular cruises. Thus, the frigate Thetis may be\nannounced as about to sail under the command of that fine old sailor,\nand noble father to his crew, _Lord George Flagstaff._\nSimilar announcements may be seen upon the walls concerning enlistments\nin the army. And never did auctioneer dilate with more rapture upon the\ncharms of some country-seat put up for sale, than the authors of these\nplacards do, upon the beauty and salubrity of the distant climes, for\nwhich the regiments wanting recruits are about to sail. Bright lawns,\nvine-clad hills, endless meadows of verdure, here make up the\nlandscape; and adventurous young gentlemen, fond of travel, are\ninformed, that here is a chance for them to see the world at their\nleisure, and be paid for enjoying themselves into the bargain. The\nregiments for India are promised plantations among valleys of palms;\nwhile to those destined for New Holland, a novel sphere of life and\nactivity is opened; and the companies bound to Canada and Nova Scotia\nare lured by tales of summer suns, that ripen grapes in December. No\nword of war is breathed; hushed is the clang of arms in these\nannouncements; and the sanguine recruit is almost tempted to expect\nthat pruning-hooks, instead of swords, will be the weapons he will\nwield.\nAlas! is not this the cruel stratagem of Bruce at Bannockburn, who\ndecoyed to his war-pits by covering them over with green boughs? For\ninstead of a farm at the blue base of the Himalayas, the Indian recruit\nencounters the keen saber of the Sikh; and instead of basking in sunny\nbowers, the Canadian soldier stands a shivering sentry upon the bleak\nramparts of Quebec, a lofty mark for the bitter blasts from Baffin\u2019s\nBay and Labrador. There, as his eye sweeps down the St. Lawrence, whose\nevery billow is bound for the main that laves the shore of Old England;\nas he thinks of his long term of enlistment, which sells him to the\narmy as Doctor Faust sold himself to the devil; how the poor fellow\nmust groan in his grief, and call to mind the church-yard stile, and\nhis Mary.\nThese army announcements are well fitted to draw recruits in Liverpool.\nAmong the vast number of emigrants, who daily arrive from all parts of\nBritain to embark for the United States or the colonies, there are many\nyoung men, who, upon arriving at Liverpool, find themselves next to\npenniless; or, at least, with only enough money to carry them over the\nsea, without providing for future contingencies. How easily and\nnaturally, then, may such youths be induced to enter upon the military\nlife, which promises them a free passage to the most distant and\nflourishing colonies, and certain pay for doing nothing; besides\nholding out hopes of vineyards and farms, to be verified in the\nfullness of time. For in a moneyless youth, the decision to leave home\nat all, and embark upon a long voyage to reside in a remote clime, is a\npiece of adventurousness only one removed from the spirit that prompts\nthe army recruit to enlist.\nI never passed these advertisements, surrounded by crowds of gaping\nemigrants, without thinking of rattraps.\nBesides the mysterious agents of the quacks, who privily thrust their\nlittle notes into your hands, folded up like a powder; there are\nanother set of rascals prowling about the docks, chiefly at dusk; who\nmake strange motions to you, and beckon you to one side, as if they had\nsome state secret to disclose, intimately connected with the weal of\nthe commonwealth. They nudge you with an elbow full of indefinite hints\nand intimations; they glitter upon you an eye like a Jew\u2019s or a\npawnbroker\u2019s; they dog you like Italian assassins. But if the blue coat\nof a policeman chances to approach, how quickly they strive to look\ncompletely indifferent, as to the surrounding universe; how they\nsaunter off, as if lazily wending their way to an affectionate wife and\nfamily.\nThe first time one of these mysterious personages accosted me, I\nfancied him crazy, and hurried forward to avoid him. But arm in arm\nwith my shadow, he followed after; till amazed at his conduct, I turned\nround and paused.\nHe was a little, shabby, old man, with a forlorn looking coat and hat;\nand his hand was fumbling in his vest pocket, as if to take out a card\nwith his address. Seeing me stand still he made a sign toward a dark\nangle of the wall, near which we were; when taking him for a cunning\nfoot-pad, I again wheeled about, and swiftly passed on. But though I\ndid not look round, I _felt_ him following me still; so once more I\nstopped. The fellow now assumed so mystic and admonitory an air, that I\nbegan to fancy he came to me on some warning errand; that perhaps a\nplot had been laid to blow up the Liverpool docks, and he was some\nMonteagle bent upon accomplishing my flight. I was determined to see\nwhat he was. With all my eyes about me, I followed him into the arch of\na warehouse; when he gazed round furtively, and silently showing me a\nring, whispered, \u201cYou may have it for a shilling; it\u2019s pure gold\u2014I\nfound it in the gutter\u2014hush! don\u2019t speak! give me the money, and it\u2019s\nyours.\u201d\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said I, \u201cI don\u2019t trade in these articles; I don\u2019t want\nyour ring.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you? Then take that,\u201d he whispered, in an intense hushed\npassion; and I fell flat from a blow on the chest, while this infamous\njeweler made away with himself out of sight. This business transaction\nwas conducted with a counting-house promptitude that astonished me.\nAfter that, I shunned these scoundrels like the leprosy: and the next\ntime I was pertinaciously followed, I stopped, and in a loud voice,\npointed out the man to the passers-by; upon which he absconded; rapidly\nturning up into sight a pair of obliquely worn and battered boot-heels.\nI could not help thinking that these sort of fellows, so given to\nrunning away upon emergencies, must furnish a good deal of work to the\nshoemakers; as they might, also, to the growers of hemp and\ngallows-joiners.\nBelonging to a somewhat similar fraternity with these irritable\nmerchants of brass jewelry just mentioned, are the peddlers of\nSheffield razors, mostly boys, who are hourly driven out of the dock\ngates by the police; nevertheless, they contrive to saunter back, and\nboard the vessels, going among the sailors and privately exhibiting\ntheir wares. Incited by the extreme cheapness of one of the razors, and\nthe gilding on the case containing it, a shipmate of mine purchased it\non the spot for a commercial equivalent of the price, in tobacco. On\nthe following Sunday, he used that razor; and the result was a pair of\ntormented and tomahawked cheeks, that almost required a surgeon to\ndress them. In old times, by the way, it was not a bad thought, that\nsuggested the propriety of a barber\u2019s practicing surgery in connection\nwith the chin-harrowing vocation.\nAnother class of knaves, who practice upon the sailors in Liverpool,\nare the pawnbrokers, inhabiting little rookeries among the narrow lanes\nadjoining the dock. I was astonished at the multitude of gilded balls\nin these streets, emblematic of their calling. They were generally next\nneighbors to the gilded grapes over the spirit-vaults; and no doubt,\nmutually to facilitate business operations, some of these\nestablishments have connecting doors inside, so as to play their\ncustomers into each other\u2019s hands. I often saw sailors in a state of\nintoxication rushing from a spirit-vault into a pawnbroker\u2019s; stripping\noff their boots, hats, jackets, and neckerchiefs, and sometimes even\ntheir pantaloons on the spot, and offering to pawn them for a song. Of\ncourse such applications were never refused. But though on shore, at\nLiverpool, poor Jack finds more sharks than at sea, he himself is by no\nmeans exempt from practices, that do not savor of a rigid morality; at\nleast according to law. In tobacco smuggling he is an adept: and when\ncool and collected, often manages to evade the Customs completely, and\nland goodly packages of the weed, which owing to the immense duties\nupon it in England, commands a very high price.\nAs soon as we came to anchor in the river, before reaching the dock,\nthree Custom-house underlings boarded us, and coming down into the\nforecastle, ordered the men to produce all the tobacco they had.\nAccordingly several pounds were brought forth.\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d asked the officers.\n\u201cAll,\u201d said the men.\n\u201cWe will see,\u201d returned the others.\nAnd without more ado, they emptied the chests right and left; tossed\nover the bunks and made a thorough search of the premises; but\ndiscovered nothing. The sailors were then given to understand, that\nwhile the ship lay in dock, the tobacco must remain in the cabin, under\ncustody of the chief mate, who every morning would dole out to them one\nplug per head, as a security against their carrying it ashore.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said the men.\nBut several of them had secret places in the ship, from whence they\ndaily drew pound after pound of tobacco, which they smuggled ashore in\nthe manner following.\nWhen the crew went to meals, each man carried at least one plug in his\npocket; _that_ he had a right to; and as many more were hidden about\nhis person as he dared. Among the great crowds pouring out of the\ndock-gates at such hours, of course these smugglers stood little chance\nof detection; although vigilant looking policemen were always standing\nby. And though these _\u201cCharlies\u201d_ might suppose there were tobacco\nsmugglers passing; yet to hit the right man among such a throng, would\nbe as hard, as to harpoon a speckled porpoise, one of ten thousand\ndarting under a ship\u2019s bows.\nOur forecastle was often visited by foreign sailors, who knowing we\ncame from America, were anxious to purchase tobacco at a cheap rate;\nfor in Liverpool it is about an American penny per pipe-full. Along the\ndocks they sell an English pennyworth, put up in a little roll like\nconfectioners\u2019 mottoes, with poetical lines, or instructive little\nmoral precepts printed in red on the back.\nAmong all the sights of the docks, the noble truck-horses are not the\nleast striking to a stranger. They are large and powerful brutes, with\nsuch sleek and glossy coats, that they look as if brushed and put on by\na valet every morning. They march with a slow and stately step, lifting\ntheir ponderous hoofs like royal Siam elephants. Thou shalt not lay\nstripes upon these Roman citizens; for their docility is such, they are\nguided without rein or lash; they go or come, halt or march on, at a\nwhisper. So grave, dignified, gentlemanly, and courteous did these fine\ntruck-horses look\u2014so full of calm intelligence and sagacity, that often\nI endeavored to get into conversation with them, as they stood in\ncontemplative attitudes while their loads were preparing. But all I\ncould get from them was the mere recognition of a friendly neigh;\nthough I would stake much upon it that, could I have spoken in their\nlanguage, I would have derived from them a good deal of valuable\ninformation touching the docks, where they passed the whole of their\ndignified lives.\nThere are unknown worlds of knowledge in brutes; and whenever you mark\na horse, or a dog, with a peculiarly mild, calm, deep-seated eye, be\nsure he is an Aristotle or a Kant, tranquilly speculating upon the\nmysteries in man. No philosophers so thoroughly comprehend us as dogs\nand horses. They see through us at a glance. And after all, what is a\nhorse but a species of four-footed dumb man, in a leathern overall, who\nhappens to live upon oats, and toils for his masters, half-requited or\nabused, like the biped hewers of wood and drawers of water? But there\nis a touch of divinity even in brutes, and a special halo about a\nhorse, that should forever exempt him from indignities. As for those\nmajestic, magisterial truck-horses of the docks, I would as soon think\nof striking a judge on the bench, as to lay violent hand upon their\nholy hides.\nIt is wonderful what loads their majesties will condescend to draw. The\ntruck is a large square platform, on four low wheels; and upon this the\nlumpers pile bale after bale of cotton, as if they were filling a large\nwarehouse, and yet a procession of three of these horses will\ntranquilly walk away with the whole.\nThe truckmen themselves are almost as singular a race as their animals.\nLike the Judiciary in England, they wear gowns,\u2014not of the same cut and\ncolor though,\u2014which reach below their knees; and from the racket they\nmake on the pavements with their hob-nailed brogans, you would think\nthey patronized the same shoemaker with their horses. I never could get\nany thing out of these truckmen. They are a reserved, sober-sided set,\nwho, with all possible solemnity, march at the head of their animals;\nnow and then gently advising them to sheer to the right or the left, in\norder to avoid some passing vehicle. Then spending so much of their\nlives in the high-bred company of their horses, seems to have mended\ntheir manners and improved their taste, besides imparting to them\nsomething of the dignity of their animals; but it has also given to\nthem a sort of refined and uncomplaining aversion to human society.\nThere are many strange stories told of the truck-horse. Among others is\nthe following: There was a parrot, that from having long been suspended\nin its cage from a low window fronting a dock, had learned to converse\npretty fluently in the language of the stevedores and truckmen. One day\na truckman left his vehicle standing on the quay, with its back to the\nwater. It was noon, when an interval of silence falls upon the docks;\nand Poll, seeing herself face to face with the horse, and having a mind\nfor a chat, cried out to him, _\u201cBack! back! back!\u201d_\nBackward went the horse, precipitating himself and truck into the\nwater.\nBrunswick Dock, to the west of Prince\u2019s, is one of the most interesting\nto be seen. Here lie the various black steamers (so unlike the American\nboats, since they have to navigate the boisterous Narrow Seas) plying\nto all parts of the three kingdoms. Here you see vast quantities of\nproduce, imported from starving Ireland; here you see the decks turned\ninto pens for oxen and sheep; and often, side by side with these\ninclosures, Irish deck-passengers, thick as they can stand, seemingly\npenned in just like the cattle. It was the beginning of July when the\nHighlander arrived in port; and the Irish laborers were daily coming\nover by thousands, to help harvest the English crops.\nOne morning, going into the town, I heard a tramp, as of a drove of\nbuffaloes, behind me; and turning round, beheld the entire middle of\nthe street filled by a great crowd of these men, who had just emerged\nfrom Brunswick Dock gates, arrayed in long-tailed coats of hoddin-gray,\ncorduroy knee-breeches, and shod with shoes that raised a mighty dust.\nFlourishing their Donnybrook shillelahs, they looked like an irruption\nof barbarians. They were marching straight out of town into the\ncountry; and perhaps out of consideration for the finances of the\ncorporation, took the middle of the street, to save the side-walks.\n\u201cSing _Langolee, and the Lakes of Killarney,\u201d_ cried one fellow,\ntossing his stick into the air, as he danced in his brogans at the head\nof the rabble. And so they went! capering on, merry as pipers.\nWhen I thought of the multitudes of Irish that annually land on the\nshores of the United States and Canada, and, to my surprise, witnessed\nthe additional multitudes embarking from Liverpool to New Holland; and\nwhen, added to all this, I daily saw these hordes of laborers,\ndescending, thick as locusts, upon the English corn-fields; I could not\nhelp marveling at the fertility of an island, which, though her crop of\npotatoes may fail, never yet failed in bringing her annual crop of men\ninto the world.\nCHAPTER XLI.\nREDBURN ROVES ABOUT HITHER AND THITHER\nI do not know that any other traveler would think it worth while to\nmention such a thing; but the fact is, that during the summer months in\nLiverpool, the days are exceedingly lengthy; and the first evening I\nfound myself walking in the twilight after nine o\u2019clock, I tried to\nrecall my astronomical knowledge, in order to account satisfactorily\nfor so curious a phenomenon. But the days in summer, and the nights in\nwinter, are just as long in Liverpool as at Cape Horn; for the latitude\nof the two places very nearly corresponds.\nThese Liverpool days, however, were a famous thing for me; who,\nthereby, was enabled after my day\u2019s work aboard the Highlander, to\nramble about the town for several hours. After I had visited all the\nnoted places I could discover, of those marked down upon my father\u2019s\nmap, I began to extend my rovings indefinitely; forming myself into a\ncommittee of one, to investigate all accessible parts of the town;\nthough so many years have elapsed, ere I have thought of bringing in my\nreport.\nThis was a great delight to me: for wherever I have been in the world,\nI have always taken a vast deal of lonely satisfaction in wandering\nabout, up and down, among out-of-the-way streets and alleys, and\nspeculating upon the strangers I have met. Thus, in Liverpool I used to\npace along endless streets of dwelling-houses, looking at the names on\nthe doors, admiring the pretty faces in the windows, and invoking a\npassing blessing upon the chubby children on the door-steps. I was\nstared at myself, to be sure: but what of that? We must give and take\non such occasions. In truth, I and my shooting-jacket produced quite a\nsensation in Liverpool: and I have no doubt, that many a father of a\nfamily went home to his children with a curious story, about a\nwandering phenomenon they had encountered, traversing the side-walks\nthat day. In the words of the old song, _\u201cI cared for nobody, no not I,\nand nobody cared for me.\u201d_ I stared my fill with impunity, and took all\nstares myself in good part.\nOnce I was standing in a large square, gaping at a splendid chariot\ndrawn up at a portico. The glossy horses quivered with good-living, and\nso did the sumptuous calves of the gold-laced coachman and footmen in\nattendance. I was particularly struck with the red cheeks of these men:\nand the many evidences they furnished of their enjoying this meal with\na wonderful relish.\nWhile thus standing, I all at once perceived, that the objects of my\ncuriosity, were making me an object of their own; and that they were\ngazing at me, as if I were some unauthorized intruder upon the British\nsoil. Truly, they had reason: for when I now think of the figure I must\nhave cut in those days, I only marvel that, in my many strolls, my\npassport was not a thousand times demanded.\nNevertheless, I was only a forlorn looking mortal among tens of\nthousands of rags and tatters. For in some parts of the town, inhabited\nby laborers, and poor people generally; I used to crowd my way through\nmasses of squalid men, women, and children, who at this evening hour,\nin those quarters of Liverpool, seem to empty themselves into the\nstreet, and live there for the time. I had never seen any thing like it\nin New York. Often, I witnessed some curious, and many very sad scenes;\nand especially I remembered encountering a pale, ragged man, rushing\nalong frantically, and striving to throw off his wife and children, who\nclung to his arms and legs; and, in God\u2019s name, conjured him not to\ndesert them. He seemed bent upon rushing down to the water, and\ndrowning himself, in some despair, and craziness of wretchedness. In\nthese haunts, beggary went on before me wherever I walked, and dogged\nme unceasingly at the heels. Poverty, poverty, poverty, in almost\nendless vistas: and want and woe staggered arm in arm along these\nmiserable streets.\nAnd here, I must not omit one thing, that struck me at the time. It was\nthe absence of negroes; who in the large towns in the \u201cfree states\u201d of\nAmerica, almost always form a considerable portion of the destitute.\nBut in these streets, not a negro was to be seen. All were whites; and\nwith the exception of the Irish, were natives of the soil: even\nEnglishmen; as much Englishmen, as the dukes in the House of Lords.\nThis conveyed a strange feeling: and more than any thing else, reminded\nme that I was not in my own land. For _there,_ such a being as a native\nbeggar is almost unknown; and to be a born American citizen seems a\nguarantee against pauperism; and this, perhaps, springs from the virtue\nof a vote.\nSpeaking of negroes, recalls the looks of interest with which\nnegro-sailors are regarded when they walk the Liverpool streets. In\nLiverpool indeed the negro steps with a prouder pace, and lifts his\nhead like a man; for here, no such exaggerated feeling exists in\nrespect to him, as in America. Three or four times, I encountered our\nblack steward, dressed very handsomely, and walking arm in arm with a\ngood-looking English woman. In New York, such a couple would have been\nmobbed in three minutes; and the steward would have been lucky to\nescape with whole limbs. Owing to the friendly reception extended to\nthem, and the unwonted immunities they enjoy in Liverpool, the black\ncooks and stewards of American ships are very much attached to the\nplace and like to make voyages to it.\nBeing so young and inexperienced then, and unconsciously swayed in some\ndegree by those local and social prejudices, that are the marring of\nmost men, and from which, for the mass, there seems no possible escape;\nat first I was surprised that a colored man should be treated as he is\nin this town; but a little reflection showed that, after all, it was\nbut recognizing his claims to humanity and normal equality; so that, in\nsome things, we Americans leave to other countries the carrying out of\nthe principle that stands at the head of our Declaration of\nIndependence.\nDuring my evening strolls in the wealthier quarters, I was subject to a\ncontinual mortification. It was the humiliating fact, wholly unforeseen\nby me, that upon the whole, and barring the poverty and beggary,\nLiverpool, away from the docks, was very much such a place as New York.\nThere were the same sort of streets pretty much; the same rows of\nhouses with stone steps; the same kind of side-walks and curbs; and the\nsame elbowing, heartless-looking crowd as ever.\nI came across the Leeds Canal, one afternoon; but, upon my word, no one\ncould have told it from the Erie Canal at Albany. I went into St.\nJohn\u2019s Market on a Saturday night; and though it was strange enough to\nsee that great roof supported by so many pillars, yet the most\ndiscriminating observer would not have been able to detect any\ndifference between the articles exposed for sale, and the articles\nexhibited in Fulton Market, New York.\nI walked down Lord-street, peering into the jewelers\u2019 shops; but I\nthought I was walking down a block in Broadway. I began to think that\nall this talk about travel was a humbug; and that he who lives in a\nnut-shell, lives in an epitome of the universe, and has but little to\nsee beyond him.\nIt is true, that I often thought of London\u2019s being only seven or eight\nhours\u2019 travel by railroad from where I was; and that _there,_ surely,\nmust be a world of wonders waiting my eyes: but more of London anon.\nSundays were the days upon which I made my longest explorations. I rose\nbright and early, with my whole plan of operations in my head. First\nwalking into some dock hitherto unexamined, and then to breakfast. Then\na walk through the more fashionable streets, to see the people going to\nchurch; and then I myself went to church, selecting the goodliest\nedifice, and the tallest Kentuckian of a spire I could find.\nFor I am an admirer of church architecture; and though, perhaps, the\nsums spent in erecting magnificent cathedrals might better go to the\nfounding of charities, yet since these structures are built, those who\ndisapprove of them in one sense, may as well have the benefit of them\nin another.\nIt is a most Christian thing, and a matter most sweet to dwell upon and\nsimmer over in solitude, that any poor sinner may go to church wherever\nhe pleases; and that even St. Peter\u2019s in Rome is open to him, as to a\ncardinal; that St. Paul\u2019s in London is not shut against him; and that\nthe Broadway Tabernacle, in New York, opens all her broad aisles to\nhim, and will not even have doors and thresholds to her pews, the\nbetter to allure him by an unbounded invitation. I say, this\nconsideration of the hospitality and democracy in churches, is a most\nChristian and charming thought. It speaks whole volumes of folios, and\nVatican libraries, for Christianity; it is more eloquent, and goes\nfarther home than all the sermons of Massillon, Jeremy Taylor, Wesley,\nand Archbishop Tillotson.\nNothing daunted, therefore, by thinking of my being a stranger in the\nland; nothing daunted by the architectural superiority and costliness\nof any Liverpool church; or by the streams of silk dresses and fine\nbroadcloth coats flowing into the aisles, I used humbly to present\nmyself before the sexton, as a candidate for admission. He would stare\na little, perhaps (one of them once hesitated), but in the end, what\ncould he do but show me into a pew; not the most commodious of pews, to\nbe sure; nor commandingly located; nor within very plain sight or\nhearing of the pulpit. No; it was remarkable, that there was always\nsome confounded pillar or obstinate angle of the wall in the way; and I\nused to think, that the sextons of Liverpool must have held a secret\nmeeting on my account, and resolved to apportion me the most\ninconvenient pew in the churches under their charge. However, they\nalways gave me a seat of some sort or other; sometimes even on an oaken\nbench in the open air of the aisle, where I would sit, dividing the\nattention of the congregation between myself and the clergyman. The\nwhole congregation seemed to know that I was a foreigner of\ndistinction.\nIt was sweet to hear the service read, the organ roll, the sermon\npreached\u2014just as the same things were going on three thousand five\nhundred miles off, at home! But then, the prayer in behalf of her\nmajesty the Queen, somewhat threw me back. Nevertheless, I joined in\nthat prayer, and invoked for the lady the best wishes of a poor Yankee.\nHow I loved to sit in the holy hush of those brown old monastic aisles,\nthinking of Harry the Eighth, and the Reformation! How I loved to go a\nroving with my eye, all along the sculptured walls and buttresses;\nwinding in among the intricacies of the pendent ceiling, and wriggling\nmy fancied way like a wood-worm. I could have sat there all the morning\nlong, through noon, unto night. But at last the benediction would come;\nand appropriating my share of it, I would slowly move away, thinking\nhow I should like to go home with some of the portly old gentlemen,\nwith high-polished boots and Malacca canes, and take a seat at their\ncosy and comfortable dinner-tables. But, alas! there was no dinner for\nme except at the sign of the Baltimore Clipper.\nYet the Sunday dinners that Handsome Mary served up were not to be\nscorned. The roast beef of Old England abounded; and so did the\nimmortal plum-puddings, and the unspeakably capital gooseberry pies.\nBut to finish off with that abominable _\u201cswipes\u201d_ almost spoiled all\nthe rest: not that I myself patronized _\u201cswipes\u201d_ but my shipmates did;\nand every cup I saw them drink, I could not choose but taste in\nimagination, and even then the flavor was bad.\nOn Sundays, at dinner-time, as, indeed, on every other day, it was\ncurious to watch the proceedings at the sign of the Clipper. The\nservant girls were running about, mustering the various crews, whose\ndinners were spread, each in a separate apartment; and who were\ncollectively known by the names of their ships.\n\u201cWhere are the _Arethusas?\u2014_Here\u2019s their beef been smoking this\nhalf-hour.\u201d\u2014\u201cFly, Betty, my dear, here come the _Splendids.\u201d\u2014_ \u201cRun,\nMolly, my love; get the salt-cellars for the _Highlanders_ .\u201d\u2014\u201cYou\nPeggy, where\u2019s the _Siddons\u2019 pickle-pat?\u201d\u2014\u201cI_ say, Judy, are you never\ncoming with that pudding for the _Lord Nelsons?\u201d_\nOn week days, we did not fare quite so well as on Sundays; and once we\ncame to dinner, and found two enormous bullock hearts smoking at each\nend of the Highlanders\u2019 table. Jackson was indignant at the outrage.\nHe always sat at the head of the table; and this time he squared\nhimself on his bench, and erecting his knife and fork like flag-staffs,\nso as to include the two hearts between them, he called out for Danby,\nthe boarding-house keeper; for although his wife Mary was in fact at\nthe head of the establishment, yet Danby himself always came in for the\nfault-findings.\nDanby obsequiously appeared, and stood in the doorway, well knowing the\nphilippics that were coming. But he was not prepared for the peroration\nof Jackson\u2019s address to him; which consisted of the two bullock hearts,\nsnatched bodily off the dish, and flung at his head, by way of a\nrecapitulation of the preceding arguments. The company then broke up in\ndisgust, and dined elsewhere.\nThough I almost invariably attended church on Sunday mornings, yet the\nrest of the day I spent on my travels; and it was on one of these\nafternoon strolls, that on passing through St. George\u2019s-square, I found\nmyself among a large crowd, gathered near the base of George the\nFourth\u2019s equestrian statue.\nThe people were mostly mechanics and artisans in their holiday clothes;\nbut mixed with them were a good many soldiers, in lean, lank, and\ndinnerless undresses, and sporting attenuated rattans. These troops\nbelonged to the various regiments then in town. Police officers, also,\nwere conspicuous in their uniforms. At first perfect silence and\ndecorum prevailed.\nAddressing this orderly throng was a pale, hollow-eyed young man, in a\nsnuff-colored surtout, who looked worn with much watching, or much\ntoil, or too little food. His features were good, his whole air was\nrespectable, and there was no mistaking the fact, that he was strongly\nin earnest in what he was saying.\nIn his hand was a soiled, inflammatory-looking pamphlet, from which he\nfrequently read; following up the quotations with nervous appeals to\nhis hearers, a rolling of his eyes, and sometimes the most frantic\ngestures. I was not long within hearing of him, before I became aware\nthat this youth was a Chartist.\nPresently the crowd increased, and some commotion was raised, when I\nnoticed the police officers augmenting in number; and by and by, they\nbegan to glide through the crowd, politely hinting at the propriety of\ndispersing. The first persons thus accosted were the soldiers, who\naccordingly sauntered off, switching their rattans, and admiring their\nhigh-polished shoes. It was plain that the Charter did not hang very\nheavy round their hearts. For the rest, they also gradually broke up;\nand at last I saw the speaker himself depart.\nI do not know why, but I thought he must be some despairing elder son,\nsupporting by hard toil his mother and sisters; for of such many\npolitical desperadoes are made.\nThat same Sunday afternoon, I strolled toward the outskirts of the\ntown, and attracted by the sight of two great Pompey\u2019s pillars, in the\nshape of black steeples, apparently rising directly from the soil, I\napproached them with much curiosity. But looking over a low parapet\nconnecting them, what was my surprise to behold at my feet a smoky\nhollow in the ground, with rocky walls, and dark holes at one end,\ncarrying out of view several lines of iron railways; while far beyond,\nstraight out toward the open country, ran an endless railroad. Over the\nplace, a handsome Moorish arch of stone was flung; and gradually, as I\ngazed upon it, and at the little side arches at the bottom of the\nhollow, there came over me an undefinable feeling, that I had\npreviously seen the whole thing before. Yet how could that be?\nCertainly, I had never been in Liverpool before: but then, that Moorish\narch! surely I remembered that very well. It was not till several\nmonths after reaching home in America, that my perplexity upon this\nmatter was cleared away. In glancing over an old number of the Penny\nMagazine, there I saw a picture of the place to the life; and\nremembered having seen the same print years previous. It was a\nrepresentation of the spot where the Manchester railroad enters the\noutskirts of the town.\nCHAPTER XLII.\nHIS ADVENTURE WITH THE _CROSS_ OLD GENTLEMAN\nMy adventure in the News-Room in the Exchange, which I have related in\na previous chapter, reminds me of another, at the Lyceum, some days\nafter, which may as well be put down here, before I forget it.\nI was strolling down Bold-street, I think it was, when I was struck by\nthe sight of a brown stone building, very large and handsome. The\nwindows were open, and there, nicely seated, with their comfortable\nlegs crossed over their comfortable knees, I beheld several sedate,\nhappy-looking old gentlemen reading the magazines and papers, and one\nhad a fine gilded volume in his hand.\nYes, this must be the Lyceum, thought I; let me see. So I whipped out\nmy guide-book, and opened it at the proper place; and sure enough, the\nbuilding before me corresponded stone for stone. I stood awhile on the\nopposite side of the street, gazing at my picture, and then at its\noriginal; and often dwelling upon the pleasant gentlemen sitting at the\nopen windows; till at last I felt an uncontrollable impulse to step in\nfor a moment, and run over the news.\nI\u2019m a poor, friendless sailor-boy, thought I, and they can not object;\nespecially as I am from a foreign land, and strangers ought to be\ntreated with courtesy. I turned the matter over again, as I walked\nacross the way; and with just a small tapping of a misgiving at my\nheart, I at last scraped my feet clean against the curb-stone, and\ntaking off my hat while I was yet in the open air, slowly sauntered in.\nBut I had not got far into that large and lofty room, filled with many\nagreeable sights, when a crabbed old gentleman lifted up his eye from\nthe _London Times,_ which words I saw boldly printed on the back of the\nlarge sheet in his hand, and looking at me as if I were a strange dog\nwith a muddy hide, that had stolen out of the gutter into this fine\napartment, he shook his silver-headed cane at me fiercely, till the\nspectacles fell off his nose. Almost at the same moment, up stepped a\nterribly cross man, who looked as if he had a mustard plaster on his\nback, that was continually exasperating him; who throwing down some\npapers which he had been filing, took me by my innocent shoulders, and\nthen, putting his foot against the broad part of my pantaloons, wheeled\nme right out into the street, and dropped me on the walk, without so\nmuch as offering an apology for the affront. I sprang after him, but in\nvain; the door was closed upon me.\nThese Englishmen have no manners, that\u2019s plain, thought I; and I\ntrudged on down the street in a reverie.\nCHAPTER XLIII.\nHE TAKES A DELIGHTFUL RAMBLE INTO THE COUNTRY; AND MAKES THE\nACQUAINTANCE OF THREE ADORABLE CHARMERS\nWho that dwells in America has not heard of the bright fields and green\nhedges of England, and longed to behold them? Even so had it been with\nme; and now that I was actually in England, I resolved not to go away\nwithout having a good, long look at the open fields.\nOn a Sunday morning I started, with a lunch in my pocket. It was a\nbeautiful day in July; the air was sweet with the breath of buds and\nflowers, and there was a green splendor in the landscape that ravished\nme. Soon I gained an elevation commanding a wide sweep of view; and\nmeadow and mead, and woodland and hedge, were all around me.\nAy, ay! this was old England, indeed! I had found it at last\u2014there it\nwas in the country! Hovering over the scene was a soft, dewy air, that\nseemed faintly tinged with the green of the grass; and I thought, as I\nbreathed my breath, that perhaps I might be inhaling the very particles\nonce respired by Rosamond the Fair.\nOn I trudged along the London road\u2014smooth as an entry floor\u2014and every\nwhite cottage I passed, embosomed in honeysuckles, seemed alive in the\nlandscape.\nBut the day wore on; and at length the sun grew hot; and the long road\nbecame dusty. I thought that some shady place, in some shady field,\nwould be very pleasant to repose in. So, coming to a charming little\ndale, undulating down to a hollow, arched over with foliage, I crossed\nover toward it; but paused by the road-side at a frightful\nannouncement, nailed against an old tree, used as a gate-post\u2014\n\u201cMAN-TRAPS AND SPRING-GUNS!\u201d\nIn America I had never heard of the like. What could it mean? They were\nnot surely _cannibals,_ that dwelt down in that beautiful little dale,\nand lived by catching men, like weasels and beavers in Canada!\n\u201cA _man-trap!\u201d_ It must be so. The announcement could bear but one\nmeaning\u2014that there was something near by, intended to catch human\nbeings; some species of mechanism, that would suddenly fasten upon the\nunwary rover, and hold him by the leg like a dog; or, perhaps, devour\nhim on the spot.\nIncredible! In a Christian land, too! Did that sweet lady, Queen\nVictoria, permit such diabolical practices? Had her gracious majesty\never passed by this way, and seen the announcement?\nAnd who put it there?\nThe proprietor, probably.\nAnd what right had he to do so?\nWhy, he owned the soil.\nAnd where are his title-deeds?\nIn his strong-box, I suppose.\nThus I stood wrapt in cogitations.\nYou are a pretty fellow, Wellingborough, thought I to myself; you are a\nmighty traveler, indeed:\u2014stopped on your travels by a _man-trap!_ Do\nyou think Mungo Park was so served in Africa? Do you think Ledyard was\nso entreated in Siberia? Upon my word, you will go home not very much\nwiser than when you set out; and the only excuse you can give, for not\nhaving seen more sights, will be _man-traps\u2014mantraps, my masters!_ that\nfrightened you!\nAnd then, in my indignation, I fell back upon first principles. What\nright has this man to the soil he thus guards with dragons? What\nexcessive effrontery, to lay sole claim to a solid piece of this\nplanet, right down to the earth\u2019s axis, and, perhaps, straight through\nto the antipodes! For a moment I thought I would test his traps, and\nenter the forbidden Eden.\nBut the grass grew so thickly, and seemed so full of sly things, that\nat last I thought best to pace off.\nNext, I came to a hawthorn lane, leading down very prettily to a nice\nlittle church; a mossy little church; a beautiful little church; just\nsuch a church as I had always dreamed to be in England. The porch was\nviny as an arbor; the ivy was climbing about the tower; and the bees\nwere humming about the hoary old head-stones along the walls.\nAny man-traps here? thought I\u2014any spring-guns?\nNo.\nSo I walked on, and entered the church, where I soon found a seat. No\nIndian, red as a deer, could have startled the simple people more. They\ngazed and they gazed; but as I was all attention to the sermon, and\nconducted myself with perfect propriety, they did not expel me, as at\nfirst I almost imagined they might.\nService over, I made my way through crowds of children, who stood\nstaring at the marvelous stranger, and resumed my stroll along the\nLondon Road.\nMy next stop was at an inn, where under a tree sat a party of rustics,\ndrinking ale at a table.\n\u201cGood day,\u201d said I.\n\u201cGood day; from Liverpool?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\u201cFor London?\u201d\n\u201cNo; not this time. I merely come to see the country.\u201d\nAt this, they gazed at each other; and I, at myself; having doubts\nwhether I might not look something like a horse-thief.\n\u201cTake a seat,\u201d said the landlord, a fat fellow, with his wife\u2019s apron\non, I thought.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nAnd then, little by little, we got into a long talk: in the course of\nwhich, I told who I was, and where I was from. I found these rustics a\ngood-natured, jolly set; and I have no doubt they found me quite a\nsociable youth. They treated me to ale; and I treated them to stories\nabout America, concerning which, they manifested the utmost curiosity.\nOne of them, however, was somewhat astonished that I had not made the\nacquaintance of a brother of his, who had resided somewhere on the\nbanks of the Mississippi for several years past; but among twenty\nmillions of people, I had never happened to meet him, at least to my\nknowledge.\nAt last, leaving this party, I pursued my way, exhilarated by the\nlively conversation in which I had shared, and the pleasant sympathies\nexchanged: and perhaps, also, by the ale I had drunk:\u2014fine old ale;\nyes, English ale, ale brewed in England! And I trod English soil; and\nbreathed English air; and every blade of grass was an Englishman born.\nSmoky old Liverpool, with all its pitch and tar was now far behind;\nnothing in sight but open meadows and fields.\nCome, Wellingborough, why not push on for London?\u2014 Hurra! what say you?\nlet\u2019s have a peep at St. Paul\u2019s? Don\u2019t you want to see the queen? Have\nyou no longing to behold the duke? Think of Westminster Abbey, and the\nTunnel under the Thames! Think of Hyde Park, and the ladies!\nBut then, thought I again, with my hands wildly groping in my two\nvacuums of pockets\u2014who\u2019s to pay the bill?\u2014You can\u2019t beg your way,\nWellingborough; that would never do; for you are your father\u2019s son,\nWellingborough; and you must not disgrace your family in a foreign\nland; you must not turn pauper.\nAh! Ah! it was indeed too true; there was no St. Paul\u2019s or Westminster\nAbbey for me; that was flat.\nWell, well, up heart, you\u2019ll see it one of these days.\nBut think of it! here I am on the very road that leads to the\nThames\u2014think of _that!\u2014_here I am\u2014ay, treading in the wheel-tracks of\ncoaches that are bound for the metropolis!\u2014It was too bad; too bitterly\nbad. But I shoved my old hat over my brows, and walked on; till at last\nI came to a green bank, deliriously shaded by a fine old tree with\nbroad branching arms, that stretched themselves over the road, like a\nhen gathering her brood under her wings. Down on the green grass I\nthrew myself and there lay my head, like a last year\u2019s nut. People\npassed by, on foot and in carriages, and little thought that the sad\nyouth under the tree was the great-nephew of a late senator in the\nAmerican Congress.\nPresently, I started to my feet, as I heard a gruff voice behind me\nfrom the field, crying out\u2014\u201cWhat are you doing there, you young\nrascal?\u2014run away from the work\u2019us, have ye? Tramp, or I\u2019ll set Blucher\non ye!\u201d\nAnd who was Blucher? A cut-throat looking dog, with his black\nbull-muzzle thrust through a gap in the hedge. And his master? A sturdy\nfarmer, with an alarming cudgel in his hand.\n\u201cCome, are you going to start?\u201d he cried.\n\u201cPresently,\u201d said I, making off with great dispatch. When I had got a\nfew yards into the middle of the highroad (which belonged as much to me\nas it did to the queen herself), I turned round, like a man on his own\npremises, and said\u2014 \u201cStranger! if you ever visit America, just call at\nour house, and you\u2019ll always find there a dinner and a bed. Don\u2019t\nfail.\u201d\nI then walked on toward Liverpool, full of sad thoughts concerning the\ncold charities of the world, and the infamous reception given to\nhapless young travelers, in broken-down shooting-jackets.\nOn, on I went, along the skirts of forbidden green fields; until\nreaching a cottage, before which I stood rooted.\nSo sweet a place I had never seen: no palace in Persia could be\npleasanter; there were flowers in the garden; and six red cheeks, like\nsix moss-roses, hanging from the casement. At the embowered doorway,\nsat an old man, confidentially communing with his pipe: while a little\nchild, sprawling on the ground, was playing with his shoestrings. A\nhale matron, but with rather a prim expression, was reading a journal\nby his side: and three charmers, three Peris, three Houris! were\nleaning out of the window close by.\nAh! Wellingborough, don\u2019t you wish you could step in?\nWith a heavy heart at his cheerful sigh, I was turning to go, when\u2014is\nit possible? the old man called me back, and invited me in.\n\u201cCome, come,\u201d said he, \u201cyou look as if you had walked far; come, take a\nbowl of milk. Matilda, my dear\u201d (how my heart jumped), \u201cgo fetch some\nfrom the dairy.\u201d And the white-handed angel did meekly obey, and handed\n_me\u2014me,_ the vagabond, a bowl of bubbling milk, which I could hardly\ndrink down, for gazing at the dew on her lips.\nAs I live, I could have married that charmer on the spot!\nShe was by far the most beautiful rosebud I had yet seen in England.\nBut I endeavored to dissemble my ardent admiration; and in order to do\naway at once with any unfavorable impressions arising from the close\nscrutiny of my miserable shooting-jacket, which was now taking place, I\ndeclared myself a Yankee sailor from Liverpool, who was spending a\nSunday in the country.\n\u201cAnd have you been to church to-day, young man?\u201d said the old lady,\nlooking daggers.\n\u201cGood madam, I have; the little church down yonder, you know\u2014a most\nexcellent sermon\u2014I am much the better for it.\u201d\nI wanted to mollify this severe looking old lady; for even my short\nexperience of old ladies had convinced me that they are the hereditary\nenemies of all strange young men.\nI soon turned the conversation toward America, a theme which I knew\nwould be interesting, and upon which I could be fluent and agreeable. I\nstrove to talk in Addisonian English, and ere long could see very\nplainly that my polished phrases were making a surprising impression,\nthough that miserable shooting-jacket of mine was a perpetual drawback\nto my claims to gentility.\nSpite of all my blandishments, however, the old lady stood her post\nlike a sentry; and to my inexpressible chagrin, kept the three charmers\nin the background, though the old man frequently called upon them to\nadvance. This fine specimen of an old Englishman seemed to be quite as\nfree from ungenerous suspicions as his vinegary spouse was full of\nthem. But I still lingered, snatching furtive glances at the young\nladies, and vehemently talking to the old man about Illinois, and the\nriver Ohio, and the fine farms in the Genesee country, where, in\nharvest time, the laborers went into the wheat fields a thousand\nstrong.\nStick to it, Wellingborough, thought I; don\u2019t give the old lady time to\nthink; stick to it, my boy, and an invitation to tea will reward you.\nAt last it came, and the old lady abated her frowns.\nIt was the most delightful of meals; the three charmers sat all on one\nside, and I opposite, between the old man and his wife. The middle\ncharmer poured out the souchong, and handed me the buttered muffins;\nand such buttered muffins never were spread on the other side of the\nAtlantic. The butter had an aromatic flavor; by Jove, it was perfectly\ndelicious.\nAnd there they sat\u2014the charmers, I mean\u2014eating these buttered muffins\nin plain sight. I wished I was a buttered muffin myself. Every minute\nthey grew handsomer and handsomer; and I could not help thinking what a\nfine thing it would be to carry home a beautiful English wife! how my\nfriends would stare! a lady from England!\nI might have been mistaken; but certainly I thought that Matilda, the\none who had handed me the milk, sometimes looked rather benevolently in\nthe direction where I sat. She certainly _did_ look at my jacket; and I\nam constrained to think at my face. Could it be possible she had fallen\nin love at first sight? Oh, rapture! But oh, misery! that was out of\nthe question; for what a looking suitor was Wellingborough?\nAt length, the old lady glanced toward the door, and made some\nobservations about its being yet a long walk to town. She handed me the\nbuttered muffins, too, as if performing a final act of hospitality; and\nin other fidgety ways vaguely hinted her desire that I should decamp.\nSlowly I rose, and murmured my thanks, and bowed, and tried to be off;\nbut as quickly I turned, and bowed, and thanked, and lingered again and\nagain. Oh, charmers! oh, Peris! thought I, must I go? Yes,\nWellingborough, you must; so I made one desperate congee, and darted\nthrough the door.\nI have never seen them since: no, nor heard of them; but to this day I\nlive a bachelor on account of those ravishing charmers.\nAs the long twilight was waning deeper and deeper into the night, I\nentered the town; and, plodding my solitary way to the same old docks,\nI passed through the gates, and scrambled my way among tarry smells,\nacross the tiers of ships between the quay and the Highlander. My only\nresource was my bunk; in I turned, and, wearied with my long stroll,\nwas soon fast asleep, dreaming of red cheeks and roses.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\nREDBURN INTRODUCES MASTER HARRY BOLTON TO THE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION\nOF THE READER\nIt was the day following my Sunday stroll into the country, and when I\nhad been in England four weeks or more, that I made the acquaintance of\na handsome, accomplished, but unfortunate youth, young Harry Bolton. He\nwas one of those small, but perfectly formed beings, with curling hair,\nand silken muscles, who seem to have been born in cocoons. His\ncomplexion was a mantling brunette, feminine as a girl\u2019s; his feet were\nsmall; his hands were white; and his eyes were large, black, and\nwomanly; and, poetry aside, his voice was as the sound of a harp.\nBut where, among the tarry docks, and smoky sailor-lanes and by-ways of\na seaport, did I, a battered Yankee boy, encounter this courtly youth?\nSeveral evenings I had noticed him in our street of boarding-houses,\nstanding in the doorways, and silently regarding the animated scenes\nwithout. His beauty, dress, and manner struck me as so out of place in\nsuch a street, that I could not possibly divine what had transplanted\nthis delicate exotic from the conservatories of some Regent-street to\nthe untidy potato-patches of Liverpool.\nAt last I suddenly encountered him at the sign of the Baltimore\nClipper. He was speaking to one of my shipmates concerning America; and\nfrom something that dropped, I was led to imagine that he contemplated\na voyage to my country. Charmed with his appearance, and all eagerness\nto enjoy the society of this incontrovertible son of a gentleman\u2014a kind\nof pleasure so long debarred me\u2014I smoothed down the skirts of my\njacket, and at once accosted him; declaring who I was, and that nothing\nwould afford me greater delight than to be of the least service, in\nimparting any information concerning America that he needed.\nHe glanced from my face to my jacket, and from my jacket to my face,\nand at length, with a pleased but somewhat puzzled expression, begged\nme to accompany him on a walk.\nWe rambled about St. George\u2019s Pier until nearly midnight; but before we\nparted, with uncommon frankness, he told me many strange things\nrespecting his history.\nAccording to his own account, Harry Bolton was a native of Bury St.\nEdmunds, a borough of Suffolk, not very far from London, where he was\nearly left an orphan, under the charge of an only aunt. Between his\naunt and himself, his mother had divided her fortune; and young Harry\nthus fell heir to a portion of about five thousand pounds.\nBeing of a roving mind, as he approached his majority he grew restless\nof the retirement of a country place; especially as he had no\nprofession or business of any kind to engage his attention.\nIn vain did Bury, with all its fine old monastic attractions, lure him\nto abide on the beautiful banks of her Larke, and under the shadow of\nher stately and storied old Saxon tower.\nBy all my rare old historic associations, breathed Bury; by my\nAbbey-gate, that bears to this day the arms of Edward the Confessor; by\nmy carved roof of the old church of St. Mary\u2019s, which escaped the low\nrage of the bigoted Puritans; by the royal ashes of Mary Tudor, that\nsleep in my midst; by my Norman ruins, and by all the old abbots of\nBury, do not, oh Harry! abandon me. Where will you find shadier walks\nthan under my lime-trees? where lovelier gardens than those within the\nold walls of my monastery, approached through my lordly Gate? Or if, oh\nHarry! indifferent to my historic mosses, and caring not for my annual\nverdure, thou must needs be lured by other tassels, and wouldst fain,\nlike the Prodigal, squander thy patrimony, then, go not away from old\nBury to do it. For here, on Angel-Hill, are my coffee and card-rooms,\nand billiard saloons, where you may lounge away your mornings, and\nempty your glass and your purse as you list.\nIn vain. Bury was no place for the adventurous Harry, who must needs\nhie to London, where in one winter, in the company of gambling\nsportsmen and dandies, he lost his last sovereign.\nWhat now was to be done? His friends made interest for him in the\nrequisite quarters, and Harry was soon embarked for Bombay, as a\nmidshipman in the East India service; in which office he was known as a\n_\u201cguinea-pig,\u201d_ a humorous appellation then bestowed upon the middies\nof the Company. And considering the perversity of his behavior, his\ndelicate form, and soft complexion, and that gold guineas had been his\nbane, this appellation was not altogether, in poor Harry\u2019s case,\ninapplicable.\nHe made one voyage, and returned; another, and returned; and then threw\nup his warrant in disgust. A few weeks\u2019 dissipation in London, and\nagain his purse was almost drained; when, like many prodigals, scorning\nto return home to his aunt, and amend\u2014though she had often written him\nthe kindest of letters to that effect\u2014Harry resolved to precipitate\nhimself upon the New World, and there carve out a fresh fortune. With\nthis object in view, he packed his trunks, and took the first train for\nLiverpool. Arrived in that town, he at once betook himself to the\ndocks, to examine the American shipping, when a new crotchet entered\nhis brain, born of his old sea reminiscences. It was to assume duck\nbrowsers and tarpaulin, and gallantly cross the Atlantic as a sailor.\nThere was a dash of romance in it; a taking abandonment; and scorn of\nfine coats, which exactly harmonized with his reckless contempt, at the\ntime, for all past conventionalities.\nThus determined, he exchanged his trunk for a mahogany chest; sold some\nof his superfluities; and moved his quarters to the sign of the Gold\nAnchor in Union-street.\nAfter making his acquaintance, and learning his intentions, I was all\nanxiety that Harry should accompany me home in the Highlander, a desire\nto which he warmly responded.\nNor was I without strong hopes that he would succeed in an application\nto the captain; inasmuch as during our stay in the docks, three of our\ncrew had left us, and their places would remain unsupplied till just\nupon the eve of our departure.\nAnd here, it may as well be related, that owing to the heavy charges to\nwhich the American ships long staying in Liverpool are subjected, from\nthe obligation to continue the wages of their seamen, when they have\nlittle or no work to employ them, and from the necessity of boarding\nthem ashore, like lords, at their leisure, captains interested in the\nownership of their vessels, are not at all indisposed to let their\nsailors abscond, if they please, and thus forfeit their money; for they\nwell know that, when wanted, a new crew is easily to be procured,\nthrough the crimps of the port.\nThough he spake English with fluency, and from his long service in the\nvessels of New York, was almost an American to behold, yet Captain Riga\nwas in fact a Russian by birth, though this was a fact that he strove\nto conceal. And though extravagant in his personal expenses, and even\nindulging in luxurious habits, costly as Oriental dissipation, yet\nCaptain Riga was a niggard to others; as, indeed, was evinced in the\nmagnificent stipend of three dollars, with which he requited my own\nvaluable services. Therefore, as it was agreed between Harry and me,\nthat he should offer to ship as a _\u201cboy,\u201d_ at the same rate of\ncompensation with myself, I made no doubt that, incited by the\ncheapness of the bargain, Captain Riga would gladly close with him; and\nthus, instead of paying sixteen dollars a month to a thorough-going\ntar, who would consume all his rations, buy up my young blade of Bury,\nat the rate of half a dollar a week; with the cheering prospect, that\nby the end of the voyage, his fastidious palate would be the means of\nleaving a handsome balance of salt beef and pork in the _harness-cask._\nWith part of the money obtained by the sale of a few of his velvet\nvests, Harry, by my advice, now rigged himself in a Guernsey frock and\nman-of-war browsers; and thus equipped, he made his appearance, one\nfine morning, on the quarterdeck of the Highlander, gallantly doffing\nhis virgin tarpaulin before the redoubtable Riga.\nNo sooner were his wishes made known, than I perceived in the captain\u2019s\nface that same bland, benevolent, and bewitchingly merry expression,\nthat had so charmed, but deceived me, when, with Mr. Jones, I had first\naccosted him in the cabin.\nAlas, Harry! thought I,\u2014as I stood upon the forecastle looking astern\nwhere they stood,\u2014that _\u201cgallant, gay deceiver\u201d_ shall not altogether\ncajole you, if Wellingborough can help it. Rather than that should be\nthe case, indeed, I would forfeit the pleasure of your society across\nthe Atlantic.\nAt this interesting interview the captain expressed a sympathetic\nconcern touching the sad necessities, which he took upon himself to\npresume must have driven Harry to sea; he confessed to a warm interest\nin his future welfare; and did not hesitate to declare that, in going\nto America, under such circumstances, to seek his fortune, he was\nacting a manly and spirited part; and that the voyage thither, as a\nsailor, would be an invigorating preparative to the landing upon a\nshore, where he must battle out his fortune with Fate.\nHe engaged him at once; but was sorry to say, that he could not provide\nhim a home on board till the day previous to the sailing of the ship;\nand during the interval, he could not honor any drafts upon the\nstrength of his wages.\nHowever, glad enough to conclude the agreement upon any terms at all,\nmy young blade of Bury expressed his satisfaction; and full of\nadmiration at so urbane and gentlemanly a sea-captain, he came forward\nto receive my congratulations.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said I, \u201cbe not deceived by the fascinating Riga\u2014that gay\nLothario of all inexperienced, sea-going youths, from the capital or\nthe country; he has a Janus-face, Harry; and you will not know him when\nhe gets you out of sight of land, and mouths his cast-off coats and\nbrowsers. For _then_ he is another personage altogether, and adjusts\nhis character to the shabbiness of his integuments. No more condolings\nand sympathy then; no more blarney; he will hold you a little better\nthan his boots, and would no more think of addressing you than of\ninvoking wooden Donald, the figure-head on our bows.\u201d\nAnd I further admonished my friend concerning our crew, particularly of\nthe diabolical Jackson, and warned him to be cautious and wary. I told\nhim, that unless he was somewhat accustomed to the rigging, and could\nfurl a royal in a squall, he would be sure to subject himself to a sort\nof treatment from the sailors, in the last degree ignominious to any\nmortal who had ever crossed his legs under mahogany.\nAnd I played the inquisitor, in cross-questioning Harry respecting the\nprecise degree in which he was a practical sailor;\u2014whether he had a\ngiddy head; whether his arms could bear the weight of his body;\nwhether, with but one hand on a shroud, a hundred feet aloft in a\ntempest, he felt he could look right to windward and beard it.\nTo all this, and much more, Harry rejoined with the most off-hand and\nconfident air; saying that in his _\u201cguinea-pig\u201d_ days, he had often\nclimbed the masts and handled the sails in a gentlemanly and amateur\nway; so he made no doubt that he would very soon prove an expert\ntumbler in the Highlander\u2019s rigging.\nHis levity of manner, and sanguine assurance, coupled with the constant\nsight of his most unseamanlike person\u2014more suited to the Queen\u2019s\ndrawing-room than a ship\u2019s forecastle-bred many misgivings in my mind.\nBut after all, every one in this world has his own fate intrusted to\nhimself; and though we may warn, and forewarn, and give sage advice,\nand indulge in many apprehensions touching our friends; yet our\nfriends, for the most part, will _\u201cgang their ain gate;\u201d_ and the most\nwe can do is, to hope for the best. Still, I suggested to Harry,\nwhether he had not best cross the sea as a steerage passenger, since he\ncould procure enough money for that; but no, he was bent upon going as\na sailor.\nI now had a comrade in my afternoon strolls, and Sunday excursions; and\nas Harry was a generous fellow, he shared with me his purse and his\nheart. He sold off several more of his fine vests and browsers, his\nsilver-keyed flute and enameled guitar; and a portion of the money thus\nfurnished was pleasantly spent in refreshing ourselves at the road-side\ninns in the vicinity of the town.\nReclining side by side in some agreeable nook, we exchanged our\nexperiences of the past. Harry enlarged upon the fascinations of a\nLondon life; described the curricle he used to drive in Hyde Park; gave\nme the measurement of Madame Vestris\u2019 ankle; alluded to his first\nintroduction at a club to the madcap Marquis of Waterford; told over\nthe sums he had lost upon the turf on a Derby day; and made various but\nenigmatical allusions to a certain Lady Georgiana Theresa, the noble\ndaughter of an anonymous earl.\nEven in conversation, Harry was a prodigal; squandering his\naristocratic narrations with a careless hand; and, perhaps, sometimes\nspending funds of reminiscences not his own.\nAs for me, I had only my poor old uncle the senator to fall back upon;\nand I used him upon all emergencies, like the knight in the game of\nchess; making him hop about, and stand stiffly up to the encounter,\nagainst all my fine comrade\u2019s array of dukes, lords, curricles, and\ncountesses.\nIn these long talks of ours, I frequently expressed the earnest desire\nI cherished, to make a visit to London; and related how strongly\ntempted I had been one Sunday, to walk the whole way, without a penny\nin my pocket. To this, Harry rejoined, that nothing would delight him\nmore, than to show me the capital; and he even meaningly but\nmysteriously hinted at the possibility of his doing so, before many\ndays had passed. But this seemed so idle a thought, that I only imputed\nit to my friend\u2019s good-natured, rattling disposition, which sometimes\nprompted him to out with any thing, that he thought would be agreeable.\nBesides, would this fine blade of Bury be seen, by his aristocratic\nacquaintances, walking down Oxford-street, say, arm in arm with the\nsleeve of my shooting-jacket? The thing was preposterous; and I began\nto think, that Harry, after all, was a little bit disposed to impose\nupon my Yankee credulity.\nLuckily, my Bury blade had no acquaintance in Liverpool, where, indeed,\nhe was as much in a foreign land, as if he were already on the shores\nof Lake Erie; so that he strolled about with me in perfect abandonment;\nreckless of the cut of my shooting-jacket; and not caring one whit who\nmight stare at so singular a couple.\nBut once, crossing a square, faced on one side by a fashionable hotel,\nhe made a rapid turn with me round a corner; and never stopped, till\nthe square was a good block in our rear. The cause of this sudden\nretreat, was a remarkably elegant coat and pantaloons, standing upright\non the hotel steps, and containing a young buck, tapping his teeth with\nan ivory-headed riding-whip.\n\u201cWho was he, Harry?\u201d said I.\n\u201cMy old chum, Lord Lovely,\u201d said Harry, with a careless air, \u201cand\nHeaven only knows what brings Lovely from London.\u201d\n\u201cA lord?\u201d said I starting; \u201cthen I must look at him again;\u201d for lords\nare very scarce in Liverpool.\nUnmindful of my companion\u2019s remonstrances, I ran back to the corner;\nand slowly promenaded past the upright coat and pantaloons on the\nsteps.\nIt was not much of a lord to behold; very thin and limber about the\nlegs, with small feet like a doll\u2019s, and a small, glossy head like a\nseal\u2019s. I had seen just such looking lords standing in sentimental\nattitudes in front of Palmo\u2019s in Broadway.\nHowever, he and I being mutual friends of Harry\u2019s, I thought something\nof accosting him, and taking counsel concerning what was best to be\ndone for the young prodigal\u2019s welfare; but upon second thoughts I\nthought best not to intrude; especially, as just then my lord Lovely\nstepped to the open window of a flashing carriage which drew up; and\nthrowing himself into an interesting posture, with the sole of one boot\nvertically exposed, so as to show the stamp on it\u2014a coronet\u2014fell into a\nsparkling conversation with a magnificent white satin hat, surmounted\nby a regal marabou feather, inside.\nI doubted not, this lady was nothing short of a peeress; and thought it\nwould be one of the pleasantest and most charming things in the world,\njust to seat myself beside her, and order the coachman to take us a\ndrive into the country.\nBut, as upon further consideration, I imagined that the peeress might\ndecline the honor of my company, since I had no formal card of\nintroduction; I marched on, and rejoined my companion, whom I at once\nendeavored to draw out, touching Lord Lovely; but he only made\nmysterious answers; and turned off the conversation, by allusions to\nhis visits to Ickworth in Suffolk, the magnificent seat of the Most\nNoble Marquis of Bristol, who had repeatedly assured Harry that he\nmight consider Ickworth his home.\nNow, all these accounts of marquises and Ickworths, and Harry\u2019s having\nbeen hand in glove with so many lords and ladies, began to breed some\nsuspicions concerning the rigid morality of my friend, as a teller of\nthe truth. But, after all, thought I to myself, who can prove that\nHarry has fibbed? Certainly, his manners are polished, he has a mighty\neasy address; and there is nothing altogether impossible about his\nhaving consorted with the master of Ickworth, and the daughter of the\nanonymous earl. And what right has a poor Yankee, like me, to insinuate\nthe slightest suspicion against what he says? What little money he has,\nhe spends freely; he can not be a polite blackleg, for I am no pigeon\nto pluck; so _that_ is out of the question;\u2014perish such a thought,\nconcerning my own bosom friend!\nBut though I drowned all my suspicions as well as I could, and ever\ncherished toward Harry a heart, loving and true; yet, spite of all\nthis, I never could entirely digest some of his imperial reminiscences\nof high life. I was very sorry for this; as at times it made me feel\nill at ease in his company; and made me hold back my whole soul from\nhim; when, in its loneliness, it was yearning to throw itself into the\nunbounded bosom of some immaculate friend.\nCHAPTER XLV.\nHARRY BOLTON KIDNAPS REDBURN, AND CARRIES HIM OFF TO LONDON\nIt might have been a week after our glimpse of Lord Lovely, that Harry,\nwho had been expecting a letter, which, he told me, might possibly\nalter his plans, one afternoon came bounding on board the ship, and\nsprang down the hatchway into the _between-decks,_ where, in perfect\nsolitude, I was engaged picking oakum; at which business the mate had\nset me, for want of any thing better.\n\u201cHey for London, Wellingborough!\u201d he cried. \u201cOff tomorrow! first\ntrain\u2014be there the same night\u2014come! I have money to rig you all\nout\u2014drop that hangman\u2019s stuff there, and away! Pah! how it smells here!\nCome; up you jump!\u201d\nI trembled with amazement and delight.\nLondon? it could not be!\u2014and Harry\u2014how kind of him! he was then indeed\nwhat he seemed. But instantly I thought of all the circumstances of the\ncase, and was eager to know what it was that had induced this sudden\ndeparture.\nIn reply my friend told me, that he had received a remittance, and had\nhopes of recovering a considerable sum, lost in some way that he chose\nto conceal.\n\u201cBut how am I to leave the ship, Harry?\u201d said I; \u201cthey will not let me\ngo, will they? You had better leave me behind, after all; I don\u2019t care\nvery much about going; and besides, I have no money to share the\nexpenses.\u201d\nThis I said, only pretending indifference, for my heart was jumping all\nthe time.\n\u201cTut! my Yankee bantam,\u201d said Harry; \u201clook here!\u201d and he showed me a\nhandful of gold.\n\u201cBut they are _yours,_ and not _mine,_ Harry,\u201d said I.\n\u201cYours _and_ mine, my sweet fellow,\u201d exclaimed Harry. \u201cCome, sink the\nship, and let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t consider, if I quit the ship, they\u2019ll be sending a\nconstable after me, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cWhat! and do you think, then, they value your services so highly? Ha!\nha!-Up, up, Wellingborough: I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\nTrue enough. I well knew that Captain Riga would not trouble himself\nmuch, if I _did_ take French leave of him. So, without further thought\nof the matter, I told Harry to wait a few moments, till the ship\u2019s bell\nstruck four; at which time I used to go to supper, and be free for the\nrest of the day.\nThe bell struck; and off we went. As we hurried across the quay, and\nalong the dock walls, I asked Harry all about his intentions. He said,\nthat go to London he must, and to Bury St. Edmunds; but that whether he\nshould for any time remain at either place, he could not now tell; and\nit was by no means impossible, that in less than a week\u2019s time we would\nbe back again in Liverpool, and ready for sea. But all he said was\nenveloped in a mystery that I did not much like; and I hardly know\nwhether I have repeated correctly what he said at the time.\nArrived at the _Golden Anchor,_ where Harry put up, he at once led me\nto his room, and began turning over the contents of his chest, to see\nwhat clothing he might have, that would fit me.\nThough he was some years my senior, we were about the same size\u2014if any\nthing, I was larger than he; so, with a little stretching, a shirt,\nvest, and pantaloons were soon found to suit. As for a coat and hat,\nthose Harry ran out and bought without delay; returning with a loose,\nstylish sack-coat, and a sort of foraging cap, very neat, genteel, and\nunpretending.\nMy friend himself soon doffed his Guernsey frock, and stood before me,\narrayed in a perfectly plain suit, which he had bought on purpose that\nvery morning. I asked him why he had gone to that unnecessary expense,\nwhen he had plenty of other clothes in his chest. But he only winked,\nand looked knowing. This, again, I did not like. But I strove to drown\nugly thoughts.\nTill quite dark, we sat talking together; when, locking his chest, and\ncharging his landlady to look after it well, till he called, or sent\nfor it; Harry seized my arm, and we sallied into the street.\nPursuing our way through crowds of frolicking sailors and fiddlers, we\nturned into a street leading to the Exchange. There, under the shadow\nof the colonnade, Harry told me to stop, while he left me, and went to\nfinish his toilet. Wondering what he meant, I stood to one side; and\npresently was joined by a stranger in whiskers and mustache.\n\u201cIt\u2019s _me\u201d_ said the stranger; and who was _me_ but Harry, who had thus\nmetamorphosed himself? I asked him the reason; and in a faltering\nvoice, which I tried to make humorous, expressed a hope that he was not\ngoing to turn gentleman forger.\nHe laughed, and assured me that it was only a precaution against being\nrecognized by his own particular friends in London, that he had adopted\nthis mode of disguising himself.\n\u201cAnd why afraid of your friends?\u201d asked I, in astonishment, \u201cand we are\nnot in London yet.\u201d\n\u201cPshaw! what a Yankee you are, Wellingborough. Can\u2019t you see very\nplainly that I have a plan in my head? And this disguise is only for a\nshort time, you know. But I\u2019ll tell you all by and by.\u201d\nI acquiesced, though not feeling at ease; and we walked on, till we\ncame to a public house, in the vicinity of the place at which the cars\nare taken.\nWe stopped there that night, and next day were off, whirled along\nthrough boundless landscapes of villages, and meadows, and parks: and\nover arching viaducts, and through wonderful tunnels; till, half\ndelirious with excitement, I found myself dropped down in the evening\namong gas-lights, under a great roof in Euston Square.\nLondon at last, and in the West-End!\nCHAPTER XLVI.\nA MYSTERIOUS NIGHT IN LONDON\n\u201cNo time to lose,\u201d said Harry, \u201ccome along.\u201d\nHe called a cab: in an undertone mentioned the number of a house in\nsome street to the driver; we jumped in, and were off.\nAs we rattled over the boisterous pavements, past splendid squares,\nchurches, and shops, our cabman turning corners like a skater on the\nice, and all the roar of London in my ears, and no end to the walls of\nbrick and mortar; I thought New York a hamlet, and Liverpool a\ncoal-hole, and myself somebody else: so unreal seemed every thing about\nme. My head was spinning round like a top, and my eyes ached with much\ngazing; particularly about the corners, owing to my darting them so\nrapidly, first this side, and then that, so as not to miss any thing;\nthough, in truth, I missed much.\n\u201cStop,\u201d cried Harry, after a long while, putting his head out of the\nwindow, all at once\u2014\u201cstop! do you hear, you deaf man? you have passed\nthe house\u2014No. 40 I told you\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014the high steps there, with the\npurple light!\u201d\nThe cabman being paid, Harry adjusting his whiskers and mustache, and\nbidding me assume a lounging look, pushed his hat a little to one side,\nand then locking arms, we sauntered into the house; myself feeling not\na little abashed; it was so long since I had been in any courtly\nsociety.\nIt was some semi-public place of opulent entertainment; and far\nsurpassed any thing of the kind I had ever seen before.\nThe floor was tesselated with snow-white, and russet-hued marbles; and\nechoed to the tread, as if all the Paris catacombs were underneath. I\nstarted with misgivings at that hollow, boding sound, which seemed\nsighing with a subterraneous despair, through all the magnificent\nspectacle around me; mocking it, where most it glared.\nThe walls were painted so as to deceive the eye with interminable\ncolonnades; and groups of columns of the finest Scagliola work of\nvariegated marbles\u2014emerald-green and gold, St. Pons veined with silver,\nSienna with porphyry\u2014supported a resplendent fresco ceiling, arched\nlike a bower, and thickly clustering with mimic grapes. Through all the\nEast of this foliage, you spied in a crimson dawn, Guide\u2019s ever\nyouthful Apollo, driving forth the horses of the sun. From sculptured\nstalactites of vine-boughs, here and there pendent hung galaxies of gas\nlights, whose vivid glare was softened by pale, cream-colored,\nporcelain spheres, shedding over the place a serene, silver flood; as\nif every porcelain sphere were a moon; and this superb apartment was\nthe moon-lit garden of Portia at Belmont; and the gentle lovers,\nLorenzo and Jessica, lurked somewhere among the vines.\nAt numerous Moorish looking tables, supported by Caryatides of turbaned\nslaves, sat knots of gentlemanly men, with cut decanters and\ntaper-waisted glasses, journals and cigars, before them.\nTo and fro ran obsequious waiters, with spotless napkins thrown over\ntheir arms, and making a profound salaam, and hemming deferentially,\nwhenever they uttered a word.\nAt the further end of this brilliant apartment, was a rich mahogany\nturret-like structure, partly built into the wall, and communicating\nwith rooms in the rear. Behind, was a very handsome florid old man,\nwith snow-white hair and whiskers, and in a snow-white jacket\u2014he looked\nlike an almond tree in blossom\u2014who seemed to be standing, a polite\nsentry over the scene before him; and it was he, who mostly ordered\nabout the waiters; and with a silent salute, received the silver of the\nguests.\nOur entrance excited little or no notice; for every body present seemed\nexceedingly animated about concerns of their own; and a large group was\ngathered around one tall, military looking gentleman, who was reading\nsome India war-news from the Times, and commenting on it, in a very\nloud voice, condemning, in toto, the entire campaign.\nWe seated ourselves apart from this group, and Harry, rapping on the\ntable, called for wine; mentioning some curious foreign name.\nThe decanter, filled with a pale yellow wine, being placed before us,\nand my comrade having drunk a few glasses; he whispered me to remain\nwhere I was, while he withdrew for a moment.\nI saw him advance to the turret-like place, and exchange a confidential\nword with the almond tree there, who immediately looked very much\nsurprised,\u2014I thought, a little disconcerted,\u2014and then disappeared with\nhim.\nWhile my friend was gone, I occupied myself with looking around me, and\nstriving to appear as indifferent as possible, and as much used to all\nthis splendor as if I had been born in it. But, to tell the truth, my\nhead was almost dizzy with the strangeness of the sight, and the\nthought that I was really in London. What would my brother have said?\nWhat would Tom Legare, the treasurer of the Juvenile Temperance\nSociety, have thought?\nBut I almost began to fancy I had no friends and relatives living in a\nlittle village three thousand five hundred miles off, in America; for\nit was hard to unite such a humble reminiscence with the splendid\nanimation of the London-like scene around me.\nAnd in the delirium of the moment, I began to indulge in foolish golden\nvisions of the counts and countesses to whom Harry might introduce me;\nand every instant I expected to hear the waiters addressing some\ngentleman as _\u201cMy Lord,\u201d_ or _\u201cfour Grace.\u201d_ But if there were really\nany lords present, the waiters omitted their titles, at least in my\nhearing.\nMixed with these thoughts were confused visions of St. Paul\u2019s and the\nStrand, which I determined to visit the very next morning, before\nbreakfast, or perish in the attempt. And I even longed for Harry\u2019s\nreturn, that we might immediately sally out into the street, and see\nsome of the sights, before the shops were all closed for the night.\nWhile I thus sat alone, I observed one of the waiters eying me a little\nimpertinently, as I thought, and as if he saw something queer about me.\nSo I tried to assume a careless and lordly air, and by way of helping\nthe thing, threw one leg over the other, like a young Prince Esterhazy;\nbut all the time I felt my face burning with embarrassment, and for the\ntime, I must have looked very guilty of something. But spite of this, I\nkept looking boldly out of my eyes, and straight through my blushes,\nand observed that every now and then little parties were made up among\nthe gentlemen, and they retired into the rear of the house, as if going\nto a private apartment. And I overheard one of them drop the word\n_Rouge;_ but he could not have used rouge, for his face was exceedingly\npale. Another said something about _Loo._\nAt last Harry came back, his face rather flushed.\n\u201cCome along, Redburn,\u201d said he.\nSo making no doubt we were off for a ramble, perhaps to Apsley House,\nin the Park, to get a sly peep at the old Duke before he retired for\nthe night, for Harry had told me the Duke always went to bed early, I\nsprang up to follow him; but what was my disappointment and surprise,\nwhen he only led me into the passage, toward a staircase lighted by\nthree marble Graces, unitedly holding a broad candelabra, like an elk\u2019s\nantlers, over the landing.\nWe rambled up the long, winding slope of those aristocratic stairs,\nevery step of which, covered with Turkey rugs, looked gorgeous as the\nhammer-cloth of the Lord Mayor\u2019s coach; and Harry hied straight to a\nrosewood door, which, on magical hinges, sprang softly open to his\ntouch.\nAs we entered the room, methought I was slowly sinking in some\nreluctant, sedgy sea; so thick and elastic the Persian carpeting,\nmimicking parterres of tulips, and roses, and jonquils, like a bower in\nBabylon.\nLong lounges lay carelessly disposed, whose fine damask was interwoven,\nlike the Gobelin tapestry, with pictorial tales of tilt and tourney.\nAnd oriental ottomans, whose cunning warp and woof were wrought into\nplaited serpents, undulating beneath beds of leaves, from which, here\nand there, they flashed out sudden splendors of green scales and gold.\nIn the broad bay windows, as the hollows of King Charles\u2019 oaks, were\nLaocoon-like chairs, in the antique taste, draped with heavy fringes of\nbullion and silk.\nThe walls, covered with a sort of tartan-French paper, variegated with\nbars of velvet, were hung round with mythological oil-paintings,\nsuspended by tasseled cords of twisted silver and blue.\nThey were such pictures as the high-priests, for a bribe, showed to\nAlexander in the innermost shrine of the white temple in the Libyan\noasis: such pictures as the pontiff of the sun strove to hide from\nCortez, when, sword in hand, he burst open the sanctorum of the\npyramid-fane at Cholula: such pictures as you may still see, perhaps,\nin the central alcove of the excavated mansion of Pansa, in Pompeii\u2014in\nthat part of it called by Varro _the hollow of the house:_ such\npictures as Martial and Seutonius mention as being found in the private\ncabinet of the Emperor Tiberius: such pictures as are delineated on the\nbronze medals, to this day dug up on the ancient island of Capreas:\nsuch pictures as you might have beheld in an arched recess, leading\nfrom the left hand of the secret side-gallery of the temple of\nAphrodite in Corinth.\nIn the principal pier was a marble bracket, sculptured in the semblance\nof a dragon\u2019s crest, and supporting a bust, most wonderful to behold.\nIt was that of a bald-headed old man, with a mysteriously-wicked\nexpression, and imposing silence by one thin finger over his lips. His\nmarble mouth seemed tremulous with secrets.\n\u201cSit down, Wellingborough,\u201d said Harry; \u201cdon\u2019t be frightened, we are at\nhome.\u2014Ring the bell, will you? But stop;\u201d\u2014 and advancing to the\nmysterious bust, he whispered something in its ear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a knowing mute, Wellingborough,\u201d said he; \u201cwho stays in this one\nplace all the time, while he is yet running of errands. But mind you\ndon\u2019t breathe any secrets in his ear.\u201d\nIn obedience to a summons so singularly conveyed, to my amazement a\nservant almost instantly appeared, standing transfixed in the attitude\nof a bow.\n\u201cCigars,\u201d said Harry. When they came, he drew up a small table into the\nmiddle of the room, and lighting his cigar, bade me follow his example,\nand make myself happy.\nAlmost transported with such princely quarters, so undreamed of before,\nwhile leading my dog\u2019s life in the filthy forecastle of the Highlander,\nI twirled round a chair, and seated myself opposite my friend.\nBut all the time, I felt ill at heart; and was filled with an\nundercurrent of dismal forebodings. But I strove to dispel them; and\nturning to my companion, exclaimed, \u201cAnd pray, do you live here, Harry,\nin this Palace of Aladdin?\u201d\n\u201cUpon my soul,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou have hit it:\u2014you must have been here\nbefore! Aladdin\u2019s Palace! Why, Wellingborough, it goes by that very\nname.\u201d\nThen he laughed strangely: and for the first time, I thought he had\nbeen quaffing too freely: yet, though he looked wildly from his eyes,\nhis general carriage was firm.\n\u201cWho are you looking at so hard, Wellingborough?\u201d said he.\n\u201cI am afraid, Harry,\u201d said I, \u201cthat when you left me just now, you must\nhave been drinking something stronger than wine.\u201d\n\u201cHear him now,\u201d said Harry, turning round, as if addressing the\nbald-headed bust on the bracket,\u2014\u201ca parson \u2019pon honor!\u2014But remark you,\nWellingborough, my boy, I must leave you again, and for a considerably\nlonger time than before:\u2014I may not be back again to-night.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said I.\n\u201cBe still,\u201d he cried, \u201chear me, I know the old duke here, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWho? not the Duke of Wellington,\u201d said I, wondering whether Harry was\nreally going to include _him_ too, in his long list of confidential\nfriends and acquaintances.\n\u201cPooh!\u201d cried Harry, \u201cI mean the white-whiskered old man you saw below;\nthey call him _the Duke:\u2014he_ keeps the house. I say, I know him well,\nand he knows _me;_ and he knows what brings me here, also. Well; we\nhave arranged every thing about you; you are to stay in this room, and\nsleep here tonight, and\u2014and\u2014\u201d continued he, speaking low\u2014\u201cyou must\nguard this letter\u2014\u201d slipping a sealed one into my hand\u2014\u201cand, if I am\nnot back by morning, you must post right on to Bury, and leave the\nletter there;\u2014here, take this paper\u2014it\u2019s all set down here in black and\nwhite\u2014where you are to go, and what you are to do. And after that\u2019s\ndone\u2014mind, this is all in case I don\u2019t return\u2014then you may do what you\nplease: stay here in London awhile, or go back to Liverpool. And here\u2019s\nenough to pay all your expenses.\u201d\nAll this was a thunder stroke. I thought Harry was crazy. I held the\npurse in my motionless hand, and stared at him, till the tears almost\nstarted from my eyes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Redburn?\u201d he cried, with a wild sort of laugh\u2014\u201cyou\nare not afraid of me, are you?\u2014No, no! I believe in you, my boy, or you\nwould not hold that purse in your hand; no, nor that letter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name do you mean?\u201d at last I exclaimed, \u201cyou don\u2019t\nreally intend to desert me in this strange place, do you, Harry?\u201d and I\nsnatched him by the hand.\n\u201cPooh, pooh,\u201d he cried, \u201clet me go. I tell you, it\u2019s all right: do as I\nsay: that\u2019s all. Promise me now, will you? Swear it!\u2014no, no,\u201d he added,\nvehemently, as I conjured him to tell me more\u2014\u201cno, I won\u2019t: I have\nnothing more to tell you\u2014not a word. Will you swear?\u201d\n\u201cBut one sentence more for your own sake, Harry: hear me!\u201d\n\u201cNot a syllable! Will you swear?\u2014you will not? then here, give me that\npurse:\u2014there\u2014there\u2014take that\u2014and that\u2014and that;\u2014that will pay your fare\nback to Liverpool; good-by to you: you are not my friend,\u201d and he\nwheeled round his back.\nI know not what flashed through my mind, but something suddenly\nimpelled me; and grasping his hand, I swore to him what he demanded.\nImmediately he ran to the bust, whispered a word, and the\nwhite-whiskered old man appeared: whom he clapped on the shoulder, and\nthen introduced me as his friend\u2014young Lord Stormont; and bade the\nalmond tree look well to the comforts of his lordship, while\nhe\u2014Harry\u2014was gone.\nThe almond tree blandly bowed, and grimaced, with a peculiar\nexpression, that I hated on the spot. After a few words more, he\nwithdrew. Harry then shook my hand heartily, and without giving me a\nchance to say one word, seized his cap, and darted out of the room,\nsaying, \u201cLeave not this room tonight; and remember the letter, and\nBury!\u201d\nI fell into a chair, and gazed round at the strange-looking walls and\nmysterious pictures, and up to the chandelier at the ceiling; then\nrose, and opened the door, and looked down the lighted passage; but\nonly heard the hum from the roomful below, scattered voices, and a\nhushed ivory rattling from the closed apartments adjoining. I stepped\nback into the room, and a terrible revulsion came over me: I would have\ngiven the world had I been safe back in Liverpool, fast asleep in my\nold bunk in Prince\u2019s Dock.\nI shuddered at every footfall, and almost thought it must be some\nassassin pursuing me. The whole place seemed infected; and a strange\nthought came over me, that in the very damasks around, some eastern\nplague had been imported. And was that pale yellow wine, that I drank\nbelow, drugged? thought I. This must be some house whose foundations\ntake hold on the pit. But these fearful reveries only enchanted me fast\nto my chair; so that, though I then wished to rush forth from the\nhouse, my limbs seemed manacled.\nWhile thus chained to my seat, something seemed suddenly flung open; a\nconfused sound of imprecations, mixed with the ivory rattling, louder\nthan before, burst upon my ear, and through the partly open door of the\nroom where I was, I caught sight of a tall, frantic man, with clenched\nhands, wildly darting through the passage, toward the stairs.\nAnd all the while, Harry ran through my soul\u2014in and out, at every door,\nthat burst open to his vehement rush.\nAt that moment my whole acquaintance with him passed like lightning\nthrough my mind, till I asked myself why he had come here, to London,\nto do this thing?\u2014why would not Liverpool have answered? and what did\nhe want of me? But, every way, his conduct was unaccountable. From the\nhour he had accosted me on board the ship, his manner seemed gradually\nchanged; and from the moment we had sprung into the cab, he had seemed\nalmost another person from what he had seemed before.\nBut what could I do? He was gone, that was certain;\u2014would he ever come\nback? But he might still be somewhere in the house; and with a shudder,\nI thought of that ivory rattling, and was almost ready to dart forth,\nsearch every room, and save him. But that would be madness, and I had\nsworn not to do so. There seemed nothing left, but to await his return.\nYet, if he did not return, what then? I took out the purse, and counted\nover the money, and looked at the letter and paper of memoranda.\nThough I vividly remember it all, I will not give the superscription of\nthe letter, nor the contents of the paper. But after I had looked at\nthem attentively, and considered that Harry could have no conceivable\nobject in deceiving me, I thought to myself, Yes, he\u2019s in earnest; and\nhere I am\u2014yes, even in London! And here in this room will I stay, come\nwhat will. I will implicitly follow his directions, and so see out the\nlast of this thing.\nBut spite of these thoughts, and spite of the metropolitan magnificence\naround me, I was mysteriously alive to a dreadful feeling, which I had\nnever before felt, except when penetrating into the lowest and most\nsqualid haunts of sailor iniquity in Liverpool. All the mirrors and\nmarbles around me seemed crawling over with lizards; and I thought to\nmyself, that though gilded and golden, the serpent of vice is a serpent\nstill.\nIt was now grown very late; and faint with excitement, I threw myself\nupon a lounge; but for some time tossed about restless, in a sort of\nnight-mare. Every few moments, spite of my oath, I was upon the point\nof starting up, and rushing into the street, to inquire where I was;\nbut remembering Harry\u2019s injunctions, and my own ignorance of the town,\nand that it was now so late, I again tried to be composed.\nAt last, I fell asleep, dreaming about Harry fighting a duel of\ndice-boxes with the military-looking man below; and the next thing I\nknew, was the glare of a light before my eyes, and Harry himself, very\npale, stood before me.\n\u201cThe letter and paper,\u201d he cried.\nI fumbled in my pockets, and handed them to him.\n\u201cThere! there! there! thus I tear you,\u201d he cried, wrenching the letter\nto pieces with both hands like a madman, and stamping upon the\nfragments. \u201cI am off for America; the game is up.\u201d\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake explain,\u201d said I, now utterly bewildered, and\nfrightened. \u201cTell me, Harry, what is it? You have not been gambling?\u201d\n\u201cHa, ha,\u201d he deliriously laughed. \u201cGambling? red and white, you\nmean?\u2014cards?\u2014dice?\u2014the bones?\u2014Ha, ha!\u2014Gambling? gambling?\u201d he ground\nout between his teeth\u2014\u201cwhat two devilish, stiletto-sounding syllables\nthey are!\u201d\n\u201cWellingborough,\u201d he added, marching up to me slowly, but with his eyes\nblazing into mine\u2014\u201cWellingborough\u201d\u2014and fumbling in his breast-pocket,\nhe drew forth a dirk\u2014\u201cHere, Wellingborough, take it\u2014take it, I say\u2014are\nyou stupid?\u2014there, there\u201d\u2014and he pushed it into my hands. \u201cKeep it away\nfrom me\u2014keep it out of my sight\u2014I don\u2019t want it near me, while I feel\nas I do. They serve suicides scurvily here, Wellingborough; they don\u2019t\nbury them decently. See that bell-rope! By Heaven, it\u2019s an invitation\nto hang myself\"\u2014and seizing it by the gilded handle at the end, he\ntwitched it down from the wall.\n\u201cIn God\u2019s name, what ails you?\u201d I cried.\n\u201cNothing, oh nothing,\u201d said Harry, now assuming a treacherous, tropical\ncalmness\u2014\u201cnothing, Redburn; nothing in the world. I\u2019m the serenest of\nmen.\u201d\n\u201cBut give me that dirk,\u201d he suddenly cried\u2014\u201clet me have it, I say. Oh!\nI don\u2019t mean to murder myself\u2014I\u2019m past that now\u2014give it me\u201d\u2014and\nsnatching it from my hand, he flung down an empty purse, and with a\nterrific stab, nailed it fast with the dirk to the table.\n\u201cThere now,\u201d he cried, \u201cthere\u2019s something for the old duke to see\nto-morrow morning; that\u2019s about all that\u2019s left of me\u2014 that\u2019s my\nskeleton, Wellingborough. But come, don\u2019t be downhearted; there\u2019s a\nlittle more gold yet in Golconda; I have a guinea or two left. Don\u2019t\nstare so, my boy; we shall be in Liverpool to-morrow night; we start in\nthe morning\u201d\u2014and turning his back, he began to whistle very fiercely.\n\u201cAnd this, then,\u201d said I, \u201cis your showing me London, is it, Harry? I\ndid not think this; but tell me your secret, whatever it is, and I will\nnot regret not seeing the town.\u201d\nHe turned round upon me like lightning, and cried, \u201cRed-burn! you must\nswear another oath, and instantly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d said I, in alarm, \u201cwhat more would you have me swear?\u201d\n\u201cNever to question me again about this infernal trip to London!\u201d he\nshouted, with the foam at his lips\u2014\u201cnever to breathe it! swear!\u201d\n\u201cI certainly shall not trouble you, Harry, with questions, if you do\nnot desire it,\u201d said I, \u201cbut there\u2019s no need of swearing.\u201d\n\u201cSwear it, I say, as you love me, Redburn,\u201d he added, imploringly.\n\u201cWell, then, I solemnly do. Now lie down, and let us forget ourselves\nas soon as we can; for me, you have made me the most miserable dog\nalive.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what am I?\u201d cried Harry; \u201cbut pardon me, Redburn, I did not mean\nto offend; if you knew all\u2014but no, no!\u2014never mind, never mind!\u201d And he\nran to the bust, and whispered in its ear. A waiter came.\n\u201cBrandy,\u201d whispered Harry, with clenched teeth.\n\u201cAre you not going to sleep, then?\u201d said I, more and more alarmed at\nhis wildness, and fearful of the effects of his drinking still more, in\nsuch a mood.\n\u201cNo sleep for me! sleep if _you_ can\u2014I mean to sit up with a\ndecanter!\u2014let me see\u201d\u2014looking at the ormolu clock on the mantel\u2014\u201cit\u2019s\nonly two hours to morning.\u201d\nThe waiter, looking very sleepy, and with a green shade on his brow,\nappeared with the decanter and glasses on a salver, and was told to\nleave it and depart.\nSeeing that Harry was not to be moved, I once more threw myself on the\nlounge. I did not sleep; but, like a somnambulist, only dozed now and\nthen; starting from my dreams; while Harry sat, with his hat on, at the\ntable; the brandy before him; from which he occasionally poured into\nhis glass. Instead of exciting him, however, to my amazement, the\nspirits seemed to soothe him down; and, ere long, he was comparatively\ncalm.\nAt last, just as I had fallen into a deep sleep, I was wakened by his\nshaking me, and saying our cab was at the door.\n\u201cLook! it is broad day,\u201d said he, brushing aside the heavy hangings of\nthe window.\nWe left the room; and passing through the now silent and deserted hall\nof pillars, which, at this hour, reeked as with blended roses and\ncigar-stumps decayed; a dumb waiter; rubbing his eyes, flung open the\nstreet door; we sprang into the cab; and soon found ourselves whirled\nalong northward by railroad, toward Prince\u2019s Dock and the Highlander.\nCHAPTER XLVII.\nHOMEWARD BOUND\nOnce more in Liverpool; and wending my way through the same old streets\nto the sign of the Golden Anchor; I could scarcely credit the events of\nthe last thirty-six hours.\nSo unforeseen had been our departure in the first place; so rapid our\njourney; so unaccountable the conduct of Harry; and so sudden our\nreturn; that all united to overwhelm me. That I had been at all in\nLondon seemed impossible; and that I had been there, and come away\nlittle the wiser, was almost distracting to one who, like me, had so\nlonged to behold that metropolis of marvels.\nI looked hard at Harry as he walked in silence at my side; I stared at\nthe houses we passed; I thought of the cab, the gas lighted hall in the\nPalace of Aladdin, the pictures, the letter, the oath, the dirk; the\nmysterious place where all these mysteries had occurred; and then, was\nalmost ready to conclude, that the pale yellow wine had been drugged.\nAs for Harry, stuffing his false whiskers and mustache into his pocket,\nhe now led the way to the boarding-house; and saluting the landlady,\nwas shown to his room; where we immediately shifted our clothes,\nappearing once more in our sailor habiliments.\n\u201cWell, what do you propose to do now, Harry?\u201d said I, with a heavy\nheart.\n\u201cWhy, visit your Yankee land in the Highlander, of course\u2014what else?\"\nhe replied.\n\u201cAnd is it to be a visit, or a long stay?\u201d asked I.\n\u201cThat\u2019s as it may turn out,\u201d said Harry; \u201cbut I have now more than ever\nresolved upon the sea. There is nothing like the sea for a fellow like\nme, Redburn; a desperate man can not get any further than the wharf,\nyou know; and the next step must be a long jump. But come, let\u2019s see\nwhat they have to eat here, and then for a cigar and a stroll. I feel\nbetter already. Never say die, is my motto.\u201d\nWe went to supper; after that, sallied out; and walking along the quay\nof Prince\u2019s Dock, heard that the ship Highlander had that morning been\nadvertised to sail in two days\u2019 time.\n\u201cGood!\u201d exclaimed Harry; and I was glad enough myself.\nAlthough I had now been absent from the ship a full forty-eight hours,\nand intended to return to her, yet I did not anticipate being called to\nany severe account for it from the officers; for several of our men had\nabsented themselves longer than I had, and upon their return, little or\nnothing was said to them. Indeed, in some cases, the mate seemed to\nknow nothing about it. During the whole time we lay in Liverpool, the\ndiscipline of the ship was altogether relaxed; and I could hardly\nbelieve they were the same officers who were so dictatorial at sea. The\nreason of this was, that we had nothing important to do; and although\nthe captain might now legally refuse to receive me on board, yet I was\nnot afraid of that, as I was as stout a lad for my years, and worked as\ncheap, as any one he could engage to take my place on the homeward\npassage.\nNext morning we made our appearance on board before the rest of the\ncrew; and the mate perceiving me, said with an oath, \u201cWell, sir, you\nhave thought best to return then, have you? Captain Riga and I were\nflattering ourselves that you had made a run of it for good.\u201d\nThen, thought I, the captain, who seems to affect to know nothing of\nthe proceedings of the sailors, has been aware of my absence.\n\u201cBut turn to, sir, turn to,\u201d added the mate; \u201chere! aloft there, and\nfree that pennant; it\u2019s foul of the backstay\u2014jump!\u201d\nThe captain coming on board soon after, looked very benevolently at\nHarry; but, as usual, pretended not to take the slightest notice of\nmyself.\nWe were all now very busy in getting things ready for sea. The cargo\nhad been already stowed in the hold by the stevedores and lumpers from\nshore; but it became the crew\u2019s business to clear away the\n_between-decks,_ extending from the cabin bulkhead to the forecastle,\nfor the reception of about five hundred emigrants, some of whose boxes\nwere already littering the decks.\nTo provide for their wants, a far larger supply of water was needed\nthan upon the outward-bound passage. Accordingly, besides the usual\nnumber of casks on deck, rows of immense tierces were lashed\namid-ships, all along the _between-decks,_ forming a sort of aisle on\neach side, furnishing access to four rows of bunks,\u2014three tiers, one\nabove another,\u2014against the ship\u2019s sides; two tiers being placed over\nthe tierces of water in the middle. These bunks were rapidly knocked\ntogether with coarse planks. They looked more like dog-kennels than any\nthing else; especially as the place was so gloomy and dark; no light\ncoming down except through the fore and after hatchways, both of which\nwere covered with little houses called _\u201cbooby-hatches.\u201d_ Upon the\nmain-hatches, which were well calked and covered over with heavy\ntarpaulins, the _\u201cpassengers-galley\u201d_ was solidly lashed down.\nThis _galley_ was a large open stove, or iron range\u2014made expressly for\nemigrant ships, wholly unprotected from the weather, and where alone\nthe emigrants are permitted to cook their food while at sea.\nAfter two days\u2019 work, every thing was in readiness; most of the\nemigrants on board; and in the evening we worked the ship close into\nthe outlet of Prince\u2019s Dock, with the bow against the water-gate, to go\nout with the tide in the morning.\nIn the morning, the bustle and confusion about us was indescribable.\nAdded to the ordinary clamor of the docks, was the hurrying to and fro\nof our five hundred emigrants, the last of whom, with their baggage,\nwere now coming on board; the appearance of the cabin passengers,\nfollowing porters with their trunks; the loud orders of the\ndock-masters, ordering the various ships behind us to preserve their\norder of going out; the leave-takings, and good-by\u2019s, and\nGod-bless-you\u2019s, between the emigrants and their friends; and the\ncheers of the surrounding ships.\nAt this time we lay in such a way, that no one could board us except by\nthe bowsprit, which overhung the quay. Staggering along that bowsprit,\nnow came a one-eyed _crimp_ leading a drunken tar by the collar, who\nhad been shipped to sail with us the day previous. It has been stated\nbefore, that two or three of our men had left us for good, while in\nport. When the crimp had got this man and another safely lodged in a\nbunk below, he returned on shore; and going to a miserable cab, pulled\nout still another apparently drunken fellow, who proved completely\nhelpless. However, the ship now swinging her broadside more toward the\nquay, this stupefied sailor, with a Scotch cap pulled down over his\nclosed eyes, only revealing a sallow Portuguese complexion, was lowered\non board by a rope under his arms, and passed forward by the crew, who\nput him likewise into a bunk in the forecastle, the crimp himself\ncarefully tucking him in, and bidding the bystanders not to disturb him\ntill the ship was away from the land.\nThis done, the confusion increased, as we now glided out of the dock.\nHats and handkerchiefs were waved; hurrahs were exchanged; and tears\nwere shed; and the last thing I saw, as we shot into the stream, was a\npoliceman collaring a boy, and walking him off to the guard-house.\nA steam-tug, the _Goliath,_ now took us by the arm, and gallanted us\ndown the river past the fort.\nThe scene was most striking.\nOwing to a strong breeze, which had been blowing up the river for four\ndays past, holding wind-bound in the various docks a multitude of ships\nfor all parts of the world; there was now under weigh, a vast fleet of\nmerchantmen, all steering broad out to sea. The white sails glistened\nin the clear morning air like a great Eastern encampment of sultans;\nand from many a forecastle, came the deep mellow old song _Ho-o-he-yo,\ncheerily men!_ as the crews called their anchors.\nThe wind was fair; the weather mild; the sea most smooth; and the poor\nemigrants were in high spirits at so auspicious a beginning of their\nvoyage. They were reclining all over the decks, talking of soon seeing\nAmerica, and relating how the agent had told them, that twenty days\nwould be an uncommonly long voyage.\nHere it must be mentioned, that owing to the great number of ships\nsailing to the Yankee ports from Liverpool, the competition among them\nin obtaining emigrant passengers, who as a cargo are much more\nremunerative than crates and bales, is exceedingly great; so much so,\nthat some of the agents they employ, do not scruple to deceive the poor\napplicants for passage, with all manner of fables concerning the short\nspace of time, in which their ships make the run across the ocean.\nThis often induces the emigrants to provide a much smaller stock of\nprovisions than they otherwise would; the effect of which sometimes\nproves to be in the last degree lamentable; as will be seen further on.\nAnd though benevolent societies have been long organized in Liverpool,\nfor the purpose of keeping offices, where the emigrants can obtain\nreliable information and advice, concerning their best mode of\nembarkation, and other matters interesting to them; and though the\nEnglish authorities have imposed a law, providing that every captain of\nan emigrant ship bound for any port of America shall see to it, that\neach passenger is provided with rations of food for sixty days; yet,\nall this has not deterred mercenary ship-masters and unprincipled\nagents from practicing the grossest deception; nor exempted the\nemigrants themselves, from the very sufferings intended to be averted.\nNo sooner had we fairly gained the expanse of the Irish Sea, and, one\nby one, lost sight of our thousand consorts, than the weather changed\ninto the most miserable cold, wet, and cheerless days and nights\nimaginable. The wind was tempestuous, and dead in our teeth; and the\nhearts of the emigrants fell. Nearly all of them had now hied below, to\nescape the uncomfortable and perilous decks: and from the two\n_\u201cbooby-hatches\u201d_ came the steady hum of a subterranean wailing and\nweeping. That irresistible wrestler, sea-sickness, had overthrown the\nstoutest of their number, and the women and children were embracing and\nsobbing in all the agonies of the poor emigrant\u2019s first storm at sea.\nBad enough is it at such times with ladies and gentlemen in the cabin,\nwho have nice little state-rooms; and plenty of privacy; and stewards\nto run for them at a word, and put pillows under their heads, and\ntenderly inquire how they are getting along, and mix them a posset: and\neven then, in the abandonment of this soul and body subduing malady,\nsuch ladies and gentlemen will often give up life itself as\nunendurable, and put up the most pressing petitions for a speedy\nannihilation; all of which, however, only arises from their intense\nanxiety to preserve their valuable lives.\nHow, then, with the friendless emigrants, stowed away like bales of\ncotton, and packed like slaves in a slave-ship; confined in a place\nthat, during storm time, must be closed against both light and air; who\ncan do no cooking, nor warm so much as a cup of water; for the\ndrenching seas would instantly flood their fire in their exposed galley\non deck? How, then, with these men, and women, and children, to whom a\nfirst voyage, under the most advantageous circumstances, must come just\nas hard as to the Honorable De Lancey Fitz Clarence, lady, daughter,\nand seventeen servants.\nNor is this all: for in some of these ships, as in the case of the\nHighlander, the emigrant passengers are cut off from the most\nindispensable conveniences of a civilized dwelling. This forces them in\nstorm time to such extremities, that no wonder fevers and plagues are\nthe result. We had not been at sea one week, when to hold your head\ndown the fore hatchway was like holding it down a suddenly opened\ncesspool.\nBut still more than this. Such is the aristocracy maintained on board\nsome of these ships, that the most arbitrary measures are enforced, to\nprevent the emigrants from intruding upon the most holy precincts of\nthe quarter-deck, the only completely open space on ship-board.\nConsequently\u2014even in fine weather\u2014when they come up from below, they\nare crowded in the waist of the ship, and jammed among the boats,\ncasks, and spars; abused by the seamen, and sometimes cuffed by the\nofficers, for unavoidably standing in the way of working the vessel.\nThe cabin-passengers of the Highlander numbered some fifteen in all;\nand to protect this detachment of gentility from the barbarian\nincursions of the _\u201cwild Irish\u201d_ emigrants, ropes were passed\nathwart-ships, by the main-mast, from side to side: which defined the\nboundary line between those who had paid three pounds passage-money,\nfrom those who had paid twenty guineas. And the cabin-passengers\nthemselves were the most urgent in having this regulation maintained.\nLucky would it be for the pretensions of some parvenus, whose souls are\ndeposited at their banker\u2019s, and whose bodies but serve to carry about\npurses, knit of poor men\u2019s heartstrings, if thus easily they could\nprecisely define, ashore, the difference between them and the rest of\nhumanity.\nBut, I, Redburn, am a poor fellow, who have hardly ever known what it\nis to have five silver dollars in my pocket at one time; so, no doubt,\nthis circumstance has something to do with my slight and harmless\nindignation at these things.\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\nA LIVING CORPSE\nIt was destined that our departure from the English strand, should be\nmarked by a tragical event, akin to the sudden end of the suicide,\nwhich had so strongly impressed me on quitting the American shore.\nOf the three newly shipped men, who in a state of intoxication had been\nbrought on board at the dock gates, two were able to be engaged at\ntheir duties, in four or five hours after quitting the pier. But the\nthird man yet lay in his bunk, in the self-same posture in which his\nlimbs had been adjusted by the crimp, who had deposited him there.\nHis name was down on the ship\u2019s papers as Miguel Saveda, and for Miguel\nSaveda the chief mate at last came forward, shouting down the\nforecastle-scuttle, and commanding his instant presence on deck. But\nthe sailors answered for their new comrade; giving the mate to\nunderstand that Miguel was still fast locked in his trance, and could\nnot obey him; when, muttering his usual imprecation, the mate retired\nto the quarterdeck.\nThis was in the first dog-watch, from four to six in the evening. At\nabout three bells, in the next watch, Max the Dutchman, who, like most\nold seamen, was something of a physician in cases of drunkenness,\nrecommended that Miguel\u2019s clothing should be removed, in order that he\nshould lie more comfortably. But Jackson, who would seldom let any\nthing be done in the forecastle that was not proposed by himself,\ncapriciously forbade this proceeding.\nSo the sailor still lay out of sight in his bunk, which was in the\nextreme angle of the forecastle, behind the _bowsprit-bitts_\u2014two stout\ntimbers rooted in the ship\u2019s keel. An hour or two afterward, some of\nthe men observed a strange odor in the forecastle, which was attributed\nto the presence of some dead rat among the hollow spaces in the side\nplanks; for some days before, the forecastle had been smoked out, to\nextirpate the vermin overrunning her. At midnight, the larboard watch,\nto which I belonged, turned out; and instantly as every man waked, he\nexclaimed at the now intolerable smell, supposed to be heightened by\nthe shaking up the bilge-water, from the ship\u2019s rolling.\n\u201cBlast that rat!\u201d cried the Greenlander.\n\u201cHe\u2019s blasted already,\u201d said Jackson, who in his drawers had crossed\nover to the bunk of Miguel. \u201cIt\u2019s a water-rat, shipmates, that\u2019s dead;\nand here he is\u201d\u2014and with that, he dragged forth the sailor\u2019s arm,\nexclaiming, \u201cDead as a timber-head!\u201d\nUpon this the men rushed toward the bunk, Max with the light, which he\nheld to the man\u2019s face.\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not dead,\u201d he cried, as the yellow flame wavered for a moment\nat the seaman\u2019s motionless mouth. But hardly had the words escaped,\nwhen, to the silent horror of all, two threads of greenish fire, like a\nforked tongue, darted out between the lips; and in a moment, the\ncadaverous face was crawled over by a swarm of wormlike flames.\nThe lamp dropped from the hand of Max, and went out; while covered all\nover with spires and sparkles of flame, that faintly crackled in the\nsilence, the uncovered parts of the body burned before us, precisely\nlike phosphorescent shark in a midnight sea.\nThe eyes were open and fixed; the mouth was curled like a scroll, and\nevery lean feature firm as in life; while the whole face, now wound in\ncurls of soft blue flame, wore an aspect of grim defiance, and eternal\ndeath. Prometheus, blasted by fire on the rock.\nOne arm, its red shirt-sleeve rolled up, exposed the man\u2019s name,\ntattooed in vermilion, near the hollow of the middle joint; and as if\nthere was something peculiar in the painted flesh, every vibrating\nletter burned so white, that you might read the flaming name in the\nflickering ground of blue.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that d\u2014d Miguel?\u201d was now shouted down among us from the\nscuttle by the mate, who had just come on deck, and was determined to\nhave every man up that belonged to his watch.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone to the harbor where they never weigh anchor,\u201d coughed\nJackson. \u201cCome you down, sir, and look.\u201d\nThinking that Jackson intended to beard him, the mate sprang down in a\nrage; but recoiled at the burning body as if he had been shot by a\nbullet. \u201cMy God!\u201d he cried, and stood holding fast to the ladder.\n\u201cTake hold of it,\u201d said Jackson, at last, to the Greenlander; \u201cit must\ngo overboard. Don\u2019t stand shaking there, like a dog; take hold of it, I\nsay! But stop\u201d\u2014and smothering it all in the blankets, he pulled it\npartly out of the bunk.\nA few minutes more, and it fell with a bubble among the phosphorescent\nsparkles of the damp night sea, leaving a coruscating wake as it sank.\nThis event thrilled me through and through with unspeakable horror; nor\ndid the conversation of the watch during the next four hours on deck at\nall serve to soothe me.\nBut what most astonished me, and seemed most incredible, was the\ninfernal opinion of Jackson, that the man had been actually dead when\nbrought on board the ship; and that knowingly, and merely for the sake\nof the month\u2019s advance, paid into his hand upon the strength of the\nbill he presented, the body-snatching crimp had knowingly shipped a\ncorpse on board of the Highlander, under the pretense of its being a\nlive body in a drunken trance. And I heard Jackson say, that he had\nknown of such things having been done before. But that a really dead\nbody ever burned in that manner, I can not even yet believe. But the\nsailors seemed familiar with such things; or at least with the stories\nof such things having happened to others.\nFor me, who at that age had never so much as happened to hear of a case\nlike this, of animal combustion, in the horrid mood that came over me,\nI almost thought the burning body was a premonition of the hell of the\nCalvinists, and that Miguel\u2019s earthly end was a foretaste of his\neternal condemnation.\nImmediately after the burial, an iron pot of red coals was placed in\nthe bunk, and in it two handfuls of coffee were roasted. This done, the\nbunk was nailed up, and was never opened again during the voyage; and\nstrict orders were given to the crew not to divulge what had taken\nplace to the emigrants; but to this, they needed no commands.\nAfter the event, no one sailor but Jackson would stay alone in the\nforecastle, by night or by noon; and no more would they laugh or sing,\nor in any way make merry there, but kept all their pleasantries for the\nwatches on deck. All but Jackson: who, while the rest would be sitting\nsilently smoking on their chests, or in their bunks, would look toward\nthe fatal spot, and cough, and laugh, and invoke the dead man with\nincredible scoffs and jeers. He froze my blood, and made my soul stand\nstill.\nCHAPTER XLIX.\nCARLO\nThere was on board our ship, among the emigrant passengers, a\nrich-cheeked, chestnut-haired Italian boy, arrayed in a faded,\nolive-hued velvet jacket, and tattered trowsers rolled up to his knee.\nHe was not above fifteen years of age; but in the twilight pensiveness\nof his full morning eyes, there seemed to sleep experiences so sad and\nvarious, that his days must have seemed to him years. It was not an eye\nlike Harry\u2019s tho\u2019 Harry\u2019s was large and womanly. It shone with a soft\nand spiritual radiance, like a moist star in a tropic sky; and spoke of\nhumility, deep-seated thoughtfulness, yet a careless endurance of all\nthe ills of life.\nThe head was if any thing small; and heaped with thick clusters of\ntendril curls, half overhanging the brows and delicate ears, it somehow\nreminded you of a classic vase, piled up with Falernian foliage.\nFrom the knee downward, the naked leg was beautiful to behold as any\nlady\u2019s arm; so soft and rounded, with infantile ease and grace. His\nwhole figure was free, fine, and indolent; he was such a boy as might\nhave ripened into life in a Neapolitan vineyard; such a boy as gipsies\nsteal in infancy; such a boy as Murillo often painted, when he went\namong the poor and outcast, for subjects wherewith to captivate the\neyes of rank and wealth; such a boy, as only Andalusian beggars are,\nfull of poetry, gushing from every rent.\nCarlo was his name; a poor and friendless son of earth, who had no\nsire; and on life\u2019s ocean was swept along, as spoon-drift in a gale.\nSome months previous, he had landed in Prince\u2019s Dock, with his\nhand-organ, from a Messina vessel; and had walked the streets of\nLiverpool, playing the sunny airs of southern climes, among the\nnorthern fog and drizzle. And now, having laid by enough to pay his\npassage over the Atlantic, he had again embarked, to seek his fortunes\nin America.\nFrom the first, Harry took to the boy.\n\u201cCarlo,\u201d said Harry, \u201chow did you succeed in England?\u201d\nHe was reclining upon an old sail spread on the long-boat; and throwing\nback his soiled but tasseled cap, and caressing one leg like a child,\nhe looked up, and said in his broken English\u2014that seemed like mixing\nthe potent wine of Oporto with some delicious syrup:\u2014said he, \u201cAh! I\nsucceed very well!\u2014for I have tunes for the young and the old, the gay\nand the sad. I have marches for military young men, and love-airs for\nthe ladies, and solemn sounds for the aged. I never draw a crowd, but I\nknow from their faces what airs will best please them; I never stop\nbefore a house, but I judge from its portico for what tune they will\nsoonest toss me some silver. And I ever play sad airs to the merry, and\nmerry airs to the sad; and most always the rich best fancy the sad, and\nthe poor the merry.\u201d\n\u201cBut do you not sometimes meet with cross and crabbed old men,\u201d said\nHarry, \u201cwho would much rather have your room than your music?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sometimes,\u201d said Carlo, playing with his foot, \u201csometimes I do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then, knowing the value of quiet to unquiet men, I suppose you\nnever leave them under a shilling?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d continued the boy, \u201cI love my organ as I do myself, for it is my\nonly friend, poor organ! it sings to me when I am sad, and cheers me;\nand I never play before a house, on purpose to be paid for leaving off,\nnot I; would I, poor organ?\u201d\u2014 looking down the hatchway where it was.\n\u201cNo, that I never have done, and never will do, though I starve; for\nwhen people drive me away, I do not think my organ is to blame, but\nthey themselves are to blame; for such people\u2019s musical pipes are\ncracked, and grown rusted, that no more music can be breathed into\ntheir souls.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Carlo; no music like yours, perhaps,\u201d said Harry, with a laugh.\n\u201cAh! there\u2019s the mistake. Though my organ is as full of melody, as a\nhive is of bees; yet no organ can make music in unmusical breasts; no\nmore than my native winds can, when they breathe upon a harp without\nchords.\u201d\nNext day was a serene and delightful one; and in the evening when the\nvessel was just rippling along impelled by a gentle yet steady breeze,\nand the poor emigrants, relieved from their late sufferings, were\ngathered on deck; Carlo suddenly started up from his lazy reclinings;\nwent below, and, assisted by the emigrants, returned with his organ.\nNow, music is a holy thing, and its instruments, however humble, are to\nbe loved and revered. Whatever has made, or does make, or may make\nmusic, should be held sacred as the golden bridle-bit of the Shah of\nPersia\u2019s horse, and the golden hammer, with which his hoofs are shod.\nMusical instruments should be like the silver tongs, with which the\nhigh-priests tended the Jewish altars\u2014never to be touched by a hand\nprofane. Who would bruise the poorest reed of Pan, though plucked from\na beggar\u2019s hedge, would insult the melodious god himself.\nAnd there is no humble thing with music in it, not a fife, not a\nnegro-fiddle, that is not to be reverenced as much as the grandest\narchitectural organ that ever rolled its flood-tide of harmony down a\ncathedral nave. For even a Jew\u2019s-harp may be so played, as to awaken\nall the fairies that are in us, and make them dance in our souls, as on\na moon-lit sward of violets.\nBut what subtle power is this, residing in but a bit of steel, which\nmight have made a tenpenny nail, that so enters, without knocking, into\nour inmost beings, and shows us all hidden things?\nNot in a spirit of foolish speculation altogether, in no merely\ntranscendental mood, did the glorious Greek of old fancy the human soul\nto be essentially a harmony. And if we grant that theory of Paracelsus\nand Campanella, that every man has four souls within him; then can we\naccount for those banded sounds with silver links, those quartettes of\nmelody, that sometimes sit and sing within us, as if our souls were\nbaronial halls, and our music were made by the hoarest old harpers of\nWales.\nBut look! here is poor Carlo\u2019s organ; and while the silent crowd\nsurrounds him, there he stands, looking mildly but inquiringly about\nhim; his right hand pulling and twitching the ivory knobs at one end of\nhis instrument.\nBehold the organ!\nSurely, if much virtue lurk in the old fiddles of Cremona, and if their\nmelody be in proportion to their antiquity, what divine ravishments may\nwe not anticipate from this venerable, embrowned old organ, which might\nalmost have played the Dead March in Saul, when King Saul himself was\nburied.\nA fine old organ! carved into fantastic old towers, and turrets, and\nbelfries; its architecture seems somewhat of the Gothic, monastic\norder; in front, it looks like the West-Front of York Minster.\nWhat sculptured arches, leading into mysterious intricacies!\u2014what\nmullioned windows, that seem as if they must look into chapels flooded\nwith devotional sunsets!\u2014what flying buttresses, and gable-ends, and\nniches with saints!\u2014But stop! \u2019tis a Moorish iniquity; for here, as I\nlive, is a Saracenic arch; which, for aught I know, may lead into some\ninterior Alhambra.\nAy, it does; for as Carlo now turns his hand, I hear the gush of the\nFountain of Lions, as he plays some thronged Italian air\u2014a mixed and\nliquid sea of sound, that dashes its spray in my face.\nPlay on, play on, Italian boy! what though the notes be broken, here\u2019s\nthat within that mends them. Turn hither your pensive, morning eyes;\nand while I list to the organs twain\u2014 one yours, one mine\u2014let me gaze\nfathoms down into thy fathomless eye;\u2014\u2019tis good as gazing down into the\ngreat South Sea, and seeing the dazzling rays of the dolphins there.\nPlay on, play on! for to every note come trooping, now, triumphant\nstandards, armies marching\u2014all the pomp of sound. Methinks I am Xerxes,\nthe nucleus of the martial neigh of all the Persian studs. Like gilded\ndamask-flies, thick clustering on some lofty bough, my satraps swarm\naround me.\nBut now the pageant passes, and I droop; while Carlo taps his ivory\nknobs; and plays some flute-like saraband\u2014soft, dulcet, dropping\nsounds, like silver cans in bubbling brooks. And now a clanging,\nmartial air, as if ten thousand brazen trumpets, forged from spurs and\nswordhilts, called North, and South, and East, to rush to West!\nAgain\u2014what blasted heath is this?\u2014what goblin sounds of Macbeth\u2019s\nwitches?\u2014Beethoven\u2019s Spirit Waltz! the muster-call of sprites and\nspecters. Now come, hands joined, Medusa, Hecate, she of Endor, and all\nthe Blocksberg\u2019s, demons dire.\nOnce more the ivory knobs are tapped; and long-drawn, golden sounds are\nheard\u2014some ode to Cleopatra; slowly loom, and solemnly expand, vast,\nrounding orbs of beauty; and before me float innumerable queens, deep\ndipped in silver gauzes.\nAll this could Carlo do\u2014make, unmake me; build me up; to pieces take\nme; and join me limb to limb. He is the architect of domes of sound,\nand bowers of song.\nAnd all is done with that old organ! Reverenced, then, be all street\norgans; more melody is at the beck of my Italian boy, than lurks in\nsquadrons of Parisian orchestras.\nBut look! Carlo has that to feast the eye as well as ear; and the same\nwondrous magic in me, magnifies them into grandeur; though every figure\ngreatly needs the artist\u2019s repairing hand, and sadly needs a dusting.\nHis York Minster\u2019s West-Front opens; and like the gates of Milton\u2019s\nheaven, it turns on golden hinges.\nWhat have we here? The inner palace of the Great Mogul? Group and\ngilded columns, in confidential clusters; fixed fountains; canopies and\nlounges; and lords and dames in silk and spangles.\nThe organ plays a stately march; and presto! wide open arches; and out\ncome, two and two, with nodding plumes, in crimson turbans, a troop of\nmartial men; with jingling scimiters, they pace the hall; salute, pass\non, and disappear.\nNow, ground and lofty tumblers; jet black Nubian slaves. They fling\nthemselves on poles; stand on their heads; and downward vanish.\nAnd now a dance and masquerade of figures, reeling from the side-doors,\namong the knights and dames. Some sultan leads a sultaness; some\nemperor, a queen; and jeweled sword-hilts of carpet knights fling back\nthe glances tossed by coquettes of countesses.\nOn this, the curtain drops; and there the poor old organ stands,\nbegrimed, and black, and rickety.\nNow, tell me, Carlo, if at street corners, for a single penny, I may\nthus transport myself in dreams Elysian, who so rich as I? Not he who\nowns a million.\nAnd Carlo! ill betide the voice that ever greets thee, my Italian boy,\nwith aught but kindness; cursed the slave who ever drives thy wondrous\nbox of sights and sounds forth from a lordling\u2019s door!\nCHAPTER L.\nHARRY BOLTON AT SEA\nAs yet I have said nothing about how my friend, Harry, got along as a\nsailor.\nPoor Harry! a feeling of sadness, never to be comforted, comes over me,\neven now when I think of you. For this voyage that you went, but\ncarried you part of the way to that ocean grave, which has buried you\nup with your secrets, and whither no mourning pilgrimage can be made.\nBut why this gloom at the thought of the dead? And why should we not be\nglad? Is it, that we ever think of them as departed from all joy? Is\nit, that we believe that indeed they are dead? They revisit us not, the\ndeparted; their voices no more ring in the air; summer may come, but it\nis winter with them; and even in our own limbs we feel not the sap that\nevery spring renews the green life of the trees.\nBut Harry! you live over again, as I recall your image before me. I see\nyou, plain and palpable as in life; and can make your existence obvious\nto others. Is he, then, dead, of whom this may be said?\nBut Harry! you are mixed with a thousand strange forms, the centaurs of\nfancy; half real and human, half wild and grotesque. Divine imaginings,\nlike gods, come down to the groves of our Thessalies, and there, in the\nembrace of wild, dryad reminiscences, beget the beings that astonish\nthe world.\nBut Harry! though your image now roams in my Thessaly groves, it is the\nsame as of old; and among the droves of mixed beings and centaurs, you\nshow like a zebra, banding with elks.\nAnd indeed, in his striped Guernsey frock, dark glossy skin and hair,\nHarry Bolton, mingling with the Highlander\u2019s crew, looked not unlike\nthe soft, silken quadruped-creole, that, pursued by wild Bushmen,\nbounds through Caffrarian woods.\nHow they hunted you, Harry, my zebra! those ocean barbarians, those\nunimpressible, uncivilized sailors of ours! How they pursued you from\nbowsprit to mainmast, and started you out of your every retreat!\nBefore the day of our sailing, it was known to the seamen that the\ngirlish youth, whom they daily saw near the sign of the Clipper in\nUnion-street, would form one of their homeward-bound crew. Accordingly,\nthey cast upon him many a critical glance; but were not long in\nconcluding that Harry would prove no very great accession to their\nstrength; that the hoist of so tender an arm would not tell many\nhundred-weight on the maintop-sail halyards. Therefore they disliked\nhim before they became acquainted with him; and such dislikes, as every\none knows, are the most inveterate, and liable to increase. But even\nsailors are not blind to the sacredness that hallows a stranger; and\nfor a time, abstaining from rudeness, they only maintained toward my\nfriend a cold and unsympathizing civility.\nAs for Harry, at first the novelty of the scene filled up his mind; and\nthe thought of being bound for a distant land, carried with it, as with\nevery one, a buoyant feeling of undefinable expectation. And though his\nmoney was now gone again, all but a sovereign or two, yet that troubled\nhim but little, in the first flush of being at sea.\nBut I was surprised, that one who had certainly seen much of life,\nshould evince such an incredible ignorance of what was wholly\ninadmissible in a person situated as he was. But perhaps his\nfamiliarity with lofty life, only the less qualified him for\nunderstanding the other extreme. Will you believe me, this Bury blade\nonce came on deck in a brocaded dressing-gown, embroidered slippers,\nand tasseled smoking-cap, to stand his morning watch.\nAs soon as I beheld him thus arrayed, a suspicion, which had previously\ncrossed my mind, again recurred, and I almost vowed to myself that,\nspite his protestations, Harry Bolton never could have been at sea\nbefore, even as a _Guinea-pig_ in an Indiaman; for the slightest\nacquaintance with the sea-life and sailors, should have prevented him,\nit would seem, from enacting this folly.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that Chinese mandarin?\u201d cried the mate, who had made voyages to\nCanton. \u201cLook you, my fine fellow, douse that mainsail now, and furl it\nin a trice.\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry, starting back. \u201cIs not this the morning watch, and\nis not mine a morning gown?\u201d\nBut though, in my refined friend\u2019s estimation, nothing could be more\nappropriate; in the mate\u2019s, it was the most monstrous of incongruities;\nand the offensive gown and cap were removed.\n\u201cIt is too bad!\u201d exclaimed Harry to me; \u201cI meant to lounge away the\nwatch in that gown until coffee time;\u2014and I suppose your Hottentot of a\nmate won\u2019t permit a gentleman to smoke his Turkish pipe of a morning;\nbut by gad, I\u2019ll wear straps to my pantaloons to spite him!\u201d\nOh! that was the rock on which you split, poor Harry! Incensed at the\nwant of polite refinement in the mates and crew, Harry, in a pet and\npique, only determined to provoke them the more; and the storm of\nindignation he raised very soon overwhelmed him.\nThe sailors took a special spite to his chest, a large mahogany one,\nwhich he had had made to order at a furniture warehouse. It was\nornamented with brass screw-heads, and other devices; and was well\nfilled with those articles of the wardrobe in which Harry had sported\nthrough a London season; for the various vests and pantaloons he had\nsold in Liverpool, when in want of money, had not materially lessened\nhis extensive stock.\nIt was curious to listen to the various hints and opinings thrown out\nby the sailors at the occasional glimpses they had of this collection\nof silks, velvets, broadcloths, and satins. I do not know exactly what\nthey thought Harry had been; but they seemed unanimous in believing\nthat, by abandoning his country, Harry had left more room for the\ngamblers. Jackson even asked him to lift up the lower hem of his\nbrowsers, to test the color of his calves.\nIt is a noteworthy circumstance, that whenever a slender made youth, of\neasy manners and polite address happens to form one of a ship\u2019s\ncompany, the sailors almost invariably impute his sea-going to an\nirresistible necessity of decamping from terra-firma in order to evade\nthe constables.\nThese white-fingered gentry must be light-fingered too, they say to\nthemselves, or they would not be after putting their hands into our\ntar. What else can bring them to sea?\nCogent and conclusive this; and thus Harry, from the very beginning,\nwas put down for a very equivocal character.\nSometimes, however, they only made sport of his appearance; especially\none evening, when his monkey jacket being wet through, he was obliged\nto mount one of his swallow-tailed coats. They said he carried two\nmizzen-peaks at his stern; declared he was a broken-down quill-driver,\nor a footman to a Portuguese running barber, or some old maid\u2019s\ntobacco-boy. As for the captain, it had become all the same to Harry as\nif there were no gentlemanly and complaisant Captain Riga on board. For\nto his no small astonishment,\u2014but just as I had predicted,\u2014Captain Riga\nnever noticed him now, but left the business of indoctrinating him into\nthe little experiences of a greenhorn\u2019s career solely in the hands of\nhis officers and crew.\nBut the worst was to come. For the first few days, whenever there was\nany running aloft to be done, I noticed that Harry was indefatigable in\ncoiling away the slack of the rigging about decks; ignoring the fact\nthat his shipmates were springing into the shrouds. And when all hands\nof the watch would be engaged _clewing up a t\u2019-gallant-sail,_ that is,\npulling the proper ropes on deck that wrapped the sail up on the yard\naloft, Harry would always manage to get near the _belaying-pin, so_\nthat when the time came for two of us to spring into the rigging, he\nwould be inordinately fidgety in making fast the _clew-lines,_ and\nwould be so absorbed in that occupation, and would so elaborate the\nhitchings round the pin, that it was quite impossible for him, after\ndoing so much, to mount over the bulwarks before his comrades had got\nthere. However, after securing the clew-lines beyond a possibility of\ntheir getting loose, Harry would always make a feint of starting in a\nprodigious hurry for the shrouds; but suddenly looking up, and seeing\nothers in advance, would retreat, apparently quite chagrined that he\nhad been cut off from the opportunity of signalizing his activity.\nAt this I was surprised, and spoke to my friend; when the alarming fact\nwas confessed, that he had made a private trial of it, and it never\nwould do: _he could not go aloft;_ his nerves would not hear of it.\n\u201cThen, Harry,\u201d said I, \u201cbetter you had never been born. Do you know\nwhat it is that you are coming to? Did you not tell me that you made no\ndoubt you would acquit yourself well in the rigging? Did you not say\nthat you had been two voyages to Bombay? Harry, you were mad to ship.\nBut you only imagine it: try again; and my word for it, you will very\nsoon find yourself as much at home among the spars as a bird in a\ntree.\u201d\nBut he could not be induced to try it over again; the fact was, _his\nnerves could not stand it;_ in the course of his courtly career, he had\ndrunk too much strong Mocha coffee and gunpowder tea, and had smoked\naltogether too many Havannas.\nAt last, as I had repeatedly warned him, the mate singled him out one\nmorning, and commanded him to mount to the main-truck, and unreeve the\nshort signal halyards.\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry, aghast.\n\u201cAway you go!\u201d said the mate, snatching a whip\u2019s end.\n\u201cDon\u2019t strike me!\u201d screamed Harry, drawing himself up.\n\u201cTake that, and along with you,\u201d cried the mate, laying the rope once\nacross his back, but lightly.\n\u201cBy heaven!\u201d cried Harry, wincing\u2014not with the blow, but the insult:\nand then making a dash at the mate, who, holding out his long arm, kept\nhim lazily at bay, and laughed at him, till, had I not feared a broken\nhead, I should infallibly have pitched my boy\u2019s bulk into the officer.\n\u201cCaptain Riga!\u201d cried Harry.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call upon _him\u201d_ said the mate; \u201che\u2019s asleep, and won\u2019t wake up\ntill we strike Yankee soundings again. Up you go!\u201d he added,\nflourishing the rope\u2019s end.\nHarry looked round among the grinning tars with a glance of terrible\nindignation and agony; and then settling his eye on me, and seeing\nthere no hope, but even an admonition of obedience, as his only\nresource, he made one bound into the rigging, and was up at the\nmain-top in a trice. I thought a few more springs would take him to the\ntruck, and was a little fearful that in his desperation he might then\njump overboard; for I had heard of delirious greenhorns doing such\nthings at sea, and being lost forever. But no; he stopped short, and\nlooked down from the top. Fatal glance! it unstrung his every fiber;\nand I saw him reel, and clutch the shrouds, till the mate shouted out\nfor him not to squeeze the tar out of the ropes. \u201cUp you go, sir.\u201d But\nHarry said nothing.\n\u201cYou Max,\u201d cried the mate to the Dutch sailor, \u201cspring after him, and\nhelp him; you understand?\u201d\nMax went up the rigging hand over hand, and brought his red head with a\nbump against the base of Harry\u2019s back. Needs must when the devil\ndrives; and higher and higher, with Max bumping him at every step, went\nmy unfortunate friend. At last he gained the royal yard, and the thin\nsignal halyards\u2014, hardly bigger than common twine\u2014were flying in the\nwind. \u201cUnreeve!\u201d cried the mate.\nI saw Harry\u2019s arm stretched out\u2014his legs seemed shaking in the rigging,\neven to us, down on deck; and at last, thank heaven! the deed was done.\nHe came down pale as death, with bloodshot eyes, and every limb\nquivering. From that moment he never put foot in rattlin; never mounted\nabove the bulwarks; and for the residue of the voyage, at least, became\nan altered person.\nAt the time, he went to the mate\u2014since he could not get speech of the\ncaptain\u2014and conjured him to intercede with Riga, that his name might be\nstricken off from the list of the ship\u2019s company, so that he might make\nthe voyage as a steerage passenger; for which privilege, he bound\nhimself to pay, as soon as he could dispose of some things of his in\nNew York, over and above the ordinary passage-money. But the mate gave\nhim a blunt denial; and a look of wonder at his effrontery. Once a\nsailor on board a ship, and _always_ a sailor for that voyage, at\nleast; for within so brief a period, no officer can bear to associate\non terms of any thing like equality with a person whom he has ordered\nabout at his pleasure.\nHarry then told the mate solemnly, that he might do what he pleased,\nbut go aloft again he _could_ not, and _would_ not. He would do any\nthing else but that.\nThis affair sealed Harry\u2019s fate on board of the Highlander; the crew\nnow reckoned him fair play for their worst jibes and jeers, and he led\na miserable life indeed.\nFew landsmen can imagine the depressing and self-humiliating effects of\nfinding one\u2019s self, for the first time, at the beck of illiterate\nsea-tyrants, with no opportunity of exhibiting any trait about you, but\nyour ignorance of every thing connected with the sea-life that you\nlead, and the duties you are constantly called upon to perform. In such\na sphere, and under such circumstances, Isaac Newton and Lord Bacon\nwould be sea-clowns and bumpkins; and Napoleon Bonaparte be cuffed and\nkicked without remorse. In more than one instance I have seen the truth\nof this; and Harry, poor Harry, proved no exception. And from the\ncircumstances which exempted me from experiencing the bitterest of\nthese evils, I only the more felt for one who, from a strange\nconstitutional nervousness, before unknown even to himself, was become\nas a hunted hare to the merciless crew.\nBut how was it that Harry Bolton, who spite of his effeminacy of\nappearance, had evinced, in our London trip, such unmistakable flashes\nof a spirit not easily tamed\u2014how was it, that he could now yield\nhimself up to the almost passive reception of contumely and contempt?\nPerhaps his spirit, for the time, had been broken. But I will not\nundertake to explain; we are curious creatures, as every one knows; and\nthere are passages in the lives of all men, so out of keeping with the\ncommon tenor of their ways, and so seemingly contradictory of\nthemselves, that only He who made us can expound them.\nCHAPTER LI.\nTHE EMIGRANTS\nAfter the first miserable weather we experienced at sea, we had\nintervals of foul and fair, mostly the former, however, attended with\nhead winds, till at last, after a three days\u2019 fog and rain, the sun\nrose cheerily one morning, and showed us Cape Clear. Thank heaven, we\nwere out of the weather emphatically called _\u201cChannel weather,\u201d_ and\nthe last we should see of the eastern hemisphere was now in plain\nsight, and all the rest was broad ocean.\n_Land ho!_ was cried, as the dark purple headland grew out of the\nnorth. At the cry, the Irish emigrants came rushing up the hatchway,\nthinking America itself was at hand.\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d cried one of them, running out a little way on the\nbowsprit. \u201cIs _that_ it?\u201d\n\u201cAye, it doesn\u2019t look much like _ould_ Ireland, does it?\u201d said Jackson.\n\u201cNot a bit, honey:\u2014and how long before we get there? to-night?\u201d\nNothing could exceed the disappointment and grief of the emigrants,\nwhen they were at last informed, that the land to the north was their\nown native island, which, after leaving three or four weeks previous in\na steamboat for Liverpool, was now close to them again; and that, after\nnewly voyaging so many days from the Mersey, the Highlander was only\nbringing them in view of the original home whence they started.\nThey were the most simple people I had ever seen. They seemed to have\nno adequate idea of distances; and to them, America must have seemed as\na place just over a river. Every morning some of them came on deck, to\nsee how much nearer we were: and one old man would stand for hours\ntogether, looking straight off from the bows, as if he expected to see\nNew York city every minute, when, perhaps, we were yet two thousand\nmiles distant, and steering, moreover, against a head wind.\nThe only thing that ever diverted this poor old man from his earnest\nsearch for land, was the occasional appearance of porpoises under the\nbows; when he would cry out at the top of his voice\u2014\u201cLook, look, ye\ndivils! look at the great pigs of the sea!\u201d\nAt last, the emigrants began to think, that the ship had played them\nfalse; and that she was bound for the East Indies, or some other remote\nplace; and one night, Jackson set a report going among them, that Riga\npurposed taking them to Barbary, and selling them all for slaves; but\nthough some of the old women almost believed it, and a great weeping\nensued among the children, yet the men knew better than to believe such\na ridiculous tale.\nOf all the emigrants, my Italian boy Carlo, seemed most at his ease. He\nwould lie all day in a dreamy mood, sunning himself in the long boat,\nand gazing out on the sea. At night, he would bring up his organ, and\nplay for several hours; much to the delight of his fellow voyagers, who\nblessed him and his organ again and again; and paid him for his music\nby furnishing him his meals. Sometimes, the steward would come forward,\nwhen it happened to be very much of a moonlight, with a message from\nthe cabin, for Carlo to repair to the quarterdeck, and entertain the\ngentlemen and ladies.\nThere was a fiddler on board, as will presently be seen; and sometimes,\nby urgent entreaties, he was induced to unite his music with Carlo\u2019s,\nfor the benefit of the cabin occupants; but this was only twice or\nthrice: for this fiddler deemed himself considerably elevated above the\nother steerage-passengers; and did not much fancy the idea of fiddling\nto strangers; and thus wear out his elbow, while persons, entirely\nunknown to him, and in whose welfare he felt not the slightest\ninterest, were curveting about in famous high spirits. So for the most\npart, the gentlemen and ladies were fain to dance as well as they could\nto my little Italian\u2019s organ.\nIt was the most accommodating organ in the world; for it could play any\ntune that was called for; Carlo pulling in and out the ivory knobs at\none side, and so manufacturing melody at pleasure.\nTrue, some censorious gentlemen cabin-passengers protested, that such\nor such an air, was not precisely according to Handel or Mozart; and\nsome ladies, whom I overheard talking about throwing their nosegays to\nMalibran at Covent Garden, assured the attentive Captain Riga, that\nCarlo\u2019s organ was a most wretched affair, and made a horrible din.\n\u201cYes, ladies,\u201d said the captain, bowing, \u201cby your leave, I think\nCarlo\u2019s organ must have lost its mother, for it squeals like a pig\nrunning after its dam.\u201d\nHarry was incensed at these criticisms; and yet these cabin-people were\nall ready enough to dance to poor Carlo\u2019s music.\n\u201cCarlo\u201d\u2014said I, one night, as he was marching forward from the\nquarter-deck, after one of these sea-quadrilles, which took place\nduring my watch on deck:\u2014\u201cCarlo\u201d\u2014said I, \u201cwhat do the gentlemen and\nladies give you for playing?\u201d\n\u201cLook!\u201d\u2014and he showed me three copper medals of Britannia and her\nshield\u2014three English pennies.\nNow, whenever we discover a dislike in us, toward any one, we should\never be a little suspicious of ourselves. It may be, therefore, that\nthe natural antipathy with which almost all seamen and\nsteerage-passengers, regard the inmates of the cabin, was one cause at\nleast, of my not feeling very charitably disposed toward them, myself.\nYes: that might have been; but nevertheless, I will let nature have her\nown way for once; and here declare roundly, that, however it was, I\ncherished a feeling toward these cabin-passengers, akin to contempt.\nNot because they happened to be cabin-passengers: not at all: but only\nbecause they seemed the most finical, miserly, mean men and women, that\never stepped over the Atlantic.\nOne of them was an old fellow in a robust looking coat, with broad\nskirts; he had a nose like a bottle of port-wine; and would stand for a\nwhole hour, with his legs straddling apart, and his hands deep down in\nhis breeches pockets, as if he had two mints at work there, coining\nguineas. He was an abominable looking old fellow, with cold, fat,\njelly-like eyes; and avarice, heartlessness, and sensuality stamped all\nover him. He seemed all the time going through some process of mental\narithmetic; doing sums with dollars and cents: his very mouth, wrinkled\nand drawn up at the corners, looked like a purse. When he dies, his\nskull ought to be turned into a savings box, with the till-hole between\nhis teeth.\nAnother of the cabin inmates, was a middle-aged Londoner, in a comical\nCockney-cut coat, with a pair of semicircular tails: so that he looked\nas if he were sitting in a swing. He wore a spotted neckerchief; a\nshort, little, fiery-red vest; and striped pants, very thin in the\ncalf, but very full about the waist. There was nothing describable\nabout him but his dress; for he had such a meaningless face, I can not\nremember it; though I have a vague impression, that it looked at the\ntime, as if its owner was laboring under the mumps.\nThen there were two or three buckish looking young fellows, among the\nrest; who were all the time playing at cards on the poop, under the lee\nof the _spanker;_ or smoking cigars on the taffrail; or sat quizzing\nthe emigrant women with opera-glasses, leveled through the windows of\nthe upper cabin. These sparks frequently called for the steward to help\nthem to brandy and water, and talked about going on to Washington, to\nsee Niagara Falls.\nThere was also an old gentleman, who had brought with him three or four\nheavy files of the _London Times,_ and other papers; and he spent all\nhis hours in reading them, on the shady side of the deck, with one leg\ncrossed over the other; and without crossed legs, he never read at all.\nThat was indispensable to the proper understanding of what he studied.\nHe growled terribly, when disturbed by the sailors, who now and then\nwere obliged to move him to get at the ropes.\nAs for the ladies, I have nothing to say concerning them; for ladies\nare like creeds; if you can not speak well of them, say nothing.\nCHAPTER LII.\nTHE EMIGRANTS\u2019 KITCHEN\nI have made some mention of the \u201cgalley,\u201d or great stove for the\nsteerage passengers, which was planted over the main hatches.\nDuring the outward-bound passage, there were so few occupants of the\nsteerage, that they had abundant room to do their cooking at this\ngalley. But it was otherwise now; for we had four or five hundred in\nthe steerage; and all their cooking was to be done by one fire; a\npretty large one, to be sure, but, nevertheless, small enough,\nconsidering the number to be accommodated, and the fact that the fire\nwas only to be kindled at certain hours.\nFor the emigrants in these ships are under a sort of martial-law; and\nin all their affairs are regulated by the despotic ordinances of the\ncaptain. And though it is evident, that to a certain extent this is\nnecessary, and even indispensable; yet, as at sea no appeal lies beyond\nthe captain, he too often makes unscrupulous use of his power. And as\nfor going to law with him at the end of the voyage, you might as well\ngo to law with the Czar of Russia.\nAt making the fire, the emigrants take turns; as it is often very\ndisagreeable work, owing to the pitching of the ship, and the heaving\nof the spray over the uncovered \u201cgalley.\u201d Whenever I had the morning\nwatch, from four to eight, I was sure to see some poor fellow crawling\nup from below about daybreak, and go to groping over the deck after\nbits of rope-yarn, or tarred canvas, for kindling-stuff. And no sooner\nwould the fire be fairly made, than up came the old women, and men, and\nchildren; each armed with an iron pot or saucepan; and invariably a\ngreat tumult ensued, as to whose turn to cook came next; sometimes the\nmore quarrelsome would fight, and upset each other\u2019s pots and pans.\nOnce, an English lad came up with a little coffee-pot, which he managed\nto crowd in between two pans. This done, he went below. Soon after a\ngreat strapping Irishman, in knee-breeches and bare calves, made his\nappearance; and eying the row of things on the fire, asked whose\ncoffee-pot that was; upon being told, he removed it, and put his own in\nits place; saying something about that individual place belonging to\nhim; and with that, he turned aside.\nNot long after, the boy came along again; and seeing his pot removed,\nmade a violent exclamation, and replaced it; which the Irishman no\nsooner perceived, than he rushed at him, with his fists doubled. The\nboy snatched up the boiling coffee, and spirted its contents all about\nthe fellow\u2019s bare legs; which incontinently began to dance involuntary\nhornpipes and fandangoes, as a preliminary to giving chase to the boy,\nwho by this time, however, had decamped.\nMany similar scenes occurred every day; nor did a single day pass, but\nscores of the poor people got no chance whatever to do their cooking.\nThis was bad enough; but it was a still more miserable thing, to see\nthese poor emigrants wrangling and fighting together for the want of\nthe most ordinary accommodations. But thus it is, that the very\nhardships to which such beings are subjected, instead of uniting them,\nonly tends, by imbittering their tempers, to set them against each\nother; and thus they themselves drive the strongest rivet into the\nchain, by which their social superiors hold them subject.\nIt was with a most reluctant hand, that every evening in the second\ndog-watch, at the mate\u2019s command, I would march up to the fire, and\ngiving notice to the assembled crowd, that the time was come to\nextinguish it, would dash it out with my bucket of salt water; though\nmany, who had long waited for a chance to cook, had now to go away\ndisappointed.\nThe staple food of the Irish emigrants was oatmeal and water, boiled\ninto what is sometimes called _mush;_ by the Dutch is known as\n_supaan;_ by sailors _burgoo;_ by the New Englanders _hasty-pudding;_\nin which hasty-pudding, by the way, the poet Barlow found the materials\nfor a sort of epic.\nSome of the steerage passengers, however, were provided with\nsea-biscuit, and other perennial food, that was eatable all the year\nround, fire or no fire.\nThere were several, moreover, who seemed better to do in the world than\nthe rest; who were well furnished with hams, cheese, Bologna sausages,\nDutch herrings, alewives, and other delicacies adapted to the\ncontingencies of a voyager in the steerage.\nThere was a little old Englishman on board, who had been a grocer\nashore, whose greasy trunks seemed all pantries; and he was constantly\nusing himself for a cupboard, by transferring their contents into his\nown interior. He was a little light of head, I always thought. He\nparticularly doated on his long strings of sausages; and would\nsometimes take them out, and play with them, wreathing them round him,\nlike an Indian juggler with charmed snakes. What with this diversion,\nand eating his cheese, and helping himself from an inexhaustible junk\nbottle, and smoking his pipe, and meditating, this crack-pated grocer\nmade time jog along with him at a tolerably easy pace.\nBut by far the most considerable man in the steerage, in point of\npecuniary circumstances at least, was a slender little pale-faced\nEnglish tailor, who it seemed had engaged a passage for himself and\nwife in some imaginary section of the ship, called the _second cabin,_\nwhich was feigned to combine the comforts of the first cabin with the\ncheapness of the steerage. But it turned out that this second cabin was\ncomprised in the after part of the steerage itself, with nothing\nintervening but a name. So to his no small disgust, he found himself\nherding with the rabble; and his complaints to the captain were\nunheeded.\nThis luckless tailor was tormented the whole voyage by his wife, who\nwas young and handsome; just such a beauty as farmers\u2019-boys fall in\nlove with; she had bright eyes, and red cheeks, and looked plump and\nhappy.\nShe was a sad coquette; and did not turn away, as she was bound to do,\nfrom the dandy glances of the cabin bucks, who ogled her through their\ndouble-barreled opera glasses. This enraged the tailor past telling; he\nwould remonstrate with his wife, and scold her; and lay his matrimonial\ncommands upon her, to go below instantly, out of sight. But the lady\nwas not to be tyrannized over; and so she told him. Meantime, the bucks\nwould be still framing her in their lenses, mightily enjoying the fun.\nThe last resources of the poor tailor would be, to start up, and make a\ndash at the rogues, with clenched fists; but upon getting as far as the\nmainmast, the mate would accost him from over the rope that divided\nthem, and beg leave to communicate the fact, that he could come no\nfurther. This unfortunate tailor was also a fiddler; and when fairly\nbaited into desperation, would rush for his instrument, and try to get\nrid of his wrath by playing the most savage, remorseless airs he could\nthink of.\nWhile thus employed, perhaps his wife would accost him\u2014\n\u201cBilly, my dear;\u201d and lay her soft hand on his shoulder.\nBut Billy, he only fiddled harder.\n\u201cBilly, my love!\u201d\nThe bow went faster and faster.\n\u201cCome, now, Billy, my dear little fellow, let\u2019s make it all up;\u201d and\nshe bent over his knees, looking bewitchingly up at him, with her\nirresistible eyes.\nDown went fiddle and bow; and the couple would sit together for an hour\nor two, as pleasant and affectionate as possible.\nBut the next day, the chances were, that the old feud would be renewed,\nwhich was certain to be the case at the first glimpse of an opera-glass\nfrom the cabin.\nCHAPTER LIII.\nTHE HORATII AND CURIATII\nWith a slight alteration, I might begin this chapter after the manner\nof Livy, in the 24th section of his first book:\u2014\u201cIt _happened, that in\neach family were three twin brothers, between whom there was little\ndisparity in point of age or of strength.\u201d_\nAmong the steerage passengers of the Highlander, were two women from\nArmagh, in Ireland, widows and sisters, who had each three twin sons,\nborn, as they said, on the same day.\nThey were ten years old. Each three of these six cousins were as like\nas the mutually reflected figures in a kaleidoscope; and like the forms\nseen in a kaleidoscope, together, as well as separately, they seemed to\nform a complete figure. But, though besides this fraternal likeness,\nall six boys bore a strong cousin-german resemblance to each other;\nyet, the O\u2019Briens were in disposition quite the reverse of the\nO\u2019Regans. The former were a timid, silent trio, who used to revolve\naround their mother\u2019s waist, and seldom quit the maternal orbit;\nwhereas, the O\u2019Regans were \u201cbroths of boys,\u201d full of mischief and fun,\nand given to all manner of devilment, like the tails of the comets.\nEarly every morning, Mrs. O\u2019Regan emerged from the steerage, driving\nher spirited twins before her, like a riotous herd of young steers; and\nmade her way to the capacious deck-tub, full of salt water, pumped up\nfrom the sea, for the purpose of washing down the ship. Three splashes,\nand the three boys were ducking and diving together in the brine; their\nmother engaged in _shampooing_ them, though it was haphazard sort of\nwork enough; a rub here, and a scrub there, as she could manage to\nfasten on a stray limb.\n\u201cPat, ye divil, hould still while I wash ye. Ah! but it\u2019s you, Teddy,\nyou rogue. Arrah, now, Mike, ye spalpeen, don\u2019t be mixing your legs up\nwith Pat\u2019s.\u201d\nThe little rascals, leaping and scrambling with delight, enjoyed the\nsport mightily; while this indefatigable, but merry matron, manipulated\nthem all over, as if it were a matter of conscience.\nMeanwhile, Mrs. O\u2019Brien would be standing on the boatswain\u2019s locker\u2014or\nrope and tar-pot pantry in the vessel\u2019s bows\u2014with a large old quarto\nBible, black with age, laid before her between the knight-heads, and\nreading aloud to her three meek little lambs.\nThe sailors took much pleasure in the deck-tub performances of the\nO\u2019Regans, and greatly admired them always for their archness and\nactivity; but the tranquil O\u2019Briens they did not fancy so much. More\nespecially they disliked the grave matron herself; hooded in rusty\nblack; and they had a bitter grudge against her book. To that, and the\nincantations muttered over it, they ascribed the head winds that\nhaunted us; and Blunt, our Irish cockney, really believed that Mrs.\nO\u2019Brien purposely came on deck every morning, in order to secure a foul\nwind for the next ensuing twenty-four hours.\nAt last, upon her coming forward one morning, Max the Dutchman accosted\nher, saying he was sorry for it, but if she went between the\nknight-heads again with her book, the crew would throw it overboard for\nher.\nNow, although contrasted in character, there existed a great warmth of\naffection between the two families of twins, which upon this occasion\nwas curiously manifested.\nNotwithstanding the rebuke and threat of the sailor, the widow silently\noccupied her old place; and with her children clustering round her,\nbegan her low, muttered reading, standing right in the extreme bows of\nthe ship, and slightly leaning over them, as if addressing the\nmultitudinous waves from a floating pulpit. Presently Max came behind\nher, snatched the book from her hands, and threw it overboard. The\nwidow gave a wail, and her boys set up a cry. Their cousins, then\nducking in the water close by, at once saw the cause of the cry; and\nspringing from the tub, like so many dogs, seized Max by the legs,\nbiting and striking at him: which, the before timid little O\u2019Briens no\nsooner perceived, than they, too, threw themselves on the enemy, and\nthe amazed seaman found himself baited like a bull by all six boys.\nAnd here it gives me joy to record one good thing on the part of the\nmate. He saw the fray, and its beginning; and rushing forward, told Max\nthat he would harm the boys at his peril; while he cheered them on, as\nif rejoiced at their giving the fellow such a tussle. At last Max,\nsorely scratched, bit, pinched, and every way aggravated, though of\ncourse without a serious bruise, cried out \u201cenough!\u201d and the assailants\nwere ordered to quit him; but though the three O\u2019Briens obeyed, the\nthree O\u2019Regans hung on to him like leeches, and had to be dragged off.\n\u201cThere now, you rascal,\u201d cried the mate, \u201cthrow overboard another\nBible, and I\u2019ll send you after it without a bowline.\u201d\nThis event gave additional celebrity to the twins throughout the\nvessel. That morning all six were invited to the quarter-deck, and\nreviewed by the cabin-passengers, the ladies manifesting particular\ninterest in them, as they always do concerning twins, which some of\nthem show in public parks and gardens, by stopping to look at them, and\nquestioning their nurses.\n\u201cAnd were you all born at one time?\u201d asked an old lady, letting her eye\nrun in wonder along the even file of white heads.\n\u201cIndeed, an\u2019 we were,\u201d said Teddy; \u201cwasn\u2019t we, mother?\u201d\nMany more questions were asked and answered, when a collection was\ntaken up for their benefit among these magnanimous cabin-passengers,\nwhich resulted in starting all six boys in the world with a penny\napiece.\nI never could look at these little fellows without an inexplicable\nfeeling coming over me; and though there was nothing so very remarkable\nor unprecedented about them, except the singular coincidence of two\nsisters simultaneously making the world such a generous present; yet,\nthe mere fact of there being twins always seemed curious; in fact, to\nme at least, all twins are prodigies; and still I hardly know why this\nshould be; for all of us in our own persons furnish numerous examples\nof the same phenomenon. Are not our thumbs twins? A regular Castor and\nPollux? And all of our fingers? Are not our arms, hands, legs, feet,\neyes, ears, all twins; born at one birth, and as much alike as they\npossibly can be?\nCan it be, that the Greek grammarians invented their dual number for\nthe particular benefit of twins?\nCHAPTER LIV.\nSOME SUPERIOR OLD NAIL-ROD AND _PIG-TAIL_\nIt has been mentioned how advantageously my shipmates disposed of their\ntobacco in Liverpool; but it is to be related how those nefarious\ncommercial speculations of theirs reduced them to sad extremities in\nthe end.\nTrue to their improvident character, and seduced by the high prices\npaid for the weed in England, they had there sold off by far the\ngreater portion of what tobacco they had; even inducing the mate to\nsurrender the portion he had secured under lock and key by command of\nthe Custom-house officers. So that when the crew were about two weeks\nout, on the homeward-bound passage, it became sorrowfully evident that\ntobacco was at a premium.\nNow, one of the favorite pursuits of sailors during a dogwatch below at\nsea is cards; and though they do not understand whist, cribbage, and\ngames of that kidney, yet they are adepts at what is called\n_\u201cHigh-low-Jack-and-the-game,\u201d_ which name, indeed, has a Jackish and\nnautical flavor. Their stakes are generally so many plugs of tobacco,\nwhich, like rouleaux of guineas, are piled on their chests when they\nplay. Judge, then, the wicked zest with which the Highlander\u2019s crew now\nshuffled and dealt the pack; and how the interest curiously and\ninvertedly increased, as the stakes necessarily became less and less;\nand finally resolved themselves into _\u201cchaws.\u201d_\nSo absorbed, at last, did they become at this business, that some of\nthem, after being hard at work during a nightwatch on deck, would rob\nthemselves of rest below, in order to have a brush at the cards. And as\nit is very difficult sleeping in the presence of gamblers; especially\nif they chance to be sailors, whose conversation at all times is apt to\nbe boisterous; these fellows would often be driven out of the\nforecastle by those who desired to rest. They were obliged to repair on\ndeck, and make a card-table of it; and invariably, in such cases, there\nwas a great deal of contention, a great many ungentlemanly charges of\nnigging and cheating; and, now and then, a few parenthetical blows were\nexchanged.\nBut this was not so much to be wondered at, seeing they could see but\nvery little, being provided with no light but that of a midnight sky;\nand the cards, from long wear and rough usage, having become\nexceedingly torn and tarry, so much so, that several members of the\nfour suits might have seceded from their respective clans, and formed\ninto a fifth tribe, under the name of _\u201cTar-spots.\u201d_\nEvery day the tobacco grew scarcer and scarcer; till at last it became\nnecessary to adopt the greatest possible economy in its use. The\nmodicum constituting an ordinary _\u201cchaw,\u201d_ was made to last a whole\nday; and at night, permission being had from the cook, this self-same\n_\u201cchaw\u201d_ was placed in the oven of the stove, and there dried; so as to\ndo duty in a pipe.\nIn the end not a plug was to be had; and deprived of a solace and a\nstimulus, on which sailors so much rely while at sea, the crew became\nabsent, moody, and sadly tormented with the hypos. They were something\nlike opium-smokers, suddenly cut off from their drug. They would sit on\ntheir chests, forlorn and moping; with a steadfast sadness, eying the\nforecastle lamp, at which they had lighted so many a pleasant pipe.\nWith touching eloquence they recalled those happier evenings\u2014the time\nof smoke and vapor; when, after a whole day\u2019s delectable _\u201cchawing,\u201d_\nthey beguiled themselves with their genial, and most companionable\npuffs.\nOne night, when they seemed more than usually cast down and\ndisconsolate, Blunt, the Irish cockney, started up suddenly with an\nidea in his head\u2014\u201cBoys, let\u2019s search under the bunks!\u201d Bless you,\nBlunt! what a happy conceit! Forthwith, the chests were dragged out;\nthe dark places explored; and two sticks of _nail-rod_ tobacco, and\nseveral old _\u201cchaws,\u201d_ thrown aside by sailors on some previous voyage,\nwere their cheering reward. They were impartially divided by Jackson,\nwho, upon this occasion, acquitted himself to the satisfaction of all.\nTheir mode of dividing this tobacco was the rather curious one\ngenerally adopted by sailors, when the highest possible degree of\nimpartiality is desirable. I will describe it, recommending its earnest\nconsideration to all heirs, who may hereafter divide an inheritance;\nfor if they adopted this nautical method, that universally slanderous\naphorism of Lavater would be forever rendered nugatory\u2014\u201cExpect _not to\nunderstand any man till you have divided with him an inheritance.\u201d_\nThe _nail-rods_ they cut as evenly as possible into as many parts as\nthere were men to be supplied; and this operation having been performed\nin the presence of all, Jackson, placing the tobacco before him, his\nface to the wall, and back to the company, struck one of the bits of\nweed with his knife, crying out, \u201cWhose is this?\u201d Whereupon a\nrespondent, previously pitched upon, replied, at a venture, from the\nopposite corner of the forecastle, \u201cBlunt\u2019s;\u201d and to Blunt it went; and\nso on, in like manner, till all were served.\nI put it to you, lawyers\u2014shade of Blackstone, I invoke you\u2014if a more\nimpartial procedure could be imagined than this?\nBut the nail-rods and last-voyage _\u201cchaws\u201d_ were soon gone, and then,\nafter a short interval of comparative gayety, the men again drooped,\nand relapsed into gloom.\nThey soon hit upon an ingenious device, however\u2014but not altogether new\namong seamen\u2014to allay the severity of the depression under which they\nlanguished. Ropes were unstranded, and the yarns picked apart; and, cut\nup into small bits, were used as a substitute for the weed. Old ropes\nwere preferred; especially those which had long lain in the hold, and\nhad contracted an epicurean dampness, making still richer their\nancient, cheese-like flavor.\nIn the middle of most large ropes, there is a straight, central part,\nround which the exterior strands are twisted. When in picking oakum,\nupon various occasions, I have chanced, among the old junk used at such\ntimes, to light upon a fragment of this species of rope, I have ever\ntaken, I know not what kind of strange, nutty delight in untwisting it\nslowly, and gradually coming upon its deftly hidden and aromatic\n_\u201cheart;\u201d_ for so this central piece is denominated.\nIt is generally of a rich, tawny, Indian hue, somewhat inclined to\nluster; is exceedingly agreeable to the touch; diffuses a pungent odor,\nas of an old dusty bottle of Port, newly opened above ground; and,\naltogether, is an object which no man, who enjoys his dinners, could\nrefrain from hanging over, and caressing.\nNor is this delectable morsel of _old junk_ wanting in many\ninteresting, mournful, and tragic suggestions. Who can say in what\ngales it may have been; in what remote seas it may have sailed? How\nmany stout masts of seventy-fours and frigates it may have staid in the\ntempest? How deep it may have lain, as a hawser, at the bottom of\nstrange harbors? What outlandish fish may have nibbled at it in the\nwater, and what un-catalogued sea-fowl may have pecked at it, when\nforming part of a lofty stay or a shroud?\nNow, this particular part of the rope, this nice little \u201ccut\u201d it was,\nthat among the sailors was the most eagerly sought after. And getting\nhold of a foot or two of old cable, they would cut into it lovingly, to\nsee whether it had any _\u201ctenderloin.\u201d_\nFor my own part, nevertheless, I can not say that this tit-bit was at\nall an agreeable one in the mouth; however pleasant to the sight of an\nantiquary, or to the nose of an epicure in nautical fragrancies.\nIndeed, though possibly I might have been mistaken, I thought it had\nrather an astringent, acrid taste; probably induced by the tar, with\nwhich the flavor of all ropes is more or less vitiated. But the sailors\nseemed to like it, and at any rate nibbled at it with great gusto. They\nconverted one pocket of their trowsers into a junk-shop, and when\nsolicited by a shipmate for a _\u201cchaw,\u201d_ would produce a small coil of\nrope.\nAnother device adopted to alleviate their hardships, was the\nsubstitution of dried tea-leaves, in place of tobacco, for their pipes.\nNo one has ever supped in a forecastle at sea, without having been\nstruck by the prodigious residuum of tea-leaves, or cabbage stalks, in\nhis tin-pot of bohea. There was no lack of material to supply every\npipe-bowl among us.\nI had almost forgotten to relate the most noteworthy thing in this\nmatter; namely, that notwithstanding the general scarcity of the\ngenuine weed, Jackson was provided with a supply; nor did it give out,\nuntil very shortly previous to our arrival in port.\nIn the lowest depths of despair at the loss of their precious solace,\nwhen the sailors would be seated inconsolable as the Babylonish\ncaptives, Jackson would sit cross-legged in his bunk, which was an\nupper one, and enveloped in a cloud of tobacco smoke, would look down\nupon the mourners below, with a sardonic grin at their forlornness.\nHe recalled to mind their folly in selling for filthy lucre, their\nsupplies of the weed; he painted their stupidity; he enlarged upon the\nsufferings they had brought upon themselves; he exaggerated those\nsufferings, and every way derided, reproached, twitted, and hooted at\nthem. No one dared to return his scurrilous animadversions, nor did any\npresume to ask him to relieve their necessities out of his fullness. On\nthe contrary, as has been just related, they divided with him the\n_nail-rods_ they found.\nThe extraordinary dominion of this one miserable Jackson, over twelve\nor fourteen strong, healthy tars, is a riddle, whose solution must be\nleft to the philosophers.\nCHAPTER LV.\nDRAWING NIGH TO THE LAST SCENE IN JACKSON\u2019S CAREER\nThe closing allusion to Jackson in the chapter preceding, reminds me of\na circumstance\u2014which, perhaps, should have been mentioned before\u2014that\nafter we had been at sea about ten days, he pronounced himself too\nunwell to do duty, and accordingly went below to his bunk. And here,\nwith the exception of a few brief intervals of sunning himself in fine\nweather, he remained on his back, or seated cross-legged, during the\nremainder of the homeward-bound passage.\nBrooding there, in his infernal gloom, though nothing but a castaway\nsailor in canvas trowsers, this man was still a picture, worthy to be\npainted by the dark, moody hand of Salvator. In any of that master\u2019s\nlowering sea-pieces, representing the desolate crags of Calabria, with\na midnight shipwreck in the distance, this Jackson\u2019s would have been\nthe face to paint for the doomed vessel\u2019s figurehead, seamed and\nblasted by lightning.\nThough the more sneaking and cowardly of my shipmates whispered among\nthemselves, that Jackson, sure of his wages, whether on duty or off,\nwas only feigning indisposition, nevertheless it was plain that, from\nhis excesses in Liverpool, the malady which had long fastened its fangs\nin his flesh, was now gnawing into his vitals.\nHis cheek became thinner and yellower, and the bones projected like\nthose of a skull. His snaky eyes rolled in red sockets; nor could he\nlift his hand without a violent tremor; while his racking cough many a\ntime startled us from sleep. Yet still in his tremulous grasp he swayed\nhis scepter, and ruled us all like a tyrant to the last.\nThe weaker and weaker he grew, the more outrageous became his treatment\nof the crew. The prospect of the speedy and unshunable death now before\nhim, seemed to exasperate his misanthropic soul into madness; and as if\nhe had indeed sold it to Satan, he seemed determined to die with a\ncurse between his teeth.\nI can never think of him, even now, reclining in his bunk, and with\nshort breaths panting out his maledictions, but I am reminded of that\nmisanthrope upon the throne of the world\u2014the diabolical Tiberius at\nCaprese; who even in his self-exile, imbittered by bodily pangs, and\nunspeakable mental terrors only known to the damned on earth, yet did\nnot give over his blasphemies but endeavored to drag down with him to\nhis own perdition, all who came within the evil spell of his power. And\nthough Tiberius came in the succession of the Caesars, and though\nunmatchable Tacitus has embalmed his carrion, yet do I account this\nYankee Jackson full as dignified a personage as he, and as well\nmeriting his lofty gallows in history; even though he was a nameless\nvagabond without an epitaph, and none, but I, narrate what he was. For\nthere is no dignity in wickedness, whether in purple or rags; and hell\nis a democracy of devils, where all are equals. There, Nero howls side\nby side with his own malefactors. If Napoleon were truly but a martial\nmurderer, I pay him no more homage than I would a felon. Though\nMilton\u2019s Satan dilutes our abhorrence with admiration, it is only\nbecause he is not a genuine being, but something altered from a genuine\noriginal. We gather not from the four gospels alone, any high-raised\nfancies concerning this Satan; we only know him from thence as the\npersonification of the essence of evil, which, who but pickpockets and\nburglars will admire? But this takes not from the merit of our\nhigh-priest of poetry; it only enhances it, that with such unmitigated\nevil for his material, he should build up his most goodly structure.\nBut in historically canonizing on earth the condemned below, and\nlifting up and lauding the illustrious damned, we do but make examples\nof wickedness; and call upon ambition to do some great iniquity, and be\nsure of fame.\nCHAPTER LVI.\nUNDER THE LEE OF THE LONG-BOAT, REDBURN AND HARRY HOLD CONFIDENTIAL\nCOMMUNION\nA sweet thing is a song; and though the Hebrew captives hung their\nharps on the willows, that they could not sing the melodies of\nPalestine before the haughty beards of the Babylonians; yet, to\nthemselves, those melodies of other times and a distant land were as\nsweet as the June dew on Hermon.\nAnd poor Harry was as the Hebrews. He, too, had been carried away\ncaptive, though his chief captor and foe was himself; and he, too, many\na night, was called upon to sing for those who through the day had\ninsulted and derided him.\nHis voice was just the voice to proceed from a small, silken person\nlike his; it was gentle and liquid, and meandered and tinkled through\nthe words of a song, like a musical brook that winds and wantons by\npied and pansied margins.\n\u201c_I_ can\u2019t sing to-night\u201d\u2014sadly said Harry to the Dutchman, who with\nhis watchmates requested him to while away the middle watch with his\nmelody\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t sing to-night. But, Wellingborough,\u201d he whispered,\u2014and\nI stooped my ear,\u2014 \u201ccome _you_ with me under the lee of the long-boat,\nand there I\u2019ll hum you an air.\u201d\nIt was _The Banks of the Blue Moselle._\nPoor, poor Harry! and a thousand times friendless and forlorn! To be\nsinging that thing, which was only meant to be warbled by falling\nfountains in gardens, or in elegant alcoves in drawing-rooms,\u2014to be\nsinging it _here\u2014here,_ as I live, under the tarry lee of our\nlong-boat.\nBut he sang, and sang, as I watched the waves, and peopled them all\nwith sprites, and cried _\u201cchassez!\u201d \u201chands across!\u201d_ to the\nmultitudinous quadrilles, all danced on the moonlit, musical floor.\nBut though it went so hard with my friend to sing his songs to this\nruffian crew, whom he hated, even in his dreams, till the foam flew\nfrom his mouth while he slept; yet at last I prevailed upon him to\nmaster his feelings, and make them subservient to his interests. For so\ndelighted, even with the rudest minstrelsy, are sailors, that I well\nknew Harry possessed a spell over them, which, for the time at least,\nthey could not resist; and it might induce them to treat with more\ndeference the being who was capable of yielding them such delight.\nCarlo\u2019s organ they did not so much care for; but the voice of my Bury\nblade was an accordion in their ears.\nSo one night, on the windlass, he sat and sang; and from the ribald\njests so common to sailors, the men slid into silence at every verse.\nHushed, and more hushed they grew, till at last Harry sat among them\nlike Orpheus among the charmed leopards and tigers. Harmless now the\nfangs with which they were wont to tear my zebra, and backward curled\nin velvet paws; and fixed their once glaring eyes in fascinated and\nfascinating brilliancy. Ay, still and hissingly all, for a time, they\nrelinquished their prey.\nNow, during the voyage, the treatment of the crew threw Harry more and\nmore upon myself for companionship; and few can keep constant company\nwith another, without revealing some, at least, of their secrets; for\nall of us yearn for sympathy, even if we do not for love; and to be\nintellectually alone is a thing only tolerable to genius, whose\ncherisher and inspirer is solitude.\nBut though my friend became more communicative concerning his past\ncareer than ever he had been before, yet he did not make plain many\nthings in his hitherto but partly divulged history, which I was very\ncurious to know; and especially he never made the remotest allusion to\naught connected with our trip to London; while the oath of secrecy by\nwhich he had bound me held my curiosity on that point a captive.\nHowever, as it was, Harry made many very interesting disclosures; and\nif he did not gratify me more in that respect, he atoned for it in a\nmeasure, by dwelling upon the future, and the prospects, such as they\nwere, which the future held out to him.\nHe confessed that he had no money but a few shillings left from the\nexpenses of our return from London; that only by selling some more of\nhis clothing, could he pay for his first week\u2019s board in New York; and\nthat he was altogether without any regular profession or business, upon\nwhich, by his own exertions, he could securely rely for support. And\nyet, he told me that he was determined never again to return to\nEngland; and that somewhere in America he must work out his temporal\nfelicity.\n\u201cI have forgotten England,\u201d he said, \u201cand never more mean to think of\nit; so tell me, Wellingborough, what am I to do in America?\u201d\nIt was a puzzling question, and full of grief to me, who, young though\nI was, had been well rubbed, curried, and ground down to fine powder in\nthe hopper of an evil fortune, and who therefore could sympathize with\none in similar circumstances. For though we may look grave and behave\nkindly and considerately to a friend in calamity; yet, if we have never\nactually experienced something like the woe that weighs him down, we\ncan not with the best grace proffer our sympathy. And perhaps there is\nno true sympathy but between equals; and it may be, that we should\ndistrust that man\u2019s sincerity, who stoops to condole with us.\nSo Harry and I, two friendless wanderers, beguiled many a long watch by\ntalking over our common affairs. But inefficient, as a benefactor, as I\ncertainly was; still, being an American, and returning to my home; even\nas he was a stranger, and hurrying from his; therefore, I stood toward\nhim in the attitude of the prospective doer of the honors of my\ncountry; I accounted him the nation\u2019s guest. Hence, I esteemed it more\nbefitting, that I should rather talk with him, than he with me: that\n_his_ prospects and plans should engage our attention, in preference to\nmy own.\nNow, seeing that Harry was so brave a songster, and could sing such\nbewitching airs: I suggested whether his musical talents could not be\nturned to account. The thought struck him most favorably\u2014\u201cGad, my boy,\nyou have hit it, you have,\u201d and then he went on to mention, that in\nsome places in England, it was customary for two or three young men of\nhighly respectable families, of undoubted antiquity, but unfortunately\nin lamentably decayed circumstances, and thread-bare coats\u2014it was\ncustomary for two or three young gentlemen, so situated, to obtain\ntheir livelihood by their voices: coining their silvery songs into\nsilvery shillings.\nThey wandered from door to door, and rang the bell\u2014Are _the ladies and\ngentlemen in?_ Seeing them at least gentlemanly looking, if not\nsumptuously appareled, the servant generally admitted them at once; and\nwhen the people entered to greet them, their spokesman would rise with\na gentle bow, and a smile, and say, _We come, ladies and gentlemen, to\nsing you a song: we are singers, at your service._ And so, without\nwaiting reply, forth they burst into song; and having most mellifluous\nvoices, enchanted and transported all auditors; so much so, that at the\nconclusion of the entertainment, they very seldom failed to be well\nrecompensed, and departed with an invitation to return again, and make\nthe occupants of that dwelling once more delighted and happy.\n\u201cCould not something of this kind now, be done in New York?\u201d said\nHarry, \u201cor are there no parlors with ladies in them, there?\u201d he\nanxiously added.\nAgain I assured him, as I had often done before, that New York was a\ncivilized and enlightened town; with a large population, fine streets,\nfine houses, nay, plenty of omnibuses; and that for the most part, he\nwould almost think himself in England; so similar to England, in\nessentials, was this outlandish America that haunted him.\nI could not but be struck\u2014and had I not been, from my birth, as it\nwere, a cosmopolite\u2014I had been amazed at his skepticism with regard to\nthe civilization of my native land. A greater patriot than myself might\nhave resented his insinuations. He seemed to think that we Yankees\nlived in wigwams, and wore bear-skins. After all, Harry was a spice of\na Cockney, and had shut up his Christendom in London.\nHaving then assured him, that I could see no reason, why he should not\nplay the troubadour in New York, as well as elsewhere; he suddenly\npopped upon me the question, whether I would not join him in the\nenterprise; as it would be quite out of the question to go alone on\nsuch a business.\nSaid I, \u201cMy dear Bury, I have no more voice for a ditty, than a dumb\nman has for an oration. Sing? Such Macadamized lungs have I, that I\nthink myself well off, that I can talk; let alone nightingaling.\u201d\nSo that plan was quashed; and by-and-by Harry began to give up the idea\nof singing himself into a livelihood.\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t sing for my mutton,\u201d said he\u2014\u201cwhat would Lady Georgiana\nsay?\u201d\n\u201cIf I could see her ladyship once, I might tell you, Harry,\u201d returned\nI, who did not exactly doubt him, but felt ill at ease for my bosom\nfriend\u2019s conscience, when he alluded to his various noble and right\nhonorable friends and relations.\n\u201cBut surely, Bury, my friend, you must write a clerkly hand, among your\nother accomplishments; and _that_ at least, will be sure to help you.\u201d\n\u201cI _do_ write a hand,\u201d he gladly rejoined\u2014\u201cthere, look at the\nimplement!\u2014do you not think, that such a hand as _that_ might dot an\n_i,_ or cross a _t,_ with a touching grace and tenderness?\u201d\nIndeed, but it did betoken a most excellent penmanship. It was small;\nand the fingers were long and thin; the knuckles softly rounded; the\nnails hemispherical at the base; and the smooth palm furnishing few\ncharacters for an Egyptian fortune-teller to read. It was not as the\nsturdy farmer\u2019s hand of Cincinnatus, who followed the plough and guided\nthe state; but it was as the perfumed hand of Petronius Arbiter, that\nelegant young buck of a Roman, who once cut great Seneca dead in the\nforum.\nHis hand alone, would have entitled my Bury blade to the suffrages of\nthat Eastern potentate, who complimented Lord Byron upon his feline\nfingers, declaring that they furnished indubitable evidence of his\nnoble birth. And so it did: for Lord Byron was as all the rest of\nus\u2014the son of a _man._ And so are the dainty-handed, and wee-footed\nhalf-cast paupers in Lima; who, if their hands and feet were entitled\nto consideration, would constitute the oligarchy of all Peru.\nFolly and foolishness! to think that a gentleman is known by his\nfinger-nails, like Nebuchadnezzar, when his grew long in the pasture:\nor that the badge of nobility is to be found in the smallness of the\nfoot, when even a fish has no foot at all!\nDandies! amputate yourselves, if you will; but know, and be assured,\noh, democrats, that, like a pyramid, a great man stands on a broad\nbase. It is only the brittle porcelain pagoda, that tottles on a toe.\nBut though Harry\u2019s hand was lady-like looking, and had once been white\nas the queen\u2019s cambric handkerchief, and free from a stain as the\nreputation of Diana; yet, his late pulling and hauling of halyards and\nclew-lines, and his occasional dabbling in tar-pots and slush-shoes,\nhad somewhat subtracted from its original daintiness.\nOften he ruefully eyed it.\nOh! hand! thought Harry, ah, hand! what have you come to? Is it seemly,\nthat you should be polluted with pitch, when you once handed countesses\nto their coaches? Is _this_ the hand I kissed to the divine Georgiana?\nwith which I pledged Lady Blessington, and ratified my bond to Lord\nLovely? _This_ the hand that Georgiana clasped to her bosom, when she\nvowed she was mine?\u2014Out of sight, recreant and apostate!\u2014deep\ndown\u2014disappear in this foul monkey-jacket pocket where I thrust you!\nAfter many long conversations, it was at last pretty well decided, that\nupon our arrival at New York, some means should be taken among my few\nfriends there, to get Harry a place in a mercantile house, where he\nmight flourish his pen, and gently exercise his delicate digits, by\ntraversing some soft foolscap; in the same way that slim, pallid ladies\nare gently drawn through a park for an airing.\nCHAPTER LVII.\nALMOST A FAMINE\n\u201cMammy! mammy! come and see the sailors eating out of little troughs,\njust like our pigs at home.\u201d Thus exclaimed one of the steerage\nchildren, who at dinner-time was peeping down into the forecastle,\nwhere the crew were assembled, helping themselves from the \u201ckids,\u201d\nwhich, indeed, resemble hog-troughs not a little.\n\u201cPigs, is it?\u201d coughed Jackson, from his bunk, where he sat presiding\nover the banquet, but not partaking, like a devil who had lost his\nappetite by chewing sulphur.\u2014\u201cPigs, is it?\u2014and the day is close by, ye\nspalpeens, when you\u2019ll want to be after taking a sup at our troughs!\u201d\nThis malicious prophecy proved true.\nAs day followed day without glimpse of shore or reef, and head winds\ndrove the ship back, as hounds a deer; the improvidence and\nshortsightedness of the passengers in the steerage, with regard to\ntheir outfits for the voyage, began to be followed by the inevitable\nresults.\nMany of them at last went aft to the mate, saying that they had nothing\nto eat, their provisions were expended, and they must be supplied from\nthe ship\u2019s stores, or starve.\nThis was told to the captain, who was obliged to issue a ukase from the\ncabin, that every steerage passenger, whose destitution was\ndemonstrable, should be given one sea-biscuit and two potatoes a day; a\nsort of substitute for a muffin and a brace of poached eggs.\nBut this scanty ration was quite insufficient to satisfy their hunger:\nhardly enough to satisfy the necessities of a healthy adult. The\nconsequence was, that all day long, and all through the night, scores\nof the emigrants went about the decks, seeking what they might devour.\nThey plundered the chicken-coop; and disguising the fowls, cooked them\nat the public galley. They made inroads upon the pig-pen in the boat,\nand carried off a promising young shoat: _him_ they devoured raw, not\nventuring to make an incognito of his carcass; they prowled about the\ncook\u2019s caboose, till he threatened them with a ladle of scalding water;\nthey waylaid the steward on his regular excursions from the cook to the\ncabin; they hung round the forecastle, to rob the bread-barge; they\nbeset the sailors, like beggars in the streets, craving a mouthful in\nthe name of the Church.\nAt length, to such excesses were they driven, that the Grand Russian,\nCaptain Riga, issued another ukase, and to this effect: Whatsoever\nemigrant is found guilty of stealing, the same shall be tied into the\nrigging and flogged.\nUpon this, there were secret movements in the steerage, which almost\nalarmed me for the safety of the ship; but nothing serious took place,\nafter all; and they even acquiesced in, or did not resent, a singular\npunishment which the captain caused to be inflicted upon a culprit of\ntheir clan, as a substitute for a flogging. For no doubt he thought\nthat such rigorous discipline as _that_ might exasperate five hundred\nemigrants into an insurrection.\nA head was fitted to one of the large deck-tubs\u2014the half of a cask; and\ninto this head a hole was cut; also, two smaller holes in the bottom of\nthe tub. The head\u2014divided in the middle, across the diameter of the\norifice\u2014was now fitted round the culprit\u2019s neck; and he was forthwith\ncoopered up into the tub, which rested on his shoulders, while his legs\nprotruded through the holes in the bottom.\nIt was a burden to carry; but the man could walk with it; and so\nridiculous was his appearance, that spite of the indignity, he himself\nlaughed with the rest at the figure he cut.\n\u201cNow, Pat, my boy,\u201d said the mate, \u201cfill that big wooden belly of\nyours, if you can.\u201d\nCompassionating his situation, our old \u201cdoctor\u201d used to give him alms\nof food, placing it upon the cask-head before him; till at last, when\nthe time for deliverance came, Pat protested against mercy, and would\nfain have continued playing Diogenes in the tub for the rest of this\nstarving voyage.\nCHAPTER LVIII.\nTHOUGH THE HIGHLANDER PUTS INTO NO HARBOR AS YET; SHE HERE AND THERE\nLEAVES MANY OF HER PASSENGERS BEHIND\nAlthough fast-sailing ships, blest with prosperous breezes, have\nfrequently made the run across the Atlantic in eighteen days; yet, it\nis not uncommon for other vessels to be forty, or fifty, and even\nsixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety days, in making the same passage.\nThough in the latter cases, some signal calamity or incapacity must\noccasion so great a detention. It is also true, that generally the\npassage out from America is shorter than the return; which is to be\nascribed to the prevalence of westerly winds.\nWe had been outside of Cape Clear upward of twenty days, still harassed\nby head-winds, though with pleasant weather upon the whole, when we\nwere visited by a succession of rain storms, which lasted the greater\npart of a week.\nDuring the interval, the emigrants were obliged to remain below; but\nthis was nothing strange to some of them; who, not recovering, while at\nsea, from their first attack of seasickness, seldom or never made their\nappearance on deck, during the entire passage.\nDuring the week, now in question, fire was only once made in the public\ngalley. This occasioned a good deal of domestic work to be done in the\nsteerage, which otherwise would have been done in the open air. When\nthe lulls of the rain-storms would intervene, some unusually cleanly\nemigrant would climb to the deck, with a bucket of slops, to toss into\nthe sea. No experience seemed sufficient to instruct some of these\nignorant people in the simplest, and most elemental principles of\nocean-life. Spite of all lectures on the subject, several would\ncontinue to shun the leeward side of the vessel, with their slops. One\nmorning, when it was blowing very fresh, a simple fellow pitched over a\ngallon or two of something to windward. Instantly it flew back in his\nface; and also, in the face of the chief mate, who happened to be\nstanding by at the time. The offender was collared, and shaken on the\nspot; and ironically commanded, never, for the future, to throw any\nthing to windward at sea, but fine ashes and scalding hot water.\nDuring the frequent _hard blows_ we experienced, the hatchways on the\nsteerage were, at intervals, hermetically closed; sealing down in their\nnoisome den, those scores of human beings. It was something to be\nmarveled at, that the shocking fate, which, but a short time ago,\novertook the poor passengers in a Liverpool steamer in the Channel,\nduring similar stormy weather, and under similar treatment, did not\novertake some of the emigrants of the Highlander.\nNevertheless, it was, beyond question, this noisome confinement in so\nclose, unventilated, and crowded a den: joined to the deprivation of\nsufficient food, from which many were suffering; which, helped by their\npersonal uncleanliness, brought on a malignant fever.\nThe first report was, that two persons were affected. No sooner was it\nknown, than the mate promptly repaired to the medicine-chest in the\ncabin: and with the remedies deemed suitable, descended into the\nsteerage. But the medicines proved of no avail; the invalids rapidly\ngrew worse; and two more of the emigrants became infected.\nUpon this, the captain himself went to see them; and returning, sought\nout a certain alleged physician among the cabin-passengers; begging him\nto wait upon the sufferers; hinting that, thereby, he might prevent the\ndisease from extending into the cabin itself. But this person denied\nbeing a physician; and from fear of contagion\u2014though he did not confess\nthat to be the motive\u2014refused even to enter the steerage. The cases\nincreased: the utmost alarm spread through the ship: and scenes ensued,\nover which, for the most part, a veil must be drawn; for such is the\nfastidiousness of some readers, that, many times, they must lose the\nmost striking incidents in a narrative like mine.\nMany of the panic-stricken emigrants would fain now have domiciled on\ndeck; but being so scantily clothed, the wretched weather\u2014wet, cold,\nand tempestuous\u2014drove the best part of them again below. Yet any other\nhuman beings, perhaps, would rather have faced the most outrageous\nstorm, than continued to breathe the pestilent air of the steerage. But\nsome of these poor people must have been so used to the most abasing\ncalamities, that the atmosphere of a lazar-house almost seemed their\nnatural air.\nThe first four cases happened to be in adjoining bunks; and the\nemigrants who slept in the farther part of the steerage, threw up a\nbarricade in front of those bunks; so as to cut off communication. But\nthis was no sooner reported to the captain, than he ordered it to be\nthrown down; since it could be of no possible benefit; but would only\nmake still worse, what was already direful enough.\nIt was not till after a good deal of mingled threatening and coaxing,\nthat the mate succeeded in getting the sailors below, to accomplish the\ncaptain\u2019s order.\nThe sight that greeted us, upon entering, was wretched indeed. It was\nlike entering a crowded jail. From the rows of rude bunks, hundreds of\nmeager, begrimed faces were turned upon us; while seated upon the\nchests, were scores of unshaven men, smoking tea-leaves, and creating a\nsuffocating vapor. But this vapor was better than the native air of the\nplace, which from almost unbelievable causes, was fetid in the extreme.\nIn every corner, the females were huddled together, weeping and\nlamenting; children were asking bread from their mothers, who had none\nto give; and old men, seated upon the floor, were leaning back against\nthe heads of the water-casks, with closed eyes and fetching their\nbreath with a gasp.\nAt one end of the place was seen the barricade, hiding the invalids;\nwhile\u2014notwithstanding the crowd\u2014in front of it was a clear area, which\nthe fear of contagion had left open.\n\u201cThat bulkhead must come down,\u201d cried the mate, in a voice that rose\nabove the din. \u201cTake hold of it, boys.\u201d\nBut hardly had we touched the chests composing it, when a crowd of\npale-faced, infuriated men rushed up; and with terrific howls, swore\nthey would slay us, if we did not desist.\n\u201cHaul it down!\u201d roared the mate.\nBut the sailors fell back, murmuring something about merchant seamen\nhaving no pensions in case of being maimed, and they had not shipped to\nfight fifty to one. Further efforts were made by the mate, who at last\nhad recourse to entreaty; but it would not do; and we were obliged to\ndepart, without achieving our object.\nAbout four o\u2019clock that morning, the first four died. They were all\nmen; and the scenes which ensued were frantic in the extreme.\nCertainly, the bottomless profound of the sea, over which we were\nsailing, concealed nothing more frightful.\nOrders were at once passed to bury the dead. But this was unnecessary.\nBy their own countrymen, they were torn from the clasp of their wives,\nrolled in their own bedding, with ballast-stones, and with hurried\nrites, were dropped into the ocean.\nAt this time, ten more men had caught the disease; and with a degree of\ndevotion worthy all praise, the mate attended them with his medicines;\nbut the captain did not again go down to them.\nIt was all-important now that the steerage should be purified; and had\nit not been for the rains and squalls, which would have made it madness\nto turn such a number of women and children upon the wet and\nunsheltered decks, the steerage passengers would have been ordered\nabove, and their den have been given a thorough cleansing. But, for the\npresent, this was out of the question. The sailors peremptorily refused\nto go among the defilements to remove them; and so besotted were the\ngreater part of the emigrants themselves, that though the necessity of\nthe case was forcibly painted to them, they would not lift a hand to\nassist in what seemed their own salvation.\nThe panic in the cabin was now very great; and for fear of contagion to\nthemselves, the cabin passengers would fain have made a prisoner of the\ncaptain, to prevent him from going forward beyond the mainmast. Their\nclamors at last induced him to tell the two mates, that for the present\nthey must sleep and take their meals elsewhere than in their old\nquarters, which communicated with the cabin.\nOn land, a pestilence is fearful enough; but there, many can flee from\nan infected city; whereas, in a ship, you are locked and bolted in the\nvery hospital itself. Nor is there any possibility of escape from it;\nand in so small and crowded a place, no precaution can effectually\nguard against contagion.\nHorrible as the sights of the steerage now were, the cabin, perhaps,\npresented a scene equally despairing. Many, who had seldom prayed\nbefore, now implored the merciful heavens, night and day, for fair\nwinds and fine weather. Trunks were opened for Bibles; and at last,\neven prayer-meetings were held over the very table across which the\nloud jest had been so often heard.\nStrange, though almost universal, that the seemingly nearer prospect of\nthat death which any body at any time may die, should produce these\nspasmodic devotions, when an everlasting Asiatic Cholera is forever\nthinning our ranks; and die by death we all must at last.\nOn the second day, seven died, one of whom was the little tailor; on\nthe third, four; on the fourth, six, of whom one was the Greenland\nsailor, and another, a woman in the cabin, whose death, however, was\nafterward supposed to have been purely induced by her fears. These last\ndeaths brought the panic to its height; and sailors, officers,\ncabin-passengers, and emigrants\u2014all looked upon each other like lepers.\nAll but the only true leper among us\u2014the mariner Jackson, who seemed\nelated with the thought, that for _him\u2014_already in the deadly clutches\nof another disease\u2014no danger was to be apprehended from a fever which\nonly swept off the comparatively healthy. Thus, in the midst of the\ndespair of the healthful, this incurable invalid was not cast down;\nnot, at least, by the same considerations that appalled the rest.\nAnd still, beneath a gray, gloomy sky, the doomed craft beat on; now on\nthis tack, now on that; battling against hostile blasts, and drenched\nin rain and spray; scarcely making an inch of progress toward her port.\nOn the sixth morning, the weather merged into a gale, to which we\nstripped our ship to a storm-stay-sail. In ten hours\u2019 time, the waves\nran in mountains; and the Highlander rose and fell like some vast buoy\non the water. Shrieks and lamentations were driven to leeward, and\ndrowned in the roar of the wind among the cordage; while we gave to the\ngale the blackened bodies of five more of the dead.\nBut as the dying departed, the places of two of them were filled in the\nrolls of humanity, by the birth of two infants, whom the plague, panic,\nand gale had hurried into the world before their time. The first cry of\none of these infants, was almost simultaneous with the splash of its\nfather\u2019s body in the sea. Thus we come and we go. But, surrounded by\ndeath, both mothers and babes survived.\nAt midnight, the wind went down; leaving a long, rolling sea; and, for\nthe first time in a week, a clear, starry sky.\nIn the first morning-watch, I sat with Harry on the windlass, watching\nthe billows; which, seen in the night, seemed real hills, upon which\nfortresses might have been built; and real valleys, in which villages,\nand groves, and gardens, might have nestled. It was like a landscape in\nSwitzerland; for down into those dark, purple glens, often tumbled the\nwhite foam of the wave-crests, like avalanches; while the seething and\nboiling that ensued, seemed the swallowing up of human beings.\nBy the afternoon of the next day this heavy sea subsided; and we bore\ndown on the waves, with all our canvas set; stun\u2019-sails alow and aloft;\nand our best steersman at the helm; the captain himself at his\nelbow;\u2014bowling along, with a fair, cheering breeze over the taffrail.\nThe decks were cleared, and swabbed bone-dry; and then, all the\nemigrants who were not invalids, poured themselves out on deck,\nsnuffing the delightful air, spreading their damp bedding in the sun,\nand regaling themselves with the generous charity of the captain, who\nof late had seen fit to increase their allowance of food. A detachment\nof them now joined a band of the crew, who proceeding into the\nsteerage, with buckets and brooms, gave it a thorough cleansing,\nsending on deck, I know not how many bucketsful of defilements. It was\nmore like cleaning out a stable, than a retreat for men and women. This\nday we buried three; the next day one, and then the pestilence left us,\nwith seven convalescent; who, placed near the opening of the hatchway,\nsoon rallied under the skillful treatment, and even tender care of the\nmate.\nBut even under this favorable turn of affairs, much apprehension was\nstill entertained, lest in crossing the Grand Banks of Newfoundland,\nthe fogs, so generally encountered there, might bring on a return of\nthe fever. But, to the joy of all hands, our fair wind still held on;\nand we made a rapid run across these dreaded shoals, and southward\nsteered for New York.\nOur days were now fair and mild, and though the wind abated, yet we\nstill ran our course over a pleasant sea. The steerage-passengers\u2014at\nleast by far the greater number\u2014wore a still, subdued aspect, though a\nlittle cheered by the genial air, and the hopeful thought of soon\nreaching their port. But those who had lost fathers, husbands, wives,\nor children, needed no crape, to reveal to others, who they were. Hard\nand bitter indeed was their lot; for with the poor and desolate, grief\nis no indulgence of mere sentiment, however sincere, but a gnawing\nreality, that eats into their vital beings; they have no kind\ncondolers, and bland physicians, and troops of sympathizing friends;\nand they must toil, though to-morrow be the burial, and their\npallbearers throw down the hammer to lift up the coffin.\nHow, then, with these emigrants, who, three thousand miles from home,\nsuddenly found themselves deprived of brothers and husbands, with but a\nfew pounds, or perhaps but a few shillings, to buy food in a strange\nland?\nAs for the passengers in the cabin, who now so jocund as they? drawing\nnigh, with their long purses and goodly portmanteaus to the promised\nland, without fear of fate. One and all were generous and gay, the\njelly-eyed old gentleman, before spoken of, gave a shilling to the\nsteward.\nThe lady who had died, was an elderly person, an American, returning\nfrom a visit to an only brother in London. She had no friend or\nrelative on board, hence, as there is little mourning for a stranger\ndying among strangers, her memory had been buried with her body.\nBut the thing most worthy of note among these now light-hearted people\nin feathers, was the gay way in which some of them bantered others,\nupon the panic into which nearly all had been thrown.\nAnd since, if the extremest fear of a crowd in a panic of peril, proves\ngrounded on causes sufficient, they must then indeed come to\nperish;\u2014therefore it is, that at such times they must make up their\nminds either to die, or else survive to be taunted by their fellow-men\nwith their fear. For except in extraordinary instances of exposure,\nthere are few living men, who, at bottom, are not very slow to admit\nthat any other living men have ever been very much nearer death than\nthemselves. Accordingly, _craven_ is the phrase too often applied to\nany one who, with however good reason, has been appalled at the\nprospect of sudden death, and yet lived to escape it. Though, should he\nhave perished in conformity with his fears, not a syllable of _craven_\nwould you hear. This is the language of one, who more than once has\nbeheld the scenes, whence these principles have been deduced. The\nsubject invites much subtle speculation; for in every being\u2019s ideas of\ndeath, and his behavior when it suddenly menaces him, lies the best\nindex to his life and his faith. Though the Christian era had not then\nbegun, Socrates died the death of the Christian; and though Hume was\nnot a Christian in theory, yet he, too, died the death of the\nChristian,\u2014humble, composed, without bravado; and though the most\nskeptical of philosophical skeptics, yet full of that firm, creedless\nfaith, that embraces the spheres. Seneca died dictating to posterity;\nPetronius lightly discoursing of essences and love-songs; and Addison,\ncalling upon Christendom to behold how calmly a Christian could die;\nbut not even the last of these three, perhaps, died the best death of\nthe Christian.\nThe cabin passenger who had used to read prayers while the rest kneeled\nagainst the transoms and settees, was one of the merry young sparks,\nwho had occasioned such agonies of jealousy to the poor tailor, now no\nmore. In his rakish vest, and dangling watch-chain, this same youth,\nwith all the awfulness of fear, had led the earnest petitions of his\ncompanions; supplicating mercy, where before he had never solicited the\nslightest favor. More than once had he been seen thus engaged by the\nobservant steersman at the helm: who looked through the little glass in\nthe cabin bulk-head.\nBut this youth was an April man; the storm had departed; and now he\nshone in the sun, none braver than he.\nOne of his jovial companions ironically advised him to enter into holy\norders upon his arrival in New York.\n\u201cWhy so?\u201d said the other, \u201chave I such an orotund voice?\u201d\n\u201cNo;\u201d profanely returned his friend\u2014\u201cbut you are a coward\u2014just the man\nto be a parson, and pray.\u201d\nHowever this narrative of the circumstances attending the fever among\nthe emigrants on the Highland may appear; and though these things\nhappened so long ago; yet just such events, nevertheless, are perhaps\ntaking place to-day. But the only account you obtain of such events, is\ngenerally contained in a newspaper paragraph, under the shipping-head.\n_There_ is the obituary of the destitute dead, who die on the sea. They\ndie, like the billows that break on the shore, and no more are heard or\nseen. But in the events, thus merely initialized in the catalogue of\npassing occurrences, and but glanced at by the readers of news, who are\nmore taken up with paragraphs of fuller flavor; what a world of life\nand death, what a world of humanity and its woes, lies shrunk into a\nthree-worded sentence!\nYou see no plague-ship driving through a stormy sea; you hear no groans\nof despair; you see no corpses thrown over the bulwarks; you mark not\nthe wringing hands and torn hair of widows and orphans:\u2014all is a blank.\nAnd one of these blanks I have but filled up, in recounting the details\nof the Highlander\u2019s calamity.\nBesides that natural tendency, which hurries into oblivion the last\nwoes of the poor; other causes combine to suppress the detailed\ncircumstances of disasters like these. Such things, if widely known,\noperate unfavorably to the ship, and make her a bad name; and to avoid\ndetention at quarantine, a captain will state the case in the most\npalliating light, and strive to hush it up, as much as he can.\nIn no better place than this, perhaps, can a few words be said,\nconcerning emigrant ships in general.\nLet us waive that agitated national topic, as to whether such\nmultitudes of foreign poor should be landed on our American shores; let\nus waive it, with the one only thought, that if they can get here, they\nhave God\u2019s right to come; though they bring all Ireland and her\nmiseries with them. For the whole world is the patrimony of the whole\nworld; there is no telling who does not own a stone in the Great Wall\nof China. But we waive all this; and will only consider, how best the\nemigrants can come hither, since come they do, and come they must and\nwill.\nOf late, a law has been passed in Congress, restricting ships to a\ncertain number of emigrants, according to a certain rate. If this law\nwere enforced, much good might be done; and so also might much good be\ndone, were the English law likewise enforced, concerning the fixed\nsupply of food for every emigrant embarking from Liverpool. But it is\nhardly to be believed, that either of these laws is observed.\nBut in all respects, no legislation, even nominally, reaches the hard\nlot of the emigrant. What ordinance makes it obligatory upon the\ncaptain of a ship, to supply the steerage-passengers with decent\nlodgings, and give them light and air in that foul den, where they are\nimmured, during a long voyage across the Atlantic? What ordinance\nnecessitates him to place the _galley,_ or steerage-passengers\u2019 stove,\nin a dry place of shelter, where the emigrants can do their cooking\nduring a storm, or wet weather? What ordinance obliges him to give them\nmore room on deck, and let them have an occasional run fore and\naft?\u2014There is no law concerning these things. And if there was, who but\nsome Howard in office would see it enforced? and how seldom is there a\nHoward in office!\nWe talk of the Turks, and abhor the cannibals; but may not some of\n_them,_ go to heaven, before some of _us?_ We may have civilized bodies\nand yet barbarous souls. We are blind to the real sights of this world;\ndeaf to its voice; and dead to its death. And not till we know, that\none grief outweighs ten thousand joys, will we become what Christianity\nis striving to make us.\nCHAPTER LIX.\nTHE LAST END OF JACKSON\n\u201cOff Cape Cod!\u201d said the steward, coming forward from the quarter-deck,\nwhere the captain had just been taking his noon observation; sweeping\nthe vast horizon with his quadrant, like a dandy circumnavigating the\ndress-circle of an amphitheater with his glass.\n_Off Cape Cod!_ and in the shore-bloom that came to us\u2014 even from that\ndesert of sand-hillocks\u2014methought I could almost distinguish the\nfragrance of the rose-bush my sisters and I had planted, in our far\ninland garden at home. Delicious odors are those of our mother Earth;\nwhich like a flower-pot set with a thousand shrubs, greets the eager\nvoyager from afar.\nThe breeze was stiff, and so drove us along that we turned over two\nbroad, blue furrows from our bows, as we plowed the watery prairie. By\nnight it was a reef-topsail-breeze; but so impatient was the captain to\nmake his port before a shift of wind overtook us, that even yet we\ncarried a main-topgallant-sail, though the light mast sprung like a\nswitch.\nIn the second dog-watch, however, the breeze became such, that at last\nthe order was given to douse the top-gallant-sail, and clap a reef into\nall three top-sails.\nWhile the men were settling away the halyards on deck, and before they\nhad begun to haul out the reef-tackles, to the surprise of several,\nJackson came up from the forecastle, and, for the first time in four\nweeks or more, took hold of a rope.\nLike most seamen, who during the greater part of a voyage, have been\noff duty from sickness, he was, perhaps, desirous, just previous to\nentering port, of reminding the captain of his existence, and also that\nhe expected his wages; but, alas! his wages proved the wages of sin.\nAt no time could he better signalize his disposition to work, than upon\nan occasion like the present; which generally attracts every soul on\ndeck, from the captain to the child in the steerage.\nHis aspect was damp and death-like; the blue hollows of his eyes were\nlike vaults full of snakes; and issuing so unexpectedly from his dark\ntomb in the forecastle, he looked like a man raised from the dead.\nBefore the sailors had made fast the reef-tackle, Jackson was tottering\nup the rigging; thus getting the start of them, and securing his place\nat the extreme weather-end of the topsail-yard\u2014which in reefing is\naccounted the post of honor. For it was one of the characteristics of\nthis man, that though when on duty he would shy away from mere dull\nwork in a calm, yet in tempest-time he always claimed the van, and\nwould yield it to none; and this, perhaps, was one cause of his\nunbounded dominion over the men.\nSoon, we were all strung along the main-topsail-yard; the ship rearing\nand plunging under us, like a runaway steed; each man gripping his\nreef-point, and sideways leaning, dragging the sail over toward\nJackson, whose business it was to confine the reef corner to the yard.\nHis hat and shoes were off; and he rode the yard-arm end, leaning\nbackward to the gale, and pulling at the earing-rope, like a bridle. At\nall times, this is a moment of frantic exertion with sailors, whose\nspirits seem then to partake of the commotion of the elements, as they\nhang in the gale, between heaven and earth; and _then_ it is, too, that\nthey are the most profane.\n\u201cHaul out to windward!\u201d coughed Jackson, with a blasphemous cry, and he\nthrew himself back with a violent strain upon the bridle in his hand.\nBut the wild words were hardly out of his mouth, when his hands dropped\nto his side, and the bellying sail was spattered with a torrent of\nblood from his lungs.\nAs the man next him stretched out his arm to save, Jackson fell\nheadlong from the yard, and with a long seethe, plunged like a diver\ninto the sea.\nIt was when the ship had rolled to windward, which, with the long\nprojection of the yard-arm over the side, made him strike far out upon\nthe water. His fall was seen by the whole upward-gazing crowd on deck,\nsome of whom were spotted with the blood that trickled from the sail,\nwhile they raised a spontaneous cry, so shrill and wild, that a blind\nman might have known something deadly had happened.\nClutching our reef-points, we hung over the stick, and gazed down to\nthe one white, bubbling spot, which had closed over the head of our\nshipmate; but the next minute it was brewed into the common yeast of\nthe waves, and Jackson never arose. We waited a few minutes, expecting\nan order to descend, haul back the fore-yard, and man the boat; but\ninstead of that, the next sound that greeted us was, \u201cBear a hand, and\nreef away, men!\u201d from the mate.\nIndeed, upon reflection, it would have been idle to attempt to save\nJackson; for besides that he must have been dead, ere he struck the\nsea\u2014and if he had not been dead then, the first immersion must have\ndriven his soul from his lacerated lungs\u2014our jolly-boat would have\ntaken full fifteen minutes to launch into the waves.\nAnd here it should be said, that the thoughtless security in which too\nmany sea-captains indulge, would, in case of some sudden disaster\nbefalling the Highlander, have let us all drop into our graves.\nLike most merchant ships, we had but two boats: the longboat and the\njolly-boat. The long boat, by far the largest and stoutest of the two,\nwas permanently bolted down to the deck, by iron bars attached to its\nsides. It was almost as much of a fixture as the vessel\u2019s keel. It was\nfilled with pigs, fowls, firewood, and coals. Over this the jolly-boat\nwas capsized without a _thole-pin_ in the gunwales; its bottom\nbleaching and cracking in the sun.\nJudge, then, what promise of salvation for us, had we shipwrecked; yet\nin this state, one merchant ship out of three, keeps its boats. To be\nsure, no vessel full of emigrants, by any possible precautions, could\nin case of a fatal disaster at sea, hope to save the tenth part of the\nsouls on board; yet provision should certainly be made for a handful of\nsurvivors, to carry home the tidings of her loss; for even in the worst\nof the calamities that befell patient Job, some _one_ at least of his\nservants escaped to report it.\nIn a way that I never could fully account for, the sailors, in my\nhearing at least, and Harry\u2019s, never made the slightest allusion to the\ndeparted Jackson. One and all they seemed tacitly to unite in hushing\nup his memory among them. Whether it was, that the severity of the\nbondage under which this man held every one of them, did really corrode\nin their secret hearts, that they thought to repress the recollection\nof a thing so degrading, I can not determine; but certain it was, that\n_his_ death was _their_ deliverance; which they celebrated by an\nelevation of spirits, unknown before. Doubtless, this was to be in part\nimputed, however, to their now drawing near to their port.\nCHAPTER LX.\nHOME AT LAST\nNext day was Sunday; and the mid-day sun shone upon a glassy sea.\nAfter the uproar of the breeze and the gale, this profound, pervading\ncalm seemed suited to the tranquil spirit of a day, which, in godly\ntowns, makes quiet vistas of the most tumultuous thoroughfares.\nThe ship lay gently rolling in the soft, subdued ocean swell; while all\naround were faint white spots; and nearer to, broad, milky patches,\nbetokening the vicinity of scores of ships, all bound to one common\nport, and tranced in one common calm. Here the long, devious wakes from\nEurope, Africa, India, and Peru converged to a line, which braided them\nall in one.\nFull before us quivered and danced, in the noon-day heat and mid-air,\nthe green heights of New Jersey; and by an optical delusion, the blue\nsea seemed to flow under them.\nThe sailors whistled and whistled for a wind; the impatient\ncabin-passengers were arrayed in their best; and the emigrants\nclustered around the bows, with eyes intent upon the long-sought land.\nBut leaning over, in a reverie, against the side, my Carlo gazed down\ninto the calm, violet sea, as if it were an eye that answered his own;\nand turning to Harry, said, \u201cThis America\u2019s skies must be down in the\nsea; for, looking down in this water, I behold what, in Italy, we also\nbehold overhead. Ah! after all, I find my Italy somewhere, wherever I\ngo. I even found it in rainy Liverpool.\u201d\nPresently, up came a dainty breeze, wafting to us a white wing from the\nshore\u2014the pilot-boat! Soon a monkey-jacket mounted the side, and was\nbeset by the captain and cabin people for news. And out of bottomless\npockets came bundles of newspapers, which were eagerly caught by the\nthrong.\nThe captain now abdicated in the pilot\u2019s favor, who proved to be a\ntiger of a fellow, keeping us hard at work, pulling and hauling the\nbraces, and trimming the ship, to catch the least _cat\u2019s-paw_ of wind.\nWhen, among sea-worn people, a strange man from shore suddenly stands\namong them, with the smell of the land in his beard, it conveys a\nrealization of the vicinity of the green grass, that not even the\ndistant sight of the shore itself can transcend.\nThe steerage was now as a bedlam; trunks and chests were locked and\ntied round with ropes; and a general washing and rinsing of faces and\nhands was beheld. While this was going on, forth came an order from the\nquarter-deck, for every bed, blanket, bolster, and bundle of straw in\nthe steerage to be committed to the deep.\u2014A command that was received\nby the emigrants with dismay, and then with wrath. But they were\nassured, that this was indispensable to the getting rid of an otherwise\nlong detention of some weeks at the quarantine. They therefore\nreluctantly complied; and overboard went pallet and pillow. Following\nthem, went old pots and pans, bottles and baskets. So, all around, the\nsea was strewn with stuffed bed-ticks, that limberly floated on the\nwaves\u2014couches for all mermaids who were not fastidious. Numberless\nthings of this sort, tossed overboard from emigrant ships nearing the\nharbor of New York, drift in through the Narrows, and are deposited on\nthe shores of Staten Island; along whose eastern beach I have often\nwalked, and speculated upon the broken jugs, torn pillows, and\ndilapidated baskets at my feet.\nA second order was now passed for the emigrants to muster their forces,\nand give the steerage a final, thorough cleaning with sand and water.\nAnd to this they were incited by the same warning which had induced\nthem to make an offering to Neptune of their bedding. The place was\nthen fumigated, and dried with pans of coals from the galley; so that\nby evening, no stranger would have imagined, from her appearance, that\nthe Highlander had made otherwise than a tidy and prosperous voyage.\nThus, some sea-captains take good heed that benevolent citizens shall\nnot get a glimpse of the true condition of the steerage while at sea.\nThat night it again fell calm; but next morning, though the wind was\nsomewhat against us, we set sail for the Narrows; and making short\ntacks, at last ran through, almost bringing our jib-boom over one of\nthe forts.\nAn early shower had refreshed the woods and fields, that glowed with a\nglorious green; and to our salted lungs, the land breeze was spiced\nwith aromas. The steerage passengers almost neighed with delight, like\nhorses brought back to spring pastures; and every eye and ear in the\nHighlander was full of the glad sights and sounds of the shore.\nNo more did we think of the gale and the plague; nor turn our eyes\nupward to the stains of blood, still visible on the topsail, whence\nJackson had fallen; but we fixed our gaze on the orchards and meads,\nand like thirsty men, drank in all their dew.\nOn the Staten Island side, a white staff displayed a pale yellow flag,\ndenoting the habitation of the quarantine officer; for as if to\nsymbolize the yellow fever itself, and strike a panic and premonition\nof the black vomit into every beholder, all quarantines all over the\nworld, taint the air with the streamings of their fever-flag.\nBut though the long rows of white-washed hospitals on the hill side\nwere now in plain sight, and though scores of ships were here lying at\nanchor, yet no boat came off to us; and to our surprise and delight, on\nwe sailed, past a spot which every one had dreaded. How it was that\nthey thus let us pass without boarding us, we never could learn.\nNow rose the city from out the bay, and one by one, her spires pierced\nthe blue; while thick and more thick, ships, brigs, schooners, and sail\nboats, thronged around. We saw the Hartz Forest of masts and black\nrigging stretching along the East River; and northward, up the stately\nold Hudson, covered with white sloop-sails like fleets of swans, we\ncaught a far glimpse of the purple Palisades.\nOh! he who has never been afar, let him once go from home, to know what\nhome is. For as you draw nigh again to your old native river, he seems\nto pour through you with all his tides, and in your enthusiasm, you\nswear to build altars like mile-stones, along both his sacred banks.\nLike the Czar of all the Russias, and Siberia to boot, Captain Riga,\ntelescope in hand, stood on the poop, pointing out to the passengers,\nGovernor\u2019s Island, Castle Garden, and the Battery.\n\u201cAnd _that\u201d_ said he, pointing out a vast black hull which, like a\nshark, showed tiers of teeth, _\u201cthat,_ ladies, is a\nline-of-battle-ship, the North Carolina.\u201d\n\u201cOh, dear!\u201d\u2014and \u201cOh my!\u201d\u2014ejaculated the ladies, and\u2014 \u201cLord, save us,\u201d\nresponded an old gentleman, who was a member of the Peace Society.\nHurra! hurra! and ten thousand times hurra! down goes our old anchor,\nfathoms down into the free and independent Yankee mud, one handful of\nwhich was now worth a broad manor in England.\nThe Whitehall boats were around us, and soon, our cabin passengers were\nall off, gay as crickets, and bound for a late dinner at the Astor\nHouse; where, no doubt, they fired off a salute of champagne corks in\nhonor of their own arrival. Only a very few of the steerage passengers,\nhowever, could afford to pay the high price the watermen demanded for\ncarrying them ashore; so most of them remained with us till morning.\nBut nothing could restrain our Italian boy, Carlo, who, promising the\nwatermen to pay them with his music, was triumphantly rowed ashore,\nseated in the stern of the boat, his organ before him, and something\nlike \u201cHail Columbia!\u201d his tune. We gave him three rapturous cheers, and\nwe never saw Carlo again.\nHarry and I passed the greater part of the night walking the deck, and\ngazing at the thousand lights of the city.\nAt sunrise, we _warped_ into a berth at the foot of Wall-street, and\nknotted our old ship, stem and stern, to the pier. But that knotting of\n_her,_ was the unknotting of the bonds of the sailors, among whom, it\nis a maxim, that the ship once fast to the wharf, they are free. So\nwith a rush and a shout, they bounded ashore, followed by the\ntumultuous crowd of emigrants, whose friends, day-laborers and\nhousemaids, stood ready to embrace them.\nBut in silent gratitude at the end of a voyage, almost equally\nuncongenial to both of us, and so bitter to one, Harry and I sat on a\nchest in the forecastle. And now, the ship that we had loathed, grew\nlovely in our eyes, which lingered over every familiar old timber; for\nthe scene of suffering is a scene of joy when the suffering is past;\nand the silent reminiscence of hardships departed, is sweeter than the\npresence of delight.\nCHAPTER LXI.\nREDBURN AND HARRY, ARM IN ARM, IN HARBOR\nThere we sat in that tarry old den, the only inhabitants of the\ndeserted old ship, but the mate and the rats.\nAt last, Harry went to his chest, and drawing out a few shillings,\nproposed that we should go ashore, and return with a supper, to eat in\nthe forecastle. Little else that was eatable being for sale in the\npaltry shops along the wharves, we bought several pies, some doughnuts,\nand a bottle of ginger-pop, and thus supplied we made merry. For to us,\nwhose very mouths were become pickled and puckered, with the continual\nflavor of briny beef, those pies and doughnuts were most delicious. And\nas for the ginger-pop, why, that ginger-pop was divine! I have\nreverenced ginger-pop ever since.\nWe kept late hours that night; for, delightful certainty! placed beyond\nall doubt\u2014like royal landsmen, we were masters of the watches of the\nnight, and no _starb-o-leens ahoy!_ would annoy us again.\n\u201cAll night in! think of _that,_ Harry, my friend!\u201d\n\u201cAy, Wellingborough, it\u2019s enough to keep me awake forever, to think I\nmay now sleep as long as I please.\u201d\nWe turned out bright and early, and then prepared for the shore, first\nstripping to the waist, for a toilet.\n\u201cI shall never get these confounded tar-stains out of my fingers,\u201d\ncried Harry, rubbing them hard with a bit of oakum, steeped in strong\nsuds. \u201cNo! they will _not_ come out, and I\u2019m ruined for life. Look at\nmy hand once, Wellingborough!\u201d\nIt was indeed a sad sight. Every finger nail, like mine, was dyed of a\nrich, russet hue; looking something like bits of fine tortoise shell.\n\u201cNever mind, Harry,\u201d said I\u2014\u201cYou know the ladies of the east steep the\ntips of their fingers in some golden dye.\u201d\n\u201cAnd by Plutus,\u201d cried Harry\u2014\u201cI\u2019d steep mine up to the armpits in gold;\nsince you talk about _that._ But never mind, I\u2019ll swear I\u2019m just from\nPersia, my boy.\u201d\nWe now arrayed ourselves in our best, and sallied ashore; and, at once,\nI piloted Harry to the sign of a Turkey Cock in Fulton-street, kept by\none Sweeny, a place famous for cheap Souchong, and capital buckwheat\ncakes.\n\u201cWell, gentlemen, what will you have?\u201d\u2014said a waiter, as we seated\nourselves at a table.\n\u201c_Gentlemen!_\u201d whispered Harry to me\u2014\u201c_gentlemen!_\u2014hear him!\u2014I say now,\nRedburn, they didn\u2019t talk to us that way on board the old Highlander.\nBy heaven, I begin to feel my straps again:\u2014Coffee and hot rolls,\u201d he\nadded aloud, crossing his legs like a lord, \u201cand fellow\u2014come back\u2014bring\nus a venison-steak.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t got it, gentlemen.\u201d\n\u201cHam and eggs,\u201d suggested I, whose mouth was watering at the\nrecollection of that particular dish, which I had tasted at the sign of\nthe Turkey Cock before. So ham and eggs it was; and royal coffee, and\nimperial toast.\nBut the butter!\n\u201cHarry, did you ever taste such butter as this before?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say a word,\u201d\u2014said Harry, spreading his tenth slice of toast \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to turn dairyman, and keep within the blessed savor of butter, so\nlong as I live.\u201d\nWe made a breakfast, never to be forgotten; paid our bill with a\nflourish, and sallied into the street, like two goodly galleons of\ngold, bound from Acapulco to Old Spain.\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Harry, \u201clead on; and let\u2019s see something of these United\nStates of yours. I\u2019m ready to pace from Maine to Florida; ford the\nGreat Lakes; and jump the River Ohio, if it comes in the way. Here,\ntake my arm;\u2014lead on.\u201d\nSuch was the miraculous change, that had now come over him. It reminded\nme of his manner, when we had started for London, from the sign of the\nGolden Anchor, in Liverpool.\nHe was, indeed, in most wonderful spirits; at which I could not help\nmarveling; considering the cavity in his pockets; and that he was a\nstranger in the land.\nBy noon he had selected his boarding-house, a private establishment,\nwhere they did not charge much for their board, and where the\nlandlady\u2019s butcher\u2019s bill was not very large.\nHere, at last, I left him to get his chest from the ship; while I\nturned up town to see my old friend Mr. Jones, and learn what had\nhappened during my absence.\nWith one hand, Mr. Jones shook mine most cordially; and with the other,\ngave me some letters, which I eagerly devoured. Their purport compelled\nmy departure homeward; and I at once sought out Harry to inform him.\nStrange, but even the few hours\u2019 absence which had intervened; during\nwhich, Harry had been left to himself, to stare at strange streets, and\nstrange faces, had wrought a marked change in his countenance. He was a\ncreature of the suddenest impulses. Left to himself, the strange\nstreets seemed now to have reminded him of his friendless condition;\nand I found him with a very sad eye; and his right hand groping in his\npocket.\n\u201cWhere am I going to dine, this day week?\u201d\u2014he slowly said. \u201cWhat\u2019s to\nbe done, Wellingborough?\u201d\nAnd when I told him that the next afternoon I must leave him; he looked\ndownhearted enough. But I cheered him as well as I could; though\nneeding a little cheering myself; even though I _had_ got home again.\nBut no more about that.\nNow, there was a young man of my acquaintance in the city, much my\nsenior, by the name of Goodwell; and a good natured fellow he was; who\nhad of late been engaged as a clerk in a large forwarding house in\nSouth-street; and it occurred to me, that he was just the man to\nbefriend Harry, and procure him a place. So I mentioned the thing to my\ncomrade; and we called upon Goodwell.\nI saw that he was impressed by the handsome exterior of my friend; and\nin private, making known the case, he faithfully promised to do his\nbest for him; though the times, he said, were quite dull.\nThat evening, Goodwell, Harry, and I, perambulated the streets, three\nabreast:\u2014Goodwell spending his money freely at the oyster-saloons;\nHarry full of allusions to the London Clubhouses: and myself\ncontributing a small quota to the general entertainment.\nNext morning, we proceeded to business.\nNow, I did not expect to draw much of a salary from the ship; so as to\nretire for life on the profits of _my first voyage;_ but nevertheless,\nI thought that a dollar or two might be coming. For dollars are\nvaluable things; and should not be overlooked, when they are owing.\nTherefore, as the second morning after our arrival, had been set apart\nfor paying off the crew, Harry and I made our appearance on ship-board,\nwith the rest. We were told to enter the cabin; and once again I found\nmyself, after an interval of four months, and more, surrounded by its\nmahogany and maple.\nSeated in a sumptuous arm-chair, behind a lustrous, inlaid desk, sat\nCaptain Riga, arrayed in his City Hotel suit, looking magisterial as\nthe Lord High Admiral of England. Hat in hand, the sailors stood\ndeferentially in a semicircle before him, while the captain held the\nship-papers in his hand, and one by one called their names; and in\nmellow bank notes\u2014beautiful sight!\u2014paid them their wages.\nMost of them had less than ten, a few twenty, and two, thirty dollars\ncoming to them; while the old cook, whose piety proved profitable in\nrestraining him from the expensive excesses of most seafaring men, and\nwho had taken no pay in advance, had the goodly round sum of seventy\ndollars as his due.\nSeven ten dollar bills! each of which, as I calculated at the time, was\nworth precisely one hundred dimes, which were equal to one thousand\ncents, which were again subdivisible into fractions. So that he now\nstepped into a fortune of seventy thousand American _\u201cmitts.\u201d_ Only\nseventy dollars, after all; but then, it has always seemed to me, that\nstating amounts in sounding fractional sums, conveys a much fuller\nnotion of their magnitude, than by disguising their immensity in such\naggregations of value, as doubloons, sovereigns, and dollars. Who would\nnot rather be worth 125,000 francs in Paris, than only \u00a35000 in London,\nthough the intrinsic value of the two sums, in round numbers, is pretty\nmuch the same.\nWith a scrape of the foot, and such a bow as only a negro can make, the\nold cook marched off with his fortune; and I have no doubt at once\ninvested it in a grand, underground oyster-cellar.\nThe other sailors, after counting their cash very carefully, and seeing\nall was right, and not a bank-note was dog-eared, in which case they\nwould have demanded another: for they are not to be taken in and\ncheated, your sailors, and they know their rights, too; at least, when\nthey are at liberty, after the voyage is concluded:\u2014 the sailors also\nsalaamed, and withdrew, leaving Harry and me face to face with the\nPaymaster-general of the Forces.\nWe stood awhile, looking as polite as possible, and expecting every\nmoment to hear our names called, but not a word did we hear; while the\ncaptain, throwing aside his accounts, lighted a very fragrant cigar,\ntook up the morning paper\u2014I think it was the Herald\u2014threw his leg over\none arm of the chair, and plunged into the latest intelligence from all\nparts of the world.\nI looked at Harry, and he looked at me; and then we both looked at this\nincomprehensible captain.\nAt last Harry hemmed, and I scraped my foot to increase the\ndisturbance.\nThe Paymaster-general looked up.\n\u201cWell, where do you come from? Who are _you,_ pray? and what do you\nwant? Steward, show these young gentlemen out.\u201d\n\u201cI want my money,\u201d said Harry.\n\u201cMy wages are due,\u201d said I.\nThe captain laughed. Oh! he was exceedingly merry; and taking a long\ninspiration of smoke, removed his cigar, and sat sideways looking at\nus, letting the vapor slowly wriggle and spiralize out of his mouth.\n\u201cUpon my soul, young gentlemen, you astonish me. Are your names down in\nthe City Directory? have you any letters of introduction, young\ngentlemen?\u201d\n\u201cCaptain Riga!\u201d cried Harry, enraged at his impudence\u2014\u201cI tell you what\nit is, Captain Riga; this won\u2019t do\u2014where\u2019s the rhino?\u201d\n\u201cCaptain Riga,\u201d added I, \u201cdo you not remember, that about four months\nago, my friend Mr. Jones and myself had an interview with you in this\nvery cabin; when it was agreed that I was to go out in your ship, and\nreceive three dollars per month for my services? Well, Captain Riga, I\nhave gone out with you, and returned; and now, sir, I\u2019ll thank you for\nmy pay.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes, I remember,\u201d said the captain. _\u201cMr. Jones!_ Ha! ha! I\nremember Mr. Jones: a very gentlemanly gentleman; and stop\u2014_you,_ too,\nare the son of a wealthy French importer; and\u2014let me think\u2014was not your\ngreat-uncle a barber?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d thundered I.\n\u201cWell, well, young gentleman, really I beg your pardon. Steward, chairs\nfor the young gentlemen\u2014be seated, young gentlemen. And now, let me\nsee,\u201d turning over his accounts\u2014 \u201cHum, hum!\u2014yes, here it is:\nWellingborough Redburn, at three dollars a month. Say four months,\nthat\u2019s twelve dollars; less three dollars advanced in Liverpool\u2014that\nmakes it nine dollars; less three hammers and two scrapers lost\noverboard\u2014 that brings it to four dollars and a quarter. I owe you four\ndollars and a quarter, I believe, young gentleman?\u201d\n\u201cSo it seems, sir,\u201d said I, with staring eyes.\n\u201cAnd now let me see what you owe me, and then well be able to square\nthe yards, Monsieur Redburn.\u201d\nOwe _him!_ thought I\u2014what do I owe him but a grudge, but I concealed my\nresentment; and presently he said, \u201cBy running away from the ship in\nLiverpool, you forfeited your wages, which amount to twelve dollars;\nand as there has been advanced to you, in money, hammers, and scrapers,\nseven dollars and seventy-five cents, you are therefore indebted to me\nin precisely that sum. Now, young gentleman, I\u2019ll thank you for the\nmoney;\u201d and he extended his open palm across the desk.\n\u201cShall I pitch into him?\u201d whispered Harry.\nI was thunderstruck at this most unforeseen announcement of the state\nof my account with Captain Riga; and I began to understand why it was\nthat he had till now ignored my absence from the ship, when Harry and I\nwere in London. But a single minute\u2019s consideration showed that I could\nnot help myself; so, telling him that he was at liberty to begin his\nsuit, for I was a bankrupt, and could not pay him, I turned to go.\nNow, here was this man actually turning a poor lad adrift without a\ncopper, after he had been slaving aboard his ship for more than four\nmortal months. But Captain Riga was a bachelor of expensive habits, and\nhad run up large wine bills at the City Hotel. He could not afford to\nbe munificent. Peace to his dinners.\n\u201cMr. Bolton, I believe,\u201d said the captain, now blandly bowing toward\nHarry. \u201cMr. Bolton, _you_ also shipped for three dollars per month: and\nyou had one month\u2019s advance in Liverpool; and from dock to dock we have\nbeen about a month and a half; so I owe you just one dollar and a half,\nMr. Bolton; and here it is;\u201d handing him six two-shilling pieces.\n\u201cAnd this,\u201d said Harry, throwing himself into a tragical attitude,\n_\u201cthis_ is the reward of my long and faithful services!\u201d\nThen, disdainfully flinging the silver on the desk, he exclaimed,\n\u201cThere, Captain Riga, you may keep your tin! It has been in _your_\npurse, and it would give me the itch to retain it. Good morning, sir.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning, young gentlemen; pray, call again,\u201d said the captain,\ncoolly bagging the coins. His politeness, while in port, was\ninvincible.\nQuitting the cabin, I remonstrated with Harry upon his recklessness in\ndisdaining his wages, small though they were; I begged to remind him of\nhis situation; and hinted that every penny he could get might prove\nprecious to him. But he only cried _Pshaw!_ and that was the last of\nit.\nGoing forward, we found the sailors congregated on the forecastle-deck,\nengaged in some earnest discussion; while several carts on the wharf,\nloaded with their chests, were just in the act of driving off, destined\nfor the boarding-houses uptown. By the looks of our shipmates, I saw\nvery plainly that they must have some mischief under weigh; and so it\nturned out.\nNow, though Captain Riga had not been guilty of any particular outrage\nagainst the sailors; yet, by a thousand small meannesses\u2014such as\nindirectly causing their allowance of bread and beef to be diminished,\nwithout betraying any appearance of having any inclination that way,\nand without speaking to the sailors on the subject\u2014by this, and kindred\nactions, I say, he had contracted the cordial dislike of the whole\nship\u2019s company; and long since they had bestowed upon him a name\nunmentionably expressive of their contempt.\nThe voyage was now concluded; and it appeared that the subject being\ndebated by the assembly on the forecastle was, how best they might give\na united and valedictory expression of the sentiments they entertained\ntoward their late lord and master. Some emphatic symbol of those\nsentiments was desired; some unmistakable token, which should forcibly\nimpress Captain Riga with the justest possible notion of their\nfeelings.\nIt was like a meeting of the members of some mercantile company, upon\nthe eve of a prosperous dissolution of the concern; when the\nsubordinates, actuated by the purest gratitude toward their president,\nor chief, proceed to vote him a silver pitcher, in token of their\nrespect. It was something like this, I repeat\u2014but with a material\ndifference, as will be seen.\nAt last, the precise manner in which the thing should be done being\nagreed upon, Blunt, the \u201cIrish cockney,\u201d was deputed to summon the\ncaptain. He knocked at the cabin-door, and politely requested the\nsteward to inform Captain Riga, that some gentlemen were on the\npier-head, earnestly seeking him; whereupon he joined his comrades.\nIn a few moments the captain sallied from the cabin, and found the\n_gentlemen_ alluded to, strung along the top of the bulwarks, on the\nside next to the wharf. Upon his appearance, the row suddenly wheeled\nabout, presenting their backs; and making a motion, which was a polite\nsalute to every thing before them, but an abominable insult to all who\nhappened to be in their rear, they gave three cheers, and at one bound,\ncleared the ship.\nTrue to his imperturbable politeness while in port, Captain Riga only\nlifted his hat, smiled very blandly, and slowly returned into his\ncabin.\nWishing to see the last movements of this remarkable crew, who were so\nclever ashore and so craven afloat, Harry and I followed them along the\nwharf, till they stopped at a sailor retreat, poetically denominated\n\u201cThe Flashes.\u201d And here they all came to anchor before the bar; and the\nlandlord, a lantern-jawed landlord, bestirred himself behind it, among\nhis villainous old bottles and decanters. He well knew, from their\nlooks, that his customers were \u201cflush,\u201d and would spend their money\nfreely, as, indeed, is the case with most seamen, recently paid off.\nIt was a touching scene.\n\u201cWell, maties,\u201d said one of them, at last\u2014\u201cI spose we shan\u2019t see each\nother again:\u2014come, let\u2019s splice the main-brace all round, and drink to\n_the last voyage!\u201d_\nUpon this, the landlord danced down his glasses, on the bar, uncorked\nhis decanters, and deferentially pushed them over toward the sailors,\nas much as to say\u2014_\u201cHonorable gentlemen, it is not for me to allowance\nyour liquor;\u2014help yourselves, your honors.\u201d_\nAnd so they did; each glass a bumper; and standing in a row, tossed\nthem all off; shook hands all round, three times three; and then\ndisappeared in couples, through the several doorways; for _\u201cThe\nFlashes\u201d_ was on a corner.\nIf to every one, life be made up of farewells and greetings, and a\n_\u201cGood-by, God bless you,\u201d_ is heard for every _\u201cHow d\u2019ye do, welcome,\nmy boy\u201d\u2014_then, of all men, sailors shake the most hands, and wave the\nmost hats. They are here and then they are there; ever shifting\nthemselves, they shift among the shifting: and like rootless sea-weed,\nare tossed to and fro.\nAs, after shaking our hands, our shipmates departed, Harry and I stood\non the corner awhile, till we saw the last man disappear.\n\u201cThey are gone,\u201d said I.\n\u201cThank heaven!\u201d said Harry.\nCHAPTER LXII.\nTHE LAST THAT WAS EVER HEARD OF HARRY BOLTON\nThat same afternoon, I took my comrade down to the Battery; and we sat\non one of the benches, under the summer shade of the trees.\nIt was a quiet, beautiful scene; full of promenading ladies and\ngentlemen; and through the foliage, so fresh and bright, we looked out\nover the bay, varied with glancing ships; and then, we looked down to\nour boots; and thought what a fine world it would be, if we only had a\nlittle money to enjoy it. But that\u2019s the everlasting rub\u2014oh, who can\ncure an empty pocket?\n\u201cI have no doubt, Goodwell will take care of you, Harry,\u201d said I, \u201che\u2019s\na fine, good-hearted fellow; and will do his best for you, I know.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt of it,\u201d said Harry, looking hopeless.\n\u201cAnd I need not tell you, Harry, how sorry I am to leave you so soon.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I am sorry enough myself,\u201d said Harry, looking very sincere.\n\u201cBut I will be soon back again, I doubt not,\u201d said I.\n\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cHow far is it off?\u201d\n\u201cOnly a hundred and eighty miles,\u201d said I.\n\u201cA hundred and eighty miles!\u201d said Harry, drawing the words out like an\nendless ribbon. \u201cWhy, I couldn\u2019t walk that in a month.\u201d\n\u201cNow, my dear friend,\u201d said I, \u201ctake my advice, and while I am gone,\nkeep up a stout heart; never despair, and all will be well.\u201d\nBut notwithstanding all I could say to encourage him, Harry felt so\nbad, that nothing would do, but a rush to a neighboring bar, where we\nboth gulped down a glass of ginger-pop; after which we felt better.\nHe accompanied me to the steamboat, that was to carry me homeward; he\nstuck close to my side, till she was about to put off; then, standing\non the wharf, he shook me by the hand, till we almost counteracted the\nplay of the paddles; and at last, with a mutual jerk at the arm-pits,\nwe parted. I never saw Harry again.\nI pass over the reception I met with at home; how I plunged into\nembraces, long and loving:\u2014I pass over this; and will conclude _my\nfirst voyage_ by relating all I know of what overtook Harry Bolton.\nCircumstances beyond my control, detained me at home for several weeks;\nduring which, I wrote to my friend, without receiving an answer.\nI then wrote to young Goodwell, who returned me the following letter,\nnow spread before me.\n_\u201cDear Redburn\u2014Your poor friend, Harry, I can not find any where. After\nyou left, he called upon me several times, and we walked out together;\nand my interest in him increased every day. But you don\u2019t know how dull\nare the times here, and what multitudes of young men, well qualified,\nare seeking employment in counting-houses. I did my best; but could not\nget Harry a place. However, I cheered him. But he grew more and more\nmelancholy, and at last told me, that he had sold all his clothes but\nthose on his back to pay his board. I offered to loan him a few\ndollars, but he would not receive them. I called upon him two or three\ntimes after this, but he was not in; at last, his landlady told me that\nhe had permanently left her house the very day before. Upon my\nquestioning her closely, as to where he had gone, she answered, that\nshe did not know, but from certain hints that had dropped from our poor\nfriend, she feared he had gone on a whaling voyage. I at once went to\nthe offices in South-street, where men are shipped for the Nantucket\nwhalers, and made inquiries among them; but without success. And this,_\nI _am heartily grieved to say, is all I know of our friend. I can not\nbelieve that his melancholy could bring him to the insanity of throwing\nhimself away in a whaler; and I still think, that he must be somewhere\nin the city. You must come down yourself, and help me seek him out.\u201d_\nThis letter gave me a dreadful shock. Remembering our adventure in\nLondon, and his conduct there; remembering how liable he was to yield\nto the most sudden, crazy, and contrary impulses; and that, as a\nfriendless, penniless foreigner in New York, he must have had the most\nterrible incitements to committing violence upon himself; I shuddered\nto think, that even now, while I thought of him, he might no more be\nliving. So strong was this impression at the time, that I quickly\nglanced over the papers to see if there were any accounts of suicides,\nor drowned persons floating in the harbor of New York.\nI now made all the haste I could to the seaport, but though I sought\nhim all over, no tidings whatever could be heard.\nTo relieve my anxiety, Goodwell endeavored to assure me, that Harry\nmust indeed have departed on a whaling voyage. But remembering his\nbitter experience on board of the Highlander, and more than all, his\nnervousness about going aloft, it seemed next to impossible.\nAt last I was forced to give him up.\nYears after this, I found myself a sailor in the Pacific, on board of a\nwhaler. One day at sea, we spoke another whaler, and the boat\u2019s crew\nthat boarded our vessel, came forward among us to have a little\nsea-chat, as is always customary upon such occasions.\nAmong the strangers was an Englishman, who had shipped in his vessel at\nCallao, for the cruise. In the course of conversation, he made allusion\nto the fact, that he had now been in the Pacific several years, and\nthat the good craft Huntress of Nantucket had had the honor of\noriginally bringing him round upon that side of the globe. I asked him\nwhy he had abandoned her; he answered that she was the most unlucky of\nships.\n\u201cWe had hardly been out three months,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen on the Brazil\nbanks we lost a boat\u2019s crew, chasing a whale after sundown; and next\nday lost a poor little fellow, a countryman of mine, who had never\nentered the boats; he fell over the side, and was jammed between the\nship, and a whale, while we were cutting the fish in. Poor fellow, he\nhad a hard time of it, from the beginning; he was a gentleman\u2019s son,\nand when you could coax him to it, he sang like a bird.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d said I, trembling with expectation; \u201cwhat kind of\neyes did he have? what was the color of his hair?\u201d\n\u201cHarry Bolton was not your brother?\u201d cried the stranger, starting.\n_Harry Bolton!_ it was even he!\nBut yet, I, Wellingborough Redburn, chance to survive, after having\npassed through far more perilous scenes than any narrated in this, _My\nFirst Voyage_\u2014which here I end.\n--- VOLUME 2 ---\nProduced by Pawel Sobkowiak and Polska Biblioteka Internetowa\nBRUNO SCHULZ SKLEPY CYNAMONOWE\nSpis tresci:\nSIERPIE\u0143  NAWIEDZENIE PTAKI MANEKINY  TRAKTAT O MANEKINACH ALBO WT\u00d3RA\nKSI\u0118GA RODZAJU  TRAKTAT O MANEKINACH Ci\u0105g dalszy  TRAKTAT O MANEKINACH\nDoko\u0144czenie  NEMROD  PAN  PAN KAROL  SKLEPY CYNAMONOWE   ULICA KROKODYLI\nKARAKONY  WICHURA  NOC WIELKIEGO SEZONU\nSIERPIE\u0143\n1\nW lipcu ojciec m\u00f3j wyje\u017cd\u017ca\u0142 do w\u00f3d i zostawia\u0142 mnie z matk\u0105 i\nstarszym bratem na pastw\u0119 bia\u0142ych od \u017caru i oszo\u0142amiaj\u0105cych dni letnich.\nWertowali\u009c\u015bmy, odurzeni \u009c\u015bwiat\u0142em, w tej wielkiej ksi\u0119dze wakacji, kt\u00f3rej\nwszystkie karty pa\u0142a\u0142y od blasku i mia\u0142y na dnie s\u0142odki do omdlenia\nmi\u0105\u017csz z\u0142otych gruszek.

Nie wierzy\u0142 jeszcze i odrzuca\u0142 jak absurd te uroszczenia, te\npropozycje, kt\u00f3re na\u0144 napiera\u0142y.

Wkr\u00f3tce okaza\u0142a si\u0119 bowiem konieczna translokacja ojca do dw\u00f3ch\npokoj\u00f3w na poddaszu, kt\u00f3re s\u0142u\u017cy\u0142y za rupieciarnie.

Tak\nstracili\u015b\u009cmy ojca z widoku na przeci\u0105g kilku tygodni. Rzadko tylko\nschodzi\u0142 do mieszkania i wtedy mogli\u009c\u015bmy zauwa\u017cy\u0107, \u017ce zmniejszy\u0142 si\u0119\njakoby, schud\u0142 i skurczy\u0142.

Pewnego razu\nw okresie generalnych porz\u0105dk\u00f3w zjawi\u0142a si\u0119 niespodzianie Adela w\npa\u0144stwie ptasim ojca.

W interesie ciekawego i wa\u017cnego\neksperymentu mo\u017ce ono nawet stanowi\u0107 zas\u0142ug\u0119. Tu jest punkt wyj\u009c\u015bcia dla\nnowej apologii sadyzmu. M\u00f3j ojciec by\u0142 niewyczerpany w gloryfikacji tego\nprzedziwnego elementu, jakim by\u0142a materia. - Nie ma materii martwej -\nnaucza\u0142 - martwota jest jedynie pozorem, za kt\u00f3rym ukrywaj\u0105 si\u0119 nieznane\nformy \u017cycia. Skala tych form jest niesko\u0144czona, a odcienie i niuanse\nniewyczerpane. Demiurgos by\u0142 w posiadaniu wa\u017cnych i ciekawych recept\ntw\u00f3rczych. Dzi\u0119ki nim stworzy\u0142 on mnogo\u009c\u015b\u0107 rodzaj\u00f3w, odnawiaj\u0105cych si\u0119\nw\u0142asn\u0105 si\u0142\u0105. Nie wiadomo, czy recepty te kiedykolwiek zostan\u0105\nzrekonstruowane. Ale jest to niepotrzebne, gdy\u017c je\u015b\u009cliby nawet te\nklasyczne metody kreacji okaza\u0142y si\u0119 raz na zawsze niedost\u0119pne,\npozostaj\u0105 pewne metody illegalne, ca\u0142y bezmiar metod heretyckich i\nwyst\u0119pnych. W miar\u0119 jak ojciec od tych og\u00f3lnych zasad kosmogonii zbli\u017ca\u0142\nsi\u0119 do terenu swych cia\u009c\u015bniejszych zainteresowa\u0144, g\u0142os jego zni\u017ca\u0142 si\u0119 do\nwnikliwego szeptu, wyk\u0142ad stawa\u0142 si\u0119 coraz trudniejszy i zawilszy, a\nwyniki, do kt\u00f3rych dochodzi\u0142, gubi\u0142y si\u0119 w coraz bardziej w\u0105tpliwych i\nryzykownych regionach.

Wy\u0142\u0105czne opanowanie\nobrazem macierzystej prajedni ust\u0119puje urokowi wielo\u015b\u009cci. \u008c\u015awiat zaczyna\nna\u0144 nastawia\u0107 pu\u0142apki: nieznany a czaruj\u0105cy smak r\u00f3\u017cnych pokarm\u00f3w,\nczworobok porannego s\u0142o\u0144ca na pod\u0142odze, na kt\u00f3rym tak dobrze jest\npo\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 si\u0119, ruchy w\u0142asnych cz\u0142onk\u00f3w, w\u0142asne \u0142apki, ogonek, figlarnie\nwyzywaj\u0105cy do zabawy z samym sob\u0105, pieszczoty r\u0119ki ludzkiej, pod kt\u00f3rymi\nzwolna dojrzewa pewna swawolno\u015b\u009c\u0107, weso\u0142o\u015b\u009c\u0107 rozpieraj\u0105ca cia\u0142o i rodz\u0105ca\npotrzeb\u0119 zgo\u0142a nowych, gwa\u0142townych i ryzykownych ruch\u00f3w - wszystko to\nprzekupuje, przekonywa i zach\u0119ca do przyj\u0119cia, do pogodzenia si\u0119 z\neksperymentem \u017cycia. I jeszcze jedno. Nemrod zaczyna rozumie\u0107, \u017ce to, co\nmu si\u0119 tu podsuwa, mimo pozor\u00f3w nowo\u015b\u009cci jest w gruncie rzeczy czym\u015b\u009c, co\nju\u017c by\u0142o - by\u0142o wiele razy - niesko\u0144czenie wiele razy. Jego cia\u0142o\npoznaje sytuacje, wra\u017cenia i przedmioty. W gruncie rzeczy to wszystko\nnie dziwi go zbytnio. W obliczu ka\u017cdej nowej sytuacji daje nura w swoj\u0105\npami\u0119\u0107, w g\u0142\u0119bok\u0105 pami\u0119\u0107 cia\u0142a, i szuka omackiem, gor\u0105czkowo - i bywa,\n\u017ce znajduje w sobie odpowiedni\u0105 reakcj\u0119 ju\u017c gotow\u0105: m\u0105dro\u015b\u0107 pokole\u0144,\nz\u0142o\u017con\u0105 w jego plazmie, w jego nerwach.

Sceneria jego m\u0142odego \u017cycia, kuchnia z wonnymi cebrami, ze\n\u009c\u015bcierkami o skomplikowanej i intryguj\u0105cej woni, z k\u0142apaniem pantofli\nAdeli, z jej ha\u0142a\u015b\u009cliwym krz\u0105taniem si\u0119 - nie straszy go wi\u0119cej. Przywyk\u0142\nuwa\u017ca\u0107 j\u0105 za swoj\u0105 domen\u0119, zadomowi\u0142 si\u0119 w niej i pocz\u0105\u0142 rozwija\u0107 w\nstosunku do niej niejasne poczucie przynale\u017cno\u015b\u009cci, ojczyzny. Chyba \u017ce\nniespodzianie spada\u0142 na\u0144 kataklizm w postaci szorowania pod\u0142ogi -\nobalenie praw natury, chlusty ciep\u0142ego \u0142ugu, podmywaj\u0105ce wszystkie\nmeble, i gro\u017a\u009fny szurgot szczotek Adeli. Ale niebezpiecze\u0144stwo mija,\nszczotka uspokojona i nieruchoma le\u017cy cicho w k\u0105cie, schn\u0105ca pod\u0142oga\npachnie mi\u0142o mokrym drzewem. Nemrod, przywr\u00f3cony znowu do swych\nnormalnych praw i do swobody na terenie w\u0142asnym, czuje \u017cyw\u0105 ochot\u0119\nchwyta\u0107 z\u0119bami stary koc na pod\u0142odze i targa\u0107 nim z ca\u0142ej si\u0142y na prawo\ni lewo. Pacyfikacja \u017cywio\u0142\u00f3w nape\u0142nia go niewymown\u0105 rado\u015b\u009cci\u0105. Wtem staje\njak wryty: przed nim, o jakie trzy kroki pieskie, posuwa si\u0119 czarna\nmaszkara, potw\u00f3r sun\u0105cy szybko na pr\u0119cikach wielu pogmatwanych n\u00f3g. Do\ng\u0142\u0119bi wstrz\u0105\u009c\u015bni\u0119ty Nemrod posuwa wzrokiem za sko\u009c\u015bnym kursem b\u0142yszcz\u0105cego\nowada, \u015b\u009cledz\u0105c w napi\u0119ciu ten p\u0142aski, bezg\u0142owy i \u015b\u009clepy kad\u0142ub, niesiony\nniesamowit\u0105 ruchliwo\u009cci\u0105 paj\u0119czych n\u00f3g. Co\u009c w nim na ten widok wzbiera,\nco\u009c dojrzewa, p\u0119cznieje, czego sam jeszcze nie rozumie, niby jaki\u009c gniew\nalbo strach, lecz raczej przyjemny i po\u0142\u0105czony z dreszczem si\u0142y,\nsamopoczucia, agresywno\u009c\u015bci. I nagle opada na przednie \u0142apki i wyrzuca z\nsiebie g\u0142os, jeszcze jemu samemu nie znany, obcy, ca\u0142kiem niepodobny do\nzwyk\u0142ego kwilenia. Wyrzuca go z siebie raz, i jeszcze raz, i jeszcze,\ncienkim dyszkantem, kt\u00f3ry si\u0119 co chwila wykoleja. Ale nadaremnie\napostrofuje owada w tym nowym, z nag\u0142ego natchnienia zrodzonym j\u0119zyku. W\nkategoriach umys\u0142u karakoniego nie ma miejsca na t\u0119 tyrad\u0119 i owad odbywa\ndalej sw\u0105 sko\u015b\u009cn\u0105 tur\u0119 ku k\u0105towi pokoju, w\u009c\u015br\u00f3d ruch\u00f3w u\u015b\u009cwi\u0119conych\nodwiecznym karakonim rytua\u0142em. Wszelako uczucia nienawi\u015b\u009cci nie maj\u0105\njeszcze trwa\u0142o\u009c\u015bci i mocy w duszy pieska.

Takich\nkulminacyj zepsucia, takich wymy\u015b\u009clno\u015b\u009cci wyuzdania nie przeczuwali\u009cmy\nnigdy.

Ale i w spalonych rumie\u0144cach, w pikantnych stygmatach\npieprzyk\u00f3w, we wstydliwych znamionach ciemnego puszku zdradza\u0142a si\u0119 rasa\nzapiek\u0142ej, czarnej krwi.

Nikt nas nie\nzatrzymuje. Przez korytarze ksi\u0105\u017cek, pomi\u0119dzy d\u0142ugimi rega\u0142ami czasopism\ni druk\u00f3w wydostajemy si\u0119 ze sklepu i oto jeste\u009cmy w tym miejscu Ulicy\nKrokodylej, gdzie z wyniesionego jej punktu wida\u0107 niemal ca\u0142\u0105 d\u0142ugo\u015b\u009c\u0107\ntego szerokiego traktu a\u017c do dalekich, nie wyko\u0144czonych zabudowa\u0144 dworca\nkolejowego.

Napi\u0119cie pozy, sztuczna powaga maski, ironiczny patos dr\u017cy na\ntym nask\u00f3rku. Ale dalecy jeste\u015b\u009cmy od ch\u0119ci demaskowania widowiska. Wbrew\nlepszej wiedzy czujemy si\u0119 wci\u0105gni\u0119ci w tandetny czar dzielnicy. Zreszt\u0105\nnie brak w obrazie miasta i pewnych cech autoparodii. Rz\u0119dy ma\u0142ych,\nparterowych domk\u00f3w podmiejskich zmieniaj\u0105 si\u0119 z wielopi\u0119trowymi\nkamienicami, kt\u00f3re zbudowane jak z kartonu, s\u0105 konglomeratem szyld\u00f3w,\n\u009c\u015blepych okien biurowych, szklistoszarych wystaw, reklam i numer\u00f3w. Pod\ndomami p\u0142ynie rzeka t\u0142umu. Ulica jest szeroka jak bulwar wielkomiejski,\nale jezdnia, jak place wiejskie, zrobiona jest z ubitej gliny, pe\u0142na\nwyboj\u00f3w, ka\u0142u\u017cy i trawy. Ruch uliczny dzielnicy s\u0142u\u017cy do por\u00f3wna\u0144 w tym\nmie\u009c\u015bcie, mieszka\u0144cy m\u00f3wi\u0105 o nim z dum\u0105 i porozumiewawczym b\u0142yskiem w\noku.

Wszelako, mimo\nzaaferowania i interesowno\u015b\u009cci, ma si\u0119 wra\u017cenie b\u0142\u0119dnej, monotonnej,\nbezcelowej w\u0119dr\u00f3wki, jakiego\u015b\u009c sennego korowodu marionetek. Atmosfera\ndziwnej b\u0142aho\u009c\u015bci przenika t\u0119 ca\u0142\u0105 sceneri\u0119. T\u0142um p\u0142ynie monotonnie i,\nrzecz dziwna, widzi si\u0119 go zawsze jakby niewyra\u017a\u009fnie, figury przep\u0142ywaj\u0105\nw spl\u0105tanym, \u0142agodnym zgie\u0142ku, nie dochodz\u0105c do zupe\u0142nej wyrazisto\u015b\u009cci.\nCzasem tylko wy\u0142awiamy z tego gwaru wielu g\u0142\u00f3w jakie\u009c\u015b ciemne, \u017cywe\nspojrzenie, jaki\u009c\u015b czarny melonik nasuni\u0119ty g\u0142\u0119boko na g\u0142ow\u0119, jakie\u015b\u009c p\u00f3\u0142\ntwarzy rozdarte u\u015b\u009cmiechem, z ustami, kt\u00f3re w\u0142a\u015b\u009cnie co\u015b\u009c powiedzia\u0142y,\njak\u0105\u009c\u015b nog\u0119 wysuni\u0119t\u0105 w kroku i tak ju\u017c zastyg\u0142\u0105 na zawsze.

W tej dzielnicy pozoru i pustego\ngestu nie przywi\u0105zuje si\u0119 zbytniej wagi do \u009c\u015bcis\u0142ego celu jazdy i\npasa\u017cerowie powierzaj\u0105 si\u0119 tym b\u0142\u0119dnym pojazdom z lekkomy\u009clno\u009c\u015bci\u0105, kt\u00f3ra\ncechuje tu wszystko. Nieraz mo\u017cna ich widzie\u0107 na niebezpiecznych\nzakr\u0119tach, wychylonych daleko z po\u0142amanej budy, jak z lejcami w d\u0142oniach\nprzeprowadzaj\u0105 z nat\u0119\u017ceniem trudny manewr wymijania.

Ale po\u017ca\u0142owania godny jest widok tych woz\u00f3w, zrobionych z\npapier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, o \u015bcianach powyginanych i zmi\u0119tych od wieloletniego\nu\u017cytku.

Tramwaje te popychane s\u0105 przez tragarzy miejskich.\nNajdziwniejsz\u0105 atoli rzecz\u0105 jest komunikacja kolejowa na Ulicy\nKrokodylej.

I wreszcie niespodzianie zaje\u017cd\u017ca, ju\u017c\nwjecha\u0142 z bocznej uliczki, sk\u0105d go oczekiwano, niski jak w\u0105\u017c,\nminiaturowy, z ma\u0142\u0105, sapi\u0105c\u0105, kr\u0119p\u0105 lokomotyw\u0105.

Ciemne sapanie parowozu i powiew dziwnej powagi, pe\u0142nej smutku,\nt\u0142umiony po\u009c\u015bpiech i zdenerwowanie zamieniaj\u0105 ulic\u0119 na chwil\u0119 w hal\u0119\ndworca kolejowego w szybko zapadaj\u0105cym zmierzchu zimowym. Plag\u0105 naszego\nmiasta jest a\u017ciota\u017c bilet\u00f3w kolejowych i przekupstwo.

Dalej, za\ndachami rynku, widzia\u0142em dalekie mury ogniowe, nagie \u009c\u015bciany szczytowe\nprzedmie\u015b\u009ccia.

Nie jedli\u009c\u015bmy tego dnia obiadu, bo ogie\u0144 w kuchni\nwraca\u0142 k\u0142\u0119bami dymu do izby.

Przypomnieli\u009c\u015bmy sobie, \u017ce ojca od rana nie\nwidziano. Wczesnym rankiem, domy\u015b\u009clali\u009c\u015bmy si\u0119, musia\u0142 uda\u0107 si\u0119 do sklepu,\ngdzie go zaskoczy\u0142a wichura, odcinaj\u0105c mu powr\u00f3t. - Ca\u0142y dzie\u0144 nic nie\njad\u0142 - biada\u0142a matka.

Zaledwie subiekt i brat m\u00f3j\nz wzd\u0119tymi p\u0142aszczami wkroczyli jedn\u0105 nog\u0105 w ciemno\u015b\u009c\u0107, noc ich po\u0142kn\u0119\u0142a\nzaraz na progu domu. Wicher zmy\u0142 momentalnie \u015b\u009clad ich wyj\u009c\u015bcia. Nie wida\u0107\nby\u0142o przez okno nawet latarki, kt\u00f3r\u0105 ze sob\u0105 zabrali.

Nie\nmogli doj\u009c\u015b\u0107 do sklepu, zgubili drog\u0119 i ledwo trafili z powrotem. Nie\npoznawali miasta, wszystkie ulice by\u0142y jak przestawione.

Written from Palencia in May, 1581, and addressed to Don\nAlonzo Velasquez, Bishop of Osma, who had been when Canon of\nToledo, one of the Saint's Confessors\nIntroduction to the Present Edition.\nWhen the publisher entrusted me with the task of editing this\nvolume, one sheet was already printed and a considerable portion\nof the book was in type.  Under his agreement with the owners of\nthe copyright, he was bound to reproduce the text and notes,\netc., originally prepared by Mr. David Lewis without any change,\nso that my duty was confined to reading the proofs and verifying\nthe quotations.  This translation of the Life of St. Teresa is so\nexcellent, that it could hardly be improved.  While faithfully\nadhering to her wording, the translator has been successful in\nrendering the lofty teaching in simple and clear language, an\nachievement all the more remarkable as in addition to the\ndifficulty arising from the transcendental nature of the subject\nmatter, the involved style, and the total absence of punctuation\ntend to perplex the reader.  Now and then there might be some\ndifference of opinion as to how St. Teresa's phrases should be\nconstrued, but it is not too much to say that on the whole\nMr. Lewis has been more successful than any other translator,\nwhether English or foreign.  Only in one case have I found it\nnecessary to make some slight alteration in the text, and I trust\nthe owners of the copyright will forgive me for doing so.  In\nChapter XXV., \u00a7 4, St. Teresa, speaking of the difference between\nthe Divine and the imaginary locutions, says that a person\ncommending a matter to God with great earnestness, may think that\nhe hears whether his prayer will be granted or not: y es muy\nposible, \"and this is quite possible,\" but he who has ever heard\na Divine locution will see at once that this assurance is\nsomething quite different.  Mr. Lewis, following the old Spanish\neditions, translated \"And it is most impossible,\" whereas both\nthe autograph and the context demand the wording I have ventured\nto substitute.\nWhen Mr. Lewis undertook the translation of St. Teresa's works,\nhe had before him Don Vicente de la Fuente's edition (Madrid,\n1861-1862), supposed to be a faithful transcript of the original.\nIn 1873 the Sociedad Foto-Tipografica-Catolica of Madrid\npublished a photographic reproduction of the Saint's autograph in\n412 pages in folio, which establishes the true text once for all.\nDon Vicente prepared a transcript of this, in which he wisely\nadopted the modern way of spelling but otherwise preserved the\noriginal text, or at least pretended to do so, for a minute\ncomparison between autograph and transcript reveals the startling\nfact that nearly a thousand inaccuracies have been allowed to\ncreep in.  Most of these variants are immaterial, but there are\nsome which ought not to have been overlooked. Thus, in Chapter\nXVIII. \u00a7 20, St. Teresa's words are: Un gran letrado de la orden\ndel glorioso santo Domingo, while Don Vicente retains the old\nreading De la orden del glorioso patriarca santo Domingo.\nMr. Lewis possessed a copy of this photographic reproduction, but\nutilised it only in one instance in his second edition. [1]\nThe publication of the autograph has settled a point of some\nimportance.  The Bollandists (n. 1520), discussing the question\nwhether the headings of the chapters (appended to this\nIntroduction) are by St. Teresa or a later addition, come to the\nconclusion (against the authors of the Reforma de los Descal\u00e7os)\nthat they are clearly an interpolation (clarissime patet) on\naccount of the praise of the doctrine contained in these\narguments.  Notwithstanding their high authority the Bollandists\nare in this respect perfectly wrong, the arguments are entirely\nin St. Teresa's own hand and are exclusively her own work.\nThe Book of Foundations and the Way of Perfection contain similar\narguments in the Saint's handwriting.  Nor need any surprise be\nfelt at the alleged praise of her doctrine for by saying: this\nchapter is most noteworthy (Chap. XIV.), or: this is good\ndoctrine (Chap. XXI.), etc., she takes no credit for herself\nbecause she never grows tired of repeating that she only delivers\nthe message she has received from our Lord. [2]  The Bollandists,\nnot having seen the original, may be excused, but P. Bouix (whom\nMr. Lewis follows in this matter) had no right to suppress these\narguments.  It is to be hoped that future editions of the works\nof S. Teresa will not again deprive the reader of this remarkable\nfeature of her writings.  What she herself thought of her books\nis best told by Yepes in a letter to Father Luis de Leon, the\nfirst editor of her works: \"She was pleased when her writings\nwere being praised and her Order and the convents were held in\nesteem.  Speaking one day of the Way of Perfection, she rejoiced\nto hear it praised, and said to me with great content: Some grave\nmen tell me that it is like Holy Scripture.  For being revealed\ndoctrine it seemed to her that praising her book was like\npraising God.\" [3]\nA notable feature in Mr. Lewis's translation is his division of\nthe chapters into short paragraphs.  But it appears that he\nrearranged the division during the process of printing, with the\nresult that a large number of references were wrong.  No labour\nhas been spared in the correction of these, and I trust that the\npresent edition will be the more useful for it.  In quoting the\nWay of Perfection and the Interior Castle (which he calls Inner\nFortress!) Mr. Lewis refers to similar paragraphs which, however,\nare to be found in no English edition.  A new translation of\nthese two works is greatly needed, and, in the case of the Way of\nPerfection, the manuscript of the Escurial should be consulted as\nwell as that of Valladolid.  Where the writings of S. John of the\nCross are quoted by volume and page, the edition referred to is\nthe one of 1864, another of Mr. Lewis's masterpieces.\nThe chapters in Ribera's Life of St. Teresa refer to the edition\nin the Acts of the Saint by the Bollandists.  These and all other\nquotations have been carefully verified, with the exception of\nthose taken from the works on Mystical theology by Antonius a\nSpiritu Sancto and Franciscus a S. Thoma, which I was unable to\nconsult.  I should have wished to replace the quotations from\nantiquated editions of the Letters of our Saint by references to\nthe new French edition by P. Gr\u00e9goire de S. Joseph (Paris,\nPoussielgue, 1900), which may be considered as the\nstandard\u00a0edition.\nIn note 2 to Chap. XI. Mr. Lewis draws attention to a passage in\na sermon by S. Bernard containing an allusion to different ways\nof watering a garden similar to St. Teresa's well-known\ncomparison.  Mr. Lewis's quotation is incorrect, and I am not\ncertain what sermon he may have had in view.  Something to the\npoint may be found in sermon 22 on the Canticle (Migne,\nP. L. Vol. CLXXXIII, p. 879), and in the first sermon on the\nNativity of our Lord (ibid., p. 115), and also in a sermon on the\nCanticle by one of St. Bernard's disciples (Vol. CLXXXIV.,\np. 195).  I am indebted to the Very Rev. Prior Vincent McNabb,\nO.P., for the verification of a quotation from St. Vincent Ferrer\n(Chap. XX. \u00a7 31).\nSince the publication of Mr. Lewis's translation the uncertainty\nabout the date of St. Teresa's profession has been cleared up.\nYepes, the Bollandists, P. Bouix, Don Vicente de la Fuente,\nMr. Lewis, and numerous other writers assume that she entered the\nconvent of the Incarnation [4] on November 2nd, 1533, and made\nher profession on November 3rd, 1534.  The remaining dates of\nevents previous to her conversion are based upon this, as will be\nseen from the chronology printed by Mr. Lewis at the end of his\nPreface and frequently referred to in the footnotes.  It rests,\nhowever, on inadequate evidence, namely on a single passage in\nthe Life [5] where the Saint says that she was not yet twenty\nyears old when she made her first supernatural experience in\nprayer.  She was twenty in March, 1535, and as this event took\nplace after her profession, the latter was supposed by Yepes and\nhis followers to have taken place in the previous November.\nEven if we had no further evidence, the fact that St. Teresa is\nnot always reliable in her calculation should have warned us not\nto rely too much upon a somewhat casual statement.  In the first\nchapter, \u00a7 7, she positively asserts that she was rather less\nthan twelve years old at the death of her mother, whereas we know\nthat she was at least thirteen years and eight months old.  As to\nthe profession we have overwhelming evidence that it took place\non the 3rd of November, 1536, and her entrance in the convent a\nyear and a day earlier.  To begin with, we have the positive\nstatement of her most intimate friends, Julian d'Avila, Father\nRibera, S.J., and Father Jerome Gratian.  Likewise do\u00f1a Maria\nPinel, nun of the Incarnation, says in her deposition: \"She\n(Teresa of Jesus) took the habit on 2 November, 1535.\" [6]\nThis is corroborated by various passages in the Saint's writings.\nThus, in Relation VII., written in 1575, she says, speaking of\nherself: \"This nun took the habit forty years ago.\"  Again in a\npassage of the Life written about the end of 1564 or the\nbeginning of the following year, [7] she mentions that she has\nbeen a nun for over twenty-eight years, which points to her\nprofession in 1536.  But there are two documents which place the\ndate of profession beyond dispute, namely the act of renunciation\nof her right to the paternal inheritance and the deed of dowry\ndrawn up before a public notary.  Both bear the date 31 October,\n1536.  The authors of the Reforma de los Descal\u00e7os thought that\nthey must have been drawn up before St. Teresa took the habit,\nand therefore placed this event in 1536 and the profession in\n1537, but neither of these documents is necessarily connected\nwith the clothing, yet both must have been completed before\nprofession.  The Constitutions of Blessed John Soreth, drawn up\nin 1462, which were observed at the convent of the Incarnation,\ncontain the following rule with regard to the reception and\ntraining of novices: [8] Consulimus quod recipiendus ante\nsusceptionem habitus expediat se de omnibus quae habet in saeculo\nnisi ex causa rationabili per priorem generalem vel provincialem\nfuerit aliter ordinatum.  There was, indeed, good reason in the\ncase of St. Teresa to postpone these legal matters.  Her father\nwas much opposed to her becoming a nun, but considering his piety\nit might have been expected that before the end of the year of\nprobation he would grant his consent (which in the event he did\nthe very day she took the habit), and make arrangements for the\ndowry.  One little detail concerning her haste in entering the\nconvent has been preserved by the Reforma and the\nBollandists, [9] though neither seem to have understood its\nmeaning.  On leaving the convent of the Incarnation for\nSt. Joseph's in 1563, St. Teresa handed the prioress of the\nformer convent a receipt for her bedding, habit and discipline.\nThis almost ludicrous scrupulosity was in conformity with a\ndecision of the general chapter of 1342 which said: Ingrediens\nordinem ad sui ipsius instantiam habeat lectisternia pro se ipso,\nsin autem recipiens solvat lectum illum.  As St. Teresa entered\nthe convent without the knowledge of her father she did not bring\nthis insignificant trousseau with her; accordingly the prioress\nbecame responsible for it and obtained a receipt when St. Teresa\nwent to the new convent.  The dowry granted by Alphonso Sanchez\nde Cepeda to his daughter consisted of twenty-five measures,\npartly wheat, partly barley, or, in lieu thereof, two hundred\nducats per annum.  Few among the numerous nuns of the Incarnation\ncould have brought a better or even an equal dowry.\nThe date of St. Teresa's profession being thus fixed on the 3rd\nof November, 1536, some other dates of the chronology must be\nrevised.  Her visit to Castellanos de la Canada must have taken\nplace in the early part of 1537.  But already before this time\nthe Saint had an experience which should have proved a warning to\nher, and the neglect of which she never ceased to deplore, namely\nthe vision of our Lord; [10] her own words are that this event\ntook place \"at the very beginning of her acquaintance with the\nperson\" who exercised so dangerous an influence upon her.\nMr. Lewis assigns to it the date 1542, which is impossible seeing\nthat instead of twenty-six it was only twenty-two years before\nshe wrote that passage of her life.  Moreover, it would have\nfallen into the midst of her lukewarmness (according to\nMr. Lewis's chronology) instead of the very beginning.  P. Bouix\nrightly assigns it to the year 1537, but as he is two years in\nadvance of our chronology it does not agree with the surrounding\ncircumstances as described by him.  Bearing in mind the hint\nSt. Teresa gives [11] as to her disposition immediately after her\nprofession, we need not be surprised if the first roots of her\nlukewarmness show themselves so soon.\nFrom Castellanos she proceeded to Hortigosa on a visit to her\nuncle.  While there she became acquainted with the book called\nTercer Abecedario.  Don Vicente remarks that the earliest edition\nknown to him was printed in 1537, which tells strongly against\nthe chronology of the Bollandists, P. Bouix, and others.\nAgain, speaking of her cure at Bezadas she gives a valuable hint\nby saying that she remained blind to certain dangers for more\nthan seventeen years until the Jesuit fathers finally undeceived\nher.  As these came to Avila in 1555 the seventeen years lead us\nback to 1538, which precisely coincides with her sojourn at\nBezadas.  She remained there until Pascua florida of the\nfollowing year.  P. Bouix and others understand by this term Palm\nSunday, but Don Vicente shows good reason that Easter Sunday is\nmeant, which in 1539 was April the 6th.  She then returned to\nAvila, more dead than alive, and remained seriously ill for\nnearly three years, until she was cured through the miraculous\nintervention of St. Joseph about the beginning of 1542.\nNow began the period of lukewarmness which was temporally\ninterrupted by the illness and death of her father, in 1544 or\n1545, and came to an end about 1555.  Don Vicente, followed by\nMr. Lewis, draws attention to what he believes to be a \"proof of\ngreat laxity of the convent,\" that St. Teresa should have been\nurged by one of her confessors to communicate as often as once a\nfortnight.  It should be understood that frequent communion such\nas we now see it practised was wholly unknown in her time.\nThe Constitutions of the Order specified twelve days on which all\nthose that were not priests should communicate, adding:\nVerumtamen fratres professi prout Deus eis devotionem contulerit\ndiebus dominicis et festis duplicibus (i.e., on feasts of our\nLady, the Apostles, etc.), communicare poterunt si qui velint.\nThus, communicating about once a month St. Teresa acted as\nordinary good Religious were wont to do, and by approaching the\nsacrament more frequently she placed herself among the more\nfervent nuns. [12]\nSt. Teresa wrote quite a number of different accounts of her\nlife.  The first, addressed to Father Juan de Padranos, S.J. [13]\nand dated 1557, is now lost.  The second, written for St. Peter\nof Alcantara, is Relation I. at the end of this volume; a copy of\nit, together with a continuation (Relation II.) was sent to\nFather Pedro Iba\u00f1ez in 1562.  It is somewhat difficult to admit\nthat in the very same year she wrote another, more extensive,\naccount to the same priest, which is generally called the \"first\"\nLife.  At the end of the Life such as we have it now, St. Teresa\nwrote: \"This book was finished in June, 1562,\" and Father Ba\u00f1ez\nwrote underneath: \"This date refers to the first account which\nthe Holy Mother Teresa of Jesus wrote of her life; it was not\nthen divided into chapters.  Afterwards she made this copy and\ninserted in it many things which had taken place subsequent to\nthis date, such as the foundation of the monastery of St. Joseph\nof Avila.\"  Elsewhere Father Ba\u00f1ez says: [14] \"Of one of her\nbooks, namely, the one in which she recorded her life and the\nmanner of prayer whereby God had led her, I can say that she\ncomposed it to the end that her confessors might know her the\nbetter and instruct her, and also that it might encourage and\nanimate those who learn from it the great mercy God had shown\nher, a great sinner as she humbly acknowledged herself to be.\nThis book was already written when I made her acquaintance, her\nprevious confessors having given her permission to that effect.\nAmong these was a licentiate of the Dominican Order, the Reverend\nFather Pedro Iba\u00f1ez, reader of Divinity at Avila.  She afterwards\ncompleted and recast this book.\"  These two passages of Ba\u00f1ez\nhave led the biographers of the Saint to think that she wrote her\nLife twice, first in 1561 and the following year, completing it\nin the house of Do\u00f1a Luisa de la Cerda at Toledo, in the month of\nJune; and secondly between 1563 and 1565 at St. Joseph's Convent\nof Avila.  They have been at pains to point out a number of\nplaces which could not have been in the \"first\" Life, but must\nhave been added in the second; [15] and they took it for granted\nthat the letter with which the book as we now have it concludes,\nwas addressed to Father Iba\u00f1ez in 1562, when the Saint sent him\nthe \"first\" Life.  It bears neither address nor date, but from\nits contents I am bound to conclude that it was written in 1565,\nthat it refers to the \"second\" Life, and that whomsoever it was\naddressed to, it cannot have been to Father Iba\u00f1ez, who was\nalready dead at the time. [16]  Saint Teresa asks the writer to\nsend a copy of the book to Father Juan de Avila.  Now we know\nfrom her letters that as late as 1568 this request had not been\ncomplied with, and that St. Teresa had to write twice to Do\u00f1a\nLuisa for this purpose; [17] but if she had already given these\ninstructions in 1562, it is altogether incomprehensible that she\ndid not see to it earlier, especially when the \"first\" Life was\nreturned to her for the purpose of copying and completing it.\nThe second reason which prevents me from considering this letter\nas connected with the \"first\" Life will be examined when I come\nto speak of the different ends the Saint had in view when writing\nher Life.  It is more difficult to say to whom the letter was\nreally addressed.  The Reforma suggests Father Garcia de Toledo,\nDominican, who bade the Saint write the history of the foundation\nof St. Joseph's at Avila [18] and who was her confessor at that\nconvent.  It moreover believes that he it is to whom Chapter\nXXXIV. \u00a7\u00a7 8-20 refers, and this opinion appears to me plausible.\nAs to the latter point, Yepes thinks the Dominican at Toledo was\nFather Vicente Barron, the Bollandists offer no opinion, and\nMr. Lewis, in his first edition gives first the one and then the\nother.  If, as I think, Father Garcia was meant, the passage in\nChapter XVI. \u00a7 10, beginning \"O, my son,\" would concern him also,\nas well as several passages where Vuestra Merced--you, my\nFather--is addressed.  For although the book came finally into\nthe hands of Father Ba\u00f1ez, it was first delivered into those of\nthe addressee of the letter.\nWhether the previous paper was a mere \"Relation,\" or really a\nfirst attempt at a \"Life,\" [19] there can be no dispute about its\npurpose: St. Teresa speaks of it in the following terms: \"I had\nrecourse to my Dominican father (Iba\u00f1ez); I told him all about my\nvisions, my way of prayer, the great graces our Lord had given\nme, as clearly as I could, and begged him to consider the matter\nwell, and tell me if there was anything therein at variance with\nthe Holy Writings, and give me his opinion on the whole\nmatter.\" [20]  The account thus rendered had the object of\nenabling Father Iba\u00f1ez to give her light upon the state of her\nsoul.  But while she was drawing it up, a great change came over\nher.  During St. Teresa's sojourn at Toledo she became from a\npupil an experienced master in Mystical knowledge.  \"When I was\nthere a religious\" (probably Father Garcia de Toledo) \"with whom\nI had conversed occasionally some years ago, happened to arrive.\nWhen I was at Mass in a monastery of his Order, I felt a longing\nto know the state of his soul.\" [21]  Three times the Saint rose\nfrom her seat, three times she sat down again, but at last she\nwent to see him in a confessional, not to ask for any light for\nherself, but to give him what light she could, for she wished to\ninduce him to surrender himself more perfectly to God, and this\nshe accomplished by telling him how she had fared since their\nlast meeting.  No one who reads this remarkable chapter can help\nbeing struck by the change that has come over Teresa: the period\nof her schooling is at an end, and she is now the great teacher\nof Mystical theology.  Her humility does not allow her to speak\nwith the same degree of openness upon her achievements as she did\nwhen making known her failings, yet she cannot conceal the Gift\nof Wisdom she had received and the use she made of it.\nSt. Teresa's development, if extraordinary considering the degree\nof spirituality she reached, was nevertheless gradual and\nregular.  With her wonderful power of analysis, she has given us\nnot only a clear insight into her interior progress, but also a\nsketch of the development of her understanding of supernatural\nthings.  \"It is now (i.e., about the end of 1563) some five or\nsix years, I believe, since our Lord raised me to this state of\nprayer, in its fulness, and that more than once,--and I never\nunderstood it, and never could explain it; and so I was resolved,\nwhen I should come thus far in my story, to say very little or\nnothing at all.\" [22]  In the following chapter she adds: \"You,\nmy father, will be delighted greatly to find an account of the\nmatter in writing, and to understand it; for it is one grace that\nour Lord gives grace; and it is another grace to understand what\ngrace and what gift it is; and it is another and further grace to\nhave the power to describe and explain it to others.  Though it\ndoes not seem that more than the first of these--the giving of\ngrace--is necessary, it is a great advantage and a great grace to\nunderstand it.\" [23]  These words contain the clue to much that\notherwise would be obscure in the life of our Saint: great graces\nwere bestowed upon her, but at first she neither understood them\nherself nor was she able to describe them.  Hence the inability\nof her confessors and spiritual advisers to guide her.\nHer natural gifts, great though they were, did not help her much.\n\"Though you, my father, may think that I have a quick\nunderstanding, it is not so; for I have found out in many ways\nthat my understanding can take in only, as they say, what is\ngiven it to eat.  Sometimes my confessor used to be amazed at my\nignorance: and he never explained to me--nor, indeed, did I\ndesire to understand--how God did this, nor how it could be.\nNor did I ever ask.\" [24]  At first she was simply bewildered by\nthe favours shown her, afterwards she could not help knowing,\ndespite the fears of over anxious friends, that they did come\nfrom God, and that so far from imperilling her soul made a\ndifferent woman of her, but even then she was not able to explain\nto others what she experienced in herself.  But shortly before\nthe foundation of St. Joseph's convent she received the last of\nthe three graces mentioned above, the Gift of Wisdom, and the\nscene at Toledo is the first manifestation of it.\nThis explains the difference of the \"Life\" such as we know it\nfrom the first version or the \"Relations\" preceding it.\nWhatever this writing was, it still belonged to the period of her\nspiritual education, whereas the volume before us is the\nfirst-fruit of her spiritual Mastership.  The new light that had\ncome to her induced her confessors [25] to demand a detailed work\nembodying everything she had learned from her heavenly\nTeacher. [26]  The treatise on Mystical theology contained in\nChapters X. to XXI., the investigation of Divine locutions,\nVisions and Revelations in the concluding portion of the work\ncould have had no place in any previous writing.  While her\nexperiences before she obtained the Gift of Wisdom influenced but\nthree persons (one of them being her father), a great many\nprofited by her increased knowledge. [27]  The earlier writings\nwere but confidential communications to her confessors, and if\nthey became known to larger circles this was due to indiscretion.\nBut her \"Life\" was written from the beginning with a view to\npublication.  Allusions to this object may be found in various\nplaces [28] as well as in the letter appended to the book, [29]\nbut the decisive utterances must be sought for elsewhere, namely\nin the \"Way of Perfection.\" This work was written immediately\nafter the \"Life,\" while the Saint was as yet at the convent of\nSt. Joseph's.  It was re-written later on and is now only known\nin its final shape, but the first version, the original of which\nis preserved at the Escurial and has been reproduced\nphotographically, leaves no doubt as to the intentions of\nSt. Teresa in writing her \"Life.\"  \"I have written a few days ago\na certain Relation of my Life.  But since it might happen that my\nconfessor may not permit you (the Sisters of St. Joseph's) to\nread it, I will put here some things concerning prayer which are\nconformable to what I have said there, as well as some other\nthings which appear to me to be necessary.\" [30]  Again: \"As all\nthis is better explained in the book which I say I have written,\nthere is no need for me to speak of it with so much detail.\nI have said there all I know. Those of you who have been led by\nGod to this degree of contemplation (and I say that some have\nbeen led so far), should procure the book because it is important\nfor you, after I am dead.\" [31]  At the end she writes: \"Since\nthe Lord has taught you the way and has inspired me as to what I\nshould put in the book which I say has been written, how they\nshould behave who have arrived at this fountain of living water\nand what the soul feels there, and how God satiates her and makes\nher lose the thirst for things of this world and causes her to\ngrow in things pertaining to the service of God; that book,\ntherefore, will be of great help for those who have arrived at\nthis state, and will give them much light.  Procure it.\nFor Father Domingo Ba\u00f1ez, presentado of the Order of St. Dominic\nwho, as I say, is my confessor, and to whom I shall give this,\nhas it: if he judges that you should see this, and gives it to\nyou, he will also give you the other.\" [32]  While the first and\nsecond of these quotations may be found, somewhat weakened, in\nthe final version of the \"Way of Perfection,\" the last one is\nentirely omitted.  Nor need this surprise us, for Father Ba\u00f1ez\nhad his own ideas about the advisability of the publication of\nthe \"Life.\" In his deposition, already referred to, he says: \"It\nwas not convenient that this book should become public during her\nlifetime, but rather that it should be kept at the Holy Office\n(the Inquisition) until we knew the end of this person; it was\ntherefore quite against my will that some copies were taken while\nit was in the hands of the bishop Don Alvaro Mendoza, who, being\na powerful prelate and having received it from the said Teresa of\nJesus, allowed it to be copied and showed it to his sister, do\u00f1a\nMaria de Mendoza; thus certain persons taking an interest in\nspiritual matters and knowing already some portions of this\ntreatise (evidently the contents of the divulged Relations) made\nfurther copies, one of which became the property of the Duchess\nof Alba, do\u00f1a Maria Enriquez, and is now, I think, in the hands\nof her daughter-in-law, do\u00f1a Maria de Toledo.  All this was\nagainst my wish, and I was much annoyed with the said Teresa of\nJesus, though I knew well it was not her fault but the fault of\nthose to whom she had confided the book, and I told her she ought\nto burn the original because it would never do that the writings\nof women should become public property; to which she answered she\nwas quite aware of it and would certainly burn it if I told her\nto do so; but knowing her great humility and obedience I did not\ndare to have it destroyed but handed it to the Holy Office for\nsafe-keeping, whence it has been withdrawn since her death and\npublished in print.\" [33]  From this it will be seen that Ba\u00f1ez,\nwho had given a most favourable opinion when the \"Life\" was\ndenounced to the Inquisition (1574), resulting in the approbation\nby Cardinal de Quiroga to the great joy of St. Teresa, [34]\nreturned it to the Holy Office for safety's sake. It was\nwithdrawn by the Ven. Mother Anne of Jesus when the Order had\ndecided upon the publication of the works of the Saint, but too\nlate to be utilised then.  Father Luis de Leon, the editor, had\nto content himself with the copy already alluded to.\nSt. Teresa wrote her \"Life\" slowly.  It was begun in spring,\n1563, [35] and completed in May or June, 1565.  She complains\nthat she can only work at it by stealth on account of her duties\nat the distaff; [36] but the book is written with so much order\nand method, the manuscript is so free from mistakes, corrections\nand erasures, that we may conclude that while spinning she worked\nit out in her mind, so that the apparent delay proved most\nadvantageous.  In this respect the \"Life\" is superior to the\nfirst version of the \"Way of Perfection.\"  This latter work was\nprinted during her lifetime, though it appeared only after her\ndeath.  In 1586 the Definitory of the province of Discalced\nCarmelites decided upon the publication of the complete works of\nthe Saint, but for obvious reasons deemed not only the members of\nher own Order but also Dominicans and Jesuits ineligible for the\npost of editor.  Such of the manuscripts as could be found were\ntherefore confided to the Augustinian Father, Luis de Leon,\nprofessor at Salamanca, who prepared the edition but did not live\nto carry it through the press.  The fact that he did not know the\nautograph of the \"Life\" accounts for the numerous inaccuracies to\nbe found in nearly all editions, but the publication of the\noriginal should ensure a great improvement for the future.\nSt. Teresa's canonisation took place before the stringent laws of\nUrban VIII. came into force.  Consequently, the writings of the\nSaint were not then enquired into, the Holy See contenting itself\nwith the approbations granted by the Spanish Inquisition, and by\nthe congregation of the Rota in Rome.  A certain number of\npassages selected from various works having been denounced by\nsome Roman theologians as being contrary to the teaching of\nSt. Thomas Aquinas and other authorities, Diego Alvarez, a\nDominican, and John Rada, a Franciscan, were commissioned to\nexamine the matter and report on it.  The twelve censures with\nthe answers of the two theologians and the final judgment of the\nRota seem to have remained unknown to the Bollandists. [37]\nThe \"heavenly doctrine\" of St. Teresa is alluded to not only in\nthe Bull of canonisation but even in the Collect of the Mass of\nthe Saint.\nConcerning the English translations of the \"Life\" noticed by\nMr. Lewis it should be mentioned that the one ascribed to Abraham\nWoodhead is only partly his work.  Father Bede of St. Simon Stock\n(Walter Joseph Travers), a Discalced Carmelite, labouring on the\nEnglish Mission from 1660 till 1692, was anxious to complete the\ntranslation of St. Teresa's works into English.  He had not\nproceeded very far when he learnt that \"others were engaged in\nthe same task.  On enquiry he found that a new translation was\ncontemplated by two graduates of the University of Cambridge,\nconverts to the Faith, most learned and pious men, who were\nleading a solitary life, spending their time and talents in the\ncomposition of controversial and devotional works for the good of\ntheir neighbour and the glory of God.\"  One of these two men was\nWoodhead, who, however, was an Oxford man, but the name of the\nother, who must have been a Cambridge man, is not known.\nThey undertook the translation while Father Bede provided the\nfunds and bore the risks of what was then a dangerous work.\nAs there existed already two English translations of the \"Life,\"\nthe first volume to appear (1669) contained the Book of\nFoundations, to which was prefixed the history of the foundation\nof St. Joseph's from the \"Life.\"  When, therefore, the new\ntranslation of the latter appeared, in 1671, this portion of the\nbook was omitted. [38]  The translation was made direct from the\nSpanish but \"uniformly with the Italian edition.\"\nMr. Lewis, whose translation is the fifth, was born on the 12th\nof November, 1814, and died on January the 23rd, 1895.  The first\nedition was printed in 1870, the second in 1888.  It is\nregrettable that the latter edition, of which the present is a\nreprint, omitted the marginal notes which would have been so\nhelpful to the reader.\nSt. Teresa's life and character having always been a favourite\nstudy of men and women of various schools of thought, it may be\nuseful to notice here a few recent English and foreign works on\nthe subject:--\nThe Life of Saint Teresa, by the author of \"Devotions before and\nafter Holy Communion\" (i.e., Miss Maria Trench), London, 1875.\nThe Life of Saint Teresa of the Order of Our Lady of Mount\nCarmel.

In Spanish and Italian it should be written without\nan h as these languages do not admit the use of Th; in English,\nlikewise, where this combination of letters represents a special\nsound, the name should be spelt with T only.  But the present\nfashion of thus writing it in Latin, German, French, and other\nlanguages, which generally maintain the etymological spelling, is\nintolerable: The name is Greek, and was placed on the calendar in\nhonour of a noble Spanish lady, St. Therasia, who became the wife\nof a Saint, Paulinus of Nola, and a Saint herself.

The date of this part of the Life can be\neasily ascertained from the two following chapters.  In xxxvii. \u00a7\n18, St. Teresa says that she is not yet fifty years old,\nconsequently the chapter must have been written before the end of\nMarch, 1565; and in the next chapter, xxxviii. \u00a7 15, she speaks\nof the death of Father Pedro Iba\u00f1ez, which appears to have taken\nplace on 2nd February.  This, at least, is the date under which\nhis name appears in the Ann\u00e9e Dominicaine, and the Very\nRev. Prior Vincent McNabb tells me that there is every reason to\nthink that it is the date of his death.\n8. When about A.D. 1452 certain communities of Beguines demanded\naffiliation to the Carmelite Order, they were given the\nConstitutions of the friars without any alterations.\nThese Constitutions were revised in 1462, but neither there nor\nin the Acts of the General Chapters, so far as these are\npreserved, is there the slightest reference to convents of nuns.\nThe colophon of the printed edition (Venice, 1499) shows that\nthey held good for friars and nuns: Expliciunt sacrae\nconstitutiones novae fratrum et sororum beatae Mariae de Monte\nCarmelo.  They contain the customary laws forbidding the friars\nunder pain of excommunication, to leave the precincts of their\nconvents without due licence, but do not enjoin strict enclosure,\nwhich would have been incompatible with their manner of life and\ntheir various duties.  St. Teresa nowhere insinuates that the\nConstitutions, such as they were, were not kept at the\nIncarnation; her remarks in chap. vii. are aimed at the\nConstitutions themselves, which were never made for nuns, and\ntherefore did not provide for the needs of their convents.\n9.

In the Prologue to the Book of Foundations, Father Garcia de\nToledo, her confessor at St. Joseph's Convent, is said to be\nresponsible for the order to rewrite the \"Life\"; but in the\nPreface to the \"Life\" St. Teresa speaks of her \"confessors\" in\nthe plural.  Fathers Iba\u00f1ez and Ba\u00f1ez may be included in the\nnumber. See also ch. xxx. \u00a7 27.\n26. Chap. xviii. \u00a7 11.\n27. Chap. xiii. \u00a7 22.  In chap. xvi. \u00a7 12, the Saint says: \"I\nwish we five who now love one another in our Lord, had made some\nsuch arrangement, etc.\"  Fuente is of opinion that these five\nwere, besides the Saint, Father Julian de Avila, Don Francisco de\nSalcedo, St. John of the Cross, and Don Lorenzo de Cepeda,\nSt. Teresa's brother: but this is impossible at the date of this\npart of the \"Life.\"  It is more probable that she meant Francisco\nde Salcedo, Gaspar Daza, Julian de Avila, and Father Iba\u00f1ez, the\nlatter being still alive in the beginning of 1564, when this\nchapter was written.  It is more difficult to say who the three\nconfessors were whom St. Teresa desired to see the \"Life\"\n(ch. xl. \u00a7 32).  If, as I think, the book was first handed to\nFather Garcia de Toledo, the others may have been Francisco de\nSalcedo, Baltasar Alvarez, and Gaspar de Salazar.\n28.

In the Prologue to the Book of Foundations, St. Teresa says\nthat Father Garcia de Toledo ordered her to rewrite the book the\nsame year in which St. Joseph's Convent was founded, i.e. 1562,\nbut seeing that she only spent a few hours there and that the\nprincipal difficulties only arose after her return to the\nIncarnation, it appears more probable that Father Garcia's\ncommand was not made until the spring of the following year, when\nshe went to live at St. Joseph's.\n36.

See Carmel in England, by Rev. Father B. Zimmerman,\np. 240 sqq.\nSt. Teresa's Arguments of the Chapters.\nJ.H.S.\nJ.H.S. Chapter I. [1]--In which she tells how God [2] began to\ndispose this soul from childhood for virtue, and how she was\nhelped by having virtuous parents.\nChapter II.--How she lost these virtues and how important it is\nto deal from childhood with virtuous persons.\nChapter III.--In which she sets forth how good company was the\nmeans of her resuming good intentions, and in what manner God\nbegan to give her some light on the deception to which she\nwas subjected.\nChapter IV.--She explains how, with the assistance of God, she\ncompelled herself to take the (Religious) habit, and how His\nMajesty began to send her many infirmities.\nChapter V.--She continues to speak of the great infirmities she\nsuffered and the patience God gave her to bear them, and how He\nturned evil into good, as is seen from something that happened\nat the place where she went for a cure.\nChapter VI.--Of the great debt she owes God for giving her\nconformity of her will (with His) in her trials, and how she\nturned towards the glorious St. Joseph as her helper and\nadvocate, and how much she profited thereby.\nChapter VII.--Of the way whereby she lost the graces God had\ngranted her, and the wretched life she began to lead; she also\nspeaks of the danger arising from the want of a strict enclosure\nin convents of nuns.\nChapter VIII.--Of the great advantage she derived from not\nentirely abandoning prayer so as not to lose her soul; and what\nan excellent remedy this is in order to win back what one has\nlost.  She exhorts everybody to practise prayer, and shows what a\ngain it is, even if one should have given it up for a time, to\nmake use of so great a good.\nChapter IX.--By what means God began to rouse her soul and give\nlight in the midst of darkness, and to strengthen her virtues so\nthat she should not offend Him.\nChapter X.--She begins to explain the graces God gave her in\nprayer, and how much we can do for ourselves, and of the\nimportance of understanding God's mercies towards us.\nShe requests those to whom this is to be sent to keep the\nremainder (of this book) secret, since they have commanded her to\ngo into so many details about the graces God has shown her.\nChapter XI.--In which she sets forth how it is that we do not\nlove God perfectly in a short time.  She begins to expound by\nmeans of a comparison four degrees of prayer, of the first of\nwhich she treats here; this is most profitable for beginners and\nfor those who find no taste in prayer.\nChapter XII.--Continuation of the first state.  She declares how\nfar, with the grace of God, we can proceed by ourselves, and\nspeaks of the danger of seeking supernatural and extraordinary\nexperiences before God lifts up the soul.\nChapter XIII.--She continues to treat of the first degree, and\ngives advice with respect to certain temptations sometimes sent\nby Satan.  This is most profitable.\nChapter XIV.--She begins to explain the second degree of prayer\nin which God already gives the soul special consolations, which\nshe shows here to be supernatural.  This is most noteworthy.\nChapter XV.--Continuing the same subject, she gives certain\nadvice how one should behave in the prayer of quiet.  She shows\nthat many souls advance so far, but that few go beyond.\nThe matters treated of in this chapter are very necessary\nand profitable.\nChapter XVI.--On the third degree of prayer; she declares things\nof an elevated nature; what the soul that has come so far can do,\nand the effect of such great graces of God.  This is calculated\nto greatly animate the spirit to the praise of God, and contains\nadvice for those who have reached this point.\nChapter XVII.--Continues to declare matters concerning the third\ndegree of prayer and completes the explanation of its effects.\nShe also treats of the impediment caused by the imagination and\nthe memory.\nChapter XVIII.--She treats of the fourth degree of prayer, and\nbegins to explain [3] in what high dignity God holds a soul that\nhas attained this state; this should animate those who are given\nto prayer, to make an effort to reach so high a state since it\ncan be obtained in this world, though not by merit but only\nthrough the goodness of God. [4]\nChapter XIX.--She continues the same subject, and begins to\nexplain the effects on the soul of this degree of prayer.\nShe earnestly exhorts not to turn back nor to give up prayer even\nif, after having received this favour, one should fall.\nShe shows the damage that would result (from the neglect of this\nadvice). This is most noteworthy and consoling for the weak and\nfor sinners.\nChapter XX.--She speaks of the difference between Union and\nTrance, and explains what a Trance is; she also says something\nabout the good a soul derives from being, through God's goodness,\nled so far.  She speaks of the effects of Union. [5]\nChapter XXI.--She continues and concludes this last degree of\nprayer, and says what a soul having reached it feels when obliged\nto turn back and live in the world, and speaks of the light God\ngives concerning the deceits (of the world).  This is\ngood doctrine.\nChapter XXII.--In which she shows that the safest way for\ncontemplatives is not to lift up the spirit to high things but to\nwait for God to lift it up.  How the Sacred Humanity of Christ is\nthe medium for the most exalted contemplation.  She mentions an\nerror under which she laboured for some time.  This chapter is\nmost profitable.\nChapter XXIII.--She returns to the history of her life, how she\nbegan to practise greater perfection.  This is profitable for\nthose who have to direct souls practising prayer that they may\nknow how to deal with beginners, and she speaks of the profit she\nderived from such knowledge.\nChapter XXIV.--She continues the same subject and tells how her\nsoul improved since she began to practise obedience, and how\nlittle she was able to resist God's graces, and how His Majesty\ncontinued to give them more and more abundantly.\nChapter XXV.--Of the manner in which Locutions of God are\nperceived by the soul without being actually heard; and of some\ndeceits that might take place in this matter, and how one is to\nknow which is which.  This is most profitable for those who are\nin this degree of prayer, because it is very well explained, and\ncontains excellent doctrine.\nChapter XXVI.--She continues the same subject; explains and tells\nthings that have happened to her which caused her to lose fear\nand convinced her that the spirit which spoke to her was a\ngood one.\nChapter XXVII.--Of another way in which God teaches a soul, and,\nwithout speaking, makes His Will known in an admirable manner.\nShe goes on to explain a vision, though not an imaginary one, and\na great grace with which God favoured her.  This chapter\nis noteworthy.\nChapter XXVIII.--She treats of the great favours God showed her,\nand how He appeared to her for the first time; she explains what\nan imaginary vision is, and speaks of the powerful effects it\nleaves and the signs whether it is from God.  This chapter is\nmost profitable and noteworthy.\nChapter XXIX.--She continues and tells of some great mercies God\nshowed her, and what His Majesty said to her in order to assure\nher (of the truth of these visions), and taught her how to\nanswer contradictors.\nChapter XXX.--She continues the history of her life, and how God\nsent her a remedy for all her anxieties by calling the holy Friar\nFray Pedro de Alcantara of the Order of the glorious St. Francis\nto the place where she lived.  She mentions some great\ntemptations and interior trials through which she sometimes had\nto pass.\nChapter XXXI.--She speaks of some exterior temptations and\napparitions of Satan, and how he ill-treated her.  She mentions,\nmoreover, some very good things by way of advice to persons who\nare walking on the way of perfection.\nChapter XXXII.--She narrates how it pleased God to put her in\nspirit in that place of Hell she had deserved by her sins.\nShe tells a little [6] of what she saw there compared with what\nthere was besides.  She begins to speak of the manner and way\nof founding the convent of St. Joseph where she now lives.\nChapter XXXIII.--She continues the subject of the foundation of\nthe glorious St. Joseph.  How she was commanded to have nothing\n(further) to do with it, how she abandoned it, also the troubles\nit brought her and how God consoled her in all this.\nChapter XXXIV.--She shows how at that time it happened that she\nabsented herself from this place and how her Superior commanded\nher to go away at the request of a very noble lady who was in\ngreat affliction.  She begins to tell what happened to her there,\nand the great grace God bestowed upon her in determining through\nher instrumentality a person of distinction to serve Him truly;\nand how that person found favour and help in her (Teresa).\nThis is noteworthy.\nChapter XXXV.--Continuation of the foundation of this house of\nour glorious Father St. Joseph; in what manner our Lord ordained\nthat holy poverty should be observed there; the reason why she\nleft the lady with whom she had been staying, and some other\nthings that happened.\nChapter XXXVI.--She continues the same subject, and shows how the\nfoundation of this convent of the glorious St. Joseph was finally\naccomplished, and the great contradictions and persecutions she\nhad to endure after the Religious had taken the habit, and the\ngreat trials and temptations through which she passed, and how\nGod led her forth victorious to His own glory and praise.\nChapter XXXVII.--Of the effects which remained when God granted\nher some favour; together with other very good doctrine.\nShe shows how one ought to strive after and prize every increase\nin heavenly glory, and that for no trouble whatever one should\nneglect a good that is to be perpetual.\nChapter XXXVIII.--She treats of some great mercies God showed\nher, even making known to her heavenly secrets by means of\nvisions and revelations His Majesty vouchsafed to grant her; she\nspeaks of the effects they caused and the great improvement\nresulting in her soul.\nChapter XXXIX.--She continues the same subject, mentioning great\ngraces granted her by God; how He promised to hear her requests\non behalf of persons for whom she should pray.  Some remarkable\ninstances in which His Majesty thus favoured her.\nChapter XL.--Continuation of the same subject of great mercies\nGod has shown her.  From some of these very good doctrine may be\ngathered, and this, as she declares, was, besides compliance with\nobedience, her principal motive (in writing this book), namely to\nenumerate such of these mercies as would be instructive to souls.\nThis chapter brings the history of her Life, written by herself,\nto an end.  May it be for the glory of God.  Amen.\n1. St. Teresa wrote no title, either of the whole book or of the\nPreface, but only the monogram J.H.S., which is repeated at the\nbeginning of the first chapter and at the end of the last,\nprevious to the letter with which the volume concludes.\n2. \"El Se\u00f1or\" is everywhere translated by \"God\" in distinction to\n\"Nuestro Se\u00f1or,\" \"Our Lord.\"\n3. \"In an excellent manner,\" scored through by the Saint herself.\n4. \"To be read with great care, as it is explained in a most\ndelicate way, and contains many noteworthy points,\" also scored\nthrough by St. Teresa herself.\n5. \"This is most admirable,\" scored through by the Saint.\n6. \"Una cifra,\" a mere nothing.\nPreface by David Lewis.\nSt. Teresa was born in Avila on Wednesday, March 28, 1515.\nHer father was Don Alfonso Sanchez de Cepeda, and her mother Do\u00f1a\nBeatriz Davila y Ahumada.  The name she received in her baptism\nwas common to both families, for her great-grandmother on the\nfather's side was Teresa Sanchez, and her grandmother on her\nmother's side was Teresa de las Cuevas.  While she remained in\nthe world, and even after she had become a nun in the monastery\nof the Incarnation, which was under the mitigated rule, she was\nknown as Do\u00f1a Teresa Sanchez Cepeda Davila y Ahumada; for in\nthose days children took the name either of the father or of the\nmother, as it pleased them.  The two families were noble, but\nthat of Ahumada was no longer in possession of its former wealth\nand power. [1]  Do\u00f1a Beatriz was the second wife of Don Alfonso,\nand was related in the fourth degree to the first wife, as\nappears from the dispensation granted to make the marriage valid\non the 16th of October, 1509.  Of this marriage Teresa was the\nthird child.\nDo\u00f1a Beatriz died young, and the eldest daughter, Maria de\nCepeda, took charge of her younger sisters--they were two--and\nwas as a second mother to them till her marriage, which took\nplace in 1531, when the Saint was in her sixteenth year.  But as\nshe was too young to be left in charge of her father's house, and\nas her education was not finished, she was sent to the\nAugustinian monastery, the nuns of which received young girls,\nand brought them up in the fear of God. [2]  The Saint's own\naccount is that she was too giddy and careless to be trusted at\nhome, and that it was necessary to put her under the care of\nthose who would watch over her and correct her ways.\nShe remained a year and a half with the Augustinian nuns, and all\nthe while God was calling her to Himself.  She was not willing to\nlisten to His voice; she would ask the nuns to pray for her that\nshe might have light to see her way; \"but for all this,\" she\nwrites, \"I wished not to be a nun.\" [3]  By degrees her will\nyielded, and she had some inclination to become a religious at\nthe end of the eighteen months of her stay, but that was all.\nShe became ill; her father removed her, and the struggle within\nherself continued,--on the one hand, the voice of God calling\nher; on the other, herself labouring to escape from her vocation.\nAt last, after a struggle which lasted three months, she made up\nher mind, and against her inclination, to give up the world.\nShe asked her father's leave, and was refused.  She besieged him\nthrough her friends, but to no purpose.  \"The utmost I could get\nfrom him,\" she says, \"was that I might do as I pleased after his\ndeath.\" [4]  How long this contest with her father lasted is not\nknown, but it is probable that it lasted many months, for the\nSaint was always most careful of the feelings of others, and\nwould certainly have endured much rather than displease a father\nwhom she loved so much, and who also loved her more than his\nother children. [5]\nBut she had to forsake her father, and so she left her father's\nhouse by stealth, taking with her one of her brothers, whom she\nhad persuaded to give himself to God in religion.  The brother\nand sister set out early in the morning, the former for the\nmonastery of the Dominicans, and the latter for the Carmelite\nmonastery of the Incarnation, in Avila.  The nuns received her\ninto the house, but sent word to her father of his child's\nescape.  Don Alfonso, however, yielded at once, and consented to\nthe sacrifice which he was compelled to make.\nIn the monastery of the Incarnation the Saint was led on, without\nher own knowledge, to states of prayer so high, that she became\nalarmed about herself.  In the purity and simplicity of her soul,\nshe feared that the supernatural visitations of God might after\nall be nothing else but delusions of Satan. [6]  She was so\nhumble, that she could not believe graces so great could be given\nto a sinner like herself.  The first person she consulted in her\ntrouble seems to have been a layman, related to her family, Don\nFrancisco de Salcedo.  He was a married man, given to prayer, and\na diligent frequenter of the theological lectures in the\nmonastery of the Dominicans.  Through him she obtained the help\nof a holy priest, Gaspar Daza, to whom she made known the state\nof her soul.  The priest, hindered by his other labours, declined\nto be her director, and the Saint admits that she could have made\nno progress under his guidance. [7]  She now placed herself in\nthe hands of Don Francis, who encouraged her in every way, and,\nfor the purpose of helping her onwards in the way of perfection,\ntold her of the difficulties he himself had met with, and how by\nthe grace of God he had overcome them.\nBut when the Saint told him of the great graces which God\nbestowed upon her, Don Francis became alarmed; he could not\nreconcile them with the life the Saint was living, according to\nher own account. He never thought of doubting the Saint's\naccount, and did not suspect her of exaggerating her\nimperfections in the depths of her humility: \"he thought the evil\nspirit might have something to do\" with her, [8] and advised her\nto consider carefully her way of prayer.\nDon Francis now applied again to Gaspar Daza, and the two friends\nconsulted together; but, after much prayer on their part and on\nthat of the Saint, they came to the conclusion that she \"was\ndeluded by an evil spirit,\" and recommended her to have recourse\nto the fathers of the Society of Jesus, lately settled in Avila.\nThe Saint, now in great fear, but still hoping and trusting that\nGod would not suffer her to be deceived, made preparations for a\ngeneral confession; and committed to writing the whole story of\nher life, and made known the state of her soul to F.  Juan de\nPadranos, one of the fathers of the Society.  F. Juan understood\nit all, and comforted her by telling her that her way of prayer\nwas sound and the work of God.  Under his direction she made\ngreat progress, and for the further satisfaction of her\nconfessor, and of Don Francis, who seems to have still retained\nsome of his doubts, she told everything to St. Francis de Borja,\nwho on one point changed the method of direction observed by\nF. Juan.  That father recommended her to resist the supernatural\nvisitations of the spirit as much as she could, but she was not\nable, and the resistance pained her; [9] St. Francis told her she\nhad done enough, and that it was not right to prolong\nthat resistance. [10]\nThe account of her life which she wrote before she applied to the\nJesuits for direction has not been preserved; but it is possible\nthat it was made more for her own security than for the purpose\nof being shown to her confessor.\nThe next account is Relation I., made for St. Peter of Alcantara,\nand was probably seen by many; for that Saint had to defend her,\nand maintain that the state of her soul was the work of God,\nagainst those who thought that she was deluded by Satan.  Her own\nconfessor was occasionally alarmed, and had to consult others,\nand thus, by degrees, her state became known to many; and there\nwere some who, were so persuaded of her delusions, that they\nwished her to be exorcised as one possessed of an evil\nspirit, [11] and at a later time her friends were afraid that she\nmight be denounced to the Inquisitors. [12]\nDuring the troubles that arose when it became known that the\nSaint was about to found the monastery of St. Joseph, and therein\nestablish the original rule of her Order in its primitive\nsimplicity and austerity, she went for counsel to the Father Fra\nPedro Iba\u00f1ez, [13] the Dominican, a most holy and learned priest.\nThat father not only encouraged her, and commended her work, but\nalso ordered her to give him in writing the story of her\nspiritual life.  The Saint readily obeyed, and began it in the\nmonastery of the Incarnation, and finished it in the house of\nDo\u00f1a Luisa de la Cerda, in Toledo, in the month of June, 1562.\nOn the 24th of August, the feast of St. Bartholomew, in the same\nyear, the Reform of the Carmelites began in the new monastery of\nSt. Joseph in Avila.\nWhat the Saint wrote for Fra Iba\u00f1ez has not been found.  It is,\nno doubt, substantially preserved in her Life, as we have it now,\nand is supposed to have reached no further than the end of\nch. xxxi.  What follows was added by direction of another\nDominican father, confessor of the Saint in the new monastery of\nSt. Joseph, Fra Garcia of Toledo, who, in 1562, bade her \"write\nthe history of that foundation, and other matters.\"\nBut as the Saint carried a heavy burden laid on her by God, a\nconstant fear of delusion, she had recourse about the same time\nto the Inquisitor Soto, who advised her to write a history of her\nlife, send it to Juan of Avila, the \"Apostle of Andalucia,\" and\nabide by his counsel.  As the direction of Fra Garcia of Toledo\nand the advice of the Inquisitor must have been given, according\nto her account, about the same time, the Life, as we have it now,\nmust have occupied her nearly six years in the writing of it,\nwhich may well be owing to her unceasing care in firmly\nestablishing the new monastery of St. Joseph.  The book at last\nwas sent to Blessed Juan of Avila by her friend Do\u00f1a Luisa de la\nCerda, and that great master of the spiritual life wrote the\nfollowing censure of it:\n\"The grace and peace of Jesus Christ be with you always.\n\"1. When I undertook to read the book sent me, it was not so much\nbecause I thought myself able to judge of it, as because I\nthought I might, by the grace of our Lord, learn something from\nthe teachings it contains: and praised be Christ; for, though I\nhave not been able to read it with the leisure it requires,\nI have been comforted by it, and might have been edified by it,\nif the fault had not been mine.  And although, indeed, I may have\nbeen comforted by it, without saying more, yet the respect due to\nthe subject and to the person who has sent it will not allow me,\nI think, to let it go back without giving my opinion on it, at\nleast in general.\n\"2. The book is not fit to be in the hands of everybody, for it\nis necessary to correct the language in some places, and explain\nit in others; and there are some things in it useful for your\nspiritual life and not so for others who might adopt them, for\nthe special ways by which God leads some souls are not meant for\nothers.  These points, or the greater number of them, I have\nmarked for the purpose of arranging them when I shall be able to\ndo so, and I shall not fail to send them to you; for if you were\naware of my infirmities and necessary occupations, I believe they\nwould make you pity me rather than blame me for the omission.\n\"3. The doctrine of prayer is for the most part sound, and you\nmay rely on it, and observe it; and the raptures I find to\npossess the tests of those which are true.  What you say of God's\nway of teaching the soul, without respect to the imagination and\nwithout interior locutions, is safe, and I find nothing to object\nto it.  St. Augustine speaks well of it.\n\"4. Interior locutions in these days have been a delusion of\nmany, and exterior locutions are the least safe.  It is easy\nenough to see when they proceed from ourselves, but to\ndistinguish between those of a good and those of an evil spirit\nis more difficult.  There are many rules given for finding out\nwhether they come from our Lord or not, and one of them is, that\nthey should be sent us in a time of need, or for some good end,\nas for the comforting a man under temptation or in doubt, or as a\nwarning of coming danger.  As a good man will not speak\nunadvisedly, neither will God; so, considering this, and that the\nlocutions are agreeable to the holy writings and the teaching of\nthe Church, my opinion is that the locutions mentioned in the\nbook came from God.\n\"5. Imaginary or bodily visions are those which are most\ndoubtful, and should in no wise be desired, and if they come\nundesired still they should be shunned as much as possible, yet\nnot by treating them with contempt, unless it be certain that\nthey come from an evil spirit; indeed, I was filled with horror,\nand greatly distressed, when I read of the gestures of contempt\nthat were made. [14]  People ought to entreat our Lord not to\nlead them by the way of visions, but to reserve for them in\nHeaven the blessed vision of Himself and the saints, and to guide\nthem here along the beaten path as He guides His faithful\nservants, and they must take other good measures for avoiding\nthese visions.\n\"6. But if the visions continue after all this is done, and if\nthe soul derives good from them, and if they do not lead to\nvanity, but deeper humility, and if the locutions be at one with\nthe teaching the Church, and if they continue for any time, and\nthat with inward satisfaction--better felt than described--there\nis no reason for avoiding them.  But no one ought to rely on his\nown judgment herein; he should make everything known to him who\ncan give him light.  That is the universal remedy to be had\nrecourse to in such matters, together with hope in God, Who will\nnot let a soul that wishes to be safe lie under a delusion, if it\nbe humble enough to yield obedience to the opinion of others.\n\"7. Nor should any one cause alarm by condemning them forthwith,\nbecause he sees that the person to whom they are granted is not\nperfect, for it is nothing new that our Lord in His goodness\nmakes wicked people just, yea, even grievous sinners; by giving\nthem to taste most deeply of His sweetness.  I have seen it so\nmyself.  Who will set bounds to the goodness of our\nLord?--especially when these graces are given, not for merit, nor\nbecause one is stronger; on the contrary, they are given to one\nbecause he is weaker; and as they do not make one more holy, they\nare not always given to the most holy.\n\"8. They are unreasonable who disbelieve these things merely\nbecause they are most high things, and because it seems to them\nincredible that infinite Majesty humbles Himself to these loving\nrelations with one of His creatures. It is written, God is love,\nand if He is love, then infinite love and infinite goodness, and\nwe must not be surprised if such a love and such a goodness\nbreaks out into such excesses of love as disturb those who know\nnothing of it.  And though many know of it by faith, still, as to\nthat special experience of the loving, and more than loving,\nconverse of God with whom He will, if not had, how deep it\nreaches can never be known; and so I have seen many persons\nscandalized at hearing of what God in His love does for His\ncreatures.  As they are themselves very far away from it, they\ncannot think that God will do for others what He is not doing for\nthem.  As this is an effect of love, and that a love which causes\nwonder, reason requires we should look upon it as a sign of its\nbeing from God, seeing that He is wonderful in His works, and\nmost especially in those of his compassion; but they take\noccasion from this to be distrustful, which should have been a\nground of confidence, when other circumstances combine as\nevidences of these visitations being good.\n\"9. It seems from the book, I think, that you have resisted, and\neven longer than was right.  I think, too, that these locutions\nhave done your soul good, and in particular that they have made\nyou see your own wretchedness and your faults more clearly, and\namend them.  They have lasted long, and always with spiritual\nprofit.  They move you to love God, and to despise yourself, and\nto do penance.  I see no reasons for condemning them, I incline\nrather to regard them as good, provided you are careful not to\nrely altogether on them, especially if they are unusual, or bid\nyou do something out of the way, or are not very plain.  In all\nthese and the like cases you must withhold your belief in them,\nand at once seek for direction.\n\"10. Also it should be considered that, even if they do come from\nGod, Satan may mix with them suggestions of his own; you should\ntherefore be always suspicious of them.  Also, when they are\nknown to be from God, men must not rest much on them, seeing that\nholiness does not lie in them, but in a humble love of God and\nour neighbour; everything else, however good, must be feared, and\nour efforts directed to the gaining of humility, goodness, and\nthe love of our Lord.  It is seemly, also, not to worship what is\nseen in these visions, but only Jesus Christ, either as in Heaven\nor in the Sacrament, or, if it be a vision of the Saints, then to\nlift up the heart to the Holy One in Heaven, and not to that\nwhich is presented to the imagination: let it suffice that the\nimagination may be made use of for the purpose of raising me up\nto that which it makes me see.\n\"11. I say, too, that the things mentioned in this book befall\nother persons even in this our day, and that there is great\ncertainty that they come from God, Whose arm is not shortened\nthat He cannot do now what He did in times past, and that in weak\nvessels, for His own glory.\n\"12. Go on your road, but always suspecting robbers, and asking\nfor the right way; give thanks to our Lord, Who has given you His\nlove, the knowledge of yourself, and a love of penance and the\ncross, making no account of these other things.  However, do not\ndespise them either, for there are signs that most of them come\nfrom our Lord, and those that do not come from Him will not hurt\nyou if you ask for direction.\n\"13. I cannot believe that I have written this in my own\nstrength, for I have none, but it is the effect of your prayers.\nI beg of you, for the love of Jesus Christ our Lord, to burden\nyourself with a prayer for me; He knows that I am asking this in\ngreat need, and I think that is enough to make you grant my\nrequest.  I ask your permission to stop now, for I am bound to\nwrite another letter.  May Jesus be glorified in all and\nby all! Amen.\n\"Your servant, for Christ's sake.\n\"Juan de Avila\n\"Montilla, 12th Sept., 1568.\"\nHer confessors, having seen the book, \"commanded her to make\ncopies of it,\" [15] one of which has been traced into the\npossession of the Duke and Duchess of Alva.\nThe Princess of Eboli, in 1569, obtained a copy from the Saint\nherself, after much importunity; but it was more out of vanity or\ncuriosity, it is to be feared, than from any real desire to learn\nthe story of the Saint's spiritual life, that the Princess\ndesired the boon.  She and her husband promised to keep it from\nthe knowledge of others, but the promise given was not kept.\nThe Saint heard within a few days later that the book was in the\nhands of the servants of the Princess, who was angry with the\nSaint because she had refused to admit, at the request of the\nPrincess, an Augustinian nun into the Order of Carmel in the new\nfoundation of Pastrana.  The contents of the book were bruited\nabroad, and the visions and revelations of the Saint were said to\nbe of a like nature with those of Magdalene of the Cross, a\ndeluded and deluding nun.  The gossip in the house of the\nPrincess was carried to Madrid, and the result was that the\nInquisition began to make a search for the book. [16]  It is not\nquite clear, however, that it was seized at this time.\nThe Princess became a widow in July, 1573, and insisted on\nbecoming a Carmelite nun in the house she and her husband, Ruy\nGomez, had founded in Pastrana.  When the news of her resolve\nreached the monastery, the mother-prioress, Isabel of St.\nDominic, exclaimed, \"The Princess a nun! I look on the house as\nruined.\"  The Princess came, and insisted on her right as\nfoundress; she had compelled a friar to give her the habit before\nher husband was buried, and when she came to Pastrana she began\nher religious life by the most complete disobedience and\ndisregard of common propriety.  Don Vicente's description of her\nis almost literally correct, though intended only for a general\nsummary of her most childish conduct:\n\"On the death of the Prince of Eboli, the Princess would become a\nnun in her monastery of Pastrana.  The first day she had a fit of\nviolent fervour; on the next she relaxed the rule; on the third\nshe broke it, and conversed with secular people within the\ncloisters.  She was also so humble that she required the nuns to\nspeak to her on their knees, and insisted upon their receiving\ninto the house as religious whomsoever she pleased.\nHereupon complaints were made to St. Teresa, who remonstrated\nwith the Princess, and showed her how much she was in the wrong,\nwhereupon she replied that the monastery was hers; but the Saint\nproved to her that the nuns were not, and had them removed\nto Segovia.\" [17]\nThe nuns were withdrawn from Pastrana in April, 1574, and then\nthe anger of the Princess prevailed; she sent the Life of the\nSaint, which she had still in her possession, to the Inquisition,\nand denounced it as a book containing visions, revelations, and\ndangerous doctrines, which the Inquisitors should look into and\nexamine: The book was forthwith given to theologians for\nexamination, and two Dominican friars, of whom Ba\u00f1es was one,\nwere delegated censors of it by the\u00a0Inquisition. [18]\nFra Ba\u00f1es did not know the Saint when he undertook her defence in\nAvila against the authorities of the city, eager to destroy the\nmonastery of St. Joseph; [19] but from that time forth he was one\nof her most faithful friends, strict and even severe, as became a\nwise director who had a great Saint for his penitent.\nHe testifies in the process of her beatification that he was firm\nand sharp with her; while she herself was the more desirous of\nhis counsel, the more he humbled her, and the less he appeared to\nesteem her. [20]  When he found that copies of her life were in\nthe hands of secular people,--he had probably also heard of the\nmisconduct of the Princess of Eboli,--he showed his displeasure\nto the Saint, and told her he would burn the book, it being\nunseemly that the writings of women should be made public.\nThe Saint left it in his hands, but Fra Ba\u00f1es, struck with her\nhumility, had not the courage to burn it; he sent it to the Holy\nOffice in Madrid. [21]  Thus the book was in a sense denounced\ntwice,--once by an enemy, the second time by a friend, to save\nit.  Both the Saint and her confessor, Fra Ba\u00f1es, state that the\ncopy given up by the latter was sent to the Inquisition in\nMadrid, and Fra Ba\u00f1es says so twice in his deposition.\nThe Inquisitor Soto returned the copy to Fra Ba\u00f1es, desiring him\nto read it, and give his opinion thereon.  Fra Ba\u00f1es did so, and\nwrote his \"censure\" of the book on the blank leaves at the end.\nThat censure still remains, and is one of the most important,\nbecause given during the lifetime of the Saint, and while many\npersons were crying out against her.  Ba\u00f1es wished it had been\npublished when the Saint's Life was given to the world by Fra\nLuis de Leon; but notwithstanding its value, and its being\npreserved in the book which is in the handwriting of the Saint,\nno one before Don Vicente made it known.  It was easy enough to\npraise the writings of St. Teresa, and to admit her sanctity,\nafter her death.  Fra Ba\u00f1es had no external help in the applause\nof the many, and he had to judge the book as a theologian, and\nthe Saint as one of his ordinary penitents.  When he wrote, he\nwrote like a man whose whole life was spent, as he tells us\nhimself, \"in lecturing and disputing.\" [22]\nThat censure is as follows:\n\"1. This book, wherein Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite nun, and\nfoundress of the Barefooted Carmelites, gives a plain account of\nthe state of her soul, in order to be taught and directed by her\nconfessors, has been examined by me, and with much attention, and\nI have not found anywhere in it anything which, in my opinion, is\nerroneous in doctrine.  On the contrary, there are many things in\nit highly edifying and instructive for those who give themselves\nto prayer.  The great experience of this religious, her\ndiscretion also and her humility, which made her always seek for\nlight and learning in her confessors, enabled her to speak with\nan accuracy on the subject of prayer that the most learned men,\nthrough their want of experience, have not always attained to.\nOne thing only there is about the book that may reasonably cause\nany hesitation till it shall be very carefully examined;\nit contains many visions and revelations, matters always to be\nafraid of, especially in women, who are very ready to believe of\nthem that they come from God, and to look on them as proofs of\nsanctity, though sanctity does not lie in them.  On the contrary,\nthey should be regarded as dangerous trials for those who are\naiming at perfection, because Satan is wont to transform himself\ninto an angel of light, [23] and to deceive souls which are\ncurious and of scant humility, as we have seen in our day:\nnevertheless, we must not therefore lay down a general rule that\nall revelations and visions come from the devil.  If it were so,\nSt. Paul could not have said that Satan transforms himself into\nan angel of light, if the angel of light did not sometimes\nenlighten us.\n\"2. Saints, both men and women, have had revelations, not only in\nancient, but also in modern times; such were St. Dominic,\nSt. Francis, St. Vincent Ferrer, St. Catherine of Siena,\nSt. Gertrude, and many others that might be named; and as the\nChurch of God is, and is to be, always holy to the end, not only\nbecause her profession is holiness, but because there are in her\njust persons and perfect in holiness, it is unreasonable to\ndespise visions and revelations, and condemn them in one sweep,\nseeing they are ordinarily accompanied with much goodness and a\nChristian life.  On the contrary, we should follow the saying of\nthe Apostle in 1 Thess. v. 19-22: 'Spiritum nolite extinguere.\nProphetias nolite spernere.  Omnia [autem] probate: quod bonum\nest tenete.  Ab omni specie mala abstinete vos.'  He who will\nread St. Thomas on that passage will see how carefully they are\nto be examined who, in the Church of God, manifest any particular\ngift that may be profitable or hurtful to our neighbour, and how\nwatchful the examiners ought to be lest the fire of the Spirit of\nGod should be quenched in the good, and others cowed in the\npractices of the perfect Christian life.\n\"3. Judging by the revelations made to her, this woman, even\nthough she may be deceived in something, is at least not herself\na deceiver, because she tells all the good and the bad so simply,\nand with so great a wish to be correct, that no doubt can be made\nas to her good intention; and the greater the reason for trying\nspirits of this kind, because there are persons in our day who\nare deceivers with the appearance of piety, the more necessary it\nis to defend those who, with the appearance, have also the\nreality, of piety.  For it is a strange thing to see how lax and\nworldly people delight in seeing those discredited who have an\nappearance of goodness.  God complained of old, by the Prophet\nEzekiel, ch. xiii., of those false prophets who made the just to\nmourn and who flattered sinners, saying: 'Maerere fecisti cor\njusti mendaciter, quem Ego non contristavi: et comfortastis manus\nimpii.'  In a certain sense this may be said of those who\nfrighten souls who are going on by the way of prayer and\nperfection, telling them that this way is singular and full of\ndanger, that many who went by it have fallen into delusions, and\nthat the safest way is that which is plain and common, travelled\nby all.\n\"4. Words of this kind, clearly, sadden the hearts of those who\nwould observe the counsels of perfection in continual prayer, so\nfar as it is possible for them, and in much fasting, watching,\nand disciplines; and, on the other hand, the lax and the wicked\ntake courage and lose the fear of God, because they consider the\nway on which they are travelling as the safer: and this is their\ndelusion,--they call that a plain and safe road which is the\nabsence of the knowledge and consideration of the dangers and\nprecipices amidst which we are all of us journeying in this\nworld.  Nevertheless, there is no other security than that which\nlies in our knowing our daily enemies, and in humbly imploring\nthe compassion of God, if we would not be their prisoners.\nBesides, there are souls whom God, in a way, constrains to enter\non the way of perfection, and who, if they relaxed in their\nfervour, could not keep a middle course, but would immediately\nfall into the other extreme of sins, and for souls of this kind\nit is of the utmost necessity that they should watch and pray\nwithout ceasing; and, in short, there is nobody whom lukewarmness\ndoes not injure.  Let every man examine his own conscience, and\nhe will find this to be the truth.\n\"5. I firmly believe that if God for a time bears with the\nlukewarm, it is owing to the prayers of the fervent, who are\ncontinually crying, 'et ne nos inducas in tentationem.'  I have\nsaid this, not for the purpose of honouring those whom we see\nwalking in the way of contemplation; for it is another extreme\ninto which the world falls, and a covert persecution of goodness,\nto pronounce those holy forthwith who have the appearance of it.\nFor that would be to furnish them with motives for vain-glory,\nand would do little honour to goodness; on the contrary, it would\nexpose it to great risks, because, when they fall who have been\nobjects of praise, the honour of goodness suffers more than if\nthose people had not been so esteemed.  And so I look upon this\nexaggeration of their holiness who are still living in the world\nto be a temptation of Satan.  That we should have a good opinion\nof the servants of God is most just, but let us consider them\nalways as people in danger, however good they may be, and that\ntheir goodness is not so evident that we can be sure of it\neven now.\n\"6. Considering myself that what I have said is true, I have\nalways proceeded cautiously in the examination of this account of\nthe prayer and life of this nun, and no one has been more\nincredulous than myself as to her visions and revelations,--not\nso, however as to her goodness and her good desires, for herein I\nhave had great experience of her truthfulness, her obedience,\nmortification, patience, and charity towards her persecutors, and\nof her other virtues, which any one who will converse with her\nwill discern; and this is what may be regarded as a more certain\nproof of her real love of God than these visions and revelations.\nI do not, however, undervalue her visions, revelations, and\necstasies; on the contrary, I suspect them to be the work of God,\nas they have been in others who were Saints.  But in this case it\nis always safer to be afraid and wary; for if she is confident\nabout them, Satan will take occasion to interfere, and that which\nwas once, perhaps, the work of God, may be changed into something\nelse, and that will be the devil's.\n\"7. I am of opinion that this book is not to be shown to every\none, but only to men of learning, experience, and Christian\ndiscretion.  It perfectly answers the purpose for which it was\nwritten, namely, that the nun should give an account of the state\nof her soul to those who had the charge of it, in order that she\nmight not fall into delusions.  Of one thing I am very sure, so\nfar as it is possible for a man to be,--she is not a deceiver;\nshe deserves, therefore, for her sincerity, that all should be\nfavourable to her in her good purposes and good works.\nFor within the last thirteen years she has, I believe, founded a\ndozen monasteries of Barefooted Carmelite nuns, the austerity and\nperfection of which are exceeded by none other; of which they who\nhave been visitors of them, as the Dominican Provincial, master\nin theology, [24] Fra Pedro Fernandez, the master Fra Hernando\ndel Castillo, and many others, speak highly.  This is what I\nthink, at present, concerning the censure of this book,\nsubmitting my judgment herein to that of Holy Church our mother,\nand her ministers.\n\"Given in the College of St. Gregory, Valladolid, on the sixth\nday of July, 1575.\n\"Fra Domingo Ba\u00f1es.\"\nThe book remained in the keeping of the Inquisition, and the\nSaint never saw it again.  But she heard of it from the\nArchbishop of Toledo, Cardinal Quiroga, President of the Supreme\nCourt of the Inquisition, when she applied to him for license to\nfound a monastery in Madrid.  Jerome of the Mother of God was\nwith her; and heard the Cardinal's reply.  His Eminence said he\nwas glad to see her; that a book of hers had been in the Holy\nOffice for some years, and had been rigorously examined; that he\nhad read it himself, and regarded it as containing sound and\nwholesome doctrine.  He would grant the license, and do whatever\nhe could for the Saint.  When she heard this, she wished to\npresent a petition to the Inquisition for the restitution of her\nbook; but Gratian thought it better to apply to the Duke of Alba\nfor the copy which he had, and which the Inquisitors had allowed\nhim to retain and read.  The Duke gave his book to Fra Jerome,\nwho had copies of it made for the use of the monasteries both of\nmen and women. [25]\nAnne of Jesus, in 1586, founding a monastery of her Order in\nMadrid,--the Saint had died in 1582,--made inquiries about the\nbook, and applied to the Inquisition for it, for she was resolved\nto publish the writings of her spiritual mother.  The Inquisitors\nmade no difficulty, and consented to the publication.  In this\nshe was seconded by the Empress Maria, daughter of Charles V.,\nand widow of Maximilian II., who had obtained one of the copies\nwhich Fra Jerome of the Mother of God had ordered to be made.\nFra Nicholas Doria, then Provincial, asked Fra Luis de Leon, the\nAugustinian, to edit the book, who consented.  He was allowed to\ncompare the copy furnished him with the original in the keeping\nof the Inquisition; but his edition has not been considered\naccurate, notwithstanding the facilities given him, and his great\nreverence for the Saint. It was published in Salamanca,\nA.D. 1588.\nWith the Life of the Saint, Fra Luis de Leon received certain\npapers in the handwriting of the Saint, which he published as an\nadditional chapter.  Whether he printed all he received, or\nmerely made extracts, may be doubtful, but anyhow that chapter is\nsingularly incomplete.  Don Vicente de la Fuente, from whose\nedition (Madrid, 1861, 1862) this translation has been made,\nomitted the additional chapter of Fra Luis de Leon, contrary to\nthe practice of his predecessors.  But he has done more, for he\nhas traced the paragraphs of that chapter to their sources, and\nhas given us now a collection of papers which form almost another\nLife of the Saint, to which he has given their old name of\nRelations, [26] the name which the Saint herself had given\nthem. [27]  Some of them are usually printed among the Saint's\nletters, and portions of some of the others are found in the\nLives of the Saint written by Ribera and Yepes, and in the\nChronicle of the Order; the rest was published for the first time\nby Don Vicente: the arrangement of the whole is due to him.\nThe Relations are ten in the Spanish edition, and eleven in the\ntranslation.  The last, the eleventh, has hitherto been left\namong the letters, and Don Vicente, seemingly not without some\nhesitation, so left it; but as it is of the like nature with the\nRelations, it has now been added to them.\nThe original text, in the handwriting of the Saint, is preserved\nin the Escurial, not in the library, but among the relics of the\nChurch.  Don Vicente examined it at his leisure, and afterwards\nfound in the National Library in Madrid an authentic and exact\ntranscript of it, made by order of Ferdinand VI.  His edition is,\ntherefore, far better than any of its predecessors; but it is\npossible that even now there may still remain some verbal errors\nfor future editors to correct.  The most conscientious diligence\nis not a safeguard against mistakes.  F. Bouix says that in\nch. xxxiv. \u00a7 12, the reading of the original differs from that of\nthe printed editions; yet Don Vicente takes no notice of it, and\nretains the common reading. It is impossible to believe that\nF. Bouix has stated as a fact that which is not.  Again, in\nch. xxxix. \u00a7 29, the printed editions have after the words, \"Thou\nart Mine, and I am thine,\" \"I am in the habit\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. sincerity;\"\nbut Don Vicente omits them.  This may have been an oversight, for\nin general he points out in his notes all the discrepancies\nbetween the printed editions and the original text.\nA new translation of the Life of St. Teresa seems called for now,\nbecause the original text has been collated since the previous\ntranslations were made, and also because those translations are\nexceedingly scarce.  The first is believed to be this--it is a\nsmall quarto:\n\"The Lyf of the Mother Teresa of Jesus, Foundresse of the\nMonasteries of the Discalced or Bare-footed Carmelite Nunnes and\nFryers of the First Rule.\n\"Written by herself at the commaundement of her ghostly father,\nand now translated into English out of Spanish.  By W.M., of the\nSociety of Jesus.\n\"Imprinted in Antwerp by Henry Jaye.  Anno MDCXI.\"\nSome thirty years afterwards, Sir Tobias Matthew, S.J.,\ndissatisfied, as he says, with the former translation, published\nanother, with the following title; the volume is a small octavo\nin form:\n\"The Flaming Hart, or the Life of the glorious St. Teresa,\nFoundresse of the Reformation of the Order of the All-Immaculate\nVirgin Mother, our B. Lady of Mount Carmel.\n\"This History of her Life was written by the Saint in Spanish,\nand is newly translated into English in the year of our Lord\nGod 1642.\n'Aut mori aut pati:\nEither to dye or else to suffer.'--Chap. xl.\n\"Antwerpe, printed by Joannes Meursius.  Anno MDCXLII.\"\nThe next translation was made by Abraham Woodhead, and published\nin 1671, without the name of the translator, or of the printer,\nor of the place of publication.  It is in quarto, and bears the\nfollowing title:\n\"The Life of the Holy Mother St. Teresa, Foundress of the\nReformation of the Discalced Carmelites according to the\nPrimitive Rule.  Printed in the year MDCLXXI.\"\nIt is not said that the translation was made from the Spanish,\nand there are grounds for thinking it to have been made from the\nItalian.  Ch. xxxii. is broken off at the end of \u00a7 10; and\nch. xxxiii., therefore, is ch. xxxvii.  That which is there\nomitted has been thrown into the Book of the Foundations, which,\nin the translation of Mr. Woodhead, begins with \u00a7 11 of\nch. xxxii. of the Life, as it also does in the Italian\ntranslation. It is due, however, to Mr. Woodhead to say that he\nhas printed five of the Relations separately, not as letters, but\nas what they really are, and with that designation.\nThe last translation is that of the Very Reverend John Dalton,\nCanon of Northampton, which is now, though twice published,\nalmost as scarce as its predecessors.  The title is:\n\"The Life of St. Teresa, written by herself, and translated\nfrom the Spanish by the Rev. John Dalton.  London, MDCCCLI.\"\nSeptuagesima, 1870.\n1. Fr.

Returns to Avila and takes possession of the\nnew monastery, August 24.  Troubles in Avila.  The Saint ordered\nback to the monastery of the Incarnation.  Is commanded by Fra\nGarcia of Toledo to write the history of the foundation of\nSt. Joseph.\n1. In the same year St. Philip was born in Florence.  St. Teresa\ndied in 1582, and St. Philip in 1595; but they were canonised on\nthe same day, with St. Isidore, St. Ignatius, and St. Francis\nXavier.  The three latter were joined together in the three final\nconsistories held before the solemn proclamation of their\nsanctity, and St. Teresa and St. Philip were joined together in\nthe same way in the final consistories held specially, as usual,\nfor them.\n2. This must be an error.  See ch. i. \u00a7 7, note 7.\n3. There is a difficulty about this.  The Bollandists maintain\nthat she went to the monastery of the Incarnation in the year\n1533.  On the other hand Ribera, her most accurate\nbiographer--with whom Fra Jerome agrees,--says that she left her\nfather's house in 1535, when she was more than twenty years of\nage; Yepes, that she was not yet twenty; and the Second Relation\nof the Rota, that she was in her twentieth year.  The Bull of\nCanonisation and the Office in the Breviary also say that she was\nin her twentieth year, that is, A.D. 1534.  The Chronicler of the\nOrder differs from all and assigns the year 1536 as the year in\nwhich she entered the monastery.\nThe Life\nof the\nHoly Mother Teresa of Jesus.\nWritten by Herself.\nPrologue.\nAs I have been commanded and left at liberty to describe at\nlength my way of prayer, and the workings of the grace of our\nLord within me, I could wish that I had been allowed at the same\ntime to speak distinctly and in detail of my grievous sins and\nwicked life.  But it has not been so willed; on the contrary, I\nam laid herein under great restraint; and therefore, for the love\nof our Lord, I beg of every one who shall read this story of my\nlife [1] to keep in mind how wicked it has been; and how, among\nthe Saints who were converted to God, I have never found one in\nwhom I can have any comfort.  For I see that they, after our Lord\nhad called them, never fell into sin again; I not only became\nworse, but, as it seems to me, deliberately withstood the graces\nof His Majesty, because I saw that I was thereby bound to serve\nHim more earnestly, knowing, at the same time, that of myself I\ncould not pay the least portion of my debt.\nMay He be blessed for ever Who waited for me so long! I implore\nHim with my whole heart to send me His grace, so that in all\nclearness and truth I may give this account of myself which my\nconfessors command me to give; and even our Lord Himself, I know\nit, has also willed it should be given for some time past, but I\nhad not the courage to attempt it.  And I pray it may be to His\npraise and glory, and a help to my confessors; who, knowing me\nbetter, may succour my weakness, so that I may render to our Lord\nsome portion of the service I owe Him.  May all creatures praise\nHim for ever! Amen.\n1. The Saint, in a letter written November 19, 1581, to Don Pedro\nde Castro, then canon of Avila, speaking of this book, calls it\nthe book \"Of the compassions of God\"--Y ansi intitule ese libro\nDe las Misericordias de Dios.  That letter is the 358th in the\nedition of Don Vicente de la Fuente, and the 8th of the fourth\nvolume of the Doblado edition of Madrid.  \"Vitam igitur suam\ninternam et supernaturalem magis pandit quam narrat actiones\nsuas mere humanas\" (Bollandists, n. 2).\nChapter I.\nChildhood and Early Impressions.  The Blessing of Pious Parents.\nDesire of Martyrdom.  Death of the Saint's Mother.\n1. I had a father and mother, who were devout and feared God.\nOur Lord also helped me with His grace.  All this would have been\nenough to make me good, if I had not been so wicked.  My father\nwas very much given to the reading of good books; and so he had\nthem in Spanish, that his children might read them.  These books,\nwith my mother's carefulness to make us say our prayers, and to\nbring us up devout to our Lady and to certain Saints, began to\nmake me think seriously when I was, I believe, six or seven years\nold.  It helped me, too, that I never saw my father and mother\nrespect anything but goodness.  They were very good themselves.\nMy father was a man of great charity towards the poor, and\ncompassion for the sick, and also for servants; so much so, that\nhe never could be persuaded to keep slaves, for he pitied them so\nmuch: and a slave belonging to one of his brothers being once in\nhis house, was treated by him with as much tenderness as his own\nchildren.  He used to say that he could not endure the pain of\nseeing that she was not free.  He was a man of great\ntruthfulness; nobody ever heard him swear or speak ill of any\none; his life was most pure.\n2. My mother also was a woman of great goodness, and her life was\nspent in great infirmities.  She was singularly pure in all her\nways.  Though possessing great beauty, yet was it never known\nthat she gave reason to suspect that she made any account\nwhatever of it; for, though she was only three-and-thirty years\nof age when she died, her apparel was already that of a woman\nadvanced in years.  She was very calm, and had great sense.\nThe sufferings she went through during her life were grievous,\nher death most Christian. [1]\n3. We were three sisters and nine brothers. [2]  All, by the\nmercy of God, resembled their parents in goodness except myself,\nthough I was the most cherished of my father.  And, before I\nbegan to offend God, I think he had some reason,--for I am filled\nwith sorrow whenever I think of the good desires with which our\nLord inspired me, and what a wretched use I made of them.\nBesides, my brothers never in any way hindered me in the service\nof God.\n4. One of my brothers was nearly of my own age; [3] and he it was\nwhom I most loved, though I was very fond of them all, and they\nof me.  He and I used to read Lives of Saints together.  When I\nread of martyrdom undergone by the Saints for the love of God, it\nstruck me that the vision of God was very cheaply purchased; and\nI had a great desire to die a martyr's death,--not out of any\nlove of Him of which I was conscious, but that I might most\nquickly attain to the fruition of those great joys of which I\nread that they were reserved in Heaven; and I used to discuss\nwith my brother how we could become martyrs.  We settled to go\ntogether to the country of the Moors, [4] begging our way for the\nlove of God, that we might be there beheaded; [5] and our Lord, I\nbelieve, had given us courage enough, even at so tender an age,\nif we could have found the means to proceed; but our greatest\ndifficulty seemed to be our father and mother.\n5. It astonished us greatly to find it said in what we were\nreading that pain and bliss were everlasting.  We happened very\noften to talk about this; and we had a pleasure in repeating\nfrequently, \"For ever, ever, ever.\"  Through the constant\nuttering of these words, our Lord was pleased that I should\nreceive an abiding impression of the way of truth when I was yet\na child.\n6. As soon as I saw it was impossible to go to any place where\npeople would put me to death for the sake of God, my brother and\nI set about becoming hermits; and in an orchard belonging to the\nhouse we contrived, as well as we could, to build hermitages, by\npiling up small stones one on the other, which fell down\nimmediately; and so it came to pass that we found no means of\naccomplishing our wish.  Even now, I have a feeling of devotion\nwhen I consider how God gave me in my early youth what I lost by\nmy own fault.  I gave alms as I could--and I could but little.\nI contrived to be alone, for the sake of saying my\nprayers [6]--and they were many--especially the Rosary, to which\nmy mother had a great devotion, and had made us also in this like\nherself.  I used to delight exceedingly, when playing with other\nchildren, in the building of monasteries, as if we were nuns; and\nI think I wished to be a nun, though not so much as I did to be a\nmartyr or a hermit.\n7. I remember that, when my mother died, [7] I was about twelve\nyears old--a little less.  When I began to understand my loss, I\nwent in my affliction to an image of our Lady, [8] and with many\ntears implored her to be my mother.  I did this in my simplicity,\nand I believe that it was of service to me; for I have by\nexperience found the royal Virgin help me whenever I recommended\nmyself to her; and at last she has brought me back to herself.\nIt distresses me now, when I think of, and reflect on, that which\nkept me from being earnest in the good desires with which\nI began.\n8. O my Lord, since Thou art determined to save me--may it be the\npleasure of Thy Majesty to effect it!--and to bestow upon me so\nmany graces, why has it not been Thy pleasure also--not for my\nadvantage, but for Thy greater honour--that this habitation,\nwherein Thou hast continually to dwell, should not have\ncontracted so much defilement?  It distresses me even to say\nthis, O my Lord, because I know the fault is all my own, seeing\nthat Thou hast left nothing undone to make me, even from my\nyouth, wholly Thine.  When I would complain of my parents, I\ncannot do it; for I saw nothing in them but all good, and\ncarefulness for my welfare.  Then, growing up, I began to\ndiscover the natural gifts which our Lord had given me--they were\nsaid to be many; and, when I should have given Him thanks for\nthem, I made use of every one of them, as I shall now explain, to\noffend Him.\n1. See ch. xxxvii. \u00a7 1; where the Saint says that she saw them in\na vision both in Heaven.\n2. Alfonso Sanchez de Cepeda, father of the Saint, married first\nCatalina del Peso y Henao, and had three children--one daughter,\nMaria de Cepeda, and two sons.  After the death of Catalina, he\nmarried Beatriz Davila y Ahumada, by whom he had nine\nchildren--seven boys and two girls.  The third of these, and the\neldest of the daughters, was the Saint, Do\u00f1a Teresa Sanchez\nCepeda Davila y Ahumada.  In the Monastery of the Incarnation,\nwhere she was a professed nun for twenty-eight years, she was\nknown as Do\u00f1a Teresa; but in the year 1563, when she left her\nmonastery for the new foundation of St. Joseph, of the Reform of\nthe Carmelites, she took for the first time the name of Teresa of\nJesus (De la Fuente).  The Saint was born March 28, 1515, and\nbaptized on the 4th of April, in the church of St. John; on which\nday Mass was said for the first time in the Monastery of the\nIncarnation, where the Saint made her profession.  Her godfather\nwas Vela Nu\u00f1ez, and her godmother Do\u00f1a Maria del Aguila.\nThe Bollandists and Father Bouix say that she was baptized on the\nvery day of her birth.  But the testimony of Do\u00f1a Maria de Pinel,\na nun in the Monastery of the Incarnation, is clear: and Don\nVicente de La Fuente, quoting it, vol. i. p. 549, says that this\ndelay of baptism was nothing singular in those days, provided\nthere was no danger of death.\n3. Rodrigo de Cepeda, four years older than the Saint, entered\nthe army, and, serving in South America, was drowned in the river\nPlate, Rio de la Plata.  St. Teresa always considered him a\nmartyr, because he died in defence of the Catholic faith (Ribera,\nlib. i. ch. iii.).  Before he sailed for the Indies, he made his\nwill, and left all his property to the Saint, his sister (Reforma\nde los Descal\u00e7os, vol. i. lib. i. ch. iii. \u00a7 4).\n4. The Bollandists incline to believe that St. Teresa may not\nhave intended to quit Spain, because all the Moors were not at\nthat time driven out of the country.  The Bull of the Saint's\ncanonization, and the Lections of the Breviary, say that she left\nher father's house, ut in Africam trajiceret.\n5. The two children set out on their strange journey--one of them\nseven, the other eleven, years old--through the Adaja Gate; but\nwhen they had crossed the bridge, they were met by one of their\nuncles, who brought them back to their mother, who had already\nsent through Avila in quest of them.  Rodrigo, like Adam, excused\nhimself, and laid the blame on the woman (Ribera,\nlib. i. ch. iii.).  Francisco de Santa Maria, chronicler of the\nOrder, says that the uncle was Francisco Alvarez de Cepeda\n(Reforma de los Descal\u00e7os, lib. i. ch. v. \u00a7 4).\n6. She was also marvellously touched by the story of the\nSamaritan woman at the well, of whom there was a picture in her\nroom (Ribera, lib. i. ch. iv.).  She speaks of this later on.\n(See ch. xxx. \u00a7 24.)\n7. The last will and testament of Do\u00f1a Beatriz de Ahumada was\nmade November 24, 1528 and she may have died soon after.\nIf there be no mistake in the copy of that instrument, the Saint\nmust have been more than twelve years old at that time.\nDon Vicente, in a note, says, with the Bollandists, that Do\u00f1a\nBeatriz died at the end of the year 1526, or in the beginning of\n1527; but it is probable that, when he wrote that note, he had\nnot read the copy of the will, which he has printed in the first\nvolume of the Saint's writings, p. 550.\n8. Our Lady of Charity, in the church of the hospital where\nthe poor and pilgrims were received in Avila (Bouix).\nChapter II.\nEarly Impressions.  Dangerous Books and Companions.  The Saint Is\nPlaced in a Monastery.\n1. What I shall now speak of was, I believe, the beginning of\ngreat harm to me.  I often think how wrong it is of parents not\nto be very careful that their children should always, and in\nevery way, see only that which is good; for though my mother was,\nas I have just said, so good herself, nevertheless I, when I came\nto the use of reason, did not derive so much good from her as I\nought to have done--almost none at all; and the evil I learned\ndid me much harm.  She was very fond of books of chivalry; but\nthis pastime did not hurt her so much as it hurt me, because she\nnever wasted her time on them; only we, her children, were left\nat liberty to read them; and perhaps she did this to distract her\nthoughts from her great sufferings, and occupy her children, that\nthey might not go astray in other ways.  It annoyed my father so\nmuch, that we had to be careful he never saw us.  I contracted a\nhabit of reading these books; and this little fault which I\nobserved in my mother was the beginning of lukewarmness in my\ngood desires, and the occasion of my falling away in other\nrespects.  I thought there was no harm in it when I wasted many\nhours night and day in so vain an occupation, even when I kept it\na secret from my father.  So completely was I mastered by this\npassion, that I thought I could never be happy without a\nnew book.\n2. I began to make much of dress, to wish to please others by my\nappearance.  I took pains with my hands and my hair, used\nperfumes, and all vanities within my reach--and they were many,\nfor I was very much given to them.  I had no evil intention,\nbecause I never wished any one to offend God for me.\nThis fastidiousness of excessive neatness [1] lasted some years;\nand so also did other practices, which I thought then were not at\nall sinful; now, I see how wrong all this must have been.\n3. I had some cousins; for into my father's house no others were\nallowed an entrance.  In this he was very cautious; and would to\nGod he had been cautious about them!--for I see now the danger of\nconversing, at an age when virtue should begin to grow, with\npersons who, knowing nothing themselves of the vanity of the\nworld, provoke others to throw themselves into the midst of it.\nThese cousins were nearly of mine own age--a little older,\nperhaps.  We were always together; and they had a great affection\nfor me.  In everything that gave them pleasure, I kept the\nconversation alive,--listened to the stories of their affections\nand childish follies, good for nothing; and, what was still\nworse, my soul began to give itself up to that which was the\ncause of all its disorders.  If I were to give advice, I would\nsay to parents that they ought to be very careful whom they allow\nto mix with their children when young; for much mischief thence\nensues, and our natural inclinations are unto evil rather than\nunto good.\n4. So it was with me; for I had a sister much older than\nmyself, [2] from whose modesty and goodness, which were great, I\nlearned nothing; and learned every evil from a relative who was\noften in the house.  She was so light and frivolous, that my\nmother took great pains to keep her out of the house, as if she\nforesaw the evil I should learn from her; but she could not\nsucceed, there being so many reasons for her coming.  I was very\nfond of this person's company, gossiped and talked with her; for\nshe helped me in all the amusements I liked, and, what is more,\nfound some for me, and communicated to me her own conversations\nand her vanities.  Until I knew her, I mean, until she became\nfriendly with me, and communicated to me her own affairs--I was\nthen about fourteen years old, a little more, I think--I do not\nbelieve that I turned away from God in mortal sin, or lost the\nfear of Him, though I had a greater fear of disgrace.\nThis latter fear had such sway over me, that I never wholly\nforfeited my good name--and, as to that, there was nothing in the\nworld for which I would have bartered it, and nobody in the world\nI liked well enough who could have persuaded me to do it.  Thus I\nmight have had the strength never to do anything against the\nhonour of God, as I had it by nature not to fail in that wherein\nI thought the honour of the world consisted; and I never observed\nthat I was failing in many other ways.  In vainly seeking after\nit I was extremely careful; but in the use of the means necessary\nfor preserving it I was utterly careless. I was anxious only not\nto be lost altogether.\n5. This friendship distressed my father and sister exceedingly.\nThey often blamed me for it; but, as they could not hinder that\nperson from coming into the house, all their efforts were in\nvain; for I was very adroit in doing anything that was wrong.\nNow and then, I am amazed at the evil one bad companion can\ndo,--nor could I believe it if I did not know it by\nexperience,--especially when we are young: then is it that the\nevil must be greatest.  Oh, that parents would take warning by\nme, and look carefully to this! So it was; the conversation of\nthis person so changed me, that no trace was left of my soul's\nnatural disposition to virtue, and I became a reflection of her\nand of another who was given to the same kind of amusements.\n6. I know from this the great advantage of good companions; and I\nam certain that if at that tender age I had been thrown among\ngood people, I should have persevered in virtue; for if at that\ntime I had found any one to teach me the fear of God, my soul\nwould have grown strong enough not to fall away. Afterwards, when\nthe fear of God had utterly departed from me, the fear of\ndishonour alone remained, and was a torment to me in all I did.\nWhen I thought that nobody would ever know, I ventured upon many\nthings that were neither honourable nor pleasing unto God.\n7. In the beginning, these conversations did me harm--I believe\nso.  The fault was perhaps not hers, but mine; for afterwards my\nown wickedness was enough to lead me astray, together with the\nservants about me, whom I found ready enough for all evil.\nIf any one of these had given me good advice, I might perhaps\nhave profited by it; but they were blinded by interest, as I was\nby passion.  Still, I was never inclined to much evil,--for I\nhated naturally anything dishonourable,--but only to the\namusement of a pleasant conversation.  The occasion of sin,\nhowever, being present, danger was at hand, and I exposed to it\nmy father and brothers.  God delivered me out of it all, so that\nI should not be lost, in a manner visibly against my will, yet\nnot so secretly as to allow me to escape without the loss of my\ngood name and the suspicions of my father.\n8. I had not spent, I think, three months in these vanities, when\nthey took me to a monastery [3] in the city where I lived, in\nwhich children like myself were brought up, though their way of\nlife was not so wicked as mine.  This was done with the utmost\nconcealment of the true reason, which was known only to myself\nand one of my kindred.  They waited for an opportunity which\nwould make the change seem nothing out of the way; for, as my\nsister was married, it was not fitting I should remain alone,\nwithout a mother, in the house.\n9. So excessive was my father's love for me, and so deep my\ndissembling, that he never would believe me to be so wicked as I\nwas; and hence I was never in disgrace with him.  Though some\nremarks were made, yet, as the time had been short, nothing could\nbe positively asserted; and, as I was so much afraid about my\ngood name, I had taken every care to be secret; and yet I never\nconsidered that I could conceal nothing from Him Who seeth all\nthings.  O my God, what evil is done in the world by disregarding\nthis, and thinking that anything can be kept secret that is done\nagainst Thee!  I am quite certain that great evils would be\navoided if we clearly understood that what we have to do is, not\nto be on our guard against men, but on our guard against\ndispleasing Thee.\n10. For the first eight days, I suffered much; but more from the\nsuspicion that my vanity was known, than from being in the\nmonastery; for I was already weary of myself--and, though I\noffended God, I never ceased to have a great fear of Him, and\ncontrived to go to confession as quickly as I could.  I was very\nuncomfortable; but within eight days, I think sooner, I was much\nmore contented than I had been in my father's house.  All the\nnuns were pleased with me; for our Lord had given me the grace to\nplease every one, wherever I might be.  I was therefore made much\nof in the monastery.  Though at this time I hated to be a nun,\nyet I was delighted at the sight of nuns so good; for they were\nvery good in that house--very prudent, observant of the rule,\nand recollected.\n11. Yet, for all this, the devil did not cease to tempt me; and\npeople in the world sought means to trouble my rest with messages\nand presents.  As this could not be allowed, it was soon over,\nand my soul began to return to the good habits of my earlier\nyears; and I recognized the great mercy of God to those whom He\nplaces among good people.  It seems as if His Majesty had sought\nand sought again how to convert me to Himself.  Blessed be Thou,\nO Lord, for having borne with me so long!  Amen.\n12. Were it not for my many faults, there was some excuse for me,\nI think, in this: that the conversation I shared in was with one\nwho, I thought, would do well in the estate of matrimony; [4] and\nI was told by my confessors, and others also, whom in many points\nI consulted, used to say, that I was not offending God.  One of\nthe nuns [5] slept with us who were seculars, and through her it\npleased our Lord to give me light, as I shall now explain.\n1. The Saint throughout her life was extremely careful of\ncleanliness.  In one of her letters to Father Jerome Gratian of\nthe Mother of God (No. 323, Letter 28, vol. iii. ed. Doblado),\nshe begs him, for the love of God, to see that the Fathers had\nclean cells and table; and the Ven. Mother Anne of\nSt. Bartholomew, in her life (Bruxelles, 1708, p. 40), says that\nshe changed the Saint's linen on the day of her death, and was\nthanked by her for her carefulness.  \"Her soul was so pure,\" says\nthe Ven. Mother, \"that she could not bear anything that was\nnot clean.\"\n2. Maria de Cepeda, half-sister of the Saint.  She was married to\nDon Martin de Guzman y Barrientos; and the contract for the dowry\nwas signed January 11, 1531 (Reforma de los Descal\u00e7os\nlib. i. ch. vii. \u00a7 4).\n3. The Augustinian Monastery of Our Lady of Grace.  It was\nfounded in 1509 by the venerable Fra Juan of Seville,\nVicar-General of the Order (Reforma de los Descal\u00e7os\nlib. i. ch. vii. n. 2).  There were forty nuns in the house at\nthis time (De la\u00a0Fuente).\n4. Some have said that the Saint at this time intended, or\nwished, to be married; and Father Bouix translates the passage\nthus: \"une alliance honorable pour moi.\"  But it is more probable\nthat the Saint had listened only to the story of her cousin's\nintended marriage; for in ch. v. \u00a7 11, she says that our Lord had\nalways kept her from seeking to be loved of men.\n5. Do\u00f1a Maria Brize\u00f1o, mistress of the secular children who were\neducated in the monastery (Reforma, lib. i. ch. vii. \u00a7 3).\nChapter III.\nThe Blessing of Being with Good People.  How Certain Illusions\nWere Removed.\n1. I began gradually to like the good and holy conversation of\nthis nun.  How well she used to speak of God! for she was a\nperson of great discretion and sanctity.  I listened to her with\ndelight.  I think there never was a time when I was not glad to\nlisten to her.  She began by telling me how she came to be a nun\nthrough the mere reading of the words of the Gospel \"Many are\ncalled, and few are chosen.\" [1]  She would speak of the reward\nwhich our Lord gives to those who forsake all things for His\nsake.  This good companionship began to root out the habits which\nbad companionship had formed, and to bring my thoughts back to\nthe desire of eternal things, as well as to banish in some\nmeasure the great dislike I had to be a nun, which had been very\ngreat; and if I saw any one weep in prayer, or devout in any\nother way, I envied her very much; for my heart was now so hard,\nthat I could not shed a tear, even if I read the Passion through.\nThis was a grief to me.\n2. I remained in the monastery a year and a half, and was very\nmuch the better for it.  I began to say many vocal prayers, and\nto ask all the nuns to pray for me, that God would place me in\nthat state wherein I was to serve Him; but, for all this, I\nwished not to be a nun, and that God would not be pleased I\nshould be one, though at the same time I was afraid of marriage.\nAt the end of my stay there, I had a greater inclination to be a\nnun, yet not in that house, on account of certain devotional\npractices which I understood prevailed there, and which I thought\noverstrained.  Some of the younger ones encouraged me in this my\nwish; and if all had been of one mind, I might have profited by\nit.  I had also a great friend [2] in another monastery; and this\nmade me resolve, if I was to be a nun, not to be one in any other\nhouse than where she was.  I looked more to the pleasure of sense\nand vanity than to the good of my soul.  These good thoughts of\nbeing a nun came to me from time to time.  They left me very\nsoon; and I could not persuade myself to become one.\n3. At this time, though I was not careless about my own good, our\nLord was much more careful to dispose me for that state of life\nwhich was best for me.  He sent me a serious illness, so that I\nwas obliged to return to my father's house.\n4. When I became well again, they took me to see my sister [3] in\nher house in the country village where she dwelt. Her love for me\nwas so great, that, if she had had her will, I should never have\nleft her.  Her husband also had a great affection for me--at\nleast, he showed me all kindness.  This too I owe rather to our\nLord, for I have received kindness everywhere; and all my service\nin return is, that I am what I am.\n5. On the road lived a brother of my father [4]--a prudent and\nmost excellent man, then a widower.  Him too our Lord was\npreparing for Himself.  In his old age, he left all his\npossessions and became a religious.  He so finished his course,\nthat I believe him to have the vision of God.  He would have me\nstay with him some days.  His practice was to read good books in\nSpanish; and his ordinary conversation was about God and the\nvanity of the world.  These books he made me read to him; and,\nthough I did not much like them, I appeared as if I did; for in\ngiving pleasure to others I have been most particular, though it\nmight be painful to myself--so much so, that what in others might\nhave been a virtue was in me a great fault, because I was often\nextremely indiscreet.  O my God, in how many ways did His Majesty\nprepare me for the state wherein it was His will I should serve\nHim!--how, against my own will, He constrained me to do violence\nto myself!  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.\n6. Though I remained here but a few days, yet, through the\nimpression made on my heart by the words of God both heard and\nread, and by the good conversation of my uncle, I came to\nunderstand the truth I had heard in my childhood, that all things\nare as nothing, the world vanity, and passing rapidly away.\nI also began to be afraid that, if I were then to die, I should\ngo down to hell.  Though I could not bend my will to be a nun, I\nsaw that the religious state was the best and the safest.\nAnd thus, by little and little, I resolved to force myself\ninto it.\n7. The struggle lasted three months.  I used to press this reason\nagainst myself: The trials and sufferings of living as a nun\ncannot be greater than those of purgatory, and I have well\ndeserved to be in hell.  It is not much to spend the rest of my\nlife as if I were in purgatory, and then go straight to\nHeaven--which was what I desired.  I was more influenced by\nservile fear, I think, than by love, to enter religion.\n8. The devil put before me that I could not endure the trials of\nthe religious life, because of my delicate nurture.  I defended\nmyself against him by alleging the trials which Christ endured,\nand that it was not much for me to suffer something for His sake;\nbesides, He would help me to bear it.  I must have thought so,\nbut I do not remember this consideration.  I endured many\ntemptations during these days.  I was subject to fainting-fits,\nattended with fever,--for my health was always weak.  I had\nbecome by this time fond of good books, and that gave me life.\nI read the Epistles of St. Jerome, which filled me with so much\ncourage, that I resolved to tell my father of my purpose,--which\nwas almost like taking the habit; for I was so jealous of my\nword, that I would never, for any consideration, recede from a\npromise when once my word had been given.\n9. My father's love for me was so great, that I could never\nobtain his consent; nor could the prayers of others, whom I\npersuaded to speak to him, be of any avail.  The utmost I could\nget from him was that I might do as I pleased after his death.\nI now began to be afraid of myself, and of my own weakness--for I\nmight go back.  So, considering that such waiting was not safe\nfor me, I obtained my end in another way, as I shall now relate.\n1. St. Matt. xx. 16: \"Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci vero\u00a0electi.\"\n2.

Her Many Infirmities.\n1. In those days, when I was thus resolved, I had persuaded one\nof my brothers, [1] by speaking to him of the vanity of the\nworld, to become a friar; and we agreed together to set out one\nday very early in the morning for the monastery where that friend\nof mine lived for whom I had so great an affection: [2] though I\nwould have gone to any other monastery, if I thought I should\nserve God better in it, or to any one my father liked, so strong\nwas my resolution now to become a nun--for I thought more of the\nsalvation of my soul now, and made no account whatever of mine\nown ease.  I remember perfectly well, and it is quite true, that\nthe pain I felt when I left my father's house was so great, that\nI do not believe the pain of dying will be greater--for it seemed\nto me as if every bone in my body were wrenched asunder; [3] for,\nas I had no love of God to destroy my love of father and of\nkindred, this latter love came upon me with a violence so great\nthat, if our Lord had not been my keeper, my own resolution to go\non would have failed me.  But He gave me courage to fight against\nmyself, so that I executed my purpose. [4]\n2. When I took the habit, [5] our Lord at once made me understand\nhow He helps those who do violence to themselves in order to\nserve Him.  No one observed this violence in me; they saw nothing\nbut the greatest good will.  At that moment, because I was\nentering on that state, I was filled with a joy so great, that it\nhas never failed me to this day; and God converted the aridity of\nmy soul into the greatest tenderness.  Everything in religion was\na delight unto me; and it is true that now and then I used to\nsweep the house during those hours of the day which I had\nformerly spent on my amusements and my dress; and, calling to\nmind that I was delivered from such follies, I was filled with a\nnew joy that surprised me, nor could I understand whence it came.\n3. Whenever I remember this, there is nothing in the world,\nhowever hard it may be, that, if it were proposed to me, I would\nnot undertake without any hesitation whatever; for I know now, by\nexperience in many things, that if from the first I resolutely\npersevere in my purpose, even in this life His Majesty rewards it\nin a way which he only understands who has tried it.  When the\nact is done for God only, it is His will before we begin it that\nthe soul, in order to the increase of its merits, should be\nafraid; and the greater the fear, if we do but succeed, the\ngreater the reward, and the sweetness thence afterwards\nresulting.  I know this by experience, as I have just said, in\nmany serious affairs; and so, if I were a person who had to\nadvise anybody, I would never counsel any one, to whom good\ninspirations from time to time may come, to resist them through\nfear of the difficulty of carrying them into effect; for if a\nperson lives detached for the love of God only, that is no reason\nfor being afraid of failure, for He is omnipotent.  May He be\nblessed for ever!  Amen.\n4. O supreme Good, and my Rest, those graces ought to have been\nenough which Thou hadst given me hitherto, seeing that Thy\ncompassion and greatness had drawn me through so many windings to\na state so secure, to a house where there are so many servants of\nGod, from whom I might learn how I may advance in Thy service.\nI know not how to go on, when I call to mind the circumstances of\nmy profession, the great resolution and joy with which I made it,\nand my betrothal unto Thee.  I cannot speak of it without tears;\nand my tears ought to be tears of blood, my heart ought to break,\nand that would not be much to suffer because of the many offences\nagainst Thee which I have committed since that day.  It seems to\nme now that I had good reasons for not wishing for this dignity,\nseeing that I have made so sad a use of it.  But Thou, O my Lord,\nhast been willing to bear with me for almost twenty years of my\nevil using of Thy graces, till I might become better.  It seems\nto me, O my God, that I did nothing but promise never to keep any\nof the promises then made to Thee.  Yet such was not my\nintention: but I see that what I have done since is of such a\nnature, that I know not what my intention was.  So it was and so\nit happened, that it may be the better known, O my Bridegroom,\nWho Thou art and what I am.\n5. It is certainly true that very frequently the joy I have in\nthat the multitude of Thy mercies is made known in me, softens\nthe bitter sense of my great faults.  In whom, O Lord, can they\nshine forth as they do in me, who by my evil deeds have shrouded\nin darkness Thy great graces, which Thou hadst begun to work in\nme?  Woe is me, O my Maker!  If I would make an excuse, I have\nnone to offer; and I only am to blame.  For if I could return to\nThee any portion of that love which Thou hadst begun to show unto\nme, I would give it only unto Thee, and then everything would\nhave been safe.  But, as I have not deserved this, nor been so\nhappy as to have done it, let Thy mercy, O Lord, rest upon me.\n6. The change in the habits of my life, and in my food, proved\nhurtful to my health; and though my happiness was great, that was\nnot enough.  The fainting-fits began to be more frequent; and my\nheart was so seriously affected, that every one who saw it was\nalarmed; and I had also many other ailments.  And thus it was I\nspent the first year, having very bad health, though I do not\nthink I offended God in it much.  And as my illness was so\nserious--I was almost insensible at all times, and frequently\nwholly so--my father took great pains to find some relief; and as\nthe physicians who attended me had none to give, he had me taken\nto a place which had a great reputation for the cure of other\ninfirmities.  They said I should find relief there. [6]\nThat friend of whom I have spoken as being in the house went with\nme. She was one of the elder nuns.  In the house where I was a\nnun, there was no vow of enclosure. [7]\n7. I remained there nearly a year, for three months of it\nsuffering most cruel tortures--effects of the violent remedies\nwhich they applied.  I know not how I endured them; and indeed,\nthough I submitted myself to them, they were, as I shall\nrelate, [8] more than my constitution could bear.\n8. I was to begin the treatment in the spring, and went thither\nwhen winter commenced.  The intervening time I spent with my\nsister, of whom I spoke before, [9] in her house in the country,\nwaiting for the month of April, which was drawing near, that I\nmight not have to go and return.  The uncle of whom I have made\nmention before, [10] and whose house was on our road, gave me a\nbook called Tercer Abecedario, [11] which treats of the prayer of\nrecollection.  Though in the first year I had read good\nbooks--for I would read no others, because I understood now the\nharm they had done me--I did not know how to make my prayer, nor\nhow to recollect myself.  I was therefore much pleased with the\nbook, and resolved to follow the way of prayer it described with\nall my might.  And as our Lord had already bestowed upon me the\ngift of tears, and I found pleasure in reading, I began to spend\na certain time in solitude, to go frequently to confession, and\nmake a beginning of that way of prayer, with this book for my\nguide; for I had no master--I mean, no confessor--who understood\nme, though I sought for such a one for twenty years afterwards:\nwhich did me much harm, in that I frequently went backwards, and\nmight have been even utterly lost; for, anyhow, a director would\nhave helped me to escape the risks I ran of sinning against God.\n9. From the very beginning, God was most gracious unto me.\nThough I was not so free from sin as the book required, I passed\nthat by; such watchfulness seemed to me almost impossible.  I was\non my guard against mortal sin--and would to God I had always\nbeen so!--but I was careless about venial sins, and that was my\nruin.  Yet, for all this, at the end of my stay there--I spent\nnearly nine months in the practice of solitude--our Lord began to\ncomfort me so much in this way of prayer, as in His mercy to\nraise me to the prayer of quiet, and now and then to that of\nunion, though I understood not what either the one or the other\nwas, nor the great esteem I ought to have had of them.  I believe\nit would have been a great blessing to me if I had understood the\nmatter.  It is true that the prayer of union lasted but a short\ntime: I know not if it continued for the space of an Ave Maria;\nbut the fruits of it remained; and they were such that, though I\nwas then not twenty years of age, I seemed to despise the world\nutterly; and so I remember how sorry I was for those who followed\nits ways, though only in things lawful.\n10. I used to labour with all my might to imagine Jesus Christ,\nour Good and our Lord, present within me.  And this was the way I\nprayed.  If I meditated on any mystery of His life, I represented\nit to myself as within me, though the greater part of my time I\nspent in reading good books, which was all my comfort; for God\nnever endowed me with the gift of making reflections with the\nunderstanding, or with that of using the imagination to any good\npurpose: my imagination is so sluggish, [12] that even if I would\nthink of, or picture to myself, as I used to labour to picture,\nour Lord's Humanity, I never could do it.\n11. And though men may attain more quickly to the state of\ncontemplation, if they persevere, by this way of inability to\nexert the intellect, yet is the process more laborious and\npainful; for if the will have nothing to occupy it, and if love\nhave no present object to rest on, the soul is without support\nand without employment--its isolation and dryness occasion great\npain, and the thoughts assail it most grievously.  Persons in\nthis condition must have greater purity of conscience than those\nwho can make use of their understanding; for he who can use his\nintellect in the way of meditation on what the world is, on what\nhe owes to God, on the great sufferings of God for him, his own\nscanty service in return, and on the reward God reserves for\nthose who love Him, learns how to defend himself against his own\nthoughts, and against the occasions and perils of sin.  On the\nother hand, he who has not that power is in greater danger, and\nought to occupy himself much in reading, seeing that he is not in\nthe slightest degree able to help himself.\n12. This way of proceeding is so exceedingly painful, that if the\nmaster who teaches it insists on cutting off the succours which\nreading gives, and requires the spending of much time in prayer,\nthen, I say, it will be impossible to persevere long in it: and\nif he persists in his plan, health will be ruined, because it is\na most painful process.  Reading is of great service towards\nprocuring recollection in any one who proceeds in this way; and\nit is even necessary for him, however little it may be that he\nreads, if only as a substitute for the mental prayer which is\nbeyond his reach.\n13. Now I seem to understand that it was the good providence of\nour Lord over me that found no one to teach me.  If I had, it\nwould have been impossible for me to persevere during the\neighteen years of my trial and of those great aridities because\nof my inability to meditate.  During all this time, it was only\nafter Communion that I ever ventured to begin my prayer without a\nbook--my soul was as much afraid to pray without one, as if it\nhad to fight against a host.  With a book to help me--it was like\na companion, and a shield whereon to receive the blows of many\nthoughts--I found comfort; for it was not usual with me to be in\naridity: but I always was so when I had no book; for my soul was\ndisturbed, and my thoughts wandered at once.  With one, I began\nto collect my thoughts, and, using it as a decoy, kept my soul in\npeace, very frequently by merely opening a book--there was no\nnecessity for more.  Sometimes, I read but little; at other\ntimes, much--according as our Lord had pity on me.\n14. It seemed to me, in these beginnings of which I am speaking,\nthat there could be no danger capable of withdrawing me from so\ngreat a blessing, if I had but books, and could have remained\nalone; and I believe that, by the grace of God, it would have\nbeen so, if I had had a master or any one to warn me against\nthose occasions of sin in the beginning, and, if I fell, to bring\nme quickly out of them.  If the devil had assailed me openly\nthen, I believe I should never have fallen into any grievous sin;\nbut he was so subtle, and I so weak, that all my good resolutions\nwere of little service--though, in those days in which I served\nGod, they were very profitable in enabling me, with that patience\nwhich His Majesty gave me, to endure the alarming illnesses which\nI had to bear.  I have often thought with wonder of the great\ngoodness of God; and my soul has rejoiced in the contemplation of\nHis great magnificence and mercy.  May He be blessed for\never!--for I see clearly that He has not omitted to reward me,\neven in this life, for every one of my good desires.  My good\nworks, however wretched and imperfect, have been made better and\nperfected by Him Who is my Lord: He has rendered them\nmeritorious.  As to my evil deeds and my sins, He hid them at\nonce.  The eyes of those who saw them, He made even blind; and He\nhas blotted them out of their memory.  He gilds my faults, makes\nvirtue to shine forth, giving it to me Himself, and compelling me\nto possess it, as it were, by force.\n15. I must now return to that which has been enjoined me.  I say,\nthat if I had to describe minutely how our Lord dealt with me in\nthe beginning, it would be necessary for me to have another\nunderstanding than that I have: so that I might be able to\nappreciate what I owe to Him, together with my own ingratitude\nand wickedness; for I have forgotten it all.\nMay He be blessed for ever Who has borne with me so long!  Amen.\n1. Antonio de Ahumada; who, according to the most probable\nopinion, entered the Dominican monastery of St. Thomas, Avila.\nIt is said that he died before he was professed.  Some said he\njoined the Hieronymites; but this is not so probable (De la\nFuente).  Ribera, however, says that he did enter the novitiate\nof the Hieronymites. but died before he was out of it\n(lib. i. ch. vi.).\n2. Juana Suarez, in the Monastery of the Incarnation, Avila.\n3. See Relation, vi. \u00a7 3.\n4. The nuns sent word to the father of his child's escape, and of\nher desire to become a nun, but without any expectation of\nobtaining his consent.  He came to the monastery forthwith, and\n\"offered up his Isaac on Mount Carmel\" (Reforma,\nlib. i. ch. viii. \u00a7 5).\n5. The Saint entered the Monastery of the Incarnation Nov. 2,\n1533, and made her profession Nov. 3, 1534 (Bollandists and\nBouix).  Ribera says she entered November 2, 1535; and the\nchronicler of the Order, relying on the contract by which her\nfather bound himself to the monastery, says that she took the\nhabit Nov. 2, 1536, and that Ribera had made a mistake.\n6. Her father took her from the monastery in the autumn of 1535,\naccording to the Bollandists, but of 1538, according to the\nchronicler, who adds, that she was taken to her uncle's\nhouse--Pedro Sanchez de Cepeda--in Hortigosa, and then to\nCastellanos de la Ca\u00f1ada, to the house of her sister, Do\u00f1a Maria,\nwhere she remained till the spring, when she went to Bezadas for\nher cure (Reforma, lib. i. ch. xi. \u00a7 2).\n7.

The Story of a Priest Whom\nShe Rescued from a Life of Sin.\n1. I forgot to say how, in the year of my novitiate, I suffered\nmuch uneasiness about things in themselves of no importance; but\nI was found fault with very often when I was blameless.  I bore\nit painfully and with imperfection; however, I went through it\nall, because of the joy I had in being a nun.  When they saw me\nseeking to be alone, and even weeping over my sins at times, they\nthought I was discontented, and said so.\n2. All religious observances had an attraction for me, but I\ncould not endure any which seemed to make me contemptible.\nI delighted in being thought well of by others, and was very\nexact in everything I had to do.  All this I thought was a\nvirtue, though it will not serve as any excuse for me, because I\nknew what it was to procure my own satisfaction in everything,\nand so ignorance does not blot out the blame.  There may be some\nexcuse in the fact that the monastery was not founded in great\nperfection.  I, wicked as I was, followed after that which I saw\nwas wrong, and neglected that which was good.\n3. There was then in the house a nun labouring under a most\ngrievous and painful disorder, for there were open ulcers in her\nbody, caused by certain obstructions, through which her food was\nrejected.  Of this sickness she soon died.  All the sisters, I\nsaw, were afraid of her malady.  I envied her patience very much;\nI prayed to God that He would give me a like patience; and then,\nwhatever sickness it might be His pleasure to send, I do not\nthink I was afraid of any, for I was resolved on gaining eternal\ngood, and determined to gain it by any and by every means.\n4. I am surprised at myself, because then I had not, as I\nbelieve, that love of God which I think I had after I began to\npray.  Then, I had only light to see that all things that pass\naway are to be lightly esteemed, and that the good things to be\ngained by despising them are of great price, because they are for\never.  His Majesty heard me also in this, for in less than two\nyears I was so afflicted myself that the illness which I had,\nthough of a different kind from that of the sister, was, I really\nbelieve, not less painful and trying for the three years it\nlasted, as I shall now relate.\n5. When the time had come for which I was waiting in the place I\nspoke of before [1]--I was in my sister's house, for the purpose\nof undergoing the medical treatment--they took me away with the\nutmost care of my comfort; that is, my father, my sister, and the\nnun, my friend, who had come from the monastery with me,--for her\nlove for me was very great.  At that moment, Satan began to\ntrouble my soul; God, however, brought forth a great blessing out\nof that trouble.\n6. In the place to which I had gone for my cure lived a priest of\ngood birth and understanding, with some learning, but not much.\nI went to confession to him, for I was always fond of learned\nmen, although confessors indifferently learned did my soul much\nharm; for I did not always find confessors whose learning was as\ngood as I could wish it was.  I know by experience that it is\nbetter, if the confessors are good men and of holy lives, that\nthey should have no learning at all, than a little; for such\nconfessors never trust themselves without consulting those who\nare learned--nor would I trust them myself: and a really learned\nconfessor never deceived me. [2]  Neither did the others\nwillingly deceive me, only they knew no better; I thought they\nwere learned, and that I was not under any other obligation than\nthat of believing them, as their instructions to me were lax, and\nleft me more at liberty--for if they had been strict with me, I\nam so wicked, I should have sought for others. That which was a\nvenial sin, they told me was no sin at all; of that which was\nmost grievously mortal, they said it was venial. [3]\n7. This did me so much harm, that it is no wonder I should speak\nof it here as a warning to others, that they may avoid an evil so\ngreat; for I see clearly that in the eyes of God I was without\nexcuse, that the things I did being in themselves not good, this\nshould have been enough to keep me from them.  I believe that\nGod, by reason of my sins, allowed those confessors to deceive\nthemselves and to deceive me.  I myself deceived many others by\nsaying to them what had been said to me.\n8. I continued in this blindness, I believe, more than seventeen\nyears, till a most learned Dominican Father [4] undeceived me in\npart, and those of the Company of Jesus made me altogether so\nafraid, by insisting on the erroneousness of these principles, as\nI shall hereafter show. [5]\n9. I began, then, by going to confession to that priest of whom I\nspoke before. [6]  He took an extreme liking to me, because I had\nthen but little to confess in comparison with what I had\nafterwards; and I had never much to say since I became a nun.\nThere was no harm in the liking he had for me, but it ceased to\nbe good, because it was in excess.  He clearly understood that I\nwas determined on no account whatever to do anything whereby God\nmight be seriously offended.  He, too, gave me a like assurance\nabout himself, and accordingly our conferences were many.  But at\nthat time, through the knowledge and fear of God which filled my\nsoul, what gave me most pleasure in all my conversations with\nothers was to speak of God; and, as I was so young, this made him\nashamed; and then, out of that great goodwill he bore me, he\nbegan to tell me of his wretched state.  It was very sad, for he\nhad been nearly seven years in a most perilous condition, because\nof his affection for, and conversation with, a woman of that\nplace; and yet he used to say Mass.  The matter was so public,\nthat his honour and good name were lost, and no one ventured to\nspeak to him about it.  I was extremely sorry for him, because I\nliked him much.  I was then so imprudent and so blind as to think\nit a virtue to be grateful and loyal to one who liked me.\nCursed be that loyalty which reaches so far as to go against the\nlaw of God.  It is a madness common in the world, and it makes me\nmad to see it.  We are indebted to God for all the good that men\ndo to us, and yet we hold it to be an act of virtue not to break\na friendship of this kind, though it lead us to go against Him.\nOh, blindness of the world!  Let me, O Lord, be most ungrateful\nto the world; never at all unto Thee.  But I have been altogether\notherwise through my sins.\n10. I procured further information about the matter from members\nof his household; I learned more of his ruinous state, and saw\nthat the poor man's fault was not so grave, because the miserable\nwoman had had recourse to enchantments, by giving him a little\nimage made of copper, which she had begged him to wear for love\nof her around his neck; and this no one had influence enough to\npersuade him to throw away.  As to this matter of enchantments, I\ndo not believe it to be altogether true; but I will relate what I\nsaw, by way of warning to men to be on their guard against women\nwho will do things of this kind.  And let them be assured of\nthis, that women--for they are more bound to purity than men--if\nonce they have lost all shame before God, are in nothing whatever\nto be trusted; and that in exchange for the gratification of\ntheir will, and of that affection which the devil suggests, they\nwill hesitate at nothing.\n11. Though I have been so wicked myself, I never fell into\nanything of this kind, nor did I ever attempt to do evil; nor, if\nI had the power, would I have ever constrained any one to like\nme, for our Lord kept me from this.  But if He had abandoned me,\nI should have done wrong in this, as I did in other things--for\nthere is nothing in me whereon anyone may rely.\n12. When I knew this, I began to show him greater affection: my\nintention was good, but the act was wrong, for I ought not to do\nthe least wrong for the sake of any good, how great soever it may\nbe.  I spoke to him most frequently of God; and this must have\ndone him good--though I believe that what touched him most was\nhis great affection for me, because, to do me a pleasure, he gave\nme that little image of copper, and I had it at once thrown into\na river.  When he had given it up, like a man roused from deep\nsleep, he began to consider all that he had done in those years;\nand then, amazed at himself, lamenting his ruinous state, that\nwoman came to be hateful in his eyes.  Our Lady must have helped\nhim greatly, for he had a very great devotion to her Conception,\nand used to keep the feast thereof with great solemnity.\nIn short, he broke off all relations with that woman utterly, and\nwas never weary of giving God thanks for the light He had given\nhim; and at the end of the year from the day I first saw him,\nhe died.\n13. He had been most diligent in the service of God; and as for\nthat great affection he had for me, I never observed anything\nwrong in it, though it might have been of greater purity.\nThere were also occasions wherein he might have most grievously\noffended, if he had not kept himself in the near presence of God.\nAs I said before, [7] I would not then have done anything I knew\nwas a mortal sin.  And I think that observing this resolution in\nme helped him to have that affection for me; for I believe that\nall men must have a greater affection for those women whom they\nsee disposed to be good; and even for the attainment of earthly\nends, women must have more power over men because they are good,\nas I shall show hereafter.  I am convinced that the priest is in\nthe way of salvation.  He died most piously, and completely\nwithdrawn from that occasion of sin.  It seems that it was the\nwill of our Lord he should be saved by these means.\n14. I remained three months in that place, in the most grievous\nsufferings; for the treatment was too severe for my constitution.\nIn two months--so strong were the medicines--my life was nearly\nworn out; and the severity of the pain in the heart, [8] for the\ncure of which I was there was much more keen: it seemed to me,\nnow and then, as if it had been seized by sharp teeth.  So great\nwas the torment, that it was feared it might end in madness.\nThere was a great loss of strength, for I could eat nothing\nwhatever, only drink.  I had a great loathing for food, and a\nfever that never left me.  I was so reduced, for they had given\nme purgatives daily for nearly a month, and so parched up, that\nmy sinews began to shrink.  The pains I had were unendurable, and\nI was overwhelmed in a most deep sadness, so that I had no rest\neither night or day.\n15. This was the result; and thereupon my father took me back.\nThen the physicians visited me again.  All gave me up; they said\nI was also consumptive.  This gave me little or no concern; what\ndistressed me were the pains I had--for I was in pain from my\nhead down to my feet.  Now, nervous pains, according to the\nphysicians, are intolerable; and all my nerves were shrunk.\nCertainly, if I had not brought this upon myself by my sins, the\ntorture would have been unendurable.\n16. I was not more than three months in this cruel distress, for\nit seemed impossible that so many ills could be borne together.\nI now am astonished at myself, and the patience His Majesty gave\nme--for it clearly came from Him--I look upon as a great mercy of\nour Lord.  It was a great help to me to be patient, that I had\nread the story of Job, in the Morals of St. Gregory (our Lord\nseems to have prepared me thereby); and that I had begun the\npractice of prayer, so that I might bear it all, conforming my\nwill to the will of God.  All my conversation was with God.\nI had continually these words of Job in my thoughts and in my\nmouth: \"If we have received good things of the hand of our Lord,\nwhy should we not receive evil things?\" [9]  This seemed to give\nme courage.\n17. The feast of our Lady, in August, came round; from April\nuntil then I had been in great pain, but more especially during\nthe last three months.  I made haste to go to confession, for I\nhad always been very fond of frequent confession.  They thought I\nwas driven by the fear of death; and so my father, in order to\nquiet me, would not suffer me to go.  Oh, the unreasonable love\nof flesh and blood!  Though it was that of a father so Catholic\nand so wise--he was very much so, and this act of his could not\nbe the effect of any ignorance on his part--what evil it might\nhave done me!\n18. That very night my sickness became so acute, that for about\nfour days I remained insensible.  They administered the Sacrament\nof the last Anointing, and every hour, or rather every moment,\nthought I was dying; they did nothing but repeat the Credo, as if\nI could have understood anything they said.  They must have\nregarded me as dead more than once, for I found afterwards drops\nof wax on my eyelids.  My father, because he had not allowed me\nto go to confession, was grievously distressed.  Loud cries and\nmany prayers were made to God: blessed be He Who heard them.\n19. For a day-and-a-half the grave was open in my monastery,\nwaiting for my body; [10] and the Friars of our Order, in a house\nat some distance from this place, performed funeral solemnities.\nBut it pleased our Lord I should come to myself.  I wished to go\nto confession at once.  I communicated with many tears; but I do\nnot think those tears had their source in that pain and sorrow\nonly for having offended God, which might have sufficed for my\nsalvation--unless, indeed, the delusion which I laboured under\nwere some excuse for me, and into which I had been led by those\nwho had told me that some things were not mortal sins which\nafterwards I found were so certainly.\n20. Though my sufferings were unendurable, and my perceptions\ndull, yet my confession, I believe, was complete as to all\nmatters wherein I understood myself to have offended God. This\ngrace, among others, did His Majesty bestow on me, that ever\nsince my first Communion never in confession have I failed to\nconfess anything I thought to be a sin, though it might be only a\nvenial sin.  But I think that undoubtedly my salvation was in\ngreat peril, if I had died at that time--partly because my\nconfessors were so unlearned, and partly because I was so very\nwicked.  It is certainly true that when I think of it, and\nconsider how our Lord seems to have raised me up from the dead, I\nam so filled with wonder, that I almost tremble with fear. [11]\n21. And now, O my soul, it were well for thee to look that danger\nin the face from which our Lord delivered thee; and if thou dost\nnot cease to offend Him out of love thou shouldst do so out of\nfear.  He might have slain thee a thousand times, and in a far\nmore perilous state.  I believe I exaggerate nothing if I say a\nthousand times again, though he may rebuke me who has commanded\nme to restrain myself in recounting my sins; and they are glossed\nover enough. I pray him, for the love of God, not to suppress one\nof my faults, because herein shines forth the magnificence of\nGod, as well as His long-suffering towards souls.  May He be\nblessed for evermore, and destroy me utterly, rather than let me\ncease to love Him any more!\n1. Ch. iv. \u00a7 6.

After those four days, during which I was insensible, so great\nwas my distress, that our Lord alone knoweth the intolerable\nsufferings I endured.  My tongue was bitten to pieces; there was\na choking in my throat because I had taken nothing, and because\nof my weakness, so that I could not swallow even a drop of water;\nall my bones seemed to be out of joint, and the disorder of my\nhead was extreme.  I was bent together like a coil of ropes--for\nto this was I brought by the torture of those days--unable to\nmove either arm, or foot, or hand, or head, any more than if I\nhad been dead, unless others moved me; I could move, however, I\nthink, one finger of my right hand.  Then, as to touching me,\nthat was impossible, for I was so bruised that I could not endure\nit.  They used to move me in a sheet, one holding one end, and\nanother the other.  This lasted till Palm Sunday. [1]\n2. The only comfort I had was this--if no one came near me, my\npains frequently ceased; and then, because I had a little rest, I\nconsidered myself well, for I was afraid my patience would fail:\nand thus I was exceedingly happy when I saw myself free from\nthose pains which were so sharp and constant, though in the cold\nfits of an intermittent fever, which were most violent, they were\nstill unendurable.  My dislike of food was very great.\n3. I was now so anxious to return to my monastery, that I had\nmyself conveyed thither in the state I was in.  There they\nreceived alive one whom they had waited for as dead; but her body\nwas worse than dead: the sight of it could only give pain.  It is\nimpossible to describe my extreme weakness, for I was nothing but\nbones.  I remained in this state, as I have already said, [2]\nmore than eight months; and was paralytic, though getting better,\nfor about three years.  I praised God when I began to crawl on my\nhands and knees.  I bore all this with great resignation, and, if\nI except the beginning of my illness, with great joy; for all\nthis was as nothing in comparison with the pains and tortures I\nhad to bear at first.  I was resigned to the will of God, even if\nHe left me in this state for ever.  My anxiety about the recovery\nof my health seemed to be grounded on my desire to pray in\nsolitude, as I had been taught; for there were no means of doing\nso in the infirmary.  I went to confession most frequently, spoke\nmuch about God, and in such a way as to edify everyone; and they\nall marvelled at the patience which our Lord gave me--for if it\nhad not come from the hand of His Majesty, it seemed impossible\nto endure so great an affliction with so great a joy.\n4. It was a great thing for me to have had the grace of prayer\nwhich God had wrought in me; it made me understand what it is to\nlove Him.  In a little while, I saw these virtues renewed within\nme; still they were not strong, for they were not sufficient to\nsustain me in justice.  I never spoke ill in the slightest degree\nwhatever of any one, and my ordinary practice was to avoid all\ndetraction; for I used to keep most carefully in mind that I\nought not to assent to, nor say of another, anything I should not\nlike to have said of myself.  I was extremely careful to keep\nthis resolution on all occasions though not so perfectly, upon\nsome great occasions that presented themselves, as not to break\nit sometimes.  But my ordinary practice was this: and thus those\nwho were about me, and those with whom I conversed, became so\nconvinced that it was right, that they adopted it as a habit.\nIt came to be understood that where I was, absent persons were\nsafe; so they were also with my friends and kindred, and with\nthose whom I instructed.  Still, for all this, I have a strict\naccount to give unto God for the bad example I gave in other\nrespects. May it please His Majesty to forgive me, for I have\nbeen the cause of much evil; though not with intentions as\nperverse as were the acts that followed.\n5. The longing for solitude remained, and I loved to discourse\nand speak of God; for if I found any one with whom I could do so,\nit was a greater joy and satisfaction to me than all the\nrefinements--or rather to speak more correctly, the real\nrudeness--of the world's conversation.  I communicated and\nconfessed more frequently still, and desired to do so; I was\nextremely fond of reading good books; I was most deeply penitent\nfor having offended God; and I remember that very often I did not\ndare to pray, because I was afraid of that most bitter anguish\nwhich I felt for having offended God, dreading it as a great\nchastisement.  This grew upon me afterwards to so great a degree,\nthat I know of no torment wherewith to compare it; and yet it was\nneither more nor less because of any fear I had at any time, for\nit came upon me only when I remembered the consolations of our\nLord which He gave me in prayer, the great debt I owed Him, the\nevil return I made: I could not bear it.  I was also extremely\nangry with myself on account of the many tears I shed for my\nfaults, when I saw how little I improved, seeing that neither my\ngood resolutions, nor the pains I took, were sufficient to keep\nme from falling whenever I had the opportunity.  I looked on my\ntears as a delusion; and my faults, therefore, I regarded as the\nmore grievous, because I saw the great goodness of our Lord to me\nin the shedding of those tears, and together with them such\ndeep compunction.\n6. I took care to go to confession as soon as I could; and, as I\nthink, did all that was possible on my part to return to a state\nof grace.  But the whole evil lay in my not thoroughly avoiding\nthe occasions of sin, and in my confessors, who helped me so\nlittle.  If they had told me that I was travelling on a dangerous\nroad, and that I was bound to abstain from those conversations, I\nbelieve, without any doubt, that the matter would have been\nremedied, because I could not bear to remain even for one day in\nmortal sin, if I knew it.\n7. All these tokens of the fear of God came to me through prayer;\nand the greatest of them was this, that fear was swallowed up of\nlove--for I never thought of chastisement.  All the time I was so\nill, my strict watch over my conscience reached to all that is\nmortal sin.\n8. O my God! I wished for health, that I might serve Thee better;\nthat was the cause of all my ruin.  For when I saw how helpless I\nwas through paralysis, being still so young, and how the\nphysicians of this world had dealt with me, I determined to ask\nthose of heaven to heal me--for I wished, nevertheless, to be\nwell, though I bore my illness with great joy.  Sometimes, too, I\nused to think that if I recovered my health, and yet were lost\nfor ever, I was better as I was.  But, for all that, I thought I\nmight serve God much better if I were well.  This is our\ndelusion; we do not resign ourselves absolutely to the\ndisposition of our Lord, Who knows best what is for our good.\n9. I began by having Masses and prayers said for my\nintention--prayers that were highly sanctioned; for I never liked\nthose other devotions which some people, especially women, make\nuse of with a ceremoniousness to me intolerable, but which move\nthem to be devout.  I have been given to understand since that\nthey were unseemly and superstitious; and I took for my patron\nand lord the glorious St. Joseph, and recommended myself\nearnestly to him.  I saw clearly that both out of this my present\ntrouble, and out of others of greater importance, relating to my\nhonour and the loss of my soul, this my father and lord delivered\nme, and rendered me greater services than I knew how to ask for.\nI cannot call to mind that I have ever asked him at any time for\nanything which he has not granted; and I am filled with amazement\nwhen I consider the great favours which God hath given me through\nthis blessed Saint; the dangers from which he hath delivered me,\nboth of body and of soul.  To other Saints, our Lord seems to\nhave given grace to succour men in some special necessity; but to\nthis glorious Saint, I know by experience, to help us in all: and\nour Lord would have us understand that as He was Himself subject\nto him upon earth--for St. Joseph having the title of father, and\nbeing His guardian, could command Him--so now in heaven He\nperforms all his petitions.  I have asked others to recommend\nthemselves to St. Joseph, and they too know this by experience;\nand there are many who are now of late devout to him, [3] having\nhad experience of this truth.\n10. I used to keep his feast with all the solemnity I could, but\nwith more vanity than spirituality, seeking rather too much\nsplendour and effect, and yet with good intentions.  I had this\nevil in me, that if our Lord gave me grace to do any good, that\ngood became full of imperfections and of many faults; but as for\ndoing wrong, the indulgence of curiosity and vanity, I was very\nskilful and active therein.  Our Lord forgive me!\n11. Would that I could persuade all men to be devout to this\nglorious Saint; for I know by long experience what blessings he\ncan obtain for us from God.  I have never known any one who was\nreally devout to him, and who honoured him by particular\nservices, who did not visibly grow more and more in virtue; for\nhe helps in a special way those souls who commend themselves to\nhim.  It is now some years since I have always on his feast asked\nhim for something, and I always have it.  If the petition be in\nany way amiss, he directs it aright for my greater good.\n12. If I were a person who had authority to write, it would be a\npleasure to me to be diffusive in speaking most minutely of the\ngraces which this glorious Saint has obtained for me and for\nothers.  But that I may not go beyond the commandment that is\nlaid upon me, I must in many things be more brief than I could\nwish, and more diffusive than is necessary in others; for, in\nshort, I am a person who, in all that is good, has but little\ndiscretion.  But I ask, for the love of God, that he who does not\nbelieve me will make the trial for himself--when he will see by\nexperience the great good that results from commending oneself to\nthis glorious patriarch, and being devout to him.  Those who give\nthemselves to prayer should in a special manner have always a\ndevotion to St. Joseph; for I know not how any man can think of\nthe Queen of the angels, during the time that she suffered so\nmuch with the Infant Jesus, without giving thanks to St. Joseph\nfor the services he rendered them then.  He who cannot find any\none to teach him how to pray, let him take this glorious Saint\nfor his master, and he will not wander out of the way.\n13. May it please our Lord that I have not done amiss in\nventuring to speak about St. Joseph; for, though I publicly\nprofess my devotion to him, I have always failed in my service to\nhim and imitation of him.  He was like himself when he made me\nable to rise and walk, no longer a paralytic; and I, too, am like\nmyself when I make so bad a use of this grace.\n14. Who could have said that I was so soon to fall, after such\ngreat consolations from God--after His Majesty had implanted\nvirtues in me which of themselves made me serve Him--after I had\nbeen, as it were, dead, and in such extreme peril of eternal\ndamnation--after He had raised me up, soul and body, so that all\nwho saw me marvelled to see me alive?  What can it mean, O my\nLord?  The life we live is so full of danger!  While I am writing\nthis--and it seems to me, too, by Thy grace and mercy--I may say\nwith St. Paul, though not so truly as he did: \"It is not I who\nlive now, but Thou, my Creator, livest in me.\" [4]  For some\nyears past, so it seems to me, Thou hast held me by the hand; and\nI see in myself desires and resolutions--in some measure tested\nby experience, in many ways, during that time--never to do\nanything, however slight it may be, contrary to Thy will, though\nI must have frequently offended Thy Divine Majesty without being\naware of it; and I also think that nothing can be proposed to me\nthat I should not with great resolution undertake for Thy love.\nIn some things Thou hast Thyself helped me to succeed therein.\nI love neither the world, nor the things of the world; nor do I\nbelieve that anything that does not come from Thee can give me\npleasure; everything else seems to me a heavy cross.\n15. Still, I may easily deceive myself, and it may be that I am\nnot what I say I am; but Thou knowest, O my Lord, that, to the\nbest of my knowledge, I lie not.  I am afraid, and with good\nreason, lest Thou shouldst abandon me; for I know now how far my\nstrength and little virtue can reach, if Thou be not ever at hand\nto supply them, and to help me never to forsake Thee.  May His\nMajesty grant that I be not forsaken of Thee even now, when I am\nthinking all this of myself!\n16. I know not how we can wish to live, seeing that everything is\nso uncertain.  Once, O Lord, I thought it impossible to forsake\nThee so utterly; and now that I have forsaken Thee so often, I\ncannot help being afraid; for when Thou didst withdraw but a\nlittle from me, I fell down to the ground at once.  Blessed for\never be Thou!  Though I have forsaken Thee, Thou hast not\nforsaken me so utterly but that Thou hast come again and raised\nme up, giving me Thy hand always.  Very often, O Lord, I would\nnot take it: very often I would not listen when Thou wert calling\nme again, as I am going to show.\n1. March 25, 1537.\n2. Ch. v. \u00a7 17.  The Saint left her monastery in 1535; and in the\nspring of 1536 went from her sister's house to Bezadas; and in\nJuly of that year was brought back to her father's house in\nAvila, wherein she remained till Palm Sunday, 1537, when she\nreturned to the Monastery of the Incarnation.  She had been\nseized with paralysis there, and laboured under it nearly three\nyears, from 1536 to 1539, when she was miraculously healed\nthrough the intercession of St. Joseph (Bolland, n. 100, 101).\nThe dates of the Chronicler are different from these.\n3. Of the devotion to St. Joseph, F. Faber (The Blessed\nSacrament, bk. ii. p. 199, 3rd ed.) says that it took its rise in\nthe West, in a confraternity in Avignon.  \"Then it spread over\nthe church. Gerson was raised up to be its doctor and theologian,\nand St. Teresa to be its Saint, and St. Francis of Sales to be\nits popular teacher and missionary.  The houses of Carmel were\nlike the holy house of Nazareth to it; and the colleges of the\nJesuits, its peaceful sojourns in dark Egypt.\"\n4. Galat. ii. 20: \"Vivo autem, jam non ego; vivit vero in\nme\u00a0Christus.\"\nChapter VII.\nLukewarmness.  The Loss of Grace.  Inconvenience of Laxity in\nReligious Houses.\n1. So, then, going on from pastime to pastime, from vanity to\nvanity, from one occasion of sin to another, I began to expose\nmyself exceedingly to the very greatest dangers: my soul was so\ndistracted by many vanities, that I was ashamed to draw near unto\nGod in an act of such special friendship as that of prayer. [1]\nAs my sins multiplied, I began to lose the pleasure and comfort I\nhad in virtuous things: and that loss contributed to the\nabandonment of prayer.  I see now most clearly, O my Lord, that\nthis comfort departed from me because I had departed from Thee.\n2. It was the most fearful delusion into which Satan could plunge\nme--to give up prayer under the pretence of humility.  I began to\nbe afraid of giving myself to prayer, because I saw myself so\nlost.  I thought it would be better for me, seeing that in my\nwickedness I was one of the most wicked, to live like the\nmultitude--to say the prayers which I was bound to say, and that\nvocally: not to practise mental prayer nor commune with God so\nmuch; for I deserved to be with the devils, and was deceiving\nthose who were about me, because I made an outward show of\ngoodness; and therefore the community in which I dwelt is not to\nbe blamed; for with my cunning I so managed matters, that all had\na good opinion of me; and yet I did not seek this deliberately by\nsimulating devotion; for in all that relates to hypocrisy and\nostentation--glory be to God!--I do not remember that I ever\noffended Him, [2] so far as I know.  The very first movements\nherein gave me such pain, that the devil would depart from me\nwith loss, and the gain remained with me; and thus, accordingly,\nhe never tempted me much in this way.  Perhaps, however, if God\nhad permitted Satan to tempt me as sharply herein as he tempted\nme in other things, I should have fallen also into this; but His\nMajesty has preserved me until now.  May He be blessed for\nevermore!  It was rather a heavy affliction to me that I should\nbe thought so well of; for I knew my own secret.\n3. The reason why they thought I was not so wicked was this: they\nsaw that I, who was so young, and exposed to so many occasions of\nsin, withdrew myself so often into solitude for prayer, read\nmuch, spoke of God, that I liked to have His image painted in\nmany places, to have an oratory of my own, and furnish it with\nobjects of devotion, that I spoke ill of no one, and other things\nof the same kind in me which have the appearance of virtue.  Yet\nall the while--I was so vain--I knew how to procure respect for\nmyself by doing those things which in the world are usually\nregarded with respect.\n4. In consequence of this, they gave me as much liberty as they\ndid to the oldest nuns, and even more, and had great confidence\nin me; for as to taking any liberty for myself, or doing anything\nwithout leave--such as conversing through the door, or in secret,\nor by night--I do not think I could have brought myself to speak\nwith anybody in the monastery in that way, and I never did it;\nfor our Lord held me back.  It seemed to me--for I considered\nmany things carefully and of set purpose--that it would be a very\nevil deed on my part, wicked as I was, to risk the credit of so\nmany nuns, who were all good--as if everything else I did was\nwell done!  In truth, the evil I did was not the result of\ndeliberation, as this would have been, if I had done it, although\nit was too much so.\n5. Therefore, I think that it did me much harm to be in a\nmonastery not enclosed.  The liberty which those who were good\nmight have with advantage--they not being obliged to do more than\nthey do, because they had not bound themselves to\nenclosure--would certainly have led me, who am wicked, straight\nto hell, if our Lord, by so many remedies and means of His most\nsingular mercy, had not delivered me out of that danger--and it\nis, I believe, the very greatest danger--namely, a monastery of\nwomen unenclosed--yea, more, I think it is, for those who will be\nwicked, a road to hell, rather than a help to their weakness.\nThis is not to be understood of my monastery; for there are so\nmany there who in the utmost sincerity, and in great perfection,\nserve our Lord, so that His Majesty, according to His goodness,\ncannot but be gracious unto them; neither is it one of those\nwhich are most open for all religious observances are kept in it;\nand I am speaking only of others which I have seen and known.\n6. I am exceedingly sorry for these houses, because our Lord must\nof necessity send His special inspirations not merely once, but\nmany times, if the nuns therein are to be saved, seeing that the\nhonours and amusements of the world are allowed among them, and\nthe obligations of their state are so ill-understood.  God grant\nthey may not count that to be virtue which is sin, as I did so\noften!  It is very difficult to make people understand this; it\nis necessary our Lord Himself should take the matter seriously\ninto His own hands.\n7. If parents would take my advice, now that they are at no pains\nto place their daughters where they may walk in the way of\nsalvation without incurring a greater risk than they would do if\nthey were left in the world, let them look at least at that which\nconcerns their good name.  Let them marry them to persons of a\nmuch lower degree, rather than place them in monasteries of this\nkind, unless they be of extremely good inclinations, and God\ngrant that these inclinations may come to good! or let them keep\nthem at home.  If they will be wicked at home, their evil life\ncan be hidden only for a short time; but in monasteries it can be\nhidden long, and, in the end, it is our Lord that discovers it.\nThey injure not only themselves, but all the nuns also.  And all\nthe while the poor things are not in fault; for they walk in the\nway that is shown them.  Many of them are to be pitied; for they\nwished to withdraw from the world, and, thinking to escape from\nthe dangers of it, and that they were going to serve our Lord,\nhave found themselves in ten worlds at once, without knowing what\nto do, or how to help themselves.  Youth and sensuality and the\ndevil invite them and incline them to follow certain ways which\nare of the essence of worldliness.  They see these ways, so to\nspeak, considered as safe there.\n8. Now, these seem to me to be in some degree like those wretched\nheretics who will make themselves blind, and who will consider\nthat which they do to be good, and so believe, but without really\nbelieving; for they have within themselves something that tells\nthem it is wrong.\n9. Oh, what utter ruin! utter ruin of religious persons--I am not\nspeaking now more of women than of men--where the rules of the\nOrder are not kept; where the same monastery offers two roads:\none of virtue and observance, the other of inobservance, and both\nequally frequented!  I have spoken incorrectly: they are not\nequally frequented; for, on account of our sins, the way of the\ngreatest imperfection is the most frequented; and because it is\nthe broadest, it is also the most in favour.  The way of\nreligious observance is so little used, that the friar and the\nnun who would really begin to follow their vocation thoroughly\nhave reason to fear the members of their communities more than\nall the devils together.  They must be more cautious, and\ndissemble more, when they would speak of that friendship with God\nwhich they desire to have, than when they would speak of those\nfriendships and affections which the devil arranges in\nmonasteries.  I know not why we are astonished that the Church is\nin so much trouble, when we see those, who ought to be an example\nof every virtue to others, so disfigure the work which the spirit\nof the Saints departed wrought in their Orders.  May it please\nHis Divine Majesty to apply a remedy to this, as He sees it to be\nneedful!  Amen.\n10. So, then, when I began to indulge in these conversations, I\ndid not think, seeing they were customary, that my soul must be\ninjured and dissipated, as I afterwards found it must be, by such\nconversations.  I thought that, as receiving visits was so common\nin many monasteries, no more harm would befall me thereby than\nbefell others, whom I knew to be good.  I did not observe that\nthey were much better than I was, and that an act which was\nperilous for me was not so perilous for them; and yet I have no\ndoubt there was some danger in it, were it nothing else but a\nwaste of time.\n11. I was once with a person--it was at the very beginning of my\nacquaintance with her when our Lord was pleased to show me that\nthese friendships were not good for me: to warn me also, and in\nmy blindness, which was so great, to give me light.  Christ stood\nbefore me, stern and grave, giving me to understand what in my\nconduct was offensive to Him.  I saw Him with the eyes of the\nsoul more distinctly than I could have seen Him with the eyes of\nthe body.  The vision made so deep an impression upon me, that,\nthough it is more than twenty-six years ago, [3] I seem to see\nHim present even now.  I was greatly astonished and disturbed,\nand I resolved not to see that person again.\n12. It did me much harm that I did not then know it was possible\nto see anything otherwise than with the eyes of the body; [4] so\ndid Satan too, in that he helped me to think so: he made me\nunderstand it to be impossible, and suggested that I had imagined\nthe vision--that it might be Satan himself--and other\nsuppositions of that kind.  For all this, the impression remained\nwith me that the vision was from God, and not an imagination;\nbut, as it was not to my liking, I forced myself to lie to\nmyself; and as I did not dare to discuss the matter with any one,\nand as great importunity was used, I went back to my former\nconversation with the same person, and with others also, at\ndifferent times; for I was assured that there was no harm in\nseeing such a person, and that I gained, instead of losing,\nreputation by doing so.  I spent many years in this pestilent\namusement; for it never appeared to me, when I was engaged in it,\nto be so bad as it really was, though at times I saw clearly it\nwas not good.  But no one caused me the same distraction which\nthat person did of whom I am speaking; and that was because I had\na great affection for her.\n13. At another time, when I was with that person, we saw, both of\nus, and others who were present also saw, something like a great\ntoad crawling towards us, more rapidly than such a creature is in\nthe habit of crawling.  I cannot understand how a reptile of that\nkind could, in the middle of the day, have come forth from that\nplace; it never had done so before, [5] but the impression it\nmade on me was such, that I think it must have had a meaning;\nneither have I ever forgotten it.  Oh, the greatness of God! with\nwhat care and tenderness didst Thou warn me in every way! and how\nlittle I profited by those warnings!\n14. There was in that house a nun, who was related to me, now\ngrown old, a great servant of God, and a strict observer of the\nrule.  She too warned me from time to time; but I not only did\nnot listen to her, but was even offended, thinking she was\nscandalized without cause.  I have mentioned this in order that\nmy wickedness and the great goodness of God might be understood,\nand to show how much I deserved hell for ingratitude so great,\nand, moreover, if it should be our Lord's will and pleasure that\nany nun at any time should read this, that she might take warning\nby me.  I beseech them all, for the love of our Lord, to flee\nfrom such recreations as these.\n15. May His Majesty grant I may undeceive some one of the many I\nled astray when I told them there was no harm in these things,\nand assured them there was no such great danger therein. I did so\nbecause I was blind myself; for I would not deliberately lead\nthem astray.  By the bad example I set before them--I spoke of\nthis before [6]--I was the occasion of much evil, not thinking I\nwas doing so much harm.\n16. In those early days, when I was ill, and before I knew how to\nbe of use to myself, I had a very strong desire to further the\nprogress of others: [7] a most common temptation of beginners.\nWith me, however, it had good results.  Loving my father so much,\nI longed to see him in the possession of that good which I seemed\nto derive myself from prayer.  I thought that in this life there\ncould not be a greater good than prayer; and by roundabout ways,\nas well as I could, I contrived make him enter upon it; I gave\nhim books for that end.  As he was so good--I said so\nbefore [8]--this exercise took such a hold upon him, that in five\nor six years, I think it was, he made so great a progress that I\nused to praise our Lord for it.  It was a very great consolation\nto me. He had most grievous trials of diverse kinds; and he bore\nthem all with the greatest resignation.  He came often to see me;\nfor it was a comfort to him to speak of the things of God.\n17. And now that I had become so dissipated, and had ceased to\npray, and yet saw that he still thought I was what I used to be,\nI could not endure it, and so undeceived him.  I had been a year\nand more without praying, thinking it an act of greater humility\nto abstain.  This--I shall speak of it again [9]--was the\ngreatest temptation I ever had, because it very nearly wrought my\nutter ruin; [10] for, when I used to pray, if I offended God one\nday, on the following days I would recollect myself, and withdraw\nfarther from the occasions of sin.\n18. When that blessed man, having that good opinion of me, came\nto visit me, it pained me to see him so deceived as to think that\nI used to pray to God as before.  So I told him that I did not\npray; but I did not tell him why.  I put my infirmities forward\nas an excuse; for though I had recovered from that which was so\ntroublesome, I have always been weak, even very much so; and\nthough my infirmities are somewhat less troublesome now than they\nwere, they still afflict me in many ways; specially, I have been\nsuffering for twenty years from sickness every morning, [11] so\nthat I could not take any food till past mid-day, and even\noccasionally not till later; and now, since my Communions have\nbecome more frequent, it is at night, before I lie down to rest,\nthat the sickness occurs, and with greater pain; for I have to\nbring it on with a feather, or other means.  If I do not bring it\non, I suffer more; and thus I am never, I believe, free from\ngreat pain, which is sometimes very acute, especially about the\nheart; though the fainting-fits are now but of rare occurrence.\nI am also, these eight years past, free from the paralysis, and\nfrom other infirmities of fever, which I had so often.  These\nafflictions I now regard so lightly, that I am even glad of them,\nbelieving that our Lord in some degree takes His pleasure\nin them.\n19. My father believed me when I gave him that for a reason, as\nhe never told a lie himself; neither should I have done so,\nconsidering the relation we were in.  I told him, in order to be\nthe more easily believed, that it was much for me to be able to\nattend in choir, though I saw clearly that this was no excuse\nwhatever; neither, however, was it a sufficient reason for giving\nup a practice which does not require, of necessity, bodily\nstrength, but only love and a habit thereof; yet our Lord always\nfurnishes an opportunity for it, if we but seek it.  I say\nalways; for though there may be times, as in illness, and from\nother causes, when we cannot be much alone, yet it never can be\nbut there must be opportunities when our strength is sufficient\nfor the purpose; and in sickness itself, and amidst other\nhindrances, true prayer consists, when the soul loves, in\noffering up its burden, and in thinking of Him for Whom it\nsuffers, and in the resignation of the will, and in a thousand\nways which then present themselves.  It is under these\ncircumstances that love exerts itself for it is not necessarily\nprayer when we are alone; and neither is it not prayer when we\nare not.\n20. With a little care, we may find great blessings on those\noccasions when our Lord, by means of afflictions, deprives us of\ntime for prayer; and so I found it when I had a good conscience.\nBut my father, having that opinion of me which he had, and\nbecause of the love he bore me, believed all I told him;\nmoreover, he was sorry for me; and as he had now risen to great\nheights of prayer himself, he never remained with me long; for\nwhen he had seen me, he went his way, saying that he was wasting\nhis time.  As I was wasting it in other vanities, I cared little\nabout this.\n21. My father was not the only person whom I prevailed upon to\npractise prayer, though I was walking in vanity myself.  When I\nsaw persons fond of reciting their prayers, I showed them how to\nmake a meditation, and helped them and gave them books; for from\nthe time I began myself to pray, as I said before, [12] I always\nhad a desire that others should serve God.  I thought, now that I\ndid not myself serve our Lord according to the light I had, that\nthe knowledge His Majesty had given me ought not to be lost, and\nthat others should serve Him for me. [13]  I say this in order to\nexplain the great blindness I was in: going to ruin myself, and\nlabouring to save others.\n22. At this time, that illness befell my father of which he\ndied; [14] it lasted some days.  I went to nurse him, being more\nsick in spirit than he was in body, owing to my many\nvanities--though not, so far as I know, to the extent of being in\nmortal sin--through the whole of that wretched time of which I am\nspeaking; for, if I knew myself to be in mortal sin, I would not\nhave continued in it on any account.  I suffered much myself\nduring his illness.  I believe I rendered him some service in\nreturn for what he had suffered in mine.  Though I was very ill,\nI did violence to myself; and though in losing him I was to lose\nall the comfort and good of my life--he was all this to me--I was\nso courageous, that I never betrayed my sorrows, concealing them\ntill he was dead, as if I felt none at all.  It seemed as if my\nvery soul were wrenched when I saw him at the point of death--my\nlove for him was so deep.\n23. It was a matter for which we ought to praise our Lord--the\ndeath that he died, and the desire he had to die; so also was the\nadvice he gave us after the last anointing, how he charged us to\nrecommend him to God, and to pray for mercy for him, how he bade\nus serve God always, and consider how all things come to an end.\nHe told us with tears how sorry he was that he had not served Him\nhimself; for he wished he was a friar--I mean, that he had been\none in the Strictest Order that is.  I have a most assured\nconviction that our Lord, some fifteen days before, had revealed\nto him he was not to live; for up to that time, though very ill,\nhe did not think so; but now, though he was somewhat better, and\nthe physicians said so, he gave no heed to them, but employed\nhimself in the ordering of his soul.\n24. His chief suffering consisted in a most acute pain of the\nshoulders, which never left him: it was so sharp at times, that\nit put him into great torture.  I said to him, that as he had so\ngreat a devotion to our Lord carrying His cross on His shoulders,\nhe should now think that His Majesty wished him to feel somewhat\nof that pain which He then suffered Himself. This so comforted\nhim, that I do not think I heard him complain afterwards.\n25. He remained three days without consciousness; but on the day\nhe died, our Lord restored him so completely, that we were\nastonished: he preserved his understanding to the last; for in\nthe middle of the creed, which he repeated himself, he died.\nHe lay there like an angel--such he seemed to me, if I may say\nso, both in soul and disposition: he was very good.\n26. I know not why I have said this, unless it be for the purpose\nof showing how much the more I am to be blamed for my wickedness;\nfor after seeing such a death, and knowing what his life had\nbeen, I, in order to be in any wise like unto such a father,\nought to have grown better.  His confessor, a most learned\nDominican, [15] used to say that he had no doubt he went straight\nto heaven. [16]  He had heard his confession for some years, and\nspoke with praise of the purity of his conscience.\n27. This Dominican father, who was a very good man, fearing God,\ndid me a very great service; for I confessed to him.  He took\nupon himself the task of helping my soul in earnest, and of\nmaking me see the perilous state I was in. [17]  He sent me to\nCommunion once a fortnight; [18] and I, by degrees beginning to\nspeak to him, told him about my prayer.  He charged me never to\nomit it: that, anyhow, it could not do me anything but good.\nI began to return to it--though I did not cut off the occasions\nof sin--and never afterwards gave it up.  My life became most\nwretched, because I learned in prayer more and more of my faults.\nOn one side, God was calling me; on the other, I was following\nthe world.  All the things of God gave me great pleasure; and I\nwas a prisoner to the things of the world.  It seemed as if I\nwished to reconcile two contradictions, so much at variance one\nwith another as are the life of the spirit and the joys and\npleasures and amusements of sense. [19]\n28. I suffered much in prayer; for the spirit was slave, and not\nmaster; and so I was not able to shut myself up within\nmyself--that was my whole method of prayer--without shutting up\nwith me a thousand vanities at the same time.  I spent many years\nin this way; and I am now astonished that any one could have\nborne it without abandoning either the one or the other.  I know\nwell that it was not in my power then to give up prayer, because\nHe held me in His hand Who sought me that He might show me\ngreater mercies.\n29. O my God! if I might, I would speak of the occasions from\nwhich God delivered me, and how I threw myself into them again;\nand of the risks I ran of losing utterly my good name, from which\nHe delivered me.  I did things to show what I was; and our Lord\nhid the evil, and revealed some little virtue--if so be I had\nany--and made it great in the eyes of all, so that they always\nheld me in much honour.  For although my follies came\noccasionally into light, people would not believe it when they\nsaw other things, which they thought good.  The reason is, that\nHe Who knoweth all things saw it was necessary it should be so,\nin order that I might have some credit given me by those to whom\nin after years I was to speak of His service.  His supreme\nmunificence regarded not my great sins, but rather the desires I\nfrequently had to please Him, and the pain I felt because I had\nnot the strength to bring those desires to good effect.\n30. O Lord of my soul! how shall I be able to magnify the graces\nwhich Thou, in those years, didst bestow upon me?  Oh, how, at\nthe very time that I offended Thee most, Thou didst prepare me in\na moment, by a most profound compunction, to taste of the\nsweetness of Thy consolations and mercies!  In truth, O my King,\nThou didst administer to me the most delicate and painful\nchastisement it was possible for me to bear; for Thou knewest\nwell what would have given me the most pain.  Thou didst chastise\nmy sins with great consolations.  I do not believe I am saying\nfoolish things, though it may well be that I am beside myself\nwhenever I call to mind my ingratitude and my wickedness.\n31. It was more painful for me, in the state I was in, to receive\ngraces, when I had fallen into grievous faults, than it would\nhave been to receive chastisement; for one of those faults, I am\nsure, used to bring me low, shame and distress me, more than many\ndiseases, together with many heavy trials, could have done.\nFor, as to the latter, I saw that I deserved them; and it seemed\nto me that by them I was making some reparation for my sins,\nthough it was but slight, for my sins are so many.  But when I\nsee myself receive graces anew, after being so ungrateful for\nthose already received, that is to me--and, I believe, to all who\nhave any knowledge or love of God--a fearful kind of torment.  We\nmay see how true this is by considering what a virtuous mind must\nbe. Hence my tears and vexation when I reflected on what I felt,\nseeing myself in a condition to fall at every moment, though my\nresolutions and desires then--I am speaking of that\ntime--were strong.\n32. It is a great evil for a soul to be alone in the midst of\nsuch great dangers; it seems to me that if I had had any one with\nwhom I could have spoken of all this, it might have helped me not\nto fall.  I might, at least, have been ashamed before him--and\nyet I was not ashamed before God.\n33. For this reason, I would advise those who give themselves to\nprayer, particularly at first, to form friendships; and converse\nfamiliarly, with others who are doing the same thing.  It is a\nmatter of the last importance, even if it lead only to helping\none another by prayer: how much more, seeing that it has led to\nmuch greater gain!  Now, if in their intercourse one with\nanother, and in the indulgence of human affections even not of\nthe best kind, men seek friends with whom they may refresh\nthemselves, and for the purpose of having greater satisfaction in\nspeaking of their empty joys, I know no reason why it should not\nbe lawful for him who is beginning to love and serve God in\nearnest to confide to another his joys and sorrows; for they who\nare given to prayer are thoroughly accustomed to both.\n34. For if that friendship with God which he desires be real, let\nhim not be afraid of vain-glory; and if the first movements\nthereof assail him, he will escape from it with merit; and I\nbelieve that he who will discuss the matter with this intention\nwill profit both himself and those who hear him, and thus will\nderive more light for his own understanding, as well as for the\ninstruction of his friends.  He who in discussing his method of\nprayer falls into vain-glory will do so also when he hears Mass\ndevoutly, if he is seen of men, and in doing other good works,\nwhich must be done under pain of being no Christian; and yet\nthese things must not be omitted through fear of vain-glory.\n35. Moreover, it is a most important matter for those souls who\nare not strong in virtue; for they have so many people, enemies\nas well as friends, to urge them the wrong way, that I do not see\nhow this point is capable of exaggeration.  It seems to me that\nSatan has employed this artifice--and it is of the greatest\nservice to him--namely, that men who really wish to love and\nplease God should hide the fact, while others, at his suggestion,\nmake open show of their malicious dispositions; and this is so\ncommon, that it seems a matter of boasting now, and the offences\ncommitted against God are thus published abroad.\n36. I do not know whether the things I am saying are foolish or\nnot.  If they be so, your reverence will strike them out.\nI entreat you to help my simplicity by adding a good deal to\nthis, because the things that relate to the service of God are so\nfeebly managed, that it is necessary for those who would serve\nHim to join shoulder to shoulder, if they are to advance at all;\nfor it is considered safe to live amidst the vanities and\npleasures of the world, and few there be who regard them with\nunfavourable eyes.  But if any one begins to give himself up to\nthe service of God, there are so many to find fault with him,\nthat it becomes necessary for him to seek companions, in order\nthat he may find protection among them till he grows strong\nenough not to feel what he may be made to suffer.  If he does\nnot, he will find himself in great straits.\n37. This, I believe, must have been the reason why some of the\nSaints withdrew into the desert.  And it is a kind of humility in\nman not to trust to himself, but to believe that God will help\nhim in his relations with those with whom he converses; and\ncharity grows by being diffused; and there are a thousand\nblessings herein which I would not dare to speak of, if I had not\nknown by experience the great importance of it.  It is very true\nthat I am the most wicked and the basest of all who are born of\nwomen; but I believe that he who, humbling himself, though\nstrong, yet trusteth not in himself, and believeth another who in\nthis matter has had experience, will lose nothing.  Of myself I\nmay say that, if our Lord had not revealed to me this truth, and\ngiven me the opportunity of speaking very frequently to persons\ngiven to prayer, I should have gone on falling and rising till I\ntumbled into hell.  I had many friends to help me to fall; but as\nto rising again, I was so much left to myself, that I wonder now\nI was not always on the ground.  I praise God for His mercy; for\nit was He only Who stretched out His hand to me.  May He be\nblessed for ever!  Amen.\n1. See Way of Perfection, ch. xl.; but ch. xxvii. of the\nformer editions.\n2.

The Great Advantage of Prayer,\nEven to Those Who May Have Ceased from It.\n1. It is not without reason that I have dwelt so long on this\nportion of my life.  I see clearly that it will give no one\npleasure to see anything so base; and certainly I wish those who\nmay read this to have me in abhorrence, as a soul so obstinate\nand so ungrateful to Him Who did so much for me.  I could wish,\ntoo, I had permission to say how often at this time I failed in\nmy duty to God, because I was not leaning on the strong pillar of\nprayer.  I passed nearly twenty years on this stormy sea, falling\nand rising, but rising to no good purpose, seeing that I went and\nfell again.  My life was one of perfection; but it was so mean,\nthat I scarcely made any account whatever of venial sins; and\nthough of mortal sins I was afraid, I was not so afraid of them\nas I ought to have been, because I did not avoid the perilous\noccasions of them.  I may say that it was the most painful life\nthat can be imagined, because I had no sweetness in God, and no\npleasure in the world.\n2. When I was in the midst of the pleasures of the world, the\nremembrance of what I owed to God made me sad; and when I was\npraying to God, my worldly affections disturbed me.  This is so\npainful a struggle, that I know not how I could have borne it for\na month, let alone for so many years.  Nevertheless, I can trace\ndistinctly the great mercy of our Lord to me, while thus immersed\nin the world, in that I had still the courage to pray.  I say\ncourage, because I know of nothing in the whole world which\nrequires greater courage than plotting treason against the King,\nknowing that He knows it, and yet never withdrawing from His\npresence; for, granting that we are always in the presence of\nGod, yet it seems to me that those who pray arc in His presence\nin a very different sense; for they, as it were, see that He is\nlooking upon them; while others may be for days together without\neven once recollecting that God sees them.\n3. It is true, indeed, that during these years there were many\nmonths, and, I believe, occasionally a whole year, in which I so\nkept guard over myself that I did not offend our Lord, gave\nmyself much to prayer, and took some pains, and that\nsuccessfully, not to offend Him.  I speak of this now, because\nall I am saying is strictly true; but I remember very little of\nthose good days, and so they must have been few, while my evil\ndays were many.  Still, the days that passed over without my\nspending a great part of them in prayer were few, unless I was\nvery ill, or very much occupied.\n4. When I was ill, I was well with God.  I contrived that those\nabout me should be so, too, and I made supplications to our Lord\nfor this grace, and spoke frequently of Him.  Thus, with the\nexception of that year of which I have been speaking, during\neight-and-twenty years of prayer, I spent more than eighteen in\nthat strife and contention which arose out of my attempts to\nreconcile God and the world.  As to the other years, of which I\nhave now to speak, in them the grounds of the warfare, though it\nwas not slight, were changed; but inasmuch as I was--at least, I\nthink so--serving God, and aware of the vanity of the world, all\nhas been pleasant, as I shall show hereafter. [1]\n5. The reason, then, of my telling this at so great a length is\nthat, as I have just said, [2] the mercy of God and my\ningratitude, on the one hand, may become known; and, on the\nother, that men may understand how great is the good which God\nworks in a soul when He gives it a disposition to pray in\nearnest, though it may not be so well prepared as it ought to be.\nIf that soul perseveres in spite of sins, temptations, and\nrelapses, brought about in a thousand ways by Satan, our Lord\nwill bring it at last--I am certain of it--to the harbour of\nsalvation, as He has brought me myself; for so it seems to me\nnow.  May His Majesty grant I may never go back and be lost!\nHe who gives himself to prayer is in possession of a great\nblessing, of which many saintly and good men have written--I am\nspeaking of mental prayer--glory be to God for it; and, if they\nhad not done so, I am not proud enough, though I have but little\nhumility, to presume to discuss it.\n6. I may speak of that which I know by experience; and so I say,\nlet him never cease from prayer who has once begun it, be his\nlife ever so wicked; for prayer is the way to amend it, and\nwithout prayer such amendment will be much more difficult.\nLet him not be tempted by Satan, as I was, to give it up, on the\npretence of humility; [3] let him rather believe that His words\nare true Who says that, if we truly repent, and resolve never to\noffend Him, He will take us into His favour again, [4] give us\nthe graces He gave us before, and occasionally even greater, if\nour repentance deserve it.  And as to him who has not begun to\npray, I implore him by the love of our Lord not to deprive\nhimself of so great a good.\n7. Herein there is nothing to be afraid of, but everything to\nhope for.  Granting that such a one does not advance, nor make an\neffort to become perfect, so as to merit the joys and\nconsolations which the perfect receive from God, yet he will by\nlittle and little attain to a knowledge of the road which leads\nto heaven.  And if he perseveres, I hope in the mercy of God for\nhim, seeing that no one ever took Him for his friend that was not\namply rewarded; for mental prayer is nothing else, in my opinion,\nbut being on terms of friendship with God, frequently conversing\nin secret with Him Who, we know, loves us.  Now, true love and\nlasting friendship require certain dispositions: those of our\nLord, we know, are absolutely perfect; ours, vicious, sensual,\nand thankless; and you cannot therefore, bring yourselves to love\nHim as He loves you, because you have not the disposition to do\nso; and if you do not love Him, yet, seeing how much it concerns\nyou to have His friendship, and how great is His love for you,\nrise above that pain you feel at being much with Him Who is so\ndifferent from you.\n8. O infinite goodness of my God!  I seem to see Thee and myself\nin this relation to one another.  O Joy of the angels! when I\nconsider it, I wish I could wholly die of love!  How true it is\nthat Thou endurest those who will not endure Thee!  Oh, how good\na friend art Thou, O my Lord! how Thou comfortest and endurest,\nand also waitest for them to make themselves like unto Thee, and\nyet, in the meanwhile, art Thyself so patient of the state they\nare in!  Thou takest into account the occasions during which they\nseek Thee, and for a moment of penitence forgettest their\noffences against Thyself.\n9. I have seen this distinctly in my own case, and I cannot tell\nwhy the whole world does not labour to draw near to Thee in this\nparticular friendship.  The wicked, who do not resemble Thee,\nought to do so, in order that Thou mayest make them good, and for\nthat purpose should permit Thee to remain with them at least for\ntwo hours daily, even though they may not remain with Thee but,\nas I used to do, with a thousand distractions, and with worldly\nthoughts.  In return for this violence which they offer to\nthemselves for the purpose of remaining in a company so good as\nThine--for at first they can do no more, and even afterwards at\ntimes--Thou, O Lord, defendest them against the assaults of evil\nspirits, whose power Thou restrainest, and even lessenest daily,\ngiving to them the victory over these their enemies.  So it is, O\nLife of all lives, Thou slayest none that put their trust in\nThee, and seek Thy friendship; yea, rather, Thou sustainest their\nbodily life in greater vigour, and makest their soul to live.\n10. I do not understand what there can be to make them afraid who\nare afraid to begin mental prayer, nor do I know what it is they\ndread.  The devil does well to bring this fear upon us, that he\nmay really hurt us by putting me in fear, he can make me cease\nfrom thinking of my offences against God, of the great debt I owe\nHim, of the existence of heaven and hell, and of the great\nsorrows and trials He underwent for me.  That was all my prayer,\nand had been, when I was in this dangerous state, and it was on\nthose subjects I dwelt whenever I could; and very often, for some\nyears, I was more occupied with the wish to see the end of the\ntime I had appointed for myself to spend in prayer, and in\nwatching the hour-glass, than with other thoughts that were good.\nIf a sharp penance had been laid upon me, I know of none that I\nwould not very often have willingly undertaken, rather than\nprepare myself for prayer by self-recollection.  And certainly\nthe violence with which Satan assailed me was so irresistible, or\nmy evil habits were so strong, that I did not betake myself to\nprayer; and the sadness I felt on entering the oratory was so\ngreat, that it required all the courage I had to force myself in.\nThey say of me that my courage is not slight, and it is known\nthat God has given me a courage beyond that of a woman; but I\nhave made a bad use of it.  In the end, our Lord came to my help;\nand then, when I had done this violence to myself, I found\ngreater peace and joy than I sometimes had when I had a desire\nto pray.\n11. If, then, our Lord bore so long with me, who was so\nwicked--and it is plain that it was by prayer all my evil was\ncorrected--why should any one, how wicked soever he may be, have\nany fear? Let him be ever so wicked, he will not remain in his\nwickedness so many years as I did, after receiving so many graces\nfrom our Lord.  Is there any one who can despair, when He bore so\nlong with me, only because I desired and contrived to find some\nplace and some opportunities for Him to be alone with me--and\nthat very often against my will? for I did violence to myself, or\nrather our Lord Himself did violence to me.\n12. If, then, to those who do not serve God, but rather offend\nHim, prayer be all this, and so necessary, and if no one can\nreally find out any harm it can do him, and if the omission of it\nbe not a still greater harm, why, then, should they abstain from\nit who serve and desire to serve God?  Certainly I cannot\ncomprehend it, unless it be that men have a mind to go through\nthe troubles of this life in greater misery, and to shut the door\nin the face of God, so that He shall give them no comfort in it.\nI am most truly sorry for them, because they serve God at their\nown cost; for of those who pray, God Himself defrays the charges,\nseeing that for a little trouble He gives sweetness, in order\nthat, by the help it supplies, they may bear their trials.\n13. But because I have much to say hereafter of this sweetness,\nwhich our Lord gives to those who persevere in prayer, [5] I do\nnot speak of it here; only this will I say: prayer is the door to\nthose great graces which our Lord bestowed upon me.  If this door\nbe shut, I do not see how He can bestow them; for even if He\nentered into a soul to take His delight therein, and to make that\nsoul also delight in Him, there is no way by which He can do so;\nfor His will is, that such a soul should be lonely and pure, with\na great desire to receive His graces.  If we put many hindrances\nin the way, and take no pains whatever to remove them, how can He\ncome to us, and how can we have any desire that He should show us\nHis great mercies?\n14. I will speak now--for it is very important to understand\nit--of the assaults which Satan directs against a soul for the\npurpose of taking it, and of the contrivances and compassion\nwherewith our Lord labours to convert it to Himself, in order\nthat men may behold His mercy, and the great good it was for me\nthat I did not give up prayer and spiritual reading, and that\nthey may be on their guard against the dangers against which I\nwas not on my guard myself.  And, above all, I implore them for\nthe love of our Lord, and for the great love with which He goeth\nabout seeking our conversion to Himself, to beware of the\noccasions of sin; for once placed therein, we have no ground to\nrest on--so many enemies then assail us, and our own weakness is\nsuch, that we cannot defend ourselves.\n15. Oh, that I knew how to describe the captivity of my soul in\nthose days!  I understood perfectly that I was in captivity, but\nI could not understand the nature of it; neither could I entirely\nbelieve that those things which my confessors did not make so\nmuch of were so wrong as I in my soul felt them to be. One of\nthem--I had gone to him with a scruple--told me that, even if I\nwere raised to high contemplation, those occasions and\nconversations were not unfitting for me.  This was towards the\nend, when, by the grace of God, I was withdrawing more and more\nfrom those great dangers, but not wholly from the occasions\nof them.\n16. When they saw my good desires, and how I occupied myself in\nprayer, I seemed to them to have done much; but my soul knew that\nthis was not doing what I was bound to do for Him to Whom I owed\nso much.  I am sorry for my poor soul even now, because of its\ngreat sufferings, and the little help it had from any one except\nGod, and for the wide door that man opened for it, that it might\ngo forth to its pastimes and pleasures, when they said that these\nthings were lawful.\n17. Then there was the torture of sermons, and that not a slight\none; for I was very fond of them.  If I heard any one preach well\nand with unction, I felt, without my seeking it, a particular\naffection for him, neither do I know whence it came.  Thus, no\nsermon ever seemed to me so bad, but that I listened to it with\npleasure; though, according to others who heard it, the preaching\nwas not good.  If it was a good sermon, it was to me a most\nspecial refreshment.  To speak of God, or to hear Him spoken of,\nnever wearied me.  I am speaking of the time after I gave myself\nto prayer.  At one time I had great comfort in sermons, at\nanother they distressed me, because they made me feel that I was\nvery far from being what I ought to have been.\n18. I used to pray to our Lord for help; but, as it now seems to\nme, I must have committed the fault of not putting my whole trust\nin His Majesty, and of not thoroughly distrusting myself.\nI sought for help, took great pains; but it must be that I did\nnot understand how all is of little profit if we do not root out\nall confidence in ourselves, and place it wholly in God. I wished\nto live, but I saw clearly that I was not living, but rather\nwrestling with the shadow of death; there was no one to give me\nlife, and I was not able to take it.  He Who could have given it\nme had good reasons for not coming to my aid, seeing that He had\nbrought me back to Himself so many times, and I as often had\nleft Him.\n1.

See ch. x. \u00a7 2, and ch. xi. \u00a7 22.\nChapter IX.\nThe Means Whereby Our Lord Quickened Her Soul, Gave Her Light in\nHer Darkness, and Made Her Strong in Goodness.\n1. My soul was now grown weary; and the miserable habits it had\ncontracted would not suffer it to rest, though it was desirous of\ndoing so.  It came to pass one day, when I went into the oratory,\nthat I saw a picture which they had put by there, and which had\nbeen procured for a certain feast observed in the house.  It was\na representation of Christ most grievously wounded; and so\ndevotional, that the very sight of it, when I saw it, moved\nme--so well did it show forth that which He suffered for us.\nSo keenly did I feel the evil return I had made for those wounds,\nthat I thought my heart was breaking.  I threw myself on the\nground beside it, my tears flowing plenteously, and implored Him\nto strengthen me once for all, so that I might never offend Him\nany more.\n2. I had a very great devotion to the glorious Magdalene, and\nvery frequently used to think of her conversion--especially when\nI went to Communion.  As I knew for certain that our Lord was\nthen within me, I used to place myself at His feet, thinking that\nmy tears would not be despised.  I did not know what I was\nsaying; only He did great things for me, in that He was pleased I\nshould shed those tears, seeing that I so soon forgot that\nimpression.  I used to recommend myself to that glorious Saint,\nthat she might obtain my pardon.\n3. But this last time, before that picture of which I am\nspeaking, I seem to have made greater progress; for I was now\nvery distrustful of myself, placing all my confidence in God.\nIt seems to me that I said to Him then that I would not rise up\ntill He granted my petition.  I do certainly believe that this\nwas of great service to me, because I have grown better\never since. [1]\n4. This was my method of prayer: as I could not make reflections\nwith my understanding, I contrived to picture Christ as within\nme; [2] and I used to find myself the better for thinking of\nthose mysteries of His life during which He was most lonely.\nIt seemed to me that the being alone and afflicted, like a person\nin trouble, must needs permit me to come near unto Him.\n5. I did many simple things of this kind; and in particular I\nused to find myself most at home in the prayer in the Garden,\nwhither I went in His company.  I thought of the bloody sweat,\nand of the affliction He endured there; I wished, if it had been\npossible, to wipe away that painful sweat from His face; but I\nremember that I never dared to form such a resolution--my sins\nstood before me so grievously.  I used to remain with Him there\nas long as my thoughts allowed me, and I had many thoughts to\ntorment me.  For many years, nearly every night before I fell\nasleep, when I recommended myself to God, that I might sleep in\npeace, I used always to think a little of this mystery of the\nprayer in the Garden--yea, even before I was a nun, because I had\nbeen told that many indulgences were to be gained thereby.\nFor my part, I believe that my soul gained very much in this way,\nbecause I began to practise prayer without knowing what it was;\nand now that it had become my constant habit, I was saved from\nomitting it, as I was from omitting to bless myself with the sign\nof the cross before I slept.\n6. And now to go back to what I was saying of the torture which\nmy thoughts inflicted upon me.  This method of praying, in which\nthe understanding makes no reflections, hath this property: the\nsoul must gain much, or lose.  I mean, that those who advance\nwithout meditation, make great progress, because it is done by\nlove.  But to attain to this involves great labour, except to\nthose persons whom it is our Lord's good pleasure to lead quickly\nto the prayer of quiet.  I know of some.  For those who walk in\nthis way, a book is profitable, that by the help thereof they may\nthe more quickly recollect themselves.  It was a help to me also\nto look on fields, water, and flowers. [3] In them I saw traces\nof the Creator--I mean, that the sight of these things was as a\nbook unto me; it roused me, made me recollected, and reminded me\nof my ingratitude and of my sins.  My understanding was so dull,\nthat I could never represent in the imagination either heavenly\nor high things in any form whatever until our Lord placed them\nbefore me in another way. [4]\n7. I was so little able to put things before me by the help of my\nunderstanding, that, unless I saw a thing with my eyes, my\nimagination was of no use whatever.  I could not do as others do,\nwho can put matters before themselves so as to become thereby\nrecollected.  I was able to think of Christ only as man.  But so\nit was; and I never could form any image of Him to myself, though\nI read much of His beauty, and looked at pictures of Him.  I was\nlike one who is blind, or in the dark, who, though speaking to a\nperson present, and feeling his presence, because he knows for\ncertain that he is present--I mean, that he understands him to be\npresent, and believes it--yet does not see him.  It was thus with\nme when I used to think of our Lord.  This is why I was so fond\nof images.  Wretched are they who, through their own fault, have\nlost this blessing; it is clear enough that they do not love our\nLord--for if they loved Him, they would rejoice at the sight of\nHis picture, just as men find pleasure when they see the portrait\nof one they love.\n8. At this time, the Confessions of St. Augustine were given me.\nOur Lord seems to have so ordained it, for I did not seek them\nmyself, neither had I ever seen them before.  I had a very great\ndevotion to St. Augustine, because the monastery in which I lived\nwhen I was yet in the world was of his Order; [5] and also\nbecause he had been a sinner--for I used to find great comfort in\nthose Saints whom, after they had sinned, our Lord converted to\nHimself.  I thought they would help me, and that, as our Lord had\nforgiven them, so also He would forgive me.  One thing, however,\nthere was that troubled me--I have spoken of it before [6]--our\nLord had called them but once, and they never relapsed; while my\nrelapses were now so many.  This it was that vexed me.\nBut calling to mind the love that He bore me, I took courage\nagain. Of His mercy I never doubted once, but I did very often\nof myself.\n9. O my God, I amazed at the hardness of my heart amidst so many\nsuccours from Thee.  I am filled with dread when I see how little\nI could do with myself, and how I was clogged, so that I could\nnot resolve to give myself entirely to God.  When I began to read\nthe Confessions, I thought I saw myself there described, and\nbegan to recommend myself greatly to this glorious Saint. When I\ncame to his conversion, and read how he heard that voice in the\ngarden, it seemed to me nothing less than that our Lord had\nuttered it for me: I felt so in my heart.  I remained for some\ntime lost in tears, in great inward affliction and distress. O my\nGod, what a soul has to suffer because it has lost the liberty it\nhad of being mistress over itself! and what torments it has to\nendure!  I wonder now how I could live in torments so great: God\nbe praised Who gave me life, so that I might escape from so fatal\na death!  I believe that my soul obtained great strength from His\nDivine Majesty, and that He must have heard my cry, and had\ncompassion upon so many tears.\n10. A desire to spend more time with Him began to grow within me,\nand also to withdraw from the occasions of sin: for as soon as I\nhad done so, I turned lovingly to His Majesty at once.\nI understood clearly, as I thought, that I loved Him; but I did\nnot understand, as I ought to have understood it, wherein the\ntrue love of God consists.  I do not think I had yet perfectly\ndisposed myself to seek His service when His Majesty turned\ntowards me with His consolations.  What others strive after with\ngreat labour, our Lord seems to have looked out for a way to make\nme willing to accept--that is, in these later years to give me\njoy and comfort.  But as for asking our Lord to give me either\nthese things or sweetness in devotion, I never dared to do it;\nthe only thing I prayed Him to give me was the grace never to\noffend Him, together with the forgiveness of my great sins.\nWhen I saw that my sins were so great, I never ventured\ndeliberately to ask for consolation or for sweetness.  He had\ncompassion enough upon me, I think--and, in truth, He dealt with\nme according to His great mercy--when He allowed me to stand\nbefore Him, and when He drew me into His presence; for I saw\nthat, if He had not drawn me, I should not have come at all.\n11. Once only in my life do I remember asking for consolation,\nbeing at the time in great aridities.  When I considered what I\nhad done, I was so confounded, that the very distress I suffered\nfrom seeing how little humility I had, brought me that which I\nhad been so bold as to ask for.  I knew well that it was lawful\nto pray for it; but it seemed to me that it is lawful only for\nthose who are in good dispositions, who have sought with all\ntheir might to attain to true devotion--that is, not to offend\nGod, and to be disposed and resolved for all goodness.  I looked\nupon those tears of mine as womanish and weak, seeing that I did\nnot obtain my desires by them; nevertheless, I believe that they\ndid me some service; for, specially after those two occasions of\ngreat compunction and sorrow of heart, [7] accompanied by tears,\nof which I am speaking, I began in an especial way to give myself\nmore to prayer, and to occupy myself less with those things which\ndid me harm--though I did not give them up altogether.  But God\nHimself, as I have just said, came to my aid, and helped me to\nturn away from them.  As His Majesty was only waiting for some\npreparation on my part, the spiritual graces grew in me as I\nshall now explain.  It is not the custom of our Lord to give\nthese graces to any but to those who keep their consciences in\ngreater pureness. [8]\n1. In the year 1555 (Bouix).\n2.

She Desires Her Confessors to Keep Her Writings Secret,\nBecause of the Special Graces of Our Lord to Her, Which They Had\nCommanded Her to Describe.\n1. I used to have at times, as I have said, [1] though it used to\npass quickly away--certain commencements of that which I am going\nnow to describe.  When I formed those pictures within myself of\nthrowing myself at the feet of Christ, as I said before, [2] and\nsometimes even when I was reading, a feeling of the presence of\nGod would come over me unexpectedly, so that I could in no wise\ndoubt either that He was within me, or that I was wholly absorbed\nin Him.  It was not by way of vision; I believe it was what is\ncalled mystical theology.   The soul is suspended in such a way\nthat it seems to be utterly beside itself.  The will loves; the\nmemory, so it seems to me, is as it were lost; and the\nunderstanding, so I think, makes no reflections--yet is not lost:\nas I have just said, it is not at work, but it stands as if\namazed at the greatness of the things it understands; for God\nwills it to understand that it understands nothing whatever of\nthat which His Majesty places before it.\n2. Before this, I had a certain tenderness of soul which was very\nabiding, partially attainable, I believe, in some measure, by our\nown efforts: a consolation which is not wholly in the senses, nor\nyet altogether in the spirit, but is all of it the gift of God.\nHowever, I think we can contribute much towards the attaining of\nit by considering our vileness and our ingratitude towards\nGod--the great things He has done for us--His Passion, with its\ngrievous pains--and His life, so full of sorrows; also, by\nrejoicing in the contemplation of His works, of His greatness,\nand of the love that He bears us.  Many other considerations\nthere are which he who really desires to make progress will often\nstumble on, though he may not be very much on the watch for them.\nIf with this there be a little love, the soul is comforted, the\nheart is softened, and tears flow.  Sometimes it seems that we do\nviolence to ourselves and weep; at other times, our Lord seems to\ndo so, so that we have no power to resist Him.  His Majesty seems\nto reward this slight carefulness of ours with so grand a gift as\nis this consolation which He ministers to the soul of seeing\nitself weeping for so great a Lord.  I am not surprised; for the\nsoul has reason enough, and more than enough, for its joy.  Here\nit comforts itself--here it rejoices.\n3. The comparison which now presents itself seems to me to be\ngood.  These joys in prayer are like what those of heaven must\nbe.  As the vision of the saints, which is measured by their\nmerits there, reaches no further than our Lord wills, and as the\nblessed see how little merit they had, every one of them is\nsatisfied with the place assigned him: there being the very\ngreatest difference between one joy and another in heaven, and\nmuch greater than between one spiritual joy and another on\nearth--which is, however, very great.  And in truth, in the\nbeginning, a soul in which God works this grace thinks that now\nit has scarcely anything more to desire, and counts itself\nabundantly rewarded for all the service it has rendered Him.\nAnd there is reason for this: for one of those tears--which, as I\nhave just said, are almost in our own power, though without God\nnothing can be done--cannot, in my opinion, be purchased with all\nthe labours of the world, because of the great gain it brings us.\nAnd what greater gain can we have than some testimony of our\nhaving pleased God?  Let him, then, who shall have attained to\nthis, give praise unto God--acknowledge himself to be one of His\ngreatest debtors; because it seems to be His will to take him\ninto His house, having chosen him for His kingdom, if he does not\nturn back.\n4. Let him not regard certain kinds of humility which exist, and\nof which I mean to speak. [3]  Some think it humility not to\nbelieve that God is bestowing His gifts upon them.  Let us\nclearly understand this, and that it is perfectly clear God\nbestows His gifts without any merit whatever on our part; and let\nus be grateful to His Majesty for them; for if we do not\nrecognize the gifts received at His hands, we shall never be\nmoved to love Him.  It is a most certain truth, that the richer\nwe see ourselves to be, confessing at the same time our poverty,\nthe greater will be our progress, and the more real our humility.\n5. An opposite course tends to take away all courage; for we\nshall think ourselves incapable of great blessings, if we begin\nto frighten ourselves with the dread of vain-glory when our Lord\nbegins to show His mercy upon us. [4]  Let us believe that He Who\ngives these gifts will also, when the devil begins to tempt us\nherein, give us the grace to detect him, and the strength to\nresist him--that is, He will do so if we walk in simplicity\nbefore God, aiming at pleasing Him only, and not men.  It is a\nmost evident truth, that our love for a person is greater, the\nmore distinctly we remember the good he has done us.\n6. If, then, it is lawful, and so meritorious, always to remember\nthat we have our being from God, that He has created us out of\nnothing, that He preserves us, and also to remember all the\nbenefits of His death and Passion, which He suffered long before\nHe made us for every one of us now alive--why should it not be\nlawful for me to discern, confess, and consider often that I was\nonce accustomed to speak of vanities, and that now our Lord has\ngiven me the grace to speak only of Himself?\n7. Here, then, is a precious pearl, which, when we remember that\nit is given us, and that we have it in possession, powerfully\ninvites us to love.  All this is the fruit of prayer founded on\nhumility.  What, then, will it be when we shall find ourselves in\npossession of other pearls of greater price, such as contempt of\nthe world and of self, which some servants of God have already\nreceived?  It is clear that such souls must consider themselves\ngreater debtors--under greater obligations to serve Him: we must\nacknowledge that we have nothing of ourselves, and confess the\nmunificence of our Lord, Who, on a soul so wretched and poor, and\nso utterly undeserving, as mine is,--for whom the first of these\npearls was enough, and more than enough,--would bestow greater\nriches than I could desire.\n8. We must renew our strength to serve Him, and strive not to be\nungrateful, because it is on this condition that our Lord\ndispenses His treasures; for if we do not make a good use of\nthem, and of the high estate to which He raises us, He will\nreturn and take them from us, and we shall be poorer than ever.\nHis Majesty will give the pearls to him who shall bring them\nforth and employ them usefully for himself and others.  For how\nshall he be useful, and how shall he spend liberally, who does\nnot know that he is rich?  It is not possible, I think, our\nnature being what it is, that he can have the courage necessary\nfor great things who does not know that God is on his side; for\nso miserable are we, so inclined to the things of this world,\nthat he can hardly have any real abhorrence of, with great\ndetachment from, all earthly things who does not see that he\nholds some pledges for those things that are above.  It is by\nthese gifts that our Lord gives us that strength which we through\nour sins have lost.\n9. A man will hardly wish to be held in contempt and abhorrence,\nnor will he seek after the other great virtues to which the\nperfect attain, if he has not some pledges of the love which God\nbears him, together with a living faith.  Our nature is so dead,\nthat we go after that which we see immediately before us; and it\nis these graces, therefore, that quicken and strengthen our\nfaith.  It may well be that I, who am so wicked, measure others\nby myself, and that others require nothing more than the verities\nof the faith, in order to render their works most perfect; while\nI, wretched that I am! have need of everything.\n10. Others will explain this.  I speak from my own experience, as\nI have been commanded; and if what I say be not correct, let\nhim [5] to whom I send it destroy it; for he knows better than I\ndo what is wrong in it.  I entreat him, for the love of our Lord,\nto publish abroad what I have thus far said of my wretched life,\nand of my sins.  I give him leave to do so; and to all my\nconfessors, also,--of whom he is one--to whom this is to be sent,\nif it be their pleasure, even during my life, so that I may no\nlonger deceive people who think there must be some good in\nme.  [6] Certainly, I speak in all sincerity, so far as I\nunderstand myself.  Such publication will give me great comfort.\n11. But as to that which I am now going to say, I give no such\nleave; nor, if it be shown to any one, do I consent to its being\nsaid who the person is whose experience it describes, nor who\nwrote it.  This is why I mention neither my own name, nor that of\nany other person whatever.  I have written it in the best way I\ncould, in order not to be known; and this I beg of them for the\nlove of God.  Persons so learned and grave as they are [7] have\nauthority enough to approve of whatever right things I may say,\nshould our Lord give me the grace to do so; and if I should say\nanything of the kind, it will be His, and not mine--because I am\nneither learned nor of good life, and I have no person of\nlearning or any other to teach me; for they only who ordered me\nto write know that I am writing, and at this moment they are not\nhere.  I have, as it were, to steal the time, and that with\ndifficulty, because my writing hinders me from spinning.  I am\nliving in a house that is poor, and have many things to do. [8]\nIf, indeed, our Lord had given me greater abilities and a better\nmemory, I might then profit by what I have seen and read; but my\nabilities are very slight.  If, then, I should say anything that\nis right, our Lord will have it said for some good purpose; that\nwhich may be wrong will be mine, and your reverence will strike\nit out.\n12. In neither case will it be of any use to publish my name:\nduring my life, it is clear that no good I may have done ought to\nbe told; after death, there is no reason against it, except that\nit will lose all authority and credit, because related of a\nperson so vile and so wicked as I am.  And because I think your\nreverence and the others who may see this writing will do this\nthat I ask of you, for the love of our Lord, I write with\nfreedom.  If it were not so, I should have great scruples, except\nin declaring my sins: and in that matter I should have none at\nall.  For the rest, it is enough that I am a woman to make my\nsails droop: how much more, then, when I am a woman, and a\nwicked one?\n13. So, then, everything here beyond the simple story of my life\nyour reverence must take upon yourself--since you have so pressed\nme to give some account of the graces which our Lord bestowed\nupon me in prayer--if it be consistent with the truths of our\nholy Catholic faith; if it be not, your reverence must burn it at\nonce--for I give my consent.  I will recount my experience, in\norder that, if it be consistent with those truths, your reverence\nmay make some use of it; if not, you will deliver my soul from\ndelusion, so that Satan may gain nothing there where I seemed to\nbe gaining myself.  Our Lord knows well that I, as I shall show\nhereafter, [9] have always laboured to find out those who could\ngive me light.\n14. How clear soever I may wish to make my account of that which\nrelates to prayer, it will be obscure enough for those who are\nwithout experience.  I shall speak of certain hindrances, which,\nas I understand it, keep men from advancing on this road--and of\nother things which are dangerous, as our Lord has taught me by\nexperience.  I have also discussed the matter with men of great\nlearning, with persons who for many years had lived spiritual\nlives, who admit that, in the twenty-seven years only during\nwhich I have given myself to prayer--though I walked so ill, and\nstumbled so often on the road--His Majesty granted me that\nexperience which others attain to in seven-and-thirty, or\nseven-and-forty, years; and they, too, being persons who ever\nadvanced in the way of penance and of virtue.\n15. Blessed be God for all, and may His infinite Majesty make use\nof me!  Our Lord knoweth well that I have no other end in this\nthan that He may be praised and magnified a little, when men\nshall see that on a dunghill so foul and rank He has made a\ngarden of flowers so sweet.  May it please His Majesty that I may\nnot by my own fault root them out, and become again what I was\nbefore.  And I entreat your reverence, for the love of our Lord,\nto beg this of Him for me, seeing that you have a clearer\nknowledge of what I am than you have allowed me to give of\nmyself here.\n1.

The Doctrine\nProfitable for Beginners, and for Those Who Have No\nSensible Sweetness.\n1. I speak now of those who begin to be the servants of love;\nthat seems to me to be nothing else but to resolve to follow Him\nin the way of prayer, who has loved us so much.  It is a dignity\nso great, that I have a strange joy in thinking of it; for\nservile fear vanishes at once, if we are, as we ought to be, in\nthe first degree.  O Lord of my soul, and my good, how is it\nthat, when a soul is determined to love Thee--doing all it can,\nby forsaking all things, in order that it may the better occupy\nitself with the love of God--it is not Thy will it should have\nthe joy of ascending at once to the possession of perfect love?\nI have spoken amiss; I ought to have said, and my complaint\nshould have been, why is it we do not? for the fault is wholly\nour own that we do not rejoice at once in a dignity so great,\nseeing that the attaining to the perfect possession of this true\nlove brings all blessings with it.\n2. We think so much of ourselves, and are so dilatory in giving\nourselves wholly to God, that, as His Majesty will not let us\nhave the fruition of that which is so precious but at a great\ncost, so neither do we perfectly prepare ourselves for it.  I see\nplainly that there is nothing by which so great a good can be\nprocured in this world.  If, however, we did what we could, not\nclinging to anything upon earth, but having all our thoughts and\nconversation in Heaven, I believe that this blessing would\nquickly be given us, provided we perfectly prepared ourselves for\nit at once, as some of the saints have done.  We think we are\ngiving all to God; but, in fact, we are offering only the revenue\nor the produce, while we retain the fee-simple of the land in our\nown possession.\n3. We resolve to become poor, and it is a resolution of great\nmerit; but we very often take great care not to be in want, not\nsimply of what is necessary, but of what is superfluous: yea, and\nto make for ourselves friends who may supply us; and in this way\nwe take more pains, and perhaps expose ourselves to greater\ndanger, in order that we may want nothing, than we did formerly,\nwhen we had our own possessions in our own power.\n4. We thought, also, that we gave up all desire of honour when we\nbecame religious, or when we began the spiritual life, and\nfollowed after perfection; and yet, when we are touched on the\npoint of honour, we do not then remember that we had given it up\nto God.  We would seize it again, and take it, as they say, out\nof His Hands, even after we had made Him, to all appearance, the\nLord of our own will.  So is it in every thing else.\n5. A pleasant way this of seeking the love of God! we retain our\nown affections, and yet will have that love, as they say, by\nhandfuls.  We make no efforts to bring our desires to good\neffect, or to raise them resolutely above the earth; and yet,\nwith all this, we must have many spiritual consolations.  This is\nnot well, and we are seeking things that are incompatible one\nwith the other.  So, because we do not give ourselves up wholly\nand at once, this treasure is not given wholly and at once to us.\nMay it be the good pleasure of our Lord to give it us drop by\ndrop, though it may cost us all the trials in the world.\n6. He showeth great mercy unto him to whom He gives the grace and\nresolution to strive for this blessing with all his might; for\nGod withholds Himself from no one who perseveres.  He will by\nlittle and little strengthen that soul, so that it may come forth\nvictorious.  I say resolution, because of the multitude of those\nthings which Satan puts before it at first, to keep it back from\nbeginning to travel on this road; for he knoweth what harm will\nbefall him thereby--he will lose not only that soul, but many\nothers also.  If he who enters on this road does violence to\nhimself, with the help of God, so as to reach the summit of\nperfection, such a one, I believe, will never go alone to Heaven;\nhe will always take many with him: God gives to him, as to a good\ncaptain, those who shall be of his company.\n7. Thus, then, the dangers and difficulties which Satan puts\nbefore them are so many, that they have need, not of a little,\nbut of a very great, resolution, and great grace from God, to\nsave them from falling away.\n8. Speaking, then, of their beginnings who are determined to\nfollow after this good, and to succeed in their enterprise--what\nI began to say [1] of mystical theology--I believe they call it\nby that name--I shall proceed with hereafter--I have to say that\nthe labour is greatest at first; for it is they who toil, our\nLord, indeed, giving them strength.  In the other degrees of\nprayer, there is more of fruition; although they who are in the\nbeginning, the middle, and the end, have their crosses to carry:\nthe crosses, however, are different.  They who would follow\nChrist, if they do not wish to be lost, must walk in the way He\nwalked Himself.  Blessed labours! even here, in this life, so\nsuperabundantly rewarded!\n9. I shall have to make use of a comparison; I should like to\navoid it, because I am a woman, and write simply what I have been\ncommanded.  But this language of spirituality is so difficult of\nutterance for those who are not learned, and such am I.  I have\ntherefore to seek for some means to make the matter plain.\nIt may be that the comparison will very rarely be to the\npurpose--your reverence will be amused when you see my stupidity.\nI think, now, I have either read or heard of this comparison; but\nas my memory is bad, I know not where, nor on what occasion;\nhowever, I am satisfied with it for my present purpose. [2]\n10. A beginner must look upon himself as making a garden, wherein\nour Lord may take His delight, but in a soil unfruitful, and\nabounding in weeds.  His Majesty roots up the weeds, and has to\nplant good herbs.  Let us, then, take for granted that this is\nalready done when a soul is determined to give itself to prayer,\nand has begun the practice of it.  We have, then, as good\ngardeners, by the help of God, to see that the plants grow, to\nwater them carefully, that they may not die, but produce\nblossoms, which shall send forth much fragrance, refreshing to\nour Lord, so that He may come often for His pleasure into this\ngarden, and delight Himself in the midst of these virtues.\n11. Let us now see how this garden is to be watered, that we may\nunderstand what we have to do: how much trouble it will cost us,\nwhether the gain be greater than the trouble, or how long a time\nit will take us.  It seems to me that the garden may be watered\nin four ways: by water taken out of a well, which is very\nlaborious; or with water raised by means of an engine and\nbuckets, drawn by a windlass--I have drawn it this way\nsometimes--it is a less troublesome way than the first, and gives\nmore water; or by a stream or brook, whereby the garden is\nwatered in a much better way--for the soil is more thoroughly\nsaturated, and there is no necessity to water it so often, and\nthe labour of the gardener is much less; or by showers of rain,\nwhen our Lord Himself waters it, without labour on our part--and\nthis way is incomparably better than all the others of which I\nhave spoken.\n12. Now, then, for the application of these four ways of\nirrigation by which the garden is to be maintained; for without\nwater it must fail.  The comparison is to my purpose, and it\nseems to me that by the help of it I shall be able to explain, in\nsome measure, the four degrees of prayer to which our Lord, of\nHis goodness, has occasionally raised my soul.  May He graciously\ngrant that I may so speak as to be of some service to one of\nthose who has commanded me to write, whom our Lord has raised in\nfour months to a greater height than I have reached in seventeen\nyears!  He prepared himself better than I did, and therefore is\nhis garden without labour on his part, irrigated by these four\nwaters--though the last of them is only drop by drop; but it is\ngrowing in such a way, that soon, by the help of our Lord, he\nwill be swallowed up therein, and it will be a pleasure to me, if\nhe finds my explanation absurd, that he should laugh at it.\n13. Of those who are beginners in prayer, we may say, that they\nare those who draw the water up out of the well--a process which,\nas I have said, is very laborious; for they must be wearied in\nkeeping the senses recollected, and this is a great labour,\nbecause the senses have been hitherto accustomed to distractions.\nIt is necessary for beginners to accustom themselves to disregard\nwhat they hear or see, and to put it away from them during the\ntime of prayer; they must be alone, and in retirement think over\ntheir past life.  Though all must do this many times, beginners\nas well as those more advanced; all, however, must not do so\nequally, as I shall show hereafter. [3] Beginners at first suffer\nmuch, because they are not convinced that they are penitent for\ntheir sins; and yet they are, because they are so sincerely\nresolved on serving God.  They must strive to meditate on the\nlife of Christ, and the understanding is wearied thereby.\nThus far we can advance of ourselves--that is, by the grace of\nGod--for without that, as every one knows, we never can have one\ngood thought.\n14. This is beginning to draw water up out of the well.\nGod grant there may be water in it!  That, however, does not\ndepend on us; we are drawing it, and doing what we can towards\nwatering the flowers.  So good is God, that when, for reasons\nknown to His Majesty--perhaps for our greater good--it is His\nwill the well should be dry, He Himself preserves the flowers\nwithout water--we, like good gardeners, doing what lies in our\npower--and makes our virtues grow.  By water here I mean tears,\nand if there be none, then tenderness and an inward feeling\nof devotion.\n15. What, then, will he do here who sees that, for many days, he\nis conscious only of aridity, disgust, dislike, and so great an\nunwillingness to go to the well for water, that he would give it\nup altogether, if he did not remember that he has to please and\nserve the Lord of the garden; if he did not trust that his\nservice was not in vain, and did not hope for some gain by a\nlabour so great as that of lowering the bucket into the well so\noften, and drawing it up without water in it?  It will happen\nthat he is often unable to move his arms for that purpose, or to\nhave one good thought: working with the understanding is drawing\nwater out of the well.\n16. What, then, once more, will the gardener do now?  He must\nrejoice and take comfort, and consider it as the greatest favour\nto labour in the garden of so great an Emperor; and as he knows\nthat he is pleasing Him in the matter--and his purpose must not\nbe to please himself, but Him--let him praise Him greatly for the\ntrust He has in him--for He sees that, without any recompense, he\nis taking so much care of that which has been confided to him;\nlet him help Him to carry the Cross, and let him think how He\ncarried it all His life long; let him not seek his kingdom here,\nnor ever intermit his prayer; and so let him resolve, if this\naridity should last even his whole life long, never to let Christ\nfall down beneath the Cross. [4]\n17. The time will come when he shall be paid once for all.\nLet him have no fear that his labour is in vain: he serves a good\nMaster, Whose eyes are upon him.  Let him make no account of evil\nthoughts, but remember that Satan suggested them to St. Jerome\nalso in the desert. [5]  These labours have their reward, I know\nit; for I am one who underwent them for many years.  When I drew\nbut one drop of water out of this blessed well, I considered it\nwas a mercy of God.  I know these labours are very great, and\nrequire, I think, greater courage than many others in this world;\nbut I have seen clearly that God does not leave them without a\ngreat recompense, even in this life; for it is very certain that\nin one hour, during which our Lord  gave me to taste His\nsweetness, all the anxieties which I had to bear when persevering\nin prayer seem to me ever afterwards perfectly rewarded.\n18. I believe that it is our Lord's good pleasure frequently in\nthe beginning, and at times in the end, to send these torments,\nand many other incidental temptations, to try those who love Him,\nand to ascertain if they will drink the chalice, [6] and help Him\nto carry the Cross, before He intrusts them with His great\ntreasures.  I believe it to be for our good that His Majesty\nshould lead us by this way, so that we may perfectly understand\nhow worthless we are; for the graces which He gives afterwards\nare of a dignity so great, that He will have us by experience\nknow our wretchedness before He grants them, that it may not be\nwith us as it was with Lucifer.\n19. What canst Thou do, O my Lord, that is not for the greater\ngood of that soul which Thou knowest to be already Thine, and\nwhich gives itself up to Thee to follow Thee whithersoever Thou\ngoest, even to the death of the Cross; and which is determined to\nhelp Thee to carry that Cross, and not to leave Thee alone with\nit?  He who shall discern this resolution in himself has nothing\nto fear: no, no; spiritual people have nothing to fear.  There is\nno reason why he should be distressed who is already raised to so\nhigh a degree as this is of wishing to converse in solitude with\nGod, and to abandon the amusements of the world.  The greater\npart of the work is done; give praise to His Majesty for it, and\ntrust in His goodness who has never failed those who love Him.\nClose the eyes of your imagination, and do not ask why He gives\ndevotion to this person in so short a time, and none to me after\nso many years.  Let us believe that all is for our greater good;\nlet His Majesty guide us whithersoever He will: we are not our\nown, but His.  He shows us mercy enough when it is His pleasure\nwe should be willing to dig in His garden, and to be so near the\nLord of it: He certainly is near to us.  If it be His will that\nthese plants and flowers should grow--some of them when He gives\nwater we may draw from the well, others when He gives none--what\nis that to me?  Do Thou, O Lord, accomplish Thy will; let me\nnever offend Thee, nor let my virtues perish; if Thou hast given\nme any, it is out of Thy mere goodness.  I wish to suffer,\nbecause Thou, O Lord, hast suffered; do Thou in every way fulfil\nThy will in me, and may it never be the pleasure of Thy Majesty\nthat a gift of so high a price as that of Thy love, be given to\npeople who serve Thee only because of the sweetness they\nfind thereby.\n20. It is much to be observed, and I say so because I know by\nexperience, that the soul which, begins to walk in the way of\nmental prayer with resolution, and is determined not to care\nmuch, neither to rejoice nor to be greatly afflicted, whether\nsweetness and tenderness fail it, or our Lord grants them, has\nalready travelled a great part of the road.  Let that soul, then,\nhave no fear that it is going back, though it may frequently\nstumble; for the building is begun on a firm foundation.  It is\ncertain that the love of God does not consist in tears, nor in\nthis sweetness and tenderness which we for the most part desire,\nand with which we console ourselves; but rather in serving Him in\njustice, fortitude, and humility.  That seems to me to be a\nreceiving rather than a giving of anything on our part.\n21. As for poor women, such as I am, weak and infirm of purpose,\nit seems to me to be necessary that I should be led on through\nconsolations, as God is doing now, so that I might be able to\nendure certain afflictions which it has pleased His Majesty I\nshould have.  But when the servants of God, who are men of\nweight, learning, and sense, make so much account, as I see they\ndo, whether God gives them sweetness in devotion or not, I am\ndisgusted when I listen to them.  I do not say that they ought\nnot to accept it, and make much of it, when God gives\nit--because, when He gives it, His Majesty sees it to be\nnecessary for them--but I do say that they ought not to grow\nweary when they have it not.  They should then understand that\nthey have no need of it, and be masters of themselves, when His\nMajesty does not give it.  Let them be convinced of this, there\nis a fault here; I have had experience of it, and know it to be\nso.  Let them believe it as an imperfection: they are not\nadvancing in liberty of spirit, but shrinking like cowards from\nthe assault.\n22. It is not so much to beginners that I say this--though I do\ninsist upon it, because it is of great importance to them that\nthey should begin with this liberty and resolution--as to others,\nof whom there are many, who make a beginning, but never come to\nthe end; and that is owing, I believe, in great measure, to their\nnot having embraced the Cross from the first.  They are\ndistressed, thinking they are doing nothing; the understanding\nceases from its acts, and they cannot bear it.  Yet, perhaps, at\nthat very time, the will is feeding and gathering strength, and\nthey know it not.\n23. We must suppose that our Lord does not regard these things;\nfor though they seem to us to be faults, yet they are not.\nHis Majesty knoweth our misery and natural vileness better than\nwe do ourselves.  He knoweth that these souls long to be always\nthinking of Him and loving Him.  It is this resolution that He\nseeks in us; the other anxieties which we inflict upon ourselves\nserve to no other end but to disquiet the soul--which, if it be\nunable to derive any profit in one hour, will by them be disabled\nfor four.  This comes most frequently from bodily\nindisposition--I have had very great experience in the matter,\nand I know it is true; for I have carefully observed it and\ndiscussed it afterwards with spiritual persons--for we are so\nwretched, that this poor prisoner of a soul shares in the\nmiseries of the body. The changes of the seasons, and the\nalterations of the humours, very often compel it, without fault\nof its own, not to do what it would, but rather to suffer in\nevery way.  Meanwhile, the more we force the soul on these\noccasions, the greater the mischief, and the longer it lasts.\nSome discretion must be used, in order to ascertain whether\nill-health be the occasion or not.  The poor soul must not be\nstifled.  Let those who thus suffer understand that they are ill;\na change should be made in the hour of prayer, and oftentimes\nthat change should be continued for some days. Let souls pass out\nof this desert as they can, for it is very often the misery of\none that loves God to see itself living in such wretchedness,\nunable to do what it would, because it has to keep so evil a\nguest as the body.\n24. I spoke of discretion, because sometimes the devil will do\nthe same work; and so it is not always right to omit prayer when\nthe understanding is greatly distracted and disturbed, nor to\ntorment the soul to the doing of that which is out of its power.\nThere are other things then to be done--exterior works, as of\ncharity and spiritual reading--though at times the soul will not\nbe able to do them.  Take care, then, of the body, for the love\nof God, because at many other times the body must serve the soul;\nand let recourse be had to some recreations--holy ones--such as\nconversation, or going out into the fields, as the confessor\nshall advise.  Altogether, experience is a great matter, and it\nmakes us understand what is convenient for us. Let God be served\nin all things--His yoke is sweet; [7] and it is of great\nimportance that the soul should not be dragged, as they say, but\ncarried gently, that it may make greater progress.\n25. So, then, I come back to what I advised before [8]--and\nthough I repeat it often, it matters not; it is of great\nimportance that no one should distress himself on account of\naridities, or because his thoughts are restless and distracted;\nneither should he be afflicted thereat, if he would attain to\nliberty of spirit, and not be always in trouble.  Let him begin\nby not being afraid of the Cross, and he will see how our Lord\nwill help him to carry it, how joyfully he will advance, and what\nprofit he will derive from it all.  It is now clear, if there is\nno water in the well, that we at least can put none into it.\nIt is true we must not be careless about drawing it when there is\nany in it, because at that time it is the will of God to multiply\nour virtues by means thereof.\nNOTES\n1.

The Evil of Desiring to Attain to\nSupernatural States Before Our Lord Calls Us.\n1. My aim in the foregoing chapter--though I digressed to many\nother matters, because they seemed to me very necessary--was to\nexplain how much we may attain to of ourselves; and how, in these\nbeginnings of devotion, we are able in some degree to help\nourselves: because thinking of, and pondering on, the sufferings\nof our Lord for our sakes moves us to compassion, and the sorrow\nand tears which result therefrom are sweet.  The thought of the\nblessedness we hope for, of the love our Lord bore us, and of His\nresurrection, kindle within us a joy which is neither wholly\nspiritual nor wholly sensual; but the joy is virtuous, and the\nsorrow is most meritorious.\n2. Of this kind are all those things which produce a devotion\nacquired in part by means of the understanding, though it can\nneither be merited nor had, if God grants it not.  It is best for\na soul which God has not raised to a higher state than this not\nto try to rise of itself.  Let this be well considered, because\nall the soul will gain in that way will be a loss.  In this state\nit can make many acts of good resolutions to do much for God, and\nenkindle its love; other acts also, which may help the growth of\nvirtues, according to that which is written in a book called The\nArt of Serving God, [1] a most excellent work, and profitable for\nthose who are in this state, because the understanding is\nactive now.\n3. The soul may also place itself in the presence of Christ, and\naccustom itself to many acts of love directed to His sacred\nHumanity, and remain in His presence continually, and speak to\nHim, pray to Him in its necessities, and complain to Him of its\ntroubles; be merry with Him in its joys, and yet not forget Him\nbecause of its joys.  All this it may do without set prayers, but\nrather with words befitting its desires and its needs.\n4. This is an excellent way whereby to advance, and that very\nquickly.  He that will strive to have this precious\ncompanionship, and will make much of it, and will sincerely love\nour Lord, to whom we owe so much, is one, in my opinion, who has\nmade some progress.  There is therefore no reason why we should\ntrouble ourselves because we have no sensible devotion, as I said\nbefore. [2]  But let us rather give thanks to our Lord, who\nallows us to have a desire to please Him, though our works be\npoor. This practice of the presence of Christ is profitable in\nall states of prayer, and is a most safe way of advancing in the\nfirst state, and of attaining quickly to the second; and as for\nthe last states, it secures us against those risks which the\ndevil may occasion.\n5. This, then, is what we can do.  He who would pass out of this\nstate, and upraise his spirit, in order to taste consolations\ndenied him, will, in my opinion, lose both the one and the\nother. [3]  These consolations being supernatural, and the\nunderstanding inactive, the soul is then left desolate and in\ngreat aridity.  As the foundation of the whole building is\nhumility, the nearer we draw unto God the more this virtue should\ngrow; if it does not, everything is lost.  It seems to be a kind\nof pride when we seek to ascend higher, seeing that God descends\nso low, when He allows us, being what we are, to draw near\nunto Him.\n6. It must not be supposed that I am now speaking of raising our\nthoughts to the consideration of the high things of heaven and of\nits glory, or unto God and His great wisdom.  I never did this\nmyself, because I had not the capacity for it--as I said\nbefore; [4] and I was so worthless, that, as to thinking even of\nthe things of earth, God gave me grace to understand this truth:\nthat in me it was no slight boldness to do so.  How much more,\nthen, the thinking of heavenly things?  Others, however, will\nprofit in that way, particularly those who are learned; for\nlearning, in my opinion, is a great treasury in the matter of\nthis exercise, if it be accompanied with humility.  I observed\nthis a few days ago in some learned men who had shortly before\nmade a beginning, and had made great progress.  This is the\nreason why I am so very anxious that many learned men may become\nspiritual. I shall speak of this by and by. [5]\n7. What I am saying--namely, let them not rise if God does not\nraise them--is the language of spirituality.  He will understand\nme who has had any experience; and I know not how to explain it,\nif what I have said does not make it plain.\n8. In mystical theology--of which I spoke before [6]--the\nunderstanding ceases from its acts, because God suspends it--as I\nshall explain by and by, if I can; [7] and God give me the grace\nto do so.  We must neither imagine nor think that we can of\nourselves bring about this suspension.  That is what I say must\nnot be done; nor must we allow the understanding to cease from\nits acts; for in that case we shall be stupid and cold, and the\nresult will be neither the one nor the other.  For when our Lord\nsuspends the understanding, and makes it cease from its acts, He\nputs before it that which astonishes and occupies it: so that\nwithout making any reflections, it shall comprehend in a\nmoment [8] more than we could comprehend in many years with all\nthe efforts in the world.\n9. To have the powers of the mind occupied, and to think that you\ncan keep them at the same time quiet, is folly.  I repeat it,\nthough it be not so understood, there is no great humility in\nthis; and, if it be blameless, it is not left unpunished--it is\nlabour thrown away, and the soul is a little disgusted: it feels\nlike a man about to take a leap, and is held back.  Such a one\nseems to have used up his strength already, and finds himself\nunable to do that which he wished to have done: so here, in the\nscanty gain that remains, he who will consider the matter will\ntrace that slight want of humility of which I have spoken; [9]\nfor that virtue has this excellence: there is no good work\nattended by humility that leaves the soul disgusted.  It seems to\nme that I have made this clear enough; yet, after all, perhaps\nonly for myself.  May our Lord open their eyes who read this, by\ngiving them experience; and then however slight that experience\nmay be, they will immediately understand it.\n10. For many years I read much, and understood nothing; and for a\nlong time, too, though God gave me understanding herein, I never\ncould utter a word by which I might explain it to others.\nThis was no little trouble to me.  When His Majesty pleases, He\nteaches everything in a moment, so that I am lost in wonder.\nOne thing I can truly say: though I conversed with many spiritual\npersons, who sought to make me understand what our Lord was\ngiving me, in order that I might be able to speak of it, the fact\nis, that my dulness was so great, that I derived no advantage\nwhatever, much or little, from their teaching.\n11. Or it may be, as His Majesty has always been my Master--may\nHe be blessed for ever! for I am ashamed of myself that I can say\nso with truth--that it was His good pleasure I should meet with\nno one to whom I should be indebted in this matter.  So, without\nmy wishing or asking it--I never was careful about this, for that\nwould have been a virtue in me, but only about vanity--God gave\nme to understand with all distinctness in a moment, and also\nenabled me to express myself, so that my confessors were\nastonished but I more than they, because I knew my own dulness\nbetter.  It is not long since this happened.  And so that which\nour Lord has not taught me, I seek not to know it, unless it be a\nmatter that touches my conscience.\n12. Again I repeat my advice: it is of great moment not to raise\nour spirit ourselves, if our Lord does not raise it for us; and\nif He does, there can be no mistaking it.  For women, it is\nspecially wrong, because the devil can delude them--though I am\ncertain our Lord will never allow him to hurt any one who labours\nto draw near unto God in humility.  On the contrary, such a one\nwill derive more profit and advantage out of that attack by which\nSatan intended to hurt him.\n13. I have dwelt so long upon this matter because this way of\nprayer is the most common with beginners, and because the advice\nI have given is very important.  It will be found much better\ngiven elsewhere: that I admit; and I admit, also, that in writing\nit I am ashamed of myself, and covered with confusion--though not\nso much so as I ought to be.  Blessed for ever be our Lord, of\nwhose will and pleasure it is that I am allowed, being what I am,\nto speak of things which are His, of such a nature, and so deep.\n1.

That is, he will lose the prayer of acquired quiet, because he\nvoluntarily abandons it before the time; and will not attain to\nthe prayer of infused quiet, because he attempts to rise into it\nbefore he is called (Francis. de Sancto Thoma, Medulla Mystica,\ntr. iv. ch. xi. n. 69).\n4.

Instructions Relating Thereto.\n1. I have thought it right to speak of certain temptations I have\nobserved to which beginners are liable--some of them I have had\nmyself--and to give some advice about certain things which to me\nseem necessary.  In the beginning, then, we should strive to be\ncheerful and unconstrained; for there are people who think it is\nall over with devotion if they relax themselves ever so little.\nIt is right to be afraid of self; so that, having no confidence\nin ourselves, much or little, we may not place ourselves in those\ncircumstances wherein men usually sin against God; for it is a\nmost necessary fear, till we become very perfect in virtue.\nAnd there are not many who are so perfect as to be able to relax\nthemselves on those occasions which offer temptations to their\nnatural temper; for always while we live, were it only to\npreserve humility, it is well we should know our own miserable\nnature; but there are many occasions on which it is permitted\nus--as I said just now [1]--to take some recreation, in order\nthat we may with more vigour resume our prayer.\n2. Discretion is necessary throughout.  We must have great\nconfidence; because it is very necessary for us not to contract\nour desires, but put our trust in God; for, if we do violence to\nourselves by little and little, we shall, though not at once,\nreach that height which many Saints by His grace have reached.\nIf they had never resolved to desire, and had never by little and\nlittle acted upon that resolve, they never could have ascended to\nso high a state.\n3. His Majesty seeks and loves courageous souls; but they must be\nhumble in their ways, and have no confidence in themselves.\nI never saw one of those lag behind on the road; and never a\ncowardly soul, though aided by humility, make that progress in\nmany years which the former makes in a few.  I am astonished at\nthe great things done on this road by encouraging oneself to\nundertake great things, though we may not have the strength for\nthem at once; the soul takes a flight upwards and ascends high,\nthough, like a little bird whose wings are weak, it grows weary\nand rests.\n4. At one time I used often to think of those words of St. Paul:\n\"That all things are possible in God.\" [2]  I saw clearly that of\nmyself I could do nothing.  This was of great service to me.\nSo also was the saying of St. Augustine: \"Give me, O Lord, what\nThou commandest, and command what Thou wilt.\" [3]  I was often\nthinking how St. Peter lost nothing by throwing himself into the\nsea, though he was afterwards afraid. [4]  These first\nresolutions are a great matter--although it is necessary in the\nbeginning that we should be very reserved, controlled by the\ndiscretion and authority of a director; but we must take care\nthat he be one who does not teach us to crawl like toads, nor one\nwho may be satisfied when the soul shows itself fit only to catch\nlizards.  Humility must always go before: so that we may know\nthat this strength can come out of no strength of our own.\n5. But it is necessary we should understand what manner of\nhumility this should be, because Satan, I believe, does great\nharm; for he hinders those who begin to pray from going onwards,\nby suggesting to them false notions of humility.  He makes them\nthink it is pride to have large desires, to wish to imitate the\nSaints, and to long for martyrdom.  He tells us forthwith, or he\nmakes us think, that the actions of the Saints are to be admired,\nnot to be imitated, by us who are sinners.  I, too, say the same\nthing; but we must see what those actions are which we are to\nadmire, and what those are which we are to imitate; for it would\nbe wrong in a person who is weak and sickly to undertake much\nfasting and sharp penances to retire into the desert, where he\ncould not sleep, nor find anything to eat; or, indeed, to\nundertake any austerities of this kind.\n6. But we ought to think that we can force ourselves, by the\ngrace of God, to hold the world in profound contempt--to make\nlight of honour, and be detached from our possessions.\nOur hearts, however, are so mean that we think the earth would\nfail us under our feet, if we were to cease to care even for a\nmoment for the body, and give ourselves up to spirituality.\nThen we think that to have all we require contributes to\nrecollection, because anxieties disturb prayer.  It is painful to\nme that our confidence in God is so scanty, and our self-love so\nstrong, as that any anxiety about our own necessities should\ndisturb us. But so it is; for when our spiritual progress is so\nslight, a mere nothing will give us as much trouble as great and\nimportant matters will give to others.  And we think\nourselves spiritual!\n7. Now, to me, this way of going on seems to betray a disposition\nto reconcile soul and body together, in order that we may not\nmiss our ease in this world, and yet have the fruition of God in\nthe next; and so it will be if we walk according to justice,\nclinging to virtue; but it is the pace of a hen--it will never\nbring us to liberty of spirit.  It is a course of proceeding, as\nit seems to me, most excellent for those who are in the married\nstate, and who must live according to their vocation; but for the\nother state, I by no means wish for such a method of progress,\nneither can I be made to believe it to be sound; for I have tried\nit, and I should have remained in that way, if our Lord in His\ngoodness had not taught me another and a shorter road.\n8. Though, in the matter of desires, I always had generous ones;\nbut I laboured, as I said before, [5] to make my prayer, and, at\nthe same time, to live at my ease.  If there had been any one to\nrouse me to a higher flight, he might have brought me, so I\nthink, to a state in which these desires might have had their\neffects; but, for our sins, so few and so rare are they whose\ndiscretion in that matter is not excessive.  That, I believe, is\nreason enough why those who begin do not attain more quickly to\ngreat perfection; for our Lord never fails us, and it is not His\nfault; the fault and the wretchedness of this being all our own.\n9. We may also imitate the Saints by striving after solitude and\nsilence, and many other virtues that will not kill these wretched\nbodies of ours, which insist on being treated so orderly, that\nthey may disorder the soul; and Satan, too, helps much to make\nthem unmanageable.  When he sees us a little anxious about them,\nhe wants nothing more to convince us that our way of life must\nkill us, and destroy our health; even if we weep, he makes us\nafraid of blindness.  I have passed through this, and therefore I\nknow it; but I know of no better sight or better health that we\ncan desire, than the loss of both in such a cause. Being myself\nso sickly, I was always under constraint, and good for nothing,\ntill I resolved to make no account of my body nor of my health;\neven now I am worthless enough.\n10. But when it pleased God to let me find out this device of\nSatan, I used to say to the latter, when he suggested to me that\nI was ruining my health, that my death was of no consequence;\nwhen he suggested rest, I replied that I did not want rest, but\nthe Cross.  His other suggestions I treated in the same way.\nI saw clearly that in most things, though I was really very\nsickly, it was either a temptation of Satan, or a weakness on my\npart. My health has been much better since I have ceased to look\nafter my ease and comforts.  It is of great importance not to let\nour own thoughts frighten us in the beginning, when we set\nourselves to pray.  Believe me in this, for I know it by\nexperience.  As a warning to others, it may be that this story of\nmy failures may be useful.\n11. There is another temptation, which is very common: when\npeople begin to have pleasure in the rest and the fruit of\nprayer, they will have everybody else be very spiritual also.\nNow, to desire this is not wrong, but to try to bring it about\nmay not be right, except with great discretion and with much\nreserve, without any appearance of teaching.  He who would do any\ngood in this matter ought to be endowed with solid virtues, that\nhe may not put temptation in the way of others.  It happened to\nme--that is how I know it--when, as I said before, [6] I made\nothers apply themselves to prayer, to be a source of temptation\nand disorder; for, on the one hand, they heard me say great\nthings of the blessedness of prayer, and, on the other, saw how\npoor I was in virtue, notwithstanding my prayer.  They had good\nreasons on their side, and afterwards they told me of it; for\nthey knew not how these things could be compatible one with the\nother.  This it was that made them not to regard that as evil\nwhich was really so in itself, namely, that they saw me do it\nmyself, now and then, during the time that they thought well of\nme in some measure.\n12. This is Satan's work: he seems to take advantage of the\nvirtues we may have, for the purpose of giving a sanction, so far\nas he can, to the evil he aims at; how slight soever that evil\nmay be, his gain must be great, if it prevail in a religious\nhouse.  How much, then, must his gain have been, when the evil I\ndid was so very great!  And thus, during many years, only three\npersons were the better for what I said to them; but now that our\nLord has made me stronger in virtue, in the course of two or\nthree years many persons have profited, as I shall\nshow hereafter. [7]\n13. There is another great inconvenience in addition to this: the\nloss to our own soul; for the utmost we have to do in the\nbeginning is to take care of our own soul only, and consider that\nin the whole world there is only God and our soul.  This is a\npoint of great importance.\n14. There is another temptation--we ought to be aware of it, and\nbe cautious in our conduct: persons are carried away by a zeal\nfor virtue, through the pain which the sight of the sins and\nfailings of others occasions them.  Satan tells them that this\npain arises only out of their desire that God may not be\noffended, and out of their anxiety about His honour; so they\nimmediately seek to remedy the evil.  This so disturbs them, that\nthey cannot pray.  The greatest evil of all is their thinking\nthis an act of virtue, of perfection, and of a great zeal for\nGod.  I am not speaking of the pain which public sins occasion,\nif they be habitual in any community, nor of wrongs done to the\nChurch, nor of heresies by which so many souls are visibly lost;\nfor this pain is most wholesome, and being wholesome is no source\nof disquiet.  The security, therefore, of that soul which would\napply itself to prayer lies in casting away from itself all\nanxiety about persons and things, in taking care of itself, and\nin pleasing God.  This is the most profitable course.\n15. If I were to speak of the mistakes which I have seen people\nmake, in reliance on their own good intentions, I should never\ncome to an end.  Let us labour, therefore, always to consider the\nvirtues and the good qualities which we discern in others, and\nwith our own great sins cover our eyes, so that we may see none\nof their failings.  This is one way of doing our work; and though\nwe may not be perfect in it at once, we shall acquire one great\nvirtue--we shall look upon all men as better than ourselves; and\nwe begin to acquire that virtue in this way, by the grace of God,\nwhich is necessary in all things--for when we have it not, all\nour endeavours are in vain--and by imploring Him to give us this\nvirtue; for He never fails us, if we do what we can.\n16. This advice, also, they must take into their consideration\nwho make much use of their understanding, eliciting from one\nsubject many thoughts and conceptions.  As to those who, like\nmyself, cannot do it, I have no advice to give, except that they\nare to have patience, until our Lord shall send them both matter\nand light; for they can do so little of themselves, that their\nunderstanding is a hindrance to them rather than a help.\n17. To those, then, who can make use of their understanding, I\nsay that they are not to spend the whole time in that way; for\nthough it be most meritorious, yet they must not, when prayer is\nsweet, suppose that there never will be a Sunday or a time when\nno work ought to be done.  They think it lost time to do\notherwise; but I think that loss their greatest gain.  Let them\nrather, as I have said, [8] place themselves in the presence of\nChrist, and, without fatiguing the understanding, converse with\nHim, and in Him rejoice, without wearying themselves in searching\nout reasons; but let them rather lay their necessities before\nHim, and the just reasons there are why He should not suffer us\nin His presence: at one time this, at another time that, lest the\nsoul should be wearied by always eating of the same food.  These\nmeats are most savoury and wholesome, if the palate be accustomed\nto them; they will furnish a great support for the life of the\nsoul, and they have many other advantages also.\n18. I will explain myself further; for the doctrine of prayer is\ndifficult, and, without a director, very hard to understand.\nThough I would willingly be concise, and though a mere hint is\nenough for his clear intellect who has commanded me to write on\nthe subject of prayer, yet so it is, my dulness does not allow me\nto say or explain in a few words that which it is so important to\nexplain well.  I, who have gone through so much, am sorry for\nthose who begin only with books; for there is a strange\ndifference between that which we learn by reading, and that which\nwe learn by experience.\n19. Going back, then, to what I was saying.  We set ourselves to\nmeditate upon some mystery of the Passion: let us say, our Lord\nat the pillar.  The understanding goeth about seeking for the\nsources out of which came the great dolours and the bitter\nanguish which His Majesty endured in that desolation.\nIt considers that mystery in many lights, which the intellect, if\nit be skilled in its work, or furnished with learning, may there\nobtain.  This is a method of prayer which should be to everyone\nthe beginning, the middle, and the end: a most excellent and safe\nway, until our Lord shall guide them to other supernatural ways.\n20. I say to all, because there are many souls who make greater\nprogress by meditation on other subjects than on the Sacred\nPassion; for as there are many mansions in heaven, so there are\nalso many roads leading thither.  Some persons advance by\nconsidering themselves in hell, others in heaven--and these are\ndistressed by meditations on hell.  Others meditate on death;\nsome persons, if tender-hearted, are greatly fatigued by\ncontinual meditations on the Passion; but are consoled and make\nprogress when they meditate on the power and greatness of God in\nHis creatures, and on His love visible in all things.  This is an\nadmirable method--not omitting, however, from time to time, the\nPassion and Life of Christ, the Source of all good that ever\ncame, and that ever shall come.\n21. He who begins is in need of instruction, whereby he may\nascertain what profits him most.  For this end it is very\nnecessary he should have a director, who ought to be a person of\nexperience; for if he be not, he will make many mistakes, and\ndirect a soul without understanding its ways, or suffering it to\nunderstand them itself; for such a soul, knowing that obedience\nto a director is highly meritorious, dares not transgress the\ncommandments it receives.  I have met with souls cramped and\ntormented, because he who directed them had no experience: that\nmade me sorry for them.  Some of them knew not what to do with\nthemselves; for directors who do not understand the spirit of\ntheir penitents afflict them soul and body, and hinder\ntheir progress. [9]\n22. One person I had to do with had been kept by her director for\neight years, as it were, in prison; he would not allow her to\nquit the subject of self-knowledge; and yet our Lord had already\nraised her to the prayer of quiet; so she had much to suffer.\n23. Although this matter of self-knowledge must never be put\naside--for there is no soul so great a giant on this road but has\nfrequent need to turn back, and be again an infant at the breast;\nand this must never be forgotten.  I shall repeat it, [10]\nperhaps, many times, because of its great importance--for among\nall the states of prayer, however high they may be, there is not\none in which it is not often necessary to go back to the\nbeginning.  The knowledge of our sins, and of our own selves, is\nthe bread which we have to eat with all the meats, however\ndelicate they may be, in the way of prayer; without this bread,\nlife cannot be sustained, though it must be taken by measure.\nWhen a soul beholds itself resigned, and clearly understands that\nthere is no goodness in it--when it feels itself abashed in the\npresence of so great a King, and sees how little it pays of the\ngreat debt it owes Him--why should it be necessary for it to\nwaste its time on this subject?  Why should it not rather proceed\nto other matters which our Lord places before it, and for\nneglecting which there is no reason?  His Majesty surely knows\nbetter than we do what kind of food is proper for us.\n24. So, then, it is of great consequence that the director should\nbe prudent--I mean, of sound understanding--and a man of\nexperience.  If, in addition to this, he is a learned man, it is\na very great matter.  But if these three qualities cannot be had\ntogether, the first two are the most important, because learned\nmen may be found with whom we can communicate when it is\nnecessary.  I mean, that for beginners learned men are of little\nuse, if they are not men of prayer.  I do not say that they are\nto have nothing to do with learned men, because a spirituality,\nthe foundations of which are not resting on the truth, I would\nrather were not accompanied with prayer.  Learning is a great\nthing, for it teaches us who know so little, and enlightens us;\nso when we have come to the knowledge of the truths contained in\nthe holy writings, we do what we ought to do.  From silly\ndevotions, God deliver us!\n25. I will explain myself further, for I am meddling, I believe,\nwith too many matters.  It has always been my failing that I\ncould never make myself understood--as I said before [11]--but at\nthe cost of many words.  A nun begins to practise prayer; if her\ndirector be silly, and if he should take it into his head, he\nwill make her feel that it is better for her to obey him than her\nown superior.  He will do all this without any evil purpose,\nthinking that he is doing right.  For if he be not a religious\nhimself, he will think this right enough.  If his penitent be a\nmarried woman, he will tell her that it is better for her to give\nherself unto prayer, when she ought to attend to her house,\nalthough she may thereby displease her husband.  And so it is, he\nknows not how to make arrangements for time and business, so that\neverything may be done as it ought to be done; he has no light\nhimself, and can therefore give none to others, however much he\nmay wish to do so.\n26. Though learning does not seem necessary for discretion, my\nopinion has always been, and will be, that every Christian should\ncontinue to be guided by a learned director if he can, and the\nmore learned the better.  They who walk in the way of prayer have\nthe greater need of learning; and the more spiritual they are the\ngreater is that need.  Let them not say that learned men not\ngiven to prayer are not fit counsellors for those who pray: that\nis a delusion.  I have conversed with many; and now for some\nyears I have sought them the more, because of my greater need of\nthem.  I have always been fond of them; for though some of them\nhave no experience, they do not dislike spirituality, neither are\nthey ignorant of what it is, because in the sacred writings with\nwhich they are familiar they always find the truth about\nspirituality.  I am certain myself that a person given to prayer,\nwho treats of these matters with learned men, unless he is\ndeceived with his own consent, will never be carried away by any\nillusions of the devil.  I believe that the evil spirits are\nexceedingly afraid of learned men who are humble and virtuous,\nknowing that they will be found out and defeated by them.\n27. I have said this because there are opinions held to the\neffect that learned men, if they are not spiritual, are not\nsuited for persons given to prayer.  I have just said that a\nspiritual director is necessary; but if he be not a learned man,\nhe is a great hindrance.  It will help us much if we consult\nthose who are learned, provided they be virtuous; even if they be\nnot spiritual, they will be of service to me, and God will enable\nthem to understand what they should teach; He will even make them\nspiritual, in order that they may help us on.  I do not say this\nwithout having had experience of it; and I have met with more\nthan two.\n28. I say, then, that a person who shall resign his soul to be\nwholly subject to one director will make a great mistake, if he\nis in religion, unless he finds a director of this kind, because\nof the obedience due to his own superior.  His director may be\ndeficient in the three requisites I speak of, [12] and that will\nbe no slight cross, without voluntarily subjecting the\nunderstanding to one whose understanding is none of the best.\nAt least, I have never been able to bring myself to do it,\nneither does it seem to me to be right.\n29. But if he be a person living in the world, let him praise God\nfor the power he has of choosing whom he will obey, and let him\nnot lose so excellent a liberty; yea, rather let him be without a\ndirector till he finds him--for our Lord will give him one, if he\nis really humble, and has a desire to meet with the right person.\nI praise God greatly--we women, and those who are unlearned,\nought always to render Him unceasing thanks--because there are\npersons who, by labours so great, have attained to the truth, of\nwhich we unlearned people are ignorant. I often wonder at learned\nmen--particularly those who are in religion--when I think of the\ntrouble they have had in acquiring that which they communicate to\nme for my good, and that without any more trouble to me than the\nasking for it.  And yet there are people who will not take\nadvantage of their learning: God grant it may not be so!\n30. I see them undergo the poverty of the religious life, which\nis great, together with its penances, its meagre food, the yoke\nof obedience, which makes me ashamed of myself at times; and with\nall this, interrupted sleep, trials everywhere, everywhere the\nCross.  I think it would be a great evil for any one to lose so\ngreat a good by his own fault.  It may be some of us, who are\nexempted from these burdens--who have our food put into our\nmouths, as they say, and live at our ease--may think, because we\ngive ourselves a little more to prayer, that we are raised above\nthe necessity of such great hardships.  Blessed be Thou, O Lord,\nwho hast made me so incapable and so useless; but I bless Thee\nstill more for this--that Thou quickenest so many to quicken us.\nOur prayer must therefore be very earnest for those who give us\nlight.  What should we be without them in the midst of these\nviolent storms which now disturb the Church?  If some have\nfallen, the good will shine more and more. [13]  May it please\nour Lord to hold them in His hand, and help them, that they may\nhelp us.\n31. I have gone far away from the subject I began to speak of;\nbut all is to the purpose for those who are beginners, that they\nmay begin a journey which is so high in such a way as that they\nshall go on by the right road.  Coming back, then, to what I\nspoke of before, [14] the meditation on Christ bound to the\npillar, it is well we should make reflections for a time, and\nconsider the sufferings He there endured, for whom He endured\nthem, who He is who endured them, and the love with which He bore\nthem.  But a person should not always fatigue himself in making\nthese reflections, but rather let him remain there with Christ,\nin the silence of the understanding.\n32. If he is able, let him employ himself in looking upon Christ,\nwho is looking upon him; let him accompany Him, and make his\npetitions to Him; let him humble himself, and delight himself in\nChrist, and keep in mind that he never deserved to be there.\nWhen he shall be able to do this, though it may be in the\nbeginning of his prayer, he will find great advantage; and this\nway of prayer brings great advantages with it--at least, so my\nsoul has found it.  I do not know whether I am describing it\naright; you, my father, will see to it.  May our Lord grant me to\nplease Him rightly for ever!  Amen.\n1. Ch. xi. \u00a7 24.\n2.

Having spoken of the toilsome efforts and of the strength\nrequired for watering the garden when we have to draw the water\nout of the well, let us now speak of the second manner of drawing\nthe water, which the Lord of the vineyard has ordained; of the\nmachine of wheel and buckets whereby the gardener may draw more\nwater with less labour, and be able to take some rest without\nbeing continually at work.  This, then, is what I am now going to\ndescribe; and I apply it to the prayer called the prayer\nof quiet.\n2. Herein the soul begins to be recollected; it is now touching\non the supernatural--for it never could by any efforts of its own\nattain to this.  True, it seems at times to have been wearied at\nthe wheel, labouring with the understanding, and filling the\nbuckets; but in this second degree the water is higher, and\naccordingly the labour is much less than it was when the water\nhad to be drawn up out of the well; I mean, that the water is\nnearer to it, for grace reveals itself more distinctly to\nthe soul.\n3. This is a gathering together of the faculties of the soul\nwithin itself, in order that it may have the fruition of that\ncontentment in greater sweetness; but the faculties are not lost,\nneither are they asleep: the will alone is occupied in such a way\nthat, without knowing how it has become a captive, it gives a\nsimple consent to become the prisoner of God; for it knows well\nwhat is to be the captive of Him it loves.  O my Jesus and my\nLord, how pressing now is Thy love! [1]  It binds our love in\nbonds so straitly, that it is not in its power at this moment to\nlove anything else but Thee.\n4. The other two faculties help the will, that it may render\nitself capable of the fruition of so great a good; nevertheless,\nit occasionally happens, even when the will is in union, that\nthey hinder it very much: but then it should never heed them at\nall, simply abiding in its fruition and quiet. [2]  For if it\ntried to make them recollected, it would miss its way together\nwith them, because they are at this time like doves which are not\nsatisfied with the food the master of the dovecot gives them\nwithout any labouring for it on their part, and which go forth in\nquest of it elsewhere, and so hardly find it that they come back.\nAnd so the memory and the understanding come and go, seeking\nwhether the will is going to give them that into the fruition of\nwhich it has entered itself.\n5. If it be our Lord's pleasure to throw them any food, they\nstop; if not, they go again to seek it.  They must be thinking\nthat they are of some service to the will; and now and then the\nmemory or the imagination, seeking to represent to it that of\nwhich it has the fruition, does it harm.  The will, therefore,\nshould be careful to deal with them as I shall explain.\nEverything that takes place now in this state brings the very\ngreatest consolation; and the labour is so slight, that prayer,\neven if persevered in for some time, is never wearisome.\nThe reason is, that the understanding is now working very gently,\nand is drawing very much more water than it drew out of the well.\nThe tears, which God now sends, flow with joy; though we feel\nthem, they are not the result of any efforts of our own.\n6. This water of grand blessings and graces, which our Lord now\nsupplies, makes the virtues thrive much more, beyond all\ncomparison, than they did in the previous state of prayer; for\nthe soul is already ascending out of its wretched state, and some\nlittle knowledge of the blissfulness of glory is communicated to\nit.  This, I believe, is it that makes the virtues grow the more,\nand also to draw nearer to essential virtue, God Himself, from\nWhom all virtues proceed; for His Majesty has begun to\ncommunicate Himself to this soul, and will have it feel how He is\ncommunicating Himself.\n7. As soon as the soul has arrived thus far, it begins to lose\nthe desire of earthly things, [3] and no wonder; for it sees\nclearly that, even for a moment, this joy is not to be had on\nearth; that there are no riches, no dominion, no honours, no\ndelights, that can for one instant, even for the twinkling of an\neye, minister such a joy; for it is a true satisfaction, and the\nsoul sees that it really does satisfy.  Now, we who are on earth,\nas it seems to me, scarcely ever understand wherein our\nsatisfaction lies, for it is always liable to disappointment; but\nin this, at that time, there is none: the disappointment cometh\nafterwards, when the soul sees that all is over, and that it has\nno power to recover it, neither does it know how; for if it cut\nitself in pieces by penance and prayer, and every other kind of\nausterities, all would be of little use, if our Lord did not\ngrant it.  God, in His great mercy, will have the soul comprehend\nthat His Majesty is so near to it, that it need not send\nmessengers to Him, but may speak to Him itself, and not with a\nloud crying, because so near is He already, that He understands\neven the movements of its lips.\n8. It seems absurd to say this, seeing that we know that God\nunderstands us always, and is present with us.  It is so, and\nthere can be no doubt of it; but our Emperor and Lord will have\nus now understand that He understands us; and also have us\nunderstand what His presence bringeth about, and that He means in\na special way to begin a work in the soul, which is manifested in\nthe great joy, inward and outward, which He communicates, and in\nthe difference there is, as I said just now, between this joy and\ndelight and all the joys of earth; for He seems to be filling up\nthe void in our souls occasioned by our sins.\n9. This satisfaction lies in the innermost part of the soul, and\nthe soul knows not whence, nor how, it came, very often it knows\nnot what to do, or wish, or pray for.  It seems to find all this\nat once, and knoweth not what it hath found; nor do I know how to\nexplain it, because learning is necessary for many things.  Here,\nindeed, learning would be very much to the purpose, in order to\nexplain the general and particular helps of grace; for there are\nmany who know nothing about them.  Learning would serve to show\nhow our Lord now will have the soul to see, as it were, with the\nnaked eye, as men speak, this particular help of grace, and be\nalso useful in many other ways wherein I am likely to go astray.\nBut as what I write is to be seen by those who have the learning\nto discover whether I make mistakes or not, I go on without\nanxiety; for I know I need have none whatever about either the\nletter or the spirit, because it is in their power to whom it is\nto be sent to do with it as they will: they will understand it,\nand blot out whatever may be amiss.\n10. I should like them to explain this, because it is a principal\npoint, and because a soul, when our Lord begins to bestow these\ngraces upon it, does not understand them, and does not know what\nto do with itself; for if God leads it by the way of fear, as He\nled me, its trial will be heavy, if there be no one who\nunderstands the state it is in; and to see itself as in a picture\nis a great comfort; and then it sees clearly that it is\ntravelling on that road.  The knowledge of what it has to do is a\ngreat blessing for it, so that it may advance forwards in every\none of these degrees of prayer; for I have suffered greatly, and\nlost much time, because I did not know what to do; and I am very\nsorry for those souls who find themselves alone when they come to\nthis state; for though I read many spiritual books, wherein this\nvery matter is discussed, they threw very little light upon it.\nAnd if it be not a soul much exercised in prayer, it will find it\nenough to understand its state, be the books ever so clear.\n11. I wish much that our Lord would help me to describe the\neffects on the soul of these things, now that they begin to be\nsupernatural, so that men might know by these effects whether\nthey come from the Spirit of God.  I mean, known as things are\nknown here below--though it is always well to live in fear, and\non our guard; for even if they do come from God, now and then the\ndevil will be able to transform himself into an angel of\nlight; [4] and the soul, if not experienced herein, will not\nunderstand the matter; and it must have so much experience for\nthe understanding thereof, that it is necessary it should have\nattained to the highest perfection of prayer.\n12. The little time I have helps me but little, and it is\ntherefore necessary His Majesty should undertake it Himself; for\nI have to live in community, and have very many things to employ\nme, as I am in a house which is newly founded--as will appear\nhereafter; [5] and so I am writing, with very many interruptions,\nby little and little at a time.  I wish I had leisure; for when\nour Lord gives the spirit, it is more easily and better done; it\nis then as with a person working embroidery with the pattern\nbefore her; but if the spirit be wanting, there is no more\nmeaning in the words than in gibberish, so to speak, though many\nyears may have been spent in prayer.  And thus I think it a very\ngreat advantage to be in this state of prayer when I am writing\nthis; for I see clearly that it is not I who speak, nor is it I\nwho with her understanding has arranged it; and afterwards I do\nnot know how I came to speak so accurately. [6]  It has often\nhappened to me thus.\n13. Let us now return to our orchard, or flower-garden, and\nbehold now how the trees begin to fill with sap for the bringing\nforth of the blossoms, and then of the fruit--the flowers and the\nplants, also, their fragrance.  This illustration pleases me; for\nvery often, when I was beginning--and our Lord grant that I have\nreally begun to serve His Majesty--I mean, begun in relation to\nwhat I have to say of my life,--it was to me a great joy to\nconsider my soul as a garden, and our Lord as walking in it.\nI used to beseech Him to increase the fragrance of the little\nflowers of virtues--which were beginning, as it seemed to\nbud--and preserve them, that they might be to His glory; for I\ndesired nothing for myself.  I prayed Him to cut those He liked,\nbecause I already knew that they would grow the better.\n14. I say cut; for there are times in which the soul has no\nrecollection of this garden--everything seems parched, and there\nis no water to be had for preserving it--and in which it seems as\nif the soul had never possessed any virtue at all.  This is the\nseason of heavy trials; for our Lord will have the poor gardener\nsuppose all the trouble he took in maintaining and watering the\ngarden to have been taken to no purpose.  Then is the time really\nfor weeding and rooting out every plant, however small it may be,\nthat is worthless, in the knowledge that no efforts of ours are\nsufficient, if God withholds from us the waters of His grace; and\nin despising ourselves as being nothing, and even less than\nnothing.  In this way we gain great humility--the flowers\ngrow afresh.\n15. O my Lord and my Good!  I cannot utter these words without\ntears, and rejoicing in my soul; for Thou wilt be thus with us,\nand art with us, in the Sacrament.  We may believe so most truly;\nfor so it is, and the comparison I make is a great truth; and, if\nour sins stand not in the way, we may rejoice in Thee, because\nThou rejoicest in us; for Thou hast told us that Thy delight is\nto be with the children of men. [7]  O my Lord, what does it\nmean?  Whenever I hear these words, they always give me great\nconsolation, and did so even when I was most wicked.\n16. Is it possible, 0 Lord, that there can be a soul which, after\nattaining to this state wherein Thou bestowest upon it the like\ngraces and consolations, and wherein it understands that Thou\ndelightest to be with it, can yet fall back and offend Thee after\nso many favours, and such great demonstrations of the love Thou\nbearest it, and of which there cannot be any doubt, because the\neffect of it is so visible?  Such a soul there certainly is; for\nI have done so, not once, but often.  May it please Thy goodness,\nO Lord, that I may be alone in my ingratitude--the only one who\nhas committed so great an iniquity, and whose ingratitude has\nbeen so immeasurable!  But even out of my ingratitude Thine\ninfinite goodness has brought forth some good; and the greater my\nwickedness, the greater the splendour of the great mercy of Thy\ncompassions.  Oh, what reasons have I to magnify them for ever!\n17. May it be so, I beseech Thee, O my God, and may I sing of\nthem for ever, now that Thou hast been pleased to show mercies so\ngreat unto me that they who see them are astonished, mercies\nwhich draw me out of myself continually, that I may praise Thee\nmore and more! for, remaining in myself, without Thee, I could do\nnothing, O my Lord, but be as the withered flowers of the garden;\nso that this miserable earth of mine becomes a heap of refuse, as\nit was before.  Let it not be so, O Lord!--let not a soul which\nThou hast purchased with so many labours be lost, one which Thou\nhast so often ransomed anew, and delivered from between the teeth\nof the hideous dragon!\n18. You, my father, must forgive me for wandering from the\nsubject; and, as I am speaking to the purpose I have in view, you\nmust not be surprised.  What I write is what my soul has\nunderstood; and it is very often hard enough to abstain from the\npraises of God when, in the course of writing, the great debt I\nowe Him presents itself before me.  Nor do I think that it can be\ndisagreeable to you; because both of us, I believe, may sing the\nsame song, though in a different way; for my debt is much the\ngreater, seeing that God has forgiven me more, as you, my\nfather, know.\n1. 2 Cor. v. 14: \"Charitas enim Christi urget nos.\"\n2. See ch. xvii. \u00a7 12; Way of Perfection, ch. liii., but xxxi. of\nthe old editions.\n3. See Relation, i. \u00a7 12.\n4. 2 Cor. xi. 14: \"Ipse enim Satanas transfigurat se in\nangelum lucis.\"\n5. See ch. x. \u00a7 11.  As that passage refers probably to the\nmonastery of the Incarnation, this must refer to that of\nSt. Joseph, newly founded in Avila; for that of the Incarnation\nwas founded a short time before the Saint was born; and she could\nhardly say of it, now that she was at least in her forty-seventh\nyear, that it was newly founded.  The house, however, was poor;\nfor she says, ch. xxxii. \u00a7 12, that the nuns occasionally quitted\nthe monastery for a time, because of its\u00a0poverty.\n6. See ch. xviii. \u00a7 10.  In the second Report of the Rota,\np. 477--quoted by Benedict XIV., De Canoniz. iii. 26, n. 12, and\nby the Bollandists in the Acta, 1315--we have these words, and\nthey throw great light on the text: \"Sunt et alli testes de visu\naffirmantes quod quando beata Teresa scribebat libros, facies\nejus resplendebat.\"  In the information taken in Granada, the\nMother Anne of the Incarnation says she saw the Saint one night,\nwhile writing the Fortress of the Soul, with her face shining;\nand Mary of St. Francis deposes to the same effect in the\ninformations taken in Medina (De la Fuente,\nvol. ii. pp. 389,\u00a0392).\n7. Prov. viii. 31: \"Delici\u00e6 me\u00e6 esse cum filiis hominum.\"\nChapter XV.\nInstructions for Those Who Have Attained to the Prayer of Quiet.\nMany Advance So Far, but Few Go Farther.\n1. Let us now go back to the subject.  This quiet and\nrecollection of the soul makes itself in great measure felt in\nthe satisfaction and peace, attended with very great joy and\nrepose of the faculties, and most sweet delight, wherein the soul\nis established. [1]  It thinks, because it has not gone beyond\nit, that there is nothing further to wish for, but that its abode\nmight be there, and it would willingly say so with St. Peter. [2]\nIt dares not move nor stir, because it thinks that this blessing\nit has received must then escape out of its hands; now and then,\nit could wish it did not even breathe. [3]  The poor little soul\nis not aware that, as of itself it could do nothing to draw down\nthis blessing on itself, it is still less able to retain it a\nmoment longer than our Lord wills it should remain.\n2. I have already said that, in the prior recollection and\nquiet, [4] there is no failure of the powers of the soul; but the\nsoul is so satisfied in God that, although two of its powers be\ndistracted, yet, while the recollection lasts, as the will abides\nin union with God, so its peace and quiet are not disturbed; on\nthe contrary, the will by degrees brings the understanding and\nthe memory back again; for though the will is not yet altogether\nabsorbed, it continues still occupied without knowing how, so\nthat, notwithstanding all the efforts of the memory and the\nunderstanding, they cannot rob it of its delight and\njoy [5]--yea, rather, it helps without any labour at all to keep\nthis little spark of the love of God from being quenched.\n3. Oh, that His Majesty would be gracious unto me, and enable me\nto give a clear account of the matter; for many are the souls who\nattain to this state, and few are they who go farther: and I know\nnot who is in fault; most certainly it is not God; for when His\nMajesty shows mercy unto a soul, so that it advances so far, I\nbelieve that He will not fail to be more merciful still, if there\nbe no shortcomings on our part.\n4. And it is of great importance for the soul that has advanced\nso far as this to understand the great dignity of its state, the\ngreat grace given it by our Lord, and how in all reason it should\nnot belong to earth; because He, of His goodness, seems to make\nit here a denizen of heaven, unless it be itself in fault.\nAnd miserable will that soul be if it turns back; it will go\ndown, I think so, even to the abyss, as I was going myself, if\nthe mercy of our Lord had not brought me back; because, for the\nmost part, it must be the effect of grave faults--that is my\nopinion: nor is it possible to forsake so great a good otherwise\nthan through the blindness occasioned by much evil.\n5. Therefore, for the love of our Lord, I implore those souls to\nwhom His Majesty has given so great a grace--the attainment of\nthis state--to know and make much of themselves, with a humble\nand holy presumption, in order that they may never return to the\nflesh-pots of Egypt.  And if through weakness and wickedness, and\na mean and wretched nature, they should fall, as I did, let them\nalways keep in mind the good they have lost; let them suspect and\nfear--they have reason to do so--that, if they do not resume\ntheir prayer, they may go on from bad to worse.  I call that a\nreal fall which makes us hate the way by which so great a good\nwas obtained.  I address myself to those souls; but I am not\nsaying that they will never offend God, nor fall into\nsin,--though there are good reasons why those who have received\nthese graces should keep themselves carefully from sin; but we\nare miserable creatures.  What I earnestly advise is this: let\nthere be no giving up of prayer; it is by prayer they will\nunderstand what they are doing, and obtain from our Lord the\ngrace to repent, and strength to rise again; they must believe\nand believe again that, if they cease from praying, they run--so\nI think--into danger.  I know not if I understand what I am\nsaying; for, as I said before, I measure others by myself. [6]\n6. The prayer of quiet, then, is a little spark of the true love\nof Himself, which our Lord begins to enkindle in the soul; and\nHis will is, that the soul should understand what this love is by\nthe joy it brings.  This quiet and recollection and little spark,\nif it is the work of the Spirit of God, and not a sweetness\nsupplied by Satan, or brought about by ourselves, produces great\nresults.  A person of experience, however, cannot possibly fail\nto understand at once that it is not a thing that can be\nacquired, were it not that our nature is so greedy of sweetness,\nthat it seeks for it in every way.  But it becomes cold very\nsoon; for, however much we try to make the fire burn, in order to\nobtain this sweetness, it does not appear that we do anything\nelse but throw water on it, to put it out.  This spark, then,\ngiven of God, however slight it may be, causes a great crackling;\nand if men do not quench it by their faults, it is the beginning\nof the great fire, which sends forth--I shall speak of it in the\nproper place [7]--the flames of that most vehement love of God\nwhich His Majesty will have perfect souls to possess.\n7. This little spark is a sign or pledge which God gives to a\nsoul, in token of His having chosen it for great things, if it\nwill prepare to receive them.  It is a great gift, much too great\nfor me to be able to speak of it.  It is a great sorrow to me;\nbecause, as I said before, [8] I know that many souls come thus\nfar, and that those who go farther, as they ought to go, are so\nfew, that I am ashamed to say it.  I do not mean that they are\nabsolutely few: there must be many, because God is patient with\nus, for some reasons; I speak of what I have seen.\n8. I should like much to recommend these souls to take care that\nthey do not hide their talent; for it may be that God has chosen\nthem to be the edification of many others, especially in these\ndays, when the friends of God should be strong, in order that\nthey may support the weak.  Those who discern in themselves this\ngrace, must look upon themselves as such friends, if they would\nfulfil the law which even the honourable friendship of the world\nrespects; if not, as I said just now, [9] let them fear and\ntremble, lest they should be doing mischief to themselves--and\nGod grant it be to themselves only!\n9. What the soul has to do at those seasons wherein it is raised\nto the prayer of quiet is nothing more than to be gentle and\nwithout noise.  By noise, I mean going about with the\nunderstanding in search of words and reflections whereby to give\nGod thanks for this grace, and heaping up its sins and\nimperfections together to show that it does not deserve it.\nAll this commotion takes place now, and the understanding comes\nforward, and the memory is restless, and certainly to me these\npowers bring much weariness at times; for, though my memory is\nnot strong, I cannot control it.  Let the will quietly and wisely\nunderstand that it is not by dint of labour on our part that we\ncan converse to any good purpose with God, and that our own\nefforts are only great logs of wood, laid on without discretion\nto quench this little spark; and let it confess this, and in\nhumility say, O Lord, what can I do here? what has the servant to\ndo with her Lord, and earth with heaven? or words of love that\nsuggest themselves now, firmly grounded in the conviction that\nwhat it says is truth; and let it make no account of the\nunderstanding, which is simply tiresome.\n10. And if the will wishes to communicate to the understanding\nany portion of that the fruition of which itself has entered on,\nor if it labours to make the understanding recollected, it shall\nnot succeed; for it will often happen that the will is in union\nand at rest, while the understanding is in extreme disorder.\nIt is better for it to leave it alone, and not to run after it--I\nam speaking of the will; for the will should abide in the\nfruition of that grace, recollected itself, like the prudent bee;\nfor if no bees entered the hive, and each of them wandered abroad\nin search of the rest, the honey would hardly be made.  In the\nsame way, the soul will lose much if it be not careful now,\nespecially if the understanding be acute; for when it begins to\nmake reflections and search for reasons, it will think at once\nthat it is doing something if its reasons and reflections\nare good.\n11. The only reason that ought to be admitted now is to\nunderstand clearly that there is no reason whatever, except His\nmere goodness, why God should grant us so great a grace, and to\nbe aware that we are so near Him, and to pray to His Majesty for\nmercies, to make intercession for the Church, for those who had\nbeen recommended to us, and for the souls in purgatory,--not,\nhowever, with noise of words, but with a heartfelt desire to be\nheard.  This is a prayer that contains much, and by it more is\nobtained than by many reflections of the understanding.  Let the\nwill stir up some of those reasons, which proceed from reason\nitself, to quicken its love, such as the fact of its being in a\nbetter state, and let it make certain acts of love, as what it\nwill do for Him to whom it owes so much,--and that, as I said\njust now, without any noise of the understanding, in the search\nafter profound reflections.  A little straw,--and it will be less\nthan straw, if we bring it ourselves,--laid on with humility,\nwill be more effectual here, and will help to kindle a fire more\nthan many fagots of most learned reasons, which, in my opinion,\nwill put it out in a moment.\n12. This is good for those learned men who have commanded me to\nwrite, [10] and who all, by the goodness of God, have come to\nthis state; for it may be that they spend the time in making\napplications of passages of the Scriptures.  And though learning\ncould not fail to be of great use to them, both before and after\nprayer, still, in the very time of prayer itself, there is little\nnecessity for it, in my opinion, unless it be for the purpose of\nmaking the will tepid; for the understanding then, because of its\nnearness to the light, is itself illuminated; so that even I, who\nam what I am, seem to be a different person.  And so it is; for\nit has happened to me, who scarcely understand a word of what I\nread in Latin, and specially in the Psalms, when in the prayer of\nquiet, not only to understand the Latin as if it were Spanish,\nbut, still more, to take a delight in dwelling on the meaning of\nthat I knew through the Spanish.  We must make an exception: if\nthese learned men have to preach or to teach, they will do well\nto take advantage of their learning, that they may help poor\npeople of little learning, of whom I am one.  Charity is a great\nthing; and so always is ministering unto souls, when done simply\nfor God.\n13. So, then, when the soul is in the prayer of quiet, let it\nrepose in its rest--let learning be put on one side.  The time\nwill come when they may make use of it in the service of our\nLord--when they that possess it will appreciate it so highly as\nto be glad that they had not neglected it even for all the\ntreasures of the world, simply because it enables them to serve\nHis Majesty; for it is a great help.  But in the eyes of Infinite\nWisdom, believe me, a little striving after humility, and a\nsingle act thereof, are worth more than all the science in the\nworld.  This is not the time for discussing, but for\nunderstanding plainly what we are, and presenting ourselves in\nsimplicity before God, who will have the soul make itself as a\nfool--as, indeed, it is--in His presence, seeing that His Majesty\nso humbles Himself as to suffer it to be near Him, we being what\nwe are.\n14. Moreover, the understanding bestirs itself to make its\nthanksgiving in phrases well arranged; but the will, in peace,\nnot daring to lift up its eyes with the publican, [11] makes\nperhaps a better act of thanksgiving than the understanding, with\nall the tropes of its rhetoric.  In a word, mental prayer is not\nto be abandoned altogether now, nor even vocal prayer, if at any\ntime we wish, or can, to make use of either of them; for if the\nstate of quiet be profound, it becomes difficult to speak, and it\ncan be done only with great pain.\n15. I believe myself that we know whether this proceeds from the\nSpirit of God, or is brought about by endeavours of our own, in\nthe commencement of devotion which God gives; and we seek of\nourselves, as I said before, [12] to pass onwards to this quiet\nof the will.  Then, no effect whatever is produced; it is quickly\nover, and aridity is the result.  If it comes from Satan, the\npractised soul, in my opinion, will detect it, because it leaves\ntrouble behind, and scant humility and poor dispositions for\nthose effects which are wrought if it comes from God; it leaves\nneither light in the understanding nor steadiness in\nthe truth. [13]\n16. Here Satan can do little or no harm, if the soul directs unto\nGod the joy and sweetness it then feels; and if it fixes the\nthoughts and desires on Him, according to the advice already\ngiven, the devil can gain nothing whatever--on the contrary, by\nthe permission of God, he will lose much by that very joy which\nhe causes in the soul, because that joy will help the soul,\ninasmuch as it thinks the joy comes from God, to betake itself\noften to prayer in its desire for it.  And if the soul is humble,\nindifferent to, and detached from, all joy, however spiritual,\nand if it loves the cross, it will make no account of the\nsweetness which Satan sends.  But it cannot so deal with that\nwhich comes from the Spirit of God; of that it will make much.\nNow, when Satan sends it, as he is nothing but a lie, and when he\nsees that the soul humbles itself through that joy and\nsweetness--and here, in all things relating to prayer and\nsweetness, we must be very careful to endeavour to make ourselves\nhumble,--Satan will not often repeat his work, when he sees that\nhe loses by it.\n17. For this and for many other reasons, when I was speaking of\nthe first degree of prayer, and of the first method of drawing\nthe water, [14] I insisted upon it that the great affair of souls\nis, when they begin to pray, to begin also to detach themselves\nfrom every kind of joy, and to enter on it resolved only on\nhelping to carry the cross of Christ like good soldiers, willing\nto serve their King without present pay, because they are sure of\nit at last, having their eyes directed to the true and\neverlasting kingdom at the conquest of which we are aiming.\n18. It is a very great matter to have this always before our\neyes, especially in the beginning; afterwards, it becomes so\nclear, that it is rather a matter of necessity to forget it, in\norder to live on.  Now, labouring to keep in mind that all things\nhere below are of short duration, that they are all nothing, that\nthe rest we have here is to be accounted as none,--all this, I\nsay, seems to be exceedingly low; and so, indeed, it is,--because\nthose who have gone on to greater perfection would look upon it\nas a reproach, and be ashamed of themselves, if they thought that\nthey were giving up the goods of this world because they are\nperishable, or that they would not be glad to give them up for\nGod--even if they were to last for ever.  The greater the\nperfection of these persons, the greater their joy, and the\ngreater also would that joy be if the duration of these worldly\ngoods were greater.\n19. In these persons, thus far advanced, love is already grown,\nand love is that which does this work.  But as to beginners, to\nthem it is of the utmost importance, and they must not regard\nthis consideration as unbecoming, for the blessings to be gained\nare great,--and that is why I recommend it so much to them; for\nthey will have need of it--even those who have attained to great\nheights of prayer--at certain times, when God will try them, and\nwhen His Majesty seems to have forsaken them.\n20. I have said as much already, and I would not have it\nforgotten, [15] in this our life on earth, the growth of the soul\nis not like that of the body.  We, however, so speak of it--and,\nin truth, it does grow.  A youth that is grown up, whose body is\nformed, and who is become a man, does not ungrow, nor does his\nbody lessen in size; but as to the soul, it so is by our Lord's\nwill, so far as I have seen it in my own experience,--but I know\nnothing of it in any other way.  It must be in order to humble us\nfor our greater good, and to keep us from being careless during\nour exile; seeing that he who has ascended the higher has the\nmore reason to be afraid, and to be less confident in himself.\nA time may come when they whose will is so wrapt up in the will\nof God--and who, rather than fall into a single imperfection,\nwould undergo torture and suffer a thousand deaths--will find it\nnecessary, if they would be delivered from offending God, and\nfrom the commission of sin, to make use of the first armour of\nprayer, to call to mind how everything is coming to an end, that\nthere is a heaven and a hell, and to make use of other\nreflections of that nature, when they find themselves assailed by\ntemptations and persecutions.\n21. Let us go back to what I was saying.  The great source of our\ndeliverance from the cunning devices and the sweetness which\nSatan sends is to begin with a resolution to walk in the way of\nthe Cross from the very first, and not to desire any sweetness at\nall, seeing that our Lord Himself has pointed out to us the way\nof perfection, saying, \"Take up thy cross and follow Me.\" [16]\nHe is our example; and whosoever follows His counsels only to\nplease Him has nothing to fear.  In the improvement which they\ndetect in themselves, they who do so will see that this is no\nwork of Satan and if they fall, they have a sign of the presence\nof our Lord in their rising again at once.  They have other\nsigns, also, of which I am going to speak.\n22. When it is the work of the Spirit of God, there is no\nnecessity for going about searching for reasons, on the strength\nof which we may elicit acts of humility and of shame, because our\nLord Himself supplies them in a way very different from that by\nwhich we could acquire them by our own poor reflections, which\nare as nothing in comparison with that real humility arising out\nof the light which our Lord here gives us, and which begets a\nconfusion of face that undoes us.  The knowledge with which God\nsupplies us, in order that we may know that of ourselves we have\nno good in us, is perfectly apprehended--and the more perfectly,\nthe greater the graces.  It fills us with a great desire of\nadvancing in prayer, and of never giving it up, whatever troubles\nmay arise.  The soul offers to suffer everything.  A certain\nsecurity, joined with humility and fear concerning our salvation,\ncasts out servile fear at once from the soul, and in its place\nplants a loyal fear [17] of more perfect growth. [18]  There is a\nvisible beginning of a love of God, utterly divested of all\nself-interest, together with a longing after seasons of solitude,\nin order to obtain a greater fruition of this good.\n23. In short, not to weary myself, it is the beginning of all\ngood; the flowers have so thriven, that they are on the point of\nbudding.  And this the soul sees most clearly, and it is\nimpossible to persuade it now that God was not with it, till it\nturns back upon itself, and beholds its own failings and\nimperfections.  Then it fears for everything; and it is well it\nshould do so--though there are souls whom the certain conviction\nthat God is with them benefits more than all the fear they may\never have.  If a soul love greatly, and is thankful naturally,\nthe remembrance of the mercies of God makes it turn to Him more\neffectually than all the chastisements of hell it can ever\npicture to itself--at least, it was so with me, though I am\nso wicked.\n24. As I shall speak at greater length of the signs of a good\nspirit [19]--it has cost me much labour to be clear about them--I\ndo not treat of them here.  I believe, too, that, with the help\nof God, I shall be able to speak somewhat to the point,\nbecause--setting aside the experience I have had, and by which I\nlearned much--I have had the help of some most learned men and\npersons of great holiness, whom we may reasonably believe in the\nmatter. Souls, therefore, are not to weary themselves so much as\nI did, when, by the goodness of our Lord, they may have come to\nthis state.\n1.

Let us now speak of the third water wherewith this garden is\nwatered,--water running from a river or from a brook,--whereby\nthe garden is watered with very much less trouble, although there\nis some in directing the water. [1]  In this state our Lord will\nhelp the gardener, and in such a way as to be, as it were, the\nGardener Himself, doing all the work.  It is a sleep of the\npowers of the soul, which are not wholly lost, nor yet\nunderstanding how they are at work.  The pleasure, sweetness, and\ndelight are incomparably greater than in the former state of\nprayer; and the reason is, that the waters of grace have risen up\nto the neck of the soul, so that it can neither advance nor\nretreat--nor does it know how to do so; it seeks only the\nfruition of exceeding bliss.  It is like a dying man with the\ncandle in his hand, on the point of dying the death desired.\nIt is rejoicing in this agony with unutterable joy; to me it\nseems to be nothing else but a death, as it were, to all the\nthings of this world, and a fruition of God.  I know of no other\nwords whereby to describe it or to explain it; neither does the\nsoul then know what to do,--for it knows not whether to speak or\nbe silent, whether it should laugh or weep.  It is a glorious\nfolly, a heavenly madness, wherein true wisdom is acquired; and\nto the soul a kind of fruition most full of delight. [2]\n2. It is now some five or six years, I believe, since our Lord\nraised me to this state of prayer, in its fulness, and that more\nthan once,--and I never understood it, and never could explain\nit; and so I was resolved, when I should come thus far in my\nstory, to say very little or nothing at all.  I knew well enough\nthat it was not altogether the union of all the faculties, and\nyet most certainly it was higher than the previous state of\nprayer; but I confess that I could not determine and understand\nthe difference.\n3. The humility of your reverence, willing to be helped by a\nsimplicity so great as mine, has been the cause, I believe, why\nour Lord, to-day, after Communion, admitted me to this state of\nprayer, without the power of going further, and suggested to me\nthese comparisons, and taught me how to speak of it, and of what\nthe soul must do therein.  Certainly, I was amazed, and in a\nmoment understood it all.  I have often been thus, as it were,\nbeside myself, drunk with love, and yet never could understand\nhow it was.  I knew well that it was the work of God, but I never\nwas able to understand the manner of His working here; for, in\nfact, the faculties are almost all completely in union, yet not\nso absorbed that they do not act.  I have been singularly\ndelighted in that I have been able to comprehend the matter at\nlast.  Blessed be our Lord, who has thus consoled me!\n4. The faculties of the soul now retain only the power of\noccupying themselves wholly with God; not one of them ventures to\nstir, neither can we move one of them without making great\nefforts to distract ourselves--and, indeed, I do not think we can\ndo it at all at this time.  Many words are then uttered in praise\nof God--but disorderly, unless it be that our Lord orders them\nhimself.  At least, the understanding is utterly powerless here;\nthe soul longs to send forth words of praise, but it has no\ncontrol over itself,--it is in a state of sweet restlessness.\nThe flowers are already opening; they are beginning to send forth\ntheir fragrance.\n5. The soul in this state would have all men behold and know of\nits bliss, to the praise of God, and help it to praise Him.\nIt would have them to be partakers of its joy; for its joy is\ngreater than it can bear.  It seems to me that it is like the\nwoman in the Gospel, who would, or used to, call in her\nneighbours. [3]  The admirable spirit of David, the royal\nprophet, must have felt in the same way, so it seems to me, when\nhe played on the harp, singing the praises of God.  I have a very\ngreat devotion to this glorious king; [4] and I wish all had it,\nparticularly those who are sinners like myself.\n6. O my God, what must that soul be when it is in this state?\nIt wishes it were all tongue, in order that it may praise our\nLord. It utters a thousand holy follies, striving continually to\nplease Him by whom it is thus possessed.  I know one [5] who,\nthough she was no poet, yet composed, without any preparation,\ncertain stanzas, full of feeling, most expressive of her pain:\nthey were not the work of her own understanding; but, in order to\nhave a greater fruition of that bliss which so sweet a pain\noccasioned her, she complained of it in that way to God. She was\nwilling to be cut in pieces, soul and body, to show the delight\nshe felt in that pain.  To what torments could she be then\nexposed, that would not be delicious to endure for her Lord?\nShe sees clearly that the martyrs did little or nothing, so far\nas they were concerned, when they endured their tortures, because\nthe soul is well aware that its strength is derived from\nanother source.\n7. But what will be its sufferings when it returns to the use of\nthe senses, to live in the world, and go back to the anxieties\nand the fashions thereof?  I do not think that I have exaggerated\nin any way, but rather have fallen short, in speaking of that\njoy, which our Lord, of His good pleasure, gives to the soul in\nthis its exile.  Blessed for ever be Thou, O Lord! and may all\ncreated things praise Thee for ever!\n8. O my King, seeing that I am now, while writing this, still\nunder the power of this heavenly madness, an effect of Thy mercy\nand goodness,--and it is a mercy I never deserved,--grant, I\nbeseech Thee, that all those with whom I may have to converse may\nbecome mad through Thy love, or let me converse with none, or so\norder it that I may have nothing to do in the world, or take me\naway from it.  This Thy servant, O my God, is no longer able to\nendure sufferings so great as those are which she must bear when\nshe sees herself without Thee if she must live, she seeks no\nrepose in this life,--and do Thou give her none.  This my soul\nlongs to be free--eating is killing it, and sleep is wearisome;\nit sees itself wasting the time of this life in comforts, and\nthat there is no comfort for it now but in Thee; it seems to be\nliving contrary to nature--for now, it desires to live not in\nitself, but in Thee.\n9. O my true Lord and my happiness! what a cross hast Thou\nprepared for those who attain to this state!--light and most\nheavy at the same time: light, because sweet; heavy, because now\nand then there is no patience left to endure it--and yet the soul\nnever wishes to be delivered from it, unless it be that it may\ncome to Thee.  When the soul remembers that it has never served\nThee at all, and that by living on it may do Thee some service,\nit longs for a still heavier cross, and never to die before the\nend of the world.  Its own repose it counts as nothing in\ncomparison with doing a slight service to Thee.  It knows not\nwhat to desire; but it clearly understands that it desires\nnothing else but Thee.\n10. O my son, [6] so humble is he to whom this writing is\ndirected, and who has commanded me to write, that he suffers\nhimself to be thus addressed,--you, my father, only must see\nthese things, in which I seem to have transgressed all bounds;\nfor no reason can keep me reasonable when our Lord draws me out\nof myself.  Since my communion this morning, [7] I do not believe\nthat I am the person who is speaking; I seem to be dreaming the\nthings I see, and I wish I might never see any but people ill, as\nI am now.  I beseech you, my father, let us all be mad, for the\nlove of Him who for our sakes suffered men to say of Him that He\nwas mad. [8]\n11. You, my father, say that you wish me well.  I wish you would\nprove it by disposing yourself so that God may bestow this grace\nupon you; for I see very few people who have not too much sense\nfor everything they have to do: and it may be that I have more\nthan anybody else.  Your reverence must not allow it; you are my\nfather, for you are my confessor, and the person to whom I have\ntrusted my soul; disperse my delusions by telling the truth; for\ntruths of this sort are very rarely told.\n12. I wish we five, who now love one another in our Lord, had\nmade some such arrangement as this: as others in these times have\nmet together in secret [9] to plot wickedness and heresies\nagainst His Majesty, so we might contrive to meet together now\nand then, in order to undeceive one another, to tell each other\nwherein we might improve ourselves, and be more pleasing unto\nGod; for there is no one that knows himself as well as he is\nknown of others who see him, if it be with eyes of love and the\nwish to do him good. I say; in secret; for language of this kind\nis no longer in use; even preachers go about arranging their\nsermons so as to displease no one. [10]  They have a good\nintention, and their work is good; yet still few amend their\nlives.  But how is it that they are not many who, in consequence\nof these sermons, abstain from public sins?  Well, I think it is\nbecause the preachers are highly sensible men.  They are not\nburning with the great fire of the love of God, as the Apostles\nwere, casting worldly prudence aside; and so their fire throws\nout but little heat.  I do not say that their fire ought to burn\nlike that of the Apostles, but I do wish it were a stronger fire\nthan I see it is.  Do you, my father, know wherein much of this\nfire consists?  In the hatred of this life, in the desertion of\nits honours, in being utterly indifferent whether we lose or gain\nanything or everything, provided the truth be told and maintained\nfor the glory of God; for he who is courageously in earnest for\nGod, looks upon loss or gain indifferently.  I do not say that I\nam a person of this kind, but I wish I was.\n13. Oh, grand freedom, to regard it as a captivity to be obliged\nto live and converse with men according to the laws of the world!\nIt is the gift of our Lord; there is not a slave who would not\nimperil everything that he might escape and return to his\ncountry; and as this is the true road, there is no reason why we\nshould linger; for we shall never effectually gain a treasure so\ngreat, so long as this life is not ended.  May our Lord give us\nHis grace for that end!  You, my father, if it shall seem good to\nyou, will tear up what I have written, and consider it as a\nletter for yourself alone, and forgive me that I have been\nvery bold.\n1. \"The third degree, or third water, of the Saint, must begin, I\nthink, with the prayer of infused recollection, include that of\ninfused quiet, and end in that of inebriation; because it is not\nin our power to draw this water--all we can do is to direct the\nstream.\" (Francis. de St. Thoma, Medulla Mystica,\ntr. iv. ch. xii. p.\u00a0208).\n2.

Father Ba\u00f1es wrote here on the margin of the Saint's MS,\n\"Legant pr\u00e6dicatores\" (De la\u00a0Fuente).\nChapter XVII.\nThe Third State of Prayer.  The Effects Thereof.  The Hindrance\nCaused by the Imagination and the Memory.\n1. Enough has been said of this manner of prayer, and of what the\nsoul has to do, or rather, to speak more correctly, of what God\nis doing within it; for it is He who now takes upon Himself the\ngardener's work, and who will have the soul take its ease; except\nthat the will is consenting to the graces, the fruition of which\nit has, and that it must resign itself to all that the True\nWisdom would accomplish in it--for which it is certain it has\nneed of courage; because the joy is so great, that the soul seems\nnow and then to be on the very point of going forth out of the\nbody: and what a blessed death that would be!  Now, I think it is\nfor the soul's good--as you, my father, have been told--to\nabandon itself into the arms of God altogether; if He will take\nit to heaven, let it go; if to hell, no matter, as it is going\nthither with its sovereign Good.  If life is to come to an end\nfor ever, so it wills; if it is to last a thousand years, it\nwills that also: His Majesty may do with it as with His own\nproperty,--the soul no longer belongs to itself, it has been\ngiven wholly to our Lord; let it cast all care utterly away.\n2. My meaning is that, in a state of prayer, so high as this, the\nsoul understands that God is doing His work without any fatiguing\nof the understanding, except that, as it seems to me, it is as if\namazed in beholding our Lord taking upon Himself the work of the\ngood gardener, refusing to let the soul undergo any labour\nwhatever, but that of taking its pleasure in the flowers\nbeginning to send forth their fragrance; for when God raises a\nsoul up to this state, it can do all this, and much more,--for\nthese are the effects of it.\n3. In one of these visits, how brief soever it may be, the\nGardener, being who He is,--in a word, the Creator of the\nwater,--pours the water without stint; and what the poor soul,\nwith the labour, perhaps, of twenty years in fatiguing the\nunderstanding, could not bring about, that the heavenly Gardener\naccomplishes in an instant, causing the fruit both to grow and\nripen; so that the soul, such being the will of our Lord, may\nderive its sustenance from its garden.  But He allows it not to\ndivide the fruit with others, until by eating thereof, it is\nstrong enough not to waste it in the mere tasting of it,--giving\nto Him none of the produce, nor making any compensation for it to\nHim who supplies it,--lest it should be maintaining others,\nfeeding them at its own cost, and itself perhaps dying of\nhunger. [1]  The meaning of this is perfectly clear for those who\nhave understanding enough to apply it--much more clear than I can\nmake it; and I am tired.\n4. Finally, the virtues are now stronger than they were during\nthe preceding prayer of quiet; for the soul sees itself to be\nother than it was, and it knows not how it is beginning to do\ngreat things in the odour which the flowers send forth; it being\nour Lord's will that the flowers should open, in order that the\nsoul may believe itself to be in possession of virtue; though it\nsees most clearly that it cannot, and never could, acquire them\nin many years, and that the heavenly Gardener has given them to\nit in that instant.  Now, too, the humility of the soul is much\ngreater and deeper than it was before; because it sees more\nclearly that it did neither much nor little, beyond giving its\nconsent that our Lord might work those graces in it, and then\naccepting them willingly.\n5. This state of prayer seems to me to be a most distinct union\nof the whole soul with God, but for this, that His Majesty\nappears to give the faculties leave to be intent upon, and have\nthe fruition of, the great work He is doing then.  It happens at\ntimes, and indeed very often, that, the will being in union, the\nsoul should be aware of it, and see that the will is a captive\nand in joy, that the will alone is abiding in great\npeace,--while, on the other hand, the understanding and the\nmemory are so free, that they can be employed in affairs and be\noccupied in works of charity.  I say this, that you, my father,\nmay see it is so, and understand the matter when it shall happen\nto yourself; at least, it carried me out of myself, and that is\nthe reason why I speak of it here.\n6. It differs from the prayer of quiet, of which I have\nspoken, [2] though it does seem as if it were all one with it.\nIn that prayer, the soul, which would willingly neither stir nor\nmove, is delighting in the holy repose of Mary; but in this\nprayer it can be like Martha also. [3]  Accordingly, the soul is,\nas it were, living the active and contemplative life at once, and\nis able to apply itself to works of charity and the affairs of\nits state, and to spiritual reading.  Still, those who arrive at\nthis state, are not wholly masters of themselves, and are well\naware that the better part of the soul is elsewhere.  It is as if\nwe were speaking to one person, and another speaking to us at the\nsame time, while we ourselves are not perfectly attentive either\nto the one or the other.  It is a state that is most easily\nascertained, and one, when attained to, that ministers great joy\nand contentment, and that prepares the soul in the highest\ndegree, by observing times of solitude, or of freedom from\nbusiness, for the attainment of the most tranquil quietude.\nIt is like the life of a man who is full, requiring no food, with\nhis appetite satisfied, so that he will not eat of everything set\nbefore him, yet not so full either as to refuse to eat if he saw\nany desirable food.  So the soul has no satisfaction in the\nworld, and seeks no pleasure in it then; because it has in itself\nthat which gives it a greater satisfaction, greater joys in God,\nlongings for the satisfaction of its longing to have a deeper joy\nin being with Him--this is what the soul seeks.\n7. There is another kind of union, which, though not a perfect\nunion, is yet more so than the one of which I have just spoken;\nbut not so much so as this spoken of as the third water. You, my\nfather, will be delighted greatly if our Lord should bestow them\nall upon you, if you have them not already, to find an account of\nthe matter in writing, and to understand it; for it is one grace\nthat our Lord gives grace; and it is another grace to understand\nwhat grace and what gift it is; and it is another and further\ngrace to have the power to describe and explain it to others.\nThough it does not seem that more than the first of these--the\ngiving of the grace--is necessary to enable the soul to advance\nwithout confusion and fear, and to walk with the greater courage\nin the way of our Lord, trampling under foot all the things of\nthis world, it is a great advantage and a great grace to\nunderstand it; for every one who has it has great reason to\npraise our Lord; and so, also, has he who has it not: because His\nMajesty has bestowed it upon some person living who is to make us\nprofit by it.\n8. This union, of which I would now speak, frequently occurs,\nparticularly to myself.  God has very often bestowed such a grace\nupon me, whereby He constrains the will, and even the\nunderstanding, as it seems to me, seeing that it makes no\nreflections, but is occupied in the fruition of God: like a\nperson who looks on, and sees so many things, that he knows not\nwhere to look--one object puts another out of sight, and none of\nthem leaves any impression behind.\n9. The memory remains free, and it must be so, together with the\nimagination; and so, when it finds itself alone, it is marvellous\nto behold what war it makes on the soul, and how it labours to\nthrow everything into disorder.  As for me, I am wearied by it,\nand I hate it; and very often do I implore our Lord to deprive me\nof it on these occasions, if I am to be so much troubled by it.\nNow and then, I say to Him: O my God, when shall my soul praise\nThee without distraction, not dissipated in this way, unable to\ncontrol itself!  I understand now the mischief that sin has done,\nin that it has rendered us unable to do what we desire--to be\nalways occupied in God. [4]\n10. I say that it happens to me from time to time,--it has done\nso this very day, and so I remember it well,--to see my soul tear\nitself, in order to find itself there where the greater part of\nit is, and to see, at the same time, that it is impossible:\nbecause the memory and the imagination assail it with such force,\nthat it cannot prevail against them; yet, as the other faculties\ngive them no assistance, they are not able to do it any\nharm--none whatever; they do enough when they trouble its rest.\nWhen I say they do no harm, my meaning is, that they cannot\nreally hurt it, because they have not strength enough, and\nbecause they are too discursive.  As the understanding gives no\nhelp, neither much nor little, in the matters put before the\nsoul, they never rest anywhere, but hurry to and fro, like\nnothing else but gnats at night, troublesome and unquiet: and so\nthey go about from one subject to another.\n11. This comparison seems to me to be singularly to the purpose;\nfor the memory and the imagination, though they have no power to\ndo any harm, are very troublesome.  I know of no remedy for it;\nand, hitherto, God has told me of none.  If He had, most gladly\nwould I make use of it; for I am, as I say, tormented very often.\nThis shows our wretchedness and brings out most distinctly the\ngreat power of God, seeing that the faculty which is free hurts\nand wearies us so much; while the others, occupied with His\nMajesty, give us rest.\n12. The only remedy I have found, after many years of weariness,\nis that I spoke of when I was describing the prayer of quiet: [5]\nto make no more account of it than of a madman, but let it go\nwith its subject; for God alone can take it from it,--in short,\nit is a slave here.  We must bear patiently with it, as Jacob\nbore with Lia; for our Lord showeth us mercy enough when we are\nallowed to have Rachel with us.\n13. I say that it remains a slave; for, after all, let it do what\nit will, it cannot drag the other faculties in its train; on the\ncontrary, they, without taking any trouble, compel it to follow\nafter them.  Sometimes God is pleased to take pity on it, when He\nsees it so lost and so unquiet, through the longing it has to be\nunited with the other faculties, and His Majesty consents to its\nburning itself in the flame of that divine candle by which the\nothers are already reduced to ashes, and their nature lost,\nbeing, as it were, supernaturally in the fruition of blessings\nso great.\n14. In all these states of prayer of which I have spoken, while\nexplaining this last method of drawing the water out of the well,\nso great is the bliss and repose of the soul, that even the body\nmost distinctly shares in its joy and delight,--and this is most\nplain; and the virtues continue to grow, as I said before. [6]\nIt seems to have been the good pleasure of our Lord to explain\nthese states of prayer, wherein the soul finds itself, with the\nutmost clearness possible, I think, here on earth.\n15. Do you, my father, discuss it with any spiritual person who\nhas arrived at this state, and is learned. If  he says of it, it\nis well, you may believe that God has spoken it, and you will\ngive thanks to His Majesty; for, as I said just now, [7] in the\ncourse of time you will rejoice greatly in that you have\nunderstood it.  Meanwhile, if He does not allow you to understand\nwhat it is, though He does give you the possession of it, yet,\nwith your intellect and learning, seeing that His Majesty has\ngiven you the first, you will know what it is, by the help of\nwhat I have written here.

Attainable on Earth, Not by Our Merit, but by\nthe Goodness of Our Lord.\n1. May our Lord teach me words whereby I may in some measure\ndescribe the fourth water. [1]  I have great need of His\nhelp--even more than I had while speaking of the last; for in\nthat the soul still feels that it is not dead altogether.  We may\nthus speak, seeing that to the world it is really dead.  But, as\nI have said, [2] it retains the sense to see that it is in the\nworld, and to feel its own loneliness; and it makes use of that\nwhich is outward for the purpose of manifesting its feelings, at\nleast by signs.  In the whole of the prayer already spoken of,\nand in all the states of it, the gardener undergoes some labour:\nthough in the later states the labour is attended with so much\nbliss and comfort of the soul, that the soul would never\nwillingly pass out of it,--and thus the labour is not felt as\nlabour, but as bliss.\n2. In this the fourth state there is no sense of anything, only\nfruition, without understanding what that is the fruition of\nwhich is granted.  It is understood that the fruition is of a\ncertain good containing in itself all good together at once; but\nthis good is not comprehended.  The senses are all occupied in\nthis fruition in such a way that not one of them is at liberty,\nso as to be able to attend to anything else, whether outward\nor inward.\n3. The senses were permitted before, as I have said, [3] to give\nsome signs of the great joy they feel; but now, in this state,\nthe joy of the soul is incomparably greater, and the power of\nshowing it is still less; for there is no power in the body, and\nthe soul has none, whereby this fruition can be made known.\nEverything of that kind would be a great hindrance, a torment,\nand a disturbance of its rest.  And I say, if it really be a\nunion of all the faculties, that the soul, even if it wished,--I\nmean, when it is in union,--cannot make it known; and if it can,\nthen it is not union at all.\n4. How this, which we call union, is effected, and what it is, I\ncannot tell.  Mystical theology explains it, and I do not know\nthe terms of that science; nor can I understand what the mind is,\nnor how it differs from the soul or the spirit either: all three\nseem to me but one; though I do know that the soul sometimes\nleaps forth out of itself, like a fire that is burning and is\nbecome a flame; and occasionally this fire increases\nviolently--the flame ascends high above the fire; but it is not\ntherefore a different thing: it is still the same flame of the\nsame fire.  Your learning, my fathers, will enable you to\nunderstand the matter; I can go no further.\n5. What I undertake to explain is that which the soul feels when\nit is in the divine union.  It is plain enough what union is--two\ndistinct things becoming one.  O my Lord, how good Thou art!\nBlessed be Thou for ever, O my God!  Let all creatures praise\nThee, Who hast so loved us that we can truly speak of this\ncommunication which Thou hast with souls in this our exile!\nYea, even if they be good souls, it is on Thy part great\nmunificence and magnanimity,--in a word, it is Thy munificence, O\nmy Lord, seeing that Thou givest like Thyself.  O infinite\nMunificence!--how magnificent are Thy works!  Even he whose\nunderstanding is not occupied with the things of earth is amazed\nthat he is unable to understand these truths.  Why, then, give\ngraces so high to souls who have been such great sinners?\nTruly, this passeth my understanding; and when I come to think of\nit, I can get no further.  Is there any way at all for me to go\non which is not a going back?  For, as to giving Thee thanks for\nmercies so great, I know not how to do it.  Sometimes I relieve\nmyself by giving utterance to follies.  It often happens to me,\neither when I receive these graces, or when God is about to\nbestow them,--for, in the midst of them, I have already said, [4]\nI was able to do nothing,--that I would break out into words\nlike these.\n6. O Lord, consider what Thou art doing; forget not so soon the\ngreat evils that I have done.  To forgive me, Thou must already\nhave forgotten them; yet, in order that there may be some limit\nto Thy graces, I beseech Thee remember them.  O my Creator, pour\nnot a liquor so precious into a vessel so broken; for Thou hast\nalready seen how on other occasions I allowed it to run waste.\nLay not up treasure like this, where the longing after the\nconsolations of this life is not so mortified as it ought to be;\nfor it will be utterly lost.  How canst Thou commit the defence\nof the city, and the keys of its fortress to a commander so\ncowardly, who at the first assault will let the enemy enter\nwithin?  Oh, let not Thy love be so great, O King Eternal, as to\nimperil jewels so precious!  O my Lord, to me it seems that it\nbecomes a ground for undervaluing them, when Thou puttest them in\nthe power of one so wretched, so vile, so frail, so miserable,\nand so worthless as I am, who, though she may labour not to lose\nthem, by the help of Thy grace,--and I have need of no little\ngrace for that end, being what I am,--is not able to win over any\none to Thee,--in short, I am a woman, not good, but wicked.\nIt seems to me that the talents are not only hidden, but buried,\nwhen they are committed to earth so vile.  It is not Thy wont, O\nLord, to bestow graces and mercies like these upon a soul, unless\nit be that it may edify many.\n7. Thou, O my God, knowest already that I beg this of Thee with\nmy whole will, from the bottom of my heart, and that I have done\nso more than once, and I account it a blessing to lose the\ngreatest blessings which may be had on earth, if Thou wouldst but\nbestow these graces upon him who will make a better use of them\nto the increase of Thy glory.  These, and expressions like these,\nit has happened to me often to utter.  I saw afterwards my own\nfoolishness and want of humility; for our Lord knoweth well what\nis expedient, and that there is no strength in my soul to be\nsaved, if His Majesty did not give it with graces so great.\n8. I purpose also to speak of the graces and effects which abide\nin the soul, and of that which the soul itself can do, or rather,\nif it can do anything of itself towards attaining to a state so\nhigh.  The elevation of the spirit, or union, comes together with\nheavenly love but, as I understand it, union is a different thing\nfrom elevation in union itself.  To him who may not have had any\nexperience of the latter, it must seem that it is not; and,\naccording to my view of it, even if they are both one, the\noperations of our Lord therein are different: there is a growth\nof the soul's detachment from creatures more abundantly still in\nthe flight of the spirit. [5]  I have clearly seen that this is a\nparticular grace, though, as I say, it may be the same, or seem\nto be so, with the other; but a little fire, also, is as much\nfire as a great fire--and yet there is a visible difference\nbetween them.  Before a small piece of iron is made red-hot in a\nlittle fire, some time must pass; but if the fire be great, the\niron very quickly, though bulky, loses its nature altogether\nin appearance.\n9. So, it seems to me, is it with these two kinds of graces which\nour Lord bestows.  He who has had raptures will, I am sure,\nunderstand it well; to him who has not had that experience, it\nmust appear folly.  And, indeed, it may well be so; for if a\nperson like myself should speak of a matter of this kind, and\ngive any explanation at all of that for the description of which\nno words ever can possibly be found, it is not to be wondered at\nthat I may be speaking foolishly.\n10. But I have this confidence in our Lord, that He will help me\nhere; for His Majesty knoweth that my object in writing--the\nfirst is to obey--is to inspire souls with a longing after so\nhigh a good.  I will speak of nothing that I do not know by great\nexperience: and so, when I began to describe the last kind of\nwater, I thought it more impossible for me to speak of it at all\nthan to speak Greek.  It is a very difficult matter; so I left\nit, and went to Communion.  Blessed be our Lord, who is merciful\nto the ignorant!  Oh, virtue of obedience! it can do everything!\nGod enlightened my understanding--at one time suggesting the\nwords, at another showing me how to use them; for, as in the\npreceding state of prayer, so also now, His Majesty seems to\nutter what I can neither speak nor understand. [6]\n11. What I am saying is the simple truth; and therefore whatever\nis good herein is His teaching; what is erroneous, clearly comes\nout of that sea of evil--myself.  If there be any--and there must\nbe many--who, having attained to these states of prayer whereunto\nour Lord in His mercy has brought me--wretch that I am!--and who,\nthinking they have missed their way, desire to treat of these\nmatters with me, I am sure that our Lord will help His servant to\ndeclare the truth more plainly.\n12. I am now speaking of the water which cometh down from heaven\nto fill and saturate in its abundance the whole of this garden\nwith water.  If our Lord never ceased to pour it down whenever it\nwas necessary, the gardener certainly would have plenty of rest;\nand if there were no winter, but an ever temperate season, fruits\nand flowers would never fail.  The gardener would have his\ndelight therein; but in this life that is impossible.  We must\nalways be careful, when one water fails, to obtain another.\nThis water from heaven comes down very often when the gardener\nleast expects it.\n13. The truth is that, in the beginning, this almost always\nhappens after much mental prayer.  Our Lord advances step by step\nto lay hold of the little bird, and to lay it in the nest where\nit may repose.  He observed it fluttering for a long time,\nstriving with the understanding and the will, and with all its\nmight, to seek God and to please Him; so now it is His pleasure\nto reward it even in this life.  And what a reward!--one moment\nis enough to repay all the possible trials of this life.\n14. The soul, while thus seeking after God, is conscious, with a\njoy excessive and sweet, that it is, as it were, utterly fainting\naway in a kind of trance: breathing, and all the bodily strength,\nfail it, so that it cannot even move the hands without great\npain; the eyes close involuntarily, and if they are open, they\nare as if they saw nothing; nor is reading possible,--the very\nletters seem strange, and cannot be distinguished,--the letters,\nindeed, are visible, but, as the understanding furnishes no help,\nall reading is impracticable, though seriously attempted.\nThe ear hears; but what is heard is not comprehended.  The senses\nare of no use whatever, except to hinder the soul's fruition; and\nso they rather hurt it.  It is useless to try to speak, because\nit is not possible to conceive a word; nor, if it were conceived,\nis there strength sufficient to utter it; for all bodily strength\nvanishes, and that of the soul increases, to enable it the better\nto have the fruition of its joy.  Great and most perceptible,\nalso, is the outward joy now felt.\n15. This prayer, however long it may last, does no harm--at\nleast, it has never done any to me; nor do I remember, however\nill I might have been when our Lord had mercy upon me in this\nway, that I ever felt the worse for it--on the contrary, I was\nalways better afterwards.  But so great a blessing, what harm can\nit do?  The outward effects are so plain as to leave no doubt\npossible that there must have been some great cause, seeing that\nit thus robs us of our bodily powers with so much joy, in order\nto leave them greater.\n16. The truth is, it passes away so quickly in the beginning--at\nleast, so it was with me--that neither by the outward signs, nor\nby the failure of the senses, can it be perceived when it passes\nso quickly away.  But it is plain, from the overflowing abundance\nof grace, that the brightness of the sun which had shone there\nmust have been great, seeing that it has thus made the soul to\nmelt away.  And this is to be considered; for, as it seems to me,\nthe period of time, however long it may have been, during which\nthe faculties of the soul were entranced, is very short; if half\nan hour, that would be a long time.  I do not think that I have\never been so long. [7]  The truth of the matter is this: it is\nextremely difficult to know how long, because the senses are in\nsuspense; but I think that at any time it cannot be very long\nbefore some one of the faculties recovers itself.  It is the will\nthat persists in the work; the other two faculties quickly begin\nto molest it.  As the will is calm, it entrances them again; they\nare quiet for another moment, and then they recover themselves\nonce more.\n17. In this way, some hours may be, and are, passed in prayer;\nfor when the two faculties begin to drink deep, and to perceive\nthe taste of this divine wine, they give themselves up with great\nreadiness, in order to be the more absorbed: they follow the\nwill, and the three rejoice together.  But this state of complete\nabsorption, together with the utter rest of the imagination,--for\nI believe that even the imagination is then wholly at\nrest,--lasts only for a short time; though the faculties do not\nso completely recover themselves as not to be for some hours\nafterwards as if in disorder: God, from time to time, drawing\nthem to Himself.\n18. Let us now come to that which the soul feels interiorly.\nLet him describe it who knows it; for as it is impossible to\nunderstand it, much more is it so to describe it.  When I\npurposed to write this, I had just communicated, and had risen\nfrom the very prayer of which I am speaking.  I am thinking of\nwhat the soul was then doing.  Our Lord said to me: It undoes\nitself utterly, My daughter, in order that it may give itself\nmore and more to Me: it is not itself that then lives, it is I.\nAs it cannot comprehend what it understands, it understands by\nnot understanding. [8]\n19. He who has had experience of this will understand it in some\nmeasure, for it cannot be more clearly described, because what\nthen takes place is so obscure.  All I am able to say is, that\nthe soul is represented as being close to God; and that there\nabides a conviction thereof so certain and strong, that it cannot\npossibly help believing so.  All the faculties fail now, and are\nsuspended in such a way that, as I said before, [9] their\noperations cannot be traced.  If the soul is making a meditation\non any subject, the memory of it is lost at once, just as if it\nhad never been thought of.  If it reads, what is read is not\nremembered nor dwelt upon; neither is it otherwise with vocal\nprayer.  Accordingly, the restless little butterfly of the memory\nhas its wings burnt now, and it cannot fly.  The will must be\nfully occupied in loving, but it understands not how it loves;\nthe understanding, if it understands, does not understand how it\nunderstands--at least, it can comprehend nothing of that it\nunderstands: it does not understand, as it seems to me, because,\nas I said just now, this cannot be understood.  I do not\nunderstand it at all myself.\n20. In the beginning, it happened to me that I was ignorant of\none thing--I did not know that God was in all things: [10] and\nwhen He seemed to me to be so near, I thought it impossible.\nNot to believe that He was present, was not in my power; for it\nseemed to me, as it were, evident that I felt there His very\npresence.  Some unlearned men used to say to me, that He was\npresent only by His grace.  I could not believe that, because, as\nI am saying, He seemed to me to be present Himself: so I was\ndistressed.  A most learned man, of the Order of the glorious\nPatriarch St. Dominic, delivered me from this doubt; for he told\nme that He was present, and how He communed with us: this was a\ngreat comfort to me.\n21. It is to be observed and understood that this water from\nheaven,--this greatest grace of our Lord--always leaves in the\nsoul the greatest fruits, as I shall now show.\n1. See ch. xi. \u00a7 11.\n2.

Earnest Exhortations\nto Those Who Have Attained to It Not to Go Back, Nor to Cease\nfrom Prayer, Even if They Fall.  The Great Calamity of\nGoing Back.\n1. There remains in the soul, when the prayer of union is over,\nan exceedingly great tenderness; so much so, that it would undo\nitself--not from pain, but through tears of joy it finds itself\nbathed therein, without being aware of it, and it knows not how\nor when it wept them.  But to behold the violence of the fire\nsubdued by the water, which yet makes it burn the more, gives it\ngreat delight.  It seems as if I were speaking an unknown\nlanguage.  So it is, however.\n2. It has happened to me occasionally, when this prayer was over,\nto be so beside myself as not to know whether I had been\ndreaming, or whether the bliss I felt had really been mine; and,\non finding myself in a flood of tears--which had painlessly\nflowed, with such violence and rapidity that it seemed as if a\ncloud from heaven [1] had shed them--to perceive that it was no\ndream.  Thus it was with me in the beginning, when it passed\nquickly away.  The soul remains possessed of so much courage,\nthat if it were now hewn in pieces for God, it would be a great\nconsolation to it.  This is the time of resolutions, of heroic\ndeterminations, of the living energy of good desires, of the\nbeginning of hatred of the world, and of the most clear\nperception of its vanity.  The soul makes greater and higher\nprogress than it ever made before in the previous states of\nprayer; and grows in humility more and more, because it sees\nclearly that neither for obtaining nor for retaining this grace,\ngreat beyond all measure, has it ever done, or ever been able to\ndo, anything of itself. It looks upon itself as most\nunworthy--for in a room into which the sunlight enters strongly,\nnot a cobweb can be hid; it sees its own misery; self-conceit is\nso far away, that it seems as if it never could have had any--for\nnow its own eyes behold how very little it could ever do, or\nrather, that it never did anything, that it hardly gave even its\nown consent, but that it rather seemed as if the doors of the\nsenses were closed against its will in order that it might have\nmore abundantly the fruition of our Lord.  It is abiding alone\nwith Him: what has it to do but to love Him?  It neither sees nor\nhears, unless on compulsion: no thanks to it.  Its past life\nstands before it then, together with the great mercy of God, in\ngreat distinctness; and it is not necessary for it to go forth to\nhunt with the understanding, because what it has to eat and\nruminate upon, it sees now ready prepared.  It sees, so far as\nitself is concerned, that it has deserved hell, and that its\npunishment is bliss.  It undoes itself in the praises of God, and\nI would gladly undo myself now.\n3. Blessed be Thou, O my Lord, who, out of a pool so filthy as I\nam, bringest forth water so clean as to be meet for Thy table!\nPraised be Thou, O Joy of the Angels, who hast been thus pleased\nto exalt so vile a worm!\n4. The good effects of this prayer abide in the soul for some\ntime.  Now that it clearly apprehends that the fruit is not its\nown, the soul can begin to share it with others, and that without\nany loss to itself.  It begins to show signs of its being a soul\nthat is guarding the treasures of heaven, and to be desirous of\ncommunicating them to others, [2] and to pray to God that itself\nmay not be the only soul that is rich in them.  It begins to\nbenefit its neighbours, as it were, without being aware of it, or\ndoing anything consciously: its neighbours understand the matter,\nbecause the odour of the flowers has grown so strong as to make\nthem eager to approach them.  They understand that this soul is\nfull of virtue: they see the fruit, how delicious it is, and they\nwish to help that soul to eat it.\n5. If this ground be well dug by troubles, by persecutions,\ndetractions, and infirmities,--they are few who ascend so high\nwithout this,--if it be well broken up by great detachment from\nall self-interest, it will drink in so much water that it can\nhardly ever be parched again.  But if it be ground which is mere\nwaste, and covered with thorns (as I was when I began); if the\noccasions of sin be not avoided; if it be an ungrateful soil,\nunfitted for so great a grace,--it will be parched up again.\nIf the gardener become careless,--and if our Lord, out of His\nmere goodness, will not send down rain upon it,--the garden is\nruined. Thus has it been with me more than once, so that I am\namazed at it; and if I had not found it so by experience, I could\nnot have believed it.\n6. I write this for the comfort of souls which are weak, as I am,\nthat they may never despair, nor cease to trust in the power of\nGod; even if they should fall after our Lord has raised them to\nso high a degree of prayer as this is, they must not be\ndiscouraged, unless they would lose themselves utterly.\nTears gain everything, and one drop of water attracts another.\n7. One of the reasons that move me, who am what I am, under\nobedience to write this, and give an account of my wretched life,\nand of the graces our Lord has wrought in me,--though I never\nserved Him, but offended Him rather,--is what I have just given:\nand, certainly, I wish I was a person of great authority, that\npeople might believe what I say.  I pray to our Lord that His\nMajesty would be pleased to grant me this grace.  I repeat it,\nlet no one who has begun to give himself to prayer be\ndiscouraged, and say: If I fall into sin, it will be worse for me\nif I go on now with the practice of prayer.  I think so too, if\nhe gives up prayer, and does not correct his evil ways; but if he\ndoes not give up prayer, let him be assured of this--prayer will\nbring him to the haven of light.\n8. In this the devil turned his batteries against me, and I\nsuffered so much because I thought it showed but little humility\nif I persevered in prayer when I was so wicked, that--as I have\nalready said [3]--I gave it up for a year and a half--at least,\nfor a year, but I do not remember distinctly the other six\nmonths.  This could not have been, neither was it, anything else\nbut to throw myself down into hell; there was no need of any\ndevils to drag me thither.  O my God, was there ever blindness so\ngreat as this?  How well Satan prepares his measures for his\npurpose, when he pursues us in this way!  The traitor knows that\nhe has already lost that soul which perseveres in prayer, and\nthat every fall which he can bring about helps it, by the\ngoodness of God, to make greater progress in His service.\nSatan has some interest in this.\n9. O my Jesus, what a sight that must be--a soul so highly\nexalted falling into sin, and raised up again by Thee; who, in\nThy mercy, stretchest forth Thine hand to save!  How such a soul\nconfesses Thy greatness and compassion and its own wretchedness!\nIt really looks on itself as nothingness, and confesses Thy\npower.  It dares not lift up its eyes; it raises them, indeed,\nbut it is to acknowledge how much it oweth unto Thee.  It becomes\ndevout to the Queen of Heaven, that she may propitiate Thee; it\ninvokes the Saints, who fell after Thou hadst called them, for\nsuccour.  Thou seemest now to be too bountiful in Thy gifts,\nbecause it feels itself to be unworthy of the earth it treads on.\nIt has recourse to the Sacraments, to a quickened faith, which\nabides in it at the contemplation of the power which Thou hast\nlodged in them.  It praises Thee because Thou hast left us such\nmedicines and ointment for our wounds, which not only heal them\non the surface, but remove all traces whatever of them.\n10. The soul is amazed at it.  Who is there, O Lord of my soul,\nthat is not amazed at compassion so great and mercy so\nsurpassing, after treason so foul and so hateful?  I know not how\nit is that my heart does not break when I write this, for I am\nwicked.  With these scanty tears which I am now weeping, but yet\nThy gift,--water out of a well, so far as it is mine, so\nimpure,--I seem to make Thee some recompense for treachery so\ngreat as mine, in that I was always doing evil, labouring to make\nvoid the graces Thou hast given me.  Do Thou, O Lord, make my\ntears available; purify the water which is so muddy; at least,\nlet me not be to others a temptation to rash judgments, as I have\nbeen to myself, when I used to think such thoughts as these.\nWhy, O Lord, dost Thou pass by most holy persons, who have always\nserved Thee, and who have been tried; who have been brought up in\nreligion, and are really religious--not such as I am, having only\nthe name--so as to make it plain that they are not recipients of\nthose graces which Thou hast bestowed upon me?\n11. I see clearly now, O Thou my Good, Thou hast kept the reward\nto give it them all at once: my weakness has need of these\nsuccours.  They, being strong, serve Thee without them, and Thou\ndealest with them as with a strong race, free from all\nself-interest.  But yet Thou knowest, O my Lord, that I have\noften cried unto Thee, making excuses for those who murmured\nagainst me; for I thought they had reason on their side.  This I\ndid then when Thou of Thy goodness hadst kept me back from\noffending Thee so much, and when I was departing from everything\nwhich I thought displeasing unto Thee.  It was when I did this\nthat Thou, O Lord, didst begin to lay open Thy treasures for Thy\nservant.  It seemed as if Thou wert looking for nothing else but\nthat I should be willing and ready to receive them; accordingly,\nThou didst begin at once, not only to give them, but also to make\nothers know that Thou wert giving them.\n12. When this was known, there began to prevail a good opinion of\nher, of whom all had not yet clearly understood how wicked she\nwas, though much of that wickedness was plain enough. Calumny and\npersecution began at once, and, as I think, with good reason; so\nI looked on none of them as an enemy, but made my supplications\nto Thee, imploring Thee to consider the grounds they had.\nThey said that I wished to be a saint, and that I invented\nnovelties; but I had not then attained in many things even to the\nobservance of my rule; nor had I come near those excellent and\nholy nuns who were in the house,--and I do not believe I ever\nshall, if God of His goodness will not do that for me Himself; on\nthe contrary, I was there only to do away with what was good, and\nintroduce customs which were not good; at least, I did what I\ncould to bring them in, and I was very powerful for evil.\nThus it was that they were blameless, when they blamed me.  I do\nnot mean the nuns only, but the others as well: they told me\ntruths; for it was Thy will.\n13. I was once saying the Office,--I had had this temptation for\nsome time,--and when I came to these words, \"Justus es, Domine,\net rectum judicium tuum,\" [4] I began to think what a deep truth\nit was.  Satan never was strong enough to tempt me in any way to\ndoubt of Thy goodness, or of any article of the faith: on the\ncontrary, it seems to me that the more these truths were above\nnature, the more firmly I held them, and my devotion grew; when I\nthought of Thy omnipotence, I accepted all Thy wonderful works,\nand I say it again, I never had a doubt.  Then, as I was thinking\nhow it could be just in Thee to allow so many, who, as I said,\nare Thy most faithful servants, to remain without those\nconsolations and graces which Thou hast given to me, who am what\nI am, Thou, O my Lord, didst answer me: Serve thou Me, and meddle\nnot with this.\n14. This was the first word which I ever heard Thee speak to me,\nand it made me greatly afraid.  But as I shall speak\nhereafter [5] of this way of hearing, and of other matters, I say\nnothing here; for to do so would be to digress from my subject,\nand I have already made digressions enough.  I scarcely know what\nI have said, nor can it be otherwise; but you, my father, must\nbear with these interruptions; for when I consider what God must\nhave borne with from me, and when I see the state I am in, it is\nnot strange that I should wander in what I am saying, and what I\nhave still to say.\n15. May it please our Lord that my wanderings may be of this\nkind, and may His Majesty never suffer me to have strength to\nresist Him even in the least; yea, rather than that, may He\ndestroy me this moment.  It is evidence enough of His great\ncompassions, that He has forgiven so much ingratitude, not once,\nbut often.  He forgave St. Peter once; but I have been forgiven\nmany times.  Satan had good reasons for tempting me: I ought\nnever to have pretended to a strict friendship with One, my\nhatred of whom I made so public.  Was there ever blindness so\ngreat as mine?  Where could I think I should find help but in\nThee?  What folly to run away from the light, to be for ever\nstumbling!  What a proud humility was that which Satan devised\nfor me, when I ceased to lean upon the pillar, and threw the\nstaff away which supported me, in order that my fall might not\nbe great! [6]\n16. I make the sign of the cross this moment.  I do not think I\never escaped so great a danger as this device of Satan, which he\nwould have imposed upon me in the disguise of humility. [7]\nHe filled me with such thoughts as these: How could I make my\nprayer, who was so wicked, and yet had received so many mercies?\nIt was enough for me to recite the Office, as all others did; but\nas I did not that much well, how could I desire to do more?\nI was not reverential enough, and made too little of the mercies\nof God.  There was no harm in these thoughts and feelings in\nthemselves; but to act upon them, that was an exceedingly great\nwickedness.  Blessed be Thou, O Lord; for Thou camest to my help.\nThis seems to me to be in principle the temptation of Judas, only\nthat Satan did not dare to tempt me so openly.  But he might have\nled me by little and little, as he led Judas, to the same pit\nof destruction.\n17. Let all those who give themselves to prayer, for the love of\nGod, look well to this.  They should know that when I was\nneglecting it, my life was much worse than it had ever been; let\nthem reflect on the excellent help and the pleasant humility\nwhich Satan provided for me: it was a grave interior disquietude.\nBut how could my spirit be quiet?  It was going away in its\nmisery from its true rest.  I remembered the graces and mercies I\nhad received, and felt that the joys of this world were\nloathsome.  I am astonished that I was able to bear it.  It must\nhave been the hope I had; for, as well as I can remember now, it\nis more than twenty-one years ago.  I do not think I ever gave up\nmy purpose of resuming my prayer; but I was waiting to be very\nfree from sin first.\n18. Oh, how deluded I was in this expectation!  The devil would\nhave held it out before me till the day of judgment, that he\nmight then take me with him to hell.  Then, when I applied myself\nto prayer and to spiritual reading,--whereby I might perceive\nthese truths, and the evil nature of the way I was walking in,\nand was often importunate with our Lord in tears,--I was so\nwicked, that it availed me nothing; when I gave that up, and\nwasted my time in amusing myself, in great danger of falling into\nsin, and with scanty helps,--and I may venture to say no help at\nall, unless it was a help to my ruin,--what could I expect but\nthat of which I have spoken?\n19. I believe that a certain Dominican friar, a most learned man,\nhas greatly merited in the eyes of God; for it was he who roused\nme from this slumber.  He made me--I think I said so\nbefore [8]--go to Communion once a fortnight, and be less given\nto evil; I began to be converted, though I did not cease to\noffend our Lord all at once: however, as I had not lost my way, I\nwalked on in it, though slowly, falling and rising again; and he\nwho does not cease to walk and press onwards, arrives at last,\neven if late.  To lose one's way is--so it seems to me--nothing\nelse but the giving up of prayer.  God, of His mercy, keeps us\nfrom this!\n20. It is clear from this,--and, for the love of God, consider it\nwell,--that a soul, though it may receive great graces from God\nin prayer, must never rely on itself, because it may fall, nor\nexpose itself in any way whatever to any risks of sin.  This\nshould be well considered because much depends on it; for the\ndelusion here, wherein Satan is able to entangle us afterwards,\nthough the grace be really from God, lies in the traitor's making\nuse of that very grace, so far as he can, for his own purpose,\nand particularly against persons not grown strong in virtues, who\nare neither mortified nor detached; for these are not at present\nstrong enough--as I shall explain hereafter [9]--to expose\nthemselves to dangerous occasions, notwithstanding the noble\ndesires and resolutions they may have.\n21. This doctrine is excellent, and not mine, but the teaching of\nGod, and accordingly I wish ignorant people like myself knew it;\nfor even if a soul were in this state, it must not rely so much\nupon itself as to go forth to the battle, because it will have\nenough to do in defending itself.  Defensive armour is the\npresent necessity; the soul is not yet strong enough to assail\nSatan, and to trample him under foot, as those are who are in the\nstate of which I shall speak further on. [10]\n22. This is the delusion by which Satan prevails: when a soul\nsees itself so near unto God, when it sees the difference there\nis between the things of heaven and those of earth, and when it\nsees the love which our Lord bears it, there grows out of that\nlove a certain trust and confidence that there is to be no\nfalling away from that the fruition of which it then possesses.\nIt seems to see the reward distinctly, as if it were impossible\nfor it to abandon that which, even in this life, is so delicious\nand sweet, for anything so mean and impure as worldly joy.\nThrough this confidence, Satan robs it of that distrust which it\nought to have in itself; and so, as I have just said, [11] the\nsoul exposes itself to dangers, and begins, in the fulness of its\nzeal, to give away without discretion the fruit of its garden,\nthinking that now it has no reason to be afraid for itself.\nYet this does not come out of pride; for the soul clearly\nunderstands that of itself it can do no good thing; but rather\nout of an excessive confidence in God, without discretion:\nbecause the soul does not see itself to be unfledged.  It can go\nforth out of its nest, and God Himself may take it out, but still\nit cannot fly, because the virtues are not strong, and itself has\nno experience wherewith to discern the dangers; nor is it aware\nof the evil which trusting to itself may do it.\n23. This it was that ruined me.  Now, to understand this, and\neverything else in the spiritual life, we have great need of a\ndirector, and of conference with spiritual persons.  I fully\nbelieve, with respect to that soul which God raises to this\nstate, that He will not cease to be gracious to it, nor suffer it\nto be lost, if it does not utterly forsake His Majesty.  But when\nthat soul--as I said--falls, let it look to it again and again,\nfor the love of our Lord, that Satan deceive it not by tempting\nit to give up prayer, as he tempted me, through that false\nhumility of which I have spoken before, [12] and would gladly\nspeak of again and again.  Let it rely on the goodness of God,\nwhich is greater than all the evil we can do.  When we,\nacknowledging our own vileness, desire to return into His grace,\nHe remembers our ingratitude no more,--no, not even the graces He\nhas given us, for the purpose of chastising us, because of our\nmisuse of them; yea, rather, they help to procure our pardon the\nsooner, as of persons who have been members of His household, and\nwho, as they say, have eaten of His bread.\n24. Let them remember His words, and behold what He hath done\nunto me, who grew weary of sinning before He grew weary of\nforgiving.  He is never weary of giving, nor can His compassion\nbe exhausted.  Let us not grow weary ourselves of receiving.\nMay He be blessed for ever, Amen; and may all created things\npraise Him!\n1. See ch. xx. \u00a7 2.\n2. See ch. xvii. \u00a7 3.\n3.

What Rapture Is.\nThe Blessing It Is to the Soul.  The Effects of It.\n1. I wish I could explain, with the help of God, wherein union\ndiffers from rapture, or from transport, or from flight of the\nspirit, as they speak, or from a trance, which are all one. [1]\nI mean, that all these are only different names for that one and\nthe same thing, which is also called ecstasy. [2]  It is more\nexcellent than union, the fruits of it are much greater, and its\nother operations more manifold; for union is uniform in the\nbeginning, the middle, and the end, and is so also interiorly.\nBut as raptures have ends of a much higher kind, they produce\neffects both within and without. [3]  As our Lord has explained\nthe other matters, so also may He explain this; for certainly, if\nHe had not shown me in what way and by what means this\nexplanation was in some measure possible, I should never have\nbeen able to do it.\n2. Consider we now that this last water, of which I am speaking,\nis so abundant that, were it not that the ground refuses to\nreceive it, we might suppose that the cloud of His great Majesty\nis here raining down upon us on earth.  And when we are giving\nHim thanks for this great mercy, drawing near to Him in earnest,\nwith all our might, then it is our Lord draws up the soul, as the\nclouds, so to speak, gather the mists from the face of the earth,\nand carries it away out of itself,--I have heard it said that the\nclouds, or the sun, draw the mists together, [4]--and as a cloud,\nrising up to heaven, takes the soul with Him, and begins to show\nit the treasures of the kingdom which He has prepared for it.\nI know not whether the comparison be accurate or not; but the\nfact is, that is the way in which it is brought about.\nDuring rapture, the soul does not seem to animate the body, the\nnatural heat of which is perceptibly lessened; the coldness\nincreases, though accompanied with exceeding joy\nand sweetness. [5]\n3. A rapture is absolutely irresistible; whilst union, inasmuch\nas we are then on our own ground, may be hindered, though that\nresistance be painful and violent; it is, however, almost always\nimpossible.  But rapture, for the most part, is irresistible.\nIt comes, in general, as a shock, quick and sharp, before you can\ncollect your thoughts, or help yourself in any way, and you see\nand feel it as a cloud, or a strong eagle rising upwards, and\ncarrying you away on its wings.\n4. I repeat it: you feel and see yourself carried away, you know\nnot whither.  For though we feel how delicious it is, yet the\nweakness of our nature makes us afraid at first, and we require a\nmuch more resolute and courageous spirit than in the previous\nstates, in order to risk everything, come what may, and to\nabandon ourselves into the hands of God, and go willingly whither\nwe are carried, seeing that we must be carried away, however\npainful it may be; and so trying is it, that I would very often\nresist, and exert all my strength, particularly at those times\nwhen the rapture was coming on me in public.  I did so, too, very\noften when I was alone, because I was afraid of delusions.\nOccasionally I was able, by great efforts, to make a slight\nresistance; but afterwards I was worn out, like a person who had\nbeen contending with a strong giant; at other times it was\nimpossible to resist at all: my soul was carried away, and almost\nalways my head with it,--I had no power over it,--and now and\nthen the whole body as well, so that it was lifted up from\nthe ground.\n5. This has not happened to me often: once, however, it took\nplace when we were all together in choir, and I, on my knees, on\nthe point of communicating.  It was a very sore distress to me;\nfor I thought it a most extraordinary thing, and was afraid it\nwould occasion much talk; so I commanded the nuns--for it\nhappened after I was made Prioress--never to speak of it.  But at\nother times, the moment I felt that our Lord was about to repeat\nthe act, and once, in particular, during a sermon,--it was the\nfeast of our house, some great ladies being present,--I threw\nmyself on the ground; then the nuns came around me to hold me;\nbut still the rapture was observed.\n6. I made many supplications to our Lord, that He would be\npleased to give me no more of those graces which were outwardly\nvisible; for I was weary of living under such great restraint,\nand because His Majesty could not bestow such graces on me\nwithout their becoming known.  It seems that, of His goodness, He\nhas been pleased to hear my prayer; for I have never been\nenraptured since.  It is true that it was not long ago. [6]\n7. It seemed to me, when I tried to make some resistance, as if a\ngreat force beneath my feet lifted me up.  I know of nothing with\nwhich to compare it; but it was much more violent than the other\nspiritual visitations, and I was therefore as one ground to\npieces; for it is a great struggle, and, in short, of little use,\nwhenever our Lord so wills it.  There is no power against\nHis power.\n8. At other times He is pleased to be satisfied when He makes us\nsee that He is ready to give us this grace, and that it is not He\nthat withholds it.  Then, when we resist it out of humility, He\nproduces those very effects which would have resulted if we had\nfully consented to it.\n9. The effects of rapture are great: one is that the mighty power\nof our Lord is manifested; and as we are not strong enough, when\nHis Majesty wills it, to control either soul or body, so neither\nhave we any power over it; but, whether we like it or not, we see\nthat there is one mightier than we are, that these graces are His\ngifts, and that of ourselves we can do nothing whatever; and\nhumility is deeply imprinted in us.  And further, I confess that\nit threw me into great fear, very great indeed at first; for when\nI saw my body thus lifted up from the earth, how could I help it?\nThough the spirit draws it upwards after itself, and that with\ngreat sweetness, if unresisted, the senses are not lost; at\nleast, I was so much myself as to be able to see that I was being\nlifted up.  The majesty of Him who can effect this so manifests\nitself, that the hairs of my head stand upright, [7] and a great\nfear comes upon me of offending God, who is so mighty.  This fear\nis bound up in exceedingly great love, which is acquired anew,\nand directed to Him, who, we see, bears so great a love to a worm\nso vile, and who seems not to be satisfied with attracting the\nsoul to Himself in so real a way, but who will have the body\nalso, though it be mortal and of earth so foul, such as it is\nthrough our sins, which are so great.\n10. Rapture leaves behind a certain strange detachment also,\nwhich I shall never be able to describe; I think I can say that\nit is in some respects different from--yea, higher than--the\nother graces, which are simply spiritual; for though these effect\na complete detachment in spirit from all things, it seems that in\nthis of rapture our Lord would have the body itself to be\ndetached also: and thus a certain singular estrangement from the\nthings of earth is wrought, which makes life much more\ndistressing.  Afterwards it causes a pain, which we can never\ninflict of ourselves, nor remove when once it has come.\n11. I should like very much to explain this great pain, and I\nbelieve I shall not be able; however, I will say something if I\ncan.  And it is to be observed that this is my present state, and\none to which I have been brought very lately, after all the\nvisions and revelations of which I shall speak, and after that\ntime, wherein I gave myself to prayer, in which our Lord gave me\nso much sweetness and delight. [8]  Even now I have that\nsweetness occasionally; but it is the pain of which I speak that\nis the most frequent and the most common.  It varies in its\nintensity.  I will now speak of it when it is sharpest; for I\nshall speak later on [9] of the great shocks I used to feel when\nour Lord would throw me into those trances, and which are, in my\nopinion, as different from this pain as the most corporeal thing\nis from the most spiritual; and I believe that I am not\nexaggerating much. For though the soul feels that pain, it is in\ncompany with the body; [10] both soul and body apparently share\nit, and it is not attended with that extremity of abandonment\nwhich belongs to this.\n12. As I said before, [11] we have no part in causing this pain;\nbut very often there springs up a desire unexpectedly,--I know\nnot how it comes,--and because of this desire, which pierces the\nsoul in a moment, the soul begins to be wearied, so much so that\nit rises upwards above itself, and above all created things. God\nthen so strips it of everything, that, do what it may, there is\nnothing on earth that can be its companion.  Neither, indeed,\nwould it wish to have any; it would rather die in that\nloneliness.  If people spoke to it, and if itself made every\neffort possible to speak, it would be of little use: the spirit,\nnotwithstanding all it may do, cannot be withdrawn from that\nloneliness; and though God seems, as it were, far away from the\nsoul at that moment, yet He reveals His grandeurs at times in the\nstrangest way conceivable.  That way is indescribable; I do not\nthink any one can believe or comprehend it who has not previously\nhad experience of it.  It is a communication made, not to\nconsole, but to show the reason why the soul must be weary;\nbecause it is far away from the Good which in itself comprehends\nall good.\n13. In this communication the desire grows, so also does the\nbitterness of that loneliness wherein the soul beholds itself,\nsuffering a pain so sharp and piercing that, in that very\nloneliness in which it dwells, it may literally say of\nitself,--and perhaps the royal prophet said so, being in that\nvery loneliness himself, except that our Lord may have granted to\nhim, being a saint, to feel it more deeply,--\"Vigilavi, et factus\nsum sicut passer solitarius in tecto.\" [12]  These words\npresented themselves to me in such a way that I thought I saw\nthem fulfilled in myself.  It was a comfort to know that others\nhad felt this extreme loneliness; how much greater my comfort,\nwhen these persons were such as David was!  The soul is then--so\nI think--not in itself, but on the house-top, or on the roof,\nabove itself, and above all created things; for it seems to me to\nhave its dwelling higher than even in the highest part of itself.\n14. On other occasions, the soul seems to be, as it were, in the\nutmost extremity of need, asking itself, and saying, \"Where is\nThy God?\" [13]  And it is to be remembered, that I did not know\nhow to express in Spanish the meaning of those words.\nAfterwards, when I understood what it was, I used to console\nmyself with the thought, that our Lord, without any effort of\nmine, had made me remember them.  At other times, I used to\nrecollect a saying of St. Paul's, to the effect that he was\ncrucified to the world. [14] I do not mean that this is true of\nme: I know it is not; but I think it is the state of the\nenraptured soul.  No consolation reaches it from heaven, and it\nis not there itself; it wishes for none from earth, and it is not\nthere either; but it is, as it were, crucified between heaven and\nearth, enduring its passion: receiving no succour from either.\n15. Now, the succour it receives from heaven--which, as I have\nsaid, [15] is a most marvellous knowledge of God, above all that\nwe can desire--brings with it greater pain; for the desire then\nso grows, that, in my opinion, its intense painfulness now and\nthen robs the soul of all sensation; only, it lasts but for a\nshort time after the senses are suspended.  It seems as if it\nwere the point of death; only, the agony carries with it so great\na joy, that I know of nothing wherewith to compare it.  It is a\nsharp martyrdom, full of sweetness; for if any earthly thing be\nthen offered to the soul, even though it may be that which it\nhabitually found most sweet, the soul will have none of it; yea,\nit seems to throw it away at once.  The soul sees distinctly that\nit seeks nothing but God; yet its love dwells not on any\nattribute of Him in particular; it seeks Him as He is, and knows\nnot what it seeks.  I say that it knows not, because the\nimagination forms no representation whatever; and, indeed, as I\nthink, during much of that time the faculties are at rest.\nPain suspends them then, as joy suspends them in union and in\na trance.\n16. O Jesus! oh, that some one would clearly explain this to you,\nmy father, were it only that you may tell me what it means,\nbecause this is the habitual state of my soul!  Generally, when I\nam not particularly occupied, I fall into these agonies of death,\nand I tremble when I feel them coming on, because they are not\nunto death.  But when I am in them, I then wish to spend therein\nall the rest of my life, though the pain be so very great, that I\ncan scarcely endure it.  Sometimes my pulse ceases, as it were,\nto beat at all,--so the sisters say, who sometimes approach me,\nand who now understand the matter better,--my bones are racked,\nand my hands become so rigid, that I cannot always join them.\nEven on the following day I have a pain in my wrists, and over my\nwhole body, as if my bones were out of joint. [16]  Well, I think\nsometimes, if it continues as at present, that it will end, in\nthe good pleasure of our Lord, by putting an end to my life; for\nthe pain seems to me sharp enough to cause death; only, I do not\ndeserve it.\n17. All my anxiety at these times is that I should die: I do not\nthink of purgatory, nor of the great sins I have committed, and\nby which I have deserved hell.  I forget everything in my\neagerness to see God; and this abandonment and loneliness seem\npreferable to any company in the world.  If anything can be a\nconsolation in this state, it is to speak to one who has passed\nthrough this trial, seeing that, though the soul may complain of\nit, no one seems disposed to believe in it.\n18. The soul is tormented also because the pain has increased so\nmuch, that it seeks solitude no longer, as it did before, nor\ncompanionship, unless it be that of those to whom it may make its\ncomplaint.  It is now like a person, who, having a rope around\nhis neck, and being strangled, tries to breathe. This desire of\ncompanionship seems to me to proceed from our weakness; for, as\npain brings with it the risk of death,--which it certainly does;\nfor I have been occasionally in danger of death, in my great\nsickness and infirmities, as I have said before, [17] and I think\nI may say that this pain is as great as any,--so the desire not\nto be parted, which possesses soul and body, is that which raises\nthe cry for succour in order to breathe, and by speaking of it,\nby complaining, and distracting itself, causes the soul to seek\nmeans of living very much against the will of the spirit, or the\nhigher part of the soul, which would not wish to be delivered\nfrom this pain.\n19. I am not sure that I am correct in what I say, nor do I know\nhow to express myself, but to the best of my knowledge it comes\nto pass in this way.  See, my father, what rest I can have in\nthis life, now that what I once had in prayer and\nloneliness--therein our Lord used to comfort me--has become in\ngeneral a torment of this kind; while, at the same time, it is so\nfull of sweetness, that the soul, discerning its inestimable\nworth, prefers it to all those consolations which it formerly\nhad.  It seems also to be a safer state, because it is the way of\nthe cross; and involves, in my opinion, a joy of exceeding worth,\nbecause the state of the body in it is only pain.  It is the soul\nthat suffers and exults alone in that joy and contentment which\nsuffering supplies.\n20. I know not how this can be, but so it is; it comes from the\nhand of our Lord, and, as I said before, [18] is not anything\nthat I have acquired myself, because it is exceedingly\nsupernatural, and I think I would not barter it for all the\ngraces of which I shall speak further on: I do not say for all of\nthem together, but for any one of them separately.  And it must\nnot be forgotten that, as I have just said, these impetuosities\ncame upon me after I had received those graces from our Lord [19]\nwhich I am speaking of now, and all those described in this book,\nand it is in this state our Lord keeps me at this moment. [20]\n21. In the beginning I was afraid--it happens to me to be almost\nalways so when our Lord leads me by a new way, until His Majesty\nreassures me as I proceed--and so our Lord bade me not to fear,\nbut to esteem this grace more than all the others He had given\nme; for the soul was purified by this pain--burnished, or refined\nas gold in the crucible, so that it might be the better enamelled\nwith His gifts, and the dross burnt away in this life, which\nwould have to be burnt away in purgatory.\n22. I understood perfectly that this pain was a great grace; but\nI was much more certain of it now and my confessor tells me I did\nwell.  And though I was afraid, because I was so wicked, I never\ncould believe it was anything wrong: on the other hand, the\nexceeding greatness of the blessing made me afraid, when I called\nto mind how little I had deserved it.  Blessed be our Lord, who\nis so good!  Amen.\n23. I have, it seems, wandered from my subject; for I began by\nspeaking of raptures, and that of which I have been speaking is\neven more than a rapture, and the effects of it are what I have\ndescribed.  Now let us return to raptures, and speak of their\nordinary characteristics.  I have to say that, when the rapture\nwas over, my body seemed frequently to be buoyant, as if all\nweight had departed from it; so much so, that now and then I\nscarcely knew that my feet touched the ground.  But during the\nrapture itself the body is very often as if it were dead,\nperfectly powerless.  It continues in the position it was in when\nthe rapture came upon it--if sitting, sitting; if the hands were\nopen, or if they were shut, they will remain open or shut. [21]\nFor though the senses fail but rarely, it has happened to me\noccasionally to lose them wholly--seldom, however, and then only\nfor a short time.  But in general they are in disorder; and\nthough they have no power whatever to deal with outward things,\nthere remains the power of hearing and seeing; but it is as if\nthe things heard and seen were at a great distance, far away.\n24. I do not say that the soul sees and hears when the rapture is\nat the highest,--I mean by at the highest, when the faculties are\nlost, because profoundly united with God,--for then it neither\nsees, nor hears, nor perceives, as I believe; but, as I said of\nthe previous prayer of union, [22] this utter transformation of\nthe soul in God continues only for an instant; yet while it\ncontinues no faculty of the soul is aware of it, or knows what is\npassing there.  Nor can it be understood while we are living on\nthe earth--at least, God will not have us understand it, because\nwe must be incapable of understanding it.  I know it\nby experience.\n25. You, my father, will ask me: How comes it, then, that a\nrapture occasionally lasts so many hours?  What has often\nhappened to me is this,--I spoke of it before, when writing of\nthe previous state of prayer, [23]--the rapture is not\ncontinuous, the soul is frequently absorbed, or, to speak more\ncorrectly, our Lord absorbs it in Himself; and when He has held\nit thus for a moment, the will alone remains in union with Him.\nThe movements of the two other faculties seem to me to be like\nthose of the needle of sun-dials, which is never at rest; yet\nwhen the Sun of Justice will have it so, He can hold it still.\n26. This I speak of lasts but a moment; yet, as the impulse and\nthe upraising of the spirit were vehement, and though the other\nfaculties bestir themselves again, the will continues absorbed,\nand causes this operation in the body, as if it were the absolute\nmistress; for now that the two other faculties are restless, and\nattempt to disturb it, it takes care--for if it is to have\nenemies, the fewer the better--that the senses also shall not\ntrouble it: and thus it comes to pass that the senses are\nsuspended; for so our Lord wills it.  And for the most part the\neyes are closed, though we may not wish to close them; and if\noccasionally they remain open, as I said just now, the soul\nneither discerns nor considers what it sees.\n27. What the body then can do here is still less in order that,\nwhen the faculties come together again, there may not be so much\nto do.  Let him, therefore, to whom our Lord has granted this\ngrace, be not discouraged when he finds himself in this\nstate--the body under constraint for many hours, the\nunderstanding and the memory occasionally astray.  The truth is\nthat, in general, they are inebriated with the praises of God, or\nwith searching to comprehend or understand that which has passed\nover them.  And yet even for this they are not thoroughly awake,\nbut are rather like one who has slept long, and dreamed, and is\nhardly yet awake.\n28. I dwell so long on this point because I know that there are\npersons now, even in this place, [24] to whom our Lord is\ngranting these graces; and if their directors have had no\nexperience in the matter, they will think, perhaps, that they\nmust be as dead persons during the trance--and they will think so\nthe more if they have no learning.  It is piteous to see what\nthose confessors who do not understand this make people suffer.\nI shall speak of it by and by. [25]  Perhaps I do not know what I\nam saying.  You, my father, will understand it, if I am at all\ncorrect; for our Lord has admitted you to the experience of it:\nyet, because that experience is not very great, it may be,\nperhaps, that you have not considered the matter so much as I\nhave done.\n29. So then, though I do all I can, my body has no strength to\nmove for some time; the soul took it all away.  Very often, too,\nhe who was before sickly and full of pain remains healthy, and\neven stronger; for it is something great that is given to the\nsoul in rapture; and sometimes, as I have said already, [26] our\nLord will have the body rejoice, because it is obedient in that\nwhich the soul requires of it.  When we recover our\nconsciousness, the faculties may remain, if the rapture has been\ndeep, for a day or two, and even for three days, so absorbed, or\nas if stunned,--so much so, as to be in appearance no\nlonger themselves.\n30. Here comes the pain of returning to this life; here it is the\nwings of the soul grew, to enable it to fly so high: the weak\nfeathers are fallen off.  Now the standard of Christ is raised up\naloft, which seems to be nothing else but the going up, or the\ncarrying up, of the Captain of the fort to the highest tower of\nit, there to raise up the standard of God.  The soul, as in a\nplace of safety, looks down on those below; it fears no dangers\nnow--yea, rather, it courts them, as one assured beforehand of\nvictory.  It sees most clearly how lightly are the things of this\nworld to be esteemed, and the nothingness thereof. The soul now\nseeks not, and possesses not, any other will but that of doing\nour Lord's will, [27] and so it prays Him to let it be so; it\ngives to Him the keys of its own will.  Lo, the gardener is now\nbecome the commander of a fortress!  The soul will do nothing but\nthe will of our Lord; it will not act as the owner even of\nitself, nor of anything, not even of a single apple in the\norchard; only, if there be any good thing in the garden, it is at\nHis Majesty's disposal; for from henceforth the soul will have\nnothing of its own,--all it seeks is to do everything for His\nglory, and according to His will.\n31. This is really the way in which these things come to pass; if\nthe raptures be true raptures, the fruits and advantages spoken\nof abide in the soul; but if they did not, I should have great\ndoubts about their being from God--yea, rather, I should be\nafraid they were those frenzies of which St. Vincent speaks. [28]\nI have seen it myself, and I know it by experience, that the soul\nin rapture is mistress of everything, and acquires such freedom\nin one hour, and even in less, as to be unable to recognize\nitself.  It sees distinctly that all this does not belong to it,\nneither knows it how it came to possess so great a good; but it\nclearly perceives the very great blessing which every one of\nthese raptures always brings.  No one will believe this who has\nnot had experience of it, and so they do not believe the poor\nsoul: they saw it lately so wicked, and now they see it pretend\nto things of so high an order; for it is not satisfied with\nserving our Lord in the common way,--it must do so forthwith in\nthe highest way it can.  They consider this a temptation and a\nfolly; yet they would not be astonished, if they knew that it\ncomes not from the soul, but from our Lord, to whom it has given\nup the keys of its will.\n32. For my part, I believe that a soul which has reached this\nstate neither speaks nor acts of itself, but rather that the\nsupreme King takes care of all it has to do.  O my God, how clear\nis the meaning of those words, and what good reason the Psalmist\nhad, and all the world will ever have, to pray for the wings of a\ndove! [29]  It is plain that this is the flight of the spirit\nrising upwards above all created things, and chiefly above\nitself: but it is a sweet flight, a delicious flight--a flight\nwithout noise.\n33. Oh, what power that soul possesses which our Lord raises to\nthis state! how it looks down upon everything, entangled by\nnothing! how ashamed it is of the time when it was entangled! how\nit is amazed at its own blindness! how it pities those who are\nstill in darkness, especially if they are men of prayer, and have\nreceived consolations from God!  It would like to cry out to\nthem, that they might be made to see the delusions they are in:\nand, indeed, it does so now and then; and then a thousand\npersecutions fall upon it as a shower.  People consider it\nwanting in humility, and think it means to teach those from whom\nit should learn, particularly if it be a woman.  Hence its\ncondemnation; and not without reason; because they know not how\nstrong the influence is that moves it.  The soul at times cannot\nhelp itself; nor can it refrain from undeceiving those it loves,\nand whom it longs to see delivered out of the prison of this\nlife; for that state in which the soul itself had been before\nneither is, nor seems to be, anything else but a prison.\n34. The soul is weary of the days during which it respected\npoints of honour, and the delusion which led it to believe that\nto be honour which the world calls by that name; now it sees it\nto be the greatest lie, and that we are all walking therein.\nIt understands that true honour is not delusive, but real,\nesteeming that which is worthy of esteem, and despising that\nwhich is despicable; for everything is nothing, and less than\nnothing, whatever passeth away, and is not pleasing unto God.\nThe soul laughs at itself when it thinks of the time in which it\nregarded money, and desired to possess it,--though, as to this, I\nverily believe that I never had to confess such a fault; it was\nfault enough to have regarded money at all.  If I could purchase\nwith money the blessings which I possess, I should make much of\nit; but it is plain that these blessings are gained by abandoning\nall things.\n35. What is there that is procurable by this money which we\ndesire?  Is it anything of worth, and anything lasting?\nWhy, then, do we desire it?  A dismal resting place it provides,\nwhich costs so dear!  Very often it obtains for us hell itself,\nfire everlasting, and torments without end.  Oh, if all men would\nbut regard it as profitless dross, how peaceful the world would\nbe! how free from bargaining!  How friendly all men would be one\nwith another, if no regard were paid to honour and money!\nI believe it would be a remedy for everything.\n36. The soul sees how blind men are to the nature of\npleasure--how by means of it they provide for themselves trouble\nand disquietude even in this life.  What restlessness! how little\nsatisfaction! what labour in vain!  It sees, too, not only the\ncobwebs that cover it, and its great faults, but also the specks\nof dirt, however slight they may be; for the sun shines most\nclearly; and thus, however much the soul may have laboured at its\nown perfection, it sees itself to be very unclean, if the rays of\nthe sun fall really upon it.  The soul is like water in a vessel,\nwhich appears pellucid when the sun does not shine through it;\nbut if it does, the water then is found to be full of motes.\n37. This comparison is literally correct.  Before the soul fell\ninto the trance, it thought itself to be careful about not\noffending God, and that it did what it could in proportion to its\nstrength; but now that it has attained to this state, in which\nthe Sun of Justice shines upon it, and makes it open its eyes, it\nbeholds so many motes, that it would gladly close them again.\nIt is not so truly the child of the noble eagle, that it can gaze\nupon the sun; but, for the few instants it can keep them open, it\nbeholds itself wholly unclean.  It remembers the words: \"Who\nshall be just in Thy presence?\" [30]  When it looks on this\nDivine Sun, the brightness thereof dazzles it,--when it looks on\nitself, its eyes are blinded by the dust: the little dove is\nblind.  So it happens very often: the soul is utterly blinded,\nabsorbed, amazed, dizzy at the vision of so much grandeur.\n38. It is in rapture that true humility is acquired--humility\nthat will never say any good of self, nor suffer others to do so.\nThe Lord of the garden, not the soul, distributes the fruit\nthereof, and so none remains in its hands; all the good it has,\nit refers to God; if it says anything about itself, it is for His\nglory.  It knows that it possesses nothing here; and even if it\nwished, it cannot continue ignorant of that.  It sees this, as it\nwere, with the naked eye; for, whether it will or not, its eyes\nare shut against the things of this world, and open to see\nthe truth.\n1. See Inner Fortress, vi. ch. v.; Philippus a SS. Trinitate,\nTheolog. Mystic. par. iii. tr. i, disp. iii., art. 3; \"H\u00e6c oratio\nraptus superior est pr\u00e6cedentibus orationis gradibus, etiam\noratione unionis ordinari\u00e6, et habet effectus multo\nexcellentiores et multas alias operationes.\"\n2. \"She says that rapture is more excellent than union; that is,\nthat the soul in a rapture has a greater fruition of God, and\nthat God takes it then more into His own hands.  That is\nevidently so; because in a rapture the soul loses the use of its\nexterior and interior faculties.  When she says that union is the\nbeginning, middle, and end, she means that pure union is almost\nalways uniform; but that there are degrees in rapture, of which\nsome are, as it were, the beginning, some the middle, others the\nend.  That is the reason why it is called by different names;\nsome of which denote the least, others the most, perfect form of\nit, as it will appear hereafter.\"--Note in the Spanish edition of\nLopez (De la\u00a0Fuente).\n3.

Pain of the Awakening.\nLight Against Delusions.\n1. To bring this matter to an end, I say that it is not necessary\nfor the soul to give its consent here; it is already given: the\nsoul knows that it has given up its will into His hands, [1] and\nthat it cannot deceive Him, because He knoweth all things.  It is\nnot here as it is in the world, where all life is full of deceit\nand double-dealing.  When you think you have gained one man's\ngood will, because of the outward show he makes, you afterwards\nlearn that all was a lie.  No one can live in the midst of so\nmuch scheming, particularly if there be any interests at stake.\n2. Blessed, then, is that soul which our Lord draws on to the\nunderstanding of the truth!  Oh, what a state for kings!\nHow much better it would be for them if they strove for this,\nrather than for great dominions!  How justice would prevail under\ntheir rule!  What evils would be prevented, and might have been\nprevented already!  Here no man fears to lose life or honour for\nthe love of God.  What a grand thing this would be to him who is\nmore bound than those beneath him to regard the honour of our\nLord!--for it is kings whom the crowd must follow.  To make one\nstep in the propagation of the faith, and to give one ray of\nlight to heretics, I would forfeit a thousand kingdoms.  And with\ngood reason: for it is another thing altogether to gain a kingdom\nthat shall never end, because one drop of the water of that\nkingdom, if the soul but tastes it, renders the things of this\nworld utterly loathsome.\n3. If, then, the soul should be wholly engulfed, what then?\nO Lord, if Thou wert to give me the right to publish this abroad,\npeople would not believe me--as they do not believe many who are\nable to speak of it in a way very different from mine; but I\nshould satisfy myself, at least.  I believe I should count my\nlife as nothing, if I might make others understand but one of\nthese truths.  I know not what I shall do afterwards, for I\ncannot trust myself; though I am what I am, I have a violent\ndesire, which is wasting me, to say this to those who are in\nauthority.  And now that I can do no more, I betake myself to\nThee, O my Lord, to implore a remedy for all.  Thou knowest well\nthat I would gladly divest myself of all the graces which Thou\nhast given me,--provided I remained in a condition never to\noffend Thee,--and give them up to those who are kings; for I know\nit would then be impossible for them to allow what they allow\nnow, or fail to receive the very greatest blessings.\n4. O my God, make kings to understand how far their obligations\nreach!  Thou hast been pleased to distinguish them on earth in\nsuch a way that--so I have heard--Thou showest signs in the\nheavens when Thou takest any of them away.  Certainly, when I\nthink of this, my devotion is stirred, because Thou wilt have\nthem learn, O my King, even from this, that they must imitate\nThee in their lives, seeing that, when they die, signs are\nvisible in the heavens, as it was when Thou wert dying Thyself.\n5. I am very bold; if it be wrong, you, my father, will tear this\nout: only believe that I should speak much more to the purpose in\nthe presence of kings,--if I might, or thought they would listen\nto me,--for I recommend them greatly to God, and I wish I might\nbe of service to them.  All this makes one risk life; for I long\nfrequently to lose mine,--and that would be to lose a little for\nthe chance of gaining much; for surely it is not possible to\nlive, when we see with our eyes the great delusion wherein we are\nwalking, and the blindness in which we are living.\n6. A soul that has attained to this is not limited to the desires\nit has to serve God; for His Majesty gives it strength to bring\nthose desires to good effect.  Nothing can be put before it into\nwhich it will not throw itself, if only it thinks that God may be\nserved thereby: and yet it is doing nothing, because, as I said\nbefore, [2] it sees clearly that all is nothing, except pleasing\nGod.  The trial is, that those who are so worthless as I am, have\nno trial of the kind.  May it be Thy good pleasure, O my God,\nthat the time may come in which I may be able to pay one farthing\nat least, of the heavy debt I owe Thee!  Do Thou, O Lord, so\ndispose matters according to Thy will, that this Thy servant may\ndo Thee some service.  Other women there have been who did heroic\ndeeds for Thee; I am good only to talk; and so it has not been\nThy pleasure, O my God, that I should do any thing: all ends in\ntalk and desires--that is all my service.  And yet even in this I\nam not free, because it is possible I might fail altogether.\n7. Strengthen Thou my soul, and prepare it, O Good of all good;\nand, my Jesus, then ordain Thou the means whereby I may do\nsomething for Thee, so that there may be not even one who can\nbear to receive so much, and make no payment in return.  Cost\nwhat it may, O Lord, let me not come before Thee with hands so\nempty, [3] seeing that the reward of every one will be according\nto his works. [4]  Behold my life, behold my good name and my\nwill; I have given them all to Thee; I am Thine: dispose of me\naccording to Thy will.  I see well enough, O Lord, how little I\ncan do; but now, having drawn near to Thee,--having ascended to\nthis watchtower, from which the truth may be seen,--and while\nThou departest not from me, I can do all things; but if Thou\ndepartest from me, were it but for a moment, I shall go thither\nwhere I was once--that is, to hell. [5]\n8. Oh, what it is for a soul in this state to have to return to\nthe commerce of the world, to see and look on the farce of this\nlife, [6] so ill-ordered; to waste its time in attending to the\nbody by sleeping and eating! [7]  All is wearisome; it cannot run\naway,--it sees itself chained and imprisoned; it feels then most\nkeenly the captivity into which the body has brought us, and the\nwretchedness of this life.  It understands the reason why\nSt. Paul prayed to God to deliver him from it. [8]  The soul\ncries with the Apostle, and calls upon God to deliver it, as I\nsaid on another occasion. [9]  But here it often cries with so\nmuch violence, that it seems as if it would go out of the body in\nsearch of its freedom, now that they do not take it away.  It is\nas a slave sold into a strange land; and what distresses it most\nis, that it cannot find many who make the same complaint and the\nsame prayer: the desire of life is more common.\n9. Oh, if we were utterly detached,--if we never placed our\nhappiness in anything of this world,--how the pain, caused by\nliving always away from God, would temper the fear of death with\nthe desire of enjoying the true life!  Sometimes I consider, if a\nperson like myself--because our Lord has given this light to me,\nwhose love is so cold, and whose true rest is so uncertain, for I\nhave not deserved it by my works--frequently feels her banishment\nso much, what the feelings of the Saints must have been.\nWhat must St. Paul and the Magdalene, and others like them, have\nsuffered, in whom the fire of the love of God has grown so\nstrong?  Their life must have been a continual martyrdom.\nIt seems to me that they who bring me any comfort, and whose\nconversation is any relief, are those persons in whom I find\nthese desires--I mean, desires with acts.  I say with acts, for\nthere are people who think themselves detached, and who say so of\nthemselves,--and it must be so, for their vocation demands it, as\nwell as the many years that are passed since some of them began\nto walk in the way of perfection,--but my soul distinguishes\nclearly, and afar off, between those who are detached in words,\nand those who make good those words by deeds.  The little\nprogress of the former, and the great progress of the latter,\nmake it plain.  This is a matter which a person of any experience\ncan see into most clearly.\n10. So far, then, of the effects of those raptures which come\nfrom the Spirit of God.  The truth is, that these are greater or\nless.  I say less, because in the beginning, though the effects\nare wrought, they are not tested by works, and so it cannot be\nclear that a person has them; and perfection, too, is a thing of\ngrowth, and of labouring after freedom from the cobwebs of\nmemory; and this requires some time.  Meanwhile, the greater the\ngrowth of love and humility in the soul, the stronger the perfume\nof the flowers of virtues is for itself and for others. The truth\nis, that our Lord can so work in the soul in an instant during\nthese raptures, that but little remains for the soul to do in\norder to attain to perfection.  No one, who has not had\nexperience of it, will ever be able to believe what our Lord now\nbestows on the soul.  No effort of ours--so I think--can ever\nreach so far.\n11. However, I do not mean to say that those persons who during\nmany years make use of the method prescribed by writers on\nprayer,--who discuss the principles thereof, and the means\nwhereby it may be acquired,--will not, by the help of our Lord,\nattain to perfection and great detachment with much labour; but\nthey will not attain to it so rapidly as by the way of raptures,\nin which our Lord works independently of us, draws the soul\nutterly away from earth, and gives it dominion over all things\nhere below, though the merits of that soul may not be greater\nthan mine were: I cannot use stronger language, for my merits are\nas nothing.  Why His Majesty doeth this is, because it is His\npleasure, and He doeth it according to His pleasure; even if the\nsoul be without the fitting disposition, He disposes it for the\nreception of that blessing which He is giving to it.  Although it\nbe most certain that He never fails to comfort those who do well,\nand strive to be detached, still He does not always give these\neffects because they have deserved them at His hands by\ncultivating the garden, but because it is His will to show His\ngreatness at times in a soil which is most worthless, as I have\njust said, and to prepare it for all good: and all this in such a\nway that it seems as if the soul was now, in a manner, unable to\ngo back and live in sin against God, as it did before.\n12. The mind is now so inured to the comprehension of that which\nis truth indeed, that everything else seems to it to be but\nchild's play.  It laughs to itself, at times, when it sees grave\nmen--men given to prayer, men of religion--make much of points of\nhonour, which itself is trampling beneath its feet.  They say\nthat discretion, and the dignity of their callings, require it of\nthem as a means to do more good; but that soul knows perfectly\nwell that they would do more good in one day by preferring the\nlove of God to this their dignity, than they will do in ten years\nby considering it.\n13. The life of this soul is a life of trouble: the cross is\nalways there, but the progress it makes is great.  When those who\nhave to do with it think it has arrived at the summit of\nperfection, within a little while they see it much more advanced;\nfor God is ever giving it grace upon grace.  God is the soul of\nthat soul now; it is He who has the charge of it; and so He\nenlightens it; for He seems to be watching over it, always\nattentive to it, that it may not offend Him,--giving it grace,\nand stirring it up in His service.  When my soul reached this\nstate, in which God showed me mercy so great, my wretchedness\ncame to an end, and our Lord gave me strength to rise above it.\nThe former occasions of sin, as well as the persons with whom I\nwas accustomed to distract myself, did me no more harm than if\nthey had never existed; on the contrary, that which ordinarily\ndid me harm, helped me on.  Everything contributed to make me\nknow God more, and to love Him; to make me see how much I owed\nHim, as well as to be sorry for being what I had been.\n14. I saw clearly that this did not come from myself, that I had\nnot brought it about by any efforts of my own, and that there was\nnot time enough for it.  His Majesty, of His mere goodness, had\ngiven me strength for it.  From the time our Lord began to give\nme the grace of raptures, until now, this strength has gone on\nincreasing.  He, of His goodness, hath held me by the hand, that\nI might not go back.  I do not think that I am doing anything\nmyself--certainly I do not; for I see distinctly that all this is\nthe work of our Lord.  For this reason, it seems to me that the\nsoul in which our Lord worketh these graces,--if it walks in\nhumility and fear, always acknowledging the work of our Lord, and\nthat we ourselves can do, as it were, nothing,--may be thrown\namong any companions, and, however distracted and wicked these\nmay be, will neither be hurt nor disturbed in any way; on the\ncontrary, as I have just said, that will help it on, and be a\nmeans unto it whereby it may derive much greater profit.\n15. Those souls are strong which are chosen by our Lord to do\ngood to others; still, this their strength is not their own.\nWhen our Lord brings a soul on to this state, He communicates to\nit of His greatest secrets by degrees.  True revelations--the\ngreat gifts and visions--come by ecstasies, all tending to make\nthe soul humble and strong, to make it despise the things of this\nworld, and have a clearer knowledge of the greatness of the\nreward which our Lord has prepared for those who serve Him.

The Sacred Humanity\nMust Be the Road to the Highest Contemplation.  A Delusion in\nWhich the Saint Was Once Entangled.\n1. There is one thing I should like to say--I think it important:\nand if you, my father, approve, it will serve for a lesson that\npossibly may be necessary; for in some books on prayer the\nwriters say that the soul, though it cannot in its own strength\nattain to this state,--because it is altogether a supernatural\nwork wrought in it by our Lord,--may nevertheless succeed, by\nlifting up the spirit above all created things, and raising it\nupwards in humility, after some years spent in a purgative life,\nand advancing in the illuminative.  I do not very well know what\nthey mean by illuminative: I understand it to mean the life of\nthose who are making progress.  And they advise us much to\nwithdraw from all bodily imagination, and draw near to the\ncontemplation of the Divinity; for they say that those who have\nadvanced so far would be embarrassed or hindered in their way to\nthe highest contemplation, if they regarded even the Sacred\nHumanity itself. [1]  They defend their opinion [2] by bringing\nforward the words [3] of our Lord to the Apostles, concerning the\ncoming of the Holy Ghost; I mean that Coming which was after the\nAscension.  If the Apostles had believed, as they believed after\nthe Coming of the Holy Ghost, that He is both God and Man, His\nbodily Presence would, in my opinion, have been no hindrance; for\nthose words were not said to the Mother of God, though she loved\nHim more than all. [4]  They think that, as this work of\ncontemplation is wholly spiritual, any bodily object whatever can\ndisturb or hinder it.  They say that the contemplative should\nregard himself as being within a definite space, God everywhere\naround, and himself absorbed in Him.  This is what we should\naim at.\n2. This seems to me right enough now and then; but to withdraw\naltogether from Christ, and to compare His divine Body with our\nmiseries or with any created thing whatever, is what I cannot\nendure.  May God help me to explain myself!  I am not\ncontradicting them on this point, for they are learned and\nspiritual persons, understanding what they say: God, too, is\nguiding souls by many ways and methods, as He has guided mine.\nIt is of my own soul that I wish to speak now,--I do not\nintermeddle with others,--and of the danger I was in because I\nwould comply with the directions I was reading.  I can well\nbelieve that he who has attained to union, and advances no\nfurther,--that is, to raptures, visions, and other graces of God\ngiven to souls,--will consider that opinion to be best, as I did\nmyself: and if I had continued in it, I believe I should never\nhave reached the state I am in now.  I hold it to be a delusion:\nstill, it may be that it is I who am deluded.  But I will tell\nyou what happened to me.\n3. As I had no director, I used to read these books, where, by\nlittle and little, I thought I might understand something.\nI found out afterwards that, if our Lord had not shown me the\nway, I should have learned but little from books; for I\nunderstood really nothing till His Majesty made me learn by\nexperience: neither did I know what I was doing.  So, in the\nbeginning, when I attained to some degree of supernatural\nprayer,--I speak of the prayer of quiet,--I laboured to remove\nfrom myself every thought of bodily objects; but I did not dare\nto lift up my soul, for that I saw would be presumption in me,\nwho was always so wicked. I thought, however, that I had a sense\nof the presence of God: this was true, and I contrived to be in a\nstate of recollection before Him.  This method of prayer is full\nof sweetness, if God helps us in it, and the joy of it is great.\nAnd so, because I was conscious of the profit and delight which\nthis way furnished me, no one could have brought me back to the\ncontemplation of the Sacred Humanity; for that seemed to me to be\na real hindrance to prayer.\n4. O Lord of my soul, and my Good!  Jesus Christ crucified!\nI never think of this opinion, which I then held, without pain; I\nbelieve it was an act of high treason, though done in ignorance.\nHitherto, I had been all my life long so devout to the Sacred\nHumanity--for this happened but lately; I mean by lately, that it\nwas before our Lord gave me the grace of raptures and visions.\nI did not continue long of this opinion, [5] and so I returned to\nmy habit of delighting in our Lord, particularly at Communion.\nI wish I could have His picture and image always before my eyes,\nsince I cannot have Him graven in my soul as deeply as I wish.\n5. Is it possible, O my Lord, that I could have had the thought,\nif only for an hour, that Thou couldst be a hindrance to my\ngreatest good?  Whence are all my blessings? are they not from\nThee?  I will not think that I was blamable, for I was very sorry\nfor it, and it was certainly done in ignorance.  And so it\npleased Thee, in Thy goodness, to succour me, by sending me one\nwho has delivered me from this delusion; and afterwards by\nshowing Thyself to me so many times, as I shall relate\nhereafter, [6] that I might clearly perceive how great my\ndelusion was, and also tell it to many persons; which I have\ndone, as well as describe it as I am doing now.  I believe myself\nthat this is the reason why so many souls, after advancing to the\nprayer of union, make no further progress, and do not attain to\nvery great liberty of spirit.\n6. It seems to me, that there are two considerations on which I\nmay ground this opinion.  Perhaps I am saying nothing to the\npurpose, yet what I say is the result of experience; for my soul\nwas in a very evil plight, till our Lord enlightened it: all its\njoys were but sips; and when it had come forth therefrom, it\nnever found itself in that company which afterwards it had in\ntrials and temptations.\n7. The first consideration is this: there is a little absence of\nhumility--so secret and so hidden, that we do not observe it.\nWho is there so proud and wretched as I, that, even after\nlabouring all his life in penances and prayers and persecutions,\ncan possibly imagine himself not to be exceedingly rich, most\nabundantly rewarded, when our Lord permits him to stand with\nSt. John at the foot of the cross?  I know not into whose head it\ncould have entered to be not satisfied with this, unless it be\nmine, which has gone wrong in every way where it should have gone\nright onwards.\n8. Then, if our constitution--or perhaps sickness--will not\npermit us always to think of His Passion, because it is so\npainful, who is to hinder us from thinking of Him risen from the\ngrave, seeing that we have Him so near us in the Sacrament, where\nhe is glorified, and where we shall not see Him in His great\nweariness--scourged, streaming with blood, faint by the way,\npersecuted by those to whom He had done good, and not believed in\nby the Apostles?  Certainly it is not always that one can bear to\nmeditate on sufferings so great as were those He underwent.\nBehold Him here, before His ascension into heaven, without pain,\nall-glorious, giving strength to some and courage to others.\nIn the most Holy Sacrament, He is our companion, as if it was not\nin His power to withdraw Himself for a moment from us.  And yet\nit was in my power to withdraw from Thee, O my Lord, that I might\nserve Thee better!  It may be that I knew Thee not when I sinned\nagainst Thee; but how could I, having once known Thee, ever think\nI should gain more in this way?  O Lord, what an evil way I took!\nand I was going out of the way, if Thou hadst not brought me back\nto it.  When I see Thee near me, I see all good things together.\nNo trial befalls me that is not easy to bear, when I think of\nThee standing before those who judged Thee.\n9. With so good a Friend and Captain ever present, Himself the\nfirst to suffer, everything can be borne.  He helps, He\nstrengthens, He never fails, He is the true Friend.  I see\nclearly, and since then have always seen, that if we are to\nplease God, and if He is to give us His great graces, everything\nmust pass through the hands of His most Sacred Humanity, in whom\nHis Majesty said that He is well pleased. [7]  I know this by\nrepeated experience: our Lord has told it me.  I have seen\nclearly that this is the door [8] by which we are to enter, if we\nwould have His supreme Majesty reveal to us His great secrets.\n10. So, then, I would have your reverence seek no other way, even\nif you were arrived at the highest contemplation.  This way is\nsafe.  Our Lord is He by whom all good things come to us; He will\nteach you.  Consider His life; that is the best example. What\nmore can we want than so good a Friend at our side, who will not\nforsake us when we are in trouble and distress, as they do who\nbelong to this world!  Blessed is he who truly loves Him, and who\nalways has Him near him!  Let us consider the glorious St. Paul,\nwho seems as if Jesus was never absent from his lips, as if he\nhad Him deep down in his heart.  After I had heard this of some\ngreat Saints given to contemplation, I considered the matter\ncarefully; and I see that they walked in no other way.\nSt. Francis with the stigmata proves it, St. Antony of Padua with\nthe Infant Jesus; St. Bernard rejoiced in the Sacred Humanity; so\ndid St. Catherine of Siena, and many others, as your reverence\nknows better than I do.\n11. This withdrawing from bodily objects must no doubt be good,\nseeing that it is recommended by persons who are so spiritual;\nbut, in my opinion, it ought to be done only when the soul has\nmade very great progress; for until then it is clear that the\nCreator must be sought for through His creatures.  All this\ndepends on the grace which our Lord distributes to every soul.\nI do not intermeddle here.  What I would say is, that the most\nSacred Humanity of Christ is not to be counted among the objects\nfrom which we have to withdraw.  Let this be clearly understood.\nI wish I knew how to explain it. [9]\n12. When God suspends all the powers of the soul,--as we see He\ndoes in the states of prayer already described,--it is clear\nthat, whether we wish it or not, this presence is withdrawn.\nBe it so, then.  The loss is a blessed one, because it takes\nplace in order that we may have a deeper fruition of what we seem\nto have lost; for at that moment the whole soul is occupied in\nloving Him whom the understanding has toiled to know; and it\nloves what it has not comprehended, and rejoices in what it could\nnot have rejoiced in so well, if it had not lost itself, in\norder, as I am saying, to gain itself the more.  But that we\nshould carefully and laboriously accustom ourselves not to strive\nwith all our might to have always--and please God it be\nalways!--the most Sacred Humanity before our eyes,--this, I say,\nis what seems to me not to be right: it is making the soul, as\nthey say, to walk in the air; for it has nothing to rest on, how\nfull soever of God it may think itself to be.\n13. It is a great matter for us to have our Lord before us as Man\nwhile we are living and in the flesh.  This is that other\ninconvenience which I say must be met with.  The first--I have\nalready begun to describe it--is a little failure in humility, in\nthat the soul desires to rise of itself before our Lord raises\nit, and is not satisfied with meditation on so excellent a\nsubject,--seeking to be Mary before it has laboured with Martha.\nIf our Lord will have a soul to be Mary, even on the first day,\nthere is nothing to be afraid of; but we must not be self-invited\nguests, as I think I said on another occasion. [10]  This little\nmote of want of humility, though in appearance a mere nothing,\ndoes a great deal of harm to those who wish to advance\nin contemplation.\n14. I now come back to the second consideration.  We are not\nangels, for we have a body; to seek to make ourselves angels\nwhile we are on the earth, and so much on the earth as I was, is\nan act of folly.  In general, our thoughts must have something to\nrest on, though the soul may go forth out of itself now and then,\nor it may be very often so full of God as to be in need of no\ncreated thing by the help of which it may recollect itself.\nBut this is not so common a case; for when we have many things to\ndo, when we are persecuted and in trouble, when we cannot have\nmuch rest, and when we have our seasons of dryness, Christ is our\nbest Friend; for we regard Him as Man, and behold Him faint and\nin trouble, and He is our Companion; and when we shall have\naccustomed ourselves in this way, it is very easy to find Him\nnear us, although there will be occasions from time to time when\nwe can do neither the one nor the other.\n15. For this end, that is useful which I spoke of before: [11] we\nmust not show ourselves as labouring after spiritual\nconsolations; come what may, to embrace the cross is the great\nthing.  The Lord of all consolation was Himself forsaken: they\nleft Him alone in His sorrows.  Do not let us forsake Him; for\nHis hand will help us to rise more than any efforts we can make;\nand He will withdraw Himself when He sees it be expedient for us,\nand when He pleaseth will also draw the soul forth out of itself,\nas I said before. [12]\n16. God is greatly pleased when He beholds a soul in its humility\nmaking His Son a Mediator between itself and Him, and yet loving\nHim so much as to confess its own unworthiness, even when He\nwould raise it up to the highest contemplation, and saying with\nSt. Peter: [13] \"Go Thou away from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful\nman.\"  I know this by experience: it was thus that God directed\nmy soul.  Others may walk, as I said before, [14] by another and\na shorter road.  What I have understood of the matter is this:\nthat the whole foundation of prayer must be laid in humility, and\nthat the more a soul humbles itself in prayer, the more God lifts\nit up.  I do not remember that He ever showed me any of those\nmarvellous mercies, of which I shall speak hereafter, [15] at any\nother time than when I was as one brought to nothing, [16] by\nseeing how wicked I was.  Moreover, His Majesty contrived to make\nme understand matters that helped me to know myself, but which I\ncould never have even imagined of myself.\n17. I believe myself that if a soul makes any efforts of its own\nto further itself in the way of the prayer of union, and though\nit may seem to make immediate progress, it will quickly fall\nback, because the foundations were not duly laid.  I fear, too,\nthat such a soul will never attain to true poverty of spirit,\nwhich consists in seeking consolation or sweetness, not in\nprayer,--the consolations of the earth are already\nabandoned,--but rather in sorrows, for the love of Him who always\nlived in sorrows Himself; [17] and in being calm in the midst of\nsorrows and aridities.  Though the soul may feel it in some\nmeasure, there is no disquiet, nor any of that pain which some\npersons suffer, who, if they are not always labouring with the\nunderstanding and with a sense of devotion, think everything\nlost,--as if their efforts merited so great a blessing!\n18. I am not saying that men should not seek to be devout, nor\nthat they should not stand with great reverence in the presence\nof God, but only that they are not to vex themselves if they\ncannot find even one good thought, as I said in another\nplace; [18] for we are unprofitable servants. [19]  What do we\nthink we can do?  Our Lord grant that we understand this, and\nthat we may be those little asses who drive the windlass I spoke\nof: [20] these, though their eyes are bandaged, and they do not\nunderstand what they are doing, yet draw up more water than the\ngardener can draw with all his efforts.  We must walk in liberty\non this road, committing ourselves into the hands of God.  If it\nbe His Majesty's good pleasure to raise us and place us among His\nchamberlains and secret councillors, we must go willingly; if\nnot, we must serve Him in the lower offices of His house, and not\nsit down on the upper seats. [21]  As I have sometimes said, [22]\nGod is more careful of us than we are ourselves, and knows what\neach one of us is fit for.\n19. What use is there in governing oneself by oneself, when the\nwhole will has been given up to God? I think this less endurable\nnow than in the first state of prayer, and it does much greater\nharm; for these blessings are supernatural.  If a man has a bad\nvoice, let him force himself ever so much to sing, he will never\nimprove it; but if God gives him a good voice, he has no need to\ntry it twice.  Let us, then, pray Him always to show His mercy\nupon us, with a submissive spirit, yet trusting in the goodness\nof God.  And now that the soul is permitted to sit at the feet of\nChrist, let it contrive not to quit its place, but keep it\nanyhow.  Let it follow the example of the Magdalene; and when it\nshall be strong enough, God will lead it into\nthe wilderness. [23]\n20. You, then, my father, must be content with this until you\nmeet with some one of more experience and better knowledge than I\nam.  If you see people who are beginning to taste of God, do not\ntrust them if they think that they advance more, and have a\ndeeper fruition of God, when they make efforts of their own.\nOh, when God wills it, how He discovers Himself without these\nlittle efforts of ours!  We may do what we like, but He throws\nthe spirit into a trance as easily as a giant takes up a straw;\nno resistance is possible.  What a thing to believe, that God\nwill wait till the toad shall fly of itself, when He has already\nwilled it should do so!  Well, it seems to me still more\ndifficult and hard for our spirit to rise upwards, if God does\nnot raise it, seeing that it is burdened with earth, and hindered\nin a thousand ways.  Its willingness to rise is of no service to\nit; for, though an aptness for flying be more natural to it than\nto a toad, yet is it so sunk in the mire as to have lost it by\nits own fault.\n21. I come, then, to this conclusion: whenever we think of\nChrist, we should remind ourselves of the love that made Him\nbestow so many graces upon us, and also how great that love is\nwhich our Lord God has shown us, in giving us such a pledge of\nthe love He bears us; for love draws forth love.  And though we\nare only at the very beginning, and exceedingly wicked, yet let\nus always labour to keep this in view, and stir ourselves up to\nlove; for if once our Lord grants us this grace, of having this\nlove imprinted in our hearts, everything will be easy, and we\nshall do great things in a very short time, and with very little\nlabour.  May His Majesty give us that love,--He knows the great\nneed we have of it,--for the sake of that love which He bore us,\nand of His glorious Son, to whom it cost so much to make it known\nto us!  Amen.\n22. There is one thing I should like to ask you, my father.\nHow is it that, when our Lord begins to bestow upon a soul a\ngrace so great as this of perfect contemplation, it is not, as it\nought to be, perfect at once?  Certainly, it seems it should be\nso; for he who receives a grace so great ought never more to seek\nconsolations on earth.  How is it, I ask, that a soul which has\necstasies and so far is more accustomed to receive graces, should\nyet seem to bring forth fruits still higher and higher,--and the\nmore so, the more it is detached,--when our Lord might have\nsanctified it at once, the moment He came near it?  How is it, I\nask again, that the same Lord brings it to the perfection of\nvirtue only in the course of time?  I should be glad to learn the\nreason, for I know it not.  I do know, however, that in the\nbeginning, when a trance lasts only the twinkling of an eye, and\nis almost imperceptible but for the effects it produces, the\ndegree of strength which God then gives is very different from\nthat which He gives when this grace is a trance of\nlonger duration.\n23. Very often, when thinking of this, have I imagined the reason\nmight be, that the soul does not despise itself all at once, till\nour Lord instructs it by degrees, and makes it resolute, and\ngives it the strength of manhood, so that it may trample utterly\nupon everything.  He gave this strength to the Magdalene in a\nmoment.  He gives the same grace to others, according to the\nmeasure of their abandonment of themselves into the hands of His\nMajesty, that He may do with them as He will. We never thoroughly\nbelieve that God rewards a hundredfold even in this life. [24]\n24. I also thought of this comparison: supposing grace given to\nthose who are far advanced to be the same with that given to\nthose who are but beginners, we may then liken it to a certain\nfood of which many persons partake: they who eat a little retain\nthe savour of it for a moment, they who eat more are nourished by\nit, but those who eat much receive life and strength.  Now, the\nsoul may eat so frequently and so abundantly of this food of life\nas to have no pleasure in eating any other food, because it sees\nhow much good it derives from it.  Its taste is now so formed\nupon it, that it would rather not live than have to eat any other\nfood; for all food but this has no other effect than to take away\nthe sweet savour which this good food leaves behind.\n25. Further, the conversation of good people does not profit us\nin one day as much as it does in many; and we may converse with\nthem long enough to become like them, by the grace of God.\nIn short, the whole matter is as His Majesty wills.  He gives His\ngrace to whom He pleases; but much depends on this: he who begins\nto receive this grace must make a firm resolution to detach\nhimself from all things, and esteem this grace according\nto reason.\n26. It seems also to me as if His Majesty were going about to try\nthose who love Him,--now one, now another,--revealing Himself in\nsupreme joy, so as to quicken our belief, if it should be dead,\nin what He will give us, saying, Behold! this is but a drop of\nthe immense sea of blessings; for He leaves nothing undone for\nthose He loves; and as He sees them receive it, so He gives, and\nHe gives Himself.  He loves those who love Him.  Oh, how dear He\nis!--how good a Friend!  O my soul's Lord, who can find words to\ndescribe what Thou givest to those who trust in Thee, and what\nthey lose who come to this state, and yet dwell in themselves!\nOh, let not this be so, O my Lord! for Thou doest more than this\nwhen Thou comest to a lodging so mean as mine.  Blessed be Thou\nfor ever and ever!\n27. I now humbly ask you, my father, if you mean to discuss what\nI have written on prayer with spiritual persons, to see that they\nare so really; for if they be persons who know only one way, or\nwho have stood still midway, they will not be able to understand\nthe matter.  There are also some whom God leads at once by the\nhighest way; these think that others might advance in the same\nmanner--quiet the understanding, and make bodily objects none of\ntheir means; but these people will remain dry as a stick.\nOthers, also, there are who, having for a moment attained to the\nprayer of quiet, think forthwith that, as they have had the one,\nso they may have the other.  These instead of advancing, go back,\nas I said before. [25]  So, throughout, experience and discretion\nare necessary.  May our Lord, of His goodness, bestow them on us!\n1.

I shall now return to that point in my life where I broke\noff, [1] having made, I believe, a longer digression than I need\nhave made, in order that what is still to come may be more\nclearly understood.  Henceforth, it is another and a new book,--I\nmean, another and a new life.  Hitherto, my life was my own; my\nlife, since I began to explain these methods of prayer, is the\nlife which God lived in me,--so it seems to me; for I feel it to\nbe impossible that I should have escaped in so short a time from\nways and works that were so wicked.  May our Lord be praised, who\nhas delivered me from myself!\n2. When, then, I began to avoid the occasions of sin, and to give\nmyself more unto prayer, our Lord also began to bestow His graces\nupon me, as one who desired, so it seemed, that I too should be\nwilling to receive them.  His Majesty began to give me most\nfrequently the grace of the prayer of quiet, and very often that\nof union, which lasted some time.  But as, in these days, women\nhave fallen into great delusions and deceits of Satan, [2] I\nbegan to be afraid, because the joy and sweetness which I felt\nwere so great, and very often beyond my power to avoid.  On the\nother hand, I felt in myself a very deep conviction that God was\nwith me, especially when I was in prayer.  I saw, too, that I\ngrew better and stronger thereby.\n3. But if I was a little distracted, I began to be afraid, and to\nimagine that perhaps it was Satan that suspended my\nunderstanding, making me think it to be good, in order to\nwithdraw me from mental prayer, hinder my meditation on the\nPassion, and debar me the use of my understanding: this seemed to\nme, who did not comprehend the matter, to be a grievous loss but,\nas His Majesty was pleased to give me light to offend Him no\nmore, and to understand how much I owed Him, this fear so grew\nupon me, that it made me seek diligently for spiritual persons\nwith whom I might treat of my state.  I had already heard of\nsome; for the Fathers of the Society of Jesus had come\nhither; [3] and I, though I knew none of them, was greatly\nattracted by them, merely because I had heard of their way of\nlife and of prayer; but I did not think myself fit to speak to\nthem, or strong enough to obey them; and this made me still more\nafraid; for to converse with them, and remain what I was, seemed\nto me somewhat rude.\n4. I spent some time in this state, till, after much inward\ncontention and fear, I determined to confer with some spiritual\nperson, to ask him to tell me what that method of prayer was\nwhich I was using, and to show me whether I was in error.  I was\nalso resolved to do everything I could not to offend God; for the\nwant of courage of which I was conscious, as I said before, [4]\nmade me so timid.  Was there ever delusion so great as mine, O my\nGod, when I withdrew from good in order to become good!\nThe devil must lay much stress on this in the beginning of a\ncourse of virtue; for I could not overcome my repugnance.\nHe knows that the whole relief of the soul consists in conferring\nwith the friends of God.  Hence it was that no time was fixed in\nwhich I should resolve to do this.  I waited to grow better\nfirst, as I did before when I ceased to pray, [5]--and perhaps I\nnever should have become better; for I had now sunk so deeply\ninto the petty ways of an evil habit,--I could not convince\nmyself that they were wrong,--that I needed the help of others,\nwho should hold out a hand to raise me up.  Blessed be Thou, O\nLord!--for the first hand outstretched to me was Thine.\n5. When I saw that my fear was going so far, it struck\nme--because I was making progress in prayer--that this must be a\ngreat blessing, or a very great evil; for I understood perfectly\nthat what had happened was something supernatural, because at\ntimes I was unable to withstand it; to have it when I would was\nalso impossible.  I thought to myself that there was no help for\nit, but in keeping my conscience pure, avoiding every occasion\neven of venial sins; for if it was the work of the Spirit of God,\nthe gain was clear; and if the work of Satan, so long as I strove\nto please, and did not offend, our Lord, Satan could do me little\nharm; on the contrary, he must lose in the struggle.\nDetermined on this course, and always praying God to help me,\nstriving also after purity of conscience for some days, I saw\nthat my soul had not strength to go forth alone to a perfection\nso great.  I had certain attachments to trifles, which, though\nnot very wrong in themselves, were yet enough to ruin all.\n6. I was told of a learned ecclesiastic, [6] dwelling in this\ncity, whose goodness and pious life our Lord was beginning to\nmake known to the world.  I contrived to make his acquaintance\nthrough a saintly nobleman [7] living in the same place.\nThis latter is a married man; but his life is so edifying and\nvirtuous, so given to prayer, and so full of charity, that the\ngoodness and perfection of it shine forth in all he does: and\nmost justly so; for many souls have been greatly blessed through\nhim, because of his great gifts, which, though his condition of a\nlayman be a hindrance to him, never lie idle.  He is a man of\ngreat sense, and very gentle with all people; his conversation is\nnever wearisome, but so sweet and gracious, as well as upright\nand holy, that he pleases everybody very much with whom he has\nany relations.  He directs it all to the great good of those\nsouls with whom he converses and he seems to have no other end in\nview but to do all he may be permitted to do for all men, and\nmake them content.\n7. This blessed and holy man, then, seems to me, by the pains he\ntook, to have been the beginning of salvation to my soul.\nHis humility in his relations with me makes me wonder; for he had\nspent, I believe, nearly forty years in prayer,--it may be two or\nthree years less,--and all his life was ordered with that\nperfection which his state admitted.  His wife is so great a\nservant of God, and so full of charity, that nothing is lost to\nhim on her account, [8]--in short, she was the chosen wife of one\nwho God knew would serve Him so well.  Some of their kindred are\nmarried to some of mine.  Besides, I had also much communication\nwith another great servant of God, married to one of my\nfirst cousins.\n8. It was thus I contrived that the ecclesiastic I speak of, who\nwas so great a servant of God, and his great friend, should come\nto speak to me, intending to confess to him, and to take him for\nmy director.  When he had brought him to speak to me, I, in the\ngreatest confusion at finding myself in the presence of so holy a\nman, revealed to him the state of my soul, and my way of prayer.\nHe would not be my confessor; he said that he was very much\noccupied: and so, indeed, he was.  He began with a holy\nresolution to direct me as if I was strong,--I ought to have been\nstrong, according to the method of prayer which he saw I\nused,--so that I should in nothing offend God.  When I saw that\nhe was resolved to make me break off at once with the petty ways\nI spoke of before, [9] and that I had not the courage to go forth\nat once in the perfection he required of me, I was distressed;\nand when I perceived that he ordered the affairs of my soul as if\nI ought to be perfect at once, I saw that much more care was\nnecessary in my case.  In a word, I felt that the means he would\nhave employed were not those by which my soul could be helped\nonwards; for they were fitted for a soul more perfect than mine;\nand though the graces I had received from God were very many, I\nwas still at the very beginning in the matter of virtue and\nof mortification.\n9. I believe certainly, if I had only had this ecclesiastic to\nconfer with, that my soul would have made no progress; for the\npain it gave me to see that I was not doing--and, as I thought,\ncould not do--what he told me, was enough to destroy all hope,\nand make me abandon the matter altogether.  I wonder at times how\nit was that he, being one who had a particular grace for the\ndirection of beginners in the way of God, was not permitted to\nunderstand my case, or to undertake the care of my soul.  I see\nit was all for my greater good, in order that I might know and\nconverse with persons so holy as the members of the Society\nof Jesus.\n10. After this, I arranged with that saintly nobleman that he\nshould come and see me now and then.  It shows how deep his\nhumility was; for he consented to converse with a person so\nwicked as I was.  He began his visits, he encouraged me, and told\nme that I ought not to suppose I could give up everything in one\nday; God would bring it about by degrees: he himself had for some\nyears been unable to free himself from some very slight\nimperfections.  O humility! what great blessings thou bringest to\nthose in whom thou dwellest, and to them who draw near to those\nwho possess thee!  This holy man--for I think I may justly call\nhim so--told me of weaknesses of his own, in order to help me.\nHe, in his humility, thought them weaknesses; but, if we consider\nhis state, they were neither faults nor imperfections; yet, in my\nstate, it was a very great fault to be subject to them.\n11. I am not saying this without a meaning, though I seem to be\nenlarging on trifles; but these trifles contribute so much\ntowards the beginning of the soul's progress and its flight\nupwards, though it has no wings, as they say; and yet no one will\nbelieve it who has not had experience of it; but, as I hope in\nGod that your reverence will help many a soul, I speak of it\nhere.  My whole salvation depended on his knowing how to treat\nme, on his humility, on the charity with which he conversed with\nme, and on his patient endurance of me when he saw that I did not\nmend my ways at once.  He went on discreetly, by degrees showing\nme how to overcome Satan.  My affection for him so grew upon me,\nthat I never was more at ease than on the day I used to see him.\nI saw him, however, very rarely.  When he was long in coming, I\nused to be very much distressed, thinking that he would not see\nme because I was so wicked.\n12. When he found out my great imperfections, they might well\nhave been sins, though since I conversed with him I am somewhat\nimproved,--and when I recounted to him, in order to obtain light\nfrom him, the great graces which God had bestowed upon me, he\ntold me that these things were inconsistent one with another;\nthat these consolations were given to people who had made great\nprogress, and led mortified lives; that he could not help being\nvery much afraid--he thought that the evil spirit might have\nsomething to do in my case; he would not decide that question,\nhowever, but he would have me carefully consider my whole method\nof prayer, and then tell him of it.  That was the difficulty: I\ndid not understand it myself, and so I could tell him nothing of\nmy prayer; for the grace to understand it--and, understanding it,\nto describe it--has only lately been given me of God.\nThis saying of his, together with the fear I was in, distressed\nme exceedingly, and I cried; for certainly I was anxious to\nplease God, and I could not persuade myself that Satan had\nanything to do with it.  But I was afraid, on account of my great\nsins, that God might leave me blind, so that I should\nunderstand nothing.\n13. Looking into books to see if I could find anything there by\nwhich I might recognise the prayer I practised, I found in one of\nthem, called the Ascent of the Mount, [10] and in that part of it\nwhich relates to the union of the soul with God, all those marks\nwhich I had in myself, in that I could not think of anything.\nThis is what I most dwelt on--that I could think of nothing when\nI was in prayer.  I marked that passage, and gave him the book,\nthat he, and the ecclesiastic mentioned before, [11] saint and\nservant of God, might consider it, and tell me what I should do.\nIf they thought it right, I would give up that method of prayer\naltogether; for why should I expose myself to danger, when, at\nthe end of nearly twenty years, during which I had used it, I had\ngained nothing, but had fallen into a delusion of the devil?\nIt was better for me to give it up.  And yet this seemed to me\nhard; for I had already discovered what my soul would become\nwithout prayer.  Everything seemed full of trouble.  I was like a\nperson in the middle of a river, who, in whatever direction he\nmay turn, fears a still greater danger, and is well-nigh drowned.\nThis is a very great trial, and I have gone through many like it,\nas I shall show hereafter; [12] and though it does not seem to be\nof any importance, it will perhaps be advantageous to understand\nhow the spirit is to be tried.\n14. And certainly the affliction to be borne is great, and\ncaution is necessary, particularly in the case of women,--for our\nweakness is great,--and much evil may be the result of telling\nthem very distinctly that the devil is busy with them; yea,\nrather, the matter should be very carefully considered, and they\nshould be removed out of reach of the dangers that may arise.\nThey should be advised to keep things secret; and it is\nnecessary, also, that their secret should be kept.  I am speaking\nof this as one to whom it has been a sore trouble; for some of\nthose with whom I spoke of my prayer did not keep my secret, but,\nmaking inquiries one of another, for a good purpose, did me much\nharm; for they made things known which might well have remained\nsecret, because not intended for every one and it seemed as if I\nhad made them public myself. [13]\n15. I believe that our Lord permitted [14] this to be done\nwithout sin on their part, in order that I might suffer.  I do\nnot say that they revealed anything I discussed with them in\nconfession; still, as they were persons to whom, in my fears, I\ngave a full account of myself, in order that they might give me\nlight, I thought they ought to have been silent.  Nevertheless, I\nnever dared to conceal anything from such persons.  My meaning,\nthen, is, that women should be directed with much discretion;\ntheir directors should encourage them, and bide the time when our\nLord will help them, as He has helped me.  If He had not, the\ngreatest harm would have befallen me, for I was in great fear and\ndread; and as I suffered from disease of the heart, [15] I am\nastonished that all this did not do me a great deal of harm.\n16. Then, when I had given him the book, and told the story of my\nlife and of my sins, the best way I could in general,--for I was\nnot in confession, because he was a layman; yet I gave him\nclearly to understand how wicked I was,--those two servants of\nGod, with great charity and affection, considered what was best\nfor me.  When they had made up their minds what to say,--I was\nwaiting for it in great dread, having begged many persons to pray\nto God for me, and I too had prayed much during those days,--the\nnobleman came to me in great distress, and said that, in the\nopinion of both, I was deluded by an evil spirit; that the best\nthing for me to do was to apply to a certain father of the\nSociety of Jesus, who would come to me if I sent for him, saying\nI had need of him; that I ought, in a general confession, to give\nhim an account of my whole life, and of the state I was in,--and\nall with great clearness: God would, in virtue of the Sacrament\nof Confession, give him more light concerning me; for those\nfathers were very experienced men in matters of spirituality.\nFurther, I was not to swerve in a single point from the counsels\nof that father; for I was in great danger, if I had no one to\ndirect me.\n17. This answer so alarmed and distressed me, that I knew not\nwhat to do--I did nothing but cry.  Being in an oratory in great\naffliction, not knowing what would become of me, I read in a\nbook--it seemed as if our Lord had put it into my hands--that\nSt. Paul said, God is faithful; [16] that He will never permit\nSatan to deceive those who love Him.  This gave me great\nconsolation. I began to prepare for my general confession, and to\nwrite out all the evil and all the good: a history of my life, as\nclearly as I understood it, and knew how to make it, omitting\nnothing whatever.  I remember, when I saw I had written so much\nevil, and scarcely anything that was good, that I was exceedingly\ndistressed and sorrowful.  It pained me, also, that the nuns of\nthe community should see me converse with such holy persons as\nthose of the Society of Jesus; for I was afraid of my own\nwickedness, and I thought I should be obliged to cease from it,\nand give up my amusements; and that if I did not do so, I should\ngrow worse: so I persuaded the sacristan and the portress to tell\nno one of it.  This was of little use, after all; for when I was\ncalled down there was one at the door, as it happened, who told\nit to the whole convent.  But what difficulties and what terrors\nSatan troubles them with who would draw near unto God!\n18. I communicated the whole state of my soul to that servant of\nGod [17] and he was a great servant of His, and very prudent.\nHe understood all I told him, explained it to me, and encouraged\nme greatly.  He said that all was very evidently the work of the\nSpirit of God; only it was necessary for me to go back again to\nmy prayer, because I was not well grounded, and had not begun to\nunderstand what mortification meant,--that was true, for I do not\nthink I knew it even by name,--that I was by no means to give up\nprayer; on the contrary, I was to do violence to myself in order\nto practise it, because God had bestowed on me such special\ngraces as made it impossible to say whether it was, or was not,\nthe will of our Lord to do good to many through me. He went\nfurther, for he seems to have prophesied of that which our Lord\nafterwards did with me, and said that I should be very much to\nblame if I did not correspond with the graces which God bestowed\nupon me.  It seems to me that the Holy Ghost was speaking by his\nmouth in order to heal my soul, so deep was the impression he\nmade.  He made me very much ashamed of myself, and directed me by\na way which seemed to change me altogether.  What a grand thing\nit is to understand a soul!  He told me to make my prayer every\nday on some mystery of the Passion, and that I should profit by\nit, and to fix my thoughts on the Sacred Humanity only, resisting\nto the utmost of my power those recollections and delights, to\nwhich I was not to yield in any way till he gave me further\ndirections in the matter.\n19. He left me consoled and fortified: our Lord came to my\nsuccour and to his, so that he might understand the state I was\nin, and how he was to direct me.  I made a firm resolution not to\nswerve from anything he might command me, and to this day I have\nkept it.  Our Lord be praised, who has given me grace to be\nobedient to my confessors, [18] however imperfectly!--and they\nhave almost always been those blessed men of the Society of\nJesus; though, as I said, I have but imperfectly obeyed them.\nMy soul began to improve visibly, as I am now going to say.\n1.

Her Inability to Resist the Graces\nof God.  God Multiplies His Graces.\n1. After this my confession, my soul was so docile that, as it\nseems to me, there was nothing in the world I was not prepared to\nundertake.  I began at once to make a change in many things,\nthough my confessor never pressed me--on the contrary, he seemed\nto make light of it all.  I was the more influenced by this,\nbecause he led me on by the way of the love of God; he left me\nfree, and did not press me, unless I did so myself, out of love.\nI continued thus nearly two months, doing all I could to resist\nthe sweetness and graces that God sent.  As to my outward life,\nthe change was visible; for our Lord gave me courage to go\nthrough with certain things, of which those who knew me--and even\nthose in the community--said that they seemed to them extreme;\nand, indeed, compared with what I had been accustomed to do, they\nwere extreme: people, therefore, had reason to say so.  Yet, in\nthose things which were of obligation, considering the habit I\nwore, and the profession I had made, I was still deficient.\nBy resisting the sweetness and joys which God sent me, I gained\nthis, that His Majesty taught me Himself; for, previously, I used\nto think that, in order to obtain sweetness in prayer, it was\nnecessary for me to hide myself in secret places, and so I\nscarcely dared to stir.  Afterwards, I saw how little that was to\nthe purpose; for the more I tried to distract myself, the more\nour Lord poured over me that sweetness and joy which seemed to me\nto be flowing around me, so that I could not in any way escape\nfrom it: and so it was.  I was so careful about this resistance,\nthat it was a pain to me.  But our Lord was more careful to show\nHis mercies, and during those two months to reveal Himself more\nthan before, so that I might the better comprehend that it was no\nlonger in my power to resist Him.\n2. I began with a renewed love of the most Sacred Humanity; my\nprayer began to be solid, like a house, the foundations of which\nare strong; and I was inclined to practise greater penance,\nhaving been negligent in this matter hitherto because of my great\ninfirmities.  The holy man who heard my confession told me that\ncertain penances would not hurt me, and that God perhaps sent me\nso much sickness because I did no penance; His Majesty would\ntherefore impose it Himself.  He ordered me to practise certain\nacts of mortification not very pleasant for me. [1] I did so,\nbecause I felt that our Lord was enjoining it all, and giving him\ngrace to command me in such a way as to make me obedient\nunto him.\n3. My soul was now sensitive to every offence I committed against\nGod, however slight it might be; so much so, that if I had any\nsuperfluity about me, I could not recollect myself in prayer till\nI had got rid of it.  I prayed earnestly that our Lord would hold\nme by the hand, and not suffer me to fall again, now that I was\nunder the direction of His servants.  I thought that would be a\ngreat evil, and that they would lose their credit through me.\n4. At this time, Father Francis, who was Duke of Gandia, [2] came\nhere; he had left all he possessed some years before, and had\nentered the Society of Jesus.  My confessor, and the nobleman of\nwhom I spoke before, [3] contrived that he should visit me, in\norder that I might speak to him, and give him an account of my\nway of prayer; for they knew him to be greatly favoured and\ncomforted of God: he had given up much, and was rewarded for it\neven in this life.  When he had heard me, he said to me that it\nwas the work of the Spirit of God, [4] and that he thought it was\nnot right now to prolong that resistance; that hitherto it had\nbeen safe enough,--only, I should always begin my prayer by\nmeditating on some part of the Passion and that if our Lord\nshould then raise up my spirit, I should make no resistance, but\nsuffer His Majesty to raise it upwards, I myself not seeking it.\nHe gave both medicine and advice, as one who had made great\nprogress himself; for experience is very important in these\nmatters.  He said that further resistance would be a mistake.\nI was exceedingly consoled; so, too, was the nobleman, who\nrejoiced greatly when he was told that it was the work of God.\nHe always helped me and gave me advice according to his\npower,--and that power was great.\n5. At this time, they changed my confessor's residence.  I felt\nit very much, for I thought I should go back to my wickedness,\nand that it was not possible to find another such as he.  My soul\nwas, as it were, in a desert, most sorrowful and afraid.  I knew\nnot what to do with myself.  One of my kinswomen contrived to get\nme into her house, and I contrived at once to find another\nconfessor, [5] in the Society of Jesus.  It pleased our Lord that\nI should commence a friendship with a noble lady, [6] a widow,\nmuch given to prayer, who had much to do with the fathers.\nShe made her own confessor [7] hear me, and I remained in her\nhouse some days.  She lived near, and I delighted in the many\nconferences I had with the fathers; for merely by observing the\nholiness of their way of life, I felt that my soul\nprofited exceedingly.\n6. This father began by putting me in the way of greater\nperfection.  He used to say to me, that I ought to leave nothing\nundone that I might be wholly pleasing unto God.  He was,\nhowever, very prudent and very gentle at the same time; for my\nsoul was not at all strong, but rather very weak, especially as\nto giving up certain friendships, though I did not offend God by\nthem: there was much natural affection in them, and I thought it\nwould be an act of ingratitude if I broke them off.  And so, as I\ndid not offend God, I asked him if I must be ungrateful.  He told\nme to lay the matter before God for a few days, and recite the\nhymn, \"Veni, Creator,\" that God might enlighten me as to the\nbetter course.  One day, having prayed for some time, and\nimplored our Lord to help me to please Him in all things, I began\nthe hymn; and as I was saying it, I fell into a trance--so\nsuddenly, that I was, as it were, carried out of myself.  I could\nhave no doubt about it, for it was most plain.\n7. This was the first time that our Lord bestowed on me the grace\nof ecstasy.  I heard these words: \"I will not have thee converse\nwith men, but with angels.\"  This made me wonder very much; for\nthe commotion of my spirit was great, and these words were\nuttered in the very depth of my soul.  They made me\nafraid,--though, on the other hand, they gave me great comfort,\nwhich, when I had lost the fear,--caused, I believe, by the\nstrangeness of the visitation,--remained with me.\n8. Those words have been fulfilled; for I have never been able to\nform friendship with, nor have any comfort in, nor any particular\nlove for, any persons whatever except those who, as I believe,\nlove God, and who strive to serve Him.  It has not been in my\npower to do it.  It is nothing to me that they are my kindred, or\nmy friends, if I do not know them to be lovers of God, or persons\ngiven to prayer.  It is to me a painful cross to converse with\nany one.  This is the truth, so far as I can judge. [8]\nFrom that day forth, I have had courage so great as to leave all\nthings for God, who in one moment--and it seems to me but a\nmoment--was pleased to change His servant into another person.\nAccordingly, there was no necessity for laying further commands\nupon me in this matter.  When my confessor saw how much I clung\nto these friendships, he did not venture to bid me distinctly to\ngive them up.  He must have waited till our Lord did the work--as\nHe did Himself.  Nor did I think myself that I could succeed; for\nI had tried before, and the pain it gave me was so great that I\nabandoned the attempt, on the ground that there was nothing\nunseemly in those attachments.  Now our Lord set me at liberty,\nand gave me strength also to use it.\n9. So I told my confessor of it, and gave up everything,\naccording to his advice.  It did a great deal of good to those\nwith whom I used to converse, to see my determination.  God be\nblessed for ever! Who in one moment set me free, while I had been\nfor many years making many efforts, and had never succeeded, very\noften also doing such violence to myself as injured my health;\nbut, as it was done by Him Who is almighty, and the true Lord of\nall, it gave me no pain whatever.\n1. The Saint now treated her body with extreme severity,\ndisciplining herself even unto blood (Reforma, vol. i. lib. i. c.\nxx. \u00a7\u00a04).\n2. St. Francis de Borja came to Avila, where St. Teresa lived, in\n1557 (De la Fuente).

Ferdinand Alvarez,\nwho became her confessor on the removal of F. Juan de Padranos,\nand that it was to him she confessed till she placed herself\nunder the direction of F. Baltasar Alvarez, the confessor of Do\u00f1a\nGuiomar, as it is stated in the next paragraph,--unless the\nconfessor there mentioned was F.\u00a0Ferdinand.\n6. Do\u00f1a Guiomar de Ulloa.  See below, ch. xxxii. \u00a7 13.\n7. If this confessor was F. Baltasar Alvarez, the Saint, F. Bouix\nobserves, passes rapidly over the history of the year 1557, and\nthe greater part, perhaps, of 1558; for F. Baltasar was ordained\npriest only in the latter\u00a0year.\n8. See Relation, i. \u00a7 6.\nChapter XXV.\nDivine Locutions.  Discussions on That Subject.\n1. It will be as well, I think, to explain these locutions of\nGod, and to describe what the soul feels when it receives them,\nin order that you, my father, may understand the matter; for ever\nsince that time of which I am speaking, when our Lord granted me\nthat grace, it has been an ordinary occurrence until now, as will\nappear by what I have yet to say. [1]\n2. The words are very distinctly formed; but by the bodily ear\nthey are not heard.  They are, however, much more clearly\nunderstood than they would be if they were heard by the ear.\nIt is impossible not to understand them, whatever resistance we\nmay offer.  When we wish not to hear anything in this world, we\ncan stop our ears, or give attention to something else: so that,\neven if we do hear, at least we can refuse to understand.\nIn this locution of God addressed to the soul there is no escape,\nfor in spite of ourselves we must listen; and the understanding\nmust apply itself so thoroughly to the comprehension of that\nwhich God wills we should hear, that it is nothing to the purpose\nwhether we will it or not; for it is His will, Who can do all\nthings.  We should understand that His will must be done; and He\nreveals Himself as our true Lord, having dominion over us.\nI know this by much experience; for my resistance lasted nearly\ntwo years, [2] because of the great fear I was in: and even now I\nresist occasionally; but it is of no use.\n3. I should like to explain the delusions which may happen here,\nthough he who has had much experience will run little or no risk,\nI think; but the experience must be great.  I should like to\nexplain also how those locutions which come from the Good Spirit\ndiffer from those which come from an evil spirit; and, further,\nhow they may be but an apprehension of the understanding,--for\nthat is possible,--or even words which the mind addressed to\nitself.  I do not know if it be so but even this very day I\nthought it possible.  I know by experience in many ways, when\nthese locutions come from God.  I have been told things two or\nthree years beforehand, which have all come to pass; and in none\nof them have I been hitherto deceived.  There are also other\nthings in which the Spirit of God may be clearly traced, as I\nshall relate by and by. [3]\n4. It seems to me that a person commending a matter to God with\ngreat love and earnestness may think that he hears in some way or\nother whether his prayer will be granted or not, and this is\nquite possible; but he who has heard the divine locution will see\nclearly enough what this is, because there is a great difference\nbetween the two.  If it be anything which the understanding has\nfashioned, however cunningly it may have done so, he sees that it\nis the understanding which has arranged that locution, and that\nit is speaking of itself.  This is nothing else but a word\nuttered by one, and listened to by another: in that case, the\nunderstanding will see that it has not been listening only, but\nalso forming the words; and the words it forms are something\nindistinct, fantastic, and not clear like the divine locutions.\nIt is in our power to turn away our attention from these\nlocutions of our own, just as we can be silent when we are\nspeaking; but, with respect to the former, that cannot be done.\n5. There is another test more decisive still.  The words formed\nby the understanding effect nothing; but, when our Lord speaks,\nit is at once word and work; and though the words may not be\nmeant to stir up our devotion, but are rather words of reproof,\nthey dispose a soul at once, strengthen it, make it tender, give\nit light, console and calm it; and if it should be in dryness, or\nin trouble and uneasiness, all is removed, as if by the action of\na hand, and even better; for it seems as if our Lord would have\nthe soul understand that He is all-powerful, and that His words\nare deeds.\n6. It seems to me that there is as much difference between these\ntwo locutions as there is between speaking and listening, neither\nmore nor less; for when I speak, as I have just said, [4] I go on\nwith my understanding arranging what I am saying; but if I am\nspoken to by others, I do nothing else but listen, without any\nlabour.  The human locution is as something which we cannot well\nmake out, as if we were half asleep; but the divine locution is a\nvoice so clear that not a syllable of its utterance is lost.\nIt may occur, too, when the understanding and the soul are so\ntroubled and distracted that they cannot form one sentence\ncorrectly; and yet grand sentences, perfectly arranged, such as\nthe soul in its most recollected state never could have formed,\nare uttered, and at the first word, as I said, [5] change it\nutterly.  Still less could it have formed them if they are\nuttered in an ecstasy, when the faculties of the soul are\nsuspended; for how should the soul then comprehend anything, when\nit remembers nothing?--yea, rather, how can it remember them\nthen, when the memory can hardly do anything at all, and the\nimagination is, as it were, suspended?\n7. But it is to be observed, that if we see visions and hear\nwords it never is as at the time when the soul is in union in the\nvery rapture itself,--so it seems to me.  At that moment, as I\nhave shown,--I think it was when I was speaking of the second\nwater, [6]--all the faculties of the soul are suspended; and, as\nI think, neither vision, nor understanding, nor hearing, is\npossible at that time.  The soul is then wholly in the power of\nanother; and in that instant--a very brief one, in my\nopinion--our Lord leaves it free for nothing whatever; but when\nthis instant is passed, the soul continuing still entranced, then\nis the time of which I am speaking; for the faculties, though not\ncompletely suspended, are so disposed that they are scarcely\nactive, being, as it were, absorbed, and incapable of making\nany reflections.\n8. There are so many ways of ascertaining the nature of these\nlocutions, that if a person be once deceived, he will not be\ndeceived often.  I mean, that a soul accustomed to them, and on\nits guard, will most clearly see what they are; for, setting\nother considerations aside which prove what I have said, the\nhuman locution produces no effect, neither does the soul accept\nit,--though it must admit the other, whether we like it or\nnot,--nor does it believe it; on the contrary, it is known to be\na delusion of the understanding, and is therefore put away as we\nwould put away the ravings of a lunatic.\n9. But as to the divine locution, we listen to that as we do to a\nperson of great holiness, learning, or authority, whom we know to\nbe incapable of uttering a falsehood.  And yet this is an\ninadequate illustration; for these locutions proceed occasionally\nin such great majesty that, without our recollecting who it is\nthat utters them, they make us tremble if they be words of\nreproof, and die of love if words of love.  They are also, as I\nhave said, [7] matters of which the memory has not the least\nrecollection; and expressions so full are uttered so rapidly,\nthat much time must have been spent in arranging them, if we\nformed them ourselves; and so it seems to me that we cannot\npossibly be ignorant at the time that we have never formed them\nourselves at all.\n10. There is no reason, therefore, why I should dwell longer on\nthis matter.  It is a wonder to me that any experienced person,\nunless he deliberately chooses to do so, can fall into delusions.\nIt has often happened to me, when I had doubts, to distrust what\nI had heard, and to think that it was all imagination,--but this\nI did afterwards: for at the moment that is impossible,--and at a\nlater time to see the whole fulfilled; for our Lord makes the\nwords dwell in the memory so that they cannot be forgotten.\nNow, that which comes forth from our understanding is, as it\nwere, the first movement of thought, which passes away and is\nforgotten; but the divine locution is a work done; and though\nsome of it may be forgotten, and time have lapsed, yet is not so\nwholly forgotten that the memory loses all traces of what was\nonce spoken,--unless, indeed, after very long time, or unless the\nlocution were words of grace or of instruction.  But as to\nprophetic words, they are never forgotten, in my opinion; at\nleast, I have never forgotten any,--and yet my memory is weak.\n11. I repeat it, unless a soul be so wicked as to pretend that it\nhas these locutions, which would be a great sin, and say that it\nhears divine words when it hears nothing of the kind, it cannot\npossibly fail to see clearly that itself arranges the words, and\nutters them to itself.  That seems to me altogether impossible\nfor any soul that has ever known the Spirit of God.  If it has\nnot, it may continue all its life long in this delusion, and\nimagine that it hears and understands, though I know not how that\ncan be.  A soul desires to hear these locutions, or it does not;\nif it does not, it is distressed because it hears them, and is\nunwilling to listen to them, because of a thousand fears which\nthey occasion, and for many other reasons it has for being quiet\nin prayer without these interruptions.  How is it that the\nunderstanding has time enough to arrange these locutions?\nThey require time.\n12. But, on the other side, the divine locutions instruct us\nwithout loss of time, and we understand matters which seem to\nrequire a month on our part to arrange.  The understanding\nitself, and the soul, stand amazed at some of the things we\nunderstand.  So it is; and he who has any experience of it will\nsee that what I am saying is literally true.  I give God thanks\nthat I have been able thus to explain it.  I end by saying that,\nin my opinion, we may hear the locutions that proceed from the\nunderstanding whenever we like, and think that we hear them\nwhenever we pray.  But it is not so with the divine locutions:\nfor many days I may desire to hear them, and I cannot; and at\nother times, even when I would not, as I said before, [8] hear\nthem, I must.  It seems to me that any one disposed to deceive\npeople by saying that he heard from God that which he has\ninvented himself, might as easily say that he heard it with his\nbodily ears.  It is most certainly true that I never imagined\nthere was any other way of hearing or understanding till I had\nproof of it in myself; and so, as I have said before, [9] it gave\nme trouble enough.\n13. Locutions that come from Satan not only do not leave any good\neffects behind, but do leave evil effects.  This has happened to\nme; but not more than two or three times.  Our Lord warned me at\nonce that they came from Satan.  Over and above the great aridity\nwhich remains in the soul after these evil locutions, there is\nalso a certain disquiet, such as I have had on many other\noccasions, when, by our Lord's permission, I fell into great\ntemptations and travail of soul in diverse ways; and though I am\nin trouble often enough, as I shall show hereafter, [10] yet this\ndisquiet is such that I know not whence it comes; only the soul\nseems to resist, is troubled and distressed, without knowing why;\nfor the words of Satan are good, and not evil.  I am thinking\nwhether this may not be so because one spirit is conscious of the\npresence of another.\n14. The sweetness and joy which Satan gives are, in my opinion,\nof a very different kind.  By means of these sweetnesses he may\ndeceive any one who does not, or who never did, taste of the\nsweetness of God,--by which I mean a certain sweet, strong,\nimpressive, delightsome, and calm refreshing.  Those little,\nfervid bursts of tears, and other slight emotions,--for at the\nfirst breath of persecution these flowers wither,--I do not call\ndevotion, though they are a good beginning, and are holy\nimpressions; but they are not a test to determine whether these\nlocutions come from a good or an evil spirit.  It is therefore\nbest for us to proceed always with great caution; for those\npersons who have advanced in prayer only so far as this may most\neasily fall into delusions, if they have visions or revelations.\nFor myself, I never had a single vision or revelation till God\nhad led me on to the prayer of union,--unless it be on that\noccasion, of which I have spoken before, [11] now many years ago,\nwhen I saw our Lord.  Oh, that His Majesty had been pleased to\nlet me then understand that it was a true vision, as I have since\nunderstood it was! it would have been no slight blessing to me.\n15. After these locutions of the evil one, the soul is never\ngentle, but is, as it were, terrified, and greatly disgusted.\n16. I look upon it as a most certain truth, that the devil will\nnever deceive, and that God will not suffer him to deceive, the\nsoul which has no confidence whatever in itself; which is strong\nin faith, and resolved to undergo a thousand deaths for any one\narticle of the creed; which in its love of the faith, infused of\nGod once for all,--a faith living and strong,--always labours,\nseeking for further light on this side and on that, to mould\nitself on the teaching of the Church, as one already deeply\ngrounded in the truth.  No imaginable revelations, not even if it\nsaw the heavens open, could make that soul swerve in any degree\nfrom the doctrine of the Church.  If, however, it should at any\ntime find itself wavering even in thought on this point, or\nstopping to say to itself, If God says this to me, it may be\ntrue, as well as what He said to the Saints--the soul must not be\nsure of it.  I do not mean that it so believes, only that Satan\nhas taken the first step towards tempting it; and the giving way\nto the first movements of a thought like this is evidently most\nwrong.  I believe, however, that these first movements will not\ntake place if the soul is so strong in the matter--as that soul\nis to whom our Lord sends these graces--that it seems as if it\ncould crush the evil spirits in defence of the very least of the\ntruths which the Church holds.\n17. If the soul does not discern this great strength in itself,\nand if the particular devotion or vision help it not onwards,\nthen it must not look upon it as safe.  For though at first the\nsoul is conscious of no harm, great harm may by degrees ensue;\nbecause, so far as I can see, and by experience understand, that\nwhich purports to come from God is received only in so far as it\ncorresponds with the sacred writings; but if it varies therefrom\never so little, I am incomparably more convinced that it comes\nfrom Satan than I am now convinced it comes from God, however\ndeep that conviction may be.  In this case, there is no need to\nask for signs, nor from what spirit it proceeds, because this\nvarying is so clear a sign of the devil's presence, that if all\nthe world were to assure me that it came from God, I would not\nbelieve it.  The fact is, that all good seems to be lost out of\nsight, and to have fled from the soul, when the devil has spoken\nto it; the soul is thrown into a state of disgust, and is\ntroubled, able to do no good thing whatever--for if it conceives\ngood desires, they are not strong; its humility is fictitious,\ndisturbed, and without sweetness.  Any one who has ever tasted of\nthe Spirit of God will, I think, understand it.\n18. Nevertheless, Satan has many devices; and so there is nothing\nmore certain than that it is safer to be afraid, and always on\nour guard, under a learned director, from whom nothing is\nconcealed.  If we do this, no harm can befall us, though much has\nbefallen me through the excessive fears which possessed some\npeople.  For instance, it happened so once to me, when many\npersons in whom I had great confidence, and with good reason, had\nassembled together,--five or six in number, I think,--and all\nvery great servants of God.  It is true, my relations were with\none of them only; but by his orders made my state known to the\nothers.  They had many conferences together about my necessities;\nfor they had great affection for me, and were afraid I was under\na delusion.  I, too, was very much afraid whenever I was not\noccupied in prayer; but when I prayed, and our Lord bestowed His\ngraces upon me, I was instantly reassured.  My confessor told me\nthey were all of opinion that I was deceived by Satan; that I\nmust communicate less frequently, and contrive to distract myself\nin such a way as to be less alone.\n19. I was in great fear myself, as I have just said, and my\ndisease of the heart [12] contributed thereto, so that very often\nI did not dare to remain alone in my cell during the day.  When I\nfound so many maintain this, and myself unable to believe them, I\nhad at once a most grievous scruple; for it seemed to me that I\nhad very little humility, especially as they all led lives\nincomparably better than mine: they were also learned men.\nWhy should I not believe them?  I did all I could to believe\nthem.  I reflected on my wicked life, and therefore what they\nsaid to me must be true.\n20. In this distress, I quitted the church, [13] and entered an\noratory.  I had not been to Communion for many days, nor had I\nbeen alone, which was all my comfort.  I had no one to speak to,\nfor every one was against me.  Some, I thought, made a mock of me\nwhen I spoke to them of my prayer, as if I were a person under\ndelusions of the imagination; others warned my confessor to be on\nhis guard against me; and some said it was clear the whole was an\noperation of Satan.  My confessor, though he agreed with them for\nthe sake of trying me, as I understood afterwards, always\ncomforted me: and he alone did so.  He told me that, if I did not\noffend God, my prayer, even if it was the work of Satan, could do\nme no harm; that I should be delivered from it.  He bade me pray\nmuch to God: he himself, and all his penitents, and many others\ndid so earnestly; I, too, with all my might, and as many as I\nknew to be servants of God, prayed that His Majesty would be\npleased to lead me by another way.  This lasted, I think, about\ntwo years; and this was the subject of my continual prayer to\nour Lord.\n21. But there was no comfort for me when I thought of the\npossibility that Satan could speak to me so often.  Now that I\nwas never alone for prayer, our Lord made me recollected even\nduring conversation: He spoke what He pleased,--I could not avoid\nit; and, though it distressed me, I was forced to listen.  I was\nby myself, having no one in whom I could find any comfort; unable\nto pray or read, like a person stunned by heavy trials, and by\nthe dread that the evil one had deluded me; utterly disquieted\nand wearied, not knowing what would become of me.  I have been\noccasionally--yea, very often--in distress, but never before in\ndistress so great.  I was in this state for four or five hours;\nthere was no comfort for me, either from heaven or on earth--only\nour Lord left me to suffer, afraid of a thousand dangers.\n22. O my Lord, how true a friend art Thou! how powerful!\nThou showest Thy power when Thou wilt; and Thou dost will it\nalways, if only we will it also.  Let the whole creation praise\nThee, O Thou Lord of the world!  Oh, that a voice might go forth\nover all the earth, proclaiming Thy faithfulness to those who\nlove Thee! All things fail; but Thou, Lord of all, never failest!\nThey who love Thee, oh, how little they have to suffer! oh, how\ngently, how tenderly, how sweetly Thou, O my Lord, dealest with\nthem! Oh, that no one had ever been occupied with any other love\nthan Thine!  It seems as if Thou didst subject those who love\nThee to a severe trial: but it is in order that they may learn,\nin the depths of that trial, the depths of Thy love.  O my God,\noh, that I had understanding and learning, and a new language, in\norder to magnify Thy works, according to the knowledge of them\nwhich my soul possesses!  Everything fails me, O my Lord; but if\nThou wilt not abandon me, I will never fail Thee.  Let all the\nlearned rise up against me,--let the whole creation persecute\nme,--let the evil spirits torment me,--but do Thou, O Lord, fail\nme not; for I know by experience now the blessedness of that\ndeliverance which Thou dost effect for those who trust only in\nThee.  In this distress,--for then I had never had a single\nvision,--these Thy words alone were enough to remove it, and give\nme perfect peace: \"Be not afraid, my daughter: it is I; and I\nwill not abandon thee.  Fear not.\" [14]\n23. It seems to me that, in the state I was in then, many hours\nwould have been necessary to calm me, and that no one could have\ndone it.  Yet I found myself, through these words alone, tranquil\nand strong, courageous and confident, at rest and enlightened; in\na moment, my soul seemed changed, and I felt I could maintain\nagainst all the world that my prayer was the work of God.\nOh, how good is God! how good is our Lord, and how powerful!\nHe gives not counsel only, but relief as well.  His words are\ndeeds. O my God! as He strengthens our faith, love grows.  So it\nis, in truth; for I used frequently to recollect how our Lord,\nwhen the tempest arose, commanded the winds to be still over the\nsea. [15] So I said to myself: Who is He, that all my faculties\nshould thus obey Him?  Who is He, that gives light in such\ndarkness in a moment; who softens a heart that seemed to be made\nof stone; who gives the waters of sweet tears, where for a long\ntime great dryness seems to have prevailed; who inspires these\ndesires; who bestows this courage?  What have I been thinking of?\nwhat am I afraid of? what is it?  I desire to serve this my Lord;\nI aim at nothing else but His pleasure; I seek no joy, no rest,\nno other good than that of doing His will.  I was so confident\nthat I had no other desire, that I could safely assert it.\n24. Seeing, then, that our Lord is so powerful,--as I see and\nknow He is,--and that the evil spirits are His slaves, of which\nthere can be no doubt, because it is of faith,--and I a servant\nof this our Lord and King,--what harm can Satan do unto me?\nWhy have I not strength enough to fight against all hell?  I took\nup the cross in my hand,--I was changed in a moment into another\nperson, and it seemed as if God had really given me courage\nenough not to be afraid of encountering all the evil spirits.\nIt seemed to me that I could, with the cross, easily defeat them\naltogether.  So I cried out, Come on, all of you; I am the\nservant of our Lord: I should like to see what you can do\nagainst me.\n25. And certainly they seemed to be afraid of me, for I was left\nin peace: I feared them so little, that the terrors, which until\nnow oppressed me, quitted me altogether; and though I saw them\noccasionally,--I shall speak of this by and by, [16]--I was never\nagain afraid of them--on the contrary, they seemed to be afraid\nof me. [17]  I found myself endowed with a certain authority over\nthem, given me by the Lord of all, so that I cared no more for\nthem than for flies.  They seem to be such cowards; for their\nstrength fails them at the sight of any one who despises them.\nThese enemies have not the courage to assail any but those whom\nthey see ready to give in to them, or when God permits them to do\nso, for the greater good of His servants, whom they may try\nand torment.\n26. May it please His Majesty that we fear Him whom we ought to\nfear, [18] and understand that one venial sin can do us more harm\nthan all hell together; for that is the truth.  The evil spirits\nkeep us in terror, because we expose ourselves to the assaults of\nterror by our attachments to honours, possessions, and pleasures.\nFor then the evil spirits, uniting themselves with us,--we become\nour own enemies when we love and seek what we ought to hate,--do\nus great harm.  We ourselves put weapons into their hands, that\nthey may assail us; those very weapons with which we should\ndefend ourselves.  It is a great pity.  But if, for the love of\nGod, we hated all this, and embraced the cross, and set about His\nservice in earnest, Satan would fly away before such realities,\nas from the plague.  He is the friend of lies, and a lie\nhimself. [19]  He will have nothing to do with those who walk in\nthe truth.  When he sees the understanding of any one obscured,\nhe simply helps to pluck out his eyes; if he sees any one already\nblind, seeking peace in vanities,--for all the things of this\nworld are so utterly vanity, that they seem to be but the\nplaythings of a child,--he sees at once that such a one is a\nchild; he treats him as a child, and ventures to wrestle with\nhim--not once, but often.\n27. May it please our Lord that I be not one of these; and may\nHis Majesty give me grace to take that for peace which is really\npeace, that for honour which is really honour, and that for\ndelight which is really a delight.  Let me never mistake one\nthing for another--and then I snap my fingers at all the devils,\nfor they shall be afraid of me.  I do not understand those\nterrors which make us cry out, Satan, Satan! when we may say,\nGod, God! and make Satan tremble.  Do we not know that he cannot\nstir without the permission of God?  What does it mean?  I am\nreally much more afraid of those people who have so great a fear\nof the devil, than I am of the devil himself.  Satan can do me no\nharm whatever, but they can trouble me very much, particularly if\nthey be confessors.  I have spent some years of such great\nanxiety, that even now I am amazed that I was able to bear it.\nBlessed be our Lord, who has so effectually helped me!\n1. Philip. a SS. Trinitate, Theolog.

I look upon the courage which our Lord has implanted in me\nagainst evil spirits as one of the greatest mercies which He has\nbestowed upon me; for a cowardly soul, afraid of anything but sin\nagainst God, is a very unseemly thing, when we have on our side\nthe King omnipotent, our Lord most high, who can do all things,\nand subjects all things to Himself.  There is nothing to be\nafraid of if we walk, as I said before, [1] in the truth, in the\nsight of His Majesty, with a pure conscience.  And for this end,\nas I said in the same place, I would have myself all fears, that\nI may not for one instant offend Him who in that instant is able\nto destroy us.  If His Majesty is pleased with us, whoever\nresists us--be he who he may--will be utterly disappointed.\n2. It may be so, you will say; but, then, where is that soul so\njust as to please Him in everything?--and that is the reason why\nwe are afraid.  Certainly it is not my soul, which is most\nwretched, unprofitable, and full of misery.  God is not like man\nin His ways; He knows our weakness.  But the soul perceives, by\nthe help of certain great signs, whether it loves God of a truth;\nfor the love of those souls who have come to this state is not\nhidden as it was at first, but is full of high impulses, and of\nlongings for the vision of God, as I shall show hereafter--or\nrather, as I have shown already. [2]  Everything wearies,\neverything distresses, everything torments the soul, unless it be\nsuffered with God, or for God.  There is no rest which is not a\nweariness, because the soul knows itself to be away from its true\nrest; and so love is made most manifest, and, as I have just\nsaid, impossible to hide.\n3. It happened to me, on another occasion to be grievously tried,\nand much spoken against on account of a certain affair,--of which\nI will speak hereafter, [3]--by almost everybody in the place\nwhere I am living, and by the members of my Order.  When I was in\nthis distress, and afflicted by many occasions of disquiet\nwherein I was placed, our Lord spoke to me, saying: \"What art\nthou afraid of? knowest thou not that I am almighty?  I will do\nwhat I have promised thee.\"  And so, afterwards, was it done.\nI found myself at once so strong, that I could have undertaken\nanything, so it seemed, immediately, even if I had to endure\ngreater trials for His service, and had to enter on a new state\nof suffering.  These locutions are so frequent, that I cannot\ncount them; many of them are reproaches, and He sends them when I\nfall into imperfections.  They are enough to destroy a soul.\nThey correct me, however; for His Majesty--as I said\nbefore [4]--gives both counsel and relief.  There are others\nwhich bring my former sins into remembrance,--particularly when\nHe is about to bestow upon me some special grace,--in such a way\nthat the soul beholds itself as being really judged; for those\nreproaches of God put the truth before it so distinctly, that it\nknows not what to do with itself.  Some are warnings against\ncertain dangers to myself or others; many of them are prophecies\nof future things, three or four years beforehand; and all of them\nhave been fulfilled: some of them I could mention.  Here, then,\nare so many reasons for believing that they come from God, as\nmake it impossible, I believe, for anybody to mistake them.\n4. The safest course in these things is to declare, without fail,\nthe whole state of the soul, together with the graces our Lord\ngives me, to a confessor who is learned, and obey him.  I do so;\nand if I did not, I should have no peace.  Nor is it right that\nwe women, who are unlearned, should have any: there can be no\ndanger in this, but rather great profit.  This is what our Lord\nhas often commanded me to do, and it is what I have often done.\nI had a confessor [5] who mortified me greatly, and now and then\ndistressed me: he tried me heavily, for he disquieted me\nexceedingly; and yet he was the one who, I believe, did me the\nmost good.  Though I had a great affection for him, I was\noccasionally tempted to leave him; I thought that the pain he\ninflicted on me disturbed my prayer.  Whenever I was resolved on\nleaving him, I used to feel instantly that I ought not to do so;\nand one reproach of our Lord would press more heavily upon me\nthan all that my confessor did.  Now and then, I was worn\nout--torture on the one hand, reproaches on the other.\nI required it all, for my will was but little subdued.  Our Lord\nsaid to me once, that there was no obedience where there was no\nresolution to suffer; that I was to think of His sufferings, and\nthen everything would be easy.\n5. One of my confessors, to whom I went in the beginning, advised\nme once, now that my spiritual state was known to be the work of\nGod, to keep silence, and not speak of these things to any one,\non the ground that it was safer to keep these graces secret.\nTo me, the advice seemed good, because I felt it so much whenever\nI had to speak of them to my confessor; [6] I was also so ashamed\nof myself, that I felt it more keenly at times to speak of them\nthan I should have done in confessing grave sins, particularly\nwhen the graces I had to reveal were great.  I thought they did\nnot believe me, and that they were laughing at me.  I felt it so\nmuch,--for I look on this as an irreverent treatment of the\nmarvels of God,--that I was glad to be silent. I learned then\nthat I had been ill-advised by that confessor, because I ought\nnever to hide anything from my confessor; for I should find great\nsecurity if I told everything; and if I did otherwise, I might at\nany time fall into delusions. [7]\n6. Whenever our Lord commanded me to do one thing in prayer, and\nif my confessor forbade it, our Lord Himself told me to obey my\nconfessor.  His Majesty afterwards would change the mind of that\nconfessor, so that he would have me do what he had forbidden\nbefore.  When we were deprived of many books written in Spanish,\nand forbidden to read them,--I felt it deeply, for some of these\nbooks were a great comfort to me, and I could not read them in\nLatin,--our Lord said to me, \"Be not troubled; I will give thee a\nliving book.\"  I could not understand why this was said to me,\nfor at that time I had never had a vision. [8]  But, a very few\ndays afterwards, I understood it well enough; for I had so much\nto think of, and such reasons for self-recollection in what I saw\nbefore me and our Lord dealt so lovingly with me, in teaching me\nin so many ways, that I had little or no need whatever of books.\nHis Majesty has been to me a veritable Book, in which I saw all\ntruth.  Blessed be such a Book, which leaves behind an impression\nof what is read therein, and in such a way that it cannot\nbe forgotten!\n7. Who can look upon our Lord, covered with wounds, and bowed\ndown under persecutions, without accepting, loving, and longing\nfor them?  Who can behold but a part of that glory which He will\ngive to those who serve Him without confessing that all he may\ndo, and all he may suffer, are altogether as nothing, when we may\nhope for such a reward?  Who can look at the torments of lost\nsouls without acknowledging the torments of this life to be\njoyous delights in comparison, and confessing how much they owe\nto our Lord in having saved them so often from the place of\ntorments? [9]  But as, by the help of God, I shall speak more at\nlarge of certain things, I wish now to go on with the story of my\nlife.  Our Lord grant that I have been clear enough in what I\nhave hitherto said!  I feel assured that he will understand me\nwho has had experience herein, and that he will see I have\npartially succeeded; but as to him who has had no such\nexperience, I should not be surprised if he regarded it all as\nfolly.  It is enough for him that it is I who say it, in order to\nbe free from blame; neither will I blame any one who shall so\nspeak of it.  Our Lord grant that I may never fail to do His\nwill!  Amen.\n1. Ch. xxv. \u00a7 26.\n2. Ch. xv. \u00a7 6.\n3. Ch. xxxiii.; the foundation of the house of St. Joseph.\n4. Ch. xxv. \u00a7 23.\n5.

St. Luke xvi. 28: \"Ne et ipsi veniant in hunc\nlocum\u00a0tormentorum.\"\nChapter XXVII.\nThe Saint Prays to Be Directed by a Different Way.\nIntellectual Visions.\n1. I now resume the story of my life.  I was in great pain and\ndistress; and many prayers, as I said, [1] were made on my\nbehalf, that our Lord would lead me by another and a safer way;\nfor this, they told me, was so suspicious.  The truth is, that\nthough I was praying to God for this, and wished I had a desire\nfor another way, yet, when I saw the progress I was making, I was\nunable really to desire a change,--though I always prayed for\nit,--excepting on those occasions when I was extremely cast down\nby what people said to me, and by the fears with which they\nfilled me.\n2. I felt that I was wholly changed; I could do nothing but put\nmyself in the hands of God: He knew what was expedient for me;\nlet Him do with me according to His will in all things.  I saw\nthat by this way I was directed heavenwards, and that formerly I\nwas going down to hell.  I could not force myself to desire a\nchange, nor believe that I was under the influence of Satan.\nThough I was doing all I could to believe the one and to desire\nthe other, it was not in my power to do so.  I offered up all my\nactions, if there should be any good in them, for this end; I had\nrecourse to the Saints for whom I had a devotion, that they might\ndeliver me from the evil one; I made novenas; I commended myself\nto St. Hilarion, to the Angel St. Michael, to whom I had recently\nbecome devout, for this purpose; and many other Saints I\nimportuned, that our Lord might show me the way,--I mean, that\nthey might obtain this for me from His Majesty.\n3. At the end of two years spent in prayer by myself and others\nfor this end, namely, that our Lord would either lead me by\nanother way, or show the truth of this,--for now the locutions of\nour Lord were extremely frequent,--this happened to me.  I was in\nprayer one day,--it was the feast of the glorious\nSt. Peter, [2]--when I saw Christ close by me, or, to speak more\ncorrectly, felt Him; for I saw nothing with the eyes of the body,\nnothing with the eyes of the soul.  He seemed to me to be close\nbeside me; and I saw, too, as I believe, that it was He who was\nspeaking to me. As I was utterly ignorant that such a vision was\npossible, [3] I was extremely afraid at first, and did nothing\nbut weep; however, when He spoke to me but one word to reassure\nme, I recovered myself, and was, as usual, calm and comforted,\nwithout any fear whatever.  Jesus Christ seemed to be by my side\ncontinually, and, as the vision was not imaginary, I saw no form;\nbut I had a most distinct feeling that He was always on my right\nhand, a witness of all I did; and never at any time, if I was but\nslightly recollected, or not too much distracted, could I be\nignorant of His near presence. [4]\n4. I went at once to my confessor, [5] in great distress, to tell\nhim of it.  He asked in what form I saw our Lord.  I told him I\nsaw no form.  He then said: \"How did you know that it was\nChrist?\"  I replied, that I did not know how I knew it; but I\ncould not help knowing that He was close beside me,--that I saw\nHim distinctly, and felt His presence,--that the recollectedness\nof my soul was deeper in the prayer of quiet, and more\ncontinuous,--that the effects thereof were very different from\nwhat I had hitherto experienced,--and that it was most certain.\nI could only make comparisons in order to explain myself; and\ncertainly there are no comparisons, in my opinion, by which\nvisions of this kind can be described.  Afterwards I learnt from\nFriar Peter of Alcantara, a holy man of great spirituality,--of\nwhom I shall speak by and by, [6]--and from others of great\nlearning, that this vision was of the highest order, and one with\nwhich Satan can least interfere; and therefore there are no words\nwhereby to explain,--at least, none for us women, who know so\nlittle: learned men can explain it better.\n5. For if I say that I see Him neither with the eyes of the body,\nnor with those of the soul,--because it was not an imaginary\nvision,--how is it that I can understand and maintain that He\nstands beside me, and be more certain of it than if I saw Him?\nIf it be supposed that it is as if a person were blind, or in the\ndark, and therefore unable to see another who is close to him,\nthe comparison is not exact.  There is a certain likelihood about\nit, however, but not much, because the other senses tell him who\nis blind of that presence: he hears the other speak or move, or\nhe touches him; but in these visions there is nothing like this.\nThe darkness is not felt; only He renders Himself present to the\nsoul by a certain knowledge of Himself which is more clear than\nthe sun. [7]  I do not mean that we now see either a sun or any\nbrightness, only that there is a light not seen, which illumines\nthe understanding so that the soul may have the fruition of so\ngreat a good.  This vision brings with it great blessings.\n6. It is not like that presence of God which is frequently felt,\nparticularly by those who have attained to the prayer of union\nand of quiet, when we seem, at the very commencement of our\nprayer, to find Him with whom we would converse, and when we seem\nto feel that He hears us by the effects and the spiritual\nimpressions of great love and faith of which we are then\nconscious, as well as by the good resolutions, accompanied by\nsweetness, which we then make.  This is a great grace from God;\nand let him to whom He has given it esteem it much, because it is\na very high degree of prayer; but it is not vision.  God is\nunderstood to be present there by the effects He works in the\nsoul: that is the way His Majesty makes His presence felt; but\nhere, in this vision, it is seen clearly that Jesus Christ is\npresent, the Son of the Virgin.  In the prayer of union and of\nquiet, certain inflowings of the Godhead are present; but in the\nvision, the Sacred Humanity also, together with them, is pleased\nto be our visible companion, and to do us good.\n7. My confessor next asked me, who told me it was Jesus\nChrist. [8]  I replied that He often told me so Himself; but,\neven before He told me so, there was an impression on my\nunderstanding that it was He; and before this He used to tell me\nso, and I saw Him not.  If a person whom I had never seen, but of\nwhom I had heard, came to speak to me, and I were blind or in the\ndark, and told me who he was, I should believe him; but I could\nnot so confidently affirm that he was that person, as I might do\nif I had seen him.  But in this vision I could do so, because so\nclear a knowledge is impressed on the soul that all doubt seems\nimpossible, though He is not seen.  Our Lord wills that this\nknowledge be so graven on the understanding, that we can no more\nquestion His presence than we can question that which we see with\nour eyes: not so much even; for very often there arises a\nsuspicion that we have imagined things we think we see; but here,\nthough there may be a suspicion in the first instant, there\nremains a certainty so great, that the doubt has no force\nwhatever.  So also is it when God teaches the soul in another\nway, and speaks to it without speaking, in the way I\nhave described.\n8. There is so much of heaven in this language, that it cannot\nwell be understood on earth, though we may desire ever so much to\nexplain it, if our Lord will not teach it experimentally.\nOur Lord impresses in the innermost soul that which He wills that\nsoul to understand; and He manifests it there without images or\nformal words, after the manner of the vision I am speaking of.\nConsider well this way in which God works, in order that the soul\nmay understand what He means--His great truths and mysteries; for\nvery often what I understand, when our Lord explains to me the\nvision, which it is His Majesty's pleasure to set before me, is\nafter this manner; and it seems to me that this is a state with\nwhich the devil can least interfere, for these reasons; but if\nthese reasons are not good, I must be under a delusion.  The\nvision and the language are matters of such pure spirituality,\nthat there is no toil of the faculties, or of the senses, out of\nwhich--so seems to me--the devil can derive any advantage.\n9. It is only at intervals, and for an instant, that this occurs;\nfor generally--so I think--the senses are not taken away, and the\nfaculties are not suspended: they preserve their ordinary state.\nIt is not always so in contemplation; on the contrary, it is very\nrarely so; but when it is so, I say that we do nothing whatever\nourselves: no work of ours is then possible; all that is done is\napparently the work of our Lord.  It is as if food had been\nreceived into the stomach which had not first been eaten, and\nwithout our knowing how it entered; but we do know well that it\nis there, though we know not its nature, nor who it was that\nplaced it there.  In this vision, I know who placed it; but I do\nnot know how He did it.  I neither saw it, nor felt it; I never\nhad any inclination to desire it, and I never knew before that\nsuch a thing was possible.\n10. In the locutions of which I spoke before, [9] God makes the\nunderstanding attentive, though it may be painful to understand\nwhat is said; then the soul seems to have other ears wherewith it\nhears; and He forces it to listen, and will not let it be\ndistracted.  The soul is like a person whose hearing was good,\nand who is not suffered to stop his ears, while people standing\nclose beside him speak to him with a loud voice.  He may be\nunwilling to hear, yet hear he must.  Such a person contributes\nsomething of his own; for he attends to what is said to him; but\nhere there is nothing of the kind: even that little, which is\nnothing more than the bare act of listening, which is granted to\nit in the other case, is now out of its power.  It finds its food\nprepared and eaten; it has nothing more to do but to enjoy it.\nIt is as if one without ever learning, without taking the pains\neven to learn to read, and without studying any subject whatever,\nshould find himself in possession of all knowledge, not knowing\nhow or whence it came to him, seeing that he had never taken the\ntrouble even to learn the alphabet.  This last comparison seems\nto me to throw some light on this heavenly gift; for the soul\nfinds itself learned in a moment, and the mystery of the most\nHoly Trinity so clearly revealed to it, together with other most\ndeep doctrines, that there is no theologian in the world with\nwhom it would hesitate to dispute for the truth of these matters.\n11. It is impossible to describe the surprise of the soul when it\nfinds that one of these graces is enough to change it utterly,\nand make it love nothing but Him who, without waiting for\nanything itself might do, renders it fit for blessings so high,\ncommunicates to it His secrets, and treats it with so much\naffection and love.  Some of the graces He bestows are liable to\nsuspicion because they are so marvellous, and given to one who\nhas deserved them so little--incredible, too, without a most\nlively faith.  I intend, therefore, to mention very few of those\ngraces which our Lord has wrought in me, if I should not be\nordered otherwise; but there are certain visions of which I shall\nspeak, an account of which may be of some service.  In doing so,\nI shall either dispel his fears to whom our Lord sends them, and\nwho, as I used to do, thinks them impossible, or I shall explain\nthe way or the road by which our Lord has led me; and that is\nwhat I have been commanded to describe.\n12. Now, going back to speak of this way of understanding, what\nit is seems to me to be this: it is our Lord's will in every way\nthat the soul should have some knowledge of what passes in\nheaven; and I think that, as the blessed there without speech\nunderstand one another,--I never knew this for certain till our\nLord of His goodness made me see it; He showed it to me in a\ntrance,--so is it here: God and the soul understand one another,\nmerely because His Majesty so wills it, without the help of other\nmeans, to express the love there is between them both.  In the\nsame way on earth, two persons of sound sense, if they love each\nother much, can even, without any signs, understand one another\nonly by their looks.  It must be so here, though we do not see\nhow, as these two lovers earnestly regard each the other: the\nbridegroom says so to the bride in the Canticle, so I believe,\nand I have heard that it is spoken of there. [10]\n13. Oh, marvellous goodness of God, in that Thou permittest eyes\nwhich have looked upon so much evil as those of my soul to look\nupon Thee!  May they never accustom themselves, after looking on\nThee, to look upon vile things again! and may they have pleasure\nin nothing but in Thee, O Lord!  Oh, ingratitude of men, how far\nwill it go!  I know by experience that what I am saying is true,\nand that all we can say is exceedingly little, when we consider\nwhat Thou doest to the soul which Thou hast led to such a state\nas this.  O souls, you who have begun to pray, and you who\npossess the true faith, what can you be in search of even in this\nlife, let alone that which is for ever, that is comparable to the\nleast of these graces?  Consider, and it is true, that God gives\nHimself to those who give up everything for Him.  God is not an\naccepter of persons. [11]  He loves all; there is no excuse for\nany one, however wicked he may be, seeing that He hath thus dealt\nwith me, raising me to the state I am in. Consider, that what I\nam saying is not even an iota of what may be said; I say only\nthat which is necessary to show the kind of the vision and of the\ngrace which God bestows on the soul; for that cannot be told\nwhich it feels when our Lord admits it to the understanding of\nHis secrets and of His mighty works.  The joy of this is so far\nabove all conceivable joys, that it may well make us loathe all\nthe joys of earth; for they are all but dross; and it is an\nodious thing to make them enter into the comparison, even if we\nmight have them for ever.  Those which our Lord gives, what are\nthey?  One drop only of the waters of the overflowing river which\nHe is reserving for us.\n14. It is a shame!  And, in truth, I am ashamed of myself; if\nshame could have a place in heaven, I should certainly be the\nmost ashamed there.  Why do we seek blessings and joys so great,\nbliss without end, and all at the cost of our good Jesus?\nShall we not at least weep with the daughters of Jerusalem, [12]\nif we do not help to carry his cross with the Cyrenean? [13]\nIs it by pleasure and idle amusements that we can attain to the\nfruition of what He purchased with so much blood?  It is\nimpossible.  Can we think that we can, by preserving our honour,\nwhich is vanity, recompense Him for the sufferings He endured,\nthat we might reign with Him for ever?  This is not the way; we\nare going by the wrong road utterly, and we shall never arrive\nthere.  You, my father, must lift up your voice, and utter these\ntruths aloud, seeing that God has taken from me the power of\ndoing it.  I should like to utter them to myself for ever.\nI listened to them myself, and came to the knowledge of God so\nlate, as will appear by what I have written, that I am ashamed of\nmyself when I speak of this; and so I should like to be silent.\n15. Of one thing, however, I will speak, and I think of it now\nand then,--may it be the good pleasure of our Lord to bring me\non, so that I may have the fruition of it!--what will be the\naccidental glory and the joy of the blessed who have entered on\nit, when they see that, though they were late, yet they left\nnothing undone which it was possible for them to do for God, who\nkept nothing back they could give Him, and who gave what they\ngave in every way they could, according to their strength and\ntheir measure,--they who had more gave more.  How rich will he be\nwho gave up all his riches for Christ!  How honourable will he be\nwho, for His sake, sought no honours whatever, but rather took\npleasure in seeing himself abased!  How wise he will be who\nrejoiced when men accounted him as mad!--they did so of Wisdom\nItself! [14]  How few there are of this kind now, because of our\nsins!  Now, indeed, they are all gone whom people regarded as\nmad, [15] because they saw them perform heroic acts, as true\nlovers of Christ.\n16. O world, world! how thou art gaining credit because they are\nfew who know thee!  But do we suppose that God is better pleased\nwhen men account us wise and discreet persons?  We think\nforthwith that there is but little edification given when people\ndo not go about, every one in his degree, with great gravity, in\na dignified way.  Even in the friar, the ecclesiastic, and the\nnun, if they wear old and patched garments, we think it a\nnovelty, and a scandal to the weak; and even if they are very\nrecollected and given to prayer.  Such is the state of the world,\nand so forgotten are matters of perfection, and those grand\nimpetuosities of the Saints.  More mischief, I think, is done in\nthis way, than by any scandal that might arise if the religious\nshowed in their actions, as they proclaim it in words, that the\nworld is to be held in contempt.  Out of scandals such as this,\nour Lord obtains great fruit.  If some people took scandal,\nothers are filled with remorse: anyhow, we should have before us\nsome likeness of that which our Lord and His Apostles endured;\nfor we have need of it now more than ever.\n17. And what an excellent likeness in the person of that blessed\nfriar, Peter of Alcantara, God has just taken from us! [16]\nThe world cannot bear such perfection now; it is said that men's\nhealth is grown feebler, and that we are not now in those former\ntimes.  But this holy man lived in our day; he had a spirit\nstrong as those of another age, and so he trampled on the world.\nIf men do not go about barefooted, nor undergo sharp penances, as\nhe did, there are many ways, as I have said before, [17] of\ntrampling on the world; and our Lord teaches them when He finds\nthe necessary courage. How great was the courage with which His\nMajesty filled the Saint I am speaking of!  He did penance--oh,\nhow sharp it was!--for seven-and-forty years, as all men know.\nI should like to speak of it, for I know it to be all true.\n18. He spoke of it to me and to another person, from whom he kept\nfew or no secrets.  As for me, it was the affection he bore me\nthat led him to speak; for it was our Lord's will that he should\nundertake my defence, and encourage me, at a time when I was in\ngreat straits, as I said before, and shall speak of again. [18]\nHe told me, I think, that for forty years he slept but an hour\nand a half out of the twenty-four, and that the most laborious\npenance he underwent, when he began, was this of overcoming\nsleep.  For that purpose, he was always either kneeling or\nstanding.  When he slept, he sat down, his head resting against a\npiece of wood driven into the wall.  Lie down he could not, if he\nwished it; for his cell, as every one knows, was only four feet\nand a half in length.  In all these years, he never covered his\nhead with his hood, even when the sun was hottest, or the rain\nheaviest.  He never covered his feet: the only garment he wore\nwas made of sackcloth, and that was as tight as it could be, with\nnothing between it and his flesh; over this, he wore a cloak of\nthe same stuff.  He told me that, in the severe cold, he used to\ntake off his cloak, and open the door and the window of his cell,\nin order that when he put his cloak on again, after shutting the\ndoor and the window, he might give some satisfaction to his body\nin the pleasure it might have in the increased warmth.\nHis ordinary practice was to eat but once in three days.  He said\nto me, \"Why are you astonished at it? it is very possible for any\none who is used to it.\"  One of his companions told me that he\nwould be occasionally eight days without eating: that must have\nbeen when he was in prayer; for he was subject to trances, and to\nthe impetuosities of the love of God, of which I was once a\nwitness myself.\n19. His poverty was extreme; and his mortification, from his\nyouth, was such,--so he told me,--that he was three years in one\nof the houses of his Order without knowing how to distinguish one\nfriar from another, otherwise than by the voice; for he never\nraised his eyes: and so, when he was obliged to go from one part\nof the house to the other, he never knew the way, unless he\nfollowed the friars.  His journeys, also, were made in the same\nway.  For many years, he never saw a woman's face.  He told me\nthat it was nothing to him then whether he saw it or not: but he\nwas an aged man when I made his acquaintance; and his weakness\nwas so great, that he seemed like nothing else but the roots of\ntrees.  With all his sanctity, he was very agreeable; though his\nwords were few, unless when he was asked questions; he was very\npleasant to speak to, for he had a most clear understanding.\n20. Many other things I should like to say of him, if I were not\nafraid, my father, that you will say, Why does she meddle here?\nand it is in that fear I have written this.  So I leave the\nsubject, only saying that his last end was like his\nlife--preaching to, and exhorting, his brethren.  When he saw\nthat the end was comes he repeated the Psalm, [19] \"L\u00e6tatus sum\nin his qu\u00e6 dicta sunt mihi;\" and then, kneeling down, he\u00a0died.\n21. Since then, it has pleased our Lord that I should find more\nhelp from him than during his life.  He advises me in many\nmatters.  I have often seen him in great glory.  The first time\nhe appeared to me, he said: \"O blessed penance, which has merited\nso great a reward!\" with other things.  A year before his death,\nhe appeared to me being then far away.  I knew he was about to\ndie, and so I sent him word to that effect, when he was some\nleagues from here.  When he died, he appeared to me, and said\nthat he was going to his rest.  I did not believe it.  I spoke of\nit to some persons, and within eight days came the news that he\nwas dead--or, to speak more correctly, he had begun to live\nfor evermore. [20]\n22. Behold here, then, how that life of sharp penance is\nperfected in such great glory: and now he is a greater comfort to\nme, I do believe, than he was on earth.  Our Lord said to me on\none occasion, that persons could not ask Him anything in his\nname, and He not hear them.  I have recommended many things to\nhim that he was to ask of our Lord, and I have seen my petitions\ngranted.  God be blessed for ever!  Amen.\n23. But how I have been talking in order to stir you up never to\nesteem anything in this life!--as if you did not know this, or as\nif you were not resolved to leave everything, and had already\ndone it!  I see so much going wrong in the world, that though my\nspeaking of it is of no other use than to weary me by writing of\nit, it is some relief to me that all I am saying makes against\nmyself.  Our Lord forgive me all that I do amiss herein; and you\ntoo, my father, for wearying you to no purpose.  It seems as if I\nwould make you do penance for my sins herein.\n1. Ch. xxv. \u00a7 20.\n2.

I spent some days, not many, with\nthat vision [1] continually before me.  It did me so much good,\nthat I never ceased to pray.  Even when I did cease, I contrived\nthat it should be in such a way as that I should not displease\nHim whom I saw so clearly present, an eye-witness of my acts.\nAnd though I was occasionally afraid, because so much was said to\nme about delusions, that fear lasted not long, because our Lord\nreassured me.\n2. It pleased our Lord, one day that I was in prayer, to show me\nHis Hands, and His Hands only.  The beauty of them was so great,\nthat no language can describe it.  This put me in great fear; for\neverything that is strange, in the beginning of any new grace\nfrom God, makes me very much afraid.  A few days later, I saw His\ndivine Face, and I was utterly entranced.  I could not understand\nwhy our Lord showed Himself in this way, seeing that, afterwards,\nHe granted me the grace of seeing His whole Person.  Later on, I\nunderstood that His Majesty was dealing with me according to the\nweakness of my nature.  May He be blessed for ever!  A glory so\ngreat was more than one so base and wicked could bear; and our\nmerciful Lord, knowing this, ordered it in this way.\n3. You will think, my father, that it required no great courage\nto look upon Hands and Face so beautiful.  But so beautiful are\nglorified bodies, that the glory which surrounds them renders\nthose who see that which is so supernatural and beautiful beside\nthemselves.  It was so with me: I was in such great fear,\ntrouble, and perplexity at the sight.  Afterwards there ensued a\nsense of safety and certainty, together with other results, so\nthat all fear passed immediately away. [2]\n4. On one of the feasts of St. Paul, [3] when I was at Mass,\nthere stood before me the most Sacred Humanity, [4] as painters\nrepresent Him after the resurrection, in great beauty and\nmajesty, as I particularly described it to you, my father, when\nyou had insisted on it.  It was painful enough to have to write\nabout it, for I could not describe it without doing great\nviolence to myself.  But I described it as well as I could, and\nthere is no reason why I should now recur to it.  One thing,\nhowever, I have to say: if in heaven itself there were nothing\nelse to delight our eyes but the great beauty of glorified\nbodies, that would be an excessive bliss, particularly the vision\nof the Humanity of Jesus Christ our Lord.  If here below, where\nHis Majesty shows Himself to us according to the measure which\nour wretchedness can bear, it is so great, what must it be there,\nwhere the fruition of it is complete!\n5. This vision, though imaginary, I never saw with my bodily\neyes, nor, indeed, any other, but only with the eyes of the soul.\nThose who understand these things better than I do, say that the\nintellectual vision is more perfect than this; and this, the\nimaginary vision, much more perfect than those visions which are\nseen by the bodily eyes.  The latter kind of visions, they say,\nis the lowest; and it is by these that the devil can most delude\nus. [5]  I did not know it then; for I wished, when this grace\nhad been granted me, that it had been so in such a way that I\ncould see it with my bodily eyes, in order that my confessor\nmight not say to me that I indulged in fancies.\n6. After the vision was over, it happened that I too\nimagined--the thought came at once--I had fancied these things;\nso I was distressed, because I had spoken of them to my\nconfessor, thinking that I might have been deceiving him.\nThere was another lamentation: I went to my confessor, and told\nhim of my doubts. He would ask me whether I told him the truth so\nfar as I knew it; or, if not, had I intended to deceive him?\nI would reply, that I told the truth; for, to the best of my\nbelief, I did not lie, nor did I mean anything of the kind;\nneither would I tell a lie for the whole world. [6]  This he knew\nwell enough; and, accordingly, he contrived to quiet me; and I\nfelt so much the going to him with these doubts, that I cannot\ntell how Satan could have put it into my head that I invented\nthose things for the purpose of tormenting myself.\n7. But our Lord made such haste to bestow this grace upon me, and\nto declare the reality of it, that all doubts of the vision being\na fancy on my part were quickly taken away, and ever since I see\nmost clearly how silly I was.  For if I were to spend many years\nin devising how to picture to myself anything so beautiful, I\nshould never be able, nor even know how, to do it for it is\nbeyond the reach of any possible imagination here below: the\nwhiteness and brilliancy alone are inconceivable.  It is not a\nbrilliancy which dazzles, but a delicate whiteness and a\nbrilliancy infused, furnishing the most excessive delight to the\neyes, never wearied thereby, nor by the visible brightness which\nenables us to see a beauty so divine.  It is a light so different\nfrom any light here below, that the very brightness of the sun we\nsee, in comparison with the brightness and light before our eyes,\nseems to be something so obscure, that no one would ever wish to\nopen his eyes again.\n8. It is like most pellucid water running in a bed of crystal,\nreflecting the rays of the sun, compared with most muddy water on\na cloudy day, flowing on the surface of the earth.  Not that\nthere is anything like the sun present here, nor is the light\nlike that of the sun: this light seems to be natural; and, in\ncomparison with it, every other light is something artificial.\nIt is a light which knows no night; but rather, as it is always\nlight, nothing ever disturbs it.  In short, it is such that no\nman, however gifted he may be, can ever, in the whole course of\nhis life, arrive at any imagination of what it is.  God puts it\nbefore us so instantaneously, that we could not open our eyes in\ntime to see it, if it were necessary for us to open them at all.\nBut whether our eyes be open or shut, it makes no difference\nwhatever; for when our Lord wills, we must see it, whether we\nwill or not.  No distraction can shut it out, no power can resist\nit, nor can we attain to it by any diligence or efforts of our\nown.  I know this by experience well, as I shall show you.\n9. That which I wish now to speak of is the manner in which our\nLord manifests Himself in these visions.  I do not mean that I am\ngoing to explain how it is that a light so strong can enter the\ninterior sense, or so distinct an image the understanding, so as\nto seem to be really there; for this must be work for learned\nmen.  Our Lord has not been pleased to let me understand how it\nis.  I am so ignorant myself, and so dull of understanding, that,\nalthough people have very much wished to explain it to me, I have\nnever been able to understand how it can be.\n10. This is the truth: though you, my father, may think that I\nhave a quick understanding, it is not so; for I have found out,\nin many ways, that my understanding can take in only, as they\nsay, what is given to it to eat.  Sometimes my confessor used to\nbe amazed at my ignorance: and he never explained to me--nor,\nindeed, did I desire to understand--how God did this, nor how it\ncould be.  Nor did I ever ask; though, as I have said, [7] I had\nconverse for many years with men of great learning.  But I did\nask them if this or that were a sin or not: as for everything\nelse, the thought that God did it all was enough for me.  I saw\nthere was no reason to be afraid, but great reason to praise Him.\nOn the other hand, difficulties increase my devotion; and the\ngreater the difficulty the greater the increase.\n11. I will therefore relate what my experience has shown me; but\nhow our Lord brought it about, you, my father, will explain\nbetter than I can, and make clear all that is obscure, and beyond\nmy skill to explain.  Now and then it seemed to me that what I\nsaw was an image; but most frequently it was not so.  I thought\nit was Christ Himself, judging by the brightness in which He was\npleased to show Himself.  Sometimes the vision was so indistinct,\nthat I thought it was an image; but still not like a picture,\nhowever well painted--and I have seen many good pictures.\nIt would be absurd to suppose that the one bears any resemblance\nwhatever to the other, for they differ as a living person differs\nfrom his portrait, which, however well drawn, cannot be lifelike,\nfor it is plain that it is a dead thing.  But let this pass,\nthough to the purpose, and literally true.\n12. I do not say this by way of comparison, for comparisons are\nnever exact, but because it is the truth itself, as there is the\nsame difference here that there is between a living subject and\nthe portrait thereof, neither more nor less: for if what I saw\nwas an image, it was a living image,--not a dead man, but the\nliving Christ: and He makes me see that He is God and man,--not\nas He was in the sepulchre, but as He was when He had gone forth\nfrom it, risen from the dead.  He comes at times in majesty so\ngreat, that no one can have any doubt that it is our Lord\nHimself, especially after Communion: we know that He is then\npresent, for faith says so.  He shows Himself so clearly to be\nthe Lord of that little dwelling-place, that the soul seems to be\ndissolved and lost in Christ.  O my Jesus, who can describe the\nmajesty wherein Thou showest Thyself!  How utterly Thou art the\nLord of the whole world, and of heaven, and of a thousand other\nand innumerable worlds and heavens, the creation of which is\npossible to Thee!  The soul understands by that majesty wherein\nThou showest Thyself that it is nothing for Thee to be Lord of\nall this.\n13. Here it is plain, O my Jesus, how slight is the power of all\nthe devils in comparison with Thine, and how he who is pleasing\nunto Thee is able to tread all hell under his feet.  Here we see\nwhy the devils trembled when Thou didst go down to Limbus, and\nwhy they might have longed for a thousand hells still lower, that\nthey might escape from Thy terrible Majesty.  I see that it is\nThy will the soul should feel the greatness of Thy Majesty, and\nthe power of Thy most Sacred Humanity, united with Thy Divinity.\nHere, too, we see what the day of judgment will be, when we shall\nbehold the King in His Majesty, and in the rigour of His justice\nagainst the wicked.  Here we learn true humility, imprinted in\nthe soul by the sight of its own wretchedness, of which now it\ncannot be ignorant.  Here, also, is confusion of face, and true\nrepentance for sins; for though the soul sees that our Lord shows\nhow He loves it, yet it knows not where to go, and so is\nutterly dissolved.\n14. My meaning is, that so exceedingly great is the power of this\nvision, when our Lord shows the soul much of His grandeur and\nmajesty, that it is impossible, in my opinion, for any soul to\nendure it, if our Lord did not succour it in a most supernatural\nway, by throwing it into a trance or ecstasy, whereby the vision\nof the divine presence is lost in the fruition thereof.  It is\ntrue that afterwards the vision is forgotten; but there remains\nso deep an impression of the majesty and beauty of God, that it\nis impossible to forget it, except when our Lord is pleased that\nthe soul should suffer from aridity and desolation, of which I\nshall speak hereafter; [8] for then it seems to forget God\nHimself.  The soul is itself no longer, it is always inebriated;\nit seems as if a living love of God, of the highest kind, made a\nnew beginning within it; for though the former vision, which I\nsaid represented God without any likeness of Him, [9] is of a\nhigher kind, yet because of our weakness, in order that the\nremembrance of the vision may last, and that our thoughts may be\nwell occupied, it is a great matter that a presence so divine\nshould remain and abide in our imagination. These two kinds of\nvisions come almost always together, and they do so come; for we\nbehold the excellency and beauty and glory of the most Holy\nHumanity with the eyes of the soul.  And in the other way I have\nspoken of,--that of intellectual vision,--we learn how He is God,\nis mighty, can do all things, commands all things, governs all\nthings, and fills all things with His love.\n15. This vision is to be esteemed very highly; nor is there, in\nmy opinion, any risk in it, because the fruits of it show that\nthe devil has no power here.  I think he tried three or four\ntimes to represent our Lord to me, in this way, by a false image\nof Him.  He takes the appearance of flesh, but he cannot\ncounterfeit the glory which it has when the vision is from God.\nSatan makes his representations in order to undo the true vision\nwhich the soul has had: but the soul resists instinctively; is\ntroubled, disgusted, and restless; it loses that devotion and joy\nit previously had, and cannot pray at all.  In the beginning, it\nso happened to me three or four times.  These satanic visions are\nvery different things; and even he who shall have attained to the\nprayer of quiet only will, I believe, detect them by those\nresults of them which I described when I was speaking of\nlocutions. [10]  They are most easily recognised; and if a soul\nconsents not to its own delusion, I do not think that Satan will\nbe able to deceive it, provided it walks in humility and\nsingleness of heart.  He who shall have had the true vision,\ncoming from God, detects the false visions at once; for, though\nthey begin with a certain sweetness and joy, the soul rejects\nthem of itself; and the joy which Satan ministers must be, I\nthink, very different--it shows no traces of pure and holy love:\nSatan very quickly betrays himself.\n16. Thus, then, as I believe, Satan can do no harm to anyone who\nhas had experience of these things; for it is the most impossible\nof all impossible things that all this may be the work of the\nimagination.  There is no ground whatever for the supposition;\nfor the very beauty and whiteness of one of our Lord's Hands [11]\nare beyond our imagination altogether.  How is it that we see\npresent before us, in a moment, what we do not remember, what we\nhave never thought of, and, moreover, what, in a long space of\ntime, the imagination could not compass, because, as I have just\nsaid, [12] it far transcends anything we can comprehend in this\nlife?  This, then, is not possible.  Whether we have any power in\nthe matter or not will appear by what I am now going to say.\n17. If the vision were the work of a man's own\nunderstanding,--setting aside that such a vision would not\naccomplish the great results of the true one, nor, indeed, any at\nall,--it would be as the act of one who tries to go to sleep, and\nyet continues awake, because sleep has not come.  He longs for\nit, because of some necessity or weakness in his head: and so he\nlulls himself to sleep, and makes efforts to procure it, and now\nand then thinks he has succeeded; but, if the sleep be not real,\nit will not support him, nor supply strength to his head: on the\ncontrary, his head will very often be the worse for it.  So will\nit be here, in a measure; the soul will be dissipated, neither\nsustained nor strengthened; on the contrary, it will be wearied\nand disgusted.  But, in the true vision, the riches which abide\nin the soul cannot be described; even the body receives health\nand comfort.\n18. I urged this argument, among others, when they told me that\nmy visions came from the evil one, and that I imagined them\nmyself,--and it was very often,--and made use of certain\nillustrations, as well as I could, and as our Lord suggested to\nme.  But all was to little purpose; for as there were most holy\npersons in the place,--in comparison with whom I was a mass of\nperdition,--whom God did not lead by this way, they were at once\nfilled with fear; they thought it all came through my sins.\nAnd so my state was talked about, and came to the knowledge of\nmany; though I had spoken of it to no one, except my confessor,\nor to those to whom he commanded [13] me to speak of it.\n19. I said to them once, If they who thus speak of my state were\nto tell me that a person with whom I had just conversed, and whom\nI knew well, was not that person, but that I was deluding myself,\nand that they knew it, I should certainly trust them rather than\nmy own eyes.  But if that person left with me certain\njewels,--and if, possessing none previously, I held the jewels in\nmy hand as pledges of a great love,--and if I were now rich,\ninstead of poor as before,--I should not be able to believe this\nthat they said, though I might wish it.  These jewels I could now\nshow them, for all who knew me saw clearly that my soul was\nchanged,--and so my confessor said; for the difference was very\ngreat in every way--not a pretence, but such as all might most\nclearly observe.  As I was formerly so wicked, I said, I could\nnot believe that Satan, if he wished to deceive me and take me\ndown to hell, would have recourse to means so adverse to his\npurpose as this, of rooting out my faults, implanting virtues and\nspiritual strength; for I saw clearly that I had become at once\nanother person through the instrumentality of these visions.\n20. My confessor, who was, as I said before, [14] one of the\nfathers of the Society of Jesus, and a really holy man, answered\nthem in the same way,--so I learnt afterwards.  He was a most\ndiscreet man, and of great humility; but this great humility of\nhis brought me into serious trouble: for, though he was a man\nmuch given to prayer, and learned, he never trusted his own\njudgment, because our Lord was not leading him by this way.\nHe had, therefore, much to suffer on my account, in many ways.\nI knew they used to say to him that he must be on his guard\nagainst me, lest Satan should delude him through a belief in\nanything I might say to him.  They gave instances of others who\nwere deluded. [15]  All this distressed me.  I began to be afraid\nI should find no one to hear my confession, [16] and that all\nwould avoid me.  I did nothing but weep.\n21. It was a providence of God that he was willing to stand by me\nand hear my confession.  But he was so great a servant of God,\nthat he would have exposed himself to anything for His sake.\nSo he told me that if I did not offend God, nor swerve from the\ninstructions he gave me, there was no fear I should be deserted\nby him.  He encouraged me always, and quieted me.  He bade me\nnever to conceal anything from him; and I never did. [17]\nHe used to say that, so long as I did this, the devil, if it were\nthe devil, could not hurt me; on the contrary, out of that evil\nwhich Satan wished to do me, our Lord would bring forth good.\nHe laboured with all his might to make me perfect.  As I was very\nmuch afraid myself, I obeyed him in everything, though\nimperfectly.  He had much to suffer on my account during three\nyears of trouble and more, because he heard my confession all\nthat time; for in the great persecutions that fell upon me, and\nthe many harsh judgments of me which our Lord permitted,--many of\nwhich I did not deserve,--everything was carried to him, and he\nwas found fault with because of me,--he being all the while\nutterly blameless.\n22. If he had not been so holy a man, and if our Lord had not\nbeen with him, it would have, been impossible for him to bear so\nmuch; for he had to answer those who regarded me as one going to\ndestruction; and they would not believe what he said to them.\nOn the other hand, he had to quiet me, and relieve me of my\nfears; when my fears increased, he had again to reassure me; for,\nafter every vision which was strange to me, our Lord permitted me\nto remain in great fear.  All this was the result of my being\nthen, and of having been, a sinner.  He used to console me out of\nhis great compassion; and, if he had trusted to his own\nconvictions, I should not have had so much to suffer; for God\nrevealed the whole truth to him.  I believe that he received this\nlight from the Blessed Sacrament.\n23. Those servants of God who were not satisfied had many\nconversations with me. [18]  As I spoke to them carelessly, so\nthey misunderstood my meaning in many things.  I had a great\nregard for one of them; for my soul owed him more than I can\ntell.  He was a most holy man, and I felt it most acutely when I\nsaw that he did not understand me.  He had a great desire for my\nimprovement, and hoped our Lord would enlighten me.  So, then,\nbecause I spoke, as I was saying, without careful consideration,\nthey looked upon me as deficient in humility; and when they\ndetected any of my faults--they might have detected many--they\ncondemned me at once.  They used to put certain questions to me,\nwhich I answered simply and carelessly.  Then they concluded\nforthwith that I wished to teach them, and that I considered\nmyself to be a learned woman.  All this was carried to my\nconfessor,--for certainly they desired my amendment--and so he\nwould reprimand me.  This lasted some time, and I was distressed\non many sides; but, with the graces which our Lord gave me, I\nbore it all.\n24. I relate this in order that people may see what a great trial\nit is not to find any one who knows this way of the spirit by\nexperience.  If our Lord had not dealt so favourably with me, I\nknow not what would have become of me.  There were some things\nthat were enough to take away my reason; and now and then I was\nreduced to such straits that I could do nothing but lift up my\neyes to our Lord. [19]  The contradiction of good people, which a\nwretched woman, weak, wicked, and timid as I am, must bear with,\nseems to be nothing when thus described; but I, who in the course\nof my life passed through very great trials, found this one of\nthe heaviest. [20]\n25. May our Lord grant that I may have pleased His Majesty a\nlittle herein; for I am sure that they pleased Him who condemned\nand rebuked me, and that it was all for my great good.\n1.

I have wandered far from the subject; for I undertook to\ngive reasons why the vision was no work of the imagination.\nFor how can we, by any efforts of ours, picture to ourselves the\nHumanity of Christ, and imagine His great beauty?  No little time\nis necessary, if our conception is in any way to resemble it.\nCertainly, the imagination may be able to picture it, and a\nperson may for a time contemplate that picture,--the form and the\nbrightness of it,--and gradually make it more perfect, and so lay\nup that image in his memory.  Who can hinder this, seeing that it\ncould be fashioned by the understanding?  But as to the vision of\nwhich I am speaking, there are no means of bringing it about;\nonly we must behold it when our Lord is pleased to present it\nbefore us, as He wills and what He wills; and there is no\npossibility of taking anything away from it, or of adding\nanything to it; nor is there any way of effecting it, whatever we\nmay do, nor of seeing it when we like, nor of abstaining from\nseeing; if we try to gaze upon it--part of the vision in\nparticular--the vision of Christ is lost at once.\n2. For two years and a half God granted me this grace very\nfrequently; but it is now more than three years since He has\ntaken away from me its continual presence, through another of a\nhigher nature, as I shall perhaps explain hereafter. [1]\nAnd though I saw Him speaking to me, and though I was\ncontemplating His great beauty, and the sweetness with which\nthose words of His came forth from His divine mouth,--they were\nsometimes uttered with severity,--and though I was extremely\ndesirous to behold the colour of His eyes, or the form of them,\nso that I might be able to describe them, yet I never attained to\nthe sight of them, and I could do nothing for that end; on the\ncontrary, I lost the vision altogether.  And though I see that He\nlooks upon me at times with great tenderness, yet so strong is\nHis gaze, that my soul cannot endure it; I fall into a trance so\ndeep, that I lose the beautiful vision, in order to have a\ngreater fruition of it all.\n3. Accordingly, willing or not willing, the vision has\nnothing to do with it.  Our Lord clearly regards nothing but\nhumility and confusion of face, the acceptance of what He wishes\nto give, and the praise of Himself, the Giver.  This is true of\nall visions without exception: we can contribute nothing towards\nthem--we cannot add to them, nor can we take from them; our own\nefforts can neither make nor unmake them.  Our Lord would have us\nsee most clearly that it is no work of ours, but of His Divine\nMajesty; we are therefore the less able to be proud of it: on the\ncontrary, it makes us humble and afraid; for we see that, as our\nLord can take from us the power of seeing what we would see, so\nalso can He take from us these mercies and His grace, and we may\nbe lost for ever.  We must therefore walk in His fear while we\nare living in this our exile.\n4. Our Lord showed Himself to me almost always as He is\nafter His resurrection.  It was the same in the Host; only at\nthose times when I was in trouble, and when it was His will to\nstrengthen me, did He show His wounds.  Sometimes I saw Him on\nthe cross, in the Garden, crowned with thorns,--but that was\nrarely; sometimes also carrying His cross because of my\nnecessities,--I may say so,--or those of others; but always in\nHis glorified body.  Many reproaches and many vexations have I\nborne while telling this--many suspicions and much persecution\nalso.  So certain were they to whom I spoke that I had an evil\nspirit, that some would have me exorcised.  I did not care much\nfor this; but I felt it bitterly when I saw that my confessors\nwere afraid to hear me, or when I knew that they were told of\nanything about me.\n5. Notwithstanding all this, I never could be sorry that I\nhad had these heavenly visions; nor would I exchange even one of\nthem for all the wealth and all the pleasures of the world.\nI always regarded them as a great mercy from our Lord; and to me\nthey were the very greatest treasure,--of this our Lord assured\nme often.  I used to go to Him to complain of all these\nhardships; and I came away from prayer consoled, and with renewed\nstrength.  I did not dare to contradict those who were trying me;\nfor I saw that it made matters worse, because they looked on my\ndoing so as a failure in humility.  I spoke of it to my\nconfessor; he always consoled me greatly when he saw me\nin distress.\n6. As my visions grew in frequency, one of those who used to\nhelp me before--it was to him I confessed when the\nfather-minister [2] could not hear me--began to say that I was\ncertainly under the influence of Satan.  He bade me, now that I\nhad no power of resisting, always to make the sign of the cross\nwhen I had a vision, to point my finger at it by way of\nscorn, [3] and be firmly persuaded of its diabolic nature.  If I\ndid this, the vision would not recur.  I was to be without fear\non the point; God would watch over me, and take the vision\naway. [4]  This was a great hardship for me; for, as I could not\nbelieve that the vision did not come from God, it was a fearful\nthing for me to do; and I could not wish, as I said before, that\nthe visions should be withheld.  However, I did at last as I was\nbidden.  I prayed much to our Lord, that He would deliver me from\ndelusions. I was always praying to that effect, and with many\ntears.  I had recourse also to St. Peter and St. Paul; for our\nLord had said to me--it was on their feast that He had appeared\nto me the first time [5]--that they would preserve me from\ndelusion.  I used to see them frequently most distinctly on my\nleft hand; but that vision was not imaginary.  These glorious\nSaints were my very good lords.\n7. It was to me a most painful thing to make a show of\ncontempt whenever I saw our Lord in a vision; for when I saw Him\nbefore me, if I were to be cut in pieces, I could not believe it\nwas Satan.  This was to me, therefore, a heavy kind of penance;\nand accordingly, that I might not be so continually crossing\nmyself, I used to hold a crucifix in my hand.  This I did almost\nalways; but I did not always make signs of contempt, because I\nfelt that too much.  It reminded me of the insults which the Jews\nheaped upon Him; and so I prayed Him to forgive me, seeing that I\ndid so in obedience to him who stood in His stead, and not to lay\nthe blame on me, seeing that he was one of those whom He had\nplaced as His ministers in His Church.  He said to me that I was\nnot to distress myself--that I did well to obey; but He would\nmake them see the truth of the matter.  He seemed to me to be\nangry when they made me give up my prayer. [6]  He told me to say\nto them that this was tyranny.  He gave me reasons for believing\nthat the vision was not satanic; some of them I mean to repeat by\nand by.\n8. On one occasion,when I was holding in my hand the cross\nof my rosary, He took it from me into His own hand.  He returned\nit; but it was then four large stones incomparably more precious\nthan diamonds; for nothing can be compared with what is\nsupernatural.  Diamonds seem counterfeits and imperfect when\ncompared with these precious stones.  The five wounds were\ndelineated on them with most admirable art.  He said to me, that\nfor the future that cross would appear so to me always; and so it\ndid.  I never saw the wood of which it was made, but only the\nprecious stones.  They were seen, however, by no one else,--only\nby myself. [7]\n9. When they had begun to insist on my putting my visions to\na test like this, and resisting them, the graces I received were\nmultiplied more and more.  I tried to distract myself; I never\nceased to be in prayer: even during sleep my prayer seemed to be\ncontinual; for now my love grew, I made piteous complaints to our\nLord, and told Him I could not bear it.  Neither was it in my\npower--though I desired, and, more than that, even strove--to\ngive up thinking of Him.  Nevertheless, I obeyed to the utmost of\nmy power; but my power was little or nothing in the matter; and\nour Lord never released me from that obedience; but though He\nbade me obey my confessor, He reassured me in another way, and\ntaught me what I was to say.  He has continued to do so until\nnow; and He gave me reasons so sufficient, that I felt myself\nperfectly safe.\n10. Not long afterwards His Majesty began, according to His\npromise, to make it clear that it was He Himself who appeared, by\nthe growth in me of the love of God so strong, that I knew not\nwho could have infused it; for it was most supernatural, and I\nhad not attained to it by any efforts of my own.  I saw myself\ndying with a desire to see God, and I knew not how to seek that\nlife otherwise than by dying.  Certain great impetuosities [8] of\nlove, though not so intolerable as those of which I have spoken\nbefore, [9] nor yet of so great worth, overwhelmed me.  I knew\nnot what to do; for nothing gave me pleasure, and I had no\ncontrol over myself.  It seemed as if my soul were really torn\naway from myself.  Oh, supreme artifice of our Lord! how tenderly\ndidst Thou deal with Thy miserable slave!  Thou didst hide\nThyself from me, and didst yet constrain me with Thy love, with a\ndeath so sweet, that my soul would never wish it over.\n11. It is not possible for any one to understand these\nimpetuosities if he has not experienced them himself.  They are\nnot an upheaving of the breast, nor those devotional sensations,\nnot uncommon, which seem on the point of causing suffocation, and\nare beyond control.  That prayer is of a much lower order; and\nthose agitations should be avoided by gently endeavouring to be\nrecollected; and the soul should be kept in quiet.  This prayer\nis like the sobbing of little children, who seem on the point of\nchoking, and whose disordered senses are soothed by giving them\nto drink.  So here reason should draw in the reins, because\nnature itself may be contributing to it and we should consider\nwith fear that all this may not be perfect, and that much\nsensuality may be involved in it.  The infant soul should be\nsoothed by the caresses of love, which shall draw forth its love\nin a gentle way, and not, as they say, by force of blows.\nThis love should be inwardly under control, and not as a caldron,\nfiercely boiling because too much fuel has been applied to it,\nand out of which everything is lost.  The source of the fire must\nbe kept under control, and the flame must be quenched in sweet\ntears, and not with those painful tears which come out of these\nemotions, and which do so much harm.\n12. In the beginning, I had tears of this kind.  They left\nme with a disordered head and a wearied spirit, and for a day or\ntwo afterwards unable to resume my prayer.  Great discretion,\ntherefore, is necessary at first, in order that everything may\nproceed gently, and that the operations of the spirit may be\nwithin; all outward manifestations should be carefully avoided.\n13. These other impetuosities are very different.  It is not\nwe who apply the fuel; the fire is already kindled, and we are\nthrown into it in a moment to be consumed.  It is by no efforts\nof the soul that it sorrows over the wound which the absence of\nour Lord has inflicted on it; it is far otherwise; for an arrow\nis driven into the entrails to the very quick, [10] and into the\nheart at times, so that the soul knows not what is the matter\nwith it, nor what it wishes for.  It understands clearly enough\nthat it wishes for God, and that the arrow seems tempered with\nsome herb which makes the soul hate itself for the love of our\nLord, and willingly lose its life for Him.  It is impossible to\ndescribe or explain the way in which God wounds the soul, nor the\nvery grievous pain inflicted, which deprives it of all\nself-consciousness; yet this pain is so sweet, that there is no\njoy in the world which gives greater delight.  As I have just\nsaid, [11] the soul would wish to be always dying of this wound.\n14. This pain and bliss together carried me out of myself,\nand I never could understand how it was.  Oh, what a sight a\nwounded soul is!--a soul, I mean, so conscious of it, as to be\nable to say of itself that it is wounded for so good a cause; and\nseeing distinctly that it never did anything whereby this love\nshould come to it, and that it does come from that exceeding love\nwhich our Lord bears it.  A spark seems to have fallen suddenly\nupon it, that has set it all on fire.  Oh, how often do I\nremember, when in this state, those words of David: \"Quemadmodum\ndesiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum\"! [12] They seem to me to be\nliterally true of myself.\n15. When these impetuosities are not very violent they seem\nto admit of a little mitigation--at least, the soul seeks some\nrelief, because it knows not what to do--through certain\npenances; the painfulness of which, and even the shedding of its\nblood, are no more felt than if the body were dead.  The soul\nseeks for ways and means to do something that may be felt, for\nthe love of God; but the first pain is so great, that no bodily\ntorture I know of can take it away.  As relief is not to be had\nhere, these medicines are too mean for so high a disease.\nSome slight mitigation may be had, and the pain may pass away a\nlittle, by praying God to relieve its sufferings: but the soul\nsees no relief except in death, by which it thinks to attain\ncompletely to the fruition of its good.  At other times, these\nimpetuosities are so violent, that the soul can do neither this\nnor anything else; the whole body is contracted, and neither hand\nnor foot can be moved: if the body be upright at the time, it\nfalls down, as a thing that has no control over itself.\nIt cannot even breathe; all it does is to moan--not loudly,\nbecause it cannot: its moaning, however, comes from a keen sense\nof pain.\n16. Our Lord was pleased that I should have at times a\nvision of this kind: I saw an angel close by me, on my left side,\nin bodily form.  This I am not accustomed to see, unless very\nrarely.  Though I have visions of angels frequently, yet I see\nthem only by an intellectual vision, such as I have spoken of\nbefore. [13]  It was our Lord's will that in this vision I should\nsee the angel in this wise.  He was not large, but small of\nstature, and most beautiful--his face burning, as if he were one\nof the highest angels, who seem to be all of fire: they must be\nthose whom we call cherubim. [14]  Their names they never tell\nme; but I see very well that there is in heaven so great a\ndifference between one angel and another, and between these and\nthe others, that I cannot explain it.\n17. I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the\niron's point there seemed to be a little fire.  He appeared to me\nto be thrusting it at times into my heart, [15] and to pierce my\nvery entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out\nalso, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God.\nThe pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so\nsurpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could\nnot wish to be rid of it.  The soul is satisfied now with nothing\nless than God.  The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the\nbody has its share in it, even a large one.  It is a caressing of\nlove so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God,\nthat I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may\nthink that I am lying. [16]\n18. During the days that this lasted, I went about as if\nbeside myself.  I wished to see, or speak with, no one, but only\nto cherish my pain, which was to me a greater bliss than all\ncreated things could give me. [17]\n19. I was in this state from time to time, whenever it was\nour Lord's pleasure to throw me into those deep trances, which I\ncould not prevent even when I was in the company of others, and\nwhich, to my deep vexation, came to be publicly known.\nSince then, I do not feel that pain so much, but only that which\nI spoke of before,--I do not remember the chapter, [18]--which is\nin many ways very different from it, and of greater worth.\nOn the other hand, when this pain, of which I am now speaking,\nbegins, our Lord seems to lay hold of the soul, and to throw it\ninto a trance, so that there is no time for me to have any sense\nof pain or suffering, because fruition ensues at once.  May He be\nblessed for ever, who hath bestowed such great graces on one who\nhas responded so ill to blessings so great!\n1. Ch. xl.\n2.

When I saw that I was able to do little or nothing towards\navoiding these great impetuosities, I began also to be afraid of\nthem, because I could not understand how this pain and joy could\nsubsist together.  I knew it was possible enough for bodily pain\nand spiritual joy to dwell together; but the coexistence of a\nspiritual pain so excessive as this, and of joy so deep, troubled\nmy understanding.  Still, I tried to continue my resistance; but\nI was so little able, that I was now and then wearied.  I used to\ntake up the cross for protection, and try to defend myself\nagainst Him who, by the cross, is the Protector of us all.  I saw\nthat no one understood me.  I saw it very clearly myself, but I\ndid not dare to say so to any one except my confessor; for that\nwould have been a real admission that I had no humility.\n2. Our Lord was pleased to succour me in a great measure,--and,\nfor the moment, altogether,--by bringing to the place where I was\nthat blessed friar, Peter of Alcantara.  Of him I spoke before,\nand said something of his penance. [1]  Among other things, I\nhave been assured that he wore continually, for twenty years, a\ngirdle made of iron. [2]  He is the author of certain little\nbooks, in Spanish, on prayer, which are now in common use; for,\nas he was much exercised therein, his writings are very\nprofitable to those who are given to prayer.  He kept the first\nrule of the blessed St. Francis in all its rigour, and did those\nthings besides of which I spoke before.\n3. When that widow, the servant of God and my friend, of whom I\nhave already spoken, [3] knew that so great a man had come, she\ntook her measures.  She knew the straits I was in, for she was an\neye-witness of my afflictions, and was a great comfort to me.\nHer faith was so strong, that she could not help believing that\nwhat others said was the work of the devil was really the work of\nthe Spirit of God; and as she is a person of great sense and\ngreat caution, and one to whom our Lord is very bountiful in\nprayer, it pleased His Majesty to let her see what learned men\nfailed to discern.  My confessors gave me leave to accept relief\nin some things from her, because in many ways she was able to\nafford it.  Some of those graces which our Lord bestowed on me\nfell to her lot occasionally, together with instructions most\nprofitable for her soul.  So, then, when she knew that the\nblessed man was come, without saying a word to me, she obtained\nleave from the Provincial for me to stay eight days in her house,\nin order that I might the more easily confer with him.  In that\nhouse, and in one church or another, I had many conversations\nwith him the first time he came here; for, afterwards, I had many\ncommunications with him at diverse times.\n4. I gave him an account, as briefly as I could, of my life, and\nof my way of prayer, with the utmost clearness in my power.\nI have always held to this, to be perfectly frank and exact with\nthose to whom I make known the state of my soul. [4]  Even my\nfirst impulses I wish them to know; and as for doubtful and\nsuspicious matters, I used to make the most of them by arguing\nagainst myself.  Thus, then, without equivocation or concealment,\nI laid before him the state of my soul.  I saw almost at once\nthat he understood me, by reason of his own experience.  That was\nall I required; for at that time I did not know myself as I do\nnow,so as to give an account of my state.  It was at a later time\nthat God enabled me to understand myself, and describe the graces\nwhich His Majesty bestows upon me.  It was necessary, then, that\nhe who would clearly understand and explain my state should have\nhad experience of it himself.\n5. The light he threw on the matter was of the clearest; for as\nto these visions, at least, which were not imaginary, I could not\nunderstand how they could be.  And it seemed that I could not\nunderstand, too, how those could be which I saw with the eyes of\nthe soul; for, as I said before, [5] those visions only seemed to\nme to be of consequence which were seen with the bodily eyes: and\nof these I had none.  The holy man enlightened me on the whole\nquestion, explained it to me, and bade me not to be distressed,\nbut to praise God, and to abide in the full conviction that this\nwas the work of the Spirit of God; for, saving the faith, nothing\ncould be more true, and there was nothing on which I could more\nfirmly rely.  He was greatly comforted in me, was most kind and\nserviceable, and ever afterwards took great care of me, and told\nme of his own affairs and labours; and when he saw that I had\nthose very desires which in himself were fulfilled already,--for\nour Lord had given me very strong desires,--and also how great my\nresolution was, he delighted in conversing with me.\n6. To a person whom our Lord has raised to this state, there is\nno pleasure or comfort equal to that of meeting with another whom\nour Lord has begun to raise in the same way.  At that time,\nhowever, it must have been only a beginning with me, as I\nbelieve; and God grant I may not have gone back now.  He was\nextremely sorry for me.  He told me that one of the greatest\ntrials in this world was that which I had borne,--namely, the\ncontradiction of good people, [6]--and that more was in reserve\nfor me: I had need, therefore, of some one--and there was no one\nin this city--who understood me; but he would speak to my\nconfessor, and to that married nobleman, already spoken of, [7]\nwho was one of those who tormented me most, and who, because of\nhis great affection for me, was the cause of all these attacks.\nHe was a holy but timid man, and could not feel safe about me,\nbecause he had seen how wicked I was, and that not long before.\nThe holy man did so; he spoke to them both, explained the matter,\nand gave them reasons why they should reassure themselves, and\ndisturb me no more.  My confessor was easily satisfied,--not so\nthe nobleman; for though they were not enough to keep him quiet,\nyet they kept him in some measure from frightening me so much as\nhe used to do.\n7. We made an agreement that I should write to him and tell him\nhow it fared with me, for the future, and that we should pray\nmuch for each other.  Such was his humility, that he held to the\nprayers of a wretch like me.  It made me very much ashamed of\nmyself.  He left me in the greatest consolation and joy, bidding\nme continue my prayer with confidence, and without any doubt that\nit was the work of God.  If I should have any doubts, for my\ngreater security, I was to make them known to my confessor, and,\nhaving done so, be in peace.  Nevertheless, I was not able at all\nto feel that confidence, for our Lord was leading me by the way\nof fear; and so, when they told me that the devil had power over\nme, I believed them.  Thus, then, not one of them was able to\ninspire me with confidence on the one hand, or fear on the other,\nin such a way as to make me believe either of them, otherwise\nthan as our Lord allowed me.  Accordingly, though the holy friar\nconsoled and calmed me, I did not rely so much on him as to be\naltogether without fear, particularly when our Lord forsook me in\nthe afflictions of my soul, of which I will now speak.\nNevertheless, as I have said, I was very much consoled.\n8. I could not give thanks enough to God, and to my glorious\nfather St. Joseph, who seemed to me to have brought him here.\nHe was the commissary-general of the custody [8] of St. Joseph,\nto whom, and to our Lady, I used to pray much.\n9. I suffered at times--and even still, though not so often--the\nmost grievous trials, together with bodily pains and afflictions\narising from violent sicknesses; so much so, that I could\nscarcely control myself.  At other times, my bodily sickness was\nmore grievous; and as I had no spiritual pain, I bore it with\ngreat joy: but, when both pains came upon me together, my\ndistress was so heavy, that I was reduced to sore straits.\n10. I forgot all the mercies our Lord had shown me, and\nremembered them only as a dream, to my great distress; for my\nunderstanding was so dull, that I had a thousand doubts and\nsuspicions whether I had ever understood matters aright, thinking\nthat perhaps all was fancy, and that it was enough for me to have\ndeceived myself, without also deceiving good men.  I looked upon\nmyself as so wicked as to have been the cause, by my sins, of all\nthe evils and all the heresies that had sprung up.  This is but a\nfalse humility, and Satan invented it for the purpose of\ndisquieting me, and trying whether he could thereby drive my soul\nto despair.  I have now had so much experience, that I know this\nwas his work; so he, seeing that I understand him, does not\ntorment me in the same way as much as he used to do.  That it is\nhis work is clear from the restlessness and discomfort with which\nit begins, and the trouble it causes in the soul while it lasts;\nfrom the obscurity and distress, the aridity and indisposition\nfor prayer and for every good work, which it produces.  It seems\nto stifle the soul and trammel the body, so as to make them good\nfor nothing.\n11. Now, though the soul acknowledges itself to be miserable, and\nthough it is painful to us to see ourselves as we are, and though\nwe have most deep convictions of our own wickedness,--deep as\nthose spoken of just now, [9] and really felt,--yet true humility\nis not attended with trouble; it does not disturb the soul; it\ncauses neither obscurity nor aridity: on the contrary, it\nconsoles.  It is altogether different, bringing with it calm,\nsweetness, and light.  It is no doubt painful; but, on the other\nhand, it is consoling, because we see how great is the mercy of\nour Lord in allowing the soul to have that pain, and how well the\nsoul is occupied.  On the one hand, the soul grieves over its\noffences against God; on the other, His compassion makes it glad.\nIt has light, which makes it ashamed of itself; and it gives\nthanks to His Majesty, who has borne with it so long.  That other\nhumility, which is the work of Satan, furnishes no light for any\ngood work; it pictures God as bringing upon everything fire and\nsword; it dwells upon His justice; and the soul's faith in the\nmercy of God--for the power of the devil does not reach so far as\nto destroy faith--is of such a nature as to give me no\nconsolation: on the contrary, the consideration of mercies so\ngreat helps to increase the pain, because I look upon myself as\nbound to render greater service.\n12. This invention of Satan is one of the most painful, subtle,\nand crafty that I have known him to possess; I should therefore\nlike to warn you, my father, of it, in order that, if Satan\nshould tempt you herein, you may have some light, and be aware of\nhis devices, if your understanding should be left at liberty:\nbecause you must not suppose that learning and knowledge are of\nany use here; for though I have none of them myself, yet now that\nI have escaped out of his hands I see clearly that this is folly.\nWhat I understood by it is this: that it is our Lord's pleasure\nto give him leave and license, as He gave him of old to tempt\nJob; [10] though in my case, because of my wretchedness, the\ntemptation is not so sharp.\n13. It happened to me to be tempted once in this way; and I\nremember it was on the day before the vigil of Corpus Christi,--a\nfeast to which I have great devotion, though not so great as I\nought to have.  The trial then lasted only till the day of the\nfeast itself.  But, on other occasions, it continued one, two,\nand even three weeks and--I know not--perhaps longer.  But I was\nspecially liable to it during the Holy Weeks, when it was my\nhabit to make prayer my joy.  Then the devil seizes on my\nunderstanding in a moment; and occasionally, by means of things\nso trivial that I should laugh at them at any other time, he\nmakes it stumble over anything he likes.  The soul, laid in\nfetters, loses all control over itself, and all power of thinking\nof anything but the absurdities he puts before it, which, being\nmore or less unsubstantial, inconsistent, and disconnected, serve\nonly to stifle the soul, so that it has no power over itself; and\naccordingly--so it seems to me--the devils make a football of it,\nand the soul is unable to escape out of their hands.  It is\nimpossible to describe the sufferings of the soul in this state.\nIt goes about in quest of relief, and God suffers it to find\nnone.  The light of reason, in the freedom of its will, remains,\nbut it is not clear; it seems to me as if its eyes were covered\nwith a veil.  As a person who, having travelled often by a\nparticular road, knows, though it be night and dark, by his past\nexperience of it, where he may stumble, and where he ought to be\non his guard against that risk, because he has seen the place by\nday, so the soul avoids offending God: it seems to go on by\nhabit--that is, if we put out of sight the fact that our Lord\nholds it by the hand, which is the true explanation of\nthe matter.\n14. Faith is then as dead, and asleep, like all the other\nvirtues; not lost, however,--for the soul truly believes all that\nthe church holds; but its profession of the faith is hardly more\nthan an outward profession of the mouth.  And, on the other hand,\ntemptations seem to press it down, and make it dull, so that its\nknowledge of God becomes to it as that of something which it\nhears of far away.  So tepid is its love that, when it hears God\nspoken of, it listens and believes that He is what He is, because\nthe Church so teaches; but it recollects nothing of its own\nformer experience.  Vocal prayer or solitude is only a greater\naffliction, because the interior suffering--whence it comes, it\nknows not--is unendurable, and, as it seems to me, in some\nmeasure a counterpart of hell.  So it is, as our Lord showed me\nin a vision; [11] for the soul itself is then burning in the\nfire, knowing not who has kindled it, nor whence it comes, nor\nhow to escape it, nor how to put it out: if it seeks relief from\nthe fire by spiritual reading, it cannot find any, just as if it\ncould not read at all.  On one occasion, it occurred to me to\nread a life of a Saint, that I might forget myself, and be\nrefreshed with the recital of what he had suffered.  Four or five\ntimes, I read as many lines; and, though they were written in\nSpanish, I understood them less at the end than I did when I\nbegan: so I gave it up.  It so happened to me on more occasions\nthan one, but I have a more distinct recollection of this.\n15. To converse with any one is worse, for the devil then sends\nso offensive a spirit of bad temper, that I think I could eat\npeople up; nor can I help myself.  I feel that I do something\nwhen I keep myself under control; or rather our Lord does so,\nwhen He holds back with His hand any one in this state from\nsaying or doing something that may be hurtful to his neighbours\nand offensive to God.  Then, as to going to our confessor, that\nis of no use; for the certain result is--and very often has it\nhappened to me--what I shall now describe.  Though my confessors,\nwith whom I had to do then, and have to do still, are so holy,\nthey spoke to me and reproved me with such harshness, that they\nwere astonished at it afterwards when I told them of it.\nThey said that they could not help themselves; for, though they\nhad resolved not to use such language, and though they pitied me\nalso very much,--yea, even had scruples on the subject, because\nof my grievous trials of soul and body,--and were, moreover,\ndetermined to console me, they could not refrain.  They did not\nuse unbecoming words--I mean, words offensive to God; yet their\nwords were the most offensive that could be borne with in\nconfession. They must have aimed at mortifying me.  At other\ntimes, I used to delight in this, and was prepared to bear it;\nbut it was then a torment altogether.  I used to think, too, that\nI deceived them; so I went to them, and cautioned them very\nearnestly to be on their guard against me, for it might be that I\ndeceived them.  I saw well enough that I would not do so\nadvisedly, nor tell them an untruth; [12] but everything made me\nafraid.  One of them, on one occasion, when he had heard me speak\nof this temptation, told me not to distress myself; for, even if\nI wished to deceive him, he had sense enough not to be deceived.\nThis gave me great comfort.\n16. Sometimes, almost always,--at least, very frequently,--I used\nto find rest after Communion; now and then, even, as I drew near\nto the most Holy Sacrament, all at once my soul and body would be\nso well, that I was amazed. [13]  It seemed to be nothing else but\nan instantaneous dispersion of the darkness that covered my soul:\nwhen the sun rose, I saw how silly I had been.\n17. On other occasions, if our Lord spoke to me but one word,\nsaying only, \"Be not distressed, have no fear,\"--as I said\nbefore, [14]--I was made whole at once; or, if I saw a vision, I\nwas as if I had never been amiss.  I rejoiced in God, and made my\ncomplaint to Him, because He permitted me to undergo such\nafflictions; yet the recompense was great; for almost always,\nafterwards, His mercies descended upon me in great abundance.\nThe soul seemed to come forth as gold out of the crucible, most\nrefined, and made glorious to behold, our Lord dwelling within\nit.  These trials afterwards are light, though they once seemed\nto be unendurable; and the soul longs to undergo them again, if\nthat be more pleasing to our Lord.  And though trials and\npersecutions increase, yet, if we bear them without offending our\nLord, rejoicing in suffering for His sake, it will be all the\ngreater gain: I, however, do not bear them as they ought to be\nborne, but rather in a most imperfect way.  At other times, my\ntrials came upon me--they come still--in another form; and then\nit seems to me as if the very possibility of thinking a good\nthought, or desiring the accomplishment of it, were utterly taken\nfrom me: both soul and body are altogether useless and a heavy\nburden.  However, when I am in this state, I do not suffer from\nthe other temptations and disquietudes, but only from a certain\nloathing of I know not what, and my soul finds pleasure\nin nothing.\n18. I used to try exterior good works, in order to occupy myself\npartly by violence; and I know well how weak a soul is when grace\nis hiding itself.  It did not distress me much, because the sight\nof my own meanness gave me some satisfaction. On other occasions,\nI find myself unable to pray or to fix my thoughts with any\ndistinctness upon God, or anything that is good, though I may be\nalone; but I have a sense that I know Him. It is the\nunderstanding and the imagination, I believe, which hurt me here;\nfor it seems to me that I have a good will, disposed for all\ngood; but the understanding is so lost, that it seems to be\nnothing else but a raving lunatic, which nobody can restrain, and\nof which I am not mistress enough to keep it quiet for\na minute. [15]\n19. Sometimes I laugh at myself, and recognise my wretchedness: I\nwatch my understanding, and leave it alone to see what it will\ndo.  Glory be to God, for a wonder, it never runs on what is\nwrong, but only on indifferent things, considering what is going\non here, or there, or elsewhere.  I see then, more and more, the\nexceeding great mercy of our Lord to me, when He keeps this\nlunatic bound in the chains of perfect contemplation.  I wonder\nwhat would happen if those people who think I am good knew of my\nextravagance.  I am very sorry when I see my soul in such bad\ncompany; I long to see it delivered therefrom, and so I say to\nour Lord: When, O my God, shall I see my whole soul praising\nThee, that it may have the fruition of Thee in all its faculties?\nLet me be no longer, O Lord, thus torn to pieces, and every one\nof them, as it were, running in a different direction.  This has\nbeen often the case with me, but I think that my scanty bodily\nhealth was now and then enough to bring it about.\n20. I dwell much on the harm which original sin has done us; that\nis, I believe, what has rendered us incapable of the fruition of\nso great a good.  My sins, too, must be in fault; for, if I had\nnot committed so many, I should have been more perfect in\ngoodness.  Another great affliction which I suffered was this:\nall the books which I read on the subject of prayer, I thought I\nunderstood thoroughly, and that I required them no longer,\nbecause our Lord had given me the gift of prayer.  I therefore\nceased to read those books, and applied myself to lives of\nSaints, thinking that this would improve me and give me courage;\nfor I found myself very defective in every kind of service which\nthe Saints rendered unto God.  Then it struck me that I had very\nlittle humility, when I could think that I had attained to this\ndegree of prayer; and so, when I could not come to any other\nconclusion, I was greatly distressed, until certain learned\npersons, and the blessed friar, Peter of Alcantara, told me not\nto trouble myself about the matter.\n21. I see clearly enough that I have not yet begun to serve God,\nthough He showers down upon me those very graces which He gives\nto many good people.  I am a mass of imperfection, except in\ndesire and in love; for herein I see well that our Lord has been\ngracious to me, in order that I may please Him in some measure.\nI really think that I love Him; but my conduct, and the many\nimperfections I discern in myself, make me sad.\n22. My soul, also, is subject occasionally to a certain\nfoolishness,--that is the right name to give it,--when I seem to\nbe doing neither good nor evil, but following in the wake of\nothers, as they say, without pain or pleasure, indifferent to\nlife and death, pleasure and pain.  I seem to have no feeling.\nThe soul seems to me like a little ass, which feeds and thrives,\nbecause it accepts the food which is given it, and eats it\nwithout reflection.  The soul in this state must be feeding on\nsome great mercies of God, seeing that its miserable life is no\nburden to it, and that it bears it patiently but it is conscious\nof no sensible movements or results, whereby it may ascertain the\nstate it is in.\n23. It seems to me now like sailing with a very gentle wind, when\none makes much way without knowing how; for in the other states,\nso great are the effects, that the soul sees almost at once an\nimprovement in itself, because the desires instantly are on fire,\nand the soul is never satisfied.  This comes from those great\nimpetuosities of love, spoken of before, [16] in those to whom\nGod grants them.  It is like those little wells I have seen\nflowing, wherein the upheaving of the sand never ceases.\nThis illustration and comparison seem to me to be a true\ndescription of those souls who attain to this state; their love\nis ever active, thinking what it may do; it cannot contain\nitself, as the water remains not in the earth, but is continually\nwelling upwards.  So is the soul, in general; it is not at rest,\nnor can it contain itself, because of the love it has: it is so\nsaturated therewith, that it would have others drink of it,\nbecause there is more than enough for itself, in order that they\nmight help it to praise God.\n24. I call to remembrance--oh, how often!--that living water of\nwhich our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman.  That Gospel [17]\nhas a great attraction for me; and, indeed, so it had even when I\nwas a little child, though I did not understand it then as I do\nnow. I used to pray much to our Lord for that living water; and I\nhad always a picture of it, representing our Lord at the well,\nwith this inscription, \"Domine, da mihi aquam.\" [18]\n25. This love is also like a great fire, which requires fuel\ncontinually, in order that it may not burn out.  So those souls I\nam speaking of, however much it may cost them, will always bring\nfuel, in order that the fire may not be quenched.  As for me, I\nshould be glad, considering what I am, if I had but straw even to\nthrow upon it.  And so it is with me occasionally--and, indeed,\nvery often.  At one time, I laugh at myself; and at another, I am\nvery much distressed.  The inward stirring of my love urges me to\ndo something for the service of God; and I am not able to do more\nthan adorn images with boughs and flowers, clean or arrange an\noratory, or some such trifling acts, so that I am ashamed of\nmyself.  If I undertook any penitential practice, the whole was\nso slight, and was done in such a way, that if our Lord did not\naccept my good will, I saw it was all worthless, and so I laughed\nat myself.  The failure of bodily strength, sufficient to do\nsomething for God, is no light affliction for those souls to whom\nHe, in His goodness, has communicated this fire of His love in\nits fulness.  It is a very good penance; for when souls are not\nstrong enough to heap fuel on this fire, and die of fear that the\nfire may go out, it seems to me that they become fuel themselves,\nare reduced to ashes, or dissolved in tears, and burn away: and\nthis is suffering enough, though it be sweet.\n26. Let him, then, praise our Lord exceedingly, who has attained\nto this state; who has received the bodily strength requisite for\npenance; who has learning, ability, and power to preach, to hear\nconfessions, and to draw souls unto God.  Such a one neither\nknows nor comprehends the blessing he possesses, unless he knows\nby experience what it is to be powerless to serve God in\nanything, and at the same time to be receiving much from Him.\nMay He be blessed for ever, and may the angels glorify\nHim!  Amen.\n27. I know not if I do well to write so much in detail.  But as\nyou, my father, bade me again not to be troubled by the\nminuteness of my account, nor to omit anything, I go on\nrecounting clearly and truly all I can call to mind.  But I must\nomit much; for if I did not, I should have to spend more\ntime--and, as I said before, [19] I have so little to spend, and\nperhaps, after all, nothing will be gained.\n1.

Now that I have described certain temptations and troubles,\ninterior and secret, of which Satan was the cause, I will speak\nof others which he wrought almost in public, and in which his\npresence could not be ignored. [1]\n2. I was once in an oratory, when Satan, in an abominable shape,\nappeared on my left hand.  I looked at his mouth in particular,\nbecause he spoke, and it was horrible.  A huge flame seemed to\nissue out of his body, perfectly bright, without any shadow.\nHe spoke in a fearful way, and said to me that, though I had\nescaped out of his hands, he would yet lay hold of me again.\nI was in great terror, made the sign of the cross as well as I\ncould, and then the form vanished--but it reappeared instantly.\nThis occurred twice; I did not know what to do; there was some\nholy water at hand; I took some, and threw it in the direction of\nthe figure, and then Satan never returned.\n3. On another occasion, I was tortured for five hours with such\nterrible pains, such inward and outward sufferings, that it\nseemed to me as if I could not bear them.  Those who were with me\nwere frightened; they knew not what to do, and I could not help\nmyself.  I am in the habit, when these pains and my bodily\nsuffering are most unendurable, to make interior acts as well as\nI can, imploring our Lord, if it be His will, to give me\npatience, and then to let me suffer on, even to the end of the\nworld.  So, when I found myself suffering so cruelly, I relieved\nmyself by making those acts and resolutions, in order that I\nmight be able to endure the pain.  It pleased our Lord to let me\nunderstand that it was the work of Satan; for I saw close beside\nme a most frightful little negro, gnashing his teeth in despair\nat losing what he attempted to seize.  When I saw him, I laughed,\nand had no fear; for there were some then present who were\nhelpless, and knew of no means whereby so great a pain could be\nrelieved.  My body, head, and arms were violently shaken; I could\nnot help myself: but the worst of all was the interior pain, for\nI could find no ease in any way.  Nor did I dare to ask for holy\nwater, lest those who were with me should be afraid, and find out\nwhat the matter really was.\n4. I know by frequent experience that there is nothing which puts\nthe devils to flight like holy water.  They run away before the\nsign of the cross also, but they return immediately: great, then,\nmust be the power of holy water.  As for me, my soul is conscious\nof a special and most distinct consolation whenever I take it.\nIndeed, I feel almost always a certain refreshing, which I cannot\ndescribe, together with an inward joy, which comforts my whole\nsoul.  This is no fancy, nor a thing which has occurred once\nonly; for it has happened very often, and I have watched it very\ncarefully.  I may compare what I feel with that which happens to\na person in great heat, and very thirsty, drinking a cup of cold\nwater--his whole being is refreshed.  I consider that everything\nordained by the Church is very important; and I have a joy in\nreflecting that the words of the Church are so mighty, that they\nendow water with power, so that there shall be so great a\ndifference between holy water and water that has never been\nblessed.  Then, as my pains did not cease, I told them, if they\nwould not laugh, I would ask for some holy water.  They brought\nme some, and sprinkled me with it; but I was no better.  I then\nthrew some myself in the direction of the negro, when he fled in\na moment.  All my sufferings ceased, just as if some one had\ntaken them from me with his hand; only I was wearied, as if I had\nbeen beaten with many blows.  It was of great service to me to\nlearn that if, by our Lord's permission, Satan can do so much\nevil to a soul and body not in his power, he can do much more\nwhen he has them in his possession.  It gave me a renewed desire\nto be delivered from a fellowship so dangerous.\n5. Another time, and not long ago, the same thing happened to me,\nthough it did not last so long, and I was alone at the moment.\nI asked for holy water; and they who came in after the devil had\ngone away,--they were two nuns, worthy of all credit, and would\nnot tell a lie for anything,--perceived a most offensive smell,\nlike that of brimstone.  I smelt nothing myself; but the odour\nlasted long enough to become sensible to them.\n6. On another occasion, I was in choir, when, in a moment, I\nbecame profoundly recollected.  I went out in order that the\nsisters might know nothing of it; yet those who were near heard\nthe sound of heavy blows where I was, and I heard voices myself,\nas of persons in consultation, but I did not hear what they said:\nI was so absorbed in prayer that I understood nothing, neither\nwas I at all afraid.  This took place almost always when our Lord\nwas pleased that some soul or other, persuaded by me, advanced in\nthe spiritual life.  Certainly, what I am now about to describe\nhappened to me once; there are witnesses to testify to it,\nparticularly my present confessor, for he saw the account in a\nletter.  I did not tell him from whom the letter came, but he\nknew perfectly who the person was.\n7. There came to me a person who, for two years and a half, had\nbeen living in mortal sin of the most abominable nature I ever\nheard.  During the whole of that time, he neither confessed it\nnor ceased from it; and yet he said Mass.  He confessed his other\nsins but of this one he used to say, How can I confess so foul a\nsin?  He wished to give it up, but he could not prevail on\nhimself to do so.  I was very sorry for him, and it was a great\ngrief to me to see God offended in such a way.  I promised him\nthat I would pray to God for his amendment, and get others who\nwere better than I to do the same.  I wrote to one person, and\nthe priest undertook to get the letter delivered.  It came to\npass that he made a full confession at the first opportunity; for\nour Lord God was pleased, on account of the prayers of those most\nholy persons to whom I had recommended him, to have pity on this\nsoul.  I, too, wretched as I am, did all I could for the\nsame end.\n8. He wrote to me, and said that he was so far improved, that he\nhad not for some days repeated his sin; but he was so tormented\nby the temptation, that it seemed to him as if he were in hell\nalready, so great were his sufferings.  He asked me to pray to\nGod for him.  I recommended him to my sisters, through whose\nprayers I must have obtained this mercy from our Lord; for they\ntook the matter greatly to heart; and he was a person whom no one\ncould find out.  I implored His Majesty to put an end to these\ntorments and temptations, and to let the evil spirits torment me\ninstead, provided I did not offend our Lord.  Thus it was that\nfor one month I was most grievously tormented; and then it was\nthat these two assaults of Satan, of which I have just spoken,\ntook place.\n9. Our Lord was pleased to deliver him out of this temptation, so\nI was informed; for I told him what happened to myself that\nmonth.  His soul gained strength, and he continued free; he could\nnever give thanks enough to our Lord and to me as if I had been\nof any service--unless it be that the belief he had that our Lord\ngranted me such graces was of some advantage to him.  He said\nthat, when he saw himself in great straits, he would read my\nletters, and then the temptation left him.  He was very much\nastonished at my sufferings, and at the manner of his own\ndeliverance: even I myself am astonished, and I would suffer as\nmuch for many years for the deliverance of that soul.  May our\nLord be praised for ever! for the prayers of those who serve Him\ncan do great things; and I believe the sisters of this house do\nserve Him.  The devils must have been more angry with me only\nbecause I asked them to pray, and because our Lord permitted it\non account of my sins.  At that time, too, I thought the evil\nspirits would have suffocated me one night, and when the sisters\nthrew much holy water about I saw a great troop of them rush away\nas if tumbling over a precipice.  These cursed spirits have\ntormented me so often, and I am now so little afraid of\nthem,--because I see they cannot stir without our Lord's\npermission,--that I should weary both you, my father, and\nmyself, if I were to speak of these things in detail.\n10. May this I have written be of use to the true servant of God,\nwho ought to despise these terrors, which Satan sends only to\nmake him afraid!  Let him understand that each time we despise\nthose terrors, their force is lessened, and the soul gains power\nover them.  There is always some great good obtained; but I will\nnot speak of it, that I may not be too diffuse.  I will speak,\nhowever, of what happened to me once on the night of All Souls.\nI was in an oratory, and, having said one Nocturn, was saying\nsome very devotional prayers at the end of our Breviary, when\nSatan put himself on the book before me, to prevent my finishing\nmy prayer.  I made the sign of the cross, and he went away.\nI then returned to my prayer, and he, too, came back; he did so,\nI believe, three times, and I was not able to finish the prayer\nwithout throwing holy water at him.  I saw certain souls at that\nmoment come forth out of purgatory--they must have been near\ntheir deliverance, and I thought that Satan might in this way\nhave been trying to hinder their release.  It is very rarely that\nI saw Satan assume a bodily form; I know of his presence through\nthe vision I have spoken of before, [2] the vision wherein no\nform is seen.\n11. I wish also to relate what follows, for I was greatly alarmed\nat it: on Trinity Sunday, in the choir of a certain monastery,\nand in a trance, I saw a great fight between evil spirits and the\nangels.  I could not make out what the vision meant.  In less\nthan a fortnight, it was explained clearly enough by the dispute\nthat took place between persons given to prayer and many who were\nnot, which did great harm to that house; for it was a dispute\nthat lasted long and caused much trouble.  On another occasion, I\nsaw a great multitude of evil spirits round about me, and, at the\nsame time, a great light, in which I was enveloped, which kept\nthem from coming near me.  I understood it to mean that God was\nwatching over me, that they might not approach me so as to make\nme offend Him.  I knew the vision was real by what I saw\noccasionally in myself.  The fact is, I know now how little power\nthe evil spirits have, provided I am not out of the grace of God;\nI have scarcely any fear of them at all, for their strength is as\nnothing, if they do not find the souls they assail give up the\ncontest, and become cowards; it is in this case that they show\ntheir power.\n12. Now and then, during the temptations I am speaking of, it\nseemed to me as if all my vanity and weakness in times past had\nbecome alive again within me; so I had reason enough to commit\nmyself into the hands of God.  Then I was tormented by the\nthought that, as these things came back to my memory, I must be\nutterly in the power of Satan, until my confessor consoled me;\nfor I imagined that even the first movement towards an evil\nthought ought not to have come near one who had received from our\nLord such great graces as I had.\n13. At other times, I was much tormented--and even now I am\ntormented--when I saw people make much of me, particularly great\npeople, and when they spake well of me.  I have suffered, and\nstill suffer, much in this way.  I think at once of the life of\nChrist and of the Saints, and then my life seems the reverse of\ntheirs, for they received nothing but contempt and ill-treatment.\nAll this makes me afraid; I dare not lift up my head, and I wish\nnobody saw me at all.  It is not thus with me when I am\npersecuted; then my soul is so conscious of strength, though the\nbody suffers, and though I am in other ways afflicted, that I do\nnot know how this can be; but so it is,--and my soul seems then\nto be a queen in its kingdom, having everything under its feet.\n14. I had such a thought now and then--and, indeed, for many days\ntogether.  I regarded it as a sign of virtue and of humility; but\nI see clearly now it was nothing else but a temptation.\nA Dominican friar, of great learning, showed it to me very\nplainly. When I considered that the graces which our Lord had\nbestowed upon me might come to the knowledge of the public, my\nsufferings became so excessive as greatly to disturb my soul.\nThey went so far, that I made up my mind, while thinking of it,\nthat I would rather be buried alive than have these things known.\nAnd so, when I began to be profoundly recollected, or to fall\ninto a trance, which I could not resist even in public, I was so\nashamed of myself, that I would not appear where people might\nsee me.\n15. Once, when I was much distressed at this, our Lord said to\nme, What was I afraid of? one of two things must happen--people\nwould either speak ill of me, or give glory to Him.  He made me\nunderstand by this, that those who believed in the truth of what\nwas going on in me would glorify Him; and that those who did not\nwould condemn me without cause: in both ways I should be the\ngainer, and I was therefore not to distress myself. [3]  This\nmade me quite calm, and it comforts me whenever I think of it.\n16. This temptation became so excessive, that I wished to leave\nthe house, and take my dower to another monastery, where\nenclosure was more strictly observed than in that wherein I was\nat this time.  I had heard great things of that other house,\nwhich was of the same Order as mine; it was also at a great\ndistance, and it would have been a great consolation to me to\nlive where I was not known; but my confessor would never let me\ngo.  These fears deprived me in a great measure of all liberty of\nspirit; and I understood afterwards that this was not true\nhumility, because it disturbed me so much.  And our Lord taught\nme this truth; if I was convinced, and certainly persuaded, that\nall that was good in me came wholly and only from God, and if it\ndid not distress me to hear the praises of others,--yea, rather,\nif I was pleased and comforted when I saw that God was working in\nthem,--then neither should I be distressed if He showed forth His\nworks in me.\n17. I fell, too, into another extreme.  I begged of God, and made\nit a particular subject of prayer, that it might please His\nMajesty, whenever any one saw any good in me, that such a one\nmight also become acquainted with my sins, in order that he might\nsee that His graces were bestowed on me without any merit on my\npart: and I always greatly desire this.  My confessor told me not\nto do it.  But almost to this day, if I saw that any one thought\nwell of me, I used in a roundabout way, or any how, as I could,\nto contrive he should know of my sins: [4] that seemed to relieve\nme.  But they have made me very scrupulous on this point.\nThis, it appears to me, was not an effect of humility, but\noftentimes the result of temptation.  It seemed to me that I was\ndeceiving everybody--though, in truth, they deceived themselves,\nby thinking that there was any good in me. [5]  I did not wish to\ndeceive them, nor did I ever attempt it, only our Lord permitted\nit for some end; and so, even with my confessors, I never\ndiscussed any of these matters if I did not see the necessity of\nit, for that would have occasioned very considerable scruples.\n18. All these little fears and distresses, and semblance of\nhumility, I now see clearly were mere imperfections, and the\nresult of my unmortified life; for a soul left in the hands of\nGod cares nothing about evil or good report, if it clearly\ncomprehends, when our Lord is pleased to bestow upon it His\ngrace, that it has nothing of its own.  Let it trust the Giver;\nit will know hereafter why He reveals His gifts, and prepare\nitself for persecution, which in these times is sure to come,\nwhen it is our Lord's will it should be known of any one that He\nbestows upon him graces such as these; for a thousand eyes are\nwatching that soul, while a thousand souls of another order are\nobserved of none.  In truth, there was no little ground for fear,\nand that fear should have been mine: I was therefore not humble,\nbut a coward; for a soul which God permits to be thus seen of men\nmay well prepare itself to be the world's martyr--because, if it\nwill not die to the world voluntarily, that very world will\nkill it.\n19. Certainly, I see nothing in the world that seems to me good\nexcept this, that it tolerates no faults in good people, and\nhelps them to perfection by dint of complaints against them.\nI mean, that it requires greater courage in one not yet perfect\nto walk in the way of perfection than to undergo an instant\nmartyrdom; for perfection is not attained to at once, unless our\nLord grant that grace by a special privilege: yet the world, when\nit sees any one beginning to travel on that road, insists on his\nbecoming perfect at once, and a thousand leagues off detects in\nhim a fault, which after all may be a virtue.  He who finds fault\nis doing the very same thing,--but, in his own case,\nviciously,--and he pronounces it to be so wrong in the other.\nHe who aims at perfection, then, must neither eat nor\nsleep,--nor, as they say, even breathe; and the more men respect\nsuch a one, the more do they forget that he is still in the body;\nand, though they may consider him perfect, he is living on the\nearth, subject to its miseries, however much he may tread them\nunder his feet. And so, as I have just said, great courage is\nnecessary here for, though the poor soul have not yet begun to\nwalk, the world will have it fly; and, though its passions be not\nwholly overcome, men will have it that they must be under\nrestraint, even upon trying occasions, as those of the Saints\nare, of whom they read, after they are confirmed in grace.\n20. All this is a reason for praising God, and also for great\nsorrow of heart, because very many go backwards who, poor souls,\nknow not how to help themselves; and I too, I believe, would have\ngone back also, if our Lord had not so mercifully on His part\ndone everything for me.  And until He, of His goodness, had done\nall, nothing was done by me, as you, my father, may have seen\nalready, beyond falling and rising again.  I wish I knew how to\nexplain it, because many souls, I believe, delude themselves in\nthis matter; they would fly before God gives them wings.\n21. I believe I have made this comparison on another\noccasion, [6] but it is to the purpose here, for I see certain\nsouls are very greatly afflicted on that ground.  When these\nsouls begin, with great fervour, courage, and desire, to advance\nin virtue,--some of them, at least outwardly, giving up all for\nGod,--when they see in others, more advanced than themselves,\ngreater fruits of virtue given them by our Lord,--for we cannot\nacquire these of ourselves,--when they see in all the books\nwritten on prayer and on contemplation an account of what we have\nto do in order to attain thereto, but which they cannot\naccomplish themselves,--they lose heart.  For instance, they read\nthat we must not be troubled when men speak ill of us, that we\nare to be then more pleased than when they speak well of us; that\nwe must despise our own good name, be detached from our kindred;\navoid their company, which should be wearisome to us, unless they\nbe given to prayer; with many other things of the same kind.\nThe disposition to practise this must be, in my opinion, the gift\nof God; for it seems to me a supernatural good, contrary to our\nnatural inclinations.  Let them not distress themselves; let them\ntrust in our Lord: what they now desire, His Majesty will enable\nthem to attain to by prayer, and by doing what they can\nthemselves; for it is very necessary for our weak nature that we\nshould have great confidence, that we should not be fainthearted,\nnor suppose that, if we do our best, we shall fail to obtain the\nvictory at last.  And as my experience here is large, I will say,\nby way of caution to you, my father, do not think--though it may\nseem so--that a virtue is acquired when we have not tested it by\nits opposing vice: we must always be suspicious of ourselves, and\nnever negligent while we live; for much evil clings to us if, as\nI said before, [7] grace be not given to us fully to understand\nwhat everything is: and in this life there is nothing without\ngreat risks.\n22. I thought a few years ago, not only that I was detached from\nmy kindred, but that they were a burden to me; and certainly it\nwas so, for I could not endure their conversation.  An affair of\nsome importance had to be settled, and I had to remain with a\nsister of mine, for whom I had always before had a great\naffection.  The conversation we had together, though she is\nbetter than I am, did not please me; for it could not always be\non subjects I preferred, owing to the difference of our\nconditions--she being married.  I was therefore as much alone as\nI could; yet I felt that her troubles gave me more trouble than\ndid those of my neighbours, and even some anxiety.  In short, I\nfound out that I was not so detached as I thought, and that it\nwas necessary for me to flee from dangerous occasions, in order\nthat the virtue which our Lord had begun to implant in me might\ngrow; and so, by His help, I have striven to do from that time\ntill now.\n23. If our Lord bestows any virtue upon us, we must make much of\nit, and by no means run the risk of losing it; so it is in those\nthings which concern our good name, and many other matters.\nYou, my father, must believe that we are not all of us detached,\nthough we think we are; it is necessary for us never to be\ncareless on this point.  If any one detects in himself any\ntenderness about his good name, and yet wishes to advance in the\nspiritual life, let him believe me and throw this embarrassment\nbehind his back, for it is a chain which no file can sever; only\nthe help of God, obtained by prayer and much striving on his\npart, can do it.  It seems to me to be a hindrance on the road,\nand I am astonished at the harm it does.  I see some persons so\nholy in their works, and they are so great as to fill people with\nwonder.  O my God, why is their soul still on the earth?  Why has\nit not arrived at the summit of perfection?  What does it mean?\nWhat keeps him back who does so much for God?  Oh, there it\nis!--self-respect! and the worst of it is, that these persons\nwill not admit that they have it, merely because Satan now and\nthen convinces them that they are under an obligation to\nobserve it.\n24. Well, then, let them believe me: for the love of our Lord,\nlet them give heed to the little ant, who speaks because it is\nHis pleasure.  If they take not this caterpillar away, though it\ndoes not hurt the whole tree, because some virtues remain, the\nworm will eat into every one of them.  Not only is the tree not\nbeautiful, but it also never thrives, neither does it suffer the\nothers near it to thrive; for the fruit of good example which it\nbears is not sound, and endures but a short time.  I say it again\nand again, let our self-respect be ever so slight, it will have\nthe same result as the missing of a note on the organ when it is\nplayed,--the whole music is out of tune.  It is a thing which\nhurts the soul exceedingly in every way, but it is a pestilence\nin the way of prayer.\n25. Are we striving after union with God? and do we wish to\nfollow the counsels of Christ,--who was loaded with reproaches\nand falsely accused,--and, at the same time, to keep our own\nreputation and credit untouched?  We cannot succeed, for these\nthings are inconsistent one with another.  Our Lord comes to the\nsoul when we do violence to ourselves, and strive to give up our\nrights in many things.  Some will say, I have nothing that I can\ngive up, nor have I any opportunity of doing so.  I believe that\nour Lord will never suffer any one who has made so good a\nresolution as this to miss so great a blessing.  His Majesty will\nmake so many arrangements for him, whereby he may acquire this\nvirtue,--more frequently, perhaps, than he will like.  Let him\nput his hand to the work.  I speak of the little nothings and\ntrifles which I gave up when I began--or, at least, of some of\nthem: the straws which I said [8] I threw into the fire; for I am\nnot able to do more.  All this our Lord accepted: may He be\nblessed for evermore!\n26. One of my faults was this: I had a very imperfect knowledge\nof my Breviary and of my duties in choir, simply because I was\ncareless and given to vanities; and I knew the other novices\ncould have taught me.  But I never asked them, that they might\nnot know how little I knew.  It suggested itself to me at once,\nthat I ought to set a good example: this is very common.\nNow, however, that God has opened my eyes a little, even when I\nknow a thing, but yet am very slightly in doubt about it, I ask\nthe children.  I have lost neither honour nor credit by it--on\nthe contrary, I believe our Lord has been pleased to strengthen\nmy memory.  My singing of the Office was bad, and I felt it much\nif I had not learned the part intrusted to me,--not because I\nmade mistakes before our Lord, which would have been a virtue,\nbut because I made them before the many nuns who heard me.  I was\nso full of my own reputation, that I was disturbed, and therefore\ndid not sing what I had to sing even so well as I might have\ndone.  Afterwards, I ventured, when I did not know it very well,\nto say so.  At first, I felt it very much; but afterwards I found\npleasure in doing it.  So, when I began to be indifferent about\nits being known that I could not sing well, it gave me no pain at\nall, and I sang much better.  This miserable self-esteem took\nfrom me the power of doing that which I regarded as an honour,\nfor every one regards as honourable that which he likes.\n27. By trifles such as these, which are nothing,--and I am\naltogether nothing myself, seeing that this gave me pain,--by\nlittle and little, doing such actions, and by such slight\nperformances,--they become of worth because done for God,--His\nMajesty helps us on towards greater things; and so it happened to\nme in the matter of humility.  When I saw that all the nuns\nexcept myself were making great progress,--I was always myself\ngood for nothing,--I used to fold up their mantles when they left\nthe choir.  I looked on myself as doing service to angels who had\nbeen there praising God.  I did so till they--I know not\nhow--found it out; and then I was not a little ashamed, because\nmy virtue was not strong enough to bear that they should know of\nit. But the shame arose, not because I was humble, but because I\nwas afraid they would laugh at me, the matter being so trifling.\n28. O Lord, what a shame for me to lay bare so much wickedness,\nand to number these grains of sand, which yet I did not raise up\nfrom the ground in Thy service without mixing them with a\nthousand meannesses!  The waters of Thy grace were not as yet\nflowing beneath them, so as to make them ascend upwards.  O my\nCreator, oh, that I had anything worth recounting amid so many\nevil things, when I am recounting the great mercies I received at\nThy hands!  So it is, O my Lord.  I know not how my heart could\nhave borne it, nor how any one who shall read this can help\nhaving me in abhorrence when he sees that mercies so great had\nbeen so ill-requited, and that I have not been ashamed to speak\nof these services.  Ah! they are only mine, O my Lord; but I am\nashamed I have nothing else to say of myself; and that it is that\nmakes me speak of these wretched beginnings, in order that he who\nhas begun more nobly may have hope that our Lord, who has made\nmuch of mine, will make more of his.  May it please His Majesty\nto give me this grace, that I may not remain for ever at the\nbeginning!  Amen. [9]\n1. 2 Cor. ii. 11: \"Non enim ignoramus cogitationes ejus.\"\n2.

Don Vicente de la Fuente thinks the first \"Life\" ended here;\nthat which follows was written under obedience to her confessor,\nF. Garcia of Toledo, and after the foundation of the monastery of\nSt. Joseph,\u00a0Avila.\nChapter XXXII.\nOur Lord Shows St. Teresa the Place Which She Had by Her Sins\nDeserved in Hell.  The Torments There.  How the Monastery\nof St. Joseph Was Founded.\n1. Some considerable time after our Lord had bestowed upon me the\ngraces I have been describing, and others also of a higher\nnature, I was one day in prayer when I found myself in a moment,\nwithout knowing how, plunged apparently into hell.  I understood\nthat it was our Lord's will I should see the place which the\ndevils kept in readiness for me, and which I had deserved by my\nsins.  It was but a moment, but it seems to me impossible I\nshould ever forget it even if I were to live many years.\n2. The entrance seemed to be by a long narrow pass, like a\nfurnace, very low, dark, and close.  The ground seemed to be\nsaturated with water, mere mud, exceedingly foul, sending forth\npestilential odours, and covered with loathsome vermin.  At the\nend was a hollow place in the wall, like a closet, and in that I\nsaw myself confined.  All this was even pleasant to behold in\ncomparison with what I felt there.  There is no exaggeration in\nwhat I am saying.\n3. But as to what I then felt, I do not know where to begin, if I\nwere to describe it; it is utterly inexplicable.  I felt a fire\nin my soul.  I cannot see how it is possible to describe it.\nMy bodily sufferings were unendurable.  I have undergone most\npainful sufferings in this life, and, as the physicians say, the\ngreatest that can be borne, such as the contraction of my sinews\nwhen I was paralysed, [1] without speaking of others of different\nkinds, yea, even those of which I have also spoken, [2] inflicted\non me by Satan; yet all these were as nothing in comparison with\nwhat I felt then, especially when I saw that there would be no\nintermission, nor any end to them.\n4. These sufferings were nothing in comparison with the anguish\nof my soul, a sense of oppression, of stifling, and of pain so\nkeen, accompanied by so hopeless and cruel an infliction, that I\nknow not how to speak of it.  If I said that the soul is\ncontinually being torn from the body, it would be nothing, for\nthat implies the destruction of life by the hands of another but\nhere it is the soul itself that is tearing itself in pieces.\nI cannot describe that inward fire or that despair, surpassing\nall torments and all pain.  I did not see who it was that\ntormented me, but I felt myself on fire, and torn to pieces, as\nit seemed to me; and, I repeat it, this inward fire and despair\nare the greatest torments of all.\n5. Left in that pestilential place, and utterly without the power\nto hope for comfort, I could neither sit nor lie down: there was\nno room.  I was placed as it were in a hole in the wall; and\nthose walls, terrible to look on of themselves, hemmed me in on\nevery side.  I could not breathe.  There was no light, but all\nwas thick darkness.  I do not understand how it is; though there\nwas no light, yet everything that can give pain by being seen\nwas visible.\n6. Our Lord at that time would not let me see more of hell.\nAfterwards, I had another most fearful vision, in which I saw the\npunishment of certain sins.  They were most horrible to look at;\nbut, because I felt none of the pain, my terror was not so great.\nIn the former vision, our Lord made me really feel those\ntorments, and that anguish of spirit, just as if I had been\nsuffering them in the body there.  I know not how it was, but I\nunderstood distinctly that it was a great mercy that our Lord\nwould have me see with mine own eyes the very place from which\nHis compassion saved me.  I have listened to people speaking of\nthese things, and I have at other times dwelt on the various\ntorments of hell, though not often, because my soul made no\nprogress by the way of fear; and I have read of the diverse\ntortures, and how the devils tear the flesh with red-hot pincers.\nBut all is as nothing before this; it is a wholly different\nmatter.  In short, the one is a reality, the other a picture; and\nall burning here in this life is as nothing in comparison with\nthe fire that is there.\n7. I was so terrified by that vision,--and that terror is on me\neven now while I am writing,--that, though it took place nearly\nsix years ago, [3] the natural warmth of my body is chilled by\nfear even now when I think of it.  And so, amid all the pain and\nsuffering which I may have had to bear, I remember no time in\nwhich I do not think that all we have to suffer in this world is\nas nothing.  It seems to me that we complain without reason.\nI repeat it, this vision was one of the grandest mercies of our\nLord.  It has been to me of the greatest service, because it has\ndestroyed my fear of trouble and of the contradiction of the\nworld, and because it has made me strong enough to bear up\nagainst them, and to give thanks to our Lord, who has been my\nDeliverer, as it now seems to me, from such fearful and\neverlasting pains.\n8. Ever since that time, as I was saying, everything seems\nendurable in comparison with one instant of suffering such as\nthose I had then to bear in hell.  I am filled with fear when I\nsee that, after frequently reading books which describe in some\nmanner the pains of hell, I was not afraid of them, nor made any\naccount of them.  Where was I?  How could I possibly take any\npleasure in those things which led me directly to so dreadful a\nplace?  Blessed for ever be Thou, O my God! and, oh, how manifest\nis it that Thou didst love me much more than I did love Thee!\nHow often, O Lord, didst Thou save me from that fearful prison!\nand how I used to get back to it contrary to Thy will.\n9. It was that vision that filled me with the very great distress\nwhich I feel at the sight of so many lost souls,--especially of\nthe Lutherans,--for they were once members of the Church by\nbaptism,--and also gave me the most vehement desires for the\nsalvation of souls; for certainly I believe that, to save even\none from those overwhelming torments, I would most willingly\nendure many deaths.  If here on earth we see one whom we\nspecially love in great trouble or pain, our very nature seems to\nbid us compassionate him; and if those pains be great, we are\ntroubled ourselves.  What, then, must it be to see a soul in\ndanger of pain, the most grievous of all pains, for ever?\nWho can endure it?  It is a thought no heart can bear without\ngreat anguish.  Here we know that pain ends with life at last,\nand that there are limits to it; yet the sight of it moves our\ncompassion so greatly.  That other pain has no ending; and I know\nnot how we can be calm, when we see Satan carry so many souls\ndaily away.\n10. This also makes me wish that, in a matter which concerns us\nso much, we did not rest satisfied with doing less than we can do\non our part,--that we left nothing undone.  May our Lord\nvouchsafe to give us His grace for that end!  When I consider\nthat, notwithstanding my very great wickedness, I took some pains\nto please God, and abstained from certain things which I know the\nworld makes light of,--that, in short, I suffered grievous\ninfirmities, and with great patience, which our Lord gave me;\nthat I was not inclined to murmur or to speak ill of anybody;\nthat I could not--I believe so--wish harm to any one; that I was\nnot, to the best of my recollection, either avaricious or\nenvious, so as to be grievously offensive in the sight of God;\nand that I was free from many other faults,--for, though so\nwicked, I had lived constantly in the fear of God,--I had to look\nat the very place which the devils kept ready for me.  It is true\nthat, considering my faults, I had deserved a still heavier\nchastisement; but for all that, I repeat it, the torment was\nfearful, and we run a great risk whenever we please ourselves.\nNo soul should take either rest or pleasure that is liable to\nfall every moment into mortal sin.  Let us, then, for the love of\nGod, avoid all occasions of sin, and our Lord will help us, as He\nhas helped me.  May it please His Majesty never to let me out of\nHis hands, lest I should turn back and fall, now that I have seen\nthe place where I must dwell if I do.  I entreat our Lord, for\nHis Majesty's sake, never to permit it.  Amen.\n11. When I had seen this vision, and had learned other great and\nhidden things which our Lord, of His goodness, was pleased to\nshow me,--namely, the joy of the blessed and the torment of the\nwicked,--I longed for the way and the means of doing penance for\nthe great evil I had done, and of meriting in some degree, so\nthat I might gain so great a good; and therefore I wished to\navoid all society, and to withdraw myself utterly from the world.\nI was in spirit restless, yet my restlessness was not harassing,\nbut rather pleasant.  I saw clearly that it was the work of God,\nand that His Majesty had furnished my soul with fervour, so that\nI might be able to digest other and stronger food than I had been\naccustomed to eat.  I tried to think what I could do for God, and\nthought that the first thing was to follow my vocation to a\nreligious life, which His Majesty had given me, by keeping my\nrule in the greatest perfection possible.\n12. Though in that house in which I then lived there were many\nservants of God, and God was greatly served therein, yet, because\nit was very poor, the nuns left it very often and went to other\nplaces, where, however, we could serve God in all honour and\nobservances of religion.  The rule also was kept, not in its\noriginal exactness, but according to the custom of the whole\nOrder, authorised by the Bull of Mitigation.  There were other\ninconveniences also: we had too many comforts, as it seemed to\nme; for the house was large and pleasant.  But this inconvenience\nof going out, though it was I that took most advantage of it, was\na very grievous one for me; for many persons, to whom my\nsuperiors could not say no, were glad to have me with them.\nMy superiors, thus importuned, commanded me to visit these\npersons; and thus it was so arranged that I could not be long\ntogether in the monastery.  Satan, too, must have had a share in\nthis, in order that I might not be in the house, where I was of\ngreat service to those of my sisters to whom I continually\ncommunicated the instructions which I received from\nmy confessors.\n13. It occurred once to a person with whom I was speaking to say\nto me and the others that it was possible to find means for the\nfoundation of a monastery, if we were prepared to become nuns\nlike those of the Barefooted Orders. [4]  I, having this desire,\nbegan to discuss the matter with that widowed lady who was my\ncompanion,--I have spoken of her before, [5]--and she had the\nsame wish that I had.  She began to consider how to provide a\nrevenue for the home.  I see now that this was not the way,--only\nthe wish we had to do so made us think it was; but I, on the\nother hand, seeing that I took the greatest delight in the house\nin which I was then living, because it was very pleasant to me,\nand, in my own cell, most convenient for my purpose, still held\nback.  Nevertheless, we agreed to commit the matter with all\nearnestness to God.\n14. One day, after Communion, our Lord commanded me to labour\nwith all my might for this end.  He made me great promises,--that\nthe monastery would be certainly built; that He would take great\ndelight therein; that it should be called St. Joseph's; that\nSt. Joseph would keep guard at one door, and our Lady at the\nother; that Christ would be in the midst of us; that the\nmonastery would be a star shining in great splendour; that,\nthough the religious Orders were then relaxed, I was not to\nsuppose that He was scantily served in them,--for what would\nbecome of the world, if there were no religious in it?--I was to\ntell my confessor what He commanded me, and that He asked him not\nto oppose nor thwart me in the matter.\n15. So efficacious was the vision, and such was the nature of the\nwords our Lord spoke to me, that I could not possibly doubt that\nthey came from Him.  I suffered most keenly, because I saw in\npart the great anxieties and troubles that the work would cost\nme, and I was also very happy in the house I was in then; and\nthough I used to speak of this matter in past times, yet it was\nnot with resolution nor with any confidence that the thing could\never be done.  I saw that I was now in a great strait; and when I\nsaw that I was entering on a work of great anxiety, I hesitated;\nbut our Lord spoke of it so often to me, and set before me so\nmany reasons and motives, which I saw could not be gainsaid,--I\nsaw, too, that such was His will; so I did not dare do otherwise\nthan put the whole matter before my confessor, and give him an\naccount in writing of all that took place.\n16. My confessor did not venture definitely to bid me abandon my\npurpose; but he saw that naturally there was no way of carrying\nit out; because my friend, who was to do it, had very little or\nno means available for that end.  He told me to lay the matter\nbefore my superior, [6] and do what he might bid me do.  I never\nspoke of my visions to my superior, but that lady who desired to\nfound the monastery communicated with him.  The Provincial was\nvery much pleased, for he loves the whole Order, gave her every\nhelp that was necessary, and promised to acknowledge the house.\nThen there was a discussion about the revenues of the monastery,\nand for many reasons we never would allow more than thirteen\nsisters together.  Before we began our arrangements, we wrote to\nthe holy friar, Peter of Alcantara, telling him all that was\ntaking place; and he advised us not to abandon our work, and gave\nus his sanction on all points.\n17. As soon as the affair began to be known here, there fell upon\nus a violent persecution, which cannot be very easily\ndescribed--sharp sayings and keen jests.  People said it was\nfolly in me, who was so well off in my monastery; as to my\nfriend, the persecution was so continuous, that it wearied her.\nI did not know what to do, and I thought that people were partly\nin the right.  When I was thus heavily afflicted, I commended\nmyself to God, and His Majesty began to console and encourage me.\nHe told me that I could then see what the Saints had to go\nthrough who founded the religious Orders: that I had much heavier\npersecutions to endure than I could imagine, but I was not to\nmind them.  He told me also what I was to say to my friend; and\nwhat surprised me most was, that we were consoled at once as to\nthe past, and resolved to withstand everybody courageously.\nAnd so it came to pass; for among people of prayer, and indeed in\nthe whole neighbourhood, there was hardly one who was not against\nus, and who did not think our work the greatest folly.\n18. There was so much talking and confusion in the very monastery\nwherein I was, that the Provincial began to think it hard for him\nto set himself against everybody; so he changed his mind, and\nwould not acknowledge the new house.  He said that the revenue\nwas not certain, and too little, while the opposition was great.\nOn the whole, it seemed that he was right; he gave it up at last,\nand would have nothing to do with it.  It was a very great pain\nto us,--for we seemed now to have received the first blow,--and\nin particular to me, to find the Provincial against us; for when\nhe approved of the plan, I considered myself blameless before\nall.  They would not give absolution to my friend, if she did not\nabandon the project; for they said she was bound to remove\nthe scandal.\n19. She went to a very learned man, and a very great servant of\nGod, of the Order of St. Dominic, [7] to whom she gave an account\nof all this matter.  This was even before the Provincial had\nwithdrawn his consent; for in this place we had no one who would\ngive us advice; and so they said that it all proceeded solely\nfrom our obstinacy.  That lady gave an account of everything, and\ntold the holy man how much she received from the property of her\nhusband.  Having, a great desire that he would help us,--for he\nwas the most learned man here, and there are few in his Order\nmore learned than he,--I told him myself all we intended to do,\nand some of my motives.  I never said a word of any revelation\nwhatever, speaking only of the natural reasons which influenced\nme; for I would not have him give an opinion otherwise than on\nthose grounds.  He asked us to give him eight days before he\nanswered, and also if we had made up our minds to abide by what\nhe might say.  I said we had; but though I said so, and though I\nthought so, I never lost a certain confidence that the monastery\nwould be founded.  My friend had more faith than I; nothing they\ncould say could make her give it up.  As for myself, though, as I\nsaid, it seemed to me impossible that the work should be finally\nabandoned, yet my belief in the truth of the revelation went no\nfurther than in so far as it was not against what is contained in\nthe sacred writings, nor against the laws of the Church, which we\nare bound to keep.  Though the revelation seemed to me to have\ncome really from God, yet, if that learned man had told me that\nwe could not go on without offending God and going against our\nconscience, I believe I should have given it up, and looked out\nfor some other way; but our Lord showed me no other way\nthan this.\n20. The servant of God told me afterwards that he had made up his\nmind to insist on the abandonment of our project, for he had\nalready heard the popular cry: moreover, he, as everybody did,\nthought it folly; and a certain nobleman also, as soon as he knew\nthat we had gone to him, had sent him word to consider well what\nhe was doing, and to give us no help; that when he began to\nconsider the answer he should make us, and to ponder on the\nmatter, the object we had in view, our manner of life, and the\nOrder, he became convinced that it was greatly for the service of\nGod, and that we must not give it up.  Accordingly, his answer\nwas that we should make haste to settle the matter.  He told us\nhow and in what way it was to be done; and if our means were\nscanty, we must trust somewhat in God.  If anyone made any\nobjections, they were to go to him--he would answer them; and in\nthis way he always helped us, as I shall show by and by. [8]\n21. This answer was a great comfort to us; so also was the\nconduct of certain holy persons who were usually against us: they\nwere now pacified, and some of them even helped us.  One of them\nwas the saintly nobleman [9] of whom I spoke before; [10] he\nlooked on it--so, indeed, it was--as a means of great perfection,\nbecause the whole foundation was laid in prayer.  He saw also\nvery many difficulties before us, and no way out of them,--yet he\ngave up his own opinion, and admitted that the work might be of\nGod.  Our Lord Himself must have touched his heart, as He also\ndid that of the doctor, the priest and servant of God, to whom,\nas I said before, [11] I first spoke, who is an example to the\nwhole city,--being one whom God maintains there for the relief\nand progress of many souls: he, too, came now to give us\nhis assistance.\n22. When matters had come to this state, and always with the help\nof many prayers, we purchased a house in a convenient spot; and\nthough it was small, I cared not at all for that, for our Lord\nhad told me to go into it as well as I could,--that I should see\nafterwards what He would do; and how well I have seen it!  I saw,\ntoo, how scanty were our means; and yet I believed our Lord\nwould order these things by other ways, and be gracious unto us.\n1. See ch. v. \u00a7 14, ch. vi. \u00a7 1.\n2.

When the matter was in this state--so near its conclusion,\nthat on the very next day the papers were to be signed--then it\nwas that the Father Provincial changed his mind.  I believe that\nthe change was divinely ordered--so it appeared afterwards; for\nwhile so many prayers were made, our Lord was perfecting His work\nand arranging its execution in another way.  When the Provincial\nrefused us, my confessor bade me forthwith to think no more of\nit, notwithstanding the great trouble and distress which our Lord\nknows it cost me to bring it to this state.  When the work was\ngiven up and abandoned, people were the more convinced that it\nwas altogether the foolishness of women; and the complaints\nagainst me were multiplied, although I had until then this\ncommandment of my Provincial to justify me.\n2. I was now very much disliked throughout the whole monastery,\nbecause I wished to found another with stricter enclosure.\nIt was said I insulted my sisters; that I could serve God among\nthem as well as elsewhere, for there were many among them much\nbetter than I; that I did not love the house, and that it would\nhave been better if I had procured greater resources for it than\nfor another.  Some said I ought to be put in prison; others--but\nthey were not many--defended me in some degree.  I saw well\nenough that they were for the most part right, and now and then I\nmade excuses for myself; though, as I could not tell them the\nchief reason, which was the commandment of our Lord, I knew not\nwhat to do, and so was silent.\n3. In other respects God was most merciful unto me, for all this\ncaused me no uneasiness; and I gave up our design with much\nreadiness and joy, as if it cost me nothing.  No one could\nbelieve it, not even those men of prayer with whom I conversed;\nfor they thought I was exceedingly pained and sorry: even my\nconfessor himself could hardly believe it.  I had done, as it\nseemed to me, all that was in my power.  I thought myself obliged\nto do no more than I had done to fulfil our Lord's commandment,\nand so I remained in the house where I was, exceedingly happy and\njoyful; though, at the same time, I was never able to give up my\nconviction that the work would be done.  I had now no means of\ndoing it, nor did I know how or when it would be done; but I\nfirmly believed in its accomplishment.\n4. I was much distressed at one time by a letter which my\nconfessor wrote to me, as if I had done anything in the matter\ncontrary to his will.  Our Lord also must have meant that\nsuffering should not fail me there where I should feel it most;\nand so, amid the multitude of my persecutions, when, as it seemed\nto me, consolations should have come from my confessor, he told\nme that I ought to recognise in the result that all was a dream;\nthat I ought to lead a new life by ceasing to have anything to do\nfor the future with it, or even to speak of it any more, seeing\nthe scandal it had occasioned.  He made some further remarks, all\nof them very painful.  This was a greater affliction to me than\nall the others together.  I considered whether I had done\nanything myself, and whether I was to blame for anything that was\nan offence unto God; whether all my visions were illusions, all\nmy prayers a delusion, and I, therefore, deeply deluded and lost.\nThis pressed so heavily upon me, that I was altogether disturbed\nand most grievously distressed.  But our Lord, who never failed\nme in all the trials I speak of, so frequently consoled and\nstrengthened me, that I need not speak of it here.  He told me\nthen not to distress myself; that I had pleased God greatly, and\nhad not sinned against Him throughout the whole affair; that I\nwas to do what my confessors required of me, and be silent on the\nsubject till the time came to resume it.  I was so comforted and\nso happy, that the persecution which had befallen me seemed to be\nas nothing at all.\n5. Our Lord now showed me what an exceedingly great blessing it\nis to be tried and persecuted for His sake; for the growth of the\nlove of God in my soul, which I now discerned, as well as of many\nother virtues, was such as to fill me with wonder.  It made me\nunable to abstain from desiring trials, and yet those about me\nthought I was exceedingly disheartened; and I must have been so,\nif our Lord in that extremity had not succoured me with His great\ncompassion.  Now was the beginning of those more violent\nimpetuosities of the love of God of which I have spoken\nbefore, [1] as well as of those profounder trances.  I kept\nsilence, however, and never spoke of those graces to any one.\nThe saintly Dominican [2] was as confident as I was that the work\nwould be done; and as I would not speak of it, in order that\nnothing might take place contrary to the obedience I owed my\nconfessor, he communicated with my companion, and they wrote\nletters to Rome and made their preparations.\n6. Satan also contrived now that persons should hear one from\nanother that I had had a revelation in the matter; and people\ncame to me in great terror, saying that the times were dangerous,\nthat something might be laid to my charge, and that I might be\ntaken before the Inquisitors.  I heard this with pleasure, and it\nmade me laugh, because I never was afraid of them; for I knew\nwell enough that in matters of faith I would not break the least\nceremony of the Church, that I would expose myself to die a\nthousand times rather than that any one should see me go against\nit or against any truth of Holy Writ.  So I told them I was not\nafraid of that, for my soul must be in a very bad state if there\nwas anything the matter with it of such a nature as to make me\nfear the Inquisition; I would go myself and give myself up, if I\nthought there was anything amiss; and if I should be denounced,\nour Lord would deliver me, and I should gain much.\n7. I had recourse to my Dominican father; for I could rely upon\nhim, because he was a learned man.  I told him all about my\nvisions, my way of prayer, the great graces our Lord had given\nme, as clearly as I could, and I begged him to consider the\nmatter well, and tell me if there was anything therein at\nvariance with the Holy Writings, and give me his opinion on the\nwhole matter.  He reassured me much, and, I think, profited\nhimself; for though he was exceedingly good, yet, from this time\nforth, he gave himself more and more to prayer, and retired to a\nmonastery of his Order which was very lonely, that he might apply\nhimself more effectually to prayer, where he remained more than\ntwo years.  He was dragged out of his solitude by obedience, to\nhis great sorrow: his superiors required his services; for he was\na man of great ability.  I, too, on my part, felt his retirement\nvery much, because it was a great loss to me, though I did not\ndisturb him.  But I knew it was a gain to him; for when I was so\nmuch distressed at his departure, our Lord bade me be comforted,\nnot to take it to heart, for he was gone under good guidance.\n8. So, when he came back, his soul had made such great progress,\nand he was so advanced in the ways of the spirit, that he told me\non his return he would not have missed that journey for anything\nin the world.  And I, too, could say the same thing; for where he\nreassured and consoled me formerly by his mere learning, he did\nso now through that spiritual experience he had gained of\nsupernatural things.  And God, too, brought him here in time; for\nHe saw that his help would be required in the foundation of the\nmonastery, which His Majesty willed should be laid.\n9. I remained quiet after this for five or six months, neither\nthinking nor speaking of the matter; nor did our Lord once speak\nto me about it.  I know not why, but I could never rid myself of\nthe thought that the monastery would be founded.  At the end of\nthat time, the then Rector [3] of the Society of Jesus having\ngone away, His Majesty brought into his place another, [4] of\ngreat spirituality, high courage, strong understanding, and\nprofound learning, at the very time when I was in great straits.\nAs he who then heard my confession had a superior over him--the\nfathers of the Society are extremely strict about the virtue of\nobedience and never stir but in conformity with the will of their\nsuperiors,--so he would not dare, though he perfectly understood\nmy spirit, and desired the accomplishment of my purpose, to come\nto any resolution; and he had many reasons to justify his\nconduct.  I was at the same time subject to such great\nimpetuosities of spirit, that I felt my chains extremely heavy;\nnevertheless, I never swerved from the commandment he gave me.\n10. One day, when in great distress, because I thought my\nconfessor did not trust me, our Lord said to me, Be not troubled;\nthis suffering will soon be over.  I was very much delighted,\nthinking I should die shortly; and I was very happy whenever I\nrecalled those words to remembrance.  Afterwards I saw clearly\nthat they referred to the coming of the rector of whom I am\nspeaking, for never again had I any reason to be distressed.\nThe rector that came never interfered with the father-minister\nwho was my confessor.  On the contrary, he told him to console\nme,--that there was nothing to be afraid of,--and not to direct\nme along a road so narrow, but to leave the operations of the\nSpirit of God alone; for now and then it seemed as if these great\nimpetuosities of the spirit took away the very breath of\nthe soul.\n11. The rector came to see me, and my confessor bade me speak to\nhim in all freedom and openness.  I used to feel the very\ngreatest repugnance to speak of this matter; but so it was, when\nI went into the confessional, I felt in my soul something, I know\nnot what.  I do not remember to have felt so either before or\nafter towards any one.  I cannot tell what it was, nor do I know\nof anything with which I could compare it.  It was a spiritual\njoy, and a conviction in my soul that his soul must understand\nmine, that it was in unison with it, and yet, as I have said, I\nknew not how.  If I had ever spoken to him, or had heard great\nthings of him, it would have been nothing out of the way that I\nshould rejoice in the conviction that he would understand me; but\nhe had never spoken to me before, nor I to him, and, indeed, he\nwas a person of whom I had no previous knowledge whatever.\n12. Afterwards, I saw clearly that my spirit was not deceived;\nfor my relations with him were in every way of the utmost service\nto me and my soul, because his method of direction is proper for\nthose persons whom our Lord seems to have led far on the way,\nseeing that He makes them run, and not to crawl step by step.\nHis plan is to render them thoroughly detached and mortified, and\nour Lord has endowed him with the highest gifts herein as well as\nin many other things beside.  As soon as I began to have to do\nwith him, I knew his method at once, and saw that he had a pure\nand holy soul, with a special grace of our Lord for the\ndiscernment of spirits.  He gave me great consolation.\nShortly after I had begun to speak to him, our Lord began to\nconstrain me to return to the affair of the monastery, and to lay\nbefore my confessor and the father-rector many reasons and\nconsiderations why they should not stand in my way.  Some of\nthese reasons made them afraid, for the father-rector never had a\ndoubt of its being the work of the Spirit of God, because he\nregarded the fruits of it with great care and attention.  At\nlast, after much consideration, they did not dare to\nhinder me. [5]\n13. My confessor gave me leave to prosecute the work with all my\nmight.  I saw well enough the trouble I exposed myself to, for I\nwas utterly alone, and able to do so very little.  We agreed that\nit should be carried on with the utmost secrecy; and so I\ncontrived that one of my sisters, [6] who lived out of the town,\nshould buy a house, and prepare it as if for herself, with money\nwhich our Lord provided for us. [7]  I made it a great point to\ndo nothing against obedience; but I knew that if I spoke of it to\nmy superiors all was lost, as on the former occasion, and worse\neven might happen.  In holding the money, in finding the house,\nin treating for it, in putting it in order, I had so much to\nsuffer; and, for the most part, I had to suffer alone, though my\nfriend did what she could: she could do but little, and that was\nalmost nothing.  Beyond giving her name and her countenance, the\nwhole of the trouble was mine; and that fell upon me in so many\nways, that I am astonished now how I could have borne it. [8]\nSometimes, in my affliction, I used to say: O my Lord, how is it\nthat Thou commandest me to do that which seems impossible?--for,\nthough I am a woman, yet, if I were free, it might be done; but\nwhen I am tied in so many ways, without money, or the means of\nprocuring it, either for the purpose of the Brief or for any\nother,--what, O Lord, can I do?\n14. Once when I was in one of my difficulties, not knowing what\nto do, unable to pay the workmen, St. Joseph, my true father and\nlord, appeared to me, and gave me to understand that money would\nnot be wanting, and I must hire the workmen.  So I did, though I\nwas penniless; and our Lord, in a way that filled those who heard\nof it with wonder, provided for me.  The house offered me was too\nsmall,--so much so, that it seemed as if it could never be made\ninto a monastery,--and I wished to buy another, but had not the\nmeans, and there was neither way nor means to do so. I knew not\nwhat to do.  There was another little house close to the one we\nhad, which might have formed a small church.  One day, after\nCommunion, our Lord said to me, I have already bidden thee to go\nin anyhow.  And then, as if exclaiming, said: Oh, covetousness of\nthe human race, thinking that even the whole earth is too little\nfor it! how often have I slept in the open air, because I had no\nplace to shelter Me! [9]  I was alarmed, and saw that He had good\nreasons to complain.  I went to the little house, arranged the\ndivisions of it, and found that it would make a sufficient,\nthough small, monastery.  I did not care now to add to the site\nby purchase, and so I did nothing but contrive to have it\nprepared in such a way that it could be lived in.  Everything was\ncoarse, and nothing more was done to it than to render it not\nhurtful to health--and that must be done everywhere.\n15. As I was going to Communion on her feast, St. Clare appeared\nto me in great beauty, and bade me take courage, and go on with\nwhat I had begun; she would help me.  I began to have a great\ndevotion to St. Clare; and she has so truly kept her word, that a\nmonastery of nuns of her Order in our neighbourhood helped us to\nlive; and, what is of more importance, by little and little she\nso perfectly fulfilled my desire, that the poverty which the\nblessed Saint observes in her own house is observed in this, and\nwe are living on alms.  It cost me no small labour to have this\nmatter settled by the plenary sanction and authority of the Holy\nFather, [10] so that it shall never be otherwise, and we possess\nno revenues.  Our Lord is doing more for us--perhaps we owe it to\nthe prayers of this blessed Saint; for, without our asking\nanybody, His Majesty supplies most abundantly all our wants.\nMay He be blessed for ever!  Amen.\n16. On one of these days--it was the Feast of the Assumption of\nour Lady--I was in the church of the monastery of the Order of\nthe glorious St. Dominic, thinking of the events of my wretched\nlife, and of the many sins which in times past I had confessed in\nthat house.  I fell into so profound a trance, that I was as it\nwere beside myself.  I sat down, and it seemed as if I could\nneither see the Elevation nor hear Mass.  This afterwards became\na scruple to me.  I thought then, when I was in that state, that\nI saw myself clothed with a garment of excessive whiteness and\nsplendour.  At first I did not see who was putting it on me.\nAfterwards I saw our Lady on my right hand, and my father\nSt. Joseph on my left, clothing me with that garment.  I was\ngiven to understand that I was then cleansed from my sins.\nWhen I had been thus clad--I was filled with the utmost delight\nand joy--our Lady seemed at once to take me by both hands.\nShe said that I pleased her very much by being devout to the\nglorious St. Joseph; that I might rely on it my desires about the\nmonastery were accomplished, and that our Lord and they too would\nbe greatly honoured in it; that I was to be afraid of no failure\nwhatever, though the obedience under which it would be placed\nmight not be according to my mind, because they would watch over\nus, and because her Son had promised to be with us [11]--and, as\na proof of this, she would give me that jewel.  She then seemed\nto throw around my neck a most splendid necklace of gold, from\nwhich hung a cross of great value.  The stones and gold were so\ndifferent from any in this world, that there is nothing wherewith\nto compare them.  The beauty of them is such as can be conceived\nby no imagination,--and no understanding can find out the\nmaterials of the robe, nor picture to itself the splendours which\nour Lord revealed, in comparison with which all the splendours of\nearth, so to say, are a daubing of soot.  This beauty, which I\nsaw in our Lady, was exceedingly grand, though I did not trace it\nin any particular feature, but rather in the whole form of her\nface. She was clothed in white and her garments shone with\nexcessive lustre that was not dazzling, but soft.  I did not see\nSt. Joseph so distinctly, though I saw clearly that he was there,\nas in the visions of which I spoke before, [12] in which nothing\nis seen.  Our Lady seemed to be very young.\n17. When they had been with me for a while,--I, too, in the\ngreatest delight and joy, greater than I had ever had before, as\nI think, and with which I wished never to part,--I saw them, so\nit seemed, ascend up to heaven, attended by a great multitude of\nangels.  I was left in great loneliness, though so comforted and\nraised up, so recollected in prayer and softened, that I was for\nsome time unable to move or speak--being, as it were, beside\nmyself.  I was now possessed by a strong desire to be consumed\nfor the love of God, and by other affections of the same kind.\nEverything took place in such a way that I could never have a\ndoubt--though I often tried--that the vision came from God. [13]\nIt left me in the greatest consolation and peace.\n18. As to that which the Queen of the Angels spoke about\nobedience, it is this: it was painful to me not to subject the\nmonastery to the Order, and our Lord had told me that it was\ninexpedient to do so.  He told me the reasons why it was in no\nwise convenient that I should do it but I must send to Rome in a\ncertain way, which He also explained; He would take care that I\nfound help there: and so I did.  I sent to Rome, as our Lord\ndirected me,--for we should never have succeeded otherwise,--and\nmost favourable was the result.\n19. And as to subsequent events, it was very convenient to be\nunder the Bishop, [14] but at that time I did not know him, nor\ndid I know what kind of a superior he might be.  It pleased our\nLord that he should be as good and favourable to this house as it\nwas necessary he should be on account of the great opposition it\nmet with at the beginning, as I shall show hereafter, [15] and\nalso for the sake of bringing it to the condition it is now in.\nBlessed be He who has done it all!  Amen.\n1. Ch. xxi. \u00a7 6, ch. xxix. \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11.\n2. Pedro Iba\u00f1ez.  See ch. xxxviii. \u00a7 15.\n3. Dionisio Vasquez.

Gaspar de Salazar was made rector of the house in Avila in\n1561, therein succeeding Vasquez (Bollandists,\u00a0ibid.).\n5. St. Teresa was commanded by our Lord to ask Father Baltasar\nAlvarez to make a meditation on Psalm xci. 6: \"Quam magnificata\nsunt opera Tua.\"  The Saint obeyed, and the meditation was made.\nFrom that moment, as F.

One day, she went with her sister--she was staying in her\nhouse--to hear a sermon in the church of St. Thomas.  The zealous\npreacher denounced visions and revelations; and his observations\nwere so much to the point, that there was no need of his saying\nthat they were directed against St. Teresa, who was present.\nHer sister was greatly hurt, and persuaded the Saint to return to\nthe monastery at once (Reforma, i. ch. xlii. \u00a7\u00a01).\n9.

Now, though I was very careful that no one should know what we\nwere doing, all this work could not be carried on so secretly as\nnot to come to the knowledge of divers persons; some believed, in\nit, others did not, I was in great fear lest the Provincial\nshould be spoken to about it when he came, and find himself\ncompelled to order me to give it up; and if he did so, it would\nhave been abandoned at once.  Our Lord provided against it in\nthis way.  In a large city, more than twenty leagues distant, was\na lady in great distress on account of her husband's death. [1]\nShe was in such extreme affliction, that fears were entertained\nabout her life.  She had heard of me, a poor sinner,--for our\nLord had provided that,--and men spoke well to her of me, for the\nsake of other good works which resulted from it.  This lady knew\nthe Provincial well; and as she was a person of some\nconsideration, and knew that I lived in a monastery the nuns of\nwhich were permitted to go out, our Lord made her desire much to\nsee me.  She thought that my presence would be a consolation to\nher, and that she could not be comforted otherwise.\nShe therefore strove by all the means in her power to get me into\nher house, sending messages to the Provincial, who was at a\ndistance far away.\n2. The Provincial sent me an order, charging me in virtue of my\nobedience to go immediately, with one companion.  I knew of it on\nChristmas night.  It caused me some trouble and much suffering to\nsee that they sent for me because they thought there was some\ngood in me; I, knowing myself to be so wicked, could not bear it.\nI commended myself earnestly to God, and during Matins, or the\ngreater part of them, was lost in a profound trance.  Our Lord\ntold me I must go without fail, and give no heed to the opinions\nof people, for they were few who would not be rash in their\ncounsel; and though I should have troubles, yet God would be\nserved greatly: as to the monastery, it was expedient I should be\nabsent till the Brief came, because Satan had contrived a great\nplot against the coming of the Provincial; that I was to have no\nfear,--He would help me.  I repeated this to the rector, and he\ntold me that I must go by all means, though others were saying I\nought not to go, that it was a trick of Satan to bring some evil\nupon me there, and that I ought to send word to the Provincial.\n3. I obeyed the rector, and went without fear, because of what I\nhad understood in prayer, though in the greatest confusion when I\nthought of the reasons why they sent for me, and how very much\nthey were deceived.  It made me more and more importunate with\nour Lord that He would not abandon me.  It was a great comfort\nthat there was a house of the Society of Jesus there whither I\nwas going, and so I thought I should be in some degree safe under\nthe direction of those fathers, as I had been here.\n4. It was the good pleasure of our Lord that the lady who sent\nfor me should be so much consoled that a visible improvement was\nthe immediate result she was comforted every day more and more.\nThis was very remarkable, because, as I said before, her\nsuffering had reduced her to great straits.  Our Lord must have\ndone this in answer to the many prayers which the good people of\nmy acquaintance made for me, that I might prosper in my work.\nShe had a profound fear of God, and was so good, that her great\ndevotion supplied my deficiencies.  She conceived a great\naffection for me--I, too, for her, because of her goodness; but\nall was as it were a cross for me; for the comforts of her house\nwere a great torment, and her making so much of me made me\nafraid.  I kept my soul continually recollected--I did not dare\nto be careless: nor was our Lord careless of me; for while I was\nthere, He bestowed the greatest graces upon me, and those graces\nmade me so free, and filled me with such contempt for all I\nsaw,--and the more I saw, the greater my contempt,--that I never\nfailed to treat those ladies, whom to serve would have been a\ngreat honour for me, with as much freedom as if I had been\ntheir equal.\n5. I derived very great advantages from this, and I said so.\nI saw that she was a woman, and as much liable to passion and\nweakness as I was; that rank is of little worth, and the higher\nit is, the greater the anxiety and trouble it brings.\nPeople must be careful of the dignity of their state, which will\nnot suffer them to live at ease; they must eat at fixed hours and\nby rule, for everything must be according to their state, and not\naccording to their constitutions; and they have frequently to\ntake food fitted more for their state than for their liking.\n6. So it was that I came to hate the very wish to be a great\nlady.  God deliver me from this wicked, artificial life!--though\nI believe that this lady, notwithstanding that she was one of the\nchief personages of the realm, was a woman of great simplicity,\nand that few were more humble than she was.  I was very sorry for\nher, for I saw how often she had to submit to much that was\ndisagreeable to her, because of the requirements of her rank.\nThen, as to servants, though this lady had very good servants,\nhow slight is that little trust that may be put in them!\nOne must not be conversed with more than another; otherwise, he\nwho is so favoured is envied by the rest.  This of itself is a\nslavery, and one of the lies of the world is that it calls such\npersons masters, who, in my eyes, are nothing else but slaves in\na thousand ways.\n7. It was our Lord's pleasure that the household of that lady\nimproved in the service of His Majesty during my stay there,\nthough I was not exempted from some trials and some jealousies on\nthe part of some of its members, because of the great affection\ntheir mistress had for me.  They perhaps must have thought I had\nsome personal interest to serve.  Our Lord must have permitted\nsuch matters, and others of the same kind, to give me trouble, in\norder that I might not be absorbed in the comforts which\notherwise I had there; and He was pleased to deliver me out of it\nall with great profit to my soul.\n8. When I was there, a religious person of great consideration,\nand with whom I had conversed occasionally some years ago, [2]\nhappened to arrive.  When I was at Mass, in a monastery of his\nOrder, near the house in which I was staying, I felt a longing to\nknow the state of his soul,--for I wished him to be a great\nservant of God,--and I rose up in order to go and speak to him.\nBut as I was then recollected in prayer, it seemed to me a waste\nof time--for what had I to do in that matter?--and so I returned\nto my place.  Three times, I think I did this, and at last my\ngood angel prevailed over the evil one, and I went and asked for\nhim; and he came to speak to me in one of the confessionals.\nWe began by asking one another of our past lives, for we had not\nseen one another for many years.  I told him that my life had\nbeen one in which my soul had had many trials.  He insisted much\non my telling him what those trials were.  I said that they were\nnot to be told, and that I was not to tell them.  He replied that\nthe Dominican father, [3] of whom I have spoken, knew them, and\nthat, as they were great friends, he could learn them from him,\nand so I had better tell them without hesitation.\n9. The fact is, that it was not in his power not to insist, nor\nin mine, I believe, to refuse to speak; for notwithstanding all\nthe trouble and shame I used to feel formerly, I spoke of my\nstate, to him, and to the rector whom I have referred to\nbefore, [4] without any difficulty whatever; on the contrary, it\nwas a great consolation to me; and so I told him all in\nconfession.  He seemed to me then more prudent than ever; though\nI had always looked upon him as a man of great understanding.\nI considered what high gifts and endowments for great services he\nhad, if he gave himself wholly unto God.  I had this feeling now\nfor many years, so that I never saw any one who pleased me much\nwithout wishing at once he were given wholly unto God; and\nsometimes I feel this so keenly, that I can hardly contain\nmyself.  Though I long to see everybody serve God, yet my desire\nabout those who please me is very vehement, and so I importune\nour Lord on their behalf.\n10. So it happened with respect to this religious.  He asked me\nto pray much for him to God.  There was no necessity for his\ndoing so, because I could not do anything else, and so I went\nback to my place where I was in the habit of praying alone, and\nbegan to pray to our Lord, being extremely recollected, in that\nmy simple, silly way, when I speak without knowing very often\nwhat I am saying.  It is love that speaks, and my soul is so\nbeside itself, that I do not regard the distance between it and\nGod.  That love which I know His Majesty has for it makes it\nforget itself, and think itself to be one with Him; and so, as\nbeing one with Him, and not divided from Him, the soul speaks\nfoolishly.  When I had prayed with many tears that the soul of\nthis religious might serve Him truly,--for, though I considered\nit good, it was not enough for me; I would have it much\nbetter,--I remember I said, \"O Lord, Thou must not refuse me this\ngrace; behold him,--he is a fit person to be our friend.\"\n11. Oh, the great goodness and compassion of God!  How He regards\nnot the words, but the desire and the will with which they are\nspoken!  How He suffered such a one as I am to speak so boldly\nbefore His Majesty!  May He be blessed for evermore!\n12. I remember that during those hours of prayer on that very\nnight I was extremely distressed by the thought whether I was in\nthe grace of God, and that I could never know whether I was so or\nnot,--not that I wished to know it; I wished, however, to die, in\norder that I might not live a life in which I was not sure that I\nwas not dead in sin, for there could be no death more dreadful\nfor me than to think that I had sinned against God.  I was in\ngreat straits at this thought.  I implored Him not to suffer me\nto fall into sin, with great sweetness, dissolved in tears.\nThen I heard that I might console myself, and trust [5] that I\nwas in a state of grace, because a love of God like mine,\ntogether with the graces and feelings with which His Majesty\nfilled my soul, was of such a nature as to be inconsistent with a\nstate of mortal sin.\n13. I was now confident that our Lord would grant my prayer as to\nthat religious.  He bade me repeat certain words to him.  This I\nfelt much, because I knew not how to speak to him; for this\ncarrying messages to a third person, as I have said, [6] is what\nI have always felt the most, especially when I did not know how\nthat person would take them, nor whether he would not laugh at\nme.  This placed me in great difficulties, but at last I was so\nconvinced I ought to do it, that I believe I made a promise to\nGod I would not neglect that message; and because of the great\nshame I felt, I wrote it out, and gave it in that way.\nThe result showed clearly enough that it was a message from God,\nfor that religious resolved with great earnestness to give\nhimself to prayer, though he did not do so at once.  Our Lord\nwould have him for Himself, so He sent me to tell him certain\ntruths which, without my understanding them, were so much to the\npurpose that he was astonished.  Our Lord must have prepared him\nto receive them as from His Majesty; and though I am but a\nmiserable sinner myself, yet I made many supplications to our\nLord to convert him thoroughly, and to make him hate the\npleasures and the things of this life.  And so he did--blessed be\nGod!--for every time that he spoke to me I was in a manner beside\nmyself; and if I had not seen it, I should never have believed\nthat our Lord would have given him in so short a time graces so\nmatured, and filled him so full of God, that he seemed to be\nalive to nothing on earth.\n14. May His Majesty hold him in His hand!  If he will go on--and\nI trust in our Lord he will do so, now that he is so well\ngrounded in the knowledge of himself--he will be one of the most\ndistinguished servants of God, to the great profit of many souls,\nbecause he has in a short time had great experience in spiritual\nthings: that is a gift of God, which He gives when He will and as\nHe will, and it depends not on length of time nor extent of\nservice.  I do not mean that time and service, are not great\nhelps, but very often our Lord will not give to some in twenty\nyears the grace of contemplation, while He gives it to others in\none,--His Majesty knoweth why.  We are under a delusion when we\nthink that in the course of years we shall come to the knowledge\nof that which we can in no way attain to but by experience; and\nthus many are in error, as I have said [7] when they would\nunderstand spirituality without being spiritual themselves.  I do\nnot mean that a man who is not spiritual, if he is learned, may\nnot direct one that is spiritual; but it must be understood that\nin outward and inward things, in the order of nature, the\ndirection must be an act of reason; and in supernatural things,\naccording to the teaching of the sacred writings.  In other\nmatters, let him not distress himself, nor think that he can\nunderstand that which he understandeth not; neither let him\nquench the Spirit; [8] for now another Master, greater than he,\nis directing these souls, so that they are not left without\nauthority over them.\n15. He must not be astonished at this, nor think it impossible:\nall things are possible to our Lord; [9] he must strive rather to\nstrengthen his faith, and humble himself, because in this matter\nour Lord imparts perhaps a deeper knowledge to some old woman\nthan to him, though he may be a very learned man.  Being thus\nhumble, he will profit souls and himself more than if he affected\nto be a contemplative without being so; for, I repeat it, if he\nhave no experience, if he have not a most profound humility,\nwhereby he may see that he does not understand, and that the\nthing is not for that reason impossible, he will do himself but\nlittle good, and still less to his penitent.  But if he is\nhumble, let him have no fear that our Lord will allow either the\none or the other to fall into delusion.\n16. Now as to this father I am speaking of, as our Lord has given\nhim light in many things, so has he laboured to find out by study\nthat which in this matter can be by study ascertained; for he is\na very learned man, and that of which he has no experience\nhimself he seeks to find out from those who have it,--and our\nLord helps him by increasing his faith, and so he has greatly\nbenefited himself and some other souls, of whom mine is one.\nAs our Lord knew the trials I had to undergo, His Majesty seems\nto have provided that, when He took away unto Himself some of\nthose who directed me, others might remain, who helped me in my\ngreat afflictions, and rendered me great services.\n17. Our Lord wrought a complete change in this father, so much so\nthat he scarcely knew himself, so to speak.  He has given him\nbodily health, so that he may do penance, such as he never had\nbefore; for he was sickly.  He has given him courage to undertake\ngood works, with other gifts, so that he seems to have received a\nmost special vocation from our Lord.  May He be blessed for ever!\n18. All these blessings, I believe, came to him through the\ngraces our Lord bestowed upon him in prayer; for they are real.\nIt has been our Lord's pleasure already to try him in certain\ndifficulties, out of which he has come forth like one who knows\nthe true worth of that merit which is gained by suffering\npersecutions.  I trust in the munificence of our Lord that great\ngood will, by his means, accrue to some of his Order and to the\nOrder itself.  This is beginning to be understood.  I have had\ngreat visions on the subject, and our Lord has told me wonderful\nthings of him and of the Rector of the Society of Jesus, whom I\nam speaking of, [10] and also of two other religious of the Order\nof St. Dominic, particularly of one who, to his own profit, has\nactually learned of our Lord certain things which I had formerly\nunderstood of him.  But there were greater things made known of\nhim to whom I am now referring: one of them I will now relate.\n19. I was with him once in the parlour, when in my soul and\nspirit I felt what great love burned within him, and became as it\nwere lost in ecstasy by considering the greatness of God, who had\nraised that soul in so short a time to a state so high.  It made\nme ashamed of myself when I saw him listen with so much humility\nto what I was saying about certain matters of prayer, when I had\nso little myself that I could speak on the subject to one like\nhim.  Our Lord must have borne with me in this on account of the\ngreat desire I had to see that religious making great progress.\nMy interview with him did me great good,--it seems as if it left\na new fire in my soul, burning with desire to serve our Lord as\nin the beginning.  O my Jesus! what is a soul on fire with Thy\nlove!  How we ought to prize it, and implore our Lord to let it\nlive long upon earth!  He who has this love should follow after\nsuch souls, if it be possible.\n20. It is a great thing for a person ill of this disease to find\nanother struck down by it,--it comforts him much to see that he\nis not alone; they help one another greatly to suffer and to\nmerit.  They are strong with a double strength who are resolved\nto risk a thousand lives for God, and who long for an opportunity\nof losing them.  They are like soldiers who, to acquire booty,\nand therewith enrich themselves, wish for war, knowing well that\nthey cannot become rich without it.  This is their work--to\nsuffer.  Oh, what a blessing it is when our Lord gives light to\nunderstand how great is the gain of suffering for Him!  This is\nnever understood till we have left all things; for if anybody is\nattached to any one thing, that is a proof that he sets some\nvalue upon it; and if he sets any value upon it, it is painful to\nbe compelled to give it up.  In that case, everything is\nimperfect and lost.  The saying is to the purpose here,--he who\nfollows what is lost, is lost himself; and what greater loss,\nwhat greater blindness, what greater calamity, can there be than\nmaking much of that which is nothing!\n21. I now return to that which I had begun to speak of.  I was in\nthe greatest joy, beholding that soul.  It seemed as if our Lord\nwould have me see clearly the treasures He had laid up in it; and\nso, when I considered the favour our Lord had shown me, in that I\nshould be the means of so great a good, I recognised my own\nunworthiness for such an end.  I thought much of the graces our\nLord had given him, and held myself as indebted for them more\nthan if they had been given to myself.  So I gave thanks to our\nLord, when I saw that His Majesty had fulfilled my desires and\nheard my petition that He would raise up persons like him.\nAnd now my soul, no longer able to bear the joy that filled it,\nwent forth out of itself, losing itself that it might gain the\nmore. It lost sight of the reflections it was making; and the\nhearing of that divine language which the Holy Ghost seemed to\nspeak threw me into a deep trance, which almost deprived me of\nall sense, though it did not last long.  I saw Christ, in\nexceeding great majesty and glory, manifesting His joy at what\nwas then passing.  He told me as much, and it was His pleasure\nthat I should clearly see that He was always present at similar\ninterviews, and how much He was pleased when people thus found\ntheir delight in speaking of Him.\n22. On another occasion, when far away from this place, I saw him\ncarried by angels in great glory.  I understood by that vision\nthat his soul was making great progress: so it was; for an evil\nreport was spread abroad against him by one to whom he had\nrendered a great service, and whose reputation and whose soul he\nhad saved.  He bore it with much joy.  He did also other things\ngreatly to the honour of God, and underwent more persecutions.\nI do not think it expedient now to speak further on this point;\nif, however, you, my father, who know all, should hereafter think\notherwise, more might be said to the glory of our Lord.\n23. All the prophecies spoken of before, [11] relating to this\nhouse, as well as others, of which I shall speak hereafter,\nrelating to it and to other matters, have been accomplished.\nSome of them our Lord revealed to me three years before they\nbecame known, others earlier and others later.  But I always made\nthem known to my confessor, and to the widow my friend; for I had\nleave to communicate with her, as I said before. [12]  She, I\nknow, repeated them to others, and these know that I lie not.\nMay God never permit me, in any matter whatever,--much more in\nthings of this importance,--to say anything but the whole truth!\n24. One of my brothers-in-law [13] died suddenly; and as I was in\ngreat distress at this, because he had no opportunity of making\nhis confession, our Lord said to me in prayer that my sister also\nwas to die in the same way; that I must go to her, and make her\nprepare herself for such an end.  I told this to my confessor;\nbut as he would not let me go, I heard the same warning again;\nand now, when he saw this, he told me I might go, and that I\nshould lose nothing by going.  My sister was living in the\ncountry; and as I did not tell her why I came, I gave her what\nlight I could in all things.  I made her go frequently to\nconfession, and look to her soul in everything.  She was very\ngood, and did as I asked her.  Four or five years after she had\nbegun this practice, and keeping a strict watch over her\nconscience, she died, with nobody near her, and without being\nable to go to confession.  This was a blessing to her, for it was\nlittle more than a week since she had been to her accustomed\nconfession.  It was a great joy to me when I heard of her death.\nShe was but a short time in purgatory.\n25. I do not think it was quite eight days afterwards when, after\nCommunion, our Lord appeared to me, and was pleased that I should\nsee Him receive my sister into glory.  During all those years,\nafter our Lord had spoken to me, until her death, what I then\nlearnt with respect to her was never forgotten either by myself\nor by my friend, who, when my sister was thus dead, came to me in\ngreat amazement at the fulfilment of the prophecy.  God be\npraised for ever, who takes such care of souls that they may not\nbe lost!\n1. Do\u00f1a Luisa de la Cerda, sister of the Duke of Medina-Coeli,\nwas now the widow of Arias Pardo, Marshal of Castille, Lord of\nMalagon and Paracuellos.  Don Arias was nephew of Cardinal\nTabera, Archbishop of Toledo (De la\u00a0Fuente).\n2. F. Vicente Barron, Dominican (see ch. v. \u00a7 8), according to\nF. Bouix, on the authority of Ribera and Yepez; but the Carmelite\nFather, Fr. Antonio of St. Joseph, in his note on the first\nFragment (Letters, vol. iv. p. 408), says that it was Fr. Garcia\nof Toledo, brother of Don Fernando, Duke of Alva; and Don Vicente\nde la Fuente thinks the opinion of Fr. Antonio the more\u00a0probable.\n3. Pedro Iba\u00f1ez (Bouix).\n4. Ch. xxxiii. \u00a7 11.\n5. Father Bouix says that here the word \"confiar,\" \"trust,\" in\nthe printed text, has been substituted by some one for the words\n\"estar cierta,\" \"be certain,\" which he found in the MS.  But Don\nVicente de la Fuente retains the old reading \"confiar,\" and makes\nno observation on the alleged discrepancy between the MS. and the\nprinted text.  The observation of F. Bouix, however, is more\nimportant, and deserves credit,--for Don Vicente may have failed,\nthrough mere inadvertence, to see what F. Bouix saw; and it is\nalso to be remembered that Don Vicente does not say that the\nMS. on this point has been so closely inspected as to throw any\ndoubt on the positive testimony of F. Bouix.  Six years after\nthis note was written Don Vicente published a facsimile by\nphotography of the original text in the handwriting of the Saint,\npreserved in the Escurial.  The words are not \"confiar,\" but\n\"estar\u00a0cierta.\"\n6. Ch. xxxiii. \u00a7 12.\n7. Ch. xiv. \u00a7 10.\n8. 1 Thess. v. 19: \"Spiritum nolite extinguere.\"\n9.

How the Saint Left Toledo.\n1. When I was staying with this lady, [1] already spoken of, in\nwhose house I remained more than six months, our Lord ordained\nthat a holy woman [2] of our Order should hear of me, who was\nmore than seventy leagues away from the place.  She happened to\ntravel this way, and went some leagues out of her road that she\nmight see me.  Our Lord had moved her in the same year, and in\nthe same month of the year, that He had moved me, to found\nanother monastery of the Order; and as He had given her this\ndesire, she sold all she possessed, and went to Rome to obtain\nthe necessary faculties.  She went on foot, and barefooted.\nShe is a woman of great penance and prayer, and one to whom our\nLord gave many graces; and our Lady appeared to her, and\ncommanded her to undertake this work.  Her progress in the\nservice of our Lord was so much greater than mine, that I was\nashamed to stand in her presence.  She showed me Briefs she\nbrought from Rome, and during the fortnight she remained with me\nwe laid our plan for the founding of these monasteries.\n2. Until I spoke to her, I never knew that our rule, before it\nwas mitigated, required of us that we should possess nothing; [3]\nnor was I going to found a monastery without revenue, [4] for my\nintention was that we should be without anxiety about all that\nwas necessary for us, and I did not think of the many anxieties\nwhich the possession of property brings in its train.  This holy\nwoman, taught of our Lord, perfectly understood--though she could\nnot read--what I was ignorant of, notwithstanding my having read\nthe Constitutions [5] so often; and when she told me of it, I\nthought it right, though I feared they would never consent to\nthis, but would tell me I was committing follies, and that I\nought not to do anything whereby I might bring suffering upon\nothers.  If this concerned only myself, nothing should have kept\nme back,--on the contrary, it would have been my great joy to\nthink that I was observing the counsels of Christ our Lord; for\nHis Majesty had already given me great longings for poverty. [6]\n3. As for myself, I never doubted that this was the better part;\nfor I had now for some time wished it were possible in my state\nto go about begging, for the love of God--to have no house of my\nown, nor anything else.  But I was afraid that others--if our\nLord did not give them the same desire--might live in discontent.\nMoreover, I feared that it might be the cause of some\ndistraction: for I knew some poor monasteries not very\nrecollected, and I did not consider that their not being\nrecollected was the cause of their poverty, and that their\npoverty was not the cause of their distraction: distraction never\nmakes people richer, and God never fails those who serve Him.\nIn short, I was weak in faith; but not so this servant of God.\n4. As I took the advice of many in everything, I found scarcely\nany one of this opinion--neither my confessor, nor the learned\nmen to whom I spoke of it.  They gave me so many reasons the\nother way, that I did not know what to do.  But when I saw what\nthe rule required, and that poverty was the more perfect way, I\ncould not persuade myself to allow an endowment.  And though they\ndid persuade me now and then that they were right, yet, when I\nreturned to my prayer, and saw Christ on the cross, so poor and\ndestitute, I could not bear to be rich, and I implored Him with\ntears so to order matters that I might be poor as He was.\n5. I found that so many inconveniences resulted from an\nendowment, and saw that it was the cause of so much trouble, and\neven distraction, that I did nothing but dispute with the\nlearned.  I wrote to that Dominican friar [7] who was helping us,\nand he sent back two sheets by way of reply, full of objections\nand theology against my plan, telling me that he had thought much\non the subject.  I answered that, in order to escape from my\nvocation, the vow of poverty I had made, and the perfect\nobservance of the counsels of Christ, I did not want any theology\nto help me, and in this case I should not thank him for his\nlearning.  If I found any one who would help me, it pleased me\nmuch.  The lady in whose house I was staying was a great help to\nme in this matter.  Some at first told me that they agreed with\nme; afterwards, when they had considered the matter longer, they\nfound in it so many inconveniences that they insisted on my\ngiving it up.  I told them that, though they changed their\nopinion so quickly, I would abide by the first.\n6. At this time, because of my entreaties,--for the lady had\nnever seen the holy friar, Peter of Alcantara,--it pleased our\nLord to bring him to her house.  As he was a great lover of\npoverty, and had lived in it for so many years, he knew well the\ntreasures it contains, and so he was a great help to me; he\ncharged me on no account whatever to give up my purpose.\nNow, having this opinion and sanction,--no one was better able to\ngive it, because he knew what it was by long experience,--I  made\nup my mind to seek no further advice.\n7. One day, when I was very earnestly commending the matter to\nGod, our Lord told me that I must by no means give up my purpose\nof founding the monastery in poverty; it was His will, and the\nwill of His Father: He would help me.  I was in a trance; and the\neffects were such, that I could have no doubt it came from God.\nOn another occasion, He said to me that endowments bred\nconfusion, with other things in praise of poverty; and assured me\nthat whosoever served Him would never be in want of the necessary\nmeans of living: and this want, as I have said, [8] I never\nfeared myself.  Our Lord changed the dispositions also of the\nlicentiate,--I am speaking of the Dominican friar, [9]--who, as I\nsaid, wrote to me that I should not found the monastery without\nan endowment.  Now, I was in the greatest joy at hearing this;\nand having these opinions in my favour, it seemed to me nothing\nless than the possession of all the wealth of the world, when I\nhad resolved to live in poverty for the love of God.\n8. At this time, my Provincial withdrew the order and the\nobedience, in virtue of which I was staying in that house. [10]\nHe left it to me to do as I liked: if I wished to return I might\ndo so; if I wished to remain I might also do so for a certain\ntime. But during that time the elections in my monastery [11]\nwould take place and I was told that many of the nuns wished to\nlay on me the burden of superiorship.  The very thought of this\nalone was a great torment to me; for though I was resolved to\nundergo readily any kind of martyrdom for God, I could not\npersuade myself at all to accept this; for, putting aside the\ngreat trouble it involved,--because the nuns were so many,--and\nother reasons, such as that I never wished for it, nor for any\nother office,--on the contrary, had always refused them,--it\nseemed to me that my conscience would be in great danger; and so\nI praised God that I was not then in my convent.  I wrote to my\nfriends and asked them not to vote for me.\n9. When I was rejoicing that I was not in that trouble, our Lord\nsaid to me that I was on no account to keep away; that as I\nlonged for a cross, there was one ready for me, and that a heavy\none: that I was not to throw it away, but go on with resolution;\nHe would help me, and I must go at once.  I was very much\ndistressed, and did nothing but weep, because I thought that my\ncross was to be the office of prioress; and, as I have just said,\nI could not persuade myself that it would be at all good for my\nsoul--nor could I see any means by which it would be.  I told my\nconfessor of it, and he commanded me to return at once: that to\ndo so was clearly the most perfect way; and that, because the\nheat was very great,--it would be enough if I arrived before the\nelection,--I might wait a few days, in order that my journey\nmight do me no harm.\n10. But our Lord had ordered it otherwise.  I had to go at once,\nbecause the uneasiness I felt was very great; and I was unable to\npray, and thought I was failing in obedience to the commandments\nof our Lord, and that as I was happy and contented where I was, I\nwould not go to meet trouble.  All my service of God there was\nlip-service: why did I, having the opportunity of living in\ngreater perfection, neglect it?  If I died on the road, let me\ndie.  Besides, my soul was in great straits, and our Lord had\ntaken from me all sweetness in prayer.  In short, I was in such a\nstate of torment, that I begged the lady to let me go; for my\nconfessor, when he saw the plight I was in, had already told me\nto go, God having moved him as He had moved me.  The lady felt my\ndeparture very much, and that was another pain to bear; for it\nhad cost her much trouble, and diverse importunities of the\nProvincial, to have me in her house.\n11. I considered it a very great thing for her to have given her\nconsent, when she felt it so much; but, as she was a person who\nfeared God exceedingly,--and as I told her, among many other\nreasons, that my going away tended greatly to His service, and\nheld out the hope that I might possibly return,--she gave way,\nbut with much sorrow.  I was now not sorry myself at coming away,\nfor I knew that it was an act of greater perfection, and for the\nservice of God.  So the pleasure I had in pleasing God took away\nthe pain of quitting that lady,--whom I saw suffering so\nkeenly,--and others to whom I owed much, particularly my\nconfessor of the Society of Jesus, in whom I found all I needed.\nBut the greater the consolations I lost for our Lord's sake, the\ngreater was my joy in losing them.  I could not understand it,\nfor I had a clear consciousness of these two contrary\nfeelings--pleasure, consolation, and joy in that which weighed\ndown my soul with sadness.  I was joyful and tranquil, and had\nopportunities of spending many hours in prayer; and I saw that I\nwas going to throw myself into a fire; for our Lord had already\ntold me that I was going to carry a heavy cross,--though I never\nthought it would be so heavy as I afterwards found it to be,--yet\nI went forth rejoicing.  I was distressed because I had not\nalready begun the fight, since it was our Lord's will that I\nshould be in it.  Thus His Majesty gave me strength, and\nestablished it in my weakness. [12]\n12. As I have just said, I could not understand how this could\nbe.  I thought of this illustration: if I were possessed of a\njewel, or any other thing which gave me great pleasure, and it\ncame to my knowledge that a person whom I loved more than myself,\nand whose satisfaction I preferred to my own, wished to have it,\nit would give me great pleasure to deprive myself of it, because\nI would give all I possessed to please that person.  Now, as the\npleasure of giving pleasure to that person surpasses any pleasure\nI have in that jewel myself, I should not be distressed in giving\naway that or anything else I loved, nor at the loss of that\npleasure which the possession of it gave me.  So now, though I\nwished to feel some distress when I saw that those whom I was\nleaving felt my going so much, yet, notwithstanding my naturally\ngrateful disposition,--which, under other circumstances, would\nhave been enough to have caused me great pain,--at this time,\nthough I wished to feel it, I could feel none.\n13. The delay of another day was so serious a matter in the\naffairs of this holy house, that I know not how they would have\nbeen settled if I had waited.  Oh, God is great!  I am often lost\nin wonder when I consider and see the special help which His\nMajesty gave me towards the establishment of this little cell of\nGod,--for such I believe it to be,--the lodging wherein His\nMajesty delights; for once, when I was in prayer, He told me that\nthis house was the paradise of his delight. [13]  It seems, then,\nthat His Majesty has chosen these whom he has drawn hither, among\nwhom I am living very much ashamed of myself. [14]  I could not\nhave even wished for souls such as they are for the purpose of\nthis house, where enclosure, poverty, and prayer are so strictly\nobserved; they submit with so much joy and contentment, that\nevery one of them thinks herself unworthy of the grace of being\nreceived into it,--some of them particularly; for our Lord has\ncalled them out of the vanity and dissipation of the world, in\nwhich, according to its laws, they might have lived contented.\nOur Lord has multiplied their joy, so that they see clearly how\nHe had given them a hundredfold for the one thing they have\nleft, [15] and for which they cannot thank His Majesty enough.\nOthers He has advanced from well to better.  To the young He\ngives courage and knowledge, so that they may desire nothing\nelse, and also to understand that to live away from all things in\nthis life is to live in greater peace even here below.  To those\nwho are no longer young, and whose health is weak, He gives--and\nhas given--the strength to undergo the same austerities and\npenance with all the others.\n14. O my Lord! how Thou dost show Thy power!  There is no need to\nseek reasons for Thy will; for with Thee, against all natural\nreason, all things are possible: so that thou teachest clearly\nthere is no need of anything but of loving Thee [16] in earnest,\nand really giving up everything for Thee, in order that Thou, O\nmy Lord, might make everything easy.  It is well said that Thou\nfeignest to make Thy law difficult: [17] I do not see it, nor do\nI feel that the way that leadeth unto Thee is narrow. I see it as\na royal road, and not a pathway; a road upon which whosoever\nreally enters, travels most securely.  No mountain passes and no\ncliffs are near it: these are the occasions of sin. I call that a\npass,--a dangerous pass,--and a narrow road, which has on one\nside a deep hollow, into which one stumbles, and on the other a\nprecipice, over which they who are careless fall, and are dashed\nto pieces.  He who loves Thee, O my God, travels safely by the\nopen and royal road, far away from the precipice: he has scarcely\nstumbled at all, when Thou stretchest forth Thy hand to save him.\nOne fall--yea, many falls--if he does but love Thee, and not the\nthings of the world, are not enough to make him perish; he\ntravels in the valley of humility.  I cannot understand what it\nis that makes men afraid of the way of perfection.\n15. May our Lord of His mercy make us see what a poor security we\nhave in the midst of dangers so manifest, when we live like the\nrest of the world; and that true security consists in striving to\nadvance in the way of God!  Let us fix our eyes upon Him, and\nhave no fear that the Sun of justice will ever set, or suffer us\nto travel to our ruin by night, unless we first look away from\nHim.  People are not afraid of living in the midst of lions,\nevery one of whom seems eager to tear them: I am speaking of\nhonours, pleasures, and the like joys, as the world calls them:\nand herein the devil seems to make us afraid of ghosts.  I am\nastonished a thousand times, and ten thousand times would I\nrelieve myself by weeping, and proclaim aloud my own great\nblindness and wickedness, if, perchance, it might help in some\nmeasure to open their eyes.  May He, who is almighty, of His\ngoodness open their eyes, and never suffer mine to be\nblind again!\n1. Do\u00f1a Luisa de la Cerda.\n2. Maria of Jesus was the daughter of a Reporter of Causes in the\nChancery of Granada; but his name and that of his wife are not\nknown.  Maria married, but became a widow soon afterwards.\nShe then became a novice in the Carmelite monastery in Granada,\nand during her noviciate had revelations, like those of\nSt. Teresa, about a reform of the Order.  Her confessor made\nlight of her revelations, and she then referred them to F. Gaspar\nde Salazar, a confessor of St. Teresa, who was then in Granada.\nHe approved of them, and Maria left the noviciate, and went to\nRome with two holy women of the Order of St. Francis.  The three\nmade the journey on foot, and, moreover, barefooted.  Pope Pius\nIV. heard her prayer, and, looking at her torn and bleeding feet,\nsaid to her, \"Woman of strong courage, let it be as thou wilt.\"\nShe returned to Granada, but both the Carmelites and the city\nrefused her permission to found her house there, and some went so\nfar as to threaten to have her publicly whipped.  Do\u00f1a Leonor de\nMascare\u00f1as gave her a house in Alcala de Henares, of which she\ntook possession Sept. 11, 1562; but the house was formally\nconstituted July 23, 1563, and subjected to the Bishop ten days\nafter (Reforma, i. c. 59; and Don Vicente, vol. i. p. 255).\nThe latter says that the Chronicler is in error when he asserts\nthat this monastery of Maria of Jesus was\u00a0endowed.\n3. The sixth chapter of the rule is: \"Nullus fratrum sibi aliquid\nproprium, esse dicat, sed sint vobis omnia\u00a0communia.\"\n4. See ch. xxxii. \u00a7 13.\n5. The Constitutions which the Saint read in the Monastery of the\nIncarnation must have been the Constitutions grounded on the\nMitigated Rule which was sanctioned by Eugenius IV. (Romani\nPontificis, A.D.\u00a01432).\n6. See Relation, i. \u00a7 10.\n7. F. Pedro Iba\u00f1ez.\n8. Ch. xi. \u00a7 3.\n9. F. Pedro Iba\u00f1ez.\n10. The house of Do\u00f1a Luisa, in Toledo.\n11.

When the workmen were busy with the building, a nephew of the\nSaint, the child of her sister and Don Juan de Ovalle, was struck\nby some falling stones and killed.  The workmen took the child to\nhis mother: and the Saint, then in the house of Do\u00f1a Guiomar de\nUlloa, was sent for.  Do\u00f1a Guiomar took the dead boy into her\narms, gave him to the Saint, saying that it was a grievous blow\nto the father and mother, and that she must obtain his life from\nGod.  The Saint took the body, and, laying it in her lap, ordered\nthose around her to cease their lamentations, of whom her sister\nwas naturally the loudest, and be silent.  Then, covering her\nface and her body with her veil, she prayed to God, and God gave\nthe child his life again.  The little boy soon after ran up to\nhis aunt and thanked her for what she had done. In after years\nthe child used to say to the Saint that, as she had deprived him\nof the bliss of heaven by bringing him back to life, she was\nbound to see that he did not suffer loss.  Don Gonzalo died three\nyears after St. Teresa, when he was twenty-eight years of age\n(Reforma, i. c. 42, \u00a7\u00a02).\n17. Psalm xciii. 20: \"Qui fingis laborem in pr\u00e6cepto.\"\nChapter XXXVI.\nThe Foundation of the Monastery of St. Joseph.\nPersecution and Temptations.  Great Interior Trial of the Saint,\nand Her Deliverance.\n1. Having now left that city, [1] I travelled in great joy,\nresolved to suffer most willingly whatever our Lord might be\npleased to lay upon me.  On the night of my arrival here, [2]\ncame also from Rome the commission and the Brief for the erection\nof the monastery. [3]  I was astonished myself, and so were those\nwho knew how our Lord hastened my coming, when they saw how\nnecessary it was, and in what a moment our Lord had brought me\nback. [4]  I found here the Bishop and the holy friar, [5] Peter\nof Alcantara, and that nobleman, [6] the great servant of God, in\nwhose house the holy man was staying; for he was a man who was in\nthe habit of receiving the servants of God in his house.\nThese two prevailed on the Bishop to accept the monastery, which\nwas no small thing, because it was founded in poverty; but he was\nso great a lover of those whom he saw determined to serve our\nLord, that he was immediately drawn to give them His protection.\nIt was the approbation of the holy old man, [7] and the great\ntrouble he took to make now this one, now that one, help us, that\ndid the whole work.  If I had not come at the moment, as I have\njust said, I do not see how it could have been done; for the holy\nman was here but a short time,--I think not quite eight\ndays,--during which he was also ill; and almost immediately\nafterwards our Lord took him to Himself. [8]  It seems as if His\nMajesty reserved him till this affair was ended, because now for\nsome time--I think for more than two years--he had been very ill.\n2. Everything was done in the utmost secrecy; and if it had not\nbeen so, I do not see how anything could have been done at all;\nfor the people of the city were against us, as it appeared\nafterwards.  Our Lord ordained that one of my brothers-in-law [9]\nshould be ill, and his wife away, and himself in such straits\nthat my superiors gave me leave to remain with him.\nNothing, therefore, was found out, though some persons had their\nsuspicions;--still, they did not believe.  It was very wonderful,\nfor his illness lasted only no longer than was necessary for our\naffair; and when it was necessary he should recover his health,\nthat I might be disengaged, and he leave the house empty, our\nLord restored him; and he was astonished at it himself. [10]\n3. I had much trouble in persuading this person and that to allow\nthe foundation; I had to nurse the sick man, and obtain from the\nworkmen the hasty preparation of the house, so that it might have\nthe form of a monastery; but much remained still to be done.\nMy friend was not here, [11] for we thought it best she should be\naway, in order the better to hide our purpose.  I saw that\neverything depended on haste, for many, reasons, one of which was\nthat I was afraid I might be ordered back to my monastery at any\nmoment.  I was troubled by so many things, that I suspected my\ncross had been sent me, though it seemed but a light one in\ncomparison with that which I understood our Lord meant me\nto carry.\n4. When everything was settled, our Lord was pleased that some of\nus should take the habit on St. Bartholomew's Day.  The most Holy\nSacrament began to dwell in the house at the same time. [12]\nWith full sanction and authority, then, our monastery of our most\nglorious father St. Joseph was founded in the year 1562. [13]\nI was there myself to give the habit, with two nuns [14] of the\nhouse to which we belonged, who happened then to be absent from\nit.  As the house which thus became a monastery was that of my\nbrother-in-law--I said before [15] that he had bought it, for the\npurpose of concealing our plan--I was there myself with the\npermission of my superiors; and I did nothing without the advice\nof learned men, in order that I might not break, in a single\npoint, my vow of obedience.  As these persons considered what I\nwas doing to be most advantageous for the whole Order, on many\naccounts, they told me--though I was acting secretly, and taking\ncare my superiors should know nothing--that I might go on.\nIf they had told me that there was the slightest imperfection in\nthe whole matter, I would have given up the founding of a\nthousand monasteries,--how much more, then, this one!  I am\ncertain of this; for though I longed to withdraw from everything\nmore and more, and to follow my rule and vocation in the greatest\nperfection and seclusion, yet I wished to do so only\nconditionally: for if I should have learnt that it would be for\nthe greater honour of our Lord to abandon it, I would have done\nso, as I did before on one occasion, [16] in all peace\nand contentment.\n5. I felt as if I were in bliss, when I saw the most Holy\nSacrament reserved, with four poor orphans, [17]--for they were\nreceived without a dowry,--and great servants of God, established\nin the house.  It was our aim from the beginning to receive only\nthose who, by their example, might be the foundation on which we\ncould build up what we had in view--great perfection and\nprayer--and effect a work which I believed to be for the service\nof our Lord, and to the honour of the habit of His glorious\nMother. This was my anxiety.  It was also a great consolation to\nme that I had done that which our Lord had so often commanded me\nto do, and that there was one church more in this city dedicated\nto my glorious father St. Joseph.  Not that I thought I had done\nanything myself, for I have never thought so, and do not think so\neven now; I always looked upon it as the work of our Lord.\nMy part in it was so full of imperfections, that I look upon\nmyself rather as a person in fault than as one to whom any thanks\nare due.  But it was a great joy to me when I saw His Majesty\nmake use of me, who am so worthless, as His instrument in so\ngrand a work.  I was therefore in great joy,--so much so, that I\nwas, as it were, beside myself, lost in prayer.\n6. When all was done--it might have been about three or four\nhours afterwards--Satan returned to the spiritual fight against\nme, as I shall now relate.  He suggested to me that perhaps I had\nbeen wrong in what I had done; perhaps I had failed in my\nobedience, in having brought it about without the commandment of\nthe Provincial.  I did certainly think that the Provincial would\nbe displeased because I had placed the monastery under the\njurisdiction of the Bishop [18] without telling him of it\nbeforehand; though, as he would not acknowledge the monastery\nhimself, and as I had not changed mine, it seemed to me that\nperhaps he would not care much about the matter.  Satan also\nsuggested whether the nuns would be contented to live in so\nstrict a house, whether they could always find food, whether I\nhad not done a silly thing, and what had I to do with it, when I\nwas already in a monastery?  All our Lord had said to me, all the\nopinions I had heard, and all the prayers which had been almost\nuninterrupted for more than two years, were completely blotted\nout of my memory, just as if they had never been.  The only thing\nI remembered was my own opinion; and every virtue, with faith\nitself, was then suspended within me, so that I was without\nstrength to practise any one of them, or to defend myself against\nso many blows.\n7. The devil also would have me ask myself how I could think of\nshutting myself up in so strict a house, when I was subject to so\nmany infirmities; how could I bear so penitential a life, and\nleave a house large and pleasant, where I had been always so\nhappy, and where I had so many friends?--perhaps I might not like\nthose of the new monastery; I had taken on myself a heavy\nobligation, and might possibly end in despair.  He also suggested\nthat perhaps it was he himself who had contrived it, in order to\nrob me of my peace and rest, so that, being unable to pray, I\nmight be disquieted, and so lose my soul.  Thoughts of this kind\nhe put before me; and they were so many, that I could think of\nnothing else; and with them came such distress, obscurity, and\ndarkness of soul as I can never describe.  When I found myself in\nthis state, I went and placed myself before the most Holy\nSacrament, though I could not pray to Him; so great was my\nanguish, that I was like one in the agony of death.  I could not\nmake the matter known to any one, because no confessor had as yet\nbeen appointed.\n8. O my God, how wretched is this life!  No joy is lasting;\neverything is liable to change.  Only a moment ago, I do not\nthink I would have exchanged my joy with any man upon earth; and\nthe very grounds of that joy so tormented me now, that I knew not\nwhat to do with myself.  Oh, if we did but consider carefully the\nevents of our life, every one of us would learn from experience\nhow little we ought to make either of its pleasures or of its\npains!  Certainly this was, I believe, one of the most\ndistressing moments I ever passed in all my life; my spirit\nseemed to forecast the great sufferings in store for me, though\nthey never were so heavy as this was, if it had continued.\nBut our Lord would not let His poor servant suffer, for in all my\ntroubles He never failed to succour me; so it was now.  He gave\nme a little light, so that I might see it was the work of the\ndevil, and might understand the truth,--namely, that it was\nnothing else but an attempt on his part to frighten me with his\nlies.  So I began to call to mind my great resolutions to serve\nour Lord, and my desire to suffer for His sake; and I thought\nthat if I carried them out, I must not seek to be at rest; that\nif I had my trials, they would be meritorious; and that if I had\ntroubles, and endured them in order to please God, it would serve\nme for purgatory.  What was I, then, afraid of?  If I longed for\ntribulations, I had them now; and my gain lay in the greatest\nopposition.  Why, then, did I fail in courage to serve One to\nwhom I owed so much?\n9. After making these and other reflections, and doing great\nviolence to myself, I promised before the most Holy Sacrament to\ndo all in my power to obtain permission to enter this house, and,\nif I could do it with a good conscience, to make a vow of\nenclosure.  When I had done this, the devil fled in a moment, and\nleft me calm and peaceful, and I have continued so ever since;\nand the enclosure, penances, and other rules of this house are to\nme, in their observance, so singularly sweet and light, the joy I\nhave is so exceedingly great, that I am now and then thinking\nwhat on earth I could have chosen which should be more\ndelightful.  I know not whether this may not be the cause of my\nbeing in better health than I was ever before, or whether it be\nthat our Lord, because it is needful and reasonable that I should\ndo as all the others do, gives me this comfort of keeping the\nwhole rule, though with some difficulty.  However, all who know\nmy infirmities, are astonished at my strength.  Blessed be He who\ngiveth it all, and in whose strength I am strong!\n10. Such a contest left me greatly fatigued, and laughing at\nSatan; for I saw clearly it was he.  As I have never known what\nit is to be discontented because I am a nun--no, not for an\ninstant--during more than twenty-eight years of religion, I\nbelieve that our Lord suffered me to be thus tempted, that I\nmight understand how great a mercy He had shown me herein, and\nfrom what torment He had delivered me, and that if I saw any one\nin like trouble I might not be alarmed at it, but have pity on\nher, and be able to console her.\n11. Then, when this was over, I wished to rest myself a little\nafter our dinner; for during the whole of that night I had\nscarcely rested at all, and for some nights previously I had had\nmuch trouble and anxiety, while every day was full of toil; for\nthe news of what we had done had reached my monastery, and was\nspread through the city.  There arose a great outcry, for the\nreasons I mentioned before, [19] and there was some apparent\nground for it.  The prioress [20] sent for me to come to her\nimmediately.  When I received the order, I went at once, leaving\nthe nuns in great distress.  I saw clearly enough that there were\ntroubles before me; but as the work was really done, I did not\ncare much for that.  I prayed and implored our Lord to help me,\nand my father St. Joseph to bring me back to his house.\nI offered up to him all I was to suffer, rejoicing greatly that I\nhad the opportunity of suffering for his honour and of doing him\nservice.  I went persuaded that I should be put in prison at once\nbut this would have been a great comfort, because I should have\nnobody to speak to, and might have some rest and solitude, of\nwhich I was in great need; for so much intercourse with people\nhad worn me out.\n12. When I came and told the prioress what I had done, she was\nsoftened a little.  They all sent for the Provincial, and the\nmatter was reserved for him.  When he came, I was summoned to\njudgment, rejoicing greatly at seeing that I had something to\nsuffer for our Lord.  I did not think I had offended against His\nMajesty, or against my Order, in anything I had done; on the\ncontrary, I was striving with all my might to exalt my Order, for\nwhich I would willingly have died,--for my whole desire was that\nits rule might be observed in all perfection.  I thought of\nChrist receiving sentence, and I saw how this of mine would be\nless than nothing.  I confessed my fault, as if I had been very\nmuch to blame; and so I seemed to every one who did not know all\nthe reasons.  After the Provincial had rebuked me sharply--though\nnot with the severity which my fault deserved, nor according to\nthe representations made to him--I would not defend myself, for I\nwas determined to bear it all; on the contrary, I prayed him to\nforgive and punish, and be no longer angry with me.\n13. I saw well enough that they condemned me on some charges of\nwhich I was innocent, for they said I had founded the monastery\nthat I might be thought much of, and to make myself a name, and\nfor other reasons of that kind.  But on other points I understood\nclearly that they were speaking the truth, as when they said that\nI was more wicked than the other nuns.  They asked, how could I,\nwho had not kept the rule in that house, think of keeping it in\nanother of stricter observance?  They said I was giving scandal\nin the city, and setting up novelties.  All this neither troubled\nnor distressed me in the least, though I did seem to feel it,\nlest I should appear to make light of what they were saying.\n14. At last the Provincial commanded me to explain my conduct\nbefore the nuns, and I had to do it.  As I was perfectly calm,\nand our Lord helped me, I explained everything in such a way that\nneither the Provincial nor those who were present found any\nreason to condemn me.  Afterwards I spoke more plainly to the\nProvincial alone; he was very much satisfied, and promised, if\nthe new monastery prospered, and the city became quiet, to give\nme leave to live in it.  Now the outcry in the city was very\ngreat, as I am going to tell.  Two or three days after this, the\ngovernor, certain members of the council of the city and of the\nChapter, came together, and resolved that the new monastery\nshould not be allowed to exist, that it was a visible wrong to\nthe state, that the most Holy Sacrament should be removed, and\nthat they would not suffer us to go on with our work.\n15. They assembled all the Orders--that is, two learned men from\neach--to give their opinion.  Some were silent, others condemned;\nin the end, they resolved that the monastery should be broken up.\nOnly one [21]--he was of the Order of St. Dominic, and objected,\nnot to the monastery itself, but to the foundation of it in\npoverty--said that there was no reason why it should be thus\ndissolved, that the matter ought to be well considered, that\nthere was time enough, that it was the affair of the bishop, with\nother things of that kind.  This was of great service to us, for\nthey were angry enough to proceed to its destruction at once, and\nit was fortunate they did not.  In short, the monastery must\nexist; our Lord was pleased to have it, and all of them could do\nnothing against His will.  They gave their reasons, and showed\ntheir zeal for good, and thus, without offending God, made me\nsuffer together with all those who were in favour of the\nmonastery; there were not many, but they suffered much\npersecution.  The inhabitants were so excited, that they talked\nof nothing else; every one condemned me, and hurried to the\nProvincial and to my monastery.\n16. I was no more distressed by what they said of me than if they\nhad said nothing; but I was afraid the monastery would be\ndestroyed: that was painful; so also was it to see those persons\nwho helped me lose their credit and suffer so much annoyance.\nBut as to what was said of myself I was rather glad, and if I had\nhad any faith I should not have been troubled at all.  But a\nslight failing in one virtue is enough to put all the others to\nsleep. I was therefore extremely distressed during the two days\non which those assemblies of which I have spoken were held.\nIn the extremity of my trouble, our Lord said to me: \"Knowest\nthou not that I am the Almighty? what art thou afraid of?\"\nHe made me feel assured that the monastery would not be broken\nup, and I was exceedingly comforted.  The informations taken were\nsent up to the king's council, and an order came back for a\nreport on the whole matter.\n17. Here was the beginning of a grand lawsuit: the city sent\ndelegates to the court, and some must be sent also to defend the\nmonastery: but I had no money, nor did I know what to do.\nOur Lord provided for us for the Father Provincial never ordered\nme not to meddle in the matter.  He is so great a lover of all\nthat is good, that, though he did not help us, he would not be\nagainst our work.  Neither did he authorise me to enter the house\ntill he saw how it would end.  Those servants of God who were in\nit were left alone, and did more by their prayers than I did with\nall my negotiations, though the affair needed the utmost\nattention.  Now and then everything seemed to fail; particularly\none day, before the Provincial came, when the prioress ordered me\nto meddle no more with it, and to give it up altogether.\nI betook myself to God, and said, \"O Lord, this house is not\nmine; it was founded for Thee; and now that there is no one to\ntake up the cause, do Thou protect it.\"  I now felt myself in\npeace, and as free from anxiety as if the whole world were on my\nside in the matter; and at once I looked upon it as safe. [22]\n18. A very great servant of God, and a lover of all perfection, a\npriest [23] who had helped me always, went to the court on this\nbusiness, and took great pains.  That holy nobleman [24] of whom\nI have often spoken laboured much on our behalf, and helped us in\nevery way.  He had much trouble and persecution to endure, and I\nalways found a father in him, and do so still.  All those who\nhelped us, our Lord filled with such fervour as made them\nconsider our affair as their own, as if their own life and\nreputation were at stake; and yet it was nothing to them, except\nin so far as it regarded the service of our Lord.  His Majesty\nvisibly helped the priest I have spoken of before, [25] who was\nalso one of those who gave us great help when the Bishop sent him\nas his representative to one of the great meetings.  There he\nstood alone against all; at last he pacified them by means of\ncertain propositions, which obtained us a little respite.\nBut that was not enough; for they were ready to spend their\nlives, if they could but destroy the monastery.  This servant of\nGod was he who gave the habit and reserved the most Holy\nSacrament, and he was the object of much persecution.\nThis attack lasted about six months: to relate in detail the\nheavy trials we passed through would be too tedious.\n19. I wondered at what Satan did against a few poor women, and\nalso how all people thought that merely twelve women, with a\nprioress, could be so hurtful to the city,--for they were not to\nbe more,--I say this to those who opposed us,--and living such\naustere lives; for if any harm or error came of it, it would all\nfall upon them.  Harm to the city there could not be in any way;\nand yet the people thought there was so much in it, that they\nopposed us with a good conscience.  At last they resolved they\nwould tolerate us if we were endowed, and in consideration of\nthat would suffer us to remain.  I was so distressed at the\ntrouble of all those who were on our side--more than at my\nown--that I thought it would not be amiss, till the people were\npacified, to accept an endowment, but afterwards to resign it.\nAt other times, too, wicked and imperfect as I am, I thought that\nperhaps our Lord wished it to be so, seeing that, without\naccepting it, we could not succeed; and so I consented to\nthe compromise.\n20. The night before the settlement was to be made, I was in\nprayer,--the discussion of the terms of it had already\nbegun,--when our Lord said to me that I must do nothing of the\nkind; for if we began with an endowment, they would never allow\nus to resign it.  He said some other things also.  The same\nnight, the holy friar, Peter of Alcantara, appeared to me.\nHe was then dead. [26]  But he had written to me before his\ndeath--for he knew the great opposition and persecution we had to\nbear--that he was glad the foundation was so much spoken against;\nit was a sign that our Lord would be exceedingly honoured in the\nmonastery, seeing that Satan was so earnest against it; and that\nI was by no means to consent to an endowment.  He urged this upon\nme twice or thrice in that letter, and said that if I persisted\nin this everything would succeed according to my wish.\n21. At this time I had already seen him twice since his death,\nand the great glory he was in, and so I was not afraid,--on the\ncontrary, I was very glad; for he always appeared as a glorified\nbody in great happiness, and the vision made me very happy too.\nI remember that he told me, the first time I saw him, among other\nthings, when speaking of the greatness of his joy, that the\npenance he had done was a blessed thing for him, in that it had\nobtained so great a reward.  But, as I think I have spoken of\nthis before, [27] I will now say no more than that he showed\nhimself severe on this occasion: he merely said that I was on no\naccount to accept an endowment, and asked why it was I did not\ntake his advice.  He then disappeared. I remained in\nastonishment, and the next day told the nobleman--for I went to\nhim in all my trouble, as to one who did more than others for us\nin the matter,--what had taken place, and charged him not to\nconsent to the endowment, but to let the lawsuit go on.  He was\nmore firm on this point than I was, and was therefore greatly\npleased; he told me afterwards how much he disliked\nthe compromise.\n22. After this, another personage--a great servant of God, and\nwith good intentions--came forward, who, now that the matter was\nin good train, advised us to put it in the hands of learned men.\nThis brought on trouble enough; for some of those who helped me\nagreed to do so; and this plot of Satan was one of the most\ndifficult of all to unravel.  Our Lord was my helper throughout.\nWriting thus briefly, it is impossible for me to explain what\ntook place during the two years that passed between the beginning\nand the completion of the monastery: the last six months and the\nfirst six months were the most painful.\n23. When at last the city was somewhat calm, the licentiate\nfather, the Dominican friar [28] who helped us, exerted himself\nmost skilfully on our behalf.  Though not here at the time, our\nLord brought him here at a most convenient moment for our\nservice, and it seems that His Majesty brought him for that\npurpose only.  He told me afterwards that he had no reasons for\ncoming, and that he heard of our affair as if by chance.\nHe remained here as long as we wanted him, and on going away he\nprevailed, by some means, on the Father Provincial to permit me\nto enter this house, and to take with me some of the\nnuns [29]--such a permission seemed impossible in so short a time\nfor the performance of the Divine Office--and the training of\nthose who were in this house: the day of our coming was a most\njoyful day for me. [30]\n24. While praying in the church, before I went into the house,\nand being as it were in a trance, I saw Christ; who, as it seemed\nto me, received me with great affection, placed a crown on my\nhead, and thanked me for what I had done for His Mother.\nOn another occasion, when all of us remained in the choir in\nprayer after Compline, I saw our Lady in exceeding glory, in a\nwhite mantle, with which she seemed to cover us all.\nI understood by that the high degree of glory to which our Lord\nwould raise the religious of this house.\n25. When we had begun to sing the Office, the people began to\nhave a great devotion to the monastery; more nuns were received,\nand our Lord began to stir up those who had been our greatest\npersecutors to become great benefactors, and give alms to us.\nIn this way they came to approve of what they had condemned; and\nso, by degrees, they withdrew from the lawsuit, and would say\nthat they now felt it to be a work of God, since His Majesty had\nbeen pleased to carry it on in the face of so much opposition.\nAnd now there is not one who thinks that it would have been right\nnot to have founded the monastery: so they make a point of\nfurnishing us with alms; for without any asking on our part,\nwithout begging of any one, our Lord moves them to, succour us;\nand so we always have what is necessary for us, and I trust in\nour Lord it will always be so. [31]  As the sisters are few in\nnumber, if they do their duty as our Lord at present by His grace\nenables them to do, I am confident that they will always have it,\nand that they need not be a burden nor troublesome to anybody;\nfor our Lord will care for them, as He has hitherto done.\n26. It is the greatest consolation to me to find myself among\nthose who are so detached.  Their occupation is to learn how they\nmay advance in the service of God.  Solitude is their delight;\nand the thought of being visited by any one, even of their\nnearest kindred, is a trial, unless it helps them to kindle more\nand more their love of the Bridegroom.  Accordingly, none come to\nthis house who do not aim at this; otherwise they neither give\nnor receive any pleasure from their visits.  Their conversation\nis of God only; and so he whose conversation is different does\nnot understand them, and they do not understand him.\n27. We keep the rule of our Lady of Carmel, not the rule of the\nMitigation, but as it was settled by Fr. Hugo, Cardinal of Santa\nSabina, and given in the year 1248, in the fifth year of the\npontificate of Innocent IV., Pope.  All the trouble we had to go\nthrough, as it seems to me, will have been endured to\ngood purpose.\n28. And now, though the rule be somewhat severe,--for we never\neat flesh except in cases of necessity, fast eight months in the\nyear, and practise some other austerities besides, according to\nthe primitive rule, [32]--yet the sisters think it light on many\npoints, and so they have other observances, which we have thought\nnecessary for the more perfect keeping of it.  And I trust in our\nLord that what we have begun will prosper more and more,\naccording to the promise of His Majesty.\n29. The other house, which the holy woman of whom I spoke\nbefore [33] laboured to establish, has been also blessed of our\nLord, and is founded in Alcala: it did not escape serious\nopposition, nor fail to endure many trials.  I know that all\nduties of religion are observed in it, according to our primitive\nrule.  Our Lord grant that all may be to the praise and glory of\nHimself and of the glorious Virgin Mary, whose habit we\nwear.  Amen.\n30. I think you must be wearied, my father, by the tedious\nhistory of this monastery; and yet it is most concise, if you\ncompare it with our labours, and the wonders which our Lord has\nwrought here.  There are many who can bear witness to this on\noath.  I therefore beg of your reverence, for the love of God,\nshould you think fit to destroy the rest of this my writing, to\npreserve that part of it which relates to this monastery, and\ngive it, when I am dead, to the sisters who may then be living in\nit.  It will encourage them greatly, who shall come here both to\nserve God and to labour, that what has been thus begun may not\nfall to decay, but ever grow and thrive, when they see how much\nour Lord has done through one so mean and vile as I.  As our Lord\nhas been so particularly gracious to us in the foundation of this\nhouse it seems to me that she will do very wrong, and that she\nwill be heavily chastised of God, who shall be the first to relax\nthe perfect observance of the rule, which our Lord has here begun\nand countenanced, so that it may be kept with so much sweetness:\nit is most evident that the observance of it is easy, and that it\ncan be kept with ease, by the arrangement made for those who long\nto be alone with their Bridegroom Christ, in order to live for\never in Him.\n31. This is to be the perpetual aim of those who are here, to be\nalone with Him alone.  They are not to be more in number than\nthirteen: I know this number to be the best, for I have had many\nopinions about it; and I have seen in my own experience, that to\npreserve our spirit, living on alms, without asking of anyone, a\nlarger number would be inexpedient.  May they always believe one\nwho with much labour, and by the prayers of many people,\naccomplished that which must be for the best!  That this is most\nexpedient for us will be seen from the joy and cheerfulness, and\nthe few troubles, we have all had in the years we have lived in\nthis house, as well as from the better health than usual of us\nall.  If any one thinks the rule hard, let her lay the fault on\nher want of the true spirit, and not on the rule of the house,\nseeing that delicate persons, and those not saints,--because they\nhave the true spirit,--can bear it all with so much sweetness.\nLet others go to another monastery, where they may save their\nsouls in the way of their own spirit.\n1.

At this time Ba\u00f1es\ndid not know, and had never seen, the Saint; he undertook her\ndefence simply because he saw that her intentions were good, and\nthe means she made use of for founding the monastery lawful,\nseeing that she had received the commandment to do so from the\nPope.

Maria of Jesus had founded her house in\nAlcala de Henares; but the austerities practised in it, and the\nabsence of the religious mitigations which long experience had\nintroduced, were too much for the fervent nuns there assembled.\nMaria of Jesus begged Do\u00f1a Leonor de Mascare\u00f1as to persuade\nSt. Teresa to come to Alcala.

The Inestimable\nGreatness of One Degree of Glory.\n1. It is painful to me to recount more of the graces which our\nLord gave me than these already spoken of; and they are so many,\nthat nobody can believe they were ever given to one so wicked:\nbut in obedience to our Lord, who has commanded me to do it, [1]\nand you, my fathers, I will speak of some of them to His glory.\nMay it please His Majesty it may be to the profit of some soul!\nFor if our Lord has been thus gracious to so--miserable a thing\nas myself, what will He be to those who shall serve Him truly?\nLet all people resolve to please His Majesty, seeing that He\ngives such pledges as these even in this life. [2]\n2. In the first place, it must be understood that, in those\ngraces which God bestows on the soul, there are diverse degrees\nof joy: for in some visions the joy and sweetness and comfort of\nthem so far exceed those of others, that I am amazed at the\ndifferent degrees of fruition even in this life; for it happens\nthat the joy and consolation which God gives in a vision or a\ntrance are so different, that it seems impossible for the soul to\nbe able to desire anything more in this world: and, so, in fact,\nthe soul does not desire, nor would it ask for, a greater joy.\nStill, since our Lord has made me understand how great a\ndifference there is in heaven itself between the fruition of one\nand that of another, I see clearly enough that here also, when\nour Lord wills, He gives not by measure; [3] and so I wish that I\nmyself observed no measure in serving His Majesty, and in using\nmy whole life and strength and health therein; and I would not\nhave any fault of mine rob me of the slightest degree\nof fruition.\n3. And so I say that if I were asked which I preferred, to endure\nall the trials of the world until the end of it, and then receive\none slight degree of glory additional, or without any suffering\nof any kind to enter into glory of a slightly lower degree, I\nwould accept--oh, how willingly!--all those trials for one slight\ndegree of fruition in the contemplation of the greatness of God;\nfor I know that he who understands Him best, loves Him and\npraises Him best.  I do not mean that I should not be satisfied,\nand consider myself most blessed, to be in heaven, even if I\nshould be in the lowest place; for as I am one who had that place\nin hell, it would be a great mercy of our Lord to admit me at\nall; and may it please His Majesty to bring me thither, and take\naway His eyes from beholding my grievous sins. What I mean is\nthis,--if it were in my power, even if it cost me everything, and\nour Lord gave me the grace to endure much affliction, I would not\nthrough any fault of mine lose one degree of glory.  Ah, wretched\nthat I am, who by so many faults had forfeited all!\n4. It is also to be observed that, in every vision or revelation\nwhich our Lord in His mercy sent me, a great gain accrued to my\nsoul, and that in some of the visions this gain was very great.\nThe vision of Christ left behind an impression of His exceeding\nbeauty, and it remains with me to this day.  One vision alone of\nHim is enough to effect this; what, then, must all those visions\nhave done, which our Lord in His mercy sent me? One exceedingly\ngreat blessing has resulted therefrom, and it is this,--I had one\nvery grievous fault, which was the source of much evil; namely,\nwhenever I found anybody well disposed towards myself, and I\nliked him, I used to have such an affection for him as compelled\nme always to remember and think of him, though I had no intention\nof offending God: however, I was pleased to see him, to think of\nhim and of his good qualities.  All this was so hurtful, that it\nbrought my soul to the very verge of destruction.\n5. But ever since I saw the great beauty [4] of our Lord, I never\nsaw any one who in comparison with Him seemed even endurable, or\nthat could occupy my thoughts.  For if I but turn mine eyes\ninwardly for a moment to the contemplation of the image which I\nhave within me, I find myself so free, that from that instant\neverything I see is loathsome in comparison with the excellences\nand graces of which I had a vision in our Lord.  Neither is there\nany sweetness, nor any kind of pleasure, which I can make any\naccount of, compared with that which comes from hearing but one\nword from His divine mouth.  What, then, must it be when I hear\nso many?  I look upon it as impossible--unless our Lord, for my\nsins, should permit the loss of this remembrance--that I should\nhave the power to occupy myself with anything in such a way as\nthat I should not instantly recover my liberty by thinking of\nour Lord.\n6. This has happened to me with some of my confessors, for I\nalways have a great affection for those who have the direction of\nmy soul.  As I really saw in them only the representatives of\nGod, I thought my will was always there where it is most\noccupied; and as I felt very safe in the matter, I always showed\nmyself glad to see them. [5]  They, on the other hand, servants\nof God, and fearing Him, were afraid that I was attaching and\nbinding myself too much to them, though in a holy way, and\ntreated me with rudeness.  This took place after I had become so\nready to obey them; for before that time I had no affection\nwhatever for them.  I used to laugh to myself, when I saw how\nmuch they were deceived.  Though I was not always putting before\nthem how little I was attached to anybody, as clearly as I was\nconvinced of it myself, yet I did assure them of it; and they, in\ntheir further relations with me, acknowledged how much I owed to\nour Lord in the matter.  These suspicions of me always arose in\nthe beginning.\n7. My love of, and trust in, our Lord, after I had seen Him in a\nvision, began to grow, for my converse with Him was so continual.\nI saw that, though He was God, He was man also; that He is not\nsurprised at the frailties of men, that He understands our\nmiserable nature, liable to fall continually, because of the\nfirst sin, for the reparation of which He had come.  I could\nspeak to Him as to a friend, though He is my Lord, because I do\nnot consider Him as one of our earthly Lords, who affect a power\nthey do not possess, who give audience at fixed hours, and to\nwhom only certain persons may speak.  If a poor man have any\nbusiness with these, it will cost him many goings and comings,\nand currying favour with others, together with much pain and\nlabour before he can speak to them.  Ah, if such a one has\nbusiness with a king!  Poor people, not of gentle blood, cannot\napproach him, for they must apply to those who are his friends,\nand certainly these are not persons who tread the world under\ntheir feet; for they who do this speak the truth, fear nothing,\nand ought to fear nothing; they are not courtiers, because it is\nnot the custom of a court, where they must be silent about those\nthings they dislike, must not even dare to think about them, lest\nthey should fall into disgrace.\n8. O King of glory, and Lord of all kings! oh, how Thy kingly\ndignity is not hedged about by trifles of this kind!  Thy kingdom\nis for ever.  We do not require chamberlains to introduce us into\nThy presence.  The very vision of Thy person shows us at once\nthat Thou alone art to be called Lord.  Thy Majesty is so\nmanifest that there is no need of a retinue or guard to make us\nconfess that Thou art King.  An earthly king without attendants\nwould be hardly acknowledged; and though he might wish ever so\nmuch to be recognised, people will not own him when he appears as\nothers; it is necessary that his dignity should be visible, if\npeople are to believe in it.  This is reason enough why kings\nshould affect so much state; for if they had none, no one would\nrespect them; this their semblance of power is not in themselves,\nand their authority must come to them from others.\n9. O my Lord!  O my King! who can describe Thy Majesty?  It is\nimpossible not to see that Thou art Thyself the great Ruler of\nall, that the beholding of Thy Majesty fills men with awe.  But I\nam filled with greater awe, O my Lord, when I consider Thy\nhumility, and the love Thou hast for such as I am.  We can\nconverse and speak with Thee about everything whenever we will;\nand when we lose our first fear and awe at the vision of Thy\nMajesty, we have a greater dread of offending Thee,--not arising\nout of the fear of punishment, O my Lord, for that is as nothing\nin comparison with the loss of Thee!\n10. Thus far of the blessings of this vision, without speaking of\nothers, which abide in the soul when it is past.  If it be from\nGod, the fruits thereof show it, when the soul receives light;\nfor, as I have often said, [6] the will of our Lord is that the\nsoul should be in darkness, and not see this light.  It is,\ntherefore, nothing to be wondered at that I, knowing myself to be\nso wicked as I am, should be afraid.\n11. It is only just now it happened to me to be for eight days in\na state wherein it seemed that I did not, and could not, confess\nmy obligations to God, or remember His mercies; but my soul was\nso stupefied, and occupied with I know not what nor how: not that\nI had any bad thoughts; only I was so incapable of good thoughts,\nthat I was laughing at myself, and even rejoicing to see how mean\na soul can be if God is not always working in it. [7]  The soul\nsees clearly that God is not away from it in this state, and that\nit is not in those  great tribulations which I have spoken of as\nbeing occasionally mine.  Though it heaps up fuel, and does the\nlittle it can do of itself, it cannot make the fire of the love\nof God burn: it is a great mercy that even the smoke is visible,\nshowing that it is not altogether quenched.  Our Lord will return\nand kindle it; and until then the soul--though it may lose its\nbreath in blowing and arranging the fuel--seems to be doing\nnothing but putting it out more and more.\n12. I believe that now the best course is to be absolutely\nresigned, confessing that we can do nothing, and so apply\nourselves--as I said before [8]--to something else which is\nmeritorious.  Our Lord, it may be, takes away from the soul the\npower of praying, that it may betake itself to something else,\nand learn by experience how little it can do in its own strength.\n13. It is true I have this day been rejoicing in our Lord, and\nhave dared to complain of His Majesty.  I said unto Him: How is\nit, O my God, that it is not enough for Thee to detain me in this\nwretched life, and that I should have to bear with it for the\nlove of Thee, and be willing to live where everything hinders the\nfruition of Thee; where, besides, I must eat and sleep, transact\nbusiness, and converse with every one, and all for Thy love? how\nis it, then,--for Thou well knowest, O my Lord, all this to be\nthe greatest torment unto me,--that, in the rare moments when I\nam with Thee, Thou hidest Thyself from me?  How is this\nconsistent with Thy compassion?  How can that love Thou hast for\nme endure this?  I believe, O Lord, if it were possible for me to\nhide myself from Thee, as Thou hidest Thyself from me--I think\nand believe so--such is Thy love, that Thou wouldest not endure\nit at my hands.  But Thou art with me, and seest me always.  O my\nLord, I beseech Thee look to this; it must not be; a wrong is\ndone to one who loves Thee so much.\n14. I happened to utter these words, and others of the same kind,\nwhen I should have been thinking rather how my place in hell was\npleasant in comparison with the place I deserved.  But now and\nthen my love makes me foolish, so that I lose my senses; only it\nis with all the sense I have that I make these complaints, and\nour Lord bears it all.  Blessed be so good a King!\n15. Can we be thus bold with the kings of this world?  And yet I\nam not surprised that we dare not thus speak to a king, for it is\nonly reasonable that men should be afraid of him, or even to the\ngreat lords who are his representatives.  The world is now come\nto such a state, that men's lives ought to be longer than they\nare if we are to learn all the new customs and ceremonies of good\nbreeding, and yet spend any time in the service of God.  I bless\nmyself at the sight of what is going on.  The fact is, I did not\nknow how I was to live when I came into this house.\nAny negligence in being much more ceremonious with people than\nthey deserve is not taken as a jest; on the contrary, they look\nupon it as an insult deliberately offered; so that it becomes\nnecessary for you to satisfy them of your good intentions, if\nthere happens, as I have said, to have been any negligence; and\neven then, God grant they may believe you.\n16. I repeat it,--I certainly did not know how to live; for my\npoor soul was worn out.  It is told to employ all its thoughts\nalways on God, and that it is necessary to do so if it would\navoid many dangers.  On the other hand, it finds it will not do\nto fail in any one point of the world's law, under the penalty of\naffronting those who look upon these things as touching their\nhonour.  I was worn out in unceasingly giving satisfaction to\npeople; for, though I tried my utmost, I could not help failing\nin many ways in matters which, as I have said, are not slightly\nthought of in the world.\n17. Is it true that in religious houses no explanations are\nnecessary, for it is only reasonable we should be excused these\nobservances?  Well, that is not so; for there are people who say\nthat monasteries ought to be courts in politeness and\ninstruction.  I certainly cannot understand it.  I thought that\nperhaps some saint may have said that they ought to be courts to\nteach those who wish to be the courtiers of heaven, and that\nthese people misunderstood their meaning; for if a man be careful\nto please God continually, and to hate the world, as he ought to\ndo, I do not see how he can be equally careful to please those\nwho live in the world in these matters which are continually\nchanging.  If they could be learnt once for all, it might be\nborne with: but as to the way of addressing letters, there ought\nto be a professor's chair founded, from which lectures should be\ngiven, so to speak, teaching us how to do it; for the paper\nshould on one occasion be left blank in one corner, and on\nanother in another corner; and a man must be addressed as the\nillustrious who was not hitherto addressed as the magnificent.\n18. I know not where this will stop: I am not yet fifty, and yet\nI have seen so many changes during my life, that I do not know\nhow to live.  What will they do who are only just born, and who\nmay live many years?  Certainly I am sorry for those spiritual\npeople who, for certain holy purposes, are obliged to live in the\nworld; the cross they have to carry is a dreadful one.  If they\ncould all agree together, and make themselves ignorant, and be\nwilling to be considered so in these sciences, they would set\nthemselves free from much trouble.  But what folly am I about!\nfrom speaking of the greatness of God I am come to speak of the\nmeanness of the world!  Since our Lord has given me the grace to\nquit it, I wish to leave it altogether.   Let them settle these\nmatters who maintain these follies with so much labour.\nGod grant that in the next life, where there is no changing, we\nmay not have to pay for them!  Amen.\n1.

One night I was so unwell that I thought I might be excused\nmaking my prayer; so I took my rosary, that I might employ myself\nin vocal prayer, trying not to be recollected in my\nunderstanding, though outwardly I was recollected, being in my\noratory.  These little precautions are of no use when our Lord\nwill have it otherwise.  I remained there but a few moments thus,\nwhen I was rapt in spirit with such violence that I could make no\nresistance whatever.  It seemed to me that I was taken up to\nheaven; and the first persons I saw there were my father and my\nmother.  I saw other things also; but the time was no longer than\nthat in which the Ave Maria might be said, and I was amazed at\nit, looking on it all as too great a grace for me.  But as to the\nshortness of the time, it might have been longer, only it was all\ndone in a very short space.\n2. I was afraid it might be an illusion; but as I did not think\nso, I knew not what to do, because I was very much ashamed to go\nto my confessor about it.  It was not, as it seemed to me,\nbecause I was humble, but because I thought he would laugh at me,\nand say: Oh, what a St. Paul!--she sees the things of heaven; or\na St. Jerome.  And because these glorious Saints had had such\nvisions, I was so much the more afraid, and did nothing but cry;\nfor I did not think it possible for me to see what they saw.\nAt last, though I felt it exceedingly, I went to my confessor;\nfor I never dared to keep secret anything of this kind, however\nmuch it distressed me to speak of them, owing to the great fear I\nhad of being deceived.  When my confessor saw how much I was\nsuffering, he consoled me greatly, and gave me plenty of good\nreasons why I should have no fear.\n3. It happened, also, as time went on, and it happens now from\ntime to time, that our Lord showed me still greater secrets.\nThe soul, even if it would, has neither the means not the power\nto see more than what He shows it; and so, each time, I saw\nnothing more than what our Lord was pleased to let me see.\nBut such was the vision, that the least part of it was enough to\nmake my soul amazed, and to raise it so high that it esteems and\ncounts as nothing all the things of this life.  I wish I could\ndescribe, in some measure, the smallest portion of what I saw;\nbut when I think of doing it, I find it impossible; for the mere\ndifference alone between the light we have here below, and that\nwhich is seen in a vision,--both being light,--is so great, that\nthere is no comparison between them; the brightness of the sun\nitself seems to be something exceedingly loathsome.  In a word,\nthe imagination, however strong it may be, can neither conceive\nnor picture to itself this light, nor any one of the things which\nour Lord showed me in a joy so supreme that it cannot be\ndescribed; for then all the senses exult so deeply and so sweetly\nthat no description is possible; and so it is better to say\nnothing more.\n4. I was in this state once for more than an hour, our Lord\nshowing me wonderful things.  He seemed as if He would not leave\nme.  He said to me, \"See, My daughter, what they lose who are\nagainst Me; do not fail to tell them of it.\"  Ah, my Lord, how\nlittle good my words will do them, who are made blind by their\nown conduct, if Thy Majesty will not give them light!  Some, to\nwhom Thou hast given it, there are, who have profited by the\nknowledge of Thy greatness; but as they see it revealed to one so\nwicked and base as I am, I look upon it as a great thing if there\nshould be any found to believe me.  Blessed be Thy name, and\nblessed be Thy compassion; for I can trace, at least in my own\nsoul, a visible improvement.  Afterwards I wished I had continued\nin that trance for ever, and that I had not returned to\nconsciousness, because of an abiding sense of contempt for\neverything here below; all seemed to be filth; and I see how\nmeanly we employ ourselves who are detained on earth.\n5. When I was staying with that lady of whom I have been\nspeaking, [1] it happened to me once when I was suffering from my\nheart,--for, as I have said, [2] I suffered greatly at one time,\nthough not so much now,--that she, being a person of great\ncharity, brought out her jewels set in gold, and precious stones\nof great price, and particularly a diamond, which she valued very\nmuch.  She thought this might amuse me; but I laughed to myself,\nand was very sorry to see what men made much of; for I thought of\nwhat our Lord had laid up for us, and considered how impossible\nit was for me, even if I made the effort, to have any\nappreciation whatever of such things, provided our Lord did not\npermit me to forget what He was keeping for us.\n6. A soul in this state attains to a certain freedom, which is so\ncomplete that none can understand it who does not possess it.\nIt is a real and true detachment, independent of our efforts; God\neffects it all Himself; for His Majesty reveals the truth in such\na way, that it remains so deeply impressed on our souls as to\nmake it clear that we of ourselves could not thus acquire it in\nso short a time.\n7. The fear of death, also, was now very slight in me, who had\nalways been in great dread of it; now it seems to me that death\nis a very light thing for one who serves God, because the soul is\nin a moment delivered thereby out of its prison, and at rest.\nThis elevation of the spirit, and the vision of things so high,\nin these trances seem to me to have a great likeness to the\nflight of the soul from the body, in that it finds itself in a\nmoment in the possession of these good things.  We put aside the\nagonies of its dissolution, of which no great account is to be\nmade; for they who love God in truth, and are utterly detached\nfrom the things of this life, must die with the\ngreater sweetness.\n8. It seems to me, also, that the rapture was a great help to\nrecognise our true home, and to see that we are pilgrims\nhere; [3] it is a great thing to see what is going on there and\nto know where we have to live; for if a person has to go and\nsettle in another country, it is a great help to him, in\nundergoing the fatigues of his journey, that he has discovered it\nto be a country where he may live in the most perfect peace.\nMoreover, it makes it easy for us to think of the things of\nheaven, and to have our conversation there. [4]  It is a great\ngain, because the mere looking up to heaven makes the soul\nrecollected; for as our Lord has been pleased to reveal heaven in\nsome degree, my soul dwells upon it in thought; and it happens\noccasionally that they who are about me, and with whom I find\nconsolation, are those whom I know to be living in heaven, and\nthat I look upon them only as really alive; while those who are\non earth are so dead, that the whole world seems unable to\nfurnish me with companions, particularly when these impetuosities\nof love are upon me. Everything seems a dream, and what I see\nwith the bodily eyes an illusion.  What I have seen with the eyes\nof the soul is that which my soul desires; and as it finds itself\nfar away from those things, that is death.\n9. In a word, it is a very great mercy which our Lord gives to\nthat soul to which He grants the like visions, for they help it\nin much, and also in carrying a heavy cross, since nothing\nsatisfies it, and everything is against it; and if our Lord did\nnot now and then suffer these visions to be forgotten, though\nthey recur again and again to the memory, I know not how life\ncould be borne.  May He be blessed and praised for ever and ever!\nI implore His Majesty by that Blood which His Son shed for me,\nnow that, of His good pleasure, I know something of these great\nblessings, and begin to have the fruition of them, that it may\nnot be with me as it was with Lucifer, who by his own fault\nforfeited it all.  I beseech Thee, for Thine own sake, not to\nsuffer this; for I am at times in great fear, though at others,\nand most frequently, the mercy of God reassures me, for He who\nhas delivered me from so many sins will not withdraw His hand\nfrom under me, and let me be lost.  I pray you, my father, to beg\nthis grace for me always.\n10. The mercies, then, hitherto described, are not, in my\nopinion, so great as those which I am now going to speak of, on\nmany accounts, because of the great blessings they have brought\nwith them, and because of the great fortitude which my soul\nderived from them; and yet every one separately considered is so\ngreat, that there is nothing to be compared with them.\n11. One day--it was the eve of Pentecost--I went after Mass to a\nvery lonely spot, where I used to pray very often, and began to\nread about the feast in the book of a Carthusian; [5] and reading\nof the marks by which beginners, proficients, and the perfect may\nknow that they have the Holy Ghost, it seemed to me, when I had\nread of these three states, that by the goodness of God, so far\nas I could understand, the Holy Ghost was with me.  I praised God\nfor it; and calling to mind how on another occasion, when I read\nthis, I was very deficient,--for I saw most distinctly at that\ntime how deficient I was then from what I saw I was now,--I\nrecognised herein the great mercy of our Lord to me, and so began\nto consider the place which my sins had earned for me in hell,\nand praised God exceedingly, because it seemed as if I did not\nknow my own soul again, so great a change had come over it.\n12. While thinking of these things, my soul was carried away with\nextreme violence, and I knew not why.  It seemed as if it would\nhave gone forth out of the body, for it could not contain itself,\nnor was it able to hope for so great a good.  The impetuosity was\nso excessive that I had no power left, and, as I think, different\nfrom what I had been used to.  I knew not what ailed my soul, nor\nwhat it desired, for it was so changed.  I leaned for support,\nfor I could not sit, because my natural strength had\nutterly failed.\n13. Then I saw over my head a dove, very different from those we\nusually see, for it had not the same plumage, but wings formed of\nsmall shells shining brightly.  It was larger than an ordinary\ndove; I thought I heard the rustling of its wings.  It hovered\nabove me during the space of an Ave Maria.  But such was the\nstate of my soul, that in losing itself it lost also the sight of\nthe dove.  My spirit grew calm with such a guest; and yet, as I\nthink, a grace so wonderful might have disturbed and frightened\nit; and as it began to rejoice in the vision, it was delivered\nfrom all fear, and with the joy came peace, my soul continuing\nentranced.  The joy of this rapture was exceedingly great; and\nfor the rest of that festal time I was so amazed and bewildered\nthat I did not know what I was doing, nor how I could have\nreceived so great a grace.  I neither heard nor saw anything, so\nto speak, because of my great inward joy.  From that day forth I\nperceived in myself a very great progress in the highest love of\nGod, together with a great increase in the strength of my\nvirtues.  May He be blessed and praised for ever!  Amen.\n14. On another occasion I saw that very dove above the head of\none of the Dominican fathers; but it seemed to me that the rays\nand brightness of the wings were far greater.  I understood by\nthis that he was to draw souls unto God.\n15. At another time I saw our Lady putting a cope of exceeding\nwhiteness on that Licentiate of the same Order, of whom I have\nmade mention more than once. [6]  She told me that she gave him\nthat cope in consideration of the service he had rendered her by\nhelping to found this house, [7] that it was a sign that she\nwould preserve his soul pure for the future, and that he should\nnot fall into mortal sin.  I hold it for certain that so it came\nto pass, for he died within a few years; his death and the rest\nof his life were so penitential, his whole life and death so\nholy, that, so far as anything can be known, there cannot be a\ndoubt on the subject.  One of the friars present at his death\ntold me that, before he breathed his last, he said to him that\nSt. Thomas was with him. [8]  He died in great joy, longing to\ndepart out of this land of exile.\n16. Since then he has appeared to me more than once in\nexceedingly great glory, and told me certain things.  He was so\ngiven to prayer, that when he was dying, and would have\ninterrupted it if he could because of his great weakness, he was\nnot able to do so; for he was often in a trance.  He wrote to me\nnot long before he died, and asked me what he was to do; for as\nsoon as he had said Mass he fell into a trance which lasted a\nlong time, and which he could not hinder.  At last God gave him\nthe reward of the many services of his whole life.\n17. I had certain visions, too, of the great graces which our\nLord bestowed upon that rector of the Society of Jesus, of whom I\nhave spoken already more than once; [9] but I will not say\nanything of them now, lest I should be too tedious.  It was his\nlot once to be in great trouble, to suffer great persecution and\ndistress.  One day, when I was hearing Mass, I saw Christ on the\nCross at the elevation of the Host.  He spoke certain words to\nme, which I was to repeat to that father for his comfort,\ntogether with others, which were to warn him beforehand of what\nwas coming, and to remind him of what He had suffered on his\nbehalf, and that he must prepare for suffering.  This gave him\ngreat consolation and courage; and everything came to pass\nafterwards as our Lord had told me.\n18. I have seen great things of members of the Order to which\nthis father belongs, which is the Society of Jesus, and of the\nwhole Order itself; I have occasionally seen them in heaven with\nwhite banners in their hands, and I have had other most wonderful\nvisions, as I am saying, about them, and therefore have a great\nveneration for this Order; for I have had a great deal to do with\nthose who are of it, and I see that their lives are conformed to\nthat which our Lord gave me to understand about them.\n19. One night, when I was in prayer, our Lord spoke to me certain\nwords, whereby He made me remember the great wickedness of my\npast life.  They filled me with shame and distress; for though\nthey were not spoken with severity, they caused a feeling and a\npainfulness which were too much for me: and we feel that we make\ngreater progress in the knowledge of ourselves when we hear one\nof these words, than we can make by a meditation of many days on\nour own misery, because these words impress the truth upon us at\nthe same time in such a way that we cannot resist it.  He set\nbefore me the former inclinations of my will to vanities, and\ntold me to make much of the desire I now had that my will, which\nhad been so ill employed, should be fixed on Him, and that He\nwould accept it.\n20. On other occasions He told me to remember how I used to think\nit an honourable thing to go against His honour; and, again, to\nremember my debt to Him, for when I was most rebellious He was\nbestowing His graces upon me.  If I am doing anything wrong--and\nmy wrong-doings are many--His Majesty makes me see it in such a\nway that I am utterly confounded; and as I do so often, that\nhappens often also.  I have been found fault with by my\nconfessors occasionally; and on betaking myself to prayer for\nconsolation, have received a real reprimand.\n21. To return to what I was speaking of.  When our Lord made me\nremember my wicked life, I wept; for as I considered that I had\nthen never done any good, I thought He might be about to bestow\nupon me some special grace; because most frequently, when I\nreceive any particular mercy from our Lord, it is when I have\nbeen previously greatly humiliated, in order that I may the more\nclearly see how far I am from deserving it.  I think our Lord\nmust do it for that end.\n22. Almost immediately after this I was so raised up in spirit\nthat I thought myself to be, as it were, out of the body; at\nleast, I did not know that I was living in it. [10]  I had a\nvision of the most Sacred Humanity in exceeding glory, greater\nthan I had ever seen It in before.  I beheld It in a wonderful\nand clear way in the bosom of the Father.  I cannot tell how it\nwas, for I saw myself, without seeing, as it seemed to me, in the\npresence of God.  My amazement was such that I remained, as I\nbelieve, some days before I could recover myself.  I had\ncontinually before me, as present, the Majesty of the Son of God,\nthough not so distinctly as in the vision.  I understood this\nwell enough; but the vision remained so impressed on my\nimagination, that I could not get rid of it for some time, though\nit had lasted but a moment; it is a great comfort to me, and also\na great blessing.\n23. I have had this vision on three other occasions, and it is, I\nthink, the highest vision of all the visions which our Lord in\nHis mercy showed me.  The fruits of it are the very greatest, for\nit seems to purify the soul in a wonderful way, and destroy, as\nit were utterly, altogether the strength of our sensual nature.\nIt is a grand flame of fire, which seems to burn up and\nannihilate all the desires of this life.  For though now--glory\nbe to God!--I had no desire after vanities, I saw clearly in the\nvision how all things are vanity, and how hollow are all the\ndignities of earth; it was a great lesson, teaching me to raise\nup my desires to the Truth alone.  It impresses on the soul a\nsense of the presence of God such as I cannot in any way\ndescribe, only it is very different from that which it is in our\nown power to acquire on earth.  It fills the soul with profound\nastonishment at its own daring, and at any one else being able to\ndare to offend His most awful Majesty.\n24. I must have spoken now and then of the effects of\nvisions, [11] and of other matters of the same kind, and I have\nalready said that the blessings they bring with them are of\nvarious degrees; but those of this vision are the highest of all.\nWhen I went to Communion once I called to mind the exceeding\ngreat majesty of Him I had seen, and considered that it was He\nwho is present in the most Holy Sacrament, and very often our\nLord was pleased to show Himself to me in the Host; the very\nhairs on my head stood, [12] and I thought I should come\nto nothing.\n25. O my Lord! ah, if Thou didst not throw a veil over Thy\ngreatness, who would dare, being so foul and miserable, to come\nin contact with Thy great Majesty?  Blessed be Thou, O Lord; may\nthe angels and all creation praise Thee, who orderest all things\naccording to the measure of our weakness, so that, when we have\nthe fruition of Thy sovereign mercies, Thy great power may not\nterrify us, so that we dare not, being a frail and miserable\nrace, persevere in that fruition!\n26. It might happen to us as it did to the labourer--I know it to\nbe a certain fact--who found a treasure beyond his expectations,\nwhich were mean.  When he saw himself in possession of it, he was\nseized with melancholy, which by degrees brought him to his grave\nthrough simple distress and anxiety of mind, because he did not\nknow what to do with his treasure.  If he had not found it all at\nonce, and if others had given him portions of it by degrees,\nmaintaining him thereby, he might have been more happy than he\nhad been in his poverty, nor would it have cost him his life.\n27. O Thou Treasure of the poor! how marvellously Thou sustainest\nsouls, showing to them, not all at once, but by little and\nlittle, the abundance of Thy riches!  When I behold Thy great\nMajesty hidden beneath that which is so slight as the Host is, I\nam filled with wonder, ever since that vision, at Thy great\nwisdom; and I know not how it is that our Lord gives me the\nstrength and courage necessary to draw near to him, were it not\nthat He who has had such compassion on me, and still has, gives\nme strength, nor would it be possible for me to be silent, or\nrefrain from making known marvels so great.\n28. What must be the thoughts of a wretched person such as I am,\nfull of abominations, and who has spent her life with so little\nfear of God, when she draws near to our Lord's great Majesty, at\nthe moment He is pleased to show Himself to my soul?  How can I\nopen my mouth, that has uttered so many words against Him, to\nreceive that most glorious Body, purity and compassion itself?\nThe love that is visible in His most beautiful Face, sweet and\ntender, pains and distresses the soul, because it has not served\nHim, more than all the terrors of His Majesty.  What should have\nbeen my thoughts, then, on those two occasions when I saw what I\nhave described?  Truly, O my Lord and my joy, I am going to say\nthat in some way, in these great afflictions of my soul, I have\ndone something in Thy service.  Ah!  I know not what I am saying,\nfor I am writing this as if the words were not mine, [13] because\nI am troubled, and in some measure beside myself, when I call\nthese things to remembrance.  If these thoughts were really mine,\nI might well say that I had done something for Thee, O my Lord;\nbut as I can have no good thought if Thou givest it not, no\nthanks are due to me; I am the debtor, O Lord, and it is Thou who\nart the offended One.\n29. Once, when I was going to Communion, I saw with the eyes of\nthe soul, more distinctly than with those of the body, two devils\nof most hideous shape; their horns seemed to encompass the throat\nof the poor priest; and I beheld my Lord, in that great majesty\nof which I have spoken, [14] held in the hands of that priest, in\nthe Host he was about to give me.  It was plain that those hands\nwere those of a sinner, and I felt that the soul of that priest\nwas in mortal sin.  What must it be, O my Lord, to look upon Thy\nbeauty amid shapes so hideous!  The two devils were so frightened\nand cowed in Thy presence, that they seemed as if they would have\nwillingly run away, hadst Thou but given them leave.  So troubled\nwas I by the vision, that I knew not how I could go to Communion.\nI was also in great fear, for I thought, if the vision was from\nGod, that His Majesty would not have allowed me to see the evil\nstate of that soul. [15]\n30. Our Lord Himself told me to pray for that priest; that He had\nallowed this in order that I might understand the power of the\nwords of consecration, and how God failed not to be present,\nhowever wicked the priest might be who uttered them; and that I\nmight see His great goodness in that He left Himself in the very\nhands of His enemy, for my good and for the good of all.\nI understood clearly how the priests are under greater\nobligations to be holy than other persons; and what a horrible\nthing it is to receive this most Holy Sacrament unworthily, and\nhow great is the devil's dominion over a soul in mortal sin.\nIt did me a great service, and made me fully understand what I\nowe to God.  May He be blessed for evermore!\n31. At another time I had a vision of a different kind, which\nfrightened me very much.  I was in a place where a certain person\ndied, who as I understood had led a very bad life, and that for\nmany years.  But he had been ill for two years, and in some\nrespects seemed to have reformed.  He died without confession;\nnevertheless, I did not think he would be damned.  When the body\nhad been wrapped in the winding-sheet, I saw it laid hold of by a\nmultitude of devils, who seemed to toss it to and fro, and also\nto treat it with great cruelty.  I was terrified at the sight,\nfor they dragged it about with great hooks.  But when I saw it\ncarried to the grave with all the respect and ceremoniousness\ncommon to all, I began to think of the goodness of God, who would\nnot allow that person to be dishonoured, but would have the fact\nof his being His enemy concealed.\n32. I was almost out of my senses at the sight.  During the whole\nof the funeral service, I did not see one of the evil spirits.\nAfterwards, when the body was about to be laid in the grave, so\ngreat a multitude of them was therein waiting to receive it, that\nI was beside myself at the sight, and it required no slight\ncourage on my part not to betray my distress. I thought of the\ntreatment which that soul would receive, when the devils had such\npower over the wretched body.  Would to God that all who live in\nmortal sin might see what I then saw,--it was a fearful sight; it\nwould go, I believe, a great way towards making them lead\nbetter lives.\n33. All this made me know more of what I owe to God, and of the\nevils from which He has delivered me.  I was in great terror.\nI spoke of it to my confessor, and I thought it might be an\nillusion of Satan, in order to take away my good opinion of that\nperson, who yet was not accounted a very good Christian.\nThe truth is, that, whether it was an illusion or not, it makes\nme afraid whenever I think of it.\n34. Now that I have begun to speak of the visions I had\nconcerning the dead, I will mention some matters which our Lord\nwas pleased to reveal to me in relation to certain souls.  I will\nconfine myself to a few for the sake of brevity, and because they\nare not necessary; I mean that they are not for our profit.\nThey told me that one who had been our Provincial--he was then of\nanother province--was dead.  He was a man of great virtue, with\nwhom I had had a great deal to do, and to whom I was under many\nobligations for certain kindnesses shown me.  When I heard that\nhe was dead, I was exceedingly troubled, because I trembled for\nhis salvation, seeing that he had been superior for twenty years.\nThat is what I dread very much; for the cure of souls seems to me\nto be full of danger.  I went to an oratory in great distress,\nand gave up to him all the good I had ever done in my whole\nlife,--it was little enough,--and prayed our Lord that His merits\nmight fill up what was wanting, in order that this soul might be\ndelivered up from purgatory.\n35. While I was thus praying to our Lord as well as I could, he\nseemed to me to rise up from the depths of the earth on my right\nhand, and I saw him ascend to heaven in exceeding great joy.\nHe was a very old man then, but I saw him as if he were only\nthirty years old, and I thought even younger, and there was a\nbrightness in his face.  This vision passed away very quickly;\nbut I was so exceedingly comforted by it, that I could never\nagain mourn his death, although many persons were distressed at\nit, for he was very much beloved.  So greatly comforted was my\nsoul, that nothing disturbed it, neither could I doubt the truth\nof the vision; I mean that it was no illusion.\n36. I had this vision about a fortnight after he was dead;\nnevertheless, I did not omit to obtain prayers for him and I\nprayed myself, only I could not pray with the same earnestness\nthat I should have done if I had not seen that vision.  For when\nour Lord showed him thus to me, it seemed to me afterwards, when\nI prayed for him to His Majesty,--and I could not help it,--that\nI was like one who gave alms to a rich man.  Later on I heard an\naccount of the death he died in our Lord--he was far away from\nhere; it was one of such great edification, that he left all\nwondering to see how recollected, how penitent, and how humble he\nwas when he died.\n37. A nun, who was a great servant of God, died in this house.\nOn the next day one of the sisters was reciting the lesson in the\nOffice of the Dead, which was said in choir for that nun's soul,\nand I was standing myself to assist her in singing the versicle,\nwhen, in the middle of the lesson, I saw the departed nun as I\nbelieve, in a vision; her soul seemed to rise on my right hand\nlike the soul of the Provincial, and ascend to heaven.\nThis vision was not imaginary, like the preceding, but like those\nothers of which I have spoken before; [16] it is not less\ncertain, however, than the other visions I had.\n38. Another nun died in this same house of mine, she was about\neighteen or twenty years of age, and had always been sickly.\nShe was a great servant of God, attentive in choir, and a person\nof great virtue.  I certainly thought that she would not go to\npurgatory, on account of her exceeding merits, because the\ninfirmities under which she had laboured were many.  While I was\nsaying the Office, before she was buried,--she had been dead\nabout four hours,--I saw her rise in the same place and ascend\nto heaven.\n39. I was once in one of the colleges of the Society of Jesus,\nand in one of those great sufferings which, as I have said, [17]\nI occasionally had, and still have, both in soul and body, and\nthen so grievously that I was not able, as it seemed to me, to\nhave even one good thought.  The night before, one of the\nbrothers of that house had died in it; and I, as well as I could,\nwas commending his soul to God, and hearing the Mass which\nanother father of that Society was saying for him when I became\nrecollected at once, and saw him go up to heaven in great glory,\nand our Lord with him.  I understood that His Majesty went with\nhim by way of special grace.\n40. Another brother of our Order, a good friar, was very ill; and\nwhen I was at Mass, I became recollected and saw him dead,\nentering into heaven without going through purgatory.  He died,\nas I afterwards learned, at the very time of my vision.  I was\namazed that he had not gone to purgatory.  I understood that,\nhaving become a friar and carefully kept the rule, the Bulls of\nthe Order had been of use to him, so that he did not pass into\npurgatory.  I do not know why I came to have this revealed to me;\nI think it must be because I was to learn that it is not enough\nfor a man to be a friar in his habit--I mean, to wear the\nhabit--to attain to that state of high perfection which that of a\nfriar is.\n41. I will speak no more of these things, because as I have just\nsaid, [18] there is no necessity for it, though our Lord has been\nso gracious to me as to show me much.  But in all the visions I\nhad, I saw no souls escape purgatory except this Carmelite\nfather, the holy friar Peter of Alcantara, and that Dominican\nfather of whom I spoke before. [19]  It pleased our Lord to let\nme see the degree of glory to which some souls have been raised,\nshowing them to me in the places they occupy.  There is a great\ndifference between one place and another.\n1. Ch. xxxiv.  Do\u00f1a Luisa de la Cerda, at Toledo.\n2. Ch. iv. \u00a7 6.\n3. 1 St. Peter ii. 11: \"Advenas et peregrinos.\"\n4.

I was once importuning our Lord exceedingly to restore the\nsight of a person who had claims upon me, and who was almost\nwholly blind.  I was very sorry for him, and afraid our Lord\nwould not hear me because of my sins.  He appeared to me as at\nother times, and began to show the wound in His left hand; with\nthe other He drew out the great nail that was in it, and it\nseemed to me that, in drawing the nail, He tore the flesh.\nThe greatness of the pain was manifest, and I was very much\ndistressed thereat.  He said to me, that He who had borne that\nfor my sake would still more readily grant what I asked Him, and\nthat I was not to have any doubts about it.  He promised me there\nwas nothing I should ask that He would not grant; that He knew I\nshould ask nothing that was not for His glory, and that He would\ngrant me what I was now praying for.  Even during the time when I\ndid not serve Him, I should find, if I considered it, I had asked\nnothing that He had not granted in an ampler manner than I had\nknown how to ask; how much more amply still would He grant what I\nasked for, now that He knew I loved Him!  I was not to doubt.\nI do not think that eight days passed before our Lord restored\nthat person to sight.  My confessor knew it forthwith.  It might\nbe that it was not owing to my prayer; but, as I had had the\nvision, I have a certain conviction that it was a grace accorded\nto me.  I gave thanks to His Majesty.\n2. Again, a person was exceedingly ill of a most painful disease;\nbut, as I do not know what it was, I do not describe it by its\nname here.  What he had gone through for two months was beyond\nall endurance; and his pain was so great that he tore his own\nflesh.  My confessor, the rector of whom I have spoken, [1] went\nto see him; he was very sorry for him, and told me that I must\nanyhow go myself and visit him; he was one whom I might visit,\nfor he was my kinsman.  I went, and was moved to such a tender\ncompassion for him that I began, with the utmost importunity, to\nask our Lord to restore him to health.  Herein I saw clearly how\ngracious our Lord was to me, so far as I could judge; for\nimmediately, the next day, he was completely rid of that pain.\n3. I was once in the deepest distress, because I knew that a\nperson to whom I was under great obligations was about to commit\nan act highly offensive to God and dishonourable to himself.\nHe was determined upon it.  I was so much harassed by this that I\ndid not know what to do in order to change his purpose; and it\nseemed to me as if nothing could be done.  I implored God, from\nthe bottom of my heart, to find a way to hinder it; but till I\nfound it I could find no relief for the pain I felt.  In my\ndistress, I went to a very lonely hermitage,--one of those\nbelonging to this monastery,--in which there is a picture of\nChrist bound to the pillar; and there, as I was imploring our\nLord to grant me this grace, I heard a voice of exceeding\ngentleness, speaking, as it were, in a whisper. [2]  My whole\nbody trembled, for it made me afraid.  I wished to understand\nwhat was said, but I could not, for it all passed away in\na moment.\n4. When my fears had subsided, and that was immediately, I became\nconscious of an inward calmness, a joy and delight, which made me\nmarvel how the mere hearing a voice,--I heard it with my bodily\nears,--without understanding a word, could have such an effect on\nthe soul.  I saw by this that my prayer was granted; and so it\nwas; and I was freed from my anxieties about a matter not yet\naccomplished, as it afterwards was, as completely as if I saw it\ndone.  I told my confessors of it, for I had two at this time,\nboth of them learned men, and great servants of God.\n5. I knew of a person who had resolved to serve God in all\nearnestness, and had for some days given himself to prayer, in\nwhich he bad received many graces from our Lord, but who had\nabandoned his good resolutions because of certain occasions of\nsin in which he was involved, and which he would not avoid; they\nwere extremely perilous.  This caused me the utmost distress,\nbecause the person was one for whom I had a great affection, and\none to whom I owed much.  For more than a month I believe I did\nnothing else but pray to God for his conversion.  One day, when I\nwas in prayer, I saw a devil close by in a great rage, tearing to\npieces some paper which he had in his hands.  That sight consoled\nme greatly, because it seemed that my prayer had been heard.\nSo it was, as I learnt afterwards; for that person had made his\nconfession with great contrition, and returned to God so\nsincerely, that I trust in His Majesty he will always advance\nfurther and further.  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.\n6. In answer to my prayers, our Lord has very often rescued souls\nfrom mortal sins and led others on to greater perfection. But as\nto the delivering of souls out of purgatory, and other remarkable\nacts, so many are the mercies of our Lord herein, that were I to\nspeak of them I should only weary myself and my reader. But He\nhas done more by me for the salvation of souls than for the\nhealth of the body.  This is very well known, and there are many\nto bear witness to it.\n7. At first it made me scrupulous, because I could not help\nthinking that our Lord did these things in answer to my prayer; I\nsay nothing of the chief reason of all--His pure compassion.  But\nnow these graces are so many, and so well known to others, that\nit gives me no pain to think so.  I bless His Majesty, and abase\nmyself, because I am still more deeply in His debt; and I believe\nthat He makes my desire to serve Him grow, and my love revive.\n8. But what amazes me most is this: however much I may wish to\npray for those graces which our Lord sees not to be expedient, I\ncannot do it; and if I try, I do so with little earnestness,\nforce, and spirit: it is impossible to do more, even if I would.\nBut it is not so as to those which His Majesty intends to grant.\nThese I can pray for constantly, and with great importunity;\nthough I do not carry them in my memory, they seem to present\nthemselves to me at once. [3]\n9. There is a great difference between these two ways of praying,\nand I know not how to explain it.  As to the first, when I pray\nfor those graces which our Lord does not mean to grant,--even\nthough they concern me very nearly,--I am like one whose tongue\nis tied; who, though he would speak, yet cannot; or, if he\nspeaks, sees that people do not listen to him.  And yet I do not\nfail to force myself to pray, though not conscious of that\nfervour which I have when praying for those graces which our Lord\nintends to give.  In the second case, I am like one who speaks\nclearly and intelligibly to another, whom he sees to be a\nwilling listener.\n10. The prayer that is not to be heard is, so to speak, like\nvocal prayer; the other is a prayer of contemplation so high that\nour Lord shows Himself in such a way as to make us feel He hears\nus, and that He delights in our prayer, and that He is about to\ngrant our petition.  Blessed be He for ever who gives me so much\nand to whom I give so little!  For what is he worth, O my Lord,\nwho does not utterly abase himself to nothing for Thee?  How\nmuch, how much, how much,--I might say so a thousand times,--I\nfall short of this!  It is on this account that I do not wish to\nlive,--though there be other reasons also,--because I do not live\naccording to the obligations which bind me to Thee.\nWhat imperfections I trace in myself! what remissness in Thy\nservice! Certainly, I could wish occasionally I had no sense,\nthat I might be unconscious of the great evil that is in me.\nMay He who can do all things help me!\n11. When I was staying in the house of that lady of whom I have\nspoken before, [4] it was necessary for me to be very watchful\nover myself, and keep continually in mind the intrinsic vanity of\nall the things of this life, because of the great esteem I was\nheld in, and of the praises bestowed on me.  There was much there\nto which I might have become attached, if I had looked only to\nmyself; but I looked to Him who sees things as they really are,\nnot to let me go out of His hand.  Now that I speak of seeing\nthings as they really are, I remember how great a trial it is for\nthose to whom God has granted a true insight into the things of\nearth to have to discuss them with others.  They wear so many\ndisguises, as our Lord once told me,--and much of what I am\nsaying of them is not from myself, but rather what my Heavenly\nMaster has taught me; and therefore, in speaking of them, when I\nsay distinctly I understood this, or our Lord told me this, I am\nvery scrupulous neither to add nor to take away one single\nsyllable; so, when I do not clearly remember everything exactly,\nthat must be taken as coming from myself, and some things,\nperhaps, are so altogether.  I do not call mine that which is\ngood, for I know there is no other good in me but only that which\nour Lord gave me when I was so far from deserving it: I call that\nmine which I speak without having had it made known to me\nby revelation.\n12. But, O my God, how is it that we too often judge even\nspiritual things, as we do those of the world, by our own\nunderstanding, wresting them grievously from their true meaning?\nWe think we may measure our progress by the years which we have\ngiven to the exercise of prayer; we even think we can prescribe\nlimits to Him who bestows His gifts not by measure [5] when He\nwills, and who in six months can give to one more than to another\nin many years.  This is a fact which I have so frequently\nobserved in many persons, that I am surprised how any of us can\ndeny it.\n13. I am certainly convinced that he will not remain under this\ndelusion who possesses the gift of discerning spirits, and to\nwhom our Lord has given real humility; for such a one will judge\nof them by the fruits, by the good resolutions and love,--and our\nLord gives him light to understand the matter; and herein He\nregards the progress and advancement of souls, not the years they\nmay have spent in prayer; for one person may make greater\nprogress in six months than another in twenty years, because, as\nI said before, our Lord gives to whom He will, particularly to\nhim who is best disposed.\n14. I see this in certain persons of tender years who have come\nto this monastery,--God touches their hearts, and gives them a\nlittle light and love.  I speak of that brief interval in which\nHe gives them sweetness in prayer, and then they wait for nothing\nfurther, and make light of every difficulty, forgetting the\nnecessity even of food; for they shut themselves up for ever in a\nhouse that is unendowed, as persons who make no account of their\nlife, for His sake, who, they know, loves them.  They give up\neverything, even their own will; and it never enters into their\nmind that they might be discontented in so small a house, and\nwhere enclosure is so strictly observed.  They offer themselves\nwholly in sacrifice to God.\n15. Oh, how willingly do I admit that they are better than I am!\nand how I ought to be ashamed of myself before God!  What His\nMajesty has not been able to accomplish in me in so many\nyears,--it is long ago since I began to pray, and He to bestow\nHis graces upon me,--He accomplished in them in three months, and\nin some of them even in three days, though he gives them much\nfewer graces than He gave to me: and yet His Majesty rewards them\nwell; most assuredly they are not sorry for what they have done\nfor Him.\n16. I wish, therefore, we reminded ourselves of those long years\nwhich have gone by since we made our religious profession.  I say\nthis to those persons, also, who have given themselves long ago\nto prayer, but not for the purpose of distressing those who in a\nshort time have made greater progress than we have made, by\nmaking them retrace their steps, so that they may proceed only as\nwe do ourselves.  We must not desire those who, because of the\ngraces God has given them, are flying like eagles, to become like\nchickens whose feet are tied.  Let us rather look to His Majesty,\nand give these souls the reins, if we see that they are humble;\nfor our Lord, who has had such compassion upon them, will not let\nthem fall into the abyss.\n17. These souls trust themselves in the hands of God, for the\ntruth, which they learn by faith, helps them to do it; and shall\nnot we also trust them to Him, without seeking to measure them by\nour measure which is that of our meanness of spirit?  We must not\ndo it; for if we cannot ascend to the heights of their great love\nand courage,--without experience none can comprehend them--let us\nhumble ourselves, and not condemn them; for, by this seeming\nregard to their progress, we hinder our own, and miss the\nopportunity our Lord gives us to humble ourselves, to ascertain\nour own shortcomings, and learn how much more detached and more\nnear to God these souls must be than we are, seeing that His\nMajesty draws so near to them Himself.\n18. I have no other intention here, and I wish to have no other,\nthan to express my preference for the prayer that in a short time\nresults in these great effects, which show themselves at once;\nfor it is impossible they should enable us to leave all things\nonly to please God, if they were not accompanied with a vehement\nlove.  I would rather have that prayer than that which lasted\nmany years, but which at the end of the time, as well as at the\nbeginning, never issued in a resolution to do anything for God,\nwith the exception of some trifling services, like a grain of\nsalt, without weight or bulk, and which a bird might carry away\nin its mouth.  Is it not a serious and mortifying thought that we\nare making much of certain services which we render our Lord, but\nwhich are too pitiable to be considered, even if they were many\nin number?  This is my case, and I am forgetting every moment the\nmercies of our Lord.  I do not mean that His Majesty will not\nmake much of them Himself, for He is good; but I wish I made no\naccount of them myself, or even perceived that I did them, for\nthey are nothing worth.\n19. But, O my Lord, do Thou forgive me, and blame me not, if I\ntry to console myself a little with the little I do, seeing that\nI do not serve Thee at all; for if I rendered Thee any great\nservices, I should not think of these trifles.  Blessed are they\nwho serve Thee in great deeds; if envying these, and desiring to\ndo what they do, were of any help to me, I should not be so far\nbehind them as I am in pleasing Thee; but I am nothing worth, O\nmy Lord; do Thou make me of some worth, Thou who lovest me\nso much.\n20. During one of those days, when this monastery, which seems to\nhave cost me some labour, was fully founded by the arrival of the\nBrief from Rome, which empowered us to live without an\nendowment; [6] and I was comforting myself at seeing the whole\naffair concluded, and thinking of all the trouble I had had, and\ngiving thanks to our Lord for having been pleased to make some\nuse of me,--it happened that I began to consider all that we had\ngone through.  Well, so it was; in every one of my actions, which\nI thought were of some service, I traced so many faults and\nimperfections, now and then but little courage, very frequently a\nwant of faith; for until this moment, when I see everything\naccomplished, I never absolutely believed; neither, however, on\nthe other hand, could I doubt what our Lord said to me about the\nfoundation of this house.  I cannot tell how it was; very often\nthe matter seemed to me, on the one hand, impossible; and, on the\nother hand, I could not be in doubt; I mean, I could not believe\nthat it would not be accomplished.  In short, I find that our\nLord Himself, on His part, did all the good that was done, while\nI did all the evil.  I therefore ceased to think of the matter,\nand wished never to be reminded of it again, lest I should do\nmyself some harm by dwelling on my many faults. Blessed be He\nwho, when He pleases, draws good out of all my failings!  Amen.\n21. I say, then, there is danger in counting the years we have\ngiven to prayer; for, granting that there is nothing in it\nagainst humility, it seems to me to imply something like an\nappearance of thinking that we have merited, in some degree, by\nthe service rendered.  I do not mean that there is no merit in it\nat all, nor that it will not be well rewarded; yet if any\nspiritual person thinks, because he has given himself to prayer\nfor many years, that he deserves any spiritual consolations, I am\nsure he will never attain to spiritual perfection.  Is it not\nenough that a man has merited the protection of God, which keeps\nhim from committing those sins into which he fell before he began\nto pray, but he must also, as they say, sue God for His\nown money?\n22. This does not seem to me to be deep humility, and yet it may\nbe that it is; however, I look on it as great boldness, for I,\nwho have very little humility, have never ventured upon it.\nIt may be that I never asked for it, because I had never served\nHim; perhaps, if I had served Him, I should have been more\nimportunate than all others with our Lord for my reward.\n23. I do not mean that the soul makes no progress in time, or\nthat God will not reward it, if its prayer has been humble; but I\ndo mean that we should forget the number of years we have been\npraying, because all that we can do is utterly worthless in\ncomparison with one drop of blood out of those which our Lord\nshed for us.  And if the more we serve Him, the more we become\nHis debtors, what is it, then, we are asking for? for, if we pay\none farthing of the debt, He gives us back a thousand ducats.\nFor the love of God, let us leave these questions alone, for they\nbelong to Him.  Comparisons are always bad, even in earthly\nthings; what, then, must they be in that, the knowledge of which\nGod has reserved to Himself? His Majesty showed this clearly\nenough, when those who came late and those who came early to His\nvineyard received the same wages. [7]\n24. I have sat down so often to write, and have been so many days\nwriting these three leaves,--for, as I have said, [8] I had, and\nhave still, but few opportunities,--that I forgot what I had\nbegun with, namely, the following vision. [9]\n25. I was in prayer, and saw myself on a wide plain all alone.\nRound about me stood a great multitude of all kinds of people,\nwho hemmed me in on every side; all of them seemed to have\nweapons of war in their hands, to hurt me; some had spears,\nothers swords; some had daggers, and others very long rapiers.\nIn short, I could not move away in any direction without exposing\nmyself to the hazard of death, and I was alone, without any one\nto take my part.  In this my distress of mind, not knowing what\nto do, I lifted up my eyes to heaven, and saw Christ, not in\nheaven, but high above me in the air, holding out His hand to me,\nand there protecting me in such a way that I was no longer afraid\nof all that multitude, neither could they, though they wished it,\ndo me any harm.\n26. At first the vision seemed to have no results; but it has\nbeen of the greatest help to me, since I understood what it\nmeant.  Not long afterwards, I saw myself, as it were, exposed to\nthe like assault, and I saw that the vision represented the\nworld, because everything in it takes up arms against the poor\nsoul.  We need not speak of those who are not great servants of\nour Lord, nor of honours, possessions, and pleasures, with other\nthings of the same nature; for it is clear that the soul, if it\nbe not watchful, will find itself caught in a net,--at least, all\nthese things labour to ensnare it; more than this, so also do\nfriends and relatives, and--what frightens me most--even good\npeople.  I found myself afterwards so beset on all sides, good\npeople thinking they were doing good, and I knowing not how to\ndefend myself, nor what to do.\n27. O my God, if I were to say in what way, and in how many ways,\nI was tried at that time, even after that trial of which I have\njust spoken, what a warning I should be giving to men to hate the\nwhole world utterly!  It was the greatest of all the persecutions\nI had to undergo.  I saw myself occasionally so hemmed in on\nevery side, that I could do nothing else but lift up my eyes to\nheaven, and cry unto God. [10] I recollected well what I had seen\nin the vision, and it helped me greatly not to trust much in any\none, for there is no one that can be relied on except God.\nIn all my great trials, our Lord--He showed it to me--sent always\nsome one on His part to hold out his hand to help me, as it was\nshown to me in the vision, so that I might attach myself to\nnothing, but only please our Lord; and this has been enough to\nsustain the little virtue I have in desiring to serve Thee: be\nThou blessed for evermore!\n28. On one occasion I was exceedingly disquieted and troubled,\nunable to recollect myself, fighting and struggling with my\nthoughts, running upon matters which did not relate to\nperfection; and, moreover, I did not think I was so detached from\nall things as I used to be.  When I found myself in this wretched\nstate, I was afraid that the graces I had received from our Lord\nwere illusions, and the end was that a great darkness covered my\nsoul.  In this my distress our Lord began to speak to me: He bade\nme not to harass myself, but learn, from the consideration of my\nmisery, what it would be if He withdrew Himself from me, and that\nwe were never safe while living in the flesh.  It was given me to\nunderstand how this fighting and struggling are profitable to us,\nbecause of the reward, and it seemed to me as if our Lord were\nsorry for us who live in the world.  Moreover, He bade me not to\nsuppose that He had forgotten me; He would never abandon me, but\nit was necessary I should do all that I could myself.\n29. Our Lord said all this with great tenderness and sweetness;\nHe also spoke other most gracious words, which I need not repeat.\nHis Majesty, further showing His great love for me, said to me\nvery often: \"Thou art Mine, and I am thine.\"  I am in the habit\nof saying myself, and I believe in all sincerity: \"What do I care\nfor myself?--I care only for Thee, O my Lord.\"\n30. These words of our Lord, and the consolation He gives me,\nfill me with the utmost shame, when I remember what I am.  I have\nsaid it before, I think, [11] and I still say now and then to my\nconfessor, that it requires greater courage to receive these\ngraces than to endure the heaviest trials.  When they come, I\nforget, as it were, all I have done, and there is nothing before\nme but a picture of my wretchedness, and my understanding can\nmake no reflections; this, also, seems to me at times to\nbe supernatural.\n31. Sometimes I have such a vehement longing for Communion; I do\nnot think it can be expressed.  One morning it happened to rain\nso much as to make it seem impossible to leave the house.  When I\nhad gone out, I was so beside myself with that longing, that if\nspears had been pointed at my heart, I should have rushed upon\nthem; the rain was nothing.  When I entered the church I fell\ninto a deep trance, and saw heaven open--not a door only, as I\nused to see at other times.  I beheld the throne which, as I have\ntold you, my father, I saw at other times, with another throne\nabove it, whereon, though I saw not, I understood by a certain\ninexplicable knowledge that the Godhead dwelt.\n32. The throne seemed to me to be supported by certain animals; I\nbelieve I saw the form of them: I thought they might be the\nEvangelists.  But how the throne was arrayed, and Him who sat on\nit I did not see, but only an exceedingly great multitude of\nangels, who seemed to me more beautiful, beyond all comparison,\nthan those I had seen in heaven.  I thought they were, perhaps,\nthe seraphim or cherubim, for they were very different in their\nglory, and seemingly all on fire.  The difference is great, as I\nsaid before; [12] and the joy I then felt cannot be described,\neither in writing or by word of mouth; it is inconceivable to any\none what has not had experience of it. I felt that everything man\ncan desire was all there together, and I saw nothing; they told\nme, but I know not who, that all I could do there was to\nunderstand that I could understand nothing, and see how\neverything was nothing in comparison with that.  So it was; my\nsoul afterwards was vexed to see that it could rest on any\ncreated thing: how much more, then, if it had any affection\nthereto; for everything seemed to me but an ant-hill.\nI communicated, and remained during Mass.  I know not how it was:\nI thought I had been but a few minutes, and was amazed when the\nclock struck; I had been two hours in that trance and joy.\n33. I was afterwards amazed at this fire, which seems to spring\nforth out of the true love of God; for though I might long for\nit, labour for it, and annihilate myself in the effort to obtain\nit, I can do nothing towards procuring a single spark of it\nmyself, because it all comes of the good pleasure of His Majesty,\nas I said on another occasion. [13]  It seems to burn up the old\nman, with his faults, his lukewarmness, and misery; so that it is\nlike the phoenix, of which I have read that it comes forth, after\nbeing burnt, out of its own ashes into a new life.  Thus it is\nwith the soul: it is changed into another, whose desires are\ndifferent, and whose strength is great.  It seems to be no longer\nwhat it was before, and begins to walk renewed in purity in the\nways of our Lord.  When I was praying to Him that thus it might\nbe with me, and that I might begin His service anew, He said to\nme: \"The comparison thou hast made is good; take care never to\nforget it, that thou mayest always labour to advance.\"\n34. Once, when I was doubting, as I said just now, [14] whether\nthese visions came from God or not, our Lord appeared, and, with\nsome severity, said to me: \"O children of men, how long will you\nremain hard of heart!\"  I was to examine myself carefully on one\nsubject,--whether I had given myself up wholly to Him, or not.\nIf I had,--and it was so,--I was to believe that He would not\nsuffer me to perish.  I was very much afflicted when He spoke\nthus, but He turned to me with great tenderness and sweetness,\nand bade me not to distress myself, for He knew already that, so\nfar as it lay in my power, I would not fail in anything that was\nfor His service; that He Himself would do what I wished,--and so\nHe did grant what I was then praying for; that I was to consider\nmy love for Him, which was daily growing in me, for I should see\nby this that these visions did not come from Satan; that I must\nnot imagine that God would ever allow the devil to have so much\npower over the souls of His servants as to give them such\nclearness of understanding and such peace as I had.\n35. He gave me also to understand that, when such and so many\npersons had told me the visions were from God, I should do wrong\nif I did not believe them. [15]\n36. Once, when I was reciting the psalm Quicumque vult, [16] I\nwas given to understand the mystery of One God and Three Persons\nwith so much clearness, that I was greatly astonished and\nconsoled at the same time.  This was of the greatest help to me,\nfor it enabled me to know more of the greatness and marvels of\nGod; and when I think of the most Holy Trinity, or hear It spoken\nof, I seem to understand the mystery, and a great joy it is.\n37. One day--it was the Feast of the Assumption of the Queen of\nthe Angels, and our Lady--our Lord was pleased to grant me this\ngrace.  In a trance He made me behold her going up to heaven, the\njoy and solemnity of her reception there, as well as the place\nwhere she now is.  To describe it is more than I can do; the joy\nthat filled my soul at the sight of such great glory was\nexcessive.  The effects of the vision were great; it made me long\nto endure still greater trials: and I had a vehement desire to\nserve our Lady, because of her great merits.\n38. Once, in one of the colleges of the Society of Jesus, when\nthe brothers of the house were communicating, I saw an\nexceedingly rich canopy above their heads.  I saw this twice; but\nI never saw it when others were receiving Communion.\n1. Ch. xxxiii. \u00a7 10.  F. Gaspar de Salazar.\n2. 3 Kings xix. 12: \"Sibilus aur\u00e6 tenuis.\"\n3.

Commonly called the Creed of St. Athanasius.\nChapter XL.\nVisions, Revelations, and Locutions.\n1. One day, in prayer, the sweetness of which was so great that,\nknowing how unworthy I was of so great a blessing, I began to\nthink how much I had deserved to be in that place which I had\nseen prepared for me in hell,--for, as I said before, [1] I never\nforget the way I saw myself there,--as I was thinking of this, my\nsoul began to be more and more on fire, and I was carried away in\nspirit in a way I cannot describe.  It seemed to me as if I had\nbeen absorbed in, and filled with, that grandeur of God which, on\nanother occasion, I had felt. [2]  In that majesty it was given\nme to understand one truth, which is the fulness of all truth,\nbut I cannot tell how, for I saw nothing.  It was said to me, I\nsaw not by whom, but I knew well enough it was the Truth Itself:\n\"This I am doing to thee is not a slight matter; it is one of\nthose things for which thou owest Me much; for all the evil in\nthe world comes from ignorance of the truths of the holy writings\nin their clear simplicity, of which not one iota shall pass\naway.\" [3]  I thought that I had always believed this, and that\nall the faithful also believed it.  Then he said,: \"Ah, My\ndaughter, they are few who love Me in truth; for if men loved Me,\nI should not hide My secrets from them.  Knowest thou what it is\nto love Me in truth?  It is to admit everything to be a lie which\nis not pleasing unto Me.  Now thou dost not understand it, but\nthou shalt understand it clearly hereafter, in the profit it will\nbe to thy soul.\"\n2. Our Lord be praised, so I found it; for after this vision I\nlook upon everything which does not tend to the service of God as\nvanity and lies.  I cannot tell how much I am convinced of this,\nnor how sorry I am for those whom I see living in darkness, not\nknowing the truth.  I derived other great blessings also from\nthis, some of which I will here speak of, others I cannot\ndescribe.\n3. Our Lord at the same time uttered a special word of most\nexceeding graciousness.  I know not how it was done, for I saw\nnothing; but I was filled, in a way which also I cannot describe,\nwith exceeding strength and earnestness of purpose to observe\nwith all my might everything contained in the divine writings.\nI thought that I could rise above every possible hindrance put in\nmy way.\n4. Of this divine truth, which was put before me I know not how,\nthere remains imprinted within me a truth--I cannot give it a\nname--which fills me with a new reverence for God; it gives me a\nnotion of His Majesty and power in a way which I cannot explain.\nI can understand that it is something very high.  I had a very\ngreat desire never to speak of anything but of those deep truths\nwhich far surpass all that is spoken of here in the world,--and\nso the living in it began to be painful to me.\n5. The vision left me in great tenderness, joy, and humility.\nIt seemed to me, though I knew not how, that our Lord now gave me\ngreat things; and I had no suspicion whatever of any illusion.\nI saw nothing; but I understood how great a blessing it is to\nmake no account of anything which does not lead us nearer unto\nGod.  I also understood what it is for a soul to be walking in\nthe truth, in the presence of the Truth itself.  What I\nunderstood is this: that our Lord gave me to understand that He\nis Himself the very Truth.\n6. All this I am speaking of I learnt at times by means of words\nuttered; at other times I learnt some things without the help of\nwords, and that more clearly than those other things which were\ntold me in words.  I understood exceedingly deep truths\nconcerning the Truth, more than I could have done through the\nteaching of many learned men.  It seems to me that learned men\nnever could have thus impressed upon me, nor so clearly explained\nto me, the vanity of this world.\n7. The Truth of which I am speaking, and which I was given to\nsee, is Truth Itself, in Itself.  It has neither beginning nor\nend.  All other truths depend on this Truth, as all other loves\ndepend on this love, and all other grandeurs on this grandeur.\nI understood it all, notwithstanding that my words are obscure in\ncomparison with that distinctness with which it pleased our Lord\nto show it to me.  What think you must be the power of His\nMajesty, seeing that in so short a time it leaves so great a\nblessing and such an impression on the soul?  O Grandeur!\nMajesty of mine! what is it Thou art doing, O my Lord Almighty!\nConsider who it is to whom Thou givest blessings so great!  Dost\nThou not remember that this my soul has been an abyss of lies and\na sea of vanities, and all my fault?  Though Thou hadst given me\na natural hatred of lying yet I did involve myself in many lying\nways.  How is this, O my God? how can it be that mercies and\ngraces so great should fall to the lot of one who has so ill\ndeserved them at Thy hands?\n8. Once, when I was with the whole community reciting the Office,\nmy soul became suddenly recollected, and seemed to me all bright\nas a mirror, clear behind, sideways, upwards, and downwards; and\nin the centre of it I saw Christ our Lord, as I usually see Him.\nIt seemed to me that I saw Him distinctly in every part of my\nsoul, as in a mirror, and at the same time the mirror was all\nsculptured--I cannot explain it--in our Lord Himself by a most\nloving communication which I can never describe.  I know that\nthis vision was a great blessing to me, and is still whenever I\nremember it, particularly after Communion.\n9. I understood by it, that, when a soul is in mortal sin, this\nmirror becomes clouded with a thick vapour, and utterly obscured,\nso that our Lord is neither visible nor present, though He is\nalways present in the conservation of its being.  In heretics,\nthe mirror is, as it were, broken in pieces, and that is worse\nthan being dimmed.  There is a very great difference between\nseeing this and describing it, for it can hardly be explained.\nBut it has done me great good; it has also made me very sorry on\naccount of those times when I dimmed the lustre of my soul by my\nsins, so that I could not see our Lord.\n10. This vision seems to me very profitable to recollected\npersons, to teach them to look upon our Lord as being in the\ninnermost part of their soul.  It is a method of looking upon Him\nwhich penetrates us more thoroughly, and is much more fruitful,\nthan that of looking upon Him as external to us, as I have said\nelsewhere, [4] and as it is laid down in books on prayer, where\nthey speak of where we are to seek God.  The glorious\nSt. Augustin, [5] in particular, says so, when he says that\nneither in the streets of the city, nor in pleasures, nor in any\nplace whatever where he sought Him, did he find Him as he found\nHim within himself.  This is clearly the best way; we need not go\nup to heaven, nor any further than our own selves, for that would\nonly distress the spirit and distract the soul, and bring but\nlittle fruit.\n11. I should like to point out one result of a deep trance; it\nmay be that some are aware of it.  When the time is over during\nwhich the soul was in union, wherein all its powers were wholly\nabsorbed,--it lasts, as I have said, [6] but a moment,--the soul\ncontinues still to be recollected, unable to recover itself even\nin outward things; for the two powers--the memory and the\nunderstanding--are, as it were, in a frenzy, extremely\ndisordered.  This, I say, happens occasionally, particularly in\nthe beginnings.  I am thinking whether it does not result from\nthis: that our natural weakness cannot endure the vehemence of\nthe spirit, which is so great, and that the imagination is\nenfeebled.  I know it to be so with some.  I think it best for\nthese to force themselves to give up prayer at that time, and\nresume it afterwards, when they may recover what they have lost,\nand not do everything at once, for in that case much harm might\ncome of it.  I know this by experience, as well as the necessity\nof considering what our health can bear.\n12. Experience is necessary throughout, so also is a spiritual\ndirector; for when the soul has reached this point, there are\nmany matters which must be referred to the director.  If, after\nseeking such a one, the soul cannot find him, our Lord will not\nfail that soul, seeing that He has not failed me, who am what I\nam: They are not many, I believe, who know by experience so many\nthings, and without experience it is useless to treat a soul at\nall, for nothing will come of it, save only trouble and distress.\nBut our Lord will take this also into account, and for that\nreason it is always best to refer the matter to the director.\nI have already more than once said this, [7] and even all I am\nsaying now, only I do not distinctly remember it; but I do see\nthat it is of great importance, particularly to women, that they\nshould go to their confessor, and that he should be a man of\nexperience herein.  There are many more women than men to whom\nour Lord gives these graces; I have heard the holy friar Peter of\nAlcantara say so, and, indeed, I know it myself.  He used to say\nthat women made greater progress in this way than men did; and he\ngave excellent reasons for his opinion, all in favour of women;\nbut there is no necessity for repeating them here.\n13. Once, when in prayer, I had a vision, for a moment,--I saw\nnothing distinctly, but the vision was most clear,--how all\nthings are seen in God and how all things are comprehended in\nHim.  I cannot in any way explain it, but the vision remains most\ndeeply impressed on my soul, and is one of those grand graces\nwhich our Lord wrought in me, and one of those which put me to\nthe greatest shame and confusion whenever I call my sins to\nremembrance.  I believe, if it had pleased our Lord that I had\nseen this at an earlier time, or if they saw it who sin against\nHim, we should have neither the heart nor the daring to do so.\nI had the vision, I repeat it, but I cannot say that I saw\nanything; however, I must have seen something, seeing that I\nexplain it by an illustration, only it must have been in a way so\nsubtile and delicate that the understanding is unable to reach\nit, or I am so ignorant in all that relates to these visions,\nwhich seem to be not imaginary.  In some of these visions there\nmust be something imaginary, only, as the powers of the soul are\nthen in a trance, they are not able afterwards to retain the\nforms, as our Lord showed them to it then, and as He would have\nit rejoice in them.\n14. Let us suppose the Godhead to be a most brilliant diamond,\nmuch larger than the whole world, or a mirror like that to which\nI compared the soul in a former vision, [8] only in a way so high\nthat I cannot possibly describe it; and that all our actions are\nseen in that diamond, which is of such dimensions as to include\neverything, because nothing can be beyond it.  It was a fearful\nthing for me to see, in so short a time, so many things together\nin that brilliant diamond, and a most piteous thing too, whenever\nI think of it, to see such foul things as my sins present in the\npure brilliancy of that light.\n15. So it is, whenever I remember it, I do not know how to bear\nit, and I was then so ashamed of myself that I knew not where to\nhide myself.  Oh, that some one could make this plain to those\nwho commit most foul and filthy sins, that they may remember\ntheir sins are not secret, and that God most justly resents them,\nseeing that they are wrought in the very presence of His Majesty,\nand that we are demeaning ourselves so irreverently before Him!\nI saw, too, how completely hell is deserved for only one mortal\nsin, and how impossible it is to understand the exceeding great\nwickedness of committing it in the sight of majesty so great, and\nhow abhorrent to His nature such actions are.  In this we see\nmore and more of His mercifulness, who, though we all know His\nhatred of sin, yet suffers us to live.\n16. The vision made me also reflect, that if one such vision as\nthis fills the souls with such awe, what will it be in the day of\njudgment, when His Majesty will appear distinctly, and when we\ntoo shall look on the sins we have committed!  O my God, I have\nbeen, oh, how blind!  I have often been amazed at what I have\nwritten; and you, my father, be you not amazed at anything, but\nthat I am still living,--I, who see such things, and know myself\nto be what I am.  Blessed for ever be He who has borne with me\nso long!\n17. Once, in prayer, with much recollection, sweetness, and\nrepose, I saw myself, as it seemed to me, surrounded by angels,\nand was close unto God.  I began to intercede with His Majesty on\nbehalf of the church.  I was given to understand the great\nservices which a particular Order would render in the latter\ndays, and the courage with which its members would maintain\nthe faith.\n18. I was praying before the most Holy Sacrament one day; I had a\nvision of a Saint, whose Order was in some degree fallen. In his\nhands he held a large book, which he opened, and then told me to\nread certain words, written in large and very legible letters;\nthey were to this effect: \"In times to come this Order will\nflourish; it will have many martyrs.\" [9]\n19. On another occasion, when I was at Matins in choir, six or\nseven persons, who seemed to me to be of this Order, appeared and\nstood before me with swords in their hands.  The meaning of that,\nas I think, is that they are to be defenders of the faith; for at\nanother time, when I was in prayer, I fell into a trance, and\nstood in spirit on a wide plain, where many persons were\nfighting; and the members of this Order were fighting with great\nzeal.  Their faces were beautiful, and as it were on fire.\nMany they laid low on the ground defeated, others they killed.\nIt seemed to me to be a battle with heretics.\n20. I have seen this glorious Saint occasionally, and he has told\nme certain things, and thanked me for praying for his Order, and\nhe has promised to pray for me to our Lord.  I do not say which\nOrders these are,--our Lord, if it so pleased Him, could make\nthem known,--lest the others should be aggrieved.  Let every\nOrder, or every member of them by himself, labour, that by his\nmeans our Lord would so bless his own Order that it may serve Him\nin the present grave necessities of His Church.  Blessed are they\nwhose lives are so spent.\n21. I was once asked by a person to pray God to let him know\nwhether his acceptance of a bishopric would be for the service of\nGod.  After Communion our Lord said to me: \"When he shall have\nclearly and really understood that true dominion consists in\npossessing nothing, he may then accept it.\"  I understood by this\nthat he who is to be in dignity must be very far from wishing or\ndesiring it, or at least he must not seek it.\n22. These and many other graces our Lord has given, and is giving\ncontinually, to me a sinner.  I do not think it is necessary to\nspeak of them, because the state of my soul can be ascertained\nfrom what I have written; so also can the spirit which our Lord\nhas given me.  May He be blessed for ever, who has been so\nmindful of me!\n23. Our Lord said to me once, consoling me, that I was not to\ndistress myself,--this He said most lovingly,--because in this\nlife we could not continue in the same state. [10]  At one time I\nshould be fervent, at another not; now disquieted, and again at\npeace, and tempted; but I must hope in Him, and fear not.\n24. I was one day thinking whether it was a want of detachment in\nme to take pleasure in the company of those who had the care of\nmy soul, and to have an affection for them, and to comfort myself\nwith those whom I see to be very great servants of God. [11]\nOur Lord said to me: \"It is not a virtue in a sick man to abstain\nfrom thanking and loving the physician who seems to restore him\nto health when he is in danger of death.  What should I have done\nwithout these persons?  The conversation of good people was never\nhurtful; my words should always be weighed, and holy; and I was\nnot to cease my relations with them, for they would do me good\nrather than harm.\"\n25. This was a great comfort to me, because, now and then, I\nwished to abstain from converse with all people; for it seemed to\nme that I was attached to them.  Always, in all things, did our\nLord console me, even to the showing me how I was to treat those\nwho were weak, and some other people also.  Never did He cease to\ntake care of me.  I am sometimes distressed to see how little I\ndo in His service, and how I am forced to spend time in taking\ncare of a body so weak and worthless as mine is, more than\nI wish.\n26. I was in prayer one night, when it was time to go to sleep.\nI was in very great pain, and my usual sickness was coming\non. [12]  I saw myself so great a slave to myself, and, on the\nother hand, the spirit asked for time for itself.  I was so much\ndistressed that I began to weep exceedingly, and to be very\nsorry.  This has happened to me not once only, but, as I am\nsaying, very often; and it seems to make me weary of myself, so\nthat at the time I hold myself literally in abhorrence.\nHabitually, however, I know that I do not hate myself, and I\nnever fail to take that which I see to be necessary for me.\nMay our Lord grant that I do not take more than is necessary!--I\nam afraid I do.\n27. When I was thus distressed, our Lord appeared unto me.\nHe comforted me greatly, and told me I must do this for His love,\nand bear it; my life was necessary now.  And so, I believe, I\nhave never known real pain since I resolved to serve my Lord and\nmy Consoler with all my strength; for though he would leave me to\nsuffer a little, yet He would console me in such a way that I am\ndoing nothing when I long for troubles.  And it seems to me there\nis nothing worth living for but this, and suffering is what I\nmost heartily pray to God for.  I say to Him sometimes, with my\nwhole heart: \"O Lord, either to die or to suffer!  I ask of Thee\nnothing else for myself.\"  It is a comfort to me to hear the\nclock strike, because I seem to have come a little nearer to the\nvision of God, in that another hour of my life has passed away.\n28. At other times I am in such a state that I do not feel that I\nam living, nor yet do I desire to die but I am lukewarm, and\ndarkness surrounds me on every side, as I said before; [13] for I\nam very often in great trouble.  It pleased our Lord that the\ngraces He wrought in me should be published abroad, [14] as He\ntold me some years ago they should be.  It was a great pain to\nme, and I have borne much on that account even to this day, as\nyou, my father, know, because every man explains them in his own\nsense.  But my comfort herein is that it is not my fault that\nthey are become known, for I was extremely cautious never to\nspeak of them but to my confessors, or to persons who I knew had\nheard of them from them.  I was silent, however, not out of\nhumility, but because, as I said before, [15] it gave me great\npain to speak of them even to my confessors.\n29. Now, however,--to God be the glory!--though many speak\nagainst me, but out of a zeal for goodness, and though some are\nafraid to speak to me, and even to hear my confession, and though\nothers have much to say about me, because I see that our Lord\nwilled by this means to provide help for many souls,--and also\nbecause I see clearly and keep in mind how much He would suffer,\nif only for the gaining of one,--I do not care about it at all.\n30. I know not why it is so, but perhaps the reason may in some\nmeasure be that His Majesty has placed me in this corner out of\nthe way, where the enclosure is so strict, and where I am as one\nthat is dead.  I thought that no one would remember me, but I am\nnot so much forgotten as I wish I was, for I am forced to speak\nto some people.  But as I am in a house where none may see me, it\nseems as if our Lord had been pleased to bring me to a haven,\nwhich I trust in His Majesty will be secure.  Now that I am out\nof the world, with companions holy and few in number, I look down\non the world as from a great height, and care very little what\npeople say or know about me.  I think much more of one soul's\nadvancement, even if it were but slight, than of all that people\nmay say of me; and since I am settled here it has pleased our\nLord that all my desires tend to this.\n31. He has made my life to me now a kind of sleep; for almost\nalways what I see seems to me to be seen as in a dream, nor have\nI any great sense either of pleasure or of pain.  If matters\noccur which may occasion either, the sense of it passes away so\nquickly that it astonishes me, and leaves an impression as if I\nhad been dreaming,--and this is the simple truth; for if I wished\nafterwards to delight in that pleasure, or be sorry over that\npain, it is not in my power to do so: just as a sensible person\nfeels neither pain nor pleasure in the memory of a dream that is\npast; for now our Lord has roused my soul out of that state\nwhich, because I was not mortified nor dead to the things of this\nworld, made me feel as I did, and His Majesty does not wish me to\nbecome blind again.\n32. This is the way I live now, my lord and father; do you, my\nfather, pray to God that He would take me to Himself, or enable\nme to serve Him.  May it please His Majesty that what I have\nwritten may be of some use to you, my father!  I have so little\ntime, [16] and therefore my trouble has been great in writing;\nbut it will be a blessed trouble if I have succeeded in saying\nanything that will cause one single act of praise to our Lord.\nIf that were the case, I should look upon myself as sufficiently\nrewarded, even if you, my father, burnt at once what I have\nwritten.  I would rather it were not burnt before those three saw\nit, whom you, my father, know of, because they are, and have\nbeen, my confessors; for if it be bad, it is right they should\nlose the good opinion they have of me; and if it be good, they\nare good and learned men, and I know they will recognise its\nsource, and give praise to Him who hath spoken through me.\n33. May His Majesty ever be your protector, and make you so great\na saint that your spirit and light may show the way to me a\nmiserable creature, so wanting in humility and so bold as to have\nventured to write on subjects so high!  May our Lord grant I have\nnot fallen into any errors in the matter, for I had the intention\nand the desire to be accurate and obedient, and also that through\nme He might, in some measure, have glory,--because that is what I\nhave been praying for these many years; and as my good works are\ninefficient for that end, I have ventured to put in order this my\ndisordered life.  Still, I have not wasted more time, nor given\nit more attention, than was necessary for writing it; yet I have\nput down all that has happened to me with all the simplicity and\nsincerity possible.\n34. May our Lord, who is all-powerful, grant--and He can if He\nwill--that I may attain to the doing of His will in all things!\nMay He never suffer this soul to be lost, which He so often, in\nso many ways, and by so many means, has rescued from hell and\ndrawn unto Himself!  Amen.\nI.H.S.\nThe Holy Spirit be ever with you, my father. [17]  Amen.\nIt would not be anything improper if I were to magnify my labour\nin writing this, to oblige you to be very careful to recommend me\nto our Lord; for indeed I may well do so, considering what I have\ngone through in giving this account of myself, and in retracing\nmy manifold wretchedness.  But, still, I can say with truth that\nI felt it more difficult to speak of the graces which I have\nreceived from our Lord than to speak of my offences against His\nMajesty.  You, my father, commanded me to write at length; that\nis what I have done, on condition that you will do what you\npromised, namely, destroy everything in it that has the\nappearance of being wrong.  I had not yet read it through after I\nhad written it, when your reverence sent for it.  Some things in\nit may not be very clearly explained, and there may be some\nrepetitions; for the time I could give to it was so short, that I\ncould not stop to see what I was writing.  I entreat your\nreverence to correct it and have it copied, if it is to be sent\non to the Father-Master, Avila, [18] for perhaps some one may\nrecognise the handwriting.  I wish very much you would order it\nso that he might see it, for I began to write it with a view to\nthat I shall be greatly comforted if he shall think that I am on\na safe road, now that, so far as it concerns me, there is nothing\nmore to be done.\nYour reverence will do in all things that which to you shall seem\ngood, and you will look upon yourself as under an obligation to\ntake care of one who trusts her soul to your keeping.  I will\npray for the soul of your reverence to our Lord, so long as I\nlive.  You will, therefore, be diligent in His service, in order\nthat you may be able to help me; for your reverence will see by\nwhat I have written how profitable it is to give oneself, as your\nreverence has begun to do, wholly unto Him who gives Himself to\nus so utterly without measure.\nBlessed be His Majesty for ever!  I hope of His mercy we shall\nsee one another one day, when we, your reverence and myself,\nshall see more clearly the great mercies He has shown us, and\nwhen we shall praise Him for ever and ever.  Amen.  This book was\nfinished in June, 1562.\n\"This date refers to the first account which the holy Mother\nTeresa of Jesus wrote of her life; it was not then divided into\nchapters.

Yepez says that the Order here spoken of is the Carmelite, and\nRibera understands the Saint to refer to that of St. Dominic.\nThe Bollandists, n. 1638-1646, on the whole, prefer the authority\nof Ribera to that of Yepez and give good reasons for their\npreference, setting aside as insufficient the testimony of Fray\nLuis of the Assumption, who says he heard himself from the\nVenerable Anne of St. Bartholomew that the Order in question is\nthe Order of our Lady of Mount Carmel.  Don Vicente, the Spanish\neditor, rejects the opinion of Ribera, on the ground that it\ncould not have been truly said of the Dominicans in the sixteenth\ncentury that the Order was in \"some degree fallen,\" for it was in\na most flourishing state.  He therefore was inclined to believe\nthat the Saint referred to the Augustinians or to the\nFranciscans.  But, after he had printed this part of his book, he\ndiscovered among the MSS. in the public library of Madrid a\nletter of Anne of St. Bartholomew, addressed to Fray Luis of the\nAssumption, in which the saintly companion of St. Teresa says\nthat the \"Order was ours.\"  Don Vicente has published the letter\nin the Appendix, p.\u00a0566.\n10.

[1]\n1. The method of prayer I observe at present is this: when I am\nin prayer, it is very rarely that I can use the understanding,\nbecause the soul becomes at once recollected, remains in repose,\nor falls into a trance, so that I cannot in any way have the use\nof the faculties and the senses,--so much so, that the hearing\nalone is left; but then it does not help me to\nunderstand anything.\n2. It often happens, when I am not even thinking of the things of\nGod, but engaged in other matters, and when prayer seems to be\nbeyond my power, whatever efforts I might make, because of the\ngreat aridity I am in, bodily pains contributing thereto, that\nthis recollection or elevation of spirit comes upon me so\nsuddenly that I cannot withstand it, and the fruits and blessings\nit brings with it are in a moment mine: and this, without my\nhaving had a vision, or heard anything, or knowing where I am,\nexcept that when the soul seems to be lost I see it make great\nprogress, which I could not have made if I had laboured for a\nwhole year, so great is my gain.\n3. At other times certain excessive impetuosities occur,\naccompanied with a certain fainting away of the soul for God, so\nthat I have no control over myself; [2] my life seems to have\ncome to an end, and so it makes me cry out and call upon God; and\nthis comes upon me with great vehemence.  Sometimes I cannot\nremain sitting, so great is the oppression of the heart; and this\npain comes on without my doing anything to cause it, and the\nnature of it is such that my soul would be glad never to be\nwithout it while I live.  And the longings I have are longings\nnot to live; and they come on because it seems as if I must live\non without being able to find any relief, for relief comes from\nthe vision of God, which comes by death, and death is what I\ncannot take; and with all this my soul thinks that all except\nitself are filled with consolations, and that all find help in\ntheir troubles, but not itself.  The distress thus occasioned is\nso intense that, if our Lord did not relieve it by throwing it\ninto a trance, whereby all is made calm, and the soul rests in\ngreat quiet and is satisfied, now by seeing something of that\nwhich it desires, now by hearing other things, it would seem to\nbe impossible for it to be delivered from this pain.\n4. At other times there come upon me certain desires to serve\nGod, with a vehemence so great that I cannot describe it, and\naccompanied with a certain pain at seeing how unprofitable I am.\nIt seems to me then that there is nothing in the world, neither\ndeath, nor martyrdom, that I could not easily endure.\nThis conviction, too, is not the result of any reflection, but\ncomes in a moment.  I am wholly changed, and I know not whence\ncometh such great courage.  I think I should live to raise my\nvoice, and publish to all the world how important it is for men\nnot to be satisfied with the common way, and how great the good\nis that God will give us if we prepare ourselves to receive it.\nI say it again, these desires are such that I am melted away in\nmyself, for I seem to desire what I cannot have.  The body seems\nto me to hold me in prison, through its inability to serve God\nand my state [3] in anything; for if it were not for the body, I\nmight do very great things, so far as my strength would allow;\nand thus, because I see myself without any power whatever to\nserve God, I feel this pain in a way wholly indescribable; the\nissue is delight, recollection, and the consolation of God.\n5. Again, it has happened, when these longings to serve Him come\nupon me, that I wish to do penance, but I am not able.  It would\nbe a great relief to me, and it does relieve and cheer me, though\nwhat I do is almost nothing, because of my bodily weakness; and\nyet, if I were to give way to these my longings, I believe I\nshould observe no moderation.\n6. Sometimes, if I have to speak to any one, I am greatly\ndistressed, and I suffer so much that it makes me weep\nabundantly; for my whole desire is to be alone, and solitude\ncomforts me, though at times I neither pray nor read, and\nconversation--particularly of kindred and connections--seems\noppressive, and myself to be as a slave, except when I speak to\nthose whose conversation is of prayer and matters of the\nsoul,--in these I find comfort and joy; [4] yet these\noccasionally are too much for me, and I would rather not see\nthem, but go where I might be alone: though this is not often the\ncase, for those especially who direct my conscience always\nconsole me.\n7. At other times it gives me much pain that I must eat and\nsleep, and that I see I cannot forego these things, being less\nable to do so than any one.  I submit that I may serve God, and\nthus I offer up those actions to him.  Time seems to me too\nshort, and that I have not enough for my prayer, for I should\nnever be tired of being alone.  I am always wishing I had time\nfor reading, for I have been always fond of reading.  I read very\nlittle, for when I take up a book I become recollected through\nthe pleasure it gives me, and thus my reading is turned into\nprayer: and it is but rarely, for I have many occupations; and\nthough they are good, they do not give me the pleasure which\nreading would give.  And thus I am always wishing for more time,\nand everything becomes disagreeable, so I believe, because I see\nI cannot do what I wish and desire.\n8. All these desires, with an increase in virtue, have been given\nme by our Lord since He raised me to this prayer of quiet, and\nsent these raptures.  I find myself so improved that I look on\nmyself as being a mass of perdition before this.  These raptures\nand visions leave me in possession of the blessings I shall now\nspeak of; and I maintain that, if there be any good in me, they\nare the occasions of it.\n9. I have made a very strong resolution never to offend God, not\neven venially.  I would rather die a thousand deaths than do\nanything of the kind knowingly.  I am resolved never to leave\nundone anything I may consider to be the more perfect, or more\nfor the honour of our Lord, if he who has the care of my soul and\ndirects me tells me I may do it.  Cost me what pain it might, I\nwould not leave such an act undone for all the treasure of the\nworld.  If I were to do so, I do not think I could have the face\nto ask anything of God our Lord, or to make my prayer; and yet,\nfor all this, I have many faults and imperfections.  I am\nobedient to my confessor, [5] though imperfectly; but if I know\nthat he wishes or commands anything, I would not leave that\nundone, so far as I understand it; if I did so, I should think\nmyself under a grievous delusion.\n10. I have a longing for poverty, though not free from\nimperfection; however, I believe, if I had wealth, I would not\nreserve any revenue, nor hoard money for myself, nor do I care\nfor it; I wish to have only what is necessary.  Nevertheless, I\nfeel that I am very defective in this virtue; for, though I\ndesire nothing for myself, I should like to have something to\ngive away: still, I desire no revenue, nor anything\nfor myself. [6]\n11. In almost all the visions I have had, I have found good, if\nit be not a delusion of Satan; herein I submit myself to the\njudgment of my confessors.\n12. As to fine and beautiful things, such as water, fields,\nperfume, music, etc., I think I would rather not have them, so\ngreat is the difference between them and what I am in the habit\nof seeing, and so all pleasure in them is gone from me. [7]\nHence it is that I care not for them, unless it be at the first\nsight: they never make any further impression; to me they seem\nbut dirt.\n13. If I speak or converse with people in the world--for I cannot\nhelp it--even about prayer, and if the conversation be long,\nthough to pass away the time, I am under great constraint if it\nbe not necessary, for it gives me much pain.\n14. Amusements, of which I used to be fond, and worldly things,\nare all disagreeable to me now, and I cannot look at them.\n15. The longings, which I said I have, [8] of loving and serving\nand seeing God, are not helped by any reflections, as formerly,\nwhen I thought I was very devout, and shed many tears; but they\nflow out of a certain fire and heat so excessive that, I repeat\nit, if God did not relieve them by throwing me into a trance,\nwherein the soul seems to find itself satisfied, I believe my\nlife would come to an end at once.\n16. When I see persons making great progress, and thus resolved,\ndetached, and courageous, I love them much; and I should like to\nhave my conversation with such persons, and I think they help me\non.  People who are afraid, and seemingly cautious in those\nthings, the doing of which is perfectly reasonable here, seem to\nvex me, and drive me to pray to God and the saints to make them\nundertake such things as these which now frighten us.  Not that I\nam good for anything myself, but because I believe that God helps\nthose who, for His sake, apply themselves to great things, and\nthat He never abandons any one who puts his trust in Him only.\nAnd I should like to find any one who would help me to believe\nso, and to be without thought about food and raiment, but leave\nit all in the hands of God. [9]\n17. This leaving in the hands of God the supply of all I need is\nnot to be understood as excluding all labour on my part, but\nmerely solicitude--I mean, the solicitude of care.  And since I\nhave attained to this liberty, it goes well with me, and I labour\nto forget myself as much as I can.  I do not think it is a year\nago since our Lord gave me this liberty.\n18. Vainglory [10]--glory, be to God!--so far as I know, there is\nno reason why I should have any; for I see plainly that in these\nthings which God sends me I have no part myself; on the contrary,\nGod makes me conscious of my own wretchedness; for whatever\nreflections I might be able to make, I could never come to the\nknowledge of such deep truths as I attain to in a single rapture.\n19. When I speak of these things a few days after, they seem to\nme as if they had happened to another person.  Previously, I\nthought it a wrong to me that they should be known to others; but\nI see now that I am not therefore any the better, but rather\nworse, seeing that I make so little progress after receiving\nmercies so great.  And certainly, in every way, it seems to me\nthat there was not in the world anybody worse than myself; and so\nthe virtues of others seem to me much more meritorious than mine,\nand that I do nothing myself but receive graces, and that God\nmust give to others at once all that He is now giving unto me;\nand I pray Him not to reward me in this life; and so I believe\nthat God has led me along this way because I am weak and wicked.\n20. When I am in prayer, and even almost always when I am able to\nreflect at all, I cannot, even if I tried, pray to God for rest,\nor desire it; for I see that His life was one of suffering, and\nthat I ask Him to send me, giving me first the grace to bear it.\n21. Everything of this kind, and of the highest perfection, seems\nto make so deep an impression on me in prayer, that I am amazed\nat the sight of truths so great and so clear that the things of\nthe world seem to be folly; and so it is necessary for me to take\npains to reflect on the way I demeaned myself formerly in the\nthings of the world, for it seems to me folly to feel for deaths\nand the troubles of the world,--at least, that sorrow for, or\nlove of, kindred and friends should last long.  I say I have to\ntake pains when I am considering what I was, and what I used to\nfeel.\n22. If I see people do anything which clearly seems to be sin, I\ncannot make up my mind that they have offended God; and if I\ndwell upon this at all,--which happens rarely or never,--I never\ncan make up my mind, though I see it plainly enough.  It seems to\nme that everybody is as anxious to serve God as I am.  And herein\nGod has been very gracious unto me, for I never dwell on an evil\ndeed, to remember it afterwards and if I do remember it, I see\nsome virtue or other in that person.  In this way these things\nnever weary me, except generally: but heresies do; they distress\nme very often, and almost always when I think of them they seem\nto me to be the only trouble which should be felt.  And also I\nfeel, when I see people who used to give themselves to prayer\nfall away; this gives me pain, but not much, because I strive not\nto dwell upon it.\n23. I find, also, that I am improved in the matter of that\nexcessive neatness which I was wont to observe, [11] though not\nwholly delivered from it.  I do not discern that I am always\nmortified in this; sometimes, however, I do.\n24. All this I have described, together with a very constant\ndwelling in thought on God, is the ordinary state of my soul, so\nfar as I can understand it.  And if I must be busy about\nsomething else, without my seeking it, as I said before, [12] I\nknow not who makes me awake,--and this not always, only when I am\nbusy with things of importance; and such--glory be to God!--only\nat intervals demand my attention, and do not occupy me at\nall times.\n25. For some days--they are not many, however--for three, or\nfour, or five, all my good and fervent thoughts, and my visions,\nseem to be withdrawn, yea, even forgotten, so that, if I were to\nseek for it, I know of no good that can ever have been in me.  It\nseems to have been all a dream, or, at least, I can call nothing\nto mind.  Bodily pains at the same time distress me.\nMy understanding is troubled, so that I cannot think at all about\nGod, neither do I know under what law I live.  If I read\nanything, I do not understand it; I seem to be full of faults,\nand without any resolution whatever to practise virtue; and the\ngreat resolution I used to have is come to this, that I seem to\nbe unable to resist the least temptation or slander of the world.\nIt suggests itself to me then that I am good for nothing, if any\none would have me undertake more than the common duties.  I give\nway to sadness, thinking I have deceived all those who trusted me\nat all.  I should like to hide myself where nobody could see me;\nbut my desire for solitude arises from want of courage, not from\nlove of virtue.  It seems to me that I should like to dispute\nwith all who contradict me; I am under the influence of these\nimpressions, only God has been so gracious unto me, that I do not\noffend more frequently than I was wont to do, nor do I ask Him to\ndeliver me from them, but only, if it be His will I should always\nsuffer thus, to keep me from offending Him; and I submit myself\nto His will with my whole heart, and I see that it is a very\ngreat grace bestowed upon me that He does not keep me constantly\nin this state.\n26. One thing astonishes me; it is that, while I am in this\nstate, through a single word of those I am in the habit of\nhearing, or a single vision, or a little self-recollection,\nlasting but an Ave Maria, or through my drawing near to\ncommunicate, I find my soul and body so calm, so sound, the\nunderstanding so clear, and myself possessing all the strength\nand all the good desires I usually have.  And this I have had\nexperience of very often--at least when I go to Communion; it is\nmore than six months ago that I felt a clear improvement in my\nbodily health, [13] and that occasionally brought about through\nraptures, and I find it last sometimes more than three hours, at\nother times I am much stronger for a whole day; and I do not\nthink it is fancy, for I have considered the matter, and\nreflected on it.  Accordingly, when I am thus recollected, I fear\nno illness.  The truth is, that when I pray, as I was accustomed\nto do before, I feel no improvement.\n27. All these things of which I am speaking make me believe that\nit comes from God; for when I see what I once was, that I was in\nthe way of being lost, and that soon, my soul certainly is\nastonished at these things, without knowing whence these virtues\ncame to me; I did not know myself, and saw that all was a gift,\nand not the fruit of my labours.  I understand in all\ntruthfulness and sincerity, and see that I am not deluded, that\nit has been not only the means of drawing me to God in His\nservice, but of saving me also from hell.  This my confessors\nknow, who have heard my general confession.\n28. Also, when I see any one who knows anything about me, I wish\nto let him know my whole life, [14] because my honour seems to me\nto consist in the honour of our Lord, and I care for nothing\nelse.  This He knows well, or I am very blind; for neither\nhonour, nor life, nor praise, nor good either of body or of soul,\ncan interest me, nor do I seek or desire any advantage, only His\nglory.  I cannot believe that Satan has sought so many means of\nmaking my soul advance, in order to lose it after all.  I do not\nhold him to be so foolish.  Nor can I believe it of God, though I\nhave deserved to fall into delusions because of my sins, that He\nhas left unheeded so many prayers of so many good people for two\nyears, and I do nothing else but ask everybody to pray to our\nLord that He would show me if this be for His glory, or lead me\nby another way. [15]  I do not believe that these things would\nhave been permitted by His Majesty to be always going on if they\nwere not His work.  These considerations, and the reasons of so\nmany saintly men, give me courage when I am under the pressure of\nfear that they are not from God, I being so wicked myself.\nBut when I am in prayer, and during those days when I am in\nrepose, and my thoughts fixed on God, if all the learned and holy\nmen in the world came together and put me to, all conceivable\ntortures, and I, too, desirous of agreeing with them, they could\nnot make me believe that this is the work of Satan, for I cannot.\nAnd when they would have had me believe it, I was afraid, seeing\nwho it was that said so; and I thought that they must be saying\nwhat was true, and that I, being what I was, must have been\ndeluded.  But all they had said to me was destroyed by the first\nword, or recollection, or vision that came, and I was able to\nresist no longer, and believed it was from God. [16]\n29. However, I can think that Satan now and then may intermeddle\nhere, and so it is, as I have seen and said; but he produces\ndifferent results, nor can he, as it seems to me, deceive any one\npossessed of any experience.  Nevertheless, I say that, though I\ndo certainly believe this to be from God, I would never do\nanything, for any consideration whatever, that is not judged by\nhim who has the charge of my soul to be for the better service of\nour Lord, and I never had any intention but to obey without\nconcealing anything, for that is my duty.  I am very often\nrebuked for my faults, and that in such a way as to pierce me to\nthe very quick; and I am warned when there is, or when there may\nbe, any danger in what I am doing.  These rebukes and warnings\nhave done me much good, in often reminding me of my former sins,\nwhich make me exceedingly sorry.\n30. I have been very long, but this is the truth,--that, when I\nrise from my prayer, I see that I have received blessings which\nseem too briefly described.  Afterwards I fall into many\nimperfections, and am unprofitable and very wicked.  And perhaps\nI have no perception of what is good, but am deluded; still, the\ndifference in my life is notorious, and compels me to think over\nall I have said--I mean, that which I verily believe I have felt.\nThese are the perfections which I feel our Lord has wrought in\nme, who am so wicked and so imperfect.  I refer it all to your\njudgment, my father, for you know the whole state of my soul.\n1. Fra Anton. a Sancto Joseph, in his notes on this Relation,\nusually published among the letters of the Saint, ed. Doblado,\nvol. ii. letter 11, says it was written for St. Peter of\nAlcantara when he came to Avila in 1560, at the time when the\nSaint was so severely tried by her confessors and the others who\nexamined her spirit, and were convinced that her prayer was a\ndelusion of Satan: see the Life, ch. xxv. \u00a7 18.  The following\nnotes were discovered among the papers of the Saint in the\nmonastery of the Incarnation, and are supposed to refer to this\nRelation.  The Chronicler of the Order, Fra Francis a Sancta\nMaria, is inclined to the belief that they were written by\nSt. Peter of Alcantara, to whom the Relation is addressed, and\nthe more so because Ribera does not claim them for any member of\nthe Society, notwithstanding the reference to them in \u00a7\u00a7 22,\u00a028.\n\"1. The end God has in view is the drawing a soul to himself;\nthat of the devil is the withdrawing it from God.  Our Lord never\ndoes anything whereby anyone may be separated from Him, and the\ndevil does nothing whereby any one may be made to draw near unto\nGod.  All the visions and the other operations in the soul of\nthis person draw her nearer unto God, and make her more humble\nand\u00a0obedient.\n\"2. It is the teaching of St. Thomas that an angel of light may\nbe recognised by the peace and quietness he leaves in the soul.\nShe is never visited in this way, but she afterwards abides in\npeace and joy; so much so, that all the pleasures of earth\ntogether are not comparable to one of these\u00a0visitations.\n\"3. She never commits a fault, nor falls into an imperfection,\nwithout being instantly rebuked by Him who speaks interiorly\nto\u00a0her.\n\"4. She has never prayed for nor wished for them: all she wishes\nfor is to do the will of God our Lord in all\u00a0things.\n\"5. Everything herein is consistent with the Scriptures and the\nteaching of the Church, and most true, according to the most\nrigorous principles of scholastic\u00a0theology.\n\"6. This soul is most pure and sincere, with the most fervent\ndesires of being pleasing unto God, and of trampling on every\nearthly\u00a0thing.\n\"7. She has been told that whatever she shall ask of God, being\ngood, she shall have.  She has asked much, and things not\nconvenient to put on paper lest it should be wearisome; all of\nwhich our Lord has\u00a0granted.\n\"8. When these operations are from God, they are always directed\nto the good of the recipient, to that of the community, or of\nsome other.  That she has profited by them she knows by\nexperience, and she knows it, too, of other persons\u00a0also.\n\"9. No one converses with her, if he be not in evil dispositions,\nwho is not moved thereby to devotion, even though she says\nnothing about\u00a0it.\n\"10. She is growing daily in the perfection of virtues, and\nlearns by these things the way of a higher perfection.  And thus,\nduring the whole time in which she had visions, she was making\nprogress, according to the doctrine of St.\u00a0Thomas.\n\"11. The spirit that speaks to her soul never tells her anything\nin the way of news, or what is unbecoming, but only that which\ntends to\u00a0edification.\n\"12. She has been told of some persons that they were full of\ndevils: but this was for the purpose of enabling her to\nunderstand the state of a soul which has sinned mortally against\nour\u00a0Lord.\n\"13. The devil's method is, when he attempts to deceive a soul,\nto advise that soul never to speak of what he says to it; but the\nspirit that speaks to this soul warns her to be open with learned\nmen, servants of our Lord, and that the devil may deceive her if\nshe should conceal anything through\u00a0shame.\n\"14. So great is the progress of her soul in this way, and the\nedification she ministers in the good example given, that more\nthan forty nuns in her monastery practise great\u00a0recollection.\n\"15. These supernatural things occur after long praying, when she\nis absorbed in God, on fire with His love, or at\u00a0Communion.\n\"16. They kindle in her a most earnest desire to be on the right\nroad, and to escape the delusions of\u00a0Satan.\n\"17. They are in her the cause of the deepest humility; she\nunderstands that what she receives comes to her from the hand of\nour Lord, and how little worth she is\u00a0herself.\n\"18. When they are withheld, anything that occurs is wont to pain\nand distress her; but when she is in this state, she remembers\nnothing; all she is conscious of is a great longing for\nsuffering, and so great is it that she is amazed at\u00a0it.\n\"19. They are to her sources of joy and consolation in her\ntroubles, when people speak ill of her, and in her\ninfirmities--and she has fearful pains about the heart,\nsicknesses, and many other afflictions, all of which leave her\nwhen she has these\u00a0visions.\n\"20. With all this, she undergoes great penances, fasting, the\ndiscipline, and\u00a0mortifications.\n\"21. All that on earth may give her any pleasure, and her trials,\nwhich are many, she bears with equal tranquillity of mind,\nwithout losing the peace and quiet of her\u00a0soul.\n\"22. Her resolution never to offend our Lord is so earnest that\nshe has made a vow never to leave undone what she knows herself,\nor is told by those who understand the matter better, to be the\nmore perfect.  And though she holds the members of the Society to\nbe saints, and believes that our Lord made use of them to bestow\non her graces so great, she told me that, if she knew it would be\nmore perfect to have nothing more to do with them, she would\nnever speak to them again, nor see them, notwithstanding the fact\nthat it was through them that her mind had been quieted and\ndirected in these\u00a0things.\n\"23. The sweetnesses she commonly receives, her sense of God, her\nlanguishing with love, are certainly marvellous, and through\nthese she is wont to be enraptured the whole day\u00a0long.\n\"24. She frequently falls into a trance when she hears God spoken\nof with devotion and earnestness, and cannot resist the rapture,\ndo what she can; and in that state her appearance is such that\nshe excites very great\u00a0devotion.\n\"25. She cannot bear to be directed by any one who will not tell\nher of her faults, and rebuke her; all that she accepts with\ngreat\u00a0humility.\n\"26. Moreover, she cannot endure people who are in a state of\nperfection, if they do not labour to become perfect, according to\nthe spirit of their\u00a0rule.\n\"27. She is most detached from her kindred, has no desire to\nconverse with people, and loves solitude.  She has a great\ndevotion to the saints, and on their feasts, and on the days on\nwhich the Church celebrates the mysteries of the faith, is filled\nwith most fervent affections for our\u00a0Lord.\n\"28. If all the members of the Society, and all the servants of\nGod upon earth, tell her that her state is an effect of the\noperations of Satan, or were to say so, she is in fear and\ntrembling before the visions occur; but as soon as she is in\nprayer, and recollected, she cannot be persuaded, were they to\ntear her into a thousand pieces, that it is any other than God\nwho is working in her and speaking to\u00a0her.\n\"29. God has given her a most wonderfully strong and valiant\nspirit: she was once timid; now she tramples on all the evil\nspirits.  She has put far away from herself all the littleness\nand silliness of women; she is singularly free from scruples, and\nmost\u00a0sincere.\n\"30. Besides, our Lord has given her the gift of most sweet\ntears, great compassion for her neighbours, the knowledge of her\nown faults, a great reverence for good people, and\nself-abasement; and I am certain that she has done good to many,\nof whom I am\u00a0one.\n\"31. She is continually reminding herself of God, and has a sense\nof His presence.  All the locutions have been verified, and every\none of them accomplished; and this is a very great\u00a0test.\n\"32. Her visions are a source of great clearness in her\nunderstanding, and an admirable illumination in the things\nof\u00a0God.\n\"33. It was said to her that she should lead those who were\ntrying her spirit to look into the Scriptures, and that they\nwould not find that any soul desirous of pleasing God had been so\nlong\u00a0deceived.\"\n2.

[1]\nJesus.\nI think it is more than a year since this was written; God has\nall this time protected me with His hand, so that I have not\nbecome worse; on the contrary, I see a great change for the\nbetter in all I have to say: may He be praised for it all!\n1. The visions and revelations have not ceased, but they are of a\nmuch higher kind.  Our Lord has taught me a way of prayer,\nwherein I find myself far more advanced, more detached from the\nthings of this life, more courageous, and more free. [2]  I fall\ninto a trance more frequently, for these ecstasies at times come\nupon me with great violence, and in such a way as to be outwardly\nvisible, I having no power to resist them; and even when I am\nwith others--for they come in such a way as admits of no\ndisguising them, unless it be by letting people suppose that, as\nI am subject to disease of the heart, they are fainting-fits; I\ntake great pains, however, to resist them when they are coming\non--sometimes I cannot do it.\n2. As to poverty, God seems to have wrought great things in me;\nfor I would willingly be without even what is necessary, unless\ngiven me as an alms; and therefore my longing is extreme that I\nmay be in such a state as to depend on alms alone for my food.\nIt seems to me that to live, when I am certain of food and\nraiment without fail, is not so complete an observance of my vow\nor of the counsel of Christ as it would be to live where no\nrevenue is possessed, and I should be in want at times; and as to\nthe blessings that come with true poverty, they seem to me to be\ngreat, and I would not miss them.  Many times do I find myself\nwith such great faith, that I do not think God will ever fail\nthose who serve Him, and without any doubt whatever that there\nis, or can be, any time in which His words are not fulfilled: I\ncannot persuade myself to the contrary, nor can I have any fear;\nand so, when they advise me to accept an endowment, I feel it\nkeenly, and betake myself unto God.\n3. I think I am much more compassionate towards the poor than I\nused to be, having a great pity for them and a desire to help\nthem; for if I regarded only my good will, I should give them\neven the habit I wear.  I am not fastidious with respect to them,\neven if I had to do with them or touched them with my hands,--and\nthis I now see is a gift of God; for though I used to give alms\nfor His love, I had no natural compassion.  I am conscious of a\ndistinct improvement herein.\n4. As to the evil speaking directed against me,--which is\nconsiderable, and highly injurious to me, and done by many,--I\nfind myself herein also very much the better.  I think that what\nthey say makes scarcely any more impression upon me than it would\nupon an idiot.  I think at times, and nearly always, that it is\njust.  I feel it so little that I see nothing in it that I might\noffer to God, as I learn by experience that my soul gains greatly\nthereby; on the contrary, the evil speaking seems to be a favour.\nAnd thus, the first time I go to prayer, I have no ill-feeling\nagainst them; the first time I hear it, it creates in me a little\nresistance, but it neither disturbs nor moves me; on the\ncontrary, when I see others occasionally disturbed, I am sorry\nfor them.  So it is, I put myself out of the question; for all\nthe wrongs of this life seem to me so light, that it is not\npossible to feel them, because I imagine myself to be dreaming,\nand see that all this will be nothing when I awake.\n5. God is giving me more earnest desires, a greater love of\nsolitude, a much greater detachment, as I said, with the visions;\nby these He has made me know what all that is, even if I gave up\nall the friends I have, both men and women and kindred.  This is\nthe least part of it: my kindred are rather a very great\nweariness to me; I leave them in all freedom and joy, provided it\nbe to render the least service unto God; and thus on every side I\nfind peace.\n6. Certain things, about which I have been warned in prayer, have\nbeen perfectly verified.  Thus, considering the graces received\nfrom God, I find myself very much better; but, considering my\nservice to Him in return, I am exceedingly worthless, for I have\nreceived greater consolation than I have given, though sometimes\nthat gives me grievous pain.  My penance is very scanty, the\nrespect shown me great, much against my own will very often. [3]\nHowever in a word, I see that I live an easy, not a penitential,\nlife; God help me, as He can!\n7. It is now nine months, more or less, since I wrote this with\nmine own hand; since then I have not turned my back on the graces\nwhich God has given me; I think I have received, so far as I can\nsee, a much greater liberty of late.  Hitherto I thought I had\nneed of others, and I had more reliance on worldly helps.  Now I\nclearly understand that all men are bunches of dried rosemary,\nand that there is no safety in leaning on them, for if they are\npressed by contradictions or evil speaking they break down.\nAnd so I know by experience that the only way not to fall is to\ncling to the cross, and put our trust in Him who was nailed\nthereto.  I find Him a real Friend, and with Him I find myself\nendowed with such might that, God never failing me, I think I\nshould be able to withstand the whole world if it were\nagainst me.\n8. Having a clear knowledge of this truth, I used to be very fond\nof being loved by others; now I do not care for that, yea,\nrather, their love seems to weary me in some measure, excepting\ntheirs who take care of my soul, or theirs to whom I think I do\ngood.  Of the former I wish to be loved, in order that they may\nbear with me; and of the latter, that they may be more inclined\nto believe me when I tell them that all is vanity.\n9. In the very grievous trials, persecutions, and contradictions\nof these months, [4] God gave me great courage; and the more\ngrievous they were, the greater the courage, without weariness in\nsuffering.  Not only had I no ill-feeling against those who spoke\nevil of me, but I had, I believe, conceived a deeper affection\nfor them.  I know not how it was; certainly it was a gift from\nthe hand of our Lord.\n10. When I desire anything, I am accustomed naturally to desire\nit with some vehemence; now my desires are so calm, that I do not\neven feel that I am pleased when I see them fulfilled. Sorrow and\njoy, excepting in that which relates to prayer, are so moderated,\nthat I seem to be without sense, and in that state I remain for\nsome days.\n11. The vehement longings to do penance which come, and have\ncome, upon me are great; and if I do any penance, I feel it to be\nso slight in comparison with that longing, that I regard it\nsometimes, and almost always, as a special consolation; however,\nI do but little, because of my great weakness.\n12. It is a very great pain to me very often, and at this moment\nmost grievous, that I must take food, particularly if I am in\nprayer.  It must be very great, for it makes me weep much, and\nspeak the language of affliction, almost without being aware of\nit, and that is what I am not in the habit of doing, for I do not\nremember that I ever did so in the very heaviest trials of my\nlife: I am not a woman in these things, for I have a hard heart.\n13. I feel in myself a very earnest desire, more so than usual,\nthat God may find those who will serve Him, particularly learned\nmen, in all detachment, and who will not cleave to anything of\nthis world, for I see it is all a mockery; for when I see the\ngreat needs of the Church, I look upon it as a mockery to be\ndistressed about aught else.  I do nothing but pray to God for\nsuch men, because I see that one person, who is wholly perfect in\nthe true fervour of the love of God, will do more good than many\nwho are lukewarm.\n14. In matters concerning the faith, my courage seems to me much\ngreater.  I think I could go forth alone by myself against the\nLutherans, and convince them of their errors.  I feel very keenly\nthe loss of so many souls.  I see many persons making great\nprogress; I see clearly it was the pleasure of God that such\nprogress should have been helped by me; and I perceive that my\nsoul, of His goodness, grows daily more and more in His love.\n15. I think I could not be led away by vainglory, even if I\nseriously tried, and I do not see how I could imagine any one of\nmy virtues to be mine, for it is not long since I was for many\nyears without any at all; and now so far as I am concerned, I do\nnothing but receive graces, without rendering any service in\nreturn, being the most worthless creature in the world.  And so\nit is that I consider at times how all, except myself, make\nprogress; I am good for nothing in myself.  This is not humility\nonly, but the simple truth; and the knowledge of my being so\nworthless makes me sometimes think with fear that I must be under\nsome delusion.  Thus I see clearly that all my gain has come\nthrough the revelations and the raptures, in which I am nothing\nmyself, and do no more to effect them than the canvas does for\nthe picture painted on it.  This makes me feel secure and be at\nrest; and I place myself in the hands of God, and trust my\ndesires; for I know for certain that my desires are to die for\nHim, and to lose all ease, and that whatever may happen.\n16. There are days wherein I remember times without number the\nwords of St. Paul, [5]--though certainly they are not true of\nme,--that I have neither life, nor speech, nor will of my own,\nbut that there is One in me by whom I am directed and made\nstrong; and I am, as it were, beside myself, and thus life is a\nvery grievous burden to me.  And the greatest oblation I make to\nGod, as the highest service on my part, is that I, when I feel it\nso painfully to be absent from Him, am willing to live on for the\nlove of Him.  I would have my life also full of great\ntribulations and persecutions; now that I am unprofitable, I\nshould like to suffer; and I would endure all the tribulations in\nthe world to gain ever so little more merit--I mean, by a more\nperfect doing of His will.\n17. Everything that I have learnt in prayer, though it may be two\nyears previously, I have seen fulfilled.  What I see and\nunderstand of the grandeurs of God, and of the way He has shown\nthem, is so high, that I scarcely ever begin to think of them but\nmy understanding fails me,--for I am as one that sees things far\nhigher than I can understand,--and I become recollected.\n18. God so keeps me from offending Him, that I am verily amazed\nat times.  I think I discern the great care He takes of me,\nwithout my taking scarcely any care at all, being as I was,\nbefore these things happened to me, a sea of wickedness and sins,\nand without a thought that I was mistress enough of myself to\nleave them undone.  And the reason why I would have this known is\nthat the great power of God might be made manifest.  Unto Him be\npraise for ever and ever!  Amen.\nJesus.\nThis Relation here set forth, not in my handwriting, is one that\nI gave to my confessor, and which he with his own hand copied,\nwithout adding or diminishing a word.  He was a most spiritual\nman and a theologian: I discussed the state of my soul with him,\nand he with other learned men, among whom was Father Mancio. [6]\nThey found nothing in it that is not in perfect agreement with\nthe holy writings.  This makes me calm now, though, while God is\nleading me by this way, I feel that it is necessary for me to put\nno trust whatever in myself.  And so I have always done, though\nit is painful enough.  You, my father, will be careful that all\nthis goes under the seal of confession, according to my request.\n1. Addressed, it is believed, to her confessor, F. Pedro Iba\u00f1ez.\nThis Relation corresponds with ch. xxxiv. of the Life (De\nla\u00a0Fuente).\n2. See Life, ch. xxvii.\n3. See Life, ch. xxxi. \u00a7 15.\n4. The Saint is supposed to refer to the troubles she endured\nduring the foundation of the monastery of St.\u00a0Joseph.\n5. Gal. ii. 20: \"Vivo autem, jam non ego; vivit vero in\nme\u00a0Christus.\"\n6. A celebrated Dominican, professor of theology in\nSalamanca\u00a0(Bouix).\nRelation III.\nOf Various Graces Granted to the Saint from the Year 1568 to\n1571 Inclusive.\n1. When I was in the monastery of Toledo, and some people were\nadvising me not to allow any but noble persons to be buried\nthere, [1] our Lord said to me: \"Thou wilt be very inconsistent,\nMy daughter, if thou regardest the laws of the world.  Look at\nMe, poor and despised of men: are the great people of the world\nlikely to be great in My eyes? or is it descent or virtue that is\nto make you esteemed?\"\n2. After Communion, the second day of Lent, in St. Joseph of\nMalagon, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me in an imaginary\nvision, as He is I wont to do; and when I was looking upon Him I\nsaw that He had on His head, instead of the crown of thorns, a\ncrown of great splendour, over the part where the wounds of that\ncrown must have been.  And as I have a great devotion to the\ncrowning with thorns, I was exceedingly consoled, and began to\nthink how great the pain must have been because of the many\nwounds, and to be sorrowful.  Our Lord told me not to be sad\nbecause of those wounds, but for the many wounds which men\ninflict upon Him now.  I asked Him what I could do by way of\nreparation; for I was resolved to do anything.  He replied: \"This\nis not the time for rest;\" that I must hasten on the foundations,\nfor He would take His rest with the souls which entered the\nmonasteries; that I must admit all who offered themselves,\nbecause there were many souls that did not serve Him because they\nhad no place wherein to do it; that those monasteries which were\nto be founded in small towns should be like this; that the merit\nof those in them would be as great, if they only desired to do\nthat which was done in the other houses; that I must contrive to\nput them all under the jurisdiction of one superior, [2] and take\ncare that anxieties about means of bodily maintenance did not\ndestroy interior peace, for He would help us, so that we should\nnever be in want of food.  Especial care was to be had of the\nsick sisters; the prioress who did not provide for and comfort\nthe sick was like the friends of Job: He sent them sickness for\nthe good of their souls, and careless superiors risked the\npatience of their nuns.  I was to write the history of the\nfoundation of the monasteries.  I was thinking how there was\nnothing to write about in reference to the foundation of Medina,\nwhen He asked me, what more did I want to see than that the\nfoundation there was miraculous?  By this He meant to say that He\nalone had done it, when it seemed impossible. [3]  I resolved to\nexecute His commands.\n3. Our Lord told me something I was to tell another, and as I was\nconsidering how I did not understand it at all,--though I prayed\nto Him, and was thinking it might be from Satan,--He said to me\nthat it was not, and that He Himself would warn me when the\ntime came.\n4. Once, when I was thinking how much more purely they live who\nwithdraw themselves from all business, and how ill it goes with\nme, and how many faults I must be guilty of, when I have business\nto transact, I heard this: \"It cannot be otherwise, My daughter;\nbut strive thou always after a good intention in all things, and\ndetachment; lift up thine eyes to Me, and see that all thine\nactions may resemble Mine.\"\n5. Thinking how it was that I scarcely ever fell into a trance of\nlate in public, I heard this: \"It is not necessary now; thou art\nsufficiently esteemed for My purpose; we are considering the\nweakness of the wicked.\"\n6. One Tuesday after the Ascension, [4] having prayed for awhile\nafter Communion in great distress, because I was so distracted\nthat I could fix my mind on nothing, I complained of our poor\nnature to our Lord.  The fire began to kindle in my soul, and I\nsaw, as it seemed to me, the most Holy Trinity [5] distinctly\npresent in an intellectual vision, whereby my soul understood\nthrough a certain representation, as a figure of the truth, so\nfar as my dulness could understand, how God is Three and One; and\nthus it seemed to me that all the Three Persons spoke to me, that\nThey were distinctly present in my soul, saying unto me \"that\nfrom that day forth I should see that my soul had grown better in\nthree ways, and that each one of the Three Persons had bestowed\non me a distinct grace,--in charity, in suffering joyfully, in a\nsense of that charity in my soul, accompanied with fervour.\"\nI learnt the meaning of those words of our Lord, that the Three\nDivine Persons will dwell in the soul that is in a state of\ngrace. [6]  Afterwards giving thanks to our Lord for so great a\nmercy, and finding myself utterly unworthy of it, I asked His\nMajesty with great earnestness how it was that He, after showing\nsuch mercies to me, let me go out of His hand, and allowed me to\nbecome so wicked; for on the previous day I had been in great\ndistress on account of my sins, which I had set before me.  I saw\nclearly then how much our Lord on His part had done, ever since\nmy infancy, to draw me to Himself by means most effectual, and\nyet, that all had failed.  Then I had a clear perception of the\nsurpassing love of God for us, in that He forgives us all this\nwhen we turn to Him, and for me more than for any other, for many\nreasons.  The vision of the Three Divine Persons--one God--made\nso profound an impression on my soul, that if it had continued it\nwould have been impossible for me not to be recollected in so\ndivine a company.  What I saw and heard besides is beyond my\npower to describe.\n7. Once, when I was about to communicate,--it was shortly before\nI had this vision,--the Host being still in the ciborium, for It\nhad not yet been given me, I saw something like a dove, which\nmoved its wings with a sound.  It disturbed me so much, and so\ncarried me away out of myself, that it was with the utmost\ndifficulty I received the Host.  All this took place in\nSt. Joseph of Avila.  It was Father Francis Salcedo who was\ngiving me the most Holy Sacrament.  Hearing Mass another day, I\nsaw our Lord glorious in the Host; He said to me that his\nsacrifice was acceptable unto Him.\n8. I heard this once: \"The time will come when many miracles will\nbe wrought in this church; it will be called the holy church.\"\nIt was in St. Joseph of Avila, in the year 1571.\n9. I retain to this day, which is the Commemoration of St. Paul,\nthe presence of the Three Persons of which I spoke in the\nbeginning; [7] they are present almost continually in my soul.\nI, being accustomed to the presence of Jesus Christ only, always\nthought that the vision of the Three Persons was in some degree a\nhindrance, though I know the Three Persons are but One God.\nTo-day, while thinking of this, our Lord said to me \"that I was\nwrong in imagining that those things which are peculiar to the\nsoul can be represented by those of the body; I was to understand\nthat they were very different, and that the soul had a capacity\nfor great fruition.\"  It seemed to me as if this were shown to me\nthus: as water penetrates and is drunk in by the sponge, so, it\nseemed to me, did the Divinity fill my soul, which in a certain\nsense had the fruition and possession of the Three Persons.  And\nI heard Him say also: \"Labour thou not to hold Me within thyself\nenclosed, but enclose thou thyself within Me.\"  It seemed to me\nthat I saw the Three Persons within my soul, and communicating\nThemselves to all creatures abundantly without ceasing to be\nwith me.\n10. A few days after this, thinking whether they were right who\ndisapproved of my going out to make new foundations, and whether\nit would not be better for me if I occupied myself always with\nprayer, I heard this: \"During this life, the true gain consists\nnot in striving after greater joy in Me, but in doing My will.\"\nIt seemed to me, considering what St. Paul says about women, how\nthey should stay at home, [8]--people reminded me lately of this,\nand, indeed, I had heard it before,--it might be the will of God\nI should do so too.  He said to me: \"Tell them they are not to\nfollow one part of the Scripture by itself, without looking to\nthe other parts also; perhaps, if they could, they would like to\ntie My hands.\"\n11. One day after the octave of the Visitation, in one of the\nhermitages of Mount Carmel, praying to God for one of my\nbrothers, I said to our Lord,--I do not know whether it was only\nin thought or not, for my brother was in a place where his\nsalvation was in peril,--\"If I saw one of Thy brethren, O Lord,\nin this danger, what would I not do to help him!\"  It seemed to\nme there was nothing that I could do which I would not have done.\nOur Lord said to me: \"O daughter, daughter! the nuns of the\nIncarnation are thy sisters, and thou holdest back.\nTake courage, then.  Behold, this is what I would have thee do:\nit is not so difficult as it seems; and though it seems to thee\nthat by going thither thy foundations will be ruined, yet it is\nby thy going that both these and the monastery of the Incarnation\nwill gain; resist not, for My power is great.\" [9]\n12. Once, when thinking of the great penance practised by Do\u00f1a\nCatalina de Cardona, [10] and how I might have done more,\nconsidering the desires which our Lord had given me at times, if\nit had not been for my obedience to my confessors, I asked myself\nwhether it would not be as well if I disobeyed them for the\nfuture in this matter.  Our Lord said to me: \"No, My daughter;\nthou art on the sound and safe road.  Seest thou all her penance?\nI think more of thy\u00a0obedience.\"\n13. Once, when I was in prayer, He showed me by a certain kind of\nintellectual vision the condition of a soul in a state of grace:\nin its company I saw by intellectual vision the most Holy\nTrinity, from whose companionship the soul derived a power which\nwas a dominion over the whole earth.  I understood the meaning of\nthose words in the Canticle: \"Let my Beloved come into His garden\nand eat.\" [11]  He showed me also the condition of a soul in sin,\nutterly powerless, like a person tied and bound and blindfold,\nwho, though anxious to see, yet cannot, being unable to walk or\nto hear, and in grievous obscurity.  I was so exceedingly sorry\nfor such souls, that, to deliver only one, any trouble seemed to\nme light.  I thought it impossible for any one who saw this as I\nsaw it,--and I can hardly explain it,--willingly to forfeit so\ngreat a good or continue in so evil a state.\n14. One day, in very great distress about the state of the Order,\nand casting about for means to succour it, our Lord said to me:\n\"Do thou what is in thy power, and leave Me to Myself, and be not\ndisquieted by anything; rejoice in the blessing thou hast\nreceived, for it is a very great one.  My Father is pleased with\nthee, and the Holy Ghost loves thee.\"\n15. \"Thou art ever desiring trials, and, on the other hand,\ndeclining them.  I order things according to what I know thy will\nis, and not according to thy sensuality and weakness.  Be strong,\nfor thou seest how I help thee; I have wished thee to gain this\ncrown. Thou shalt see the Order of the Virgin greatly advanced in\nthy days.\"  I heard this from our Lord about the middle of\nFebruary, 1571.\n16. On the eve of St. Sebastian, the first year of my being in\nthe monastery of the Incarnation [12] as prioress there, at the\nbeginning of the Salve, I saw the Mother of God descend with a\nmultitude of angels to the stall of the prioress, where the image\nof our Lady is, and sit there herself.  I think I did not see the\nimage then, but only our Lady.  She seemed to be like that\npicture of her which the Countess [13] gave me; but I had no time\nto ascertain this, because I fell at once into a trance.\nMultitudes of angels seemed to me to be above the canopies of the\nstalls, and on the desks in front of them; but I saw no bodily\nforms, for the vision was intellectual.  She remained there\nduring the Salve, and said to me: \"Thou hast done well to place\nme here; I will be present when the sisters sing the praises of\nmy Son, and will offer them to Him.\"  After this I remained in\nthat prayer which I still practise, and which is that of keeping\nmy soul in the company of the most Holy Trinity; and it seemed to\nme that the Person of the Father drew me to Himself, and spoke to\nme most comfortable words.  Among them were these, while showing\nhow He loved me: \"I give thee My Son, and the Holy Ghost, and the\nVirgin: what canst thou give Me?\" [14]\n17. On the octave of the Holy Ghost, our Lord was gracious unto\nme, and gave me hopes of this house, [15] that it would go on\nimproving--I mean the souls that are in it.\n18. On the feast of the Magdalene, our Lord again confirmed a\ngrace I had received in Toledo, electing me, in the absence of a\ncertain person, in her place.\n19. In the monastery of the Incarnation, and in the second year\nof my being prioress there, on the octave of St. Martin, when I\nwas going to Communion, the Father, Fr. John of the\nCross, [16]--divided the Host between me and another sister.\nI thought it was done, not because there was any want of Hosts,\nbut that he wished to mortify me because I had told him how much\nI delighted in Hosts of a large size.  Yet I was not ignorant\nthat the size of the Host is of no moment; for I knew that our\nLord is whole and entire in the smallest particle.  His Majesty\nsaid to me: \"Have no fear, My daughter; for no one will be able\nto separate thee from Me,\"--giving me to understand that the size\nof the Host mattered not.\n20. Then appearing to me, as on other occasions, in an imaginary\nvision, most interiorly, He held out His right hand and said:\n\"Behold this nail! it is the pledge of thy being My bride from\nthis day forth.  Until now thou hadst not merited it; from\nhenceforth thou shalt regard My honour, not only as of one who is\nThy Creator, King, and God, but as thine, My veritable bride; My\nhonour is thine, and thine is Mine.\"  This grace had such an\neffect on me, that I could not contain myself: I became as one\nthat is foolish, and said to our Lord: \"Either ennoble my\nvileness or cease to bestow such mercies on me, for certainly I\ndo not think that nature can bear them.\"  I remained thus the\nwhole day, as one utterly beside herself.  Afterwards I became\nconscious of great progress, and greater shame and distress to\nsee that I did nothing in return for graces so great.\n21. Our Lord said this to me one day: \"Thinkest thou, My\ndaughter, that meriting lies in fruition? No; merit lies only in\ndoing, in suffering, and in loving.  You never heard that\nSt. Paul had the fruition of heavenly joys more than once; while\nhe was often in sufferings. [17]  Thou seest how My whole life\nwas full of dolors, and only on Mount Tabor hast thou heard of Me\nin glory. [18]  Do not suppose, when thou seest My Mother hold Me\nin her arms, that she had that joy unmixed with heavy sorrows.\nFrom the time that Simeon spoke to her, My Father made her see in\nclear light all I had to suffer.  The grand Saints of the desert,\nas they were led by God, so also did they undergo heavy penances;\nbesides, they waged serious war with the devil and with\nthemselves, and much of their time passed away without any\nspiritual consolation whatever.  Believe Me, My daughter, his\ntrials are the heaviest whom My Father loves most; trials are the\nmeasure of His love.  How can I show My love for thee better than\nby desiring for thee what I desired for Myself?  Consider My\nwounds; thy pains will never reach to them.  This is the way of\ntruth; thus shalt thou help Me to weep over the ruin of those who\nare in the world, for thou knowest how all their desires,\nanxieties, and thoughts tend the other way.\"  When I began my\nprayer that day, my headache was so violent that I thought I\ncould not possibly go on.  Our Lord said to me: \"Behold now, the\nreward of suffering.  As thou, on account of thy health, wert\nunable to speak to Me, I spoke to thee and comforted thee.\"\nCertainly, so it was; for the time of my recollection lasted\nabout an hour and a half, more or less.  It was then that He\nspoke to me the words I have just related, together with all the\nothers.  I was not able to distract myself, neither knew I where\nI was; my joy was so great as to be indescribable; my headache\nwas gone, and I was amazed, and I had a longing for suffering.\nHe also told me to keep in mind the words He said to His\nApostles: \"The servant is not greater than his Lord.\" [19]\n1.

I found myself the whole of yesterday in great desolation,\nand, except at Communion, did not feel that it was the day of the\nResurrection.  Last night, being with the community, I heard\none [1] of them singing how hard it is to be living away from\nGod.  As I was then suffering, the effect of that singing on me\nwas such that a numbness began in my hands, and no efforts of\nmine could hinder it; but as I go out of myself in raptures of\njoy, so then my soul was thrown into a trance through the\nexcessive pain, and remained entranced; and until this day I had\nnot felt this.  A few days previously I thought that the vehement\nimpulses were not so great as they used to be, and now it seems\nto be that the reason is what I have described; I know not if it\nis so.  Hitherto the pain had not gone so far as to make me\nbeside myself; and as it is so unendurable, and as I retained the\ncontrol of my senses, it made me utter loud cries beyond my power\nto restrain.  Now that it has grown, it has reached this point of\npiercing me; and I understand more of that piercing which our\nLady suffered; for until to-day, as I have just said, I never\nknew what that piercing was.  My body was so bruised, that I\nsuffer even now when I am writing this; for my hands are as if\nthe joints were loosed, and in pain. [2]  You, my father, will\ntell me when you see me whether this trance be the effect of\nsuffering, or whether I felt it, or whether I am deceived.\n2. I was in this great pain till this morning; and, being in\nprayer, I fell into a profound trance; and it seemed to me that\nour Lord had taken me up in spirit to His Father, and said to\nHim: \"Whom Thou hast given to Me, I give to Thee;\" [3] and He\nseemed to draw me near to Himself.  This is not an imaginary\nvision, but one most certain, and so spiritually subtile that it\ncannot be explained.  He spoke certain words to me which I do not\nremember.  Some of them referred to His grace, which He bestows\non me.  He kept me by Him for some time.\n3. As you, my father, went away yesterday so soon, and I consider\nthe many affairs which detain you, so that it is impossible for\nme to have recourse to you for comfort even when necessary,--for\nI see that your occupations are most urgent,--I was for some time\nin pain and sadness.  As I was then in desolation,--as I said\nbefore,--that helped me; and as nothing on earth, I thought, had\nany attractions for me, I had a scruple, and feared I was\nbeginning to lose that liberty.  This took place last night; and\nto-day our Lord answered my doubt, and said to me \"that I was not\nto be surprised; for as men seek for companions with whom they\nmay speak of their sensual satisfactions, so the soul--when there\nis any one who understands it--seeks those to whom it may\ncommunicate its pleasures and its pains, and is sad and mourns\nwhen it can find none.\"  He said to me: \"Thou art prosperous now,\nand thy works please Me.\"  As He remained with me for some time,\nI remembered that I had told you, my father, that these visions\npass quickly away; He said to me \"that there was a difference\nbetween these and the imaginary visions, and that there could not\nbe an invariable law concerning the graces He bestowed on us; for\nit was expedient to give them now in one way, now in another.\"\n4. After Communion, I saw our Lord most distinctly close beside\nme; and He began to comfort me with great sweetness, and said to\nme, among other things: \"Thou beholdest Me present, My\ndaughter,--it is I.  Show me thy hands.\"  And to me He seemed to\ntake them and to put them to His side, and said: \"Behold My\nwounds; thou art not without Me.  Finish the short course of thy\nlife.\"  By some things He said to me, I understood that, after\nHis Ascension, He never came down to the earth except in the most\nHoly Sacrament to communicate Himself to any one.  He said to me,\nthat when He rose again He showed Himself to our Lady, because\nshe was in great trouble; for sorrow had so pierced her soul that\nshe did not even recover herself at once in order to have the\nfruition of that joy.  By this I saw how different was my\npiercing. [4]  But what must that of the Virgin have been?\nHe remained long with her then because it was necessary to\nconsole her.\n5. On Palm Sunday, at Communion, I was in a deep trance,--so much\nso, that I was not able even to swallow the Host; and, still\nhaving It in my mouth, when I had come a little to myself, I\nverily believed that my mouth was all filled with Blood; and my\nface and my whole body seemed to be covered with It, as if our\nLord had been shedding It at that moment.  I thought It was warm,\nand the sweetness I then felt was exceedingly great; and our Lord\nsaid to me: \"Daughter, My will is that My Blood should profit\nthee; and be not thou afraid that My compassion will fail thee.\nI shed It in much suffering, and, as thou seest, thou hast the\nfruition of It in great joy.  I reward thee well for the pleasure\nthou gavest me to-day.\"  He said this because I have been in the\nhabit of going to Communion, if possible, on this day for more\nthan thirty years, and of labouring to prepare my soul to be the\nhost of our Lord; for I considered the cruelty of the Jews to be\nvery great, after giving Him so grand a reception, in letting Him\ngo so far for supper; and I used to picture Him as remaining with\nme, and truly in a poor lodging, as I see now.  And thus I used\nto have such foolish thoughts--they must have been acceptable to\nour Lord, for this was one of the visions which I regard as most\ncertain; and, accordingly it has been a great blessing to me in\nthe matter of Communion.\n6. Previous to this, I had been, I believe, for three days in\nthat great pain, which I feel sometimes more than at others,\nbecause I am away from God; and during those days it had been\nvery great, and seemingly more than I could bear.  Being thus\nexceedingly wearied by it, I saw it was late to take my\ncollation, nor could I do so,--for if I do not take it a little\nearlier, it occasions great weakness because of my sickness; and\nthen, doing violence to myself, I took up some bread to prepare\nfor collation, and on the instant Christ appeared, and seemed to\nbe breaking the bread and putting it into my mouth.  He said to\nme: \"Eat, My daughter, and bear it as well as thou canst.\nI condole with thee in thy suffering; but it is good for thee\nnow.\" My pain was gone, and I was comforted; for He seemed to be\nreally with me then, and the whole of the next day; and with this\nmy desires were then satisfied.  The word \"condole\" made me\nstrong; for now I do not think I am suffering at all.\n1. Isabel of Jesus, born in Segovia, and whose family name was\nJimena, told Ribera (vide lib. iv. c. v.) that she was the\nsinger, being then a novice in\u00a0Salamanca.\n2.

See above, \u00a7 1.\nRelation V.\nObservations on Certain Points of Spirituality.\n1. \"What is it that distresses thee, little sinner?  Am I not thy\nGod?  Dost thou not see how ill I am treated here?  If thou\nlovest Me, why art thou not sorry for Me?  Daughter, light is\nvery different from darkness.  I am faithful; no one will be lost\nwithout knowing it.  He must be deceiving himself who relies on\nspiritual sweetnesses; the true safety lies in the witness of a\ngood conscience. [1]  But let no one think that of himself he can\nabide in the light, any more than he can hinder the natural night\nfrom coming on; for that depends on My grace.  The best means he\ncan have for retaining the light is the conviction in his soul\nthat he can do nothing of himself, and that it comes from Me;\nfor, even if he were in the light, the instant I withdraw, night\nwill come.  True humility is this: the soul's knowing what itself\ncan do, and what I can do.  Do not neglect to write down the\ncounsels I give thee, that thou mayest not forget them.\nThou seekest to have the counsels of men in writing; why, then,\nthinkest thou that thou art wasting time in writing down those I\ngive thee?  The time will come when thou shalt require them all.\"\nOn Union.\n2. \"Do not suppose, My daughter, that to be near to Me is union;\nfor they who sin against Me are near Me, though they do not wish\nit.  Nor is union the joys and comforts of union, [2] though they\nbe of the very highest kind, and though they come from Me.\nThese very often are means of winning souls, even if they are not\nin a state of grace.\"  When I heard this, I was in a high degree\nlifted up in spirit.  Our Lord showed me what the spirit was, and\nwhat the state of the soul was then, and the meaning of those\nwords of the Magnificat, \"Exultavit spiritus meus.\"  He showed me\nthat the spirit was the higher part of the will.\n3. To return to union; I understood it to be a spirit, pure and\nraised up above all the things of earth, with nothing remaining\nin it that would swerve from the will of God, being a spirit and\na will resigned to His will, and in detachment from all things,\noccupied in God in such a way as to leave no trace of any love of\nself, or of any created thing whatever. [3]  Thereupon, I\nconsidered that, if this be union, it comes to this, that, as my\nsoul is always abiding in this resolution, we can say of it that\nit is always in this prayer of union: and yet it is true that the\nunion lasts but a very short time.  It was suggested to me that,\nas to living in justice, meriting and making progress, it will be\nso; but it cannot be said that the soul is in union as it is when\nin contemplation; and I thought I understood, yet not by words\nheard, that the dust of our wretchedness, faults, and\nimperfections, wherein we bury ourselves, is so great, that it is\nnot possible to live in such pureness as the spirit is in when in\nunion with God, raised up and out of our wretched misery.  And I\nthink, if it be union to have our will and spirit in union with\nthe will and Spirit of God, that it is not possible for any one\nnot in a state of grace to attain thereto; and I have been told\nso.  Accordingly, I believe it is very difficult to know when the\nsoul is in union; to have that knowledge is a special grace of\nGod, because nobody can tell whether he is in a state of grace\nor not. [4]\n4. You will show me in writing, my father, what you think of\nthis, and how I am in the wrong, and send me this paper back.\n5. I had read in a book that it was an imperfection to possess\npictures well painted,--and I would not, therefore, retain in my\ncell one that I had; and also, before I had read this, I thought\nthat it was poverty to possess none, except those made of\npaper,--and, as I read this afterwards, I would not have any of\nany other material.  I learnt from our Lord, when I was not\nthinking at all about this, what I am going to say: \"that this\nmortification was not right.  Which is better, poverty or\ncharity?  But as love was the better, whatever kindled love in\nme, that I must not give up, nor take away from my nuns; for the\nbook spoke of much adorning and curious devices--not of\npictures. [5]  What Satan was doing among the Lutherans was the\ntaking away from them all those means by which their love might\nbe the more quickened; and thus they were going to perdition.\nThose who are loyal to Me, My daughter, must now, more than ever,\ndo the very reverse of what they do.\"  I understood that I was\nunder great obligations to serve our Lady and St. Joseph,\nbecause, when I was utterly lost, God, through their prayers,\ncame and saved me.\n6. One day, after the feast of St. Matthew, [6] I was as is usual\nwith me, after seeing in a vision the most Holy Trinity, and how\nIt is present in a soul in a state of grace. [7]  I understood\nthe mystery most clearly, in such a way that, after a certain\nfashion and comparisons, I saw It in an imaginary vision.\nAnd though at other times I have seen the most Holy Trinity in an\nintellectual vision, for some days after the truth of it did not\nrest with me,--as it does now,--I mean, so that I could dwell\nupon it.  I see now that it is just as learned men told me; and I\ndid not understand it as I do now, though I believed them without\nthe least hesitation; for I never had any temptations against\nthe faith.\n7. It seems to us ignorant women that the Persons of the most\nHoly Trinity are all Three, as we see Them painted, in one\nPerson, after the manner of those pictures, which represent a\nbody with three faces; and thus it causes such astonishment in us\nthat we look on it as impossible, and so there is nobody who\ndares to think of it; for the understanding is perplexed, is\nafraid it may come to doubt the truth, and that robs us of a\ngreat blessing.\n8. What I have seen is this: Three distinct Persons each one by\nHimself visible, and by Himself speaking. [8]  And afterwards I\nhave been thinking that the Son alone took human flesh, whereby\nthis truth is known.  The Persons love, communicate, and know\nThemselves.  Then, if each one is by Himself, how can we say that\nthe Three are one Essence, and so believe?  That is a most deep\ntruth, and I would die for it a thousand times.  In the Three\nPersons there is but one will and one power and one might;\nneither can One be without Another: so that of all created things\nthere is but one sole Creator.  Could the Son create an ant\nwithout the Father?  No; because the power is all one.  The same\nis to be said of the Holy Ghost.  Thus, there is one God\nAlmighty, and the Three Persons are one Majesty.  Is it possible\nto love the Father without loving the Son and the Holy Ghost?\nNo; for he who shall please One of the Three pleases the Three\nPersons; and he who shall offend One offends All.  Can the Father\nbe without the Son and without the Holy Ghost?  No; for They are\none substance, and where One is there are the Three; for they\ncannot be divided.  How, then, is it that we see the Three\nPersons distinct? and how is it that the Son, not the Father, nor\nthe Holy Ghost, took human flesh?  This is what I have never\nunderstood; theologians know it.  I know well that the Three were\nthere when that marvellous work was done, and I do not busy\nmyself with much thinking thereon.  All my thinking thereon comes\nat once to this: that I see God is almighty, that He has done\nwhat He would, and so can do what He will.  The less I understand\nit, the more I believe it, and the greater the devotion it\nexcites in me.  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.\n9. If our Lord had not been so gracious with me as He has been, I\ndo not think I should have had the courage to do what has been\ndone, nor strength to undergo the labours endured, with the\ncontradictions and the opinions of men.  And accordingly, since\nthe beginning of the foundations, I have lost the fears I\nformerly had, thinking that I was under delusions,--and I had a\nconviction that it was the work of God: having this, I ventured\nupon difficult things, though always with advice and under\nobedience.  I see in this that when our Lord willed to make a\nbeginning of the Order, and of His mercy made use of me, His\nMajesty had to supply all that I was deficient in, which was\neverything, in order that the work might be effected, and that\nHis greatness might be the more clearly revealed in one\nso wicked.\n10. Antiochus was unendurable to himself, and to those who were\nabout him, because of the stench of his many sins. [9]\n11. Confession is for faults and sins, and not for virtues, nor\nfor anything of the kind relating to prayer.  These things are to\nbe treated of out of confession with one who understands the\nmatter,--and let the prioress see to this; and the nun must\nexplain the straits she is in, in order that the proper helps may\nbe found for her; for Cassian says that he who does not know the\nfact, as well as he who has never seen or learnt, that men can\nswim, will think, when he sees people throw themselves into the\nriver, that they will all be drowned. [10]\n12. Our Lord would have Joseph tell the vision to his brethren,\nand have it known, though it was to cost Joseph so much.\n13. How the soul has a sense of fear when God is about to bestow\nany great grace upon it; that sense is the worship of the spirit,\nas that of the four [11] elders spoken of in Scripture.\n14. How, when the faculties are suspended, it is to be understood\nthat certain matters are suggested to the soul, to be by it\nrecommended to God; that an angel suggests them, of whom it is\nsaid in the Scriptures that he was burning incense and offering\nup the prayers of the saints.

Apoc. viii. 4.\nRelation VI.\nThe Vow of Obedience to Father Gratian Which the Saint Made\nin 1575.\n1. In the year 1575, in the month of April, when I was founding\nthe monastery of Veas, Fra Jerome of the Mother of God Gratian\nhappened to come thither. [1]  I began to go to confession to him\nfrom time to time, though not looking upon him as filling the\nplace of the other confessors I had, so as to be wholly directed\nby him.  One day, when I was taking food, but without any\ninterior recollection whatever, my soul began to be recollected\nin such a way that I thought I must fall into a trance; and I had\na vision, that passed away with the usual swiftness, like a\nmeteor.  I seemed to see close beside me Jesus Christ our Lord,\nin the form wherein His Majesty is wont to reveal Himself, with\nF. Gratian on His right.  Our Lord took his right hand and mine,\nand, joining them together, said to me that He would have me\naccept him in His place for my whole life, and that we were both\nto have one mind in all things, for so it was fitting.  I was\nprofoundly convinced that this was the work of God, though I\nremembered with regret two of my confessors whom I frequented in\nturn for a long time, and to whom I owed much; that one for whom\nI have a great affection especially caused a terrible resistance.\nNevertheless, not being able to persuade myself that the vision\nwas a delusion, because it had a great power and influence over\nme, and also because it was said to me on two other occasions\nthat I was not to be afraid, that He wished this,--the words were\ndifferent,--I made up my mind at last to act upon them,\nunderstanding it to be our Lord's will, and to follow that\ncounsel so long as I should live.  I had never before so acted\nwith any one, though I had consulted many persons of great\nlearning and holiness, and who watched over my soul with great\ncare,--but neither had I received any such direction as that I\nshould make no change; for as to my confessors, of some I\nunderstood that they would be profitable to me, and so also\nof these.\n2. When I had resolved on this, I found myself in peace and\ncomfort so great that I was amazed, and assured of our Lord's\nwill; for I do not think that Satan could fill the soul with\npeace and comfort such as this: and so, whenever I think of it, I\npraise our Lord, and remember the words, \"posuit fines tuos\npacem,\" [2] and I wish I could wear myself out in the praises\nof God.\n3. It must have been about a month after this my resolve was\nmade, on the second day after Pentecost, when I was going to\nfound the monastery in Seville, that we heard Mass in a hermitage\nin Ecija, and rested there during the hottest part of the day.\nThose who were with me remained in the hermitage while I was by\nmyself in the sacristy belonging to it.  I began to think of one\ngreat grace which I received of the Holy Ghost, on one of the\nvigils of His feast, [3] and a great desire arose within me of\ndoing Him some most special service, and I found nothing that was\nnot already done,--at least, resolved upon,--for all I do must be\nfaulty; and I remembered that, though I had already made a vow of\nobedience, it might be made in greater perfection, and I had an\nimpression it would be pleasing unto Him if I promised that which\nI was already resolved upon, to live under obedience to the\nFather-Master, Fr. Jerome.  On the other hand, I seemed to be\ndoing nothing, because I was already bent on doing it; on the\nother hand, it would be a very serious thing, considering that\nour interior state is not made known to the superiors who receive\nour vows, and that they change, and that, if one is not doing his\nwork well, another comes in his place; and I believed I should\nhave none of my liberty all my life long, either outwardly or\ninwardly, and this constrained me greatly to abstain from making\nthe vow.  This repugnance of the will made me ashamed, and I saw\nthat, now I had something I could do for God, I was not doing it;\nit was a sad thing for my resolution to serve Him.  The fact is,\nthat the objection so pressed me, that I do not think I ever did\nanything in my life that was so hard--not even my\nprofession--unless it be that of my leaving my father's house to\nbecome a nun. [4]  The reason of this was that I had forgotten my\naffection for him, and his gifts for directing me; yea, rather, I\nwas looking on it then as a strange thing, which has surprised\nme; feeling nothing but a great fear whether the vow would be for\nthe service of God or not: and my natural self--which is fond of\nliberty--must have been doing its work, though for years now I\nhave no pleasure in it.  But it seemed to me a far other matter\nto give up that liberty by a vow, as in truth it is.  After a\nprotracted struggle, our Lord gave me great confidence; and I saw\nit was the better course, the more I felt about it: if I made\nthis promise in honour of the Holy Ghost, He would be bound to\ngive him light for the direction of my soul; and I remembered at\nthe same time that our Lord had given him to me as my guide.\nThereupon I fell upon my knees, and, to render this tribute of\nservice to the Holy Ghost, made a promise to do whatever he\nshould bid me do while I lived, provided nothing were required of\nme contrary to the law of God and the commands of superiors whom\nI am more bound to obey.  I adverted to this, that the obligation\ndid not extend to things of little importance,--as if I were to\nbe importunate with him about anything, and he bade me cease, and\nI neglected his advice and repeated my request,--nor to things\nrelating to my convenience.  In a word, his commands were not to\nbe about trifles, done without reflection; and I was not\nknowingly to conceal from him my faults and sins, or my interior\nstate; and this, too, is more than we allow to superiors.  In a\nword, I promised to regard him as in the place of God, outwardly\nand inwardly.  I know not if it be so, but I seemed to have done\na great thing in honour of the Holy Ghost--at least, it was all I\ncould do, and very little it was in comparison with what I\nowe Him.\n4. I give God thanks, who has created one capable of this work: I\nhave the greatest confidence that His Majesty will bestow on him\ngreat graces; and I myself am so happy and joyous, that I seem to\nbe in every way free from myself; and though I thought that my\nobedience would be a burden, I have attained to the\ngreatest freedom.  May our Lord be praised for ever!\n1. See Foundations, ch. xxii.\n2. Psalm cxlvii. 14: \"He hath made thy borders peace.\"\n3. Perhaps the Saint refers to what she has written in her Life,\nch. xxxviii. \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12.\n4. Life, ch. iv. \u00a7 1.\nRelation VII.\nMade for Rodrigo Alvarez, S.J., in the Year 1575, According to\nDon Vicente de la Fuente; but in 1576, According to the\nBollandists and F. Bouix.\n1. This nun took the habit forty years ago, and from the first\nbegan to reflect on the mysteries of the Passion of Christ our\nLord, and on her own sins, for some time every day, without\nthinking at all of anything supernatural, but only of created\nthings, or of such subjects as suggested to her how soon the end\nof all things must come, discerning in creatures the greatness of\nGod and His love for us.\n2. This made her much more willing to serve Him: she was never\nunder the influence of fear, and made no account of it, but had\nalways a great desire to see God honoured, and His glory\nincreased.  To that end were all her prayers directed, without\nmaking any for herself; for she thought that it mattered little\nif she had to suffer in purgatory in exchange for the increase of\nHis glory even in the slightest degree.\n3. In this she spent about two-and-twenty years in great\naridities, and never did it enter into her thoughts to desire\nanything else; for she regarded herself as one who, she thought,\ndid not deserve even to think about God, except that His Majesty\nwas very merciful to her in allowing her to remain in His\npresence, saying her prayers, reading also in good books.\n4. It must be about eighteen years since she began to arrange\nabout the first monastery of Barefooted Carmelites which she\nfounded.  It was in Avila, three or two years before,--I believe\nit is three,--she began to think that she occasionally heard\ninterior locutions, and had visions and revelations interiorly.\nShe saw with the eyes of the soul, for she never saw anything\nwith her bodily eyes, nor heard anything with her bodily ears;\ntwice, she thinks, she heard a voice, but she understood not what\nwas said.  It was a sort of making things present when she saw\nthese things interiorly; they passed away like a meteor most\nfrequently.  The vision, however, remained so impressed on her\nmind, and produced such effects, that it was as if she saw those\nthings with her bodily eyes, and more.\n5. She was then by nature so very timid, that she would not dare\nto be alone even by day, at times.  And as she could not escape\nfrom these visitations, though she tried with all her might, she\nwent about in very great distress, afraid that it was a delusion\nof Satan, and began to consult spiritual men of the Society of\nJesus about it, among whom were Father Araoz, who was Commissary\nof the Society, and who happened to go to that place, and Father\nFrancis, who was Duke of Gandia,--him she consulted twice; [1]\nalso a Provincial, now in Rome, called Gil Gonzalez, and him also\nwho is now Provincial of Castille,--this latter, however, not so\noften,--Father Baltasar Alvarez who is now Rector in Salamanca;\nand he heard her confession for six years at this time; also the\npresent Rector of Cuenca, Salazar by name; the Rector of Segovia,\ncalled Santander; the Rector of Burgos, whose name is\nRipalda,--and he thought very ill of her when he heard of these\nthings, till after he had conversed with her; the Doctor Paul\nHernandez in Toledo, who was a Consultor of the Inquisition, him\nwho was Rector in Salamanca when she talked to him; the Doctor\nGutierrez, and other fathers, some of the Society, whom she knew\nto be spiritual men, these she sought out, if any were in those\nplaces where she went to found monasteries.\n6. With the Father Fra Peter of Alcantara, who was a holy man of\nthe Barefooted Friars of St. Francis, she had many\ncommunications, and he it was who insisted so much upon it that\nher spirit should be regarded as good.  They were more than six\nyears trying her spirit minutely, as it is already described at\nvery great length, [2] as will be shown hereafter: and she\nherself in tears and deep affliction; for the more they tried\nher, the more she fell into raptures, and into trances very\noften,--not, however, deprived of her senses.\n7. Many prayers were made, and many Masses were said, that our\nLord would lead her by another way, [3] for her fear was very\ngreat when she was not in prayer; though in everything relating\nto the state of her soul she was very much better, and a great\ndifference was visible, there was no vainglory, nor had she any\ntemptation thereto, nor to pride; on the contrary, she was very\nmuch ashamed and confounded when she saw that people knew of her\nstate, and except with her confessors or any one who would give\nher light, she never spoke of these things, and it was more\npainful to speak of them than if they had been grave sins; for it\nseemed to her that people must laugh at her, [4] and that these\nthings were womanish imaginations, which she had always heard of\nwith disgust.\n8. About thirteen years ago, more or less, after the house of\nSt. Joseph was founded, into which she had gone from the other\nmonastery, came the present Bishop of Salamanca, Inquisitor, I\nthink, of Toledo, previously of Seville, Soto by name. [5]  She\ncontrived to have a conference with him for her greater security,\nand told him everything.  He replied, that there was nothing in\nall this that concerned his office, because everything that she\nsaw and heard confirmed her the more in the Catholic faith, in\nwhich she always was, and is, firm, with most earnest desires for\nthe honour of God and the good of souls, willing to suffer death\nmany times for one of them.\n9. He told her, when he saw how distressed she was, to give an\naccount of it all, and of her whole life, without omitting\nanything, to the Master Avila, who was a man of great learning in\nthe way of prayer, and to rest content with the answer he should\ngive.  She did so, and described her sins and her life.  He wrote\nto her and comforted her, giving her great security.  The account\nI gave was such that all those learned men who saw it--they were\nmy confessors--said that it was very profitable for instruction\nin spiritual things; and they commanded her to make copies of it,\nand write another little book [6] for her daughters,--she was\nprioress,--wherein she might give them some instructions.\n10. Notwithstanding all this, she was not without fears at times,\nfor she thought that spiritual men also might be deceived like\nherself.  She told her confessor that he might discuss these\nthings with certain learned men, though they were not much given\nto prayer, for she had no other desire but that of knowing\nwhether what she experienced was in conformity with the sacred\nwritings or not.  Now and then she took comfort in thinking\nthat--though she herself, because of her sins, deserved to fall\ninto delusions--our Lord would not suffer so many good men,\nanxious to give her light, to be led into error.\n11. Having this in view, she began to communicate with fathers of\nthe Order of the glorious St. Dominic, to which, before these\nthings took place, she had been to confession--she does not say\nto them, but to the Order. [7]  These are they with whom she\nafterwards had relations.  The Father Fra Vicente Barron, at that\ntime Consultor of the Holy Office, heard her confessions for\neighteen months in Toledo, and he had done so very many years\nbefore these things began.  He was a very learned man.\nHe reassured her greatly, as did also the fathers of the Society\nspoken of before.  All used to say, If she does not sin against\nGod, and acknowledges her own misery, what has she to be afraid\nof?  She confessed to the Father Fra Pedro Iba\u00f1ez, who was reader\nin Avila; to the Father-Master Fra Dominic Ba\u00f1es, who is now in\nValladolid as rector of the college of St. Gregory, I confessed\nfor six years, and whenever I had occasion to do so communicated\nwith him by letter; also to the Master Chaves; to the\nFather-Master Fra Bartholomew of Medina, professor in Salamanca,\nof whom she knew that he thought ill of her; for she, having\nheard this, thought that he, better than any other, could tell\nher if she was deceived, because he had so little confidence in\nher.  This was more than two years ago.  She contrived to go to\nconfession to him, and gave him a full account of everything\nwhile she remained there; and he saw what she had written, [8]\nfor the purpose of attaining to a better understanding of the\nmatter.  He reassured her so much, and more than all the rest,\nand remained her very good\u00a0friend.\n12. She went to confession also to Fra Philip de Meneses, when\nshe founded the monastery of Valladolid, for he was rector of the\ncollege of St. Gregory.  He, having before that heard of her\nstate, had gone to Avila, that he might speak to her,--it was an\nact of great charity,--being desirous of ascertaining whether she\nwas deluded, so that he might enlighten her, and, if she was not,\ndefend her when he heard her spoken against; and he was\nmuch\u00a0satisfied.\n13. She also conferred particularly with Salinas, Dominican\nProvincial, a man of great spirituality; with another licentiate\nnamed Lunar, who was prior of St. Thomas of Avila; and, in\nSegovia, with a reader, Fra Diego de\u00a0Yang\u00fces.\n14. Of these Dominicans some never failed to give themselves\ngreatly to prayer, and perhaps all did.  Some others also she\nconsulted; for in so many years, and because of the fear she was\nin, she had opportunities of doing so, especially as she went\nabout founding monasteries in so many places.  Her spirit was\ntried enough, for everybody wished to be able to enlighten her,\nand thereby reassured her and themselves.  She always, at all\ntimes, wished to submit herself to whatever they enjoined her,\nand she was therefore distressed when, as to these spiritual\nthings, she could not obey them.  Both her own prayer, and that\nof the nuns she has established, are always carefully directed\ntowards the propagation of the faith; and it was for that\npurpose, and for the good of her Order, that she began her\nfirst\u00a0monastery.\n15. She used to say that, if any of these things tended to lead\nher against the Catholic faith and the law of God, she would not\nneed to seek for learned men nor tests, because she would see at\nonce that they came from Satan.  She never undertook anything\nmerely because it came to her in prayer; on the contrary, when\nher confessors bade her do the reverse, she did so without being\nin the least troubled thereat, and she always told them\neverything.  For all that they told her that these things came\nfrom God, she never so thoroughly believed them that she could\nswear to it herself, though it did seem to her that they were\nspiritually safe, because of the effects thereof, and of the\ngreat graces which she at times received; but she always desired\nvirtues more than anything else; and this it is that she has\ncharged her nuns to desire, saying to them that the most humble\nand mortified will be the most\u00a0spiritual.\n16. All that is told and written she communicated to the\nFather-Master Fra Dominic Ba\u00f1es, who is now in Valladolid, and\nwho is the person with whom she has had, and has still, the most\nfrequent communications.  He sent her writings to the Holy Office\nin Madrid, so it is said.  In all this she submits herself to the\nCatholic faith and the Roman Church.  Nobody has found fault with\nthem, because these things are not in the power of any man, and\nour Lord does not require what is\u00a0impossible.\n17. The reason why so much is known about her is that, as she was\nin fear about herself, and described her state to so many, these\ntalked to one another on the subject and also the accident that\nhappened to what she had written. [9]  This has been to her a\nvery grievous torment and cross, and has cost her many tears.\nShe says that this distress is not the effect of humility, but of\nthe causes already mentioned.  Our Lord seems to have given\npermission [10] for this torture for if one spoke more harshly of\nher than others, by little and little he spoke more kindly\nof her.\n18. She took the greatest pains not to submit the state of her\nsoul to any one who she thought would believe that these things\ncame from God, for she was instantly afraid that the devil would\ndeceive them both.  If she saw any one timid about these things,\nto him she laid bare her secrets with the greater joy; though\nalso it gave her pain when, for the purpose of trying her, these\nthings were treated with contempt, for she thought some were\nreally from God, and she would not have people, even if they had\ngood cause, condemn them so absolutely; neither would she have\nthem believe that all were from God; and because she knew\nperfectly well that delusion was possible, therefore it was that\nshe never thought herself altogether safe in a matter wherein\nthere might be danger.\n19. She used to strive with all her might never in any way to\noffend God, and was always obedient; and by these means she\nthought she might obtain her deliverance, by the help of God,\neven if Satan were the cause.\n20. Ever since she became subject to these supernatural\nvisitations, her spirit is always inclined to seek after that\nwhich is most perfect, and she had almost always a great desire\nto suffer; and in the persecutions she underwent, and they were\nmany, she was comforted, and had a particular affection for her\npersecutors.  She had a great desire to be poor and lonely, and\nto depart out of this land of exile in order to see God.\nThrough these effects, and others like them, she began to find\npeace, thinking that a spirit which could leave her with these\nvirtues could not be an evil one, and they who had the charge of\nher soul said so; but it was a peace that came from diminished\nweariness, not from the cessation of fear.\n21. The spirit she is of never urged her to make any of these\nthings known, but to be always obedient. [11]  As it has been\nsaid already, [12] she never saw anything with her bodily eyes,\nbut in a way so subtile and so intellectual that at first she\nsometimes thought that all was the effect of imagination; at\nother times she could not think so.  These things were not\ncontinual, but occurred for the most part when she was in some\ntrouble: as on one occasion, when for some days she had to bear\nunendurable interior pains, and a restlessness of soul arising\nout of the fear that she was deluded by Satan, as it is described\nat length in the account she has given of it, [13] and where her\nsins, for they have been so public, are mentioned with the rest:\nfor the fear she was in made her forget her own good name.\n22. Being thus in distress such as cannot be described, at the\nmere hearing interiorly these words, [14] \"It is I, be not\nafraid,\" her soul became so calm, courageous, and confident, that\nshe could not understand whence so great a blessing had come; for\nher confessor had not been able--and many learned men, with many\nwords, had not been able--to give her that peace and rest which\nthis one word had given her.  And thus, at other times, some\nvision gave her strength, for without that she could not have\nborne such great trials and contradictions, together with\ninfirmities without number, and which she still has to bear,\nthough they are not so many,--for she is never free from some\nsuffering or other, more or less intense.  Her ordinary state is\nconstant pain, with many other infirmities, though since she\nbecame a nun they are more troublesome, if she is doing anything\nin the service of our Lord.  And the mercies He shows her pass\nquickly out of memory, though she often dwells on those\nmercies,--but she is not able to dwell so long upon these as upon\nher sins; these are always a torment to her, most commonly as\nfilth smelling foully.\n23. That her sins are so many, and her service of God so scanty,\nmust be the reason why she is not tempted to vainglory.\nThere never was anything in any of these spiritual visitations\nthat was not wholly pure and clean, nor does she think it can be\notherwise if the spirit be good and the visitations supernatural,\nfor she utterly neglects the body and never thinks of it, being\nwholly intent upon God.\n24. She is also living in great fear about sinning against God,\nand doing His will in all things; this is her continual prayer.\nAnd she is, she thinks, so determined never to swerve from this,\nthat there is nothing her confessors might enjoin her, which she\nconsiders to be for the greater honour of our Lord, that she\nwould not undertake and perform, by the help of our Lord.\nAnd confident that His Majesty helps those who have resolved to\nadvance His service and glory, she thinks no more of herself and\nof her own progress, in comparison with that, than if she did not\nexist, so far as she knows herself, and her confessors think\nso too.\n25. All that is written in this paper is the simple truth, and\nthey, and all others who have had anything to do with her for\nthese twenty years, can justify it.  Most frequently her spirit\nurged her to praise God, and she wished that all the world gave\nitself up to that, even though it should cost her exceedingly.\nHence the desire she has for the good of souls; and from\nconsidering how vile are the things of this world, and how\nprecious are interior things, with which nothing can be compared,\nshe has attained to a contempt of the world.\n26. As for the vision about which you, my father, wish to know\nsomething, it is of this kind: she sees nothing either outwardly\nor inwardly, for the vision is not imaginary: but, without seeing\nanything, she understands what it is, and where it is, more\nclearly than if she saw it, only nothing in particular presents\nitself to her.  She is like a person who feels that another is\nclose beside her; but because she is in the dark she sees him\nnot, yet is certain that he is there present.  Still, this\ncomparison is not exact; for he who is in the dark, in some way\nor other, through hearing a noise or having seen that person\nbefore, knows he is there, or knew it before; but here there is\nnothing of the kind, for without a word, inward or outward, the\nsoul clearly perceives who it is, where he is, and occasionally\nwhat he means. [15]  Why, or how, she perceives it, she knoweth\nnot; but so it is; and while it lasts, she cannot help being\naware of it.  And when it is over,--though she may wish ever so\nmuch to retain the image thereof,--she cannot do it, for it is\nthen clear to her that it would be, in that case, an act of the\nimagination, not the vision itself,--that is not in her power;\nand so it is with the supernatural things.  And it is from this\nit comes to pass that he in whom God works these graces despises\nhimself, and becomes more humble than he was ever before, for he\nsees that this is a gift of God, and that he can neither add to\nit nor take from it.  The love and the desire become greater of\nserving our Lord, who is so mighty that He can do that which is\nmore than our imagination can conceive here, as there are things\nwhich men, however learned they may be, can never know.\nBlessed for ever and ever be He who bestows this!  Amen.\n1. See Life, ch. xxiv. \u00a7 4.\n2. See Life, ch. xxv. \u00a7 18.\n3. See Life, ch. xxv. \u00a7 20, and ch. xxvii. \u00a7 1.\n4. See Life, ch. xxvi. \u00a7 5.\n5.

I give myself up to the Inquisition to try me,\nand examine my ways of going on, submitting myself to its\norders.'  The Inquisitor replied: 'Se\u00f1ora, the business of the\nInquisition is not to try the spirit, nor to examine ways of\nprayer, but to correct heretics.  Do you, then, commit your\nexperience to writing, in all simplicity and truth, and send it\nto the Father-Master Avila, who is a man of great spirituality\nand learning, and extremely conversant with matters of prayer;\nand when you shall have his answer, you may be sure there is\nnothing to be afraid of'\" (Jerome Gratian, Lucidario, cap.\u00a0iii.).\n6.

These interior things of the spirit are so difficult to\ndescribe, and, still more, in such a way as to be\nunderstood,--the more so as they pass quickly away,--that, if\nobedience did not help me, it would be a chance if I succeeded,\nespecially in such difficult things.  I implore you, my father,\nto take for granted that it is not in my mind to think this to be\ncorrect, for it may well be that I do not understand the matter;\nbut what I can assure you of is this, that I will speak of\nnothing I have not had experience of at times, and,\nindeed, often.\n2. I think it will please you, my father, if I begin by\ndiscussing that which is at the root of supernatural things; for\nthat which relates to devotion, tenderness, tears, and\nmeditations, which is in our power here to acquire by the help of\nour Lord, is understood.\n3. The first prayer of which I was conscious,--in my opinion,\nsupernatural,--so I call that which no skill or effort of ours,\nhowever much we labour, can attain to, though we should prepare\nourselves for it, and that preparation must be of great\nservice,--is a certain interior recollection [1] of which the\nsoul is sensible; the soul seems to have other senses within\nitself then, which bear some likeness to the exterior senses it\npossesses; and thus the soul, withdrawing into itself, seeks to\ngo away from the tumult of its outward senses, and accordingly it\ndrags them away with itself; for it closes the eyes on purpose\nthat it may neither see, nor hear, nor understand anything but\nthat whereon the soul is then intent, which is to be able to\nconverse with God alone.  In this prayer there is no suspension\nof the faculties and powers of the soul; it retains the full use\nof them; but the use of them is retained that they may be\noccupied with God.  This will be easily understood by him whom\nour Lord shall have raised to this state; but by him whom He has\nnot, not; at least, such a one will have need of many words\nand illustrations.\n4. Out of this recollection grow a certain quietude and inward\npeace most full of comfort; for the soul is in such a state that\nit does not seem to it that it wants anything; for even speaking\nwearies it,--I mean by this, vocal prayer and meditation; it\nwould do nothing but love.  This lasts some time, and even a\nlong time.\n5. Out of this prayer comes usually what is called a sleep of the\nfaculties; but they are not so absorbed nor so suspended as that\nit can be called a trance; nor is it altogether union.\n6. Sometimes, and even often, the soul is aware that the will\nalone is in union; and this it sees very clearly,--that is, it\nseems so to it.  The will is wholly intent upon God, and the soul\nsees that it has no power to rest on, or do, anything else; and\nat the same time the two other faculties are at liberty to attend\nto other matters of the service of God,--in a word, Martha and\nMary are together. [2]  I asked Father Francis [3] if this was a\ndelusion, for it made me stupid; and his reply was, that it\noften happened.\n7. When all the faculties of the soul are in union, it is a very\ndifferent state of things; for they can then do nothing whatever,\nbecause the understanding is as it were surprised.  The will\nloves more than the understanding knows; but the understanding\ndoes not know that the will loves, nor what it is doing, so as to\nbe able in any way to speak of it.  As to the memory, the soul, I\nthink, has none then, nor any power of thinking, nor are the\nsenses awake, but rather as lost, so that the soul may be the\nmore occupied with the object of its fruition: so it seems to me.\nThey are lost but for a brief interval; it passes quickly away.\nBy the wealth of humility, and other virtues and desires, left in\nthe soul after this may be learnt how great the blessing is that\nflows from this grace, but it cannot be told what it is; for,\nthough the soul applies itself to the understanding of it, it can\nneither understand nor explain it.  This, if it be real, is, in\nmy opinion, the greatest grace wrought by our Lord on this\nspiritual road,--at least, it is one of the greatest.\n8. Raptures and trance, in my opinion, are all one, only I am in\nthe habit of using the word trance instead of rapture, because\nthe latter word frightens people; and, indeed, the union of which\nI am speaking may also be called a trance.  The difference\nbetween union and trance is this, that the latter lasts longer\nand is more visible outwardly, because the breathing gradually\ndiminishes, so that it becomes impossible to speak or to open the\neyes; and though this very thing occurs when the soul is in\nunion, there is more violence in a trance for the natural warmth\nvanishes, I know not how, when the rapture is deep; and in all\nthese kinds of prayer there is more or less of this.  When it is\ndeep, as I was saying, the hands become cold, and sometimes stiff\nand straight as pieces of wood; as to the body, if the rapture\ncomes on when it is standing or kneeling, it remains so; [4] and\nthe soul is so full of the joy of that which our Lord is setting\nbefore it, that it seems to forget to animate the body, and\nabandons it.  If the rapture lasts, the nerves are made to\nfeel it.\n9. It seems to me that our Lord will have the soul know more of\nthat, the fruition of which it has, in a trance than in union,\nand accordingly in a rapture the soul receives most commonly\ncertain revelations of His Majesty, and the effects thereof on\nthe soul are great,--a forgetfulness of self, through the longing\nit has that God our Lord, who is so high, may be known and\npraised.  In my opinion, if the rapture be from God, the soul\ncannot fail to obtain a deep conviction of its own helplessness,\nand of its wretchedness and ingratitude, in that it has not\nserved Him who, of His own goodness only, bestows upon it graces\nso great; for the feeling and the sweetness are so high above all\nthings that may be compared therewith that, if the recollection\nof them did not pass away, all the satisfactions of earth would\nbe always loathsome to it; and hence comes the contempt for all\nthe things of the world.\n10. The difference between trance and transport [5] is this,--in\na trance the soul gradually dies to outward things, losing the\nsenses and living unto God.  A transport comes on by one sole act\nof His Majesty, wrought in the innermost part of the soul with\nsuch swiftness that it is as if the higher part thereof were\ncarried away, and the soul leaving the body.  Accordingly it\nrequires courage at first to throw itself into the arms of our\nLord, that He may take it whithersoever He will; for, until His\nMajesty establishes it in peace there whither He is pleased to\ntake it--by take it I mean the admitting of it to the knowledge\nof deep things--it certainly requires in the beginning to be\nfirmly resolved to die for Him, because the poor soul does not\nknow what this means--that is, at first.  The virtues, as it\nseems to me, remain stronger after this, for there is a growth in\ndetachment, and the power of God, who is so mighty, is the more\nknown, so that the soul loves and fears Him.  For so it is, He\ncarries away the soul, no longer in our power, as the true Lord\nthereof, which is filled with a deep sorrow for having offended\nHim, and astonishment that it ever dared to offend a Majesty so\ngreat, with an exceedingly earnest desire that none may\nhenceforth offend Him, and that all may praise Him.  This, I\nthink, must be the source of those very fervent desires for the\nsalvation of souls, and for some share therein, and for the due\npraising of God.\n11. The flight of the spirit--I know not how to call it--is a\nrising upwards from the very depths of the soul.  I remember only\nthis comparison, and I made use of it before, as you know, my\nfather, in that writing where these and other ways of prayer are\nexplained at length, [6] and such is my memory that I forget\nthings at once.  It seems to me that soul and spirit are one and\nthe same thing; but only as a fire, if it is great and ready for\nburning; so, like fire burning rapidly, the soul, in that\npreparation of itself which is the work of God, sends up a\nflame,--the flame ascends on high, but the fire thereof is the\nsame as that below, nor does the flame cease to be fire because\nit ascends: so here, in the soul, something so subtile and so\nswift, seems to issue from it, that ascends to the higher part,\nand goes thither whither our Lord wills.  I cannot go further\nwith the explanation; it seems a flight, and I know of nothing\nelse wherewith to compare it: I know that it cannot be mistaken,\nfor it is most evident when it occurs, and that it cannot\nbe hindered.\n12. This little bird of the spirit seems to have escaped out of\nthis wretchedness of the flesh, out of the prison of this body,\nand now, disentangled therefrom, is able to be the more intent on\nthat which our Lord is giving it.  The flight of the spirit is\nsomething so fine, of such inestimable worth, as the soul\nperceives it, that all delusion therein seems impossible, or\nanything of the kind, when it occurs.  It was afterwards that\nfear arose, because she who received this grace was so wicked;\nfor she saw what good reasons she had to be afraid of everything,\nthough in her innermost soul there remained an assurance and a\nconfidence wherein she was able to live, but not enough to make\nher cease from the anxiety she was in not to be deceived.\n13. By impetus I mean that desire which at times rushes into the\nsoul, without being preceded by prayer, and this is most\nfrequently the case; it is a sudden remembering that the soul is\naway from God, or of a word it has heard to that effect.\nThis remembering is occasionally so strong and vehement that the\nsoul in a moment becomes as if the reason were gone, just like a\nperson who suddenly hears most painful tidings of which he knew\nnot before, or is surprised; such a one seems deprived of the\npower of collecting his thoughts for his own comfort, and is as\none lost.  So is it in this state, except that the suffering\narises from this, that there abides in the soul a conviction that\nit would be well worth dying in it.  It seems that whatever the\nsoul then perceives does but increase its suffering, and that our\nLord will have its whole being find no comfort in anything, nor\nremember that it is His will that it should live: the soul seems\nto itself to be in great and indescribable loneliness, and\nabandoned of all, because the world, and all that is in it, gives\nit pain; and because it finds no companionship in any created\nthing, the soul seeks its Creator alone, and this it sees to be\nimpossible unless it dies; and as it must not kill itself, it is\ndying to die, and there is really a risk of death, and it sees\nitself hanging between heaven and earth, not knowing what to do\nwith itself.  And from time to time God gives it a certain\nknowledge of Himself, that it may see what it loses, in a way so\nstrange that no explanation of it is possible; and there is no\npain in the world--at least I have felt none--that is equal or\nlike unto this, for if it lasts but half an hour the whole body\nis out of joint, and the bones so racked, that I am not able to\nwrite with my hands: the pains I endure are most grievous. [7]\n14. But nothing of all this is felt till the impetus shall have\npassed away.  He to whom it comes has enough to do in enduring\nthat which is going on within him, nor do I believe that he would\nfeel if he were grievously tortured: he is in possession of all\nhis senses, can speak, and even observe; walk about he\ncannot,--the great blow of that love throws him down to the\nground.  If we were to die to have this, it would be of no use,\nfor it cannot be except when God sends it.  It leaves great\neffects and blessings in the soul.  Some learned men say that it\nis this, others that it is that, but no one condemns it.  The\nFather-Master d'Avila wrote to me and said it was good, and so\nsay all.  The soul clearly understands that it is a great grace\nfrom our Lord; were it to occur more frequently, life would not\nlast long.\n15. The ordinary impetus is, that this desire of serving God\ncomes on with a certain tenderness, accompanied with tears, out\nof a longing to depart from this land of exile; but as the soul\nretains its freedom, wherein it reflects that its living on is\naccording to our Lord's will, it takes comfort in that thought,\nand offers its life to Him, beseeching Him that it may last only\nfor His glory.  This done, it bears all.\n16. Another prayer very common is a certain kind of wounding; [8]\nfor it really seems to the soul as if an arrow were thrust\nthrough the heart, or through itself.  Thus it causes great\nsuffering, which makes the soul complain; but the suffering is so\nsweet, that it wishes it never would end.  The suffering is not\none of sense, neither is the wound physical; it is in the\ninterior of the soul, without any appearance of bodily pain; but\nas I cannot explain it except by comparing it with other pains, I\nmake use of these clumsy expressions,--for such they are when\napplied to this suffering.  I cannot, however, explain it in any\nother way.  It is, therefore, neither to be written of nor spoken\nof, because it is impossible for any one to understand it who has\nnot had experience of it,--I mean, how far the pain can go; for\nthe pains of the spirit are very different from those of earth.\nI gather, therefore, from this, that the souls in hell and\npurgatory suffer more than we can imagine, by considering these\npains of the body.\n17. At other times, this wound of love seems to issue from the\ninmost depth of the soul; great are the effects of it; and when\nour Lord does not inflict it, there is no help for it, whatever\nwe may do to obtain it; nor can it be avoided when it is His\npleasure to inflict it.  The effects of it are those longings\nafter God, so quick and so fine that they cannot be described and\nwhen the soul sees itself hindered and kept back from entering,\nas it desires, on the fruition of God, it conceives a great\nloathing for the body, on which it looks as a thick wall which\nhinders it from that fruition which it then seems to have entered\nupon within itself, and unhindered by the body.  It then\ncomprehends the great evil that has befallen us through the sin\nof Adam in robbing us of this liberty. [9]\n18. This prayer I had before the raptures and the great\nimpetuosities I have been speaking of.  I forgot to say that\nthese great impetuosities scarcely ever leave me, except through\na trance or great sweetness in our Lord, whereby He comforts the\nsoul, and gives it courage to live on for His sake.\n19. All this that I speak of cannot be the effect of the\nimagination; and I have some reasons for saying this, but it\nwould be wearisome to enter on them: whether it be good or not is\nknown to our Lord.  The effects thereof, and how it profits the\nsoul, pass all comprehension, as it seems to me.\n20. I see clearly that the Persons are distinct, as I saw it\nyesterday when you, my father, were talking to the Father\nProvincial; only I saw nothing, and heard nothing, as, my father,\nI have already told you.  But there is a strange certainty about\nit, though the eyes of the soul see nothing; and when the\npresence is withdrawn, that withdrawal is felt.  How it is, I\nknow not; but I do know very well that it is not an imagination,\nbecause I cannot reproduce the vision when it is over, even if I\nwere to perish in the effort; but I have tried to do so.  So is\nit with all that I have spoken of here, so far as I can see; for,\nas I have been in this state for so many years, I have been able\nto observe, so that I can say so with this confidence.  The truth\nis,--and you, my father, should attend to this,--that, as to the\nPerson who always speaks, I can certainly say which of Them He\nseems to me to be; of the others I cannot say so much.  One of\nThem I know well has never spoken.  I never knew why, nor do I\nbusy myself in asking more of God than He is pleased to give,\nbecause in that case, I believe, I should be deluded by Satan, at\nonce; nor will I ask now, because of the fear I am in.\n21. I think the First spoke to me at times; but as I do not\nremember that very well now, nor what it was that He spoke, I\nwill not venture to say so.  It is all written,--you, my father,\nknow where,--and more at large than it is here; I know not\nwhether in the same words or not. [10]  Though the Persons are\ndistinct in a strange way, the soul knows One only God.  I do not\nremember that our Lord ever seemed to speak to me but in His\nHuman Nature; and--I say it again--I can assure you that this is\nno imagination.\n22. What, my father, you say about the water, I know not; nor\nhave I heard where the earthly paradise is.  I have already said\nthat I cannot but listen to what our Lord tells me; I hear it\nbecause I cannot help myself; but, as for asking His Majesty to\nreveal anything to me, that is what I have never done.  In that\ncase, I should immediately think I was imagining things, and that\nI must be in a delusion of Satan.  God be praised, I have never\nbeen curious about things, and I do not care to know more than I\ndo. [11]  What I have learnt, without seeking to learn, as I have\njust said, has been a great trouble to me, though it has been the\nmeans, I believe, which our Lord made use of to save me, seeing\nthat I was so wicked; good people do not need so much to make\nthem serve His Majesty.\n23. I remember another way of prayer which I had before the one I\nmentioned first,--namely, a presence of God, which is not a\nvision at all.  It seems that any one, if he recommends himself\nto His Majesty, even if he only prays vocally, finds Him; every\none, at all times, can do this, if we except seasons of aridity.\nMay He grant I may not by my own fault lose mercies so great, and\nmay He have compassion on me!\n1.

I had begun to go to confession to a certain person [1] in the\ncity wherein I am at present staying, when he, though he had much\ngood will towards me, and always has had since he took upon\nhimself the charge of my soul, ceased to come here; and one\nnight, when I was in prayer, and thinking how he failed me, I\nunderstood that God kept him from coming because it was expedient\nfor me to treat of the affairs of my soul with a certain person\non the spot. [2]  I was distressed because I had to form new\nrelations--it might be he would not understand me, and would\ndisturb me--and because I had a great affection for him who did\nme this charity, though I was always spiritually content when I\nsaw or heard the latter preach; also, I thought it would not do\nbecause of his many occupations.  Our Lord said to me: \"I will\ncause him to hear and understand thee.  Make thyself known unto\nhim; it will be some relief to thee in thy troubles.\"  The latter\npart was addressed to me, I think, because I was then so worn out\nby the absence of God.  His Majesty also said that He saw very\nwell the trouble I was in; but it could not be otherwise while I\nlived in this land of exile: all was for my good; and he\ncomforted me greatly.  So it has been: he comforts me, and seeks\nopportunities to do so; he has understood me, and given me great\nrelief; he is a most learned and holy man.\n2. One day,--it was the Feast of the Presentation,--I was praying\nearnestly to God for a certain person, and thinking that after\nall the possession of property and of freedom was unfitting for\nthat high sanctity which I wished him to attain to; I reflected\non his weak health, and on the spiritual health which he\ncommunicated to souls; and I heard these words: \"He serves Me\ngreatly; but the great thing is to follow Me stripped of\neverything, as I was on the cross.  Tell him to trust in Me.\"\nThese last words were said because I thought he could not, with\nhis weak health, attain to such perfection.\n3. Once, when I was thinking of the pain it was to me to eat meat\nand do no penance, I understood that there was at times more of\nself-love in that feeling than of a desire for penance.\n4. Once, when I was in great distress because of my offences\nagainst God, He said to me: \"All thy sins in My sight are as if\nthey were not.  For the future, be strong; for thy troubles are\nnot over.\"\n5. One day, in prayer, I felt my soul in God in such a way that\nit seemed to me as if the world did not exist, I was so absorbed\nin Him.  He made me then understand that verse of the Magnificat,\n\"Et exultavit spiritus meus,\" so that I can never forget it.\n6. Once, when I was thinking how people sought to destroy this\nmonastery of the Barefooted Carmelites, and that they purposed,\nperhaps, to bring about the destruction of them all by degrees, I\nheard: \"They do purpose it; nevertheless, they will never see it\ndone, but very much the reverse.\"\n7. Once, in deep recollection, I was praying to God for\nEliseus; [3] I heard this: \"He is My true son; I will never fail\nhim,\" or to that effect; but I am not sure of the latter words.\n8. Having one day conversed with a person who had given up much\nfor God, and calling to mind that I had given up nothing for Him,\nand had never served Him in anything, as I was bound to do, and\nthen considering the many graces He had wrought in my soul, I\nbegan to be exceedingly weary; and our Lord said to me: \"Thou\nknowest of the betrothal between thee and Myself, and therefore\nall I have is thine; and so I give thee all the labours and\nsorrows I endured, and thou canst therefore ask of My Father as\nif they were thine.\"  Though I have heard that we are partakers\ntherein, [4] now it was in a way so different that it seemed as\nif I had become possessed of a great principality; for the\naffection with which He wrought this grace cannot be described.\nThe Father seemed to ratify the gift; and from that time forth I\nlook at our Lord's Passion in a very different light, as on\nsomething that belongs to me; and that gives me\ngreat comfort. [5]\n9. On the Feast of the Magdalene, when thinking of the great love\nI am bound to have for our Lord, according to the words He spoke\nto, me in reference to this Saint, and having great desires to\nimitate her, our Lord was very gracious unto me, and said, I was\nto be henceforward strong; for I had to serve Him more than I had\nhitherto done. [6]  He filled me with a desire not to die so\nsoon, that I might have the time to occupy myself therein; and I\nremained with a great resolution to suffer.\n10. On one occasion, I understood how our Lord was in all things,\nand how He was in the soul; and the illustration of a sponge\nfilled with water was suggested to me.\n11. When my brothers came,--and I owe so much to one of\nthem, [7]--I remained in conversation with him concerning his\nsoul and his affairs, which wearied and distressed me; and as I\nwas offering this up to our Lord, and thinking that I did it all\nbecause I was under obligations to him, I remembered that by our\nConstitutions [8] we are commanded to separate ourselves from our\nkindred, and I was set thinking whether I was under any\nobligation, our Lord said to me: \"No, My daughter; the\nregulations of the Order must be only in conformity with My law.\"\nThe truth is, that the end of the Constitutions is, that we are\nnot to be attached to our kindred; and to converse with them, as\nit seems to me, is rather wearisome, and it is painful to have\nanything to do with them.\n12. After Communion, on St. Augustine's Day, I understood, and,\nas it were, saw,--I cannot tell how, unless it was by an\nintellectual vision which passed rapidly away,--how the Three\nPersons of the most Holy Trinity, whom I have always imprinted in\nmy soul, are One.  This was revealed in a representation so\nstrange, and in a light so clear, that the impression made upon\nme was very different from that which I have by faith.  From that\ntime forth I have never been able to think of One of the Three\nDivine Persons without thinking of the Three; so that to-day,\nwhen I was considering how, the Three being One, the Son alone\ntook our flesh upon Him, our Lord showed me how, though They are\nOne, They are also distinct.  These are marvels which make the\nsoul desire anew to be rid of the hindrances which the body\ninterposes between it and the fruition of them.  Though this\npasses away in a moment, there remains a gain to the soul\nincomparably greater than any it might have made by meditation\nduring many years; and all without knowing how it happens.\n13. I have a special joy on the Feast of our Lady's Nativity.\nWhen this day was come, I thought it would be well to renew our\nvows; and thereupon I saw our Lady, by an illuminative vision;\nand it seemed as if we made them before her and that they were\npleasing unto her.  I had this vision constantly for some days,\nand our Lady was by me on my left hand.  One day, after\nCommunion, it seemed to me that my soul was really one with the\nmost Holy Body of our Lord, then present before me; and that\nwrought a great work and blessing in me.\n14. I was once thinking whether I was to be sent to reform a\ncertain monastery; [9] and, distressed at it, I heard: \"What art\nthou afraid of?  What canst thou lose?--only thy life, which thou\nhast so often offered to Me.  I will help thee.\"  This was in\nprayer, which was of such a nature as to ease my\nsoul exceedingly.\n15. Once, having a desire to render some service to our Lord, I\nconsidered that I could serve Him but poorly, and said to myself:\n\"Why, O Lord, dost Thou desire my works?\"  And He answered: \"To\nsee thy good will, My child.\"\n16. Once our Lord gave me light in a matter that I was very glad\nto understand, and I immediately forgot it, so that I was never\nable to call it again to mind; and so, when I was trying to\nremember it, I heard: \"Thou knowest now that I speak to thee from\ntime to time.  Do not omit to write down what I say; for, though\nit may not profit thee, it may be that it will profit others.\"\nAs I was thinking whether I, for my sins, had to be of use to\nothers, and be lost myself, He said to me: \"Have no fear.\"\n17. I was once recollected in that companionship which I ever\nhave in my soul, and it seemed to me that God was present therein\nin such a way that I remembered how St. Peter said: \"Thou art\nChrist, the Son of the living God;\" [10] for the living God was\nin my soul.  This is not like other visions, for it overpowers\nfaith; so that it is impossible to doubt of the indwelling of the\nTrinity in our souls, by presence, power, and essence.  To know\nthis truth is of the very highest gain; and as I stood amazed to\nsee His Majesty in a thing so vile as my soul, I heard: \"It is\nnot vile, My child, for it is made in My image.\" [11]  I also\nlearnt something of the reason why God delights in souls more\nthan in any other creatures: it is so subtile that, though the\nunderstanding quickly comprehended it, I cannot tell it.\n18. When I was in such distress, because of the troubles of our\nfather, [12] that I had no rest, and after Communion one day was\nmaking most earnestly my petition to our Lord that, as He had\ngiven him to me, I might not lose him, He said to me: \"Have\nno fear.\"\n19. Once, with that presence of the Three Persons which I have in\nmy soul, I was in light so clear that no doubt of the presence of\nthe true and living God was possible; and I then came to the\nknowledge of things which afterwards I could not speak of. One of\nthese things was, how the person of the Son only took human\nflesh.  I cannot, as I have just said, explain it at all; for\nsome of these things were wrought in the secret recesses of the\nsoul, and the understanding seems to grasp them only as one who\nis in his sleep, or half awake, thinks he comprehends what is\ntold him.  I was thinking how hard it was to remain alive, seeing\nthat it was living on that robbed us of that marvellous\ncompanionship; and so I said to myself: \"O Lord, show me some way\nwhereby I may bear this life!\"  He said unto me: \"Think, my\nchild, when life is over, thou canst not serve Me as thou art\nserving Me now, and eat for Me, and sleep for Me.  Whatsoever\nthou doest, let it be done for Me as if thou wert no longer\nliving, but I; for that is what St. Paul said.\" [13]\n20. Once, after Communion, I saw how His Father within our soul\naccepts the most Holy Body of Christ.  I have understood and seen\nhow the Divine Persons are there, and how pleasing is this\noffering of His Son, because He has His joy and delight in Him,\nso to speak, here on earth; for it is not the Humanity only that\nis with us in our, souls, but the Divinity as well, and thus is\nit so pleasing and acceptable unto Him, and gives us graces so\ngreat.  I understood also that He accepts the sacrifice, though\nthe priest be in sin; but then the grace of it is not\ncommunicated to his soul as it is to their souls who are in a\nstate of grace: not that the inflowings of grace, which proceed\nfrom this Communion wherein the Father accepts the sacrifice,\ncease to flow in their strength, but because of his fault who has\nto receive them; as it is not the fault of the sun that it does\nnot illumine a lump of pitch, when its rays strike it as it\nillumines a globe of crystal.  If I could now describe it, I\nshould be better understood; it is a great matter to know this,\nbecause there are grand secrets within us when we are at\nCommunion.  It is sad that these bodies of ours do not allow us\nto have the fruition thereof.\n21. During the Octave of All Saints, [14] I had two or three days\nof exceeding anguish, the result of my remembrance of my great\nsins, and I was also in great dread of persecutions, which had no\nfoundation except that great accusations were brought against me,\nand all my resolutions to suffer anything for God failed me:\nthough I sought to encourage myself, and made corresponding acts,\nand saw that all would be a great pain for me, it was to little\npurpose, for the fear never left me.  It was a sharp warfare.\nI came across a letter, in which my good father [15] had written\nthat St. Paul said that our God does not suffer us to be tempted\nbeyond our power to bear. [16]  This was a very great relief to\nme, but was not enough; yea, rather, on the next day I was in\ngreat distress at his absence, for I had no one to go to in this\ntrouble, for I seemed to be living in great loneliness.  And it\nadded to my grief to see that I now find no one but he who can\ncomfort me, and he must be more than ever away, which is a very\nsore trouble.\n22. The next night after this, reading in a book, I found another\nsaying of St. Paul, with which I began to be comforted; and being\nslightly recollected, I remained thinking how I had our Lord\nbefore present within me, so that I truly saw Him to be the\nliving God.  While thinking on this He spoke to me, and I saw Him\nin my inmost being, as it were beside my heart, in an\nintellectual vision; His words were: \"I am here, only I will have\nthee see how little thou canst do without Me.\"  I was on the\ninstant reassured, and my fears left me; and while at Matins that\nvery night our Lord Himself, in an intellectual vision so clear\nas to seem almost imaginary, laid Himself in my arms, as He is\npainted in the pictures of our Lady of Anguish. [17]  The vision\nmade me very much afraid, for it was so clear, and so close to\nme, that it made me think whether it was an illusion or not.\nHe said to me, \"Be not afraid of it, for the union of My Father\nwith thy soul is incomparably closer than this.\"  The vision has\nremained with me till now.  What I have said of our Lord\ncontinued more than a month: now it has left me.\n23. I was one night in great distress, because it was then a long\ntime since I had heard anything of my father; [18] and, moreover,\nhe was not well the last time he wrote to me.  However, my\ndistress was not so great as that I felt before, for I had hopes,\nand distress like that I never was in since; but still my anxiety\nhindered my prayer.  He appeared to me on the instant; it could\nnot have been the effect of imagination, for I saw a light within\nme, and himself coming by the way joyous, with a face all fair.\nIt must have been the light I saw that made his face fair, for\nall the saints in heaven seem so; and I considered whether it be\nthe light and splendour proceeding from our Lord that render them\nthus fair.  I heard this: \"Tell him to begin at once without\nfear, for the victory is his.\"\n24. One day, after he came, when I was at night giving thanks to\nour Lord for the many mercies He had given unto me, He said to\nme: \"O my child, what canst thou ask that I have not done?\"\n25. Our Lord said to me one day, in the monastery of Veas, that I\nwas to present my petition to Him, for I was His bride.\nHe promised to grant whatever I might ask of Him, and, as a\npledge, gave me a very beautiful ring, with a stone set in it\nlike an amethyst, but of a brilliancy very unlike, which He put\non my finger.  I write this to my own confusion, considering the\ngoodness of God, and my wretched life; for I have deserved hell.\nAh! my daughters, pray to God for me, and be devout to\nSt. Joseph, who can do much.  This folly I write . . . folly\nI write. . . .\n26. On the eve of St. Laurence, at Communion, I was so distracted\nand dissipated in mind, that I had no power over it, and began to\nenvy those who dwell in desert places; thinking that, as they see\nand hear nothing, they are exempt from distractions.  I heard\nthis: \"Thou art greatly deceived, My daughter; on the contrary,\nthe temptations of Satan are more violent there.  Have patience\nwhile life lasts, it cannot be helped.\"  While dwelling on this,\nI became suddenly recollected, and I saw a great light within me,\nso that I thought I was in another world, and my spirit found\nitself interiorly in a forest and in a garden of delights, which\nmade me remember those words of the Canticle: [19] \"Veniat\ndilectus meus in hortum suum.\"  I saw my Eliseus [20] there, not\nat all swarthy, but in strange beauty: around his head was a\ngarland of precious stones; a multitude of damsels went before\nhim with palms in their hands, all singing hymns of praise unto\nGod.  I did nothing but open my eyes, to see whether I could not\ndistract myself from the vision, but that failed to divert my\nattention; and I thought there was music also,--the singing of\nbirds and of angels,--which filled my soul with joy, though I did\nnot hear any.  My soul was in joy, and did not consider that\nthere was nobody else there.  I heard these words: \"He has\nmerited to be among you, and all this rejoicing which thou\nbeholdest will take place on the day he shall set aside for the\nhonour of My Mother; [21] and do thou make haste, if thou wouldst\nreach the place where he is.\"  This vision lasted more than an\nhour and a half.  In this respect--differently from my other\nvisions--I could not turn away from it, and it filled me with\ndelight.  The effect of the vision was a great affection for\nEliseus, and a more frequent thinking of him in that beauty.\nI have had a fear of its being a temptation, for work of the\nimagination it could not possibly be. [22]\n27. The day after the presentation of the Brief, [23] as I was in\nthe most eager expectation, which utterly disturbed me, so that I\ncould not even pray,--for I had been told that our father was in\ngreat straits because they would not let him come away, and that\nthere was a great tumult,--I heard these words: \"O woman of\nlittle faith, be quiet; everything is going on perfectly well.\"\nIt was the Feast of the Presentation of our Lady, in the year\n1575.  I resolved within myself, if our Lady obtained from her\nSon that we might see ourselves and our father free of these\nfriars, to ask him to order the solemn celebration of that feast\nevery year in our monasteries of the Barefooted Carmelites.\nWhen I made this resolution, I did not remember what I had heard\nin a former vision, that he would establish this solemnity.\nNow, in reading again this little paper, I think this must be the\nfeast referred to.

In that profound recollection I heard our\nLord say what I am now going to tell: I was to say to the\nBarefooted Fathers, as from Him, that they must strive to observe\nfour things; and that so long as they observed them, the Order\nwould increase more and more; and if they neglected them, they\nshould know that they were falling away from their first estate.\nThe first is, the superiors of the monasteries are to be of\none mind.\nThe second, even if they have many monasteries, to have but few\nfriars in each.\nThe third, to converse little with people in the world, and that\nonly for the good of their souls.\nThe fourth, to teach more by works than by words.\nThis happened in the year 1579; and because it is a great truth,\nI have put my name to it.\nTeresa de Jes\u00fas.\n1. See Life, ch. xxxviii. \u00a7 11.\n2. Psalm xxxviii. 3: \"Concaluit cor meum intra me.\"\nRelation XI.\nWritten from Palencia in May 1581, and Addressed to Don Alonzo\nVelasquez, Bishop of Osma, Who Had Been, When Canon of Toledo,\nOne of the Saint's Confessors. [1]\nJesus.\n1. Oh, that I could clearly explain to your Lordship the peace\nand quiet my soul has found! for it has so great a certainty of\nthe fruition of God, that it seems to be as if already in\npossession, [2] though the joy is withheld.  I am as one to whom\nanother has granted by deed a large revenue, into the enjoyment\nand use of which he is to come at a certain time, but until then\nhas nothing but the right already given him to the revenue.\nIn gratitude for this, my soul would abstain from the joy of it,\nbecause it has not deserved it; it wishes only to serve Him, even\nif in great suffering, and at times it thinks it would be very\nlittle if, till the end of the world, it had to serve Him who has\ngiven it this right; for, in truth, it is in some measure no\nlonger subject, as before, to the miseries of this world; though\nit suffers more, it seems as if only the habit were struck, for\nmy soul is, as it were, in a fortress with authority, and\naccordingly does not lose its peace.  Still, this confidence does\nnot remove from it its great fear of offending God, nor make it\nless careful to put away every hindrance to His service, yea,\nrather, it is more careful than before.  But it is so forgetful\nof its own interests as to seem, in some measure, to have lost\nitself, so forgetful of self is it in this.  Everything is\ndirected to the honour of God, to the doing of His will more and\nmore, and the advancement of His glory.\n2. Though this be so, yet, in all that relates to health and the\ncare of the body, it seems to me that I am more careful than I\nwas, that I mortify myself less in my food, and do fewer\npenances: it is not so with the desires I had; they seem to be\ngreater.  All this is done that I may be the better able to serve\nGod in other things, for I offer to Him very often, as a great\nsacrifice, the care I take of my body, and that wearies me much,\nand I try it sometimes in acts of mortification; but, after all,\nthis cannot be done without losing health, and I must not neglect\nwhat my superiors command.  Herein, and in the wish for health,\nmuch self-love also must insinuate itself; but, as it seems to\nme, I feel that it would give me more pleasure, and it gave me\nmore pleasure when I was strong, to do penance, for, at least, I\nseemed to be doing something, and was giving a good example, and\nI was free from the vexation which arises out of the fact that I\nam not serving God at all.  Your Lordship will see what it will\nbe best to do in the matter.\n3. The imaginary visions have ceased, but the intellectual vision\nof the Three Persons and of the Sacred Humanity seems ever\npresent, and that, I believe, is a vision of a much higher kind;\nand I understand now, so I think, that the visions I had came\nfrom God, because they prepared my soul for its present state;\nthey were given only because I was so wretched and so weak: God\nled me by the way which He saw was necessary; but they are, in my\nopinion, of great worth when they come from God.\n4. The interior locutions have not left me, for, whenever it is\nnecessary, our Lord gives me certain directions; and now, in\nPalencia, were it not for these, there would have been committed\na great blunder, though not a sin. [3]\n5. The acts and desires do not seem to be so vigorous as they\nused to be, for, though they are great, I have one much greater\nto see the will of God accomplished and His glory increased; for\nas the soul is well aware that His Majesty knoweth what is\nexpedient herein, and is so far removed from all self-seeking,\nthese acts and desires quickly end, and, as it seems to me, have\nno strength.  Hence the fear I have at times though without\ndisquietude and pain as formerly, that my soul is dulled, and\nthat I am doing nothing, because I can do no penance; acts of\ndesire for suffering, for martyrdom, and of the vision of God,\nhave no strength in them, and, most frequently, I cannot make\nthem.  I seem to live only for eating and drinking, and avoiding\npain in everything; and yet this gives me none, except that\nsometimes, as I said before, I am afraid that this is a delusion;\nbut I cannot believe it, because so far as I can see, I am not\nunder the sway of any strong attachment to any created thing, not\neven to all the bliss of heaven, but only to the love of God; and\nthis does not grow less,--on the contrary, I believe it is\ngrowing, together with the longing that all men may serve Him.\n6. But, for all this, one thing amazes me: I have not the\nfeelings I had formerly, so strong and so interior, which\ntormented me when I saw souls go to their ruin, and when I used\nto think I had offended God.  I cannot have these feelings now,\nthough I believe my desire that God be not sinned against is not\nless than it was.\n7. Your Lordship must consider that in all this, in my present as\nwell as in my previous state, I can do no more, and that it is\nnot in my power to serve Him better: I might do so, if I were not\nso wicked.  I may say, also, that if I were now to make great\nefforts to wish to die, I could not, nor can I make the acts I\nused to make, nor feel the pains I felt for having offended God,\nnor the great fears I had for so many years when I thought I was\nunder a delusion: and accordingly, I have no need of learned men,\nor of speaking to anybody at all, only to satisfy myself that I\nam going the right road now, and whether I can do anything.\nI have consulted certain persons on this point, with whom I had\ntaken counsel on the others, with Fra Dominic [i.e., Ba\u00f1es], the\nMaster Medina, and certain members of the Society.  I will be\nsatisfied with the answer which you, my Lord, may give me,\nbecause of the great trust I have in your Lordship.  Consider it\ncarefully, for the love of God!  Neither do I cease to learn that\ncertain souls of people connected with me when they died are in\nheaven: of others I learn nothing.  Oh, in what solitude I find\nmyself when I consider that the comparison of which I spoke to\nyou, concerning the return from Egypt, does not apply to the\nchild at my mother's breast. [4]\n8. I am at peace within; and my likings and dislikings have so\nlittle power to take from me the Presence of the Three Persons,\nof which, while it continues, it is so impossible to doubt, that\nI seem clearly to know by experience what is recorded by\nSt. John, that God will make His dwelling in the soul: [5] and\nnot only by grace, but because He will have the soul feel that\npresence, and it brings with it so many blessings, particularly\nthis, that there is no need to run after reflections to learn\nthat God is there.  This is almost always the state I am in,\nexcept when my great infirmities oppress me.  Sometimes, God will\nhave me suffer without any inward comfort; but my will never\nswerves--not even in its first movements--from the will of God.\nThis resignation to His will is so efficacious, that I desire\nneither life nor death, except for some moments, when I long to\nsee God; and then the Presence of the Three Persons becomes so\ndistinct as to relieve the pain of the absence, and I wish to\nlive--if such be His good pleasure--to serve Him still longer.\nAnd if I might help, by my prayers, to make but one soul love Him\nmore, and praise Him, and that only for a short time, I think\nthat of more importance than to dwell in glory.\nThe unworthy servant and daughter of your Lordship,\nTeresa de Jes\u00fas.\n1. This Relation is usually printed among the letters of the\nSaint, and Don Vicente did not change the practice, assigning as\nhis reason the Saint's reference in \u00a7 4 to certain transactions\nin which she was engaged.  The letter is the 333rd (336th in the\nsecond edition), and the 4th of vol. ii., ed. Doblado, and is\nprobably the latest account of the state of her soul, for she\ndied on October 4 in the following\u00a0year.\n2. See Inner Fortress, vii. ch. ii.\n3.
