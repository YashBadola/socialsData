{"text": "\u00a71. \"Cum autem sublatus fuerit ab oculis...\" \u2014 When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shown by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding something.\n\u00a72. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\n\u00a77. In the practice of the use of language (2) one party calls out the words, the other acts on them. In instruction in the language the following process will occur: the learner names the objects; that is, he utters the word when the teacher points to the stone.\u2014And there will be this simpler exercise: the teacher repeats the words after the teacher\u2014both of these being processes resembling language.\n\u00a723. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n\u00a743. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n\u00a767. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way.\u2014And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n\u00a7109. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n\u00a7309. What is your aim in philosophy?\u2014To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}

The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.\n4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means-just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.\n5.
