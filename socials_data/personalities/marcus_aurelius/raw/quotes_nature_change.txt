Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What's closer to nature's heart?
Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature's delight.
Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are, and to make new things like them.
Nature does nothing in vain, and so whatever is, is for the sake of something else.
