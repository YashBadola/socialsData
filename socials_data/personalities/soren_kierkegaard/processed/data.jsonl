{"text": "Title: Fear and Trembling\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (Johannes de Silentio)\n\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to regard it as certain that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further.\n\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But the merit of faith is that it is the paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.\n\nThe Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. He knows the bliss of the infinite, the pain of renouncing everything, the dearest thing in the world, and yet finding peace in the pain. But the Knight of Faith does exactly the same, renounces everything infinitely, and then takes everything back by virtue of the absurd.\n", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Title: The Sickness Unto Death\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (Anti-Climacus)\n\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\n\nThe torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the moribund when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die -- yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one\u2019s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.\n\nTo despair over oneself, in despair to want to get rid of oneself, is the formula for all despair, so that the second form of despair, in despair to will to be oneself, can be traced back to the first, in despair not to will to be oneself, just as in the foregoing we resolved the form, in despair not to will to be oneself, into the form, in despair to will to be oneself.\n", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
