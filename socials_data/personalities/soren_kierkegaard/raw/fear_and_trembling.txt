Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without humble regard for the individual to assume that he has doubted everything, since otherwise it is a curious statement for him to make, that he has gone further. This movement they have all made, or so they say, and so it must be true...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual sets himself apart as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them. This is something that Hegel should not have concealed, for, after all, he was acquainted with Greek philosophy.

But Abraham is the Knight of Faith...
