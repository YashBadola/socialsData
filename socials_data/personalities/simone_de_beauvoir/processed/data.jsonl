{"text": "THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY\nPart I: Ambiguity and Freedom\nThe continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. Indeed, man knows that he is mortal, but he does not know it because he dies; he knows it because he is the living being who knows that he is dying. The beasts know nothing of death, although they die; they do not negate their being. Man, on the contrary, carries his negation within himself. And what is this negation? It is a presence. It is a presence of a lack.\nTo exist is to make oneself a lack of being; it is to cast oneself into the world. Those who have tried to define man by his pure positivity have failed. They have wanted to make him a solid thing, a stone, a statue. But man is not a stone, he is a movement, a project. He is a freedom which creates itself by its choices.\nBut if man is free to define himself, does this mean that he can do anything? Does it mean that every action is justifiable? Certainly not. Existentialism does not offer a justification for every caprice. On the contrary, it places upon man the heaviest of burdens: the burden of his own freedom. For if I am free, I am responsible for my actions, and in choosing for myself, I choose for all mankind.\nThis is the ambiguity of the human condition. We are at once a sovereign consciousness and an object in the world. We are free, yet we are situated. We are individuals, yet we are bound to others. We are mortal, yet we project ourselves into the future as if we were eternal.\nFrom the very beginning, existentialism defined itself as a philosophy of ambiguity. It was by affirming the irreducible character of ambiguity that Kierkegaard opposed himself to Hegel, and it is by ambiguity that, in our own generation, Sartre, in Being and Nothingness, fundamentally defined man, that being whose being is not to be, that subjectivity which realizes itself only as a presence in the world, that engaged freedom, that surging of the for-itself which is immediately given for others.\nBut it is also claimed that existentialism is a philosophy of the absurd and of despair. It encloses man in a sterile anguish, in an empty subjectivity. It is incapable of furnishing him with any principle of action. Let us try to understand why these objections are raised and whether they are valid.\nThe notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave no room for ethics; it is because man's condition is ambiguous that he seeks, through failure and outrageousness, to save his existence.\nThus, to will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person concrete action to be achieved. But the others are separate, distinct, and often opposed. Here the tragedy of the human situation appears. We must make choices. We must take sides. To abstain is still to choose. And our choice will always involve a risk.\nThere is no recipe for living. There is no guidebook that tells us what to do in every situation. We must invent our own law. But this does not mean that we are alone. We are in the world with others, and our freedom depends on theirs. As long as there is oppression, as long as there is slavery, as long as there is injustice, our own freedom is threatened. We cannot be truly free unless everyone is free.\nThis is why the existentialist ethics is an ethics of engagement. We must engage ourselves in the world. We must take action. We must fight for freedom. And we must do so with the full knowledge that we may fail. But it is in the very act of striving that we find our dignity and our meaning.\nThe man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.\nIt is true that the freedom of others limits me; but it is also true that it is this freedom which gives my own freedom its meaning. I can only project myself into the future if there are other men who confirm my project and who take it up after me. If I were alone in the world, my actions would have no significance. I would be like a child playing a game that no one else understands. But because there are others, my actions have a weight, a resonance. They echo in the world and they transform it.\nTherefore, let us not be afraid of our freedom. Let us not try to escape it by taking refuge in ready-made values or in the comfort of conformity. Let us accept the challenge of our existence. Let us assume the ambiguity of our condition. And let us strive, with all our strength, to create a world where freedom is possible for all.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity_excerpt.txt"}
