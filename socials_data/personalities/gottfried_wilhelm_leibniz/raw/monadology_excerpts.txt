The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple meaning without parts. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for a composite is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.

Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor figure nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things. No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be perished by natural means.

For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can begin by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the combination of several; and as it can neither begin nor end by natural means, it can only begin by creation and end by annihilation; whereas that which is composite begins or ends by parts.

There is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be excited, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of composites, in which there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.

However, the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ in quality, there would be absolutely no means of perceiving any change in things. For what is in the composite can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each part of space would always receive only the equivalent of what it had had before, and one state of things would be indistinguishable from another.

Thus, every Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality.

I assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each. It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.

But, besides the principle of the change, there must be a particular series of the changes, which constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature and variety of the simple substances. This particular series of changes should involve a multiplicity in the unit or in that which is simple. For, as every natural change takes place gradually, something changes and something remains; and consequently, in the simple substance there must be a plurality of affections and relations, although there are no parts.

This shifting state, which involves and represents a multitude in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in what follows. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies.

If we wish to discover how we compare with the Monads, we must consider that there are two states of the Monad: Perception and Appetition. Appetition is the tendency of the internal principle to pass from one perception to another.
