{"text": "INTRODUCTION\nFor a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially to women; and it is not new. Enough ink has been spilled in the quarreling over feminism, now practically over, and perhaps we should say no more about it. It is still talked about, however, for the voluminous nonsense uttered during the last century seems to have done little to illuminate the problem. After all, is there a problem? And if so, what is it? Are there women, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: \"Even in Russia women still are women\"; and other erudite persons - sometimes the very same - say with a sigh: \"Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.\" One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should, what place they occupy in this world, what their place should be. \"What has become of women?\" was asked recently in an ephemeral magazine. But first we must ask: what is a woman? \"Tota mulier in utero\", says one, \"woman is a womb\". But in speaking of certain women, connoisseurs declare that they are not women, although they are equipped with a uterus like the rest. All female humans are not women. One must apparently participate in that mysterious and threatened reality known as femininity. Is this attribute something secreted by the ovaries? Or is it a Platonic essence, a product of the philosophic imagination? Is a rustling petticoat enough to bring it down to earth? Although some women try zealously to incarnate this essence, it is hardly patent to the senses. It is frequently described in vague and dazzling terms that seem to have been borrowed from the vocabulary of the seers, and indeed in the times of St. Thomas it appeared to be an essence as surely defined as the somniferous virtue of the poppy. But conceptualism has lost ground. The biological and social sciences no longer admit the existence of unchangeably fixed entities that determine given characteristics, such as those ascribed to woman, the Jew, or the Negro. Science regards any characteristic as a reaction dependent in part upon a situation. If today femininity no longer exists, then it never did exist. But does the word woman, then, have no specific content? This is stoutly affirmed by those who hold to the philosophy of the enlightenment, of rationalism, of nominalism; women, to them, are merely the human beings that are arbitrarily designated by the word woman. Many American women particularly are prepared to think that there is no longer any place for woman as such; if a backward individual still takes herself for a woman, her friends advise her to be psychoanalyzed and thus get rid of this obsession. In regard to a work, Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, which in other respects has its irritating features, Dorothy Parker has written: \"I cannot be just to books which treat of woman as woman ... My idea is that all of us, men as well as women, should be regarded as human beings.\" But nominalism is a rather inadequate doctrine, and the antifemininists have had no trouble in showing that women simply are not men. Surely woman is, like man, a human being; but such a declaration is abstract. The fact is that every concrete human being is always a singular, separate individual. To decline to accept such notions as the eternal feminine, the black soul, the Jewish character, is not to deny that Jews, Negroes, women exist today - this denial does not represent a liberation for those concerned, but rather a flight from reality. Some years ago a well-known woman writer refused to permit her portrait to appear in a series of photographs especially dedicated to women writers. \"I wish to be counted among the writers, not among the women,\" she said. But can this be done? The truth is that while she is a writer, she is also a woman; and that this fact is to be taken into account. To describe a woman is not to describe a woman writer or a woman lawyer or a woman aviator, but rather to describe the condition of womanhood itself.\n...\nOne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would never grasp himself as a sexually differentiated being. If the little girl were brought up by a distinctively male society, she would be raised as a girl, but she would never know what it meant to be a woman. The child is not a woman; she is a female, but the significance of this fact is not revealed to her at the beginning of her life. It is revealed to her gradually.\n...\nTHE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY\nThe man who finds himself cast into the world has no other destiny than to will himself free. But this freedom is not a given; it is a conquest. He must conquer it across the thickness of the world and against the resistance of things and other men. But he cannot save himself alone; he must save himself with others.\nTo will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person concrete action to be achieved. But the others are separate, distinct, and often opposed. How can I will the freedom of this one without infringing on the freedom of that one?\nThe ambiguity of the human condition is that we are at once a freedom which makes itself and a thing which is made. We are a subjectivity which reveals the world and an object in the world. We are a project which transcends the present toward the future, and we are a facticity which is anchored in the past. We are a sovereign consciousness and a body subject to the laws of nature.\nThe fundamental ambiguity of the human condition is that man is the unique being whose being is effectively to be, that is, who has to make himself be what he is. But this being is also a being who is what he is, that is, who is defined by his situation, his past, his body, his environment.\nExistentialism is defined by the fact that it affirms the primacy of existence over essence. This means that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world \u2013 and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it.\nLife is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.\nIn order for the artist to have a world to express he must first be situated in this world, oppressed or oppressing, resigned or rebellious, a man among men. But at the heart of his existence he finds the exigency which is common to all men; he must conquer his existence.\nIt is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.", "source": "works.txt"}
