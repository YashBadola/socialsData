{"text": "DIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\n...\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\n...\nMy sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's eyrie is built high up on the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality and seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my booty home. And this booty is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace. Then I live as one already dead. I immerse myself in the shadowy world of the past, specifically the Greek past. There I find rest for my weary spirit, there I forget the present and its petty cares.\n...\nThe Rotation Method\nPeople with great experience in life maintain that it is very difficult to forget, and it is also very difficult to remember. I should say that it is very difficult to remember and very difficult to forget, especially when one is forced to do so. The art of remembering and forgetting is the art of existing.\n...\nMarry, and you will regret it. Do not marry, and you will also regret it. Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Whether you marry or you do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that. Laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Whether you laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that. Believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that. Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. Whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.\nVictor Eremita", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age has arranged a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. My intention is not to hold a clearance sale; on the contrary, it is to prove that there is something which cannot be bought, and that this something is the only thing which is worth buying.\n...\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the particular individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\n...\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)\u2014or else there is no faith at all, but no faith has never existed, because it has always existed.\n...\nAbraham is called the father of the faith, and it is to him that I shall constantly refer. He acts by virtue of the absurd, for it is precisely absurd that he as the particular is higher than the universal. He acts by virtue of the absurd, for it is precisely absurd that the single individual is higher than the universal.\nJohannes de Silentio", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
