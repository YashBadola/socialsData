"The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair."

"To have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him."

"Despair is the sickness unto death."

"The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and is not able to die."

"Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self."
