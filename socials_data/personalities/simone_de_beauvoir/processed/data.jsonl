{"text": "The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds always a duality: the One and the Other. But what is peculiar to the situation of woman is that she has been defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute\u2014she is the Other.\nThis definition is not a natural fact. One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of others can establish an individual as an Other.\nThroughout history, women have been relegated to the sphere of immanence\u2014to the repetitive, the maintenance of life, the stagnant\u2014while men have claimed the sphere of transcendence, of projects, of changing the world. This is the source of the conflict. For a human being is not a static entity; a human being is a becoming. To force half of humanity into a state of stagnation is a crime against the spirit. It forces woman to live in bad faith, to accept her objectification as a destiny. Liberation requires that woman reclaim her status as a Subject, that she engage in projects that transcend her situation, and that man recognize her as a peer, not a possession.", "source": "on_the_other.txt"}
{"text": "The fundamental ambiguity of the human condition is that man is both a subject and an object. He is a sovereign consciousness, a freedom that projects itself into the world, yet he is also a thing among things, crushed by the brutality of the factitious. This duality is not a mistake or a curse; it is the very texture of our existence. To try to flee it\u2014either by reducing oneself to pure interiority or by losing oneself in the object-world\u2014is an act of bad faith.\nTrue ethics begins when we accept this ambiguity. We must assume our freedom, not as a given static property, but as a constant movement of transcendence. But my freedom is not solitary. I cannot genuinely will myself free unless I also will the freedom of others. The oppressor who believes himself sovereign is a slave to his own tyranny, for he requires the recognition of those he dehumanizes.\nThus, to exist authentically is to cast oneself into the world with the realization that the future is open. We are not determined by our past, nor by our biological nature. We are what we make of ourselves. But this making happens in a situation, a context shared with other freedoms. To deny the freedom of another is to obscure the very condition that makes my own freedom possible. We must face the void, the lack of pre-ordained meaning, and create our values through action.", "source": "existential_ambiguity.txt"}
{"text": "My Dear Sartre,\nI have been thinking a great deal about our conversation at the Caf\u00e9 de Flore yesterday regarding the responsibility of the intellectual. You argue, with that characteristic absolutism of yours, that to not choose is still a choice. Of course, I agree in principle. We are condemned to be free. But I worry that you sometimes underestimate the weight of the *situation*.\nWhen we look at the young student who came to you for advice during the war\u2014torn between staying with his mother or joining the Free French\u2014you told him: \"You are free, choose, that is to say, invent.\" This is true, philosophically. But practically? The anguish of that choice is not merely an intellectual puzzle; it is a tearing of the self.\nI am writing a new piece on the ambiguity of political action. It seems to me that we often dirty our hands not because we want to, but because the world itself is dirty. To seek a purity of action is to wish to be an angel, and as Pascal said, he who wishes to play the angel plays the beast. We must accept that our actions will have consequences we did not intend, and that sometimes, to do right by one, we must do wrong by another. This does not absolve us; it only makes the burden of freedom heavier.\nI shall be working late tonight. The air in Paris is heavy with the coming storm.\nYours,\nCastor", "source": "letter_to_sartre.txt"}
