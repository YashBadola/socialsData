{"text": "The sickness unto death is despair. But despair is not a simple phenomenon; on the contrary, it is the most dialectical of all sicknesses.\nTo be a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.\nThe formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.\nDespair is the disrelation in a relation that relates itself to itself. The human being is a spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}

If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world\u2026\nThe knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
