CHAPTER I.
HOW WELLINGBOROUGH REDBURN’S TASTE FOR THE SEA WAS BORN AND BRED IN HIM


“Wellingborough, as you are going to sea, suppose you take this
shooting-jacket of mine along; it’s just the thing—take it, it will
_save_ the expense of another. You see, it’s quite warm; fine long
skirts, stout horn buttons, and plenty of pockets.”

Out of the goodness and simplicity of his heart, thus spoke my elder
brother to me, upon the _eve_ of my departure for the seaport.

“And, Wellingborough,” he added, “since we are both short of money, and
you want an outfit, and I _Have_ none to _give,_ you may as well take
my fowling-piece along, and sell it in New York for what you can
get.—Nay, take it; it’s of no use to me now; I can’t find it in powder
any more.”

I was then but a boy. Some time previous my mother had removed from New
York to a pleasant village on the Hudson River, where we lived in a
small house, in a quiet way. Sad disappointments in several plans which
I had sketched for my future life; the necessity of doing something for
myself, united to a naturally roving disposition, had now conspired
within me, to send me to sea as a sailor.

For months previous I had been poring over old New York papers,
delightedly perusing the long columns of ship advertisements, all of
which possessed a strange, romantic charm to me. Over and over again I
devoured such announcements as the following:

FOR BREMEN.

_The coppered and copper-fastened brig Leda, having nearly completed
her cargo, will sail for the above port on Tuesday the twentieth of
May.
For freight or passage apply on board at Coenties Slip.
_


To my young inland imagination every word in an advertisement like
this, suggested volumes of thought.

A _brig!_ The very word summoned up the idea of a black, sea-worn
craft, with high, cozy bulwarks, and rakish masts and yards.

_Coppered and copper-fastened!_ That fairly smelt of the salt water!
How different such vessels must be from the wooden, one-masted,
green-and-white-painted sloops, that glided up and down the river
before our house on the bank.

_Nearly completed her cargo!_ How momentous the announcement;
suggesting ideas, too, of musty bales, and cases of silks and satins,
and filling me with contempt for the vile deck-loads of hay and lumber,
with which my river experience was familiar.

_Will sail on Tuesday the 20th of May-and_ the newspaper bore date the
fifth of the month! Fifteen whole days beforehand; think of that; what
an important voyage it must be, that the time of sailing was fixed upon
so long beforehand; the river sloops were not used to make such
prospective announcements.

_For freight or passage apply on board!_ Think of going on board a
coppered and copper-fastened brig, and taking passage for Bremen! And
who could be going to Bremen? No one but foreigners, doubtless; men of
dark complexions and jet-black whiskers, who talked French.

_Coenties Slip._ Plenty more brigs and any quantity of ships must be
lying there. Coenties Slip must be somewhere near ranges of
grim-looking warehouses, with rusty iron doors and shutters, and tiled
roofs; and old anchors and chain-cable piled on the walk. Old-fashioned
coffeehouses, also, much abound in that neighborhood, with sunburnt
sea-captains going in and out, smoking cigars, and talking about
Havanna, London, and Calcutta.

All these my imaginations were wonderfully assisted by certain shadowy
reminiscences of wharves, and warehouses, and shipping, with which a
residence in a seaport during early childhood had supplied me.

Particularly, I remembered standing with my father on the wharf when a
large ship was getting under way, and rounding the head of the pier. I
remembered the _yo heave ho!_ of the sailors, as they just showed their
woolen caps above the high bulwarks. I remembered how I thought of
their crossing the great ocean; and that that very ship, and those very
sailors, so near to me then, would after a time be actually in Europe.

Added to these reminiscences my father, now dead, had several times
crossed the Atlantic on business affairs, for he had been an importer
in Broad-street. And of winter evenings in New York, by the
well-remembered sea-coal fire in old Greenwich-street, he used to tell
my brother and me of the monstrous waves at sea, mountain high; of the
masts bending like twigs; and all about Havre, and Liverpool, and about
going up into the ball of St. Paul’s in London. Indeed, during my early
life, most of my thoughts of the sea were connected with the land; but
with fine old lands, full of mossy cathedrals and churches, and long,
narrow, crooked streets without sidewalks, and lined with strange
houses. And especially I tried hard to think how such places must look
of rainy days and Saturday afternoons; and whether indeed they did have
rainy days and Saturdays there, just as we did here; and whether the
boys went to school there, and studied geography, and wore their shirt
collars turned over, and tied with a black ribbon; and whether their
papas allowed them to wear boots, instead of shoes, which I so much
disliked, for boots looked so manly.

As I grew older my thoughts took a larger flight, and I frequently fell
into long reveries about distant voyages and travels, and thought how
fine it would be, to be able to talk about remote and barbarous
countries; with what reverence and wonder people would regard me, if I
had just returned from the coast of Africa or New Zealand; how dark and
romantic my sunburnt cheeks would look; how I would bring home with me
foreign clothes of a rich fabric and princely make, and wear them up
and down the streets, and how grocers’ boys would turn back their heads
to look at me, as I went by. For I very well remembered staring at a
man myself, who was pointed out to me by my aunt one Sunday in Church,
as the person who had been in Stony Arabia, and passed through strange
adventures there, all of which with my own eyes I had read in the book
which he wrote, an arid-looking book in a pale yellow cover.

“See what big eyes he has,” whispered my aunt, “they got so big,
because when he was almost dead with famishing in the desert, he all at
once caught sight of a date tree, with the ripe fruit hanging on it.”

Upon this, I stared at him till I thought his eyes were really of an
uncommon size, and stuck out from his head like those of a lobster. I
am sure my own eyes must have magnified as I stared. When church was
out, I wanted my aunt to take me along and follow the traveler home.
But she said the constables would take us up, if we did; and so I never
saw this wonderful Arabian traveler again. But he long haunted me; and
several times I dreamt of him, and thought his great eyes were grown
still larger and rounder; and once I had a vision of the date tree.

In course of time, my thoughts became more and more prone to dwell upon
foreign things; and in a thousand ways I sought to gratify my tastes.
We had several pieces of furniture in the house, which had been brought
from Europe. These I examined again and again, wondering where the wood
grew; whether the workmen who made them still survived, and what they
could be doing with themselves now.

Then we had several oil-paintings and rare old engravings of my
father’s, which he himself had bought in Paris, hanging up in the
dining-room.

Two of these were sea-pieces. One represented a fat-looking, smoky
fishing-boat, with three whiskerandoes in red caps, and their browsers
legs rolled up, hauling in a seine. There was high French-like land in
one corner, and a tumble-down gray lighthouse surmounting it. The waves
were toasted brown, and the whole picture looked mellow and old. I used
to think a piece of it might taste good.

The other represented three old-fashioned French men-of-war with high
castles, like pagodas, on the bow and stern, such as you see in
Froissart; and snug little turrets on top of the mast, full of little
men, with something undefinable in their hands. All three were sailing
through a bright-blue sea, blue as Sicily skies; and they were leaning
over on their sides at a fearful angle; and they must have been going
very fast, for the white spray was about the bows like a snow-storm.

Then, we had two large green French portfolios of colored prints, more
than I could lift at that age. Every Saturday my brothers and sisters
used to get them out of the corner where they were kept, and spreading
them on the floor, gaze at them with never-failing delight.

They were of all sorts. Some were pictures of Versailles, its
masquerades, its drawing-rooms, its fountains, and courts, and gardens,
with long lines of thick foliage cut into fantastic doors and windows,
and towers and pinnacles. Others were rural scenes, full of fine skies,
pensive cows standing up to the knees in water, and shepherd-boys and
cottages in the distance, half concealed in vineyards and vines.

And others were pictures of natural history, representing rhinoceroses
and elephants and spotted tigers; and above all there was a picture of
a great whale, as big as a ship, stuck full of harpoons, and three
boats sailing after it as fast as they could fly.

Then, too, we had a large library-case, that stood in the hall; an old
brown library-case, tall as a small house; it had a sort of basement,
with large doors, and a lock and key; and higher up, there were glass
doors, through which might be seen long rows of old books, that had
been printed in Paris, and London, and Leipsic. There was a fine
library edition of the Spectator, in six large volumes with gilded
backs; and many a time I gazed at the word _“London”_ on the
title-page. And there was a copy of D’Alembert in French, and I
wondered what a great man I would be, if by foreign travel I should
ever be able to read straight along without stopping, out of that book,
which now was a riddle to every one in the house but my father, whom I
so much liked to hear talk French, as he sometimes did to a servant we
had.

That servant, too, I used to gaze at with wonder; for in answer to my
incredulous cross-questions, he had over and over again assured me,
that he had really been born in Paris. But this I never entirely
believed; for it seemed so hard to comprehend, how a man who had been
born in a foreign country, could be dwelling with me in our house in
America.

As years passed on, this continual dwelling upon foreign associations,
bred in me a vague prophetic thought, that I was fated, one day or
other, to be a great voyager; and that just as my father used to
entertain strange gentlemen over their wine after dinner, I would
hereafter be telling my own adventures to an eager auditory. And I have
no doubt that this presentiment had something to do with bringing about
my subsequent rovings.

But that which perhaps more than any thing else, converted my vague
dreamings and longings into a definite purpose of seeking my fortune on
the sea, was an old-fashioned glass ship, about eighteen inches long,
and of French manufacture, which my father, some thirty years before,
had brought home from Hamburg as a present to a great-uncle of mine:
Senator Wellingborough, who had died a member of Congress in the days
of the old Constitution, and after whom I had the honor of being named.
Upon the decease of the Senator, the ship was returned to the donor.

It was kept in a square glass case, which was regularly dusted by one
of my sisters every morning, and stood on a little claw-footed Dutch
tea-table in one corner of the sitting-room. This ship, after being the
admiration of my father’s visitors in the capital, became the wonder
and delight of all the people of the village where we now resided, many
of whom used to call upon my mother, for no other purpose than to see
the ship. And well did it repay the long and curious examinations which
they were accustomed to give it.

In the first place, every bit of it was glass, and that was a great
wonder of itself; because the masts, yards, and ropes were made to
resemble exactly the corresponding parts of a real vessel that could go
to sea. She carried two tiers of black guns all along her two decks;
and often I used to try to peep in at the portholes, to see what else
was inside; but the holes were so small, and it looked so very dark
indoors, that I could discover little or nothing; though, when I was
very little, I made no doubt, that if I could but once pry open the
hull, and break the glass all to pieces, I would infallibly light upon
something wonderful, perhaps some gold guineas, of which I have always
been in want, ever since I could remember. And often I used to feel a
sort of insane desire to be the death of the glass ship, case, and all,
in order to come at the plunder; and one day, throwing out some hint of
the kind to my sisters, they ran to my mother in a great clamor; and
after that, the ship was placed on the mantel-piece for a time, beyond
my reach, and until I should recover my reason.

I do not know how to account for this temporary madness of mine, unless
it was, that I had been reading in a story-book about Captain Kidd’s
ship, that lay somewhere at the bottom of the Hudson near the
Highlands, full of gold as it could be; and that a company of men were
trying to dive down and get the treasure out of the hold, which no one
had ever thought of doing before, though there she had lain for almost
a hundred years.

Not to speak of the tall masts, and yards, and rigging of this famous
ship, among whose mazes of spun-glass I used to rove in imagination,
till I grew dizzy at the main-truck, I will only make mention of the
people on board of her. They, too, were all of glass, as beautiful
little glass sailors as any body ever saw, with hats and shoes on, just
like living men, and curious blue jackets with a sort of ruffle round
the bottom. Four or five of these sailors were very nimble little
chaps, and were mounting up the rigging with very long strides; but for
all that, they never gained a single inch in the year, as I can take my
oath.

Another sailor was sitting astride of the spanker-boom, with his arms
over his head, but I never could find out what that was for; a second
was in the fore-top, with a coil of glass rigging over his shoulder;
the cook, with a glass ax, was splitting wood near the fore-hatch; the
steward, in a glass apron, was hurrying toward the cabin with a plate
of glass pudding; and a glass dog, with a red mouth, was barking at
him; while the captain in a glass cap was smoking a glass cigar on the
quarterdeck. He was leaning against the bulwark, with one hand to his
head; perhaps he was unwell, for he looked very glassy out of the eyes.

The name of this curious ship was _La Reine,_ or The Queen, which was
painted on her stern where any one might read it, among a crowd of
glass dolphins and sea-horses carved there in a sort of semicircle.

And this Queen rode undisputed mistress of a green glassy sea, some of
whose waves were breaking over her bow in a wild way, I can tell you,
and I used to be giving her up for lost and foundered every moment,
till I grew older, and perceived that she was not in the slightest
danger in the world.

A good deal of dust, and fuzzy stuff like down, had in the course of
many years worked through the joints of the case, in which the ship was
kept, so as to cover all the sea with a light dash of white, which if
any thing improved the general effect, for it looked like the foam and
froth raised by the terrible gale the good Queen was battling against.

So much for _La Reine._ We have her yet in the house, but many of her
glass spars and ropes are now sadly shattered and broken,—but I will
not have her mended; and her figurehead, a gallant warrior in a
cocked-hat, lies pitching headforemost down into the trough of a
calamitous sea under the bows—but I will not have him put on his legs
again, till I get on my own; for between him and me there is a secret
sympathy; and my sisters tell me, even yet, that he fell from his perch
the very day I left home to go to sea on this _my first voyage._




CHAPTER II.
REDBURN’S DEPARTURE FROM HOME


It was with a heavy heart and full eyes, that my poor mother parted
with me; perhaps she thought me an erring and a willful boy, and
perhaps I was; but if I was, it had been a hardhearted world, and hard
times that had made me so. I had learned to think much and bitterly
before my time; all my young mounting dreams of glory had left me; and
at that early age, I was as unambitious as a man of sixty.

Yes, I will go to sea; cut my kind uncles and aunts, and sympathizing
patrons, and leave no heavy hearts but those in my own home, and take
none along but the one which aches in my bosom. Cold, bitter cold as
December, and bleak as its blasts, seemed the world then to me; there
is no misanthrope like a boy disappointed; and such was I, with the
warmth of me flogged out by adversity. But these thoughts are bitter
enough even now, for they have not yet gone quite away; and they must
be uncongenial enough to the reader; so no more of that, and let me go
on with my story.

“Yes, I will write you, dear mother, as soon as I can,” murmured I, as
she charged me for the hundredth time, not fail to inform her of my
safe arrival in New York.

“And now Mary, Martha, and Jane, kiss me all round, dear sisters, and
then I am off. I’ll be back in four months—it will be autumn then, and
we’ll go into the woods after nuts, an I’ll tell you all about Europe.
Good-by! good-by!”

So I broke loose from their arms, and not daring to look behind, ran
away as fast as I could, till I got to the corner where my brother was
waiting. He accompanied me part of the way to the place, where the
steamboat was to leave for New York; instilling into me much sage
advice above his age, for he was but eight years my senior, and warning
me again and again to take care of myself; and I solemnly promised I
would; for what cast-away will not promise to take of care himself,
when he sees that unless he himself does, no one else will.

We walked on in silence till I saw that his strength was giving out,—he
was in ill health then,—and with a mute grasp of the hand, and a loud
thump at the heart, we parted.

It was early on a raw, cold, damp morning toward the end of spring, and
the world was before me; stretching away a long muddy road, lined with
comfortable houses, whose inmates were taking their sunrise naps,
heedless of the wayfarer passing. The cold drops of drizzle trickled
down my leather cap, and mingled with a few hot tears on my cheeks.

I had the whole road to myself, for no one was yet stirring, and I
walked on, with a slouching, dogged gait. The gray shooting-jacket was
on my back, and from the end of my brother’s rifle hung a small bundle
of my clothes. My fingers worked moodily at the stock and trigger, and
I thought that this indeed was the way to begin life, with a gun in
your hand!

Talk not of the bitterness of middle-age and after life; a boy can feel
all that, and much more, when upon his young soul the mildew has
fallen; and the fruit, which with others is only blasted after
ripeness, with him is nipped in the first blossom and bud. And never
again can such blights be made good; they strike in too deep, and leave
such a scar that the air of Paradise might not erase it. And it is a
hard and cruel thing thus in early youth to taste beforehand the pangs
which should be reserved for the stout time of manhood, when the
gristle has become bone, and we stand up and fight out our lives, as a
thing tried before and foreseen; for then we are veterans used to
sieges and battles, and not green recruits, recoiling at the first
shock of the encounter.

At last gaining the boat we pushed off, and away we steamed down the
Hudson. There were few passengers on board, the day was so unpleasant;
and they were mostly congregated in the after cabin round the stoves.
After breakfast, some of them went to reading: others took a nap on the
settees; and others sat in silent circles, speculating, no doubt, as to
who each other might be.

They were certainly a cheerless set, and to me they all looked
stony-eyed and heartless. I could not help it, I almost hated them; and
to avoid them, went on deck, but a storm of sleet drove me below. At
last I bethought me, that I had not procured a ticket, and going to the
captain’s office to pay my passage and get one, was horror-struck to
find, that the price of passage had been suddenly raised that day,
owing to the other boats not running; so that I had not enough money to
pay for my fare. I had supposed it would be but a dollar, and only a
dollar did I have, whereas it was two. What was to be done? The boat
was off, and there was no backing out; so I determined to say nothing
to any body, and grimly wait until called upon for my fare.

The long weary day wore on till afternoon; one incessant storm raged on
deck; but after dinner the few passengers, waked up with their
roast-beef and mutton, became a little more sociable. Not with me, for
the scent and savor of poverty was upon me, and they all cast toward me
their evil eyes and cold suspicious glances, as I sat apart, though
among them. I felt that desperation and recklessness of poverty which
only a pauper knows. There was a mighty patch upon one leg of my
trowsers, neatly sewed on, for it had been executed by my mother, but
still very obvious and incontrovertible to the eye. This patch I had
hitherto studiously endeavored to hide with the ample skirts of my
shooting-jacket; but now I stretched out my leg boldly, and thrust the
patch under their noses, and looked at them so, that they soon looked
away, boy though I was. Perhaps the gun that I clenched frightened them
into respect; or there might have been something ugly in my eye; or my
teeth were white, and my jaws were set. For several hours, I sat gazing
at a jovial party seated round a mahogany table, with some crackers and
cheese, and wine and cigars. Their faces were flushed with the good
dinner they had eaten; and mine felt pale and wan with a long fast. If
I had presumed to offer to make one of their party; if I had told them
of my circumstances, and solicited something to refresh me, I very well
knew from the peculiar hollow ring of their laughter, they would have
had the waiters put me out of the cabin, for a beggar, who had no
business to be warming himself at their stove. And for that insult,
though only a conceit, I sat and gazed at them, putting up no petitions
for their prosperity. My whole soul was soured within me, and when at
last the captain’s clerk, a slender young man, dressed in the height of
fashion, with a gold watch chain and broach, came round collecting the
tickets, I buttoned up my coat to the throat, clutched my gun, put on
my leather cap, and pulling it well down, stood up like a sentry before
him. He held out his hand, deeming any remark superfluous, as his
object in pausing before me must be obvious. But I stood motionless and
silent, and in a moment he saw how it was with me. I ought to have
spoken and told him the case, in plain, civil terms, and offered my
dollar, and then waited the event. But I felt too wicked for that. He
did not wait a great while, but spoke first himself; and in a gruff
voice, very unlike his urbane accents when accosting the wine and cigar
party, demanded my ticket. I replied that I had none. He then demanded
the money; and upon my answering that I had not enough, in a loud angry
voice that attracted all eyes, he ordered me out of the cabin into the
storm. The devil in me then mounted up from my soul, and spread over my
frame, till it tingled at my finger ends; and I muttered out my
resolution to stay where I was, in such a manner, that the ticket man
faltered back. “There’s a dollar for you,” I added, offering it.

“I want two,” said he.

“Take that or nothing,” I answered; “it is all I have.”

I thought he would strike me. But, accepting the money, he contented
himself with saying something about sportsmen going on shooting
expeditions, without having money to pay their expenses; and hinted
that such chaps might better lay aside their fowling-pieces, and assume
the buck and saw. He then passed on, and left every eye fastened upon
me.

I stood their gazing some time, but at last could stand it no more. I
pushed my seat right up before the most insolent gazer, a short fat
man, with a plethora of cravat round his neck, and fixing my gaze on
his, gave him more gazes than he sent. This somewhat embarrassed him,
and he looked round for some one to take hold of me; but no one coming,
he pretended to be very busy counting the gilded wooden beams overhead.
I then turned to the next gazer, and clicking my gun-lock, deliberately
presented the piece at him.

Upon this, he overset his seat in his eagerness to get beyond my range,
for I had him point blank, full in the left eye; and several persons
starting to their feet, exclaimed that I must be crazy. So I was at
that time; for otherwise I know not how to account for my demoniac
feelings, of which I was afterward heartily ashamed, as I ought to have
been, indeed; and much more than that.

I then turned on my heel, and shouldering my fowling-piece and bundle,
marched on deck, and walked there through the dreary storm, till I was
wet through, and the boat touched the wharf at New York.

Such is boyhood.




CHAPTER III.
HE ARRIVES IN TOWN


From the boat’s bow, I jumped ashore, before she was secured, and
following my brother’s directions, proceeded across the town toward St.
John’s Park, to the house of a college friend of his, for whom I had a
letter.

It was a long walk; and I stepped in at a sort of grocery to get a
drink of water, where some six or eight rough looking fellows were
playing dominoes upon the counter, seated upon cheese boxes. They
winked, and asked what sort of sport I had had gunning on such a rainy
day, but I only gulped down my water and stalked off.

Dripping like a seal, I at last grounded arms at the doorway of my
brother’s friend, rang the bell and inquired for him.

“What do you want?” said the servant, eying me as if I were a
housebreaker.

“I want to see your lord and master; show me into the parlor.”

Upon this my host himself happened to make his appearance, and seeing
who I was, opened his hand and heart to me at once, and drew me to his
fireside; he had received a letter from my brother, and had expected me
that day.

The family were at tea; the fragrant herb filled the room with its
aroma; the brown toast was odoriferous; and everything pleasant and
charming. After a temporary warming, I was shown to a room, where I
changed my wet dress, and returning to the table, found that the
interval had been well improved by my hostess; a meal for a traveler
was spread and I laid into it sturdily. Every mouthful pushed the devil
that had been tormenting me all day farther and farther out of me, till
at last I entirely ejected him with three successive bowls of Bohea.

Magic of kind words, and kind deeds, and good tea! That night I went to
bed thinking the world pretty tolerable, after all; and I could hardly
believe that I had really acted that morning as I had, for I was
naturally of an easy and forbearing disposition; though when such a
disposition is temporarily roused, it is perhaps worse than a
cannibal’s.

Next day, my brother’s friend, whom I choose to call Mr. Jones,
accompanied me down to the docks among the shipping, in order to get me
a place. After a good deal of searching we lighted upon a ship for
Liverpool, and found the captain in the cabin; which was a very
handsome one, lined with mahogany and maple; and the steward, an
elegant looking mulatto in a gorgeous turban, was setting out on a sort
of sideboard some dinner service which looked like silver, but it was
only Britannia ware highly polished.

As soon as I clapped my eye on the captain, I thought myself he was
just the captain to suit me. He was a fine looking man, about forty,
splendidly dressed, with very black whiskers, and very white teeth, and
what I took to be a free, frank look out of a large hazel eye. I liked
him amazingly. He was promenading up and down the cabin, humming some
brisk air to himself when we entered.

“Good morning, sir,” said my friend.

“Good morning, good morning, sir,” said the captain. “Steward, chairs
for the gentlemen.”

“Oh! never mind, sir,” said Mr. Jones, rather taken aback by his
extreme civility. “I merely called to see whether you want a fine young
lad to go to sea with you. Here he is; he has long wanted to be a
sailor; and his friends have at last concluded to let him go for one
voyage, and see how he likes it.”

“Ah! indeed!” said the captain, blandly, and looking where I stood.
“He’s a fine fellow; I like him. So you want to be a sailor, my boy, do
you?” added he, affectionately patting my head. “It’s a hard life,
though; a hard life.”

But when I looked round at his comfortable, and almost luxurious cabin,
and then at his handsome care-free face, I thought he was only trying
to frighten me, and I answered, “Well, sir, I am ready to try it.”

“I hope he’s a country lad, sir,” said the captain to my friend, “these
city boys are sometimes hard cases.”

“Oh! yes, he’s from the country,” was the reply, “and of a highly
respectable family; his great-uncle died a Senator.”

“But his great-uncle don’t want to go to sea too?” said the captain,
looking funny.

“Oh! no, oh, no!— Ha! ha!”

“Ha! ha!” echoed the captain.

A fine funny gentleman, thought I, not much fancying, however, his
levity concerning my great-uncle, he’ll be cracking his jokes the whole
voyage; and so I afterward said to one of the riggers on board; but he
bade me look out, that he did not crack my head.

“Well, my lad,” said the captain, “I suppose you know we haven’t any
pastures and cows on board; you can’t get any milk at sea, you know.”

“Oh! I know all about that, sir; my father has crossed the ocean, if I
haven’t.”

“Yes,” cried my friend, “his father, a gentleman of one of the first
families in America, crossed the Atlantic several times on important
business.”

“Embassador extraordinary?” said the captain, looking funny again.

“Oh! no, he was a wealthy merchant.”

“Ah! indeed;” said the captain, looking grave and bland again, “then
this fine lad is the son of a gentleman?”

“Certainly,” said my friend, “and he’s only going to sea for the humor
of it; they want to send him on his travels with a tutor, but he _will_
go to sea as a sailor.”

The fact was, that my young friend (for he was only about twenty-five)
was not a very wise man; and this was a huge fib, which out of the
kindness of his heart, he told in my behalf, for the purpose of
creating a profound respect for me in the eyes of my future lord.

Upon being apprized, that I had willfully forborne taking the grand
tour with a tutor, in order to put my hand in a tar-bucket, the
handsome captain looked ten times more funny than ever; and said that
_he_ himself would be my tutor, and take me on my travels, and pay for
the privilege.

“Ah!” said my friend, “that reminds me of business. Pray, captain, how
much do you generally pay a handsome young fellow like this?”

“Well,” said the captain, looking grave and profound, “we are not so
particular about beauty, and we never give more than three dollars to a
green lad like Wellingborough here, that’s your name, my boy?
Wellingborough Redburn!—Upon my soul, a fine sounding name.”

“Why, captain,” said Mr. Jones, quickly interrupting him, “that won’t
pay for his clothing.”

“But you know his highly respectable and wealthy relations will
doubtless see to all that,” replied the captain, with his funny look
again.

“Oh! yes, I forgot that,” said Mr. Jones, looking rather foolish. “His
friends will of course see to that.”

“Of course,” said the captain smiling.

“Of course,” repeated Mr. Jones, looking ruefully at the patch on my
pantaloons, which just then I endeavored to hide with the skirt of my
shooting-jacket.

“You are quite a sportsman I see,” said the captain, eying the great
buttons on my coat, upon each of which was a carved fox.

Upon this my benevolent friend thought that here was a grand
opportunity to befriend me.

“Yes, he’s quite a sportsman,” said he, “he’s got a very valuable
fowling-piece at home, perhaps you would like to purchase it, captain,
to shoot gulls with at sea? It’s cheap.”

“Oh! no, he had better leave it with his relations,” said the captain,
“so that he can go hunting again when he returns from England.”

“Yes, perhaps that _would_ be better, after all,” said my friend,
pretending to fall into a profound musing, involving all sides of the
matter in hand. “Well, then, captain, you can only give the boy three
dollars a month, you say?”

“Only three dollars a month,” said the captain.

“And I believe,” said my friend, “that you generally give something in
advance, do you not?”

“Yes, that is sometimes the custom at the shipping offices,” said the
captain, with a bow, “but in this case, as the boy has rich relations,
there will be no need of that, you know.”

And thus, by his ill-advised, but well-meaning hints concerning the
respectability of my paternity, and the immense wealth of my relations,
did this really honest-hearted but foolish friend of mine, prevent me
from getting three dollars in advance, which I greatly needed. However,
I said nothing, though I thought the more; and particularly, how that
it would have been much better for me, to have gone on board alone,
accosted the captain on my own account, and told him the plain truth.
Poor people make a very poor business of it when they try to seem rich.

The arrangement being concluded, we bade the captain good morning; and
as we were about leaving the cabin, he smiled again, and said, “Well,
Redburn, my boy, you won’t get home-sick before you sail, because that
will make you very sea-sick when you get to sea.”

And with that he smiled very pleasantly, and bowed two or three times,
and told the steward to open the cabin-door, which the steward did with
a peculiar sort of grin on his face, and a slanting glance at my
shooting-jacket. And so we left.




CHAPTER IV.
HOW HE DISPOSED OF HIS FOWLING-PIECE


Next day I went alone to the shipping office to sign the articles, and
there I met a great crowd of sailors, who as soon as they found what I
was after, began to tip the wink all round, and I overheard a fellow in
a great flapping sou’wester cap say to another old tar in a shaggy
monkey-jacket, “Twig his coat, d’ye see the buttons, that chap ain’t
going to sea in a merchantman, he’s going to shoot whales. I say,
maty—look here—how d’ye sell them big buttons by the pound?”

“Give us one for a saucer, will ye?” said another.

“Let the youngster alone,” said a third. “Come here, my little boy, has
your ma put up some sweetmeats for ye to take to sea?”

They are all witty dogs, thought I to myself, trying to make the best
of the matter, for I saw it would not do to resent what they said; they
can’t mean any harm, though they are certainly very impudent; so I
tried to laugh off their banter, but as soon as ever I could, I put
down my name and beat a retreat.

On the morrow, the ship was advertised to sail. So the rest of that day
I spent in preparations. After in vain trying to sell my fowling-piece
for a fair price to chance customers, I was walking up Chatham-street
with it, when a curly-headed little man with a dark oily face, and a
hooked nose, like the pictures of Judas Iscariot, called to me from a
strange-looking shop, with three gilded balls hanging over it.

With a peculiar accent, as if he had been over-eating himself with
Indian-pudding or some other plushy compound, this curly-headed little
man very civilly invited me into his shop; and making a polite bow, and
bidding me many unnecessary good mornings, and remarking upon the fine
weather, begged me to let him look at my fowling-piece. I handed it to
him in an instant, glad of the chance of disposing of it, and told him
that was just what I wanted.

“Ah!” said he, with his Indian-pudding accent again, which I will not
try to mimic, and abating his look of eagerness, “I thought it was a
better article, it’s very old.”

“Not,” said I, starting in surprise, “it’s not been used more than
three times; what will you give for it?”

“We don’t _buy_ any thing here,” said he, suddenly looking very
indifferent, “this is a place where people _pawn_ things.” _Pawn_ being
a word I had never heard before, I asked him what it meant; when he
replied, that when people wanted any money, they came to him with their
fowling-pieces, and got one third its value, and then left the
fowling-piece there, until they were able to pay back the money.

What a benevolent little old man, this must be, thought I, and how very
obliging.

“And pray,” said I, “how much will you let me have for my gun, by way
of a pawn?”

“Well, I suppose it’s worth six dollars, and seeing you’re a boy, I’ll
let you have three dollars upon it”

“No,” exclaimed I, seizing the fowling-piece, “it’s worth five times
that, I’ll go somewhere else.”

“Good morning, then,” said he, “I hope you’ll do better,” and he bowed
me out as if he expected to see me again pretty soon.

I had not gone very far when I came across three more balls hanging
over a shop. In I went, and saw a long counter, with a sort of
picket-fence, running all along from end to end, and three little
holes, with three little old men standing inside of them, like
prisoners looking out of a jail. Back of the counter were all sorts of
things, piled up and labeled. Hats, and caps, and coats, and guns, and
swords, and canes, and chests, and planes, and books, and
writing-desks, and every thing else. And in a glass case were lots of
watches, and seals, chains, and rings, and breastpins, and all kinds of
trinkets. At one of the little holes, earnestly talking with one of the
hook-nosed men, was a thin woman in a faded silk gown and shawl,
holding a pale little girl by the hand. As I drew near, she spoke lower
in a whisper; and the man shook his head, and looked cross and rude;
and then some more words were exchanged over a miniature, and some
money was passed through the hole, and the woman and child shrank out
of the door.

I won’t sell my gun to that man, thought I; and I passed on to the next
hole; and while waiting there to be served, an elderly man in a
high-waisted surtout, thrust a silver snuff-box through; and a young
man in a calico shirt and a shiny coat with a velvet collar presented a
silver watch; and a sheepish boy in a cloak took out a frying-pan; and
another little boy had a Bible; and all these things were thrust
through to the hook-nosed man, who seemed ready to hook any thing that
came along; so I had no doubt he would gladly hook my gun, for the long
picketed counter seemed like a great seine, that caught every variety
of fish.

At last I saw a chance, and crowded in for the hole; and in order to be
beforehand with a big man who just then came in, I pushed my gun
violently through the hole; upon which the hook-nosed man cried out,
thinking I was going to shoot him. But at last he took the gun, turned
it end for end, clicked the trigger three times, and then said, “one
dollar.”

“What about one dollar?” said I.

“That’s all I’ll give,” he replied.

“Well, what do you want?” and he turned to the next person. This was a
young man in a seedy red cravat and a pimply face, that looked as if it
was going to seed likewise, who, with a mysterious tapping of his
vest-pocket and other hints, made a great show of having something
confidential to communicate.

But the hook-nosed man spoke out very loud, and said, “None of that;
take it out. Got a stolen watch? We don’t deal in them things here.”

Upon this the young man flushed all over, and looked round to see who
had heard the pawnbroker; then he took something very small out of his
pocket, and keeping it hidden under his palm, pushed it into the hole.

“Where did you get this ring?” said the pawnbroker.

“I want to pawn it,” whispered the other, blushing all over again.

“What’s your name?” said the pawnbroker, speaking very loud.

“How much will you give?” whispered the other in reply, leaning over,
and looking as if he wanted to hush up the pawnbroker.

At last the sum was agreed upon, when the man behind the counter took a
little ticket, and tying the ring to it began to write on the ticket;
all at once he asked the young man where he lived, a question which
embarrassed him very much; but at last he stammered out a certain
number in Broadway.

“That’s the City Hotel: you don’t live there,” said the man, cruelly
glancing at the shabby coat before him.

“Oh! well,” stammered the other blushing scarlet, “I thought this was
only a sort of form to go through; I don’t like to tell where I do
live, for I ain’t in the habit of going to pawnbrokers.”

“You stole that ring, you know you did,” roared out the hook-nosed man,
incensed at this slur upon his calling, and now seemingly bent on
damaging the young man’s character for life. “I’m a good mind to call a
constable; we don’t take stolen goods here, I tell you.”

All eyes were now fixed suspiciously upon this martyrized young man;
who looked ready to drop into the earth; and a poor woman in a
night-cap, with some baby-clothes in her hand, looked fearfully at the
pawnbroker, as if dreading to encounter such a terrible pattern of
integrity. At last the young man sunk off with his money, and looking
out of the window, I saw him go round the corner so sharply that he
knocked his elbow against the wall.

I waited a little longer, and saw several more served; and having
remarked that the hook-nosed men invariably fixed their own price upon
every thing, and if that was refused told the person to be off with
himself; I concluded that it would be of no use to try and get more
from them than they had offered; especially when I saw that they had a
great many fowling-pieces hanging up, and did not have particular
occasion for mine; and more than that, they must be very well off and
rich, to treat people so cavalierly.

My best plan then seemed to be to go right back to the curly-headed
pawnbroker, and take up with my first offer. But when I went back, the
curly-headed man was very busy about something else, and kept me
waiting a long time; at last I got a chance and told him I would take
the three dollars he had offered.

“Ought to have taken it when you could get it,” he replied. “I won’t
give but two dollars and a half for it now.”

In vain I expostulated; he was not to be moved, so I pocketed the money
and departed.




CHAPTER V.
HE PURCHASES HIS SEA-WARDROBE, AND ON A DISMAL RAINY DAY PICKS UP HIS
BOARD AND LODGING ALONG THE WHARVES


The first thing I now did was to buy a little stationery, and keep my
promise to my mother, by writing her; and I also wrote to my brother
informing him of the voyage I purposed making, and indulging in some
romantic and misanthropic views of life, such as many boys in my
circumstances, are accustomed to do.

The rest of the two dollars and a half I laid out that very morning in
buying a red woolen shirt near Catharine Market, a tarpaulin hat, which
I got at an out-door stand near Peck Slip, a belt and jackknife, and
two or three trifles. After these purchases, I had only one penny left,
so I walked out to the end of the pier, and threw the penny into the
water. The reason why I did this, was because I somehow felt almost
desperate again, and didn’t care what became of me. But if the penny
had been a dollar, I would have kept it.

I went home to dinner at Mr. Jones’, and they welcomed me very kindly,
and Mrs. Jones kept my plate full all the time during dinner, so that I
had no chance to empty it. She seemed to see that I felt bad, and
thought plenty of pudding might help me. At any rate, I never felt so
bad yet but I could eat a good dinner. And once, years afterward, when
I expected to be killed every day, I remember my appetite was very
keen, and I said to myself, “Eat away, Wellingborough, while you can,
for this may be the last supper you will have.”

After dinner I went into my room, locked the door carefully, and hung a
towel over the knob, so that no one could peep through the keyhole, and
then went to trying on my red woolen shirt before the glass, to see
what sort of a looking sailor I was going to make. As soon as I got
into the shirt I began to feel sort of warm and red about the face,
which I found was owing to the reflection of the dyed wool upon my
skin. After that, I took a pair of scissors and went to cutting my
hair, which was very long. I thought every little would help, in making
me a light hand to run aloft.

Next morning I bade my kind host and hostess good-by, and left the
house with my bundle, feeling somewhat misanthropical and desperate
again.

Before I reached the ship, it began to rain hard; and as soon as I
arrived at the wharf, it was plain that there would be no getting to
sea that day.

This was a great disappointment to me, for I did not want to return to
Mr. Jones’ again after bidding them good-by; it would be so awkward. So
I concluded to go on board ship for the present.

When I reached the deck, I saw no one but a large man in a large
dripping pea-jacket, who was calking down the main-hatches.

“What do you want, Pillgarlic?” said he.

“I’ve shipped to sail in this ship,” I replied, assuming a little
dignity, to chastise his familiarity.

“What for? a tailor?” said he, looking at my shooting jacket.

I answered that I was going as a “boy;” for so I was technically put
down on the articles.

“Well,” said he, “have you got your traps aboard?”

I told him I didn’t know there were any rats in the ship, and hadn’t
brought any “trap.”

At this he laughed out with a great guffaw, and said there must be
hay-seed in my hair.

This made me mad; but thinking he must be one of the sailors who was
going in the ship, I thought it wouldn’t be wise to make an enemy of
him, so only asked him where the men slept in the vessel, for I wanted
to put my clothes away.

_“Where’s_ your clothes?” said he.

“Here in my bundle,” said I, holding it up.

“Well if that’s all you’ve got,” he cried, “you’d better chuck it
overboard. But go forward, go forward to the forecastle; that’s the
place you’ll live in aboard here.”

And with that he directed me to a sort of hole in the deck in the bow
of the ship; but looking down, and seeing how dark it was, I asked him
for a light.

“Strike your eyes together and make one,” said he, “we don’t have any
lights here.” So I groped my way down into the forecastle, which smelt
so bad of old ropes and tar, that it almost made me sick. After waiting
patiently, I began to see a little; and looking round, at last
perceived I was in a smoky looking place, with twelve wooden boxes
stuck round the sides. In some of these boxes were large chests, which
I at once supposed to belong to the sailors, who must have taken that
method of appropriating their “Trunks,” as I afterward found these
boxes were called. And so it turned out.

After examining them for a while, I selected an empty one, and put my
bundle right in the middle of it, so that there might be no mistake
about my claim to the place, particularly as the bundle was so small.

This done, I was glad to get on deck; and learning to a certainty that
the ship would not sail till the next day, I resolved to go ashore, and
walk about till dark, and then return and sleep out the night in the
forecastle. So I walked about all over, till I was weary, and went into
a mean liquor shop to rest; for having my tarpaulin on, and not looking
very gentlemanly, I was afraid to go into any better place, for fear of
being driven out. Here I sat till I began to feel very hungry; and
seeing some doughnuts on the counter, I began to think what a fool I
had been, to throw away my last penny; for the doughnuts were but a
penny apiece, and they looked very plump, and fat, and round. I never
saw doughnuts look so enticing before; especially when a negro came in,
and ate one before my eyes. At last I thought I would fill up a little
by drinking a glass of water; having read somewhere that this was a
good plan to follow in a case like the present. I did not feel thirsty,
but only hungry; so had much ado to get down the water; for it tasted
warm; and the tumbler had an ugly flavor; the negro had been drinking
some spirits out of it just before.

I marched off again, every once in a while stopping to take in some
more water, and being very careful not to step into the same shop
twice, till night came on, and I found myself soaked through, for it
had been raining more or less all day. As I went to the ship, I could
not help thinking how lonesome it would be, to spend the whole night in
that damp and dark forecastle, without light or fire, and nothing to
lie on but the bare boards of my bunk. However, to drown all such
thoughts, I gulped down another glass of water, though I was wet enough
outside and in by this time; and trying to put on a bold look, as if I
had just been eating a hearty meal, I stepped aboard the ship.

The man in the big pea-jacket was not to be seen; but on going forward
I unexpectedly found a young lad there, about my own age; and as soon
as he opened his mouth I knew he was not an American. He talked such a
curious language though, half English and half gibberish, that I knew
not what to make of him; and was a little astonished, when he told me
he was an English boy, from Lancashire.

It seemed, he had come over from Liverpool in this very ship on her
last voyage, as a steerage passenger; but finding that he would have to
work very hard to get along in America, and getting home-sick into the
bargain, he had arranged with the captain to work his passage back.

I was glad to have some company, and tried to get him conversing; but
found he was the most stupid and ignorant boy I had ever met with. I
asked him something about the river Thames; when he said that he hadn’t
traveled any in America and didn’t know any thing about the rivers
here. And when I told him the river Thames was in England, he showed no
surprise or shame at his ignorance, but only looked ten times more
stupid than before.

At last we went below into the forecastle, and both getting into the
same bunk, stretched ourselves out on the planks, and I tried my best
to get asleep. But though my companion soon began to snore very loud,
for me, I could not forget myself, owing to the horrid smell of the
place, my being so wet, cold, and hungry, and besides all that, I felt
damp and clammy about the heart. I lay turning over and over, listening
to the Lancashire boy’s snoring, till at last I felt so, that I had to
go on deck; and there I walked till morning, which I thought would
never come.

As soon as I thought the groceries on the wharf would be open I left
the ship and went to make my breakfast of another glass of water. But
this made me very qualmish; and soon I felt sick as death; my head was
dizzy; and I went staggering along the walk, almost blind. At last I
dropt on a heap of chain-cable, and shutting my eyes hard, did my best
to rally myself, in which I succeeded, at last, enough to get up and
walk off. Then I thought that I had done wrong in not returning to my
friend’s house the day before; and would have walked there now, as it
was, only it was at least three miles up town; too far for me to walk
in such a state, and I had no sixpence to ride in an omnibus.




CHAPTER VI.
HE IS INITIATED IN THE BUSINESS OF CLEANING OUT THE PIG-PEN, AND
SLUSHING DOWN THE TOP-MAST


By the time I got back to the ship, every thing was in an uproar. The
pea-jacket man was there, ordering about a good many men in the
rigging, and people were bringing off chickens, and pigs, and beef, and
vegetables from the shore. Soon after, another man, in a striped calico
shirt, a short blue jacket and beaver hat, made his appearance, and
went to ordering about the man in the big pea-jacket; and at last the
captain came up the side, and began to order about both of them.

These two men turned out to be the first and second mates of the ship.

Thinking to make friends with the second mate, I took out an old
tortoise-shell snuff-box of my father’s, in which I had put a piece of
Cavendish tobacco, to look sailor-like, and offered the box to him very
politely. He stared at me a moment, and then exclaimed, “Do you think
we take snuff aboard here, youngster? no, no, no time for snuff-taking
at sea; don’t let the ‘old man’ see that snuff-box; take my advice and
pitch it overboard as quick as you can.”

I told him it was not snuff, but tobacco; when he said, he had plenty
of tobacco of his own, and never carried any such nonsense about him as
a tobacco-box. With that, he went off about his business, and left me
feeling foolish enough. But I had reason to be glad he had acted thus,
for if he had not, I think I should have offered my box to the chief
mate, who in that case, from what I afterward learned of him, would
have knocked me down, or done something else equally uncivil.

As I was standing looking round me, the chief mate approached in a
great hurry about something, and seeing me in his way, cried out,
“Ashore with you, you young loafer! There’s no stealings here; sail
away, I tell you, with that shooting-jacket!”

Upon this I retreated, saying that I was going out in the ship as a
sailor.

“A sailor!” he cried, “a barber’s clerk, you mean; _you_ going out in
the ship? what, in that jacket? Hang me, I hope the old man hasn’t been
shipping any more greenhorns like you—he’ll make a shipwreck of it if
he has. But this is the way nowadays; to save a few dollars in seamen’s
wages, they think nothing of shipping a parcel of farmers and
clodhoppers and baby-boys. What’s your name, Pillgarlic?”

“Redburn,” said I.

“A pretty handle to a man, that; scorch you to take hold of it; haven’t
you got any other?”

“Wellingborough,” said I.

“Worse yet. Who had the baptizing of ye? Why didn’t they call you Jack,
or Jill, or something short and handy. But I’ll baptize you over again.
D’ye hear, sir, henceforth your name is _Buttons._ And now do you go,
Buttons, and clean out that pig-pen in the long-boat; it has not been
cleaned out since last voyage. And bear a hand about it, d’ye hear;
there’s them pigs there waiting to be put in; come, be off about it,
now.”

Was this then the beginning of my sea-career? set to cleaning out a
pig-pen, the very first thing?

But I thought it best to say nothing; I had bound myself to obey
orders, and it was too late to retreat. So I only asked for a shovel,
or spade, or something else to work with.

“We don’t dig gardens here,” was the reply; “dig it out with your
teeth!”

After looking round, I found a stick and went to scraping out the pen,
which was awkward work enough, for another boat called the
“jolly-boat,” was capsized right over the longboat, which brought them
almost close together. These two boats were in the middle of the deck.
I managed to crawl inside of the long-boat; and after barking my shins
against the seats, and bumping my head a good many times, I got along
to the stern, where the pig-pen was.

While I was hard at work a drunken sailor peeped in, and cried out to
his comrades, “Look here, my lads, what sort of a pig do you call this?
Hallo! inside there! what are you ’bout there? trying to stow yourself
away to steal a passage to Liverpool? Out of that! out of that, I say.”
But just then the mate came along and ordered this drunken rascal
ashore.

The pig-pen being cleaned out, I was set to work picking up some
shavings, which lay about the deck; for there had been carpenters at
work on board. The mate ordered me to throw these shavings into the
long-boat at a particular place between two of the seats. But as I
found it hard work to push the shavings through in that place, and as
it looked wet there, I thought it would be better for the shavings as
well as myself, to thrust them where there was a larger opening and a
dry spot. While I was thus employed, the mate observing me, exclaimed
with an oath, “Didn’t I tell you to put those shavings somewhere else?
Do what I tell you, now, Buttons, or mind your eye!”

Stifling my indignation at his rudeness, which by this time I found was
my only plan, I replied that that was not so good a place for the
shavings as that which I myself had selected, and asked him to tell me
_why_ he wanted me to put them in the place he designated. Upon this,
he flew into a terrible rage, and without explanation reiterated his
order like a clap of thunder.

This was my first lesson in the discipline of the sea, and I never
forgot it. From that time I learned that sea-officers never gave
reasons for any thing they order to be done. It is enough that they
command it, so that the motto is, _“Obey orders, though you break
owners.”_

I now began to feel very faint and sick _again,_ and longed for the
ship to be leaving the dock; for then I made no doubt we would soon be
having something to eat. But as yet, I saw none of the sailors on
board, and as for the men at work in the rigging, I found out that they
were _“riggers,”_ that is, men living ashore, who worked by the day in
getting ships ready for sea; and this I found out to my cost, for
yielding to the kind blandishment of one of these _riggers, I_ had
swapped away my jackknife with him for a much poorer one of his own,
thinking to secure a sailor friend for the voyage. At last I watched my
chance, and while people’s backs were turned, I seized a carrot from
several bunches lying on deck, and clapping it under the skirts of my
shooting-jacket, went forward to eat it; for I had often eaten raw
carrots, which taste something like chestnuts. This carrot refreshed me
a good deal, though at the expense of a little pain in my stomach.
Hardly had I disposed of it, when I heard the chief mate’s voice crying
out for “Buttons.” I ran after him, and received an order to go aloft
and “slush down the main-top mast.”

This was all Greek to me, and after receiving the order, I stood
staring about me, wondering what it was that was to be done. But the
mate had turned on his heel, and made no explanations. At length I
followed after him, and asked what I must do.

“Didn’t I tell you to slush down the main-top mast?” he shouted.

“You did,” said I, “but I don’t know what that means.”

“Green as grass! a regular cabbage-head!” he exclaimed to himself. “A
fine time I’ll have with such a greenhorn aboard. Look you, youngster.
Look up to that long pole there—d’ye see it? that piece of a tree
there, you timber-head—well—take this bucket here, and go up the
rigging—that rope-ladder there—do you understand?—and dab this slush
all over the mast, and look out for your head if one drop falls on
deck. Be off now, Buttons.”

The eventful hour had arrived; for the first time in my life I was to
ascend a ship’s mast. Had I been well and hearty, perhaps I should have
felt a little shaky at the thought; but as I was then, weak and faint,
the bare thought appalled me.

But there was no hanging back; it would look like cowardice, and I
could not bring myself to confess that I was suffering for want of
food; so rallying again, I took up the bucket.

It was a heavy bucket, with strong iron hoops, and might have held
perhaps two gallons. But it was only half full now of a sort of thick
lobbered gravy, which I afterward learned was boiled out of the salt
beef used by the sailors. Upon getting into the rigging, I found it was
no easy job to carry this heavy bucket up with me. The rope handle of
it was so slippery with grease, that although I twisted it several
times about my wrist, it would be still twirling round and round, and
slipping off. Spite of this, however, I managed to mount as far as the
“top,” the clumsy bucket half the time straddling and swinging about
between my legs, and in momentary danger of capsizing. Arrived at the
“top,” I came to a dead halt, and looked up. How to surmount that
overhanging impediment completely posed me for the time. But at last,
with much straining, I contrived to place my bucket in the “top;” and
then, trusting to Providence, swung myself up after it. The rest of the
road was comparatively easy; though whenever I incautiously looked down
toward the deck, my head spun round so from weakness, that I was
obliged to shut my eyes to recover myself. I do not remember much more.
I only recollect my safe return to the deck.

In a short time the bustle of the ship increased; the trunks of cabin
passengers arrived, and the chests and boxes of the steerage
passengers, besides baskets of wine and fruit for the captain.

At last we cast loose, and swinging out into the stream, came to
anchor, and hoisted the signal for sailing. Every thing, it seemed, was
on board but the crew; who in a few hours after, came off, one by one,
in Whitehall boats, their chests in the bow, and themselves lying back
in the stem like lords; and showing very plainly the complacency they
felt in keeping the whole ship waiting for their lordships.

“Ay, ay,” muttered the chief mate, as they rolled out of then-boats and
swaggered on deck, “it’s your turn now, but it will be mine before
long. Yaw about while you may, my hearties, I’ll do the yawing after
the anchor’s up.”

Several of the sailors were very drunk, and one of them was lifted on
board insensible by his landlord, who carried him down below and dumped
him into a bunk. And two other sailors, as soon as they made their
appearance, immediately went below to sleep off the fumes of their
drink.

At last, all the crew being on board, word was passed to go to dinner
fore and aft, an order that made my heart jump with delight, for now my
long fast would be broken. But though the sailors, surfeited with
eating and drinking ashore, did not then touch the salt beef and
potatoes which the black cook handed down into the forecastle; and
though this left the whole allowance to me; to my surprise, I found
that I could eat little or nothing; for now I only felt deadly faint,
but not hungry.




CHAPTER VII.
HE GETS TO SEA AND FEELS VERY BAD


Every thing at last being in readiness, the pilot came on board, and
all hands were called to up anchor. While I worked at my bar, I could
not help observing how haggard the men looked, and how much they
suffered from this violent exercise, after the terrific dissipation in
which they had been indulging ashore. But I soon learnt that sailors
breathe nothing about such things, but strive their best to appear all
alive and hearty, though it comes very hard for many of them.

The anchor being secured, a steam tug-boat with a strong name, the
Hercules, took hold of us; and away we went past the long line of
shipping, and wharves, and warehouses; and rounded the green south
point of the island where the Battery is, and passed Governor’s Island,
and pointed right out for the Narrows.

My heart was like lead, and I felt bad enough, Heaven knows; but then,
there was plenty of work to be done, which kept my thoughts from
becoming too much for me.

And I tried to think all the time, that I was going to England, and
that, before many months, I should have actually been there and home
again, telling my adventures to my brothers and sisters; and with what
delight they would listen, and how they would look up to me then, and
reverence my sayings; and how that even my elder brother would be
forced to treat me with great consideration, as having crossed the
Atlantic Ocean, which he had never done, and there was no probability
he ever would.

With such thoughts as these I endeavored to shake off my
heavy-heartedness; but it would not do at all; for this was only the
first day of the voyage, and many weeks, nay, several whole months must
elapse before the voyage was ended; and who could tell what might
happen to me; for when I looked up at the high, giddy masts, and
thought how often I must be going up and down them, I thought sure
enough that some luckless day or other, I would certainly fall
overboard and be drowned. And then, I thought of lying down at the
bottom of the sea, stark alone, with the great waves rolling over me,
and no one in the wide world knowing that I was there. And I thought
how much better and sweeter it must be, to be buried under the pleasant
hedge that bounded the sunny south side of our village grave-yard,
where every Sunday I had used to walk after church in the afternoon;
and I almost wished I was there now; yes, dead and buried in that
churchyard. All the time my eyes were filled with tears, and I kept
holding my breath, to choke down the sobs, for indeed I could not help
feeling as I did, and no doubt any boy in the world would have felt
just as I did then.

As the steamer carried us further and further down the bay, and we
passed ships lying at anchor, with men gazing at us and waving their
hats; and small boats with ladies in them waving their handkerchiefs;
and passed the green shore of Staten Island, and caught sight of so
many beautiful cottages all overrun with vines, and planted on the
beautiful fresh mossy hill-sides; oh! then I would have given any thing
if instead of sailing _out of_ the bay, we were only coming _into_ it;
if we had crossed the ocean and returned, gone over and come back; and
my heart leaped up in me like something alive when I thought of really
entering that bay at the end of the voyage. But that was so far
distant, that it seemed it could never be. No, never, never more would
I see New York again.

And what shocked me more than any thing else, was to hear some of the
sailors, while they were at work coiling away the hawsers, talking
about the boarding-houses they were going to, when they came back; and
how that some friends of theirs had promised to be on the wharf when
the ship returned, to take them and their chests right up to
Franklin-square where they lived; and how that they would have a good
dinner ready, and plenty of cigars and spirits out on the balcony. I
say this kind of talking shocked me, for they did not seem to consider,
as I did, that before any thing like that could happen, we must cross
the great Atlantic Ocean, cross over from America to Europe and back
again, many thousand miles of foaming ocean.

At that time I did not know what to make of these sailors; but this
much I thought, that when they were boys, they could never have gone to
the Sunday School; for they swore so, it made my ears tingle, and used
words that I never could hear without a dreadful loathing.

And are these the men, I thought to myself, that I must live with so
long? these the men I am to eat with, and sleep with all the time? And
besides, I now began to see, that they were not going to be very kind
to me; but I will tell all about that when the proper time comes.

Now you must not think, that because all these things were passing
through my mind, that I had nothing to do but sit still and think; no,
no, I was hard at work: for as long as the steamer had hold of us, we
were very busy coiling away ropes and cables, and putting the decks in
order; which were littered all over with odds and ends of things that
had to be put away.

At last we got as far as the Narrows, which every body knows is the
entrance to New York Harbor from sea; and it may well be called the
Narrows, for when you go in or out, it seems like going in or out of a
doorway; and when you go out of these Narrows on a long voyage like
this of mine, it seems like going out into the broad highway, where not
a soul is to be seen. For far away and away, stretches the great
Atlantic Ocean; and all you can see beyond it where the sky comes down
to the water. It looks lonely and desolate enough, and I could hardly
believe, as I gazed around me, that there could be any land beyond, or
any place like Europe or England or Liverpool in the great wide world.
It seemed too strange, and wonderful, and altogether incredible, that
there could really be cities and towns and villages and green fields
and hedges and farm-yards and orchards, away over that wide blank of
sea, and away beyond the place where the sky came down to the water.
And to think of steering right out among those waves, and leaving the
bright land behind, and the dark night coming on, too, seemed wild and
foolhardy; and I looked with a sort of fear at the sailors standing by
me, who could be so thoughtless at such a time. But then I remembered,
how many times my own father had said he had crossed the ocean; and I
had never dreamed of such a thing as doubting him; for I always thought
him a marvelous being, infinitely purer and greater than I was, who
could not by any possibility do wrong, or say an untruth. Yet now, how
could I credit it, that he, my own father, whom I so well remembered;
had ever sailed out of these Narrows, and sailed right through the sky
and water line, and gone to England, and France, Liverpool, and
Marseilles. It was too wonderful to believe.

Now, on the right hand side of the Narrows as you go out, the land is
quite high; and on the top of a fine cliff is a great castle or fort,
all in ruins, and with the trees growing round it. It was built by
Governor Tompkins in the time of the last war with England, but was
never used, I believe, and so they left it to decay. I had visited the
place once when we lived in New York, as long ago almost as I could
remember, with my father, and an uncle of mine, an old sea-captain,
with white hair, who used to sail to a place called Archangel in
Russia, and who used to tell me that he was with Captain Langsdorff,
when Captain Langsdorff crossed over by land from the sea of Okotsk in
Asia to St. Petersburgh, drawn by large dogs in a sled. I mention this
of my uncle, because he was the very first sea-captain I had ever seen,
and his white hair and fine handsome florid face made so strong an
impression upon me, that I have never forgotten him, though I only saw
him during this one visit of his to New York, for he was lost in the
White Sea some years after.

But I meant to speak about the fort. It was a beautiful place, as I
remembered it, and very wonderful and romantic, too, as it appeared to
me, when I went there with my uncle. On the side away from the water
was a green grove of trees, very thick and shady; and through this
grove, in a sort of twilight you came to an arch in the wall of the
fort, dark as night; and going in, you groped about in long vaults,
twisting and turning on every side, till at last you caught a peep of
green grass and sunlight, and all at once came out in an open space in
the middle of the castle. And there you would see cows quietly grazing,
or ruminating under the shade of young trees, and perhaps a calf
frisking about, and trying to catch its own tail; and sheep clambering
among the mossy ruins, and cropping the little tufts of grass sprouting
out of the sides of the embrasures for cannon. And once I saw a black
goat with a long beard, and crumpled horns, standing with his forefeet
lifted high up on the topmost parapet, and looking to sea, as if he
were watching for a ship that was bringing over his cousin. I can see
him even now, and though I have changed since then, the black goat
looks just the same as ever; and so I suppose he would, if I live to be
as old as Methusaleh, and have as great a memory as he must have had.
Yes, the fort was a beautiful, quiet, charming spot. I should like to
build a little cottage in the middle of it, and live there all my life.
It was noon-day when I was there, in the month of June, and there was
little wind to stir the trees, and every thing looked as if it was
waiting for something, and the sky overhead was blue as my mother’s
eye, and I was so glad and happy then. But I must not think of those
delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt, and died, and we
removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises
up in my throat and almost strangles me.

Now, as we sailed through the Narrows, I caught sight of that beautiful
fort on the cliff, and could not help contrasting my situation now,
with what it was when with my father and uncle I went there so long
ago. Then I never thought of working for my living, and never knew that
there were hard hearts in the world; and knew so little of money, that
when I bought a stick of candy, and laid down a sixpence, I thought the
confectioner returned five cents, only that I might have money to buy
something else, and not because the pennies were my change, and
therefore mine by good rights. How different my idea of money now!

Then I was a schoolboy, and thought of going to college in time; and
had vague thoughts of becoming a great orator like Patrick Henry, whose
speeches I used to speak on the stage; but now, I was a poor friendless
boy, far away from my home, and voluntarily in the way of becoming a
miserable sailor for life. And what made it more bitter to me, was to
think of how well off were my cousins, who were happy and rich, and
lived at home with my uncles and aunts, with no thought of going to sea
for a living. I tried to think that it was all a dream, that I was not
where I was, not on board of a ship, but that I was at home again in
the city, with my father alive, and my mother bright and happy as she
used to be. But it would not do. I was indeed where I was, and here was
the ship, and there was the fort. So, after casting a last look at some
boys who were standing on the parapet, gazing off to sea, I turned away
heavily, and resolved not to look at the land any more.

About sunset we got fairly “outside,” and well may it so be called; for
I felt thrust out of the world. Then the breeze began to blow, and the
sails were loosed, and hoisted; and after a while, the steamboat left
us, and for the first time I felt the ship roll, a strange feeling
enough, as if it were a great barrel in the water. Shortly after, I
observed a swift little schooner running across our bows, and
re-crossing again and again; and while I was wondering what she could
be, she suddenly lowered her sails, and two men took hold of a little
boat on her deck, and launched it overboard as if it had been a chip.
Then I noticed that our pilot, a red-faced man in a rough blue coat,
who to my astonishment had all this time been giving orders instead of
the captain, began to button up his coat to the throat, like a prudent
person about leaving a house at night in a lonely square, to go home;
and he left the giving orders to the chief mate, and stood apart
talking with the captain, and put his hand into his pocket, and gave
him some newspapers.

And in a few minutes, when we had stopped our headway, and allowed the
little boat to come alongside, he shook hands with the captain and
officers and bade them good-by, without saying a syllable of farewell
to me and the sailors; and so he went laughing over the side, and got
into the boat, and they pulled him off to the schooner, and then the
schooner made sail and glided under our stern, her men standing up and
waving their hats, and cheering; and that was the last we saw of
America.




CHAPTER VIII.
HE IS PUT INTO THE LARBOARD WATCH; GETS SEA-SICK; AND RELATES SOME
OTHER OF HIS EXPERIENCES


It was now getting dark, when all at once the sailors were ordered on
the quarter-deck, and of course I went along with them.

What is to come now, thought I; but I soon found out. It seemed we were
going to be divided into watches. The chief mate began by selecting a
stout good-looking sailor for his watch; and then the second mate’s
turn came to choose, and he also chose a stout good-looking sailor. But
it was not me;— no; and _I_ noticed, as they went on choosing, one
after the other in regular rotation, that both of the mates never so
much as looked at me, but kept going round among the rest, peering into
their faces, for it was dusk, and telling them not to hide themselves
away so in their jackets. But the sailors, especially the stout
good-looking ones, seemed to make a point of lounging as much out of
the way as possible, and slouching their hats over their eyes; and
although it may only be a fancy of mine, _I_ certainly thought that
they affected a sort of lordly indifference as to whose watch they were
going to be in; and did not think it worth while to look any way
anxious about the matter. And the very men who, a few minutes before,
had showed the most alacrity and promptitude in jumping into the
rigging and running aloft at the word of command, now lounged against
the bulwarks and most lazily; as if they were quite sure, that by this
time the officers must know who the best men were, and they valued
themselves well enough to be willing to put the officers to the trouble
of searching them out; for if they were worth having, they were worth
seeking.

At last they were all chosen but me; and it was the chief mate’s next
turn to choose; though there could be little choosing in my case, since
_I_ was a thirteener, and must, whether or no, go over to the next
column, like the odd figure you carry along when you do a sum in
addition.

“Well, Buttons,” said the chief mate, “I thought I’d got rid of you.
And as it is, Mr. Rigs,” he added, speaking to the second mate, “I
guess you had better take him into your watch;—there, I’ll let you have
him, and then you’ll be one stronger than me.”

“No, I thank you,” said Mr. Rigs.

“You had better,” said the chief mate—“see, he’s not a bad looking
chap—he’s a little green, to be sure, but you were so once yourself,
you know, Rigs.”

“No, I thank you,” said the second mate again. “Take him yourself—he’s
yours by good rights—I don’t want him.” And so they put me in the chief
mate’s division, that is the larboard watch.

While this scene was going on, I felt shabby enough; there I stood,
just like a silly sheep, over whom two butchers are bargaining. Nothing
that had yet happened so forcibly reminded me of where I was, and what
I had come to. I was very glad when they sent us forward again.

As we were going forward, the second mate called one of the sailors by
name:-“You, Bill?” and Bill answered, “Sir?” just as if the second mate
was a born gentleman. It surprised me not a little, to see a man in
such a shabby, shaggy old jacket addressed so respectfully; but I had
been quite as much surprised when I heard the chief mate call him _Mr._
Rigs during the scene on the quarter-deck; as if this _Mr. Rigs_ was a
great merchant living in a marble house in Lafayette Place. But I was
not very long in finding out, that at sea all officers are _Misters,_
and would take it for an insult if any seaman presumed to omit calling
them so. And it is also one of their rights and privileges to be called
_sir_ when addressed—Yes, _sir; No, sir; Ay, ay, sir;_ and they are as
particular about being sirred as so many knights and baronets; though
their titles are not hereditary, as is the case with the Sir Johns and
Sir Joshuas in England. But so far as the second mate is concerned, his
tides are the only dignities he enjoys; for, upon the whole, he leads a
puppyish life indeed. He is not deemed company at any time for the
captain, though the chief mate occasionally is, at least deck-company,
though not in the cabin; and besides this, the second mate has to
breakfast, lunch, dine, and sup off the leavings of the cabin table,
and even the steward, who is accountable to nobody but the captain,
sometimes treats him cavalierly; and he has to run aloft when topsails
are reefed; and put his hand a good way down into the tar-bucket; and
keep the key of the boatswain’s locker, and fetch and carry balls of
marline and seizing-stuff for the sailors when at work in the rigging;
besides doing many other things, which a true-born baronet of any
spirit would rather die and give up his title than stand.

Having been divided into watches we were sent to supper; but I could
not eat any thing except a little biscuit, though I should have liked
to have some good tea; but as I had no pot to get it in, and was rather
nervous about asking the rough sailors to let me drink out of theirs; I
was obliged to go without a sip. I thought of going to the black cook
and begging a tin cup; but he looked so cross and ugly then, that the
sight of him almost frightened the idea out of me.

When supper was over, for they never talk about going to _tea_ aboard
of a ship, the watch to which I belonged was called on deck; and we
were told it was for us to stand the first night watch, that is, from
eight o’clock till midnight.

I now began to feel unsettled and ill at ease about the stomach, as if
matters were all topsy-turvy there; and felt strange and giddy about
the head; and so I made no doubt that this was the beginning of that
dreadful thing, the sea-sickness. Feeling worse and worse, I told one
of the sailors how it was with me, and begged him to make my excuses
very civilly to the chief mate, for I thought I would go below and
spend the night in my bunk. But he only laughed at me, and said
something about my mother not being aware of my being out; which
enraged me not a little, that a man whom I had heard swear so terribly,
should dare to take such a holy name into his mouth. It seemed a sort
of blasphemy, and it seemed like dragging out the best and most
cherished secrets of my soul, for at that time the name of mother was
the center of all my heart’s finest feelings, which ere that, I had
learned to keep secret, deep down in my being.

But I did not outwardly resent the sailor’s words, for that would have
only made the matter worse.

Now this man was a Greenlander by birth, with a very white skin where
the sun had not burnt it, and handsome blue eyes placed wide apart in
his head, and a broad good-humored face, and plenty of curly flaxen
hair. He was not very tall, but exceedingly stout-built, though active;
and his back was as broad as a shield, and it was a great way between
his shoulders. He seemed to be a sort of lady’s sailor, for in his
broken English he was always talking about the nice ladies of his
acquaintance in Stockholm and Copenhagen and a place he called the
Hook, which at first I fancied must be the place where lived the
hook-nosed men that caught fowling-pieces and every other article that
came along. He was dressed very tastefully, too, as if he knew he was a
good-looking fellow. He had on a new blue woolen Havre frock, with a
new silk handkerchief round his neck, passed through one of the
vertebral bones of a shark, highly polished and carved. His trowsers
were of clear white duck, and he sported a handsome pair of pumps, and
a tarpaulin hat bright as a looking-glass, with a long black ribbon
streaming behind, and getting entangled every now and then in the
rigging; and he had gold anchors in his ears, and a silver ring on one
of his fingers, which was very much worn and bent from pulling ropes
and other work on board ship. I thought he might better have left his
jewelry at home.

It was a long time before I could believe that this man was really from
Greenland, though he looked strange enough to me, then, to have come
from the moon; and he was full of stories about that distant country;
how they passed the winters there; and how bitter cold it was; and how
he used to go to bed and sleep twelve hours, and get up again and run
about, and go to bed again, and get up again—there was no telling how
many times, and all in one night; for in the winter time in his
country, he said, the nights were so many weeks long, that a Greenland
baby was sometimes three months old, before it could properly be said
to be a day old.

I had seen mention made of such things before, in books of voyages; but
that was only reading about them, just as you read the Arabian Nights,
which no one ever believes; for somehow, when I read about these
wonderful countries, I never used really to believe what I read, but
only thought it very strange, and a good deal too strange to be
altogether true; though I never thought the men who wrote the book
meant to tell lies. But I don’t know exactly how to explain what I
mean; but this much I will say, that I never believed in Greenland till
I saw this Greenlander. And at first, hearing him talk about Greenland,
only made me still more incredulous. For what business had a man from
Greenland to be in my company? Why was he not at home among the
icebergs, and how could he stand a warm summer’s sun, and not be melted
away? Besides, instead of icicles, there were ear-rings hanging from
his ears; and he did not wear bear-skins, and keep his hands in a huge
muff; things, which I could not help connecting with Greenland and all
Greenlanders.

But I was telling about my being sea-sick and wanting to retire for the
night. This Greenlander seeing I was ill, volunteered to turn doctor
and cure me; so going down into the forecastle, he came back with a
brown jug, like a molasses jug, and a little tin cannikin, and as soon
as the brown jug got near my nose, I needed no telling what was in it,
for it smelt like a still-house, and sure enough proved to be full of
Jamaica spirits.

“Now, Buttons,” said he, “one little dose of this will be better for
you than a whole night’s sleep; there, take that now, and then eat
seven or eight biscuits, and you’ll feel as strong as the mainmast.”

But I felt very little like doing as I was bid, for I had some scruples
about drinking spirits; and to tell the plain truth, for I am not
ashamed of it, I was a member of a society in the village where my
mother lived, called the Juvenile Total Abstinence Association, of
which my friend, Tom Legare, was president, secretary, and treasurer,
and kept the funds in a little purse that his cousin knit for him.
There was three and sixpence on hand, I believe, the last time he
brought in his accounts, on a May day, when we had a meeting in a grove
on the river-bank. Tom was a very honest treasurer, and never spent the
Society’s money for peanuts; and besides all, was a fine, generous boy,
whom I much loved. But I must not talk about Tom now.

When the Greenlander came to me with his jug of medicine, I thanked him
as well as I could; for just then I was leaning with my mouth over the
side, feeling ready to die; but I managed to tell him I was under a
solemn obligation never to drink spirits upon any consideration
whatever; though, as I had a sort of presentiment that the spirits
would now, for once in my life, do me good, I began to feel sorry, that
when I signed the pledge of abstinence, I had not taken care to insert
a little clause, allowing me to drink spirits in case of sea-sickness.
And I would advise temperance people to attend to this matter in
future; and then if they come to go to sea, there will be no need of
breaking their pledges, which I am truly sorry to say was the case with
me. And a hard thing it was, too, thus to break a vow before unbroken;
especially as the Jamaica tasted any thing but agreeable, and indeed
burnt my mouth so, that I did not relish my meals for some time after.
Even when I had become quite well and strong again, I wondered how the
sailors could really like such stuff; but many of them had a jug of it,
besides the Greenlander, which they brought along to sea with them, _to
taper off with,_ as they called it. But this tapering off did not last
very long, for the Jamaica was all gone on the second day, and the jugs
were tossed overboard. I wonder where they are now?

But to tell the truth, I found, in spite of its sharp taste, the
spirits I drank was just the thing I needed; but I suppose, if I could
have had a cup of nice hot coffee, it would have done quite as well,
and perhaps much better. But that was not to be had at that time of
night, or, indeed, at any other time; for the thing they called
_coffee,_ which was given to us every morning at breakfast, was the
most curious tasting drink I ever drank, and tasted as little like
coffee, as it did like lemonade; though, to be sure, it was generally
as cold as lemonade, and I used to think the cook had an icehouse, and
dropt ice into his coffee. But what was more curious still, was the
different quality and taste of it on different mornings. Sometimes it
tasted fishy, as if it was a decoction of Dutch herrings; and then it
would taste very salty, as if some _old horse,_ or sea-beef, had been
boiled in it; and then again it would taste a sort of cheesy, as if the
captain had sent his cheese-parings forward to make our coffee of; and
yet another time it would have such a very bad flavor, that I was
almost ready to think some old stocking-heels had been boiled in it.
What under heaven it was made of, that it had so many different bad
flavors, always remained a mystery; for when at work at his vocation,
our old cook used to keep himself close shut-up in his caboose, a
little cook-house, and never told any of his secrets.

Though a very serious character, as I shall hereafter show, he was for
all that, and perhaps for that identical reason, a very suspicious
looking sort of a cook, that I don’t believe would ever succeed in
getting the cooking at Delmonico’s in New York. It was well for him
that he was a black cook, for I have no doubt his color kept us from
seeing his dirty face! I never saw him wash but once, and that was at
one of his own soup pots one dark night when he thought no one saw him.
What induced him to be washing his face then, I never could find out;
but I suppose he must have suddenly waked up, after dreaming about some
real estate on his cheeks. As for his coffee, notwithstanding the
disagreeableness of its flavor, I always used to have a strange
curiosity every morning, to see what new taste it was going to have;
and though, sure enough, I never missed making a new discovery, and
adding another taste to my palate, I never found that there was any
change in the badness of the beverage, which always seemed the same in
that respect as before.

It may well be believed, then, that now when I was seasick, a cup of
such coffee as our old cook made would have done me no good, if indeed
it would not have come near making an end of me. And bad as it was, and
since it was not to be had at that time of night, as I said before, I
think I was excusable in taking something else in place of it, as I
did; and under the circumstances, it would be unhandsome of them, if my
fellow-members of the Temperance Society should reproach me for
breaking my bond, which I would not have done except in case of
necessity. But the evil effect of breaking one’s bond upon any occasion
whatever, was witnessed in the present case; for it insidiously opened
the way to subsequent breaches of it, which though very slight, yet
carried no apology with them.




CHAPTER IX.
THE SAILORS BECOMING A LITTLE SOCIAL, REDBURN CONVERSES WITH THEM


The latter part of this first long watch that we stood was very
pleasant, so far as the weather was concerned. From being rather
cloudy, it became a soft moonlight; and the stars peeped out, plain
enough to count one by one; and there was a fine steady breeze; and it
was not very cold; and we were going through the water almost as smooth
as a sled sliding down hill. And what was still better, the wind held
so steady, that there was little running aloft, little pulling ropes,
and scarcely any thing disagreeable of that kind.

The chief mate kept walking up and down the quarter-deck, with a
lighted long-nine cigar in his mouth by way of a torch; and spoke but
few words to us the whole watch. He must have had a good deal of
thinking to attend to, which in truth is the case with most seamen the
first night out of port, especially when they have thrown away their
money in foolish dissipation, and got very sick into the bargain. For
when ashore, many of these sea-officers are as wild and reckless in
their way, as the sailors they command.

While I stood watching the red cigar-end promenading up and down, the
mate suddenly stopped and gave an order, and the men sprang to obey it.
It was not much, only something about hoisting one of the sails a
little higher up on the mast. The men took hold of the rope, and began
pulling upon it; the foremost man of all setting up a song with no
words to it, only a strange musical rise and fall of notes. In the dark
night, and far out upon the lonely sea, it sounded wild enough, and
made me feel as I had sometimes felt, when in a twilight room a cousin
of mine, with black eyes, used to play some old German airs on the
piano. I almost looked round for goblins, and felt just a little bit
afraid. But I soon got used to this singing; for the sailors never
touched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one happened to strike
up, and the pulling, whatever it might be, did not seem to be getting
forward very well, the mate would always say, _“Come, men, can’t any of
you sing? Sing now, and raise the dead.”_ And then some one of them
would begin, and if every man’s arms were as much relieved as mine by
the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a
cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath
expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing
well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal
of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a
man, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope.

During the greater part of the watch, the sailors sat on the windlass
and told long stories of their adventures by sea and land, and talked
about Gibraltar, and Canton, and Valparaiso, and Bombay, just as you
and I would about Peck Slip and the Bowery. Every man of them almost
was a volume of Voyages and Travels round the World. And what most
struck me was that like books of voyages they often contradicted each
other, and would fall into long and violent disputes about who was
keeping the Foul Anchor tavern in Portsmouth at such a time; or whether
the King of Canton lived or did not live in Persia; or whether the
bar-maid of a particular house in Hamburg had black eyes or blue eyes;
with many other mooted points of that sort.

At last one of them went below and brought up a box of cigars from his
chest, for some sailors always provide little delicacies of that kind,
to break off the first shock of the salt water after laying idle
ashore; and also by way of _tapering off,_ as I mentioned a little
while ago. But I wondered that they never carried any pies and tarts to
sea with them, instead of spirits and cigars.

Ned, for that was the man’s name, split open the box with a blow of his
fist, and then handed it round along the windlass, just like a waiter
at a party, every one helping himself. But I was a member of an
Anti-Smoking Society that had been organized in our village by the
Principal of the Sunday School there, in conjunction with the
Temperance Association. So I did not smoke any then, though I did
afterward upon the voyage, I am sorry to say. Notwithstanding I
declined; with a good deal of unnecessary swearing, Ned assured me that
the cigars were real genuine Havannas; for he had been in Havanna, he
said, and had them made there under his own eye. According to his
account, he was very particular about his cigars and other things, and
never made any importations, for they were unsafe; but always made a
voyage himself direct to the place where any foreign thing was to be
had that he wanted. He went to Havre for his woolen shirts, to Panama
for his hats, to China for his silk handkerchiefs, and direct to
Calcutta for his cheroots; and as a great joker in the watch used to
say, no doubt he would at last have occasion to go to Russia for his
halter; the wit of which saying was presumed to be in the fact, that
the Russian hemp is the best; though that is not wit which needs
explaining.

By dint of the spirits which, besides stimulating my fainting strength,
united with the cool air of the sea to give me an appetite for our hard
biscuit; and also by dint of walking briskly up and down the deck
before the windlass, I had now recovered in good part from my sickness,
and finding the sailors all very pleasant and sociable, at least among
themselves, and seated smoking together like old cronies, and nothing
on earth to do but sit the watch out, I began to think that they were a
pretty good set of fellows after all, barring their swearing and
another ugly way of talking they had; and I thought I had misconceived
their true characters; for at the outset I had deemed them such a
parcel of wicked hard-hearted rascals that it would be a severe
affliction to associate with them.

Yes, I now began to look on them with a sort of incipient love; but
more with an eye of pity and compassion, as men of naturally gentle and
kind dispositions, whom only hardships, and neglect, and ill-usage had
made outcasts from good society; and not as villains who loved
wickedness for the sake of it, and would persist in wickedness, even in
Paradise, if they ever got there. And I called to mind a sermon I had
once heard in a church in behalf of sailors, when the preacher called
them strayed lambs from the fold, and compared them to poor lost
children, babes in the wood, orphans without fathers or mothers.

And I remembered reading in a magazine, called the Sailors’ Magazine,
with a sea-blue cover, and a ship painted on the back, about pious
seamen who never swore, and paid over all their wages to the poor
heathen in India; and how that when they were too old to go to sea,
these pious old sailors found a delightful home for life in the
Hospital, where they had nothing to do, but prepare themselves for
their latter end. And I wondered whether there were any such good
sailors among my ship-mates; and observing that one of them laid on
deck apart from the rest, I thought to be sure he must be one of them:
so I did not disturb his devotions: but I was afterward shocked at
discovering that he was only fast asleep, with one of the brown jugs by
his side.

I forgot to mention by the way, that every once in a while, the men
went into one corner, where the chief mate could not see them, to take
a “swig at the halyards,” as they called it; and this swigging at the
halyards it was, that enabled them “to taper off” handsomely, and no
doubt it was this, too, that had something to do with making them so
pleasant and sociable that night, for they were seldom so pleasant and
sociable afterward, and never treated me so kindly as they did then.
Yet this might have been owing to my being something of a stranger to
them, then; and our being just out of port. But that very night they
turned about, and taught me a bitter lesson; but all in good time.

I have said, that seeing how agreeable they were getting, and how
friendly their manner was, I began to feel a sort of compassion for
them, grounded on their sad conditions as amiable outcasts; and feeling
so warm an interest in them, and being full of pity, and being truly
desirous of benefiting them to the best of my poor powers, for I knew
they were but poor indeed, I made bold to ask one of them, whether he
was ever in the habit of going to church, when he was ashore, or
dropping in at the Floating Chapel I had seen lying off the dock in the
East River at New York; and whether he would think it too much of a
liberty, if I asked him, if he had any good books in his chest. He
stared a little at first, but marking what good language I used, seeing
my civil bearing toward him, he seemed for a moment to be filled with a
certain involuntary respect for me, and answered, that he had been to
church once, some ten or twelve years before, in London, and on a
week-day had helped to move the Floating Chapel round the Battery, from
the North River; and that was the only time he had seen it. For his
books, he said he did not know what I meant by good books; but if I
wanted the Newgate Calendar, and Pirate’s Own, he could lend them to
me.

When I heard this poor sailor talk in this manner, showing so plainly
his ignorance and absence of proper views of religion, I pitied him
more and more, and contrasting my own situation with his, I was
grateful that I was different from him; and I thought how pleasant it
was, to feel wiser and better than he could feel; though I was willing
to confess to myself, that it was not altogether my own good endeavors,
so much as my education, which I had received from others, that had
made me the upright and sensible boy I at that time thought myself to
be. And it was now, that I began to feel a good degree of complacency
and satisfaction in surveying my own character; for, before this, I had
previously associated with persons of a very discreet life, so that
there was little opportunity to magnify myself, by comparing myself
with my neighbors.

Thinking that my superiority to him in a moral way might sit uneasily
upon this sailor, I thought it would soften the matter down by giving
him a chance to show his own superiority to me, in a minor thing; for I
was far from being vain and conceited.

Having observed that at certain intervals a little bell was rung on the
quarter-deck by the man at the wheel; and that as soon as it was heard,
some one of the sailors forward struck a large bell which hung on the
forecastle; and having observed that how many times soever the man
astern rang his bell, the man forward struck his—tit for tat,—I
inquired of this Floating Chapel sailor, what all this ringing meant;
and whether, as the big bell hung right over the scuttle that went down
to the place where the watch below were sleeping, such a ringing every
little while would not tend to disturb them and beget unpleasant
dreams; and in asking these questions I was particular to address him
in a civil and condescending way, so as to show him very plainly that I
did not deem myself one whit better than he was, that is, taking all
things together, and not going into particulars. But to my great
surprise and mortification, he in the rudest land of manner laughed
aloud in my face, and called me a “Jimmy Dux,” though that was not my
real name, and he must have known it; and also the “son of a farmer,”
though as I have previously related, my father was a great merchant and
French importer in Broad-street in New York. And then he began to laugh
and joke about me, with the other sailors, till they all got round me,
and if I had not felt so terribly angry, I should certainly have felt
very much like a fool. But my being so angry prevented me from feeling
foolish, which is very lucky for people in a passion.




CHAPTER X.
HE IS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED; THE SAILORS ABUSE HIM; AND HE BECOMES
MISERABLE AND FORLORN


While the scene last described was going on, we were all startled by a
horrid groaning noise down in the forecastle; and all at once some one
came rushing up the scuttle in his shirt, clutching something in his
hand, and trembling and shrieking in the most frightful manner, so that
I thought one of the sailors must be murdered below.

But it all passed in a moment; and while we stood aghast at the sight,
and almost before we knew what it was, the shrieking man jumped over
the bows into the sea, and we saw him no more. Then there was a great
uproar; the sailors came running up on deck; and the chief mate ran
forward, and learning what had happened, began to yell out his orders
about the sails and yards; and we all went to pulling and hauling the
ropes, till at last the ship lay almost still on the water. Then they
loosed a boat, which kept pulling round the ship for more than an hour,
but they never caught sight of the man. It seemed that he was one of
the sailors who had been brought aboard dead drunk, and tumbled into
his bunk by his landlord; and there he had lain till now. He must have
suddenly waked up, I suppose, raging mad with the delirium tremens, as
the chief mate called it, and finding himself in a strange silent
place, and knowing not how he had got there, he rushed on deck, and so,
in a fit of frenzy, put an end to himself.

This event, happening at the dead of night, had a wonderfully solemn
and almost awful effect upon me. I would have given the whole world,
and the sun and moon, and all the stars in heaven, if they had been
mine, had I been safe back at Mr. Jones’, or still better, in my home
on the Hudson River. I thought it an ill-omened voyage, and railed at
the folly which had sent me to sea, sore against the advice of my best
friends, that is to say, my mother and sisters.

Alas! poor Wellingborough, thought I, you will never see your home any
more. And in this melancholy mood I went below, when the watch had
expired, which happened soon after. But to my terror, I found that the
suicide had been occupying the very bunk which I had appropriated to
myself, and there was no other place for me to sleep in. The thought of
lying down there now, seemed too horrible to me, and what made it
worse, was the way in which the sailors spoke of my being frightened.
And they took this opportunity to tell me what a hard and wicked life I
had entered upon, and how that such things happened frequently at sea,
and they were used to it. But I did not believe this; for when the
suicide came rushing and shrieking up the scuttle, they looked as
frightened as I did; and besides that, and what makes their being
frightened still plainer, is the fact, that if they had had any
presence of mind, they could have prevented his plunging overboard,
since he brushed right by them. However, they lay in their bunks
smoking, and kept talking on some time in this strain, and advising me
as soon as ever I got home to pin my ears back, so as not to hold the
wind, and sail straight away into the interior of the country, and
never stop until deep in the bush, far off from the least running
brook, never mind how shallow, and out of sight of even the smallest
puddle of rainwater.

This kind of talking brought the tears into my eyes, for it was so true
and real, and the sailors who spoke it seemed so false-hearted and
insincere; but for all that, in spite of the sickness at my heart, it
made me mad, and stung me to the quick, that they should speak of me as
a poor trembling coward, who could never be brought to endure the
hardships of a sailor’s life; for I felt myself trembling, and knew
that I was but a coward then, well enough, without their telling me of
it. And they did not say I was cowardly, because they perceived it in
me, but because they merely supposed I must be, judging, no doubt, from
their own secret thoughts about themselves; for I felt sure that the
suicide frightened them very badly. And at last, being provoked to
desperation by their taunts, I told them so to their faces; but I might
better have kept silent; for they now all united to abuse me. They
asked me what business I, a boy like me, had to go to sea, and take the
bread out of the mouth of honest sailors, and fill a good seaman’s
place; and asked me whether I ever dreamed of becoming a captain, since
I was a gentleman with white hands; and if I ever _should_ be, they
would like nothing better than to ship aboard my vessel and stir up a
mutiny. And one of them, whose name was Jackson, of whom I shall have a
good deal more to say by-and-by, said, I had better steer clear of him
ever after, for if ever I crossed his path, or got into his way, he
would be the death of me, and if ever I stumbled about in the rigging
near _him,_ he would make nothing of pitching me overboard; and that he
swore too, with an oath. At first, all this nearly stunned me, it was
so unforeseen; and then I could not believe that they meant what they
said, or that they could be so cruel and black-hearted. But how could I
help seeing, that the men who could thus talk to a poor, friendless
boy, on the very first night of his voyage to sea, must be capable of
almost any enormity. I loathed, detested, and hated them with all that
was left of my bursting heart and soul, and I thought myself the most
forlorn and miserable wretch that ever breathed. May I never be a man,
thought I, if to be a boy is to be such a wretch. And I wailed and
wept, and my heart cracked within me, but all the time I defied them
through my teeth, and dared them to do their worst.

At last they ceased talking and fell fast asleep, leaving me awake,
seated on a chest with my face bent over my knees between my hands. And
there I sat, till at length the dull beating against the ship’s bows,
and the silence around soothed me down, and I fell asleep as I sat.




CHAPTER XI.
HE HELPS WASH THE DECKS, AND THEN GOES TO BREAKFAST


The next thing I knew, was the loud thumping of a handspike on deck as
the watch was called again. It was now four o’clock in the morning, and
when we got on deck the first signs of day were shining in the east.
The men were very sleepy, and sat down on the windlass without
speaking, and some of them nodded and nodded, till at last they fell
off like little boys in church during a drowsy sermon. At last it was
broad day, and an order was given to wash down the decks. A great tub
was dragged into the waist, and then one of the men went over into the
chains, and slipped in behind a band fastened to the shrouds, and
leaning over, began to swing a bucket into the sea by a long rope; and
in that way with much expertness and sleight of hand, he managed to
fill the tub in a very short time. Then the water began to splash about
all over the decks, and I began to think I should surely get my feet
wet, and catch my death of cold. So I went to the chief mate, and told
him I thought I would just step below, till this miserable wetting was
over; for I did not have any water-proof boots, and an aunt of mine had
died of consumption. But he only roared out for me to get a broom and
go to scrubbing, or he would prove a worse consumption to me than ever
got hold of my poor aunt. So I scrubbed away fore and aft, till my back
was almost broke, for the brooms had uncommon short handles, and we
were told to scrub hard.

At length the scrubbing being over, the mate began heaving buckets of
water about, to wash every thing clean, by way of finishing off. He
must have thought this fine sport, just as captains of fire engines
love to point the tube of their hose; for he kept me running after him
with full buckets of water, and sometimes chased a little chip all over
the deck, with a continued flood, till at last he sent it flying out of
a scupper-hole into the sea; when if he had only given me permission, I
could have picked it up in a trice, and dropped it overboard without
saying one word, and without wasting so much water. But he said there
was plenty of water in the ocean, and to spare; which was true enough,
but then I who had to trot after him with the buckets, had no more legs
and arms than I wanted for my own use.

I thought this washing down the decks was the most foolish thing in the
world, and besides that it was the most uncomfortable. It was worse
than my mother’s house-cleanings at home, which I used to abominate so.

At eight o’clock the bell was struck, and we went to breakfast. And now
some of the worst of my troubles began. For not having had any friend
to tell me what I would want at sea, I had not provided myself, as I
should have done, with a good many things that a sailor needs; and for
my own part, it had never entered my mind, that sailors had no table to
sit down to, no cloth, or napkins, or tumblers, and had to provide
every thing themselves. But so it was.

The first thing they did was this. Every sailor went to the cook-house
with his tin pot, and got it filled with coffee; but of course, having
no pot, there was no coffee for me. And after that, a sort of little
tub called a “kid,” was passed down into the forecastle, filled with
something they called “burgoo.” This was like mush, made of Indian
corn, meal, and water. With the _“kid,” a_ little tin cannikin was
passed down with molasses. Then the Jackson that I spoke of before, put
the kid between his knees, and began to pour in the molasses, just like
an old landlord mixing punch for a party. He scooped out a little hole
in the middle of the mush, to hold the molasses; so it looked for all
the world like a little black pool in the Dismal Swamp of Virginia.

Then they all formed a circle round the kid; and one after the other,
with great regularity, dipped their spoons into the mush, and after
stirring them round a little in the molasses-pool, they swallowed down
their mouthfuls, and smacked their lips over it, as if it tasted very
good; which I have no doubt it did; but not having any spoon, I wasn’t
sure.

I sat some time watching these proceedings, and wondering how polite
they were to each other; for, though there were a great many spoons to
only one dish, they never got entangled. At last, seeing that the mush
was getting thinner and thinner, and that it was getting low water, or
rather low molasses in the little pool, I ran on deck, and after
searching about, returned with a bit of stick; and thinking I had as
good a right as any one else to the mush and molasses, I worked my way
into the circle, intending to make one of the party. So I shoved in my
stick, and after twirling it about, was just managing to carry a little
_burgoo_ toward my mouth, which had been for some time standing ready
open to receive it, when one of the sailors perceiving what I was
about, knocked the stick out of my hands, and asked me where I learned
my manners; Was that the way gentlemen eat in my country? Did they eat
their victuals with splinters of wood, and couldn’t that wealthy
gentleman my father afford to buy his gentlemanly son a spoon?

All the rest joined in, and pronounced me an ill-bred, coarse, and
unmannerly youngster, who, if permitted to go on with such behavior as
that, would corrupt the whole crew, and make them no better than swine.

As I felt conscious that a stick was indeed a thing very unsuitable to
eat with, I did not say much to this, though it vexed me enough; but
remembering that I had seen one of the steerage passengers with a pan
and spoon in his hand eating his breakfast on the fore hatch, I now ran
on deck again, and to my great joy succeeded in borrowing his spoon,
for he had got through his meal, and down I came again, though at the
eleventh hour, and offered myself once more as a candidate.

But alas! there was little more of the Dismal Swamp left, and when I
reached over to the opposite end of the kid, I received a rap on the
knuckles from a spoon, and was told that I must help myself from my own
side, for that was the rule. But _my_ side was scraped clean, so I got
no _burgoo_ that morning.

But I made it up by eating some salt beef and biscuit, which I found to
be the invariable accompaniment of every meal; the sailors sitting
cross-legged on their chests in a circle, and breaking the hard
biscuit, very sociably, over each other’s heads, which was very
convenient indeed, but gave me the headache, at least for the first
four or five days till I got used to it; and then I did not care much
about it, only it kept my hair full of crumbs; and I had forgot to
bring a fine comb and brush, so I used to shake my hair out to windward
over the bulwarks every evening.




CHAPTER XII.
HE GIVES SOME ACCOUNT OF ONE OF HIS SHIPMATES CALLED JACKSON


While we sat eating our beef and biscuit, two of the men got into a
dispute, about who had been sea-faring the longest; when Jackson, who
had mixed the _burgoo,_ called upon them in a loud voice to cease their
clamor, for he would decide the matter for them. Of this sailor, I
shall have something more to say, as I get on with my narrative; so, I
will here try to describe him a little.

Did you ever see a man, with his hair shaved off, and just recovered
from the yellow fever? Well, just such a looking man was this sailor.
He was as yellow as gamboge, had no more whisker on his cheek, than I
have on my elbows. His hair had fallen out, and left him very bald,
except in the nape of his neck, and just behind the ears, where it was
stuck over with short little tufts, and looked like a worn-out
shoe-brush. His nose had broken down in the middle, and he squinted
with one eye, and did not look very straight out of the other. He
dressed a good deal like a Bowery boy; for he despised the ordinary
sailor-rig; wearing a pair of great over-all blue trowsers, fastened
with suspenders, and three red woolen shirts, one over the other; for
he was subject to the rheumatism, and was not in good health, he said;
and he had a large white wool hat, with a broad rolling brim. He was a
native of New York city, and had a good deal to say about
_highlanders,_ and _rowdies,_ whom he denounced as only good for the
gallows; but I thought he looked a good deal like a _highlander_
himself.

His name, as I have said, was Jackson; and he told us, he was a near
relation of General Jackson of New Orleans, and swore terribly, if any
one ventured to question what he asserted on that head. In fact he was
a great bully, and being the best seaman on board, and very overbearing
every way, all the men were afraid of him, and durst not contradict
him, or cross his path in any thing. And what made this more wonderful
was, that he was the weakest man, bodily, of the whole crew; and I have
no doubt that young and small as I was then, compared to what I am now,
I could have thrown him down. But he had such an overawing way with
him; such a deal of brass and impudence, such an unflinching face, and
withal was such a hideous looking mortal, that Satan himself would have
run from him. And besides all this, it was quite plain, that he was by
nature a marvelously clever, cunning man, though without education; and
understood human nature to a kink, and well knew whom he had to deal
with; and then, one glance of his squinting eye, was as good as a
knock-down, for it was the most deep, subtle, infernal looking eye,
that I ever saw lodged in a human head. I believe, that by good rights
it must have belonged to a wolf, or starved tiger; at any rate, I would
defy any oculist, to turn out a glass eye, half so cold, and snaky, and
deadly. It was a horrible thing; and I would give much to forget that I
have ever seen it; for it haunts me to this day.

It was impossible to tell how old this Jackson was; for he had no
beard, and no wrinkles, except small crowsfeet about the eyes. He might
have seen thirty, or perhaps fifty years. But according to his own
account, he had been to sea ever since he was eight years old, when he
first went as a cabin-boy in an Indiaman, and ran away at Calcutta. And
according to his own account, too, he had passed through every kind of
dissipation and abandonment in the worst parts of the world. He had
served in Portuguese slavers on the coast of Africa; and with a
diabolical relish used to tell of the _middle-passage,_ where the
slaves were stowed, heel and point, like logs, and the suffocated and
dead were unmanacled, and weeded out from the living every morning,
before washing down the decks; how he had been in a slaving schooner,
which being chased by an English cruiser off Cape Verde, received three
shots in her hull, which raked through and through a whole file of
slaves, that were chained.

He would tell of lying in Batavia during a fever, when his ship lost a
man every few days, and how they went reeling ashore with the body, and
got still more intoxicated by way of precaution against the plague. He
would talk of finding a cobra-di-capello, or hooded snake, under his
pillow in India, when he slept ashore there. He would talk of sailors
being poisoned at Canton with drugged _“shampoo,”_ for the sake of
their money; and of the Malay ruffians, who stopped ships in the
straits of Caspar, and always saved the captain for the last, so as to
make him point out where the most valuable goods were stored.

His whole talk was of this land; full of piracies, plagues and
poisonings. And often he narrated many passages in his own individual
career, which were almost incredible, from the consideration that few
men could have plunged into such infamous vices, and clung to them so
long, without paying the death-penalty.

But in truth, he carried about with him the traces of these things, and
the mark of a fearful end nigh at hand; like that of King Antiochus of
Syria, who died a worse death, history says, than if he had been stung
out of the world by wasps and hornets.

Nothing was left of this Jackson but the foul lees and dregs of a man;
he was thin as a shadow; nothing but skin and bones; and sometimes used
to complain, that it hurt him to sit on the hard chests. And I
sometimes fancied, it was the consciousness of his miserable,
broken-down condition, and the prospect of soon dying like a dog, in
consequence of his sins, that made this poor wretch always eye me with
such malevolence as he did. For I was young and handsome, at least my
mother so thought me, and as soon as I became a little used to the sea,
and shook off my low spirits somewhat, I began to have my old color in
my cheeks, and, spite of misfortune, to appear well and hearty; whereas
_he_ was being consumed by an incurable malady, that was eating up his
vitals, and was more fit for a hospital than a ship.

As I am sometimes by nature inclined to indulge in unauthorized
surmisings about the thoughts going on with regard to me, in the people
I meet; especially if I have reason to think they dislike me; I will
not put it down for a certainty that what I suspected concerning this
Jackson relative to his thoughts of me, was really the truth. But only
state my honest opinion, and how it struck me at the time; and even
now, I think I was not wrong. And indeed, unless it was so, how could I
account to myself, for the shudder that would run through me, when I
caught this man gazing at me, as I often did; for he was apt to be dumb
at times, and would sit with his eyes fixed, and his teeth set, like a
man in the moody madness.

I well remember the first time I saw him, and how I was startled at his
eye, which was even then fixed upon me. He was standing at the ship’s
helm, being the first man that got there, when a steersman was called
for by the pilot; for this Jackson was always on the alert for easy
duties, and used to plead his delicate health as the reason for
assuming them, as he did; though I used to think, that for a man in
poor health, he was very swift on the legs; at least when a good place
was to be jumped to; though that might only have been a sort of
spasmodic exertion under strong inducements, which every one knows the
greatest invalids will sometimes show.

And though the sailors were always very bitter against any thing like
_sogering,_ as they called it; that is, any thing that savored of a
desire to get rid of downright hard work; yet, I observed that, though
this Jackson was a notorious old _soger_ the whole voyage (I mean, in
all things not perilous to do, from which he was far from hanging
back), and in truth was a great veteran that way, and one who must have
passed unhurt through many campaigns; yet, they never presumed to call
him to account in any way; or to let him so much as think, what they
thought of his conduct. But I often heard them call him many hard names
behind his back; and sometimes, too, when, perhaps, they had just been
tenderly inquiring after his health before his face. They all stood in
mortal fear of him; and cringed and fawned about him like so many
spaniels; and used to rub his back, after he was undressed and lying in
his bunk; and used to run up on deck to the cook-house, to warm some
cold coffee for him; and used to fill his pipe, and give him chews of
tobacco, and mend his jackets and trowsers; and used to watch, and
tend, and nurse him every way. And all the time, he would sit scowling
on them, and found fault with what they did; and I noticed, that those
who did the most for him, and cringed the most before him, were the
very ones he most abused; while two or three who held more aloof, he
treated with a little consideration.

It is not for me to say, what it was that made a whole ship’s company
submit so to the whims of one poor miserable man like Jackson. I only
know that so it was; but I have no doubt, that if he had had a blue eye
in his head, or had had a different face from what he did have, they
would not have stood in such awe of him. And it astonished me, to see
that one of the seamen, a remarkably robust and good-humored young man
from Belfast in Ireland, was a person of no mark or influence among the
crew; but on the contrary was hooted at, and trampled upon, and made a
butt and laughing-stock; and more than all, was continually being
abused and snubbed by Jackson, who seemed to hate him cordially,
because of his great strength and fine person, and particularly because
of his red cheeks.

But then, this Belfast man, although he had shipped for an
_able-seaman,_ was not much of a sailor; and that always lowers a man
in the eyes of a ship’s company; I mean, when he ships for an
_able-seaman,_ but is not able to do the duty of one. For sailors are
of three classes—_able-seaman, ordinary-seaman,_ and _boys;_ and they
receive different wages according to their rank. Generally, a ship’s
company of twelve men will only have five or six able seamen, who if
they prove to understand their duty every way (and that is no small
matter either, as I shall hereafter show, perhaps), are looked up to,
and thought much of by the ordinary-seamen and boys, who reverence
their very pea-jackets, and lay up their sayings in their hearts.

But you must not think from this, that persons called _boys_ aboard
merchant-ships are all youngsters, though to be sure, I myself was
called a _boy,_ and a boy I was. No. In merchant-ships, a _boy_ means a
green-hand, a landsman on his first voyage. And never mind if he is old
enough to be a grandfather, he is still called a _boy;_ and boys’ work
is put upon him.

But I am straying off from what I was going to say about Jackson’s
putting an end to the dispute between the two sailors in the forecastle
after breakfast. After they had been disputing some time about who had
been to sea the longest, Jackson told them to stop talking; and then
bade one of them open his mouth; for, said he, I can tell a sailor’s
age just like a horse’s—by his teeth. So the man laughed, and opened
his mouth; and Jackson made him step out under the scuttle, where the
light came down from deck; and then made him throw his head back, while
he looked into it, and probed a little with his jackknife, like a
baboon peering into a junk-bottle. I trembled for the poor fellow, just
as if I had seen him under the hands of a crazy barber, making signs to
cut his throat, and he all the while sitting stock still, with the
lather on, to be shaved. For I watched Jackson’s eye and saw it
snapping, and a sort of going in and out, very quick, as if it were
something like a forked tongue; and somehow, I felt as if he were
longing to kill the man; but at last he grew more composed, and after
concluding his examination, said, that the first man was the oldest
sailor, for the ends of his teeth were the evenest and most worn down;
which, he said, arose from eating so much hard sea-biscuit; and this
was the reason he could tell a sailor’s age like a horse’s.

At this, every body made merry, and looked at each other, as much as to
_say—come, boys, let’s laugh;_ and they did laugh; and declared it was
a rare joke.

This was always the way with them. They made a point of shouting out,
whenever Jackson said any thing with a grin; that being the sign to
them that he himself thought it funny; though I heard many good jokes
from others pass off without a smile; and once Jackson himself (for, to
tell the truth, he sometimes had a comical way with him, that is, when
his back did not ache) told a truly funny story, but with a grave face;
when, not knowing how he meant it, whether for a laugh or otherwise,
they all sat still, waiting what to do, and looking perplexed enough;
till at last Jackson roared out upon them for a parcel of fools and
idiots; and told them to their beards, how it was; that he had
purposely put on his grave face, to see whether they would not look
grave, too; even when he was telling something that ought to split
their sides. And with that, he flouted, and jeered at them, and laughed
them all to scorn; and broke out in such a rage, that his lips began to
glue together at the corners with a fine white foam.

He seemed to be full of hatred and gall against every thing and every
body in the world; as if all the world was one person, and had done him
some dreadful harm, that was rankling and festering in his heart.
Sometimes I thought he was really crazy; and often felt so frightened
at him, that I thought of going to the captain about it, and telling
him Jackson ought to be confined, lest he should do some terrible thing
at last. But upon second thoughts, I always gave it up; for the captain
would only have called me a fool, and sent me forward again.

But you must not think that all the sailors were alike in abasing
themselves before this man. No: there were three or four who used to
stand up sometimes against him; and when he was absent at the wheel,
would plot against him among the other sailors, and tell them what a
shame and ignominy it was, that such a poor miserable wretch should be
such a tyrant over much better men than himself. And they begged and
conjured them as men, to put up with it no longer, but the very next
time, that Jackson presumed to play the dictator, that they should all
withstand him, and let him know his place. Two or three times nearly
all hands agreed to it, with the exception of those who used to slink
off during such discussions; and swore that they would not any more
submit to being ruled by Jackson. But when the time came to make good
their oaths, they were mum again, and let every thing go on the old
way; so that those who had put them up to it, had to bear all the brunt
of Jackson’s wrath by themselves. And though these last would stick up
a little at first, and even mutter something about a fight to Jackson;
yet in the end, finding themselves unbefriended by the rest, they would
gradually become silent, and leave the field to the tyrant, who would
then fly out worse than ever, and dare them to do their worst, and jeer
at them for white-livered poltroons, who did not have a mouthful of
heart in them. At such times, there were no bounds to his contempt; and
indeed, all the time he seemed to have even more contempt than hatred,
for every body and every thing.

As for me, I was but a boy; and at any time aboard ship, a boy is
expected to keep quiet, do what he is bid, never presume to interfere,
and seldom to talk, unless spoken to. For merchant sailors have a great
idea of their dignity, and superiority to _greenhorns_ and _landsmen,_
who know nothing about a ship; and they seem to think, that an _able
seaman_ is a great man; at least a much greater man than a little boy.
And the able seamen in the Highlander had such grand notions about
their seamanship, that I almost thought that able seamen received
diplomas, like those given at colleges; and were made a sort _A.M.S,_
or _Masters of Arts._

But though I kept thus quiet, and had very little to say, and well knew
that my best plan was to get along peaceably with every body, and
indeed endure a good deal before showing fight, yet I could not avoid
Jackson’s evil eye, nor escape his bitter enmity. And his being my foe,
set many of the rest against me; or at least they were afraid to speak
out for me before Jackson; so that at last I found myself a sort of
Ishmael in the ship, without a single friend or companion; and I began
to feel a hatred growing up in me against the whole crew—so much so,
that I prayed against it, that it might not master my heart completely,
and so make a fiend of me, something like Jackson.




CHAPTER XIII.
HE HAS A FINE DAY AT SEA, BEGINS TO LIKE IT; BUT CHANGES HIS MIND


The second day out of port, the decks being washed down and breakfast
over, the watch was called, and the mate set us to work.

It was a very bright day. The sky and water were both of the same deep
hue; and the air felt warm and sunny; so that we threw off our jackets.
I could hardly believe that I was sailing in the same ship I had been
in during the night, when every thing had been so lonely and dim; and I
could hardly imagine that this was the same ocean, now so beautiful and
blue, that during part of the night-watch had rolled along so black and
forbidding.

There were little traces of sunny clouds all over the heavens; and
little fleeces of foam all over the sea; and the ship made a strange,
musical noise under her bows, as she glided along, with her sails all
still. It seemed a pity to go to work at such a time; and if we could
only have sat in the windlass again; or if they would have let me go
out on the bowsprit, and lay down between the _manropes_ there, and
look over at the fish in the water, and think of home, I should have
been almost happy for a time.

I had now completely got over my sea-sickness, and felt very well; at
least in my body, though my heart was far from feeling right; so that I
could now look around me, and make observations.

And truly, though we were at sea, there was much to behold and wonder
at; to me, who was on my first voyage. What most amazed me was the
sight of the great ocean itself, for we were out of sight of land. All
round us, on both sides of the ship, ahead and astern, nothing was to
be seen but water—water—water; not a single glimpse of green shore, not
the smallest island, or speck of moss any where. Never did I realize
till now what the ocean was: how grand and majestic, how solitary, and
boundless, and beautiful and blue; for that day it gave no tokens of
squalls or hurricanes, such as I had heard my father tell of; nor could
I imagine, how any thing that seemed so playful and placid, could be
lashed into rage, and troubled into rolling avalanches of foam, and
great cascades of waves, such as I saw in the end.

As I looked at it so mild and sunny, I could not help calling to mind
my little brother’s face, when he was sleeping an infant in the cradle.
It had just such a happy, careless, innocent look; and every happy
little wave seemed gamboling about like a thoughtless little kid in a
pasture; and seemed to look up in your face as it passed, as if it
wanted to be patted and caressed. They seemed all live things with
hearts in them, that could feel; and I almost felt grieved, as we
sailed in among them, scattering them under our broad bows in
sun-flakes, and riding over them like a great elephant among lambs. But
what seemed perhaps the most strange to me of all, was a certain
wonderful rising and falling of the sea; I do not mean the waves
themselves, but a sort of wide heaving and swelling and sinking all
over the ocean. It was something I can not very well describe; but I
know very well what it was, and how it affected me. It made me almost
dizzy to look at it; and yet I could not keep my eyes off it, it seemed
so passing strange and wonderful.

I felt as if in a dream all the time; and when I could shut the ship
out, almost thought I was in some new, fairy world, and expected to
hear myself called to, out of the clear blue air, or from the depths of
the deep blue sea. But I did not have much leisure to indulge in such
thoughts; for the men were now getting some _stun’-sails_ ready to
hoist aloft, as the wind was getting fairer and fairer for us; and
these stun’-sails are light canvas which are spread at such times, away
out beyond the ends of the yards, where they overhang the wide water,
like the wings of a great bird.

For my own part, I could do but little to help the rest, not knowing
the name of any thing, or the proper way to go about aught. Besides, I
felt very dreamy, as I said before; and did not exactly know where, or
what I was; every thing was so strange and new.

While the stun’-sails were lying all tumbled upon the deck, and the
sailors were fastening them to the booms, getting them ready to hoist,
the mate ordered me to do a great many simple things, none of which
could I comprehend, owing to the queer words he used; and then, seeing
me stand quite perplexed and confounded, he would roar out at me, and
call me all manner of names, and the sailors would laugh and wink to
each other, but durst not go farther than that, for fear of the mate,
who in his own presence would not let any body laugh at me but himself.

However, I tried to wake up as much as I could, and keep from dreaming
with my eyes open; and being, at bottom, a smart, apt lad, at last I
managed to learn a thing or two, so that I did not appear so much like
a fool as at first.

People who have never gone to sea for the first time as sailors, can
not imagine how puzzling and confounding it is. It must be like going
into a barbarous country, where they speak a strange dialect, and dress
in strange clothes, and live in strange houses. For sailors have their
own names, even for things that are familiar ashore; and if you call a
thing by its shore name, you are laughed at for an ignoramus and a
landlubber. This first day I speak of, the mate having ordered me to
draw some water, I asked him where I was to get the pail; when I
thought I had committed some dreadful crime; for he flew into a great
passion, and said they never had any _pails_ at sea, and then I learned
that they were always called _buckets._ And once I was talking about
sticking a little wooden peg into a bucket to stop a leak, when he flew
out again, and said there were no _pegs_ at sea, only _plugs._ And just
so it was with every thing else.

But besides all this, there is such an infinite number of totally new
names of new things to learn, that at first it seemed impossible for me
to master them all. If you have ever seen a ship, you must have
remarked what a thicket of ropes there are; and how they all seemed
mixed and entangled together like a great skein of yarn. Now the very
smallest of these ropes has its own proper name, and many of them are
very lengthy, like the names of young royal princes, such as the
_starboard-main-top-gallant-bow-line,_ or the
_larboard-fore-top-sail-clue-line._

I think it would not be a bad plan to have a grand new naming of a
ship’s ropes, as I have read, they once had a simplifying of the
classes of plants in Botany. It is really wonderful how many names
there are in the world. There is no counting the names, that surgeons
and anatomists give to the various parts of the human body; which,
indeed, is something like a ship; its bones being the stiff
standing-rigging, and the sinews the small running ropes, that manage
all the motions.

I wonder whether mankind could not get along without all these names,
which keep increasing every day, and hour, and moment; till at last the
very air will be full of them; and even in a great plain, men will be
breathing each other’s breath, owing to the vast multitude of words
they use, that consume all the air, just as lamp-burners do gas. But
people seem to have a great love for names; for to know a great many
names, seems to look like knowing a good many things; though I should
not be surprised, if there were a great many more names than things in
the world. But I must quit this rambling, and return to my story.

At last we hoisted the stun’-sails up to the top-sail yards, and as
soon as the vessel felt them, she gave a sort of bound like a horse,
and the breeze blowing more and more, she went plunging along, shaking
off the foam from her bows, like foam from a bridle-bit. Every mast and
timber seemed to have a pulse in it that was beating with life and joy;
and I felt a wild exulting in my own heart, and felt as if I would be
glad to bound along so round the world.

Then was I first conscious of a wonderful thing in me, that responded
to all the wild commotion of the outer world; and went reeling on and
on with the planets in their orbits, and was lost in one delirious
throb at the center of the All. A wild bubbling and bursting was at my
heart, as if a hidden spring had just gushed out there; and my blood
ran tingling along my frame, like mountain brooks in spring freshets.

Yes! yes! give me this glorious ocean life, this salt-sea life, this
briny, foamy life, when the sea neighs and snorts, and you breathe the
very breath that the great whales respire! Let me roll around the
globe, let me rock upon the sea; let me race and pant out my life, with
an eternal breeze astern, and an endless sea before!

But how soon these raptures abated, when after a brief idle interval,
we were again set to work, and I had a vile commission to clean out the
chicken coops, and make up the beds of the pigs in the long-boat.

Miserable dog’s life is this of the sea! commanded like a slave, and
set to work like an ass! vulgar and brutal men lording it over me, as
if I were an African in Alabama. Yes, yes, blow on, ye breezes, and
make a speedy end to this abominable voyage!




CHAPTER XIV.
HE CONTEMPLATES MAKING A SOCIAL CALL ON THE CAPTAIN IN HIS CABIN


What reminded me most forcibly of my ignominious condition, was the
widely altered manner of the captain toward me.

I had thought him a fine, funny gentleman, full of mirth and good
humor, and good will to seamen, and one who could not fail to
appreciate the difference between me and the rude sailors among whom I
was thrown. Indeed, I had made no doubt that he would in some special
manner take me under his protection, and prove a kind friend and
benefactor to me; as I had heard that some sea-captains are fathers to
their crew; and so they are; but such fathers as Solomon’s precepts
tend to make—severe and chastising fathers, fathers whose sense of duty
overcomes the sense of love, and who every day, in some sort, play the
part of Brutus, who ordered his son away to execution, as I have read
in our old family Plutarch.

Yes, I thought that Captain Riga, for Riga was his name, would be
attentive and considerate to me, and strive to cheer me up, and comfort
me in my lonesomeness. I did not even deem it at all impossible that he
would invite me down into the cabin of a pleasant night, to ask me
questions concerning my parents, and prospects in life; besides
obtaining from me some anecdotes touching my great-uncle, the
illustrious senator; or give me a slate and pencil, and teach me
problems in navigation; or perhaps engage me at a game of chess. I even
thought he might invite me to dinner on a sunny Sunday, and help me
plentifully to the nice cabin fare, as knowing how distasteful the salt
beef and pork, and hard biscuit of the forecastle must at first be to a
boy like me, who had always lived ashore, and at home.

And I could not help regarding him with peculiar emotions, almost of
tenderness and love, as the last visible link in the chain of
associations which bound me to my home. For, while yet in port, I had
seen him and Mr. Jones, my brother’s friend, standing together and
conversing; so that from the captain to my brother there was but one
intermediate step; and my brother and mother and sisters were one.

And this reminds me how often I used to pass by the places on deck,
where I remembered Mr. Jones had stood when we first visited the ship
lying at the wharf; and how I tried to convince myself that it was
indeed true, that he had stood there, though now the ship was so far
away on the wide Atlantic Ocean, and he perhaps was walking down
Wall-street, or sitting reading the newspaper in his counting room,
while poor I was so differently employed.

When two or three days had passed without the captain’s speaking to me
in any way, or sending word into the forecastle that he wished me to
drop into the cabin to pay my respects. I began to think whether I
should not make the first advances, and whether indeed he did not
expect it of me, since I was but a boy, and he a man; and perhaps that
might have been the reason why he had not spoken to me yet, deeming it
more proper and respectful for me to address him first. I thought he
might be offended, too, especially if he were a proud man, with tender
feelings. So one evening, a little before sundown, in the second
dog-watch, when there was no more work to be done, I concluded to call
and see him.

After drawing a bucket of water, and having a good washing, to get off
some of the chicken-coop stains, I went down into the forecastle to
dress myself as neatly as I could. I put on a white shirt in place of
my red one, and got into a pair of cloth trowsers instead of my duck
ones, and put on my new pumps, and then carefully brushing my
shooting-jacket, I put that on over all, so that upon the whole, I made
quite a genteel figure, at least for a forecastle, though I would not
have looked so well in a drawing-room.

When the sailors saw me thus employed, they did not know what to make
of it, and wanted to know whether I was dressing to go ashore; I told
them no, for we were then out of sight of mind; but that I was going to
pay my respects to the captain. Upon which they all laughed and
shouted, as if I were a simpleton; though there seemed nothing so very
simple in going to make an evening call upon a friend. When some of
them tried to dissuade me, saying I was green and raw; but Jackson, who
sat looking on, cried out, with a hideous grin, “Let him go, let him
go, men—he’s a nice boy. Let him go; the captain has some nuts and
raisins for him.” And so he was going on, when one of his violent fits
of coughing seized him, and he almost choked.

As I was about leaving the forecastle, I happened to look at my hands,
and seeing them stained all over of a deep yellow, for that morning the
mate had set me to tarring some strips of canvas for the rigging I
thought it would never do to present myself before a gentleman that
way; so for want of lads, I slipped on a pair of woolen mittens, which
my mother had knit for me to carry to sea. As I was putting them on,
Jackson asked me whether he shouldn’t call a carriage; and another bade
me not forget to present his best respects to the skipper. I left them
all tittering, and coming on deck was passing the cook-house, when the
old cook called after me, saying I had forgot my cane.

But I did not heed their impudence, and was walking straight toward the
cabin-door on the quarter-deck, when the chief mate met me. I touched
my hat, and was passing him, when, after staring at me till I thought
his eyes would burst out, he all at once caught me by the collar, and
with a voice of thunder, wanted to know what I meant by playing such
tricks aboard a ship that he was mate of? I told him to let go of me,
or I would complain to my friend the captain, whom I intended to visit
that evening. Upon this he gave me such a whirl round, that I thought
the Gulf Stream was in my head; and then shoved me forward, roaring out
I know not what. Meanwhile the sailors were all standing round the
windlass looking aft, mightily tickled.

Seeing I could not effect my object that night, I thought it best to
defer it for the present; and returning among the sailors, Jackson
asked me how I had found the captain, and whether the next time I went,
I would not take a friend along and introduce him.

The upshot of this business was, that before I went to sleep that
night, I felt well satisfied that it was not customary for sailors to
call on the captain in the cabin; and I began to have an inkling of the
fact, that I had acted like a fool; but it all arose from my ignorance
of sea usages.

And here I may as well state, that I never saw the inside of the cabin
during the whole interval that elapsed from our sailing till our return
to New York; though I often used to get a peep at it through a little
pane of glass, set in the house on deck, just before the helm, where a
watch was kept hanging for the helmsman to strike the half hours by,
with his little bell in the binnacle, where the compass was. And it
used to be the great amusement of the sailors to look in through the
pane of glass, when they stood at the wheel, and watch the proceedings
in the cabin; especially when the steward was setting the table for
dinner, or the captain was lounging over a decanter of wine on a little
mahogany stand, or playing the game called _solitaire,_ at cards, of an
evening; for at times he was all alone with his dignity; though, as
will ere long be shown, he generally had one pleasant companion, whose
society he did not dislike.

The day following my attempt to drop in at the cabin, I happened to be
making fast a rope on the quarter-deck, when the captain suddenly made
his appearance, promenading up and down, and smoking a cigar. He looked
very good-humored and amiable, and it being just after his dinner, I
thought that this, to be sure, was just the chance I wanted.

I waited a little while, thinking he would speak to me himself; but as
he did not, I went up to him, and began by saying it was a very
pleasant day, and hoped he was very well. I never saw a man fly into
such a rage; I thought he was going to knock me down; but after
standing speechless awhile, he all at once plucked his cap from his
head and threw it at me. I don’t know what impelled me, but I ran to
the lee-scuppers where it fell, picked it up, and gave it to him with a
bow; when the mate came running up, and thrust me forward again; and
after he had got me as far as the windlass, he wanted to know whether I
was crazy or not; for if I was, he would put me in irons right off, and
have done with it.

But I assured him I was in my right mind, and knew perfectly well that
I had been treated in the most rude and un-gentlemanly manner both by
him and Captain Riga. Upon this, he rapped out a great oath, and told
me if I ever repeated what I had done that evening, or ever again
presumed so much as to lift my hat to the captain, he would tie me into
the rigging, and keep me there until I learned better manners. “You are
very green,” said he, “but I’ll ripen you.” Indeed this chief mate
seemed to have the keeping of the dignity of the captain; who, in some
sort, seemed too dignified personally to protect his own dignity.

I thought this strange enough, to be reprimanded, and charged with
rudeness for an act of common civility. However, seeing how matters
stood, I resolved to let the captain alone for the future, particularly
as he had shown himself so deficient in the ordinary breeding of a
gentleman. And I could hardly credit it, that this was the same man who
had been so very civil, and polite, and witty, when Mr. Jones and I
called upon him in port.

But this astonishment of mine was much increased, when some days after,
a storm came upon us, and the captain rushed out of the cabin in his
nightcap, and nothing else but his shirt on; and leaping up on the
poop, began to jump up and down, and curse and swear, and call the men
aloft all manner of hard names, just like a common loafer in the
street.

Besides all this, too, I noticed that while we were at sea, he wore
nothing but old shabby clothes, very different from the glossy suit I
had seen him in at our first interview, and after that on the steps of
the City Hotel, where he always boarded when in New York. Now, he wore
nothing but old-fashioned snuff-colored coats, with high collars and
short waists; and faded, short-legged pantaloons, very tight about the
knees; and vests, that did not conceal his waistbands, owing to their
being so short, just like a little boy’s. And his hats were all caved
in, and battered, as if they had been knocked about in a cellar; and
his boots were sadly patched. Indeed, I began to think that he was but
a shabby fellow after all; particularly as his whiskers lost their
gloss, and he went days together without shaving; and his hair, by a
sort of miracle, began to grow of a pepper and salt color, which might
have been owing, though, to his discontinuing the use of some kind of
dye while at sea. I put him down as a sort of impostor; and while
ashore, a gentleman on false pretenses; for no gentleman would have
treated another gentleman as he did me.

Yes, Captain Riga, thought I, you are no gentleman, and you know it!




CHAPTER XV.
THE MELANCHOLY STATE OF HIS WARDROBE


And now that I have been speaking of the captain’s old clothes, I may
as well speak of mine.

It was very early in the month of June that we sailed; and I had
greatly rejoiced that it was that time of the year; for it would be
warm and pleasant upon the ocean, I thought; and my voyage would be
like a summer excursion to the sea shore, for the benefit of the salt
water, and a change of scene and society.

So I had not given myself much concern about what I should wear; and
deemed it wholly unnecessary to provide myself with a great outfit of
pilot-cloth jackets, and browsers, and Guernsey frocks, and oil-skin
suits, and sea-boots, and many other things, which old seamen carry in
their chests. But one reason was, that I did not have the money to buy
them with, even if I had wanted to. So in addition to the clothes I had
brought from home, I had only bought a red shirt, a tarpaulin hat, and
a belt and knife, as I have previously related, which gave me a sea
outfit, something like the Texan rangers’, whose uniform, they say,
consists of a shirt collar and a pair of spurs.

But I was not many days at sea, when I found that my shore clothing, or
_“long togs,”_ as the sailors call them, were but ill adapted to the
life I now led. When I went aloft, at my yard-arm gymnastics, my
pantaloons were all the time ripping and splitting in every direction,
particularly about the seat, owing to their not being cut
sailor-fashion, with low waistbands, and to wear without suspenders. So
that I was often placed in most unpleasant predicaments, straddling the
rigging, sometimes in plain sight of the cabin, with my table linen
exposed in the most inelegant and ungentlemanly manner possible.

And worse than all, my best pair of pantaloons, and the pair I most
prided myself upon, was a very conspicuous and remarkable looking pair.

I had had them made to order by our village tailor, a little fat man,
very thin in the legs, and who used to say he imported the latest
fashions direct from Paris; though all the fashion plates in his shop
were very dirty with fly-marks.

Well, this tailor made the pantaloons I speak of, and while he had them
in hand, I used to call and see him two or three times a day to try
them on, and hurry him forward; for he was an old man with large round
spectacles, and could not see very well, and had no one to help him but
a sick wife, with five grandchildren to take care of; and besides that,
he was such a great snuff-taker, that it interfered with his business;
for he took several pinches for every stitch, and would sit snuffing
and blowing his nose over my pantaloons, till I used to get disgusted
with him. Now, this old tailor had shown me the pattern, after which he
intended to make my pantaloons; but I improved upon it, and bade him
have a slit on the outside of each leg, at the foot, to button up with
a row of six brass bell buttons; for a grown-up cousin of mine, who was
a great sportsman, used to wear a beautiful pair of pantaloons, made
precisely in that way.

And these were the very pair I now had at sea; the sailors made a great
deal of fun of them, and were all the time calling on each other to
“twig” them; and they would ask me to lend them a button or two, by way
of a joke; and then they would ask me if I was not a soldier. Showing
very plainly that they had no idea that my pantaloons were a very
genteel pair, made in the height of the sporting fashion, and copied
from my cousin’s, who was a young man of fortune and drove a tilbury.

When my pantaloons ripped and tore, as I have said, I did my best to
mend and patch them; but not being much of a sempstress, the more I
patched the more they parted; because I put my patches on, without
heeding the joints of the legs, which only irritated my poor pants the
more, and put them out of temper.

Nor must I forget my boots, which were almost new when I left home.
They had been my Sunday boots, and fitted me to a charm. I never had
had a pair of boots that I liked better; I used to turn my toes out
when I walked in them, unless it was night time, when no one could see
me, and I had something else to think of; and I used to keep looking at
them during church; so that I lost a good deal of the sermon. In a
word, they were a beautiful pair of boots. But all this only unfitted
them the more for sea-service; as I soon discovered. They had very high
heels, which were all the time tripping me in the rigging, and several
times came near pitching me overboard; and the salt water made them
shrink in such a manner, that they pinched me terribly about the
instep; and I was obliged to gash them cruelly, which went to my very
heart. The legs were quite long, coming a good way up toward my knees,
and the edges were mounted with red morocco. The sailors used to call
them my _“gaff-topsail-boots.”_ And sometimes they used to call me
“Boots,” and sometimes “Buttons,” on account of the ornaments on my
pantaloons and shooting-jacket.

At last, I took their advice, and _“razeed”_ them, as they phrased it.
That is, I amputated the legs, and shaved off the heels to the bare
soles; which, however, did not much improve them, for it made my feet
feel flat as flounders, and besides, brought me down in the world, and
made me slip and slide about the decks, as I used to at home, when I
wore straps on the ice.

As for my tarpaulin hat, it was a very cheap one; and therefore proved
a real sham and shave; it leaked like an old shingle roof; and in a
rain storm, kept my hair wet and disagreeable. Besides, from lying down
on deck in it, during the night watches, it got bruised and battered,
and lost all its beauty; so that it was unprofitable every way.

But I had almost forgotten my shooting-jacket, which was made of
moleskin. Every day, it grew smaller and smaller, particularly after a
rain, until at last I thought it would completely exhale, and leave
nothing but the bare seams, by way of a skeleton, on my back. It became
unspeakably unpleasant, when we got into rather cold weather, crossing
the Banks of Newfoundland, when the only way I had to keep warm during
the night, was to pull on my waistcoat and my roundabout, and then clap
the shooting-jacket over all. This made it pinch me under the arms, and
it vexed, irritated, and tormented me every way; and used to incommode
my arms seriously when I was pulling the ropes; so much so, that the
mate asked me once if I had the cramp.

I may as well here glance at some trials and tribulations of a similar
kind. I had no mattress, or bed-clothes, of any sort; for the thought
of them had never entered my mind before going to sea; so that I was
obliged to sleep on the bare boards of my bunk; and when the ship
pitched violently, and almost stood upon end, I must have looked like
an Indian baby tied to a plank, and hung up against a tree like a
crucifix.

I have already mentioned my total want of table-tools; never dreaming,
that, in this respect, going to sea as a sailor was something like
going to a boarding-school, where you must furnish your own spoon and
knife, fork, and napkin. But at length, I was so happy as to barter
with a steerage passenger a silk handkerchief of mine for a half-gallon
iron pot, with hooks to it, to hang on a grate; and this pot I used to
present at the cook-house for my allowance of coffee and tea. It gave
me a good deal of trouble, though, to keep it clean, being much
disposed to rust; and the hooks sometimes scratched my face when I was
drinking; and it was unusually large and heavy; so that my breakfasts
were deprived of all ease and satisfaction, and became a toil and a
labor to me. And I was forced to use the same pot for my bean-soup,
three times a week, which imparted to it a bad flavor for coffee.

I can not tell how I really suffered in many ways for my improvidence
and heedlessness, in going to sea so ill provided with every thing
calculated to make my situation at all comfortable, or even tolerable.
In time, my wretched “long togs” began to drop off my back, and I
looked like a Sam Patch, shambling round the deck in my rags and the
wreck of my gaff-topsail-boots. I often thought what my friends at home
would have said, if they could but get one peep at me. But I hugged
myself in my miserable shooting-jacket, when I considered that that
degradation and shame never could overtake me; yet, I thought it a
galling mockery, when I remembered that my sisters had promised to tell
all inquiring friends, that Wellingborough had gone _“abroad”_ just as
if I was visiting Europe on a tour with my tutor, as poor simple Mr.
Jones had hinted to the captain.

Still, in spite of the melancholy which sometimes overtook me, there
were several little incidents that made me forget myself in the
contemplation of the strange and to me most wonderful sights of the
sea.

And perhaps nothing struck into me such a feeling of wild romance, as a
view of the first vessel we spoke. It was of a clear sunny afternoon,
and she came bearing down upon us, a most beautiful sight, with all her
sails spread wide. She came very near, and passed under our stern; and
as she leaned over to the breeze, showed her decks fore and aft; and I
saw the strange sailors grouped upon the forecastle, and the cook
looking out of his cook-house with a ladle in his hand, and the captain
in a green jacket sitting on the taffrail with a speaking-trumpet.

And here, had this vessel come out of the infinite blue ocean, with all
these human beings on board, and the smoke tranquilly mounting up into
the sea-air from the cook’s funnel as if it were a chimney in a city;
and every thing looking so cool, and calm, and of-course, in the midst
of what to me, at least, seemed a superlative marvel.

Hoisted at her mizzen-peak was a red flag, with a turreted white castle
in the middle, which looked foreign enough, and made me stare all the
harder.

Our captain, who had put on another hat and coat, and was lounging in
an elegant attitude on the poop, now put his high polished brass
trumpet to his mouth, and said in a very rude voice for conversation,
_“Where from?”_

To which the other captain rejoined with some outlandish Dutch
gibberish, of which we could only make out, that the ship belonged to
Hamburg, as her flag denoted.

_Hamburg!_

Bless my soul! and here I am on the great Atlantic Ocean, actually
beholding a ship from Holland! It was passing strange. In my intervals
of leisure from other duties, I followed the strange ship till she was
quite a little speck in the distance.

I could not but be struck with the manner of the two sea-captains
during their brief interview. Seated at their ease on their respective
“poops” toward the stern of their ships, while the sailors were obeying
their behests; they touched hats to each other, exchanged compliments,
and drove on, with all the indifference of two Arab horsemen accosting
each other on an airing in the Desert. To them, I suppose, the great
Atlantic Ocean was a puddle.




CHAPTER XVI.
AT DEAD OF NIGHT HE IS SENT UP TO LOOSE THE MAIN-SKYSAIL


I must now run back a little, and tell of my first going aloft at
middle watch, when the sea was quite calm, and the breeze was mild.

The order was given to loose the _main-skysail,_ which is the fifth and
highest sail from deck. It was a very small sail, and from the
forecastle looked no bigger than a cambric pocket-handkerchief. But I
have heard that some ships carry still smaller sails, above the
skysail; called _moon-sails,_ and _skyscrapers,_ and _cloud-rakers._
But I shall not believe in them till I see them; a _skysail_ seems high
enough in all conscience; and the idea of any thing higher than that,
seems preposterous. Besides, it looks almost like tempting heaven, to
brush the very firmament so, and almost put the eyes of the stars out;
when a flaw of wind, too, might very soon take the conceit out of these
cloud-defying _cloud-rakers._

Now, when the order was passed to loose the skysail, an old Dutch
sailor came up to me, and said, “Buttons, my boy, it’s high time you be
doing something; and it’s boy’s business, Buttons, to loose de royals,
and not old men’s business, like me. Now, d’ye see dat leelle fellow
way up dare? _dare,_ just behind dem stars dare: well, tumble up, now,
Buttons, I zay, and looze him; way you go, Buttons.”

All the rest joining in, and seeming unanimous in the opinion, that it
was high time for me to be stirring myself, and doing _boy’s business,_
as they called it, I made no more ado, but jumped into the rigging. Up
I went, not daring to look down, but keeping my eyes glued, as it were,
to the shrouds, as I ascended.

It was a long road up those stairs, and I began to pant and breathe
hard, before I was half way. But I kept at it till I got to the
_Jacob’s Ladder;_ and they may well call it so, for it took me almost
into the clouds; and at last, to my own amazement, I found myself
hanging on the skysail-yard, holding on might and main to the mast; and
curling my feet round the rigging, as if they were another pair of
hands.

For a few moments I stood awe-stricken and mute. I could not see far
out upon the ocean, owing to the darkness of the night; and from my
lofty perch, the sea looked like a great, black gulf, hemmed in, all
round, by beetling black cliffs. I seemed all alone; treading the
midnight clouds; and every second, expected to find myself
falling—falling—falling, as I have felt when the nightmare has been on
me.

I could but just perceive the ship below me, like a long narrow plank
in the water; and it did not seem to belong at all to the yard, over
which I was hanging. A gull, or some sort of sea-fowl, was flying round
the truck over my head, within a few yards of my face; and it almost
frightened me to hear it; it seemed so much like a spirit, at such a
lofty and solitary height.

Though there was a pretty smooth sea, and little wind; yet, at this
extreme elevation, the ship’s motion was very great; so that when the
ship rolled one way, I felt something as a fly must feel, walking the
ceiling; and when it rolled the other way, I felt as if I was hanging
along a slanting pine-tree.

But presently I heard a distant, hoarse noise from below; and though I
could not make out any thing intelligible, I knew it was the mate
hurrying me. So in a nervous, trembling desperation, I went to casting
off the _gaskets,_ or lines tying up the sail; and when all was ready,
sung out as I had been told, to _“hoist away!”_ And hoist they did, and
me too along with the yard and sail; for I had no time to get off, they
were so unexpectedly quick about it. It seemed like magic; there I was,
going up higher and higher; the yard rising under me, as if it were
alive, and no soul in sight. Without knowing it at the time, I was in a
good deal of danger, but it was so dark that I could not see well
enough to feel afraid—at least on that account; though I felt
frightened enough in a promiscuous way. I only held on hard, and made
good the saying of old sailors, that the last person to fall overboard
from the rigging is a landsman, because he grips the ropes so fiercely;
whereas old tars are less careful, and sometimes pay the penalty.

After this feat, I got down rapidly on deck, and received something
like a compliment from Max the Dutchman.

This man was perhaps the best natured man among the crew; at any rate,
he treated me better than the rest did; and for that reason he deserves
some mention.

Max was an old bachelor of a sailor, very precise about his wardrobe,
and prided himself greatly upon his seamanship, and entertained some
straight-laced, old-fashioned notions about the duties of boys at sea.
His hair, whiskers, and cheeks were of a fiery red; and as he wore a
red shirt, he was altogether the most combustible looking man I ever
saw.

Nor did his appearance belie him; for his temper was very inflammable;
and at a word, he would explode in a shower of hard words and
imprecations. It was Max that several times set on foot those
conspiracies against Jackson, which I have spoken of before; but he
ended by paying him a grumbling homage, full of resentful reservations.

Max sometimes manifested some little interest in my welfare; and often
discoursed concerning the sorry figure I would cut in my tatters when
we got to Liverpool, and the discredit it would bring on the American
Merchant Service; for like all European seamen in American ships, Max
prided himself not a little upon his naturalization as a Yankee, and if
he could, would have been very glad to have passed himself off for a
born native.

But notwithstanding his grief at the prospect of my reflecting
discredit upon his adopted country, he never offered to better my
wardrobe, by loaning me any thing from his own well-stored chest. Like
many other well-wishers, he contented him with sympathy. Max also
betrayed some anxiety to know whether I knew how to dance; lest, when
the ship’s company went ashore, I should disgrace them by exposing my
awkwardness in some of the sailor saloons. But I relieved his anxiety
on that head.

He was a great scold, and fault-finder, and often took me to task about
my short-comings; but herein, he was not alone; for every one had a
finger, or a thumb, and sometimes both hands, in my unfortunate pie.




CHAPTER XVII.
THE COOK AND STEWARD


It was on a Sunday we made the Banks of Newfoundland; a drizzling,
foggy, clammy Sunday. You could hardly see the water, owing to the mist
and vapor upon it; and every thing was so flat and calm, I almost
thought we must have somehow got back to New York, and were lying at
the foot of Wall-street again in a rainy twilight. The decks were
dripping with wet, so that in the dense fog, it seemed as if we were
standing on the roof of a house in a shower.

It was a most miserable Sunday; and several of the sailors had twinges
of the rheumatism, and pulled on their monkey-jackets. As for Jackson,
he was all the time rubbing his back and snarling like a dog.

I tried to recall all my pleasant, sunny Sundays ashore; and tried to
imagine what they were doing at home; and whether our old family
friend, Mr. Bridenstoke, would drop in, with his silver-mounted
tasseled cane, between churches, as he used to; and whether he would
inquire about myself.

But it would not do. I could hardly realize that it was Sunday at all.
Every thing went on pretty much the same as before. There was no church
to go to; no place to take a walk in; no friend to call upon. I began
to think it must be a sort of second Saturday; a foggy Saturday, when
school-boys stay at home reading Robinson Crusoe.

The only man who seemed to be taking his ease that day, was our black
cook; who according to the invariable custom at sea, always went by the
name of _the doctor._

And _doctors,_ cooks certainly are, the very best medicos in the world;
for what pestilent pills and potions of the Faculty are half so
serviceable to man, and health-and-strength-giving, as roasted lamb and
green peas, say, in spring; and roast beef and cranberry sauce in
winter? Will a dose of calomel and jalap do you as much good? Will a
bolus build up a fainting man? Is there any satisfaction in dining off
a powder? But these doctors of the frying-pan sometimes loll men off by
a surfeit; or give them the headache, at least. Well, what then? No
matter. For if with their most goodly and ten times jolly medicines,
they now and then fill our nights with tribulations, and abridge our
days, what of the social homicides perpetrated by the Faculty? And when
you die by a pill-doctor’s hands, it is never with a sweet relish in
your mouth, as though you died by a frying-pan-doctor; but your last
breath villainously savors of ipecac and rhubarb. Then, what charges
they make for the abominable lunches they serve out so stingily! One of
their bills for boluses would keep you in good dinners a twelve-month.

Now, our doctor was a serious old fellow, much given to metaphysics,
and used to talk about original sin. All that Sunday morning, he sat
over his boiling pots, reading out of a book which was very much soiled
and covered with grease spots: for he kept it stuck into a little
leather strap, nailed to the keg where he kept the fat skimmed off the
water in which the salt beef was cooked. I could hardly believe my eyes
when I found this book was the Bible.

I loved to peep in upon him, when he was thus absorbed; for his smoky
studio or study was a strange-looking place enough; not more than five
feet square, and about as many high; a mere box to hold the stove, the
pipe of which stuck out of the roof.

Within, it was hung round with pots and pans; and on one side was a
little looking-glass, where he used to shave; and on a small shelf were
his shaving tools, and a comb and brush. Fronting the stove, and very
close to it, was a sort of narrow shelf, where he used to sit with his
legs spread out very wide, to keep them from scorching; and there, with
his book in one hand, and a pewter spoon in the other, he sat all that
Sunday morning, stirring up his pots, and studying away at the same
time; seldom taking his eye off the page. Reading must have been very
hard work for him; for he muttered to himself quite loud as he read;
and big drops of sweat would stand upon his brow, and roll off, till
they hissed on the hot stove before him. But on the day I speak of, it
was no wonder that he got perplexed, for he was reading a mysterious
passage in the Book of Chronicles. Being aware that I knew how to read,
he called me as I was passing his premises, and read the passage over,
demanding an explanation. I told him it was a mystery that no one could
explain; not even a parson. But this did not satisfy him, and I left
him poring over it still.

He must have been a member of one of those negro churches, which are to
be found in New York. For when we lay at the wharf, I remembered that a
committee of three reverend looking old darkies, who, besides their
natural canonicals, wore quaker-cut black coats, and broad-brimmed
black hats, and white neck-cloths; these colored gentlemen called upon
him, and remained conversing with him at his cookhouse door for more
than an hour; and before they went away they stepped inside, and the
sliding doors were closed; and then we heard some one reading aloud and
preaching; and after that a psalm was sung and a benediction given;
when the door opened again, and the congregation came out in a great
perspiration; owing, I suppose, to the chapel being so small, and there
being only one seat besides the stove.

But notwithstanding his religious studies and meditations, this old
fellow used to use some bad language occasionally; particularly of
cold, wet stormy mornings, when he had to get up before daylight and
make his fire; with the sea breaking over the bows, and now and then
dashing into his stove.

So, under the circumstances, you could not blame him much, if he did
rip a little, for it would have tried old Job’s temper, to be set to
work making a fire in the water.

Without being at all neat about his premises, this old cook was very
particular about them; he had a warm love and affection for his
cook-house. In fair weather, he spread the skirt of an old jacket
before the door, by way of a mat; and screwed a small ring-bolt into
the door for a knocker; and wrote his name, “Mr. Thompson,” over it,
with a bit of red chalk.

The men said he lived round the corner of _Forecastle-square,_ opposite
the _Liberty Pole;_ because his cook-house was right behind the
foremast, and very near the quarters occupied by themselves.

Sailors have a great fancy for naming things that way on shipboard.
When a man is hung at sea, which is always done from one of the lower
yard-arms, they say he _“takes a walk up Ladder-lane, and down
Hemp-street.”_

Mr. Thompson was a great crony of the steward’s, who, being a handsome,
dandy mulatto, that had once been a barber in West-Broadway, went by
the name of Lavender. I have mentioned the gorgeous turban he wore when
Mr. Jones and I visited the captain in the cabin. He never wore that
turban at sea, though; but sported an uncommon head of frizzled hair,
just like the large, round brush, used for washing windows, called a
_Pope’s Head._

He kept it well perfumed with Cologne water, of which he had a large
supply, the relics of his West-Broadway stock in trade. His clothes,
being mostly cast-off suits of the captain of a London liner, whom he
had sailed with upon many previous voyages, were all in the height of
the exploded fashions, and of every kind of color and cut. He had
claret-colored suits, and snuff-colored suits, and red velvet vests,
and buff and brimstone pantaloons, and several full suits of black,
which, with his dark-colored face, made him look quite clerical; like a
serious young colored gentleman of Barbados, about to take orders.

He wore an uncommon large pursy ring on his forefinger, with something
he called a real diamond in it; though it was very dim, and looked more
like a glass eye than any thing else. He was very proud of his ring,
and was always calling your attention to something, and pointing at it
with his ornamented finger.

He was a sentimental sort of a darky, and read the _“Three Spaniards,”_
and _“Charlotte Temple,”_ and carried a lock of frizzled hair in his
vest pocket, which he frequently volunteered to show to people, with
his handkerchief to his eyes. Every fine evening, about sunset, these
two, the cook and steward, used to sit on the little shelf in the
cook-house, leaning up against each other like the Siamese twins, to
keep from falling off, for the shelf was very short; and there they
would stay till after dark, smoking their pipes, and gossiping about
the events that had happened during the day in the cabin.

And sometimes Mr. Thompson would take down his Bible, and read a
chapter for the edification of Lavender, whom he knew to be a sad
profligate and gay deceiver ashore; addicted to every youthful
indiscretion. He would read over to him the story of Joseph and
Potiphar’s wife; and hold Joseph up to him as a young man of excellent
principles, whom he ought to imitate, and not be guilty of his
indiscretion any more. And Lavender would look serious, and say that he
knew it was all true—he was a wicked youth, he knew it—he had broken a
good many hearts, and many eyes were weeping for him even then, both in
New York, and Liverpool, and London, and Havre. But how could he help
it? He hadn’t made his handsome face, and fine head of hair, and
graceful figure. It was not _he,_ but the others, that were to blame;
for his bewitching person turned all heads and subdued all hearts,
wherever he went. And then he would look very serious and penitent, and
go up to the little glass, and pass his hands through his hair, and see
how his whiskers were coming on.




CHAPTER XVIII.
HE ENDEAVORS TO IMPROVE HIS MIND; AND TELLS OF ONE BLUNT AND HIS DREAM
BOOK


On the Sunday afternoon I spoke of, it was my watch below, and I
thought I would spend it profitably, in improving my mind.

My bunk was an upper one; and right over the head of it was a
_bull’s-eye,_ or circular piece of thick ground glass, inserted into
the deck to give light. It was a dull, dubious light, though; and I
often found myself looking up anxiously to see whether the bull’s-eye
had not suddenly been put out; for whenever any one trod on it, in
walking the deck, it was momentarily quenched; and what was still
worse, sometimes a coil of rope would be thrown down on it, and stay
there till I dressed myself and went up to remove it—a kind of
interruption to my studies which annoyed me very much, when diligently
occupied in reading.

However, I was glad of any light at all, down in that gloomy hole,
where we burrowed like rabbits in a warren; and it was the happiest
time I had, when all my messmates were asleep, and I could lie on my
back, during a forenoon watch below, and read in comparative quiet and
seclusion.

I had already read two books loaned to me by Max, to whose share they
had fallen, in dividing the effects of the sailor who had jumped
overboard. One was an account of Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea, and
the other was a large black volume, with _Delirium Tremens_ in great
gilt letters on the back. This proved to be a popular treatise on the
subject of that disease; and I remembered seeing several copies in the
sailor book-stalls about Fulton Market, and along South-street, in New
York.

But this Sunday I got out a book, from which I expected to reap great
profit and sound instruction. It had been presented to me by Mr. Jones,
who had quite a library, and took down this book from a top shelf,
where it lay very dusty. When he gave it to me, he said, that although
I was going to sea, I must not forget the importance of a good
education; and that there was hardly any situation in life, however
humble and depressed, or dark and gloomy, but one might find leisure in
it to store his mind, and build himself up in the exact sciences. And
he added, that though it _did_ look rather unfavorable for my future
prospects, to be going to sea as a common sailor so early in life; yet,
it would no doubt turn out for my benefit in the end; and, at any rate,
if I would only take good care of myself, would give me a sound
constitution, if nothing more; and _that_ was not to be undervalued,
for how many very rich men would give all their bonds and mortgages for
my boyish robustness.

He added, that I need not expect any light, trivial work, that was
merely entertaining, and nothing more; but here I would find
entertainment and edification beautifully and harmoniously combined;
and though, at first, I might possibly find it dull, yet, if I perused
the book thoroughly, it would soon discover hidden charms and
unforeseen attractions; besides teaching me, perhaps, the true way to
retrieve the poverty of my family, and again make them all well-to-do
in the world.

Saying this, he handed it to me, and I blew the dust off, and looked at
the back: _“Smith’s Wealth of Nations.”_ This not satisfying me, I
glanced at the title page, and found it was an _“Enquiry into the
Nature and Causes”_ of the alleged wealth of nations. But happening to
look further down, I caught sight of _“Aberdeen,”_ where the book was
printed; and thinking that any thing from Scotland, a foreign country,
must prove some way or other pleasing to me, I thanked Mr. Jones very
kindly, and promised to peruse the volume carefully.

So, now, lying in my bunk, I began the book methodically, at page
number one, resolved not to permit a few flying glimpses into it, taken
previously, to prevent me from making regular approaches to the gist
and body of the book, where I fancied lay something like the
philosopher’s stone, a secret talisman, which would transmute even
pitch and tar to silver and gold.

Pleasant, though vague visions of future opulence floated before me, as
I commenced the first chapter, entitled _“Of the causes of improvement
in the productive power of labor.”_ Dry as crackers and cheese, to be
sure; and the chapter itself was not much better. But this was only
getting initiated; and if I read on, the grand secret would be opened
to me. So I read on and on, about _“wages and profits of labor,”_
without getting any profits myself for my pains in perusing it.

Dryer and dryer; the very leaves smelt of saw-dust; till at last I
drank some water, and went at it again. But soon I had to give it up
for lost work; and thought that the old backgammon board, we had at
home, lettered on the back, _“The History of Rome”_ was quite as full
of matter, and a great deal more entertaining. I wondered whether Mr.
Jones had ever read the volume himself; and could not help remembering,
that he had to get on a chair when he reached it down from its dusty
shelf; _that_ certainly looked suspicious.

The best reading was on the fly leaves; and, on turning them over, I
lighted upon some half effaced pencil-marks to the following effect:
_“Jonathan Jones, from his particular friend Daniel Dods,_ 1798.” So it
must have originally belonged to Mr. Jones’ father; and I wondered
whether _he_ had ever read it; or, indeed, whether any body had ever
read it, even the author himself; but then authors, they say, never
read their own books; writing them, being enough in all conscience.

At length I fell asleep, with the volume in my hand; and never slept so
sound before; after that, I used to wrap my jacket round it, and use it
for a pillow; for which purpose it answered very well; only I sometimes
waked up feeling dull and stupid; but of course the book could not have
been the cause of that.

And now I am talking of books, I must tell of Jack Blunt the sailor,
and his Dream Book.

Jackson, who seemed to know every thing about all parts of the world,
used to tell Jack in reproach, that he was an _Irish Cockney._ By which
I understood, that he was an Irishman born, but had graduated in
London, somewhere about Radcliffe Highway; but he had no sort of brogue
that I could hear.

He was a curious looking fellow, about twenty-five years old, as I
should judge; but to look at his back, you would have taken him for a
little old man. His arms and legs were very large, round, short, and
stumpy; so that when he had on his great monkey-jacket, and sou’west
cap flapping in his face, and his sea boots drawn up to his knees, he
looked like a fat porpoise, standing on end. He had a round face, too,
like a walrus; and with about the same expression, half human and half
indescribable. He was, upon the whole, a good-natured fellow, and a
little given to looking at sea-life romantically; singing songs about
susceptible mermaids who fell in love with handsome young oyster boys
and gallant fishermen. And he had a sad story about a man-of-war’s-man
who broke his heart at Portsmouth during the late war, and threw away
his life recklessly at one of the quarter-deck cannonades, in the
battle between the Guerriere and Constitution; and another
incomprehensible story about a sort of fairy sea-queen, who used to be
dunning a sea-captain all the time for his autograph to boil in some
eel soup, for a spell against the scurvy.

He believed in all kinds of witch-work and magic; and had some wild
Irish words he used to mutter over during a calm for a fair wind.

And he frequently related his interviews in Liverpool with a
fortune-teller, an old negro woman by the name of De Squak, whose house
was much frequented by sailors; and how she had two black cats, with
remarkably green eyes, and nightcaps on their heads, solemnly seated on
a claw-footed table near the old goblin; when she felt his pulse, to
tell what was going to befall him.

This Blunt had a large head of hair, very thick and bushy; but from
some cause or other, it was rapidly turning gray; and in its transition
state made him look as if he wore a shako of badger skin.

The phenomenon of gray hairs on a young head, had perplexed and
confounded this Blunt to such a degree that he at last came to the
conclusion it must be the result of the black art, wrought upon him by
an enemy; and that enemy, he opined, was an old sailor landlord in
Marseilles, whom he had once seriously offended, by knocking him down
in a fray.

So while in New York, finding his hair growing grayer and grayer, and
all his friends, the ladies and others, laughing at him, and calling
him an old man with one foot in the grave, he slipt out one night to an
apothecary’s, stated his case, and wanted to know what could be done
for him.

The apothecary immediately gave him a pint bottle of something he
called _“Trafalgar Oil_ for restoring the hair,” _price one dollar;_
and told him that after he had used that bottle, and it did not have
the desired effect, he must try bottle No. 2, called _“Balm of
Paradise, or the Elixir of the Battle of Copenhagen.”_ These
high-sounding naval names delighted Blunt, and he had no doubt there
must be virtue in them.

I saw both bottles; and on one of them was an engraving, representing a
young man, presumed to be gray-headed, standing in his night-dress in
the middle of his chamber, and with closed eyes applying the Elixir to
his head, with both hands; while on the bed adjacent stood a large
bottle, conspicuously labeled, _“Balm of Paradise.”_ It seemed from the
text, that this gray-headed young man was so smitten with his hair-oil,
and was so thoroughly persuaded of its virtues, that he had got out of
bed, even in his sleep; groped into his closet, seized the precious
bottle, applied its contents, and then to bed again, getting up in the
morning without knowing any thing about it. Which, indeed, was a most
mysterious occurrence; and it was still more mysterious, how the
engraver came to know an event, of which the actor himself was
ignorant, and where there were no bystanders.

Three times in the twenty-four hours, Blunt, while at sea, regularly
rubbed in his liniments; but though the first bottle was soon exhausted
by his copious applications, and the second half gone, he still stuck
to it, that by the time we got to Liverpool, his exertions would be
crowned with success. And he was not a little delighted, that this
gradual change would be operating while we were at sea; so as not to
expose him to the invidious observations of people ashore; on the same
principle that dandies go into the country when they purpose raising
whiskers. He would often ask his shipmates, whether they noticed any
change yet; and if so, how much of a change? And to tell the truth,
there was a very great change indeed; for the constant soaking of his
hair with oil, operating in conjunction with the neglect of his toilet,
and want of a brush and comb, had matted his locks together like a wild
horse’s mane, and imparted to it a blackish and extremely glossy hue.
Besides his collection of hair-oils, Blunt had also provided himself
with several boxes of pills, which he had purchased from a sailor
doctor in New York, who by placards stuck on the posts along the
wharves, advertised to remain standing at the northeast corner of
Catharine Market, every Monday and Friday, between the hours of ten and
twelve in the morning, to receive calls from patients, distribute
medicines, and give advice gratis.

Whether Blunt thought he had the dyspepsia or not, I can not say; but
at breakfast, he always took three pills with his coffee; something as
they do in Iowa, when the bilious fever prevails; where, at the
boarding-houses, they put a vial of blue pills into the castor, along
with the pepper and mustard, and next door to another vial of
toothpicks. But they are very ill-bred and unpolished in the western
country.

Several times, too, Blunt treated himself to a flowing bumper of _horse
salts_ (Glauber salts); for like many other seamen, he never went to
sea without a good supply of that luxury. He would frequently, also,
take this medicine in a wet jacket, and then go on deck into a rain
storm. But this is nothing to other sailors, who at sea will doctor
themselves with calomel off Cape Horn, and still remain on duty. And in
this connection, some really frightful stories might be told; but I
forbear.

For a landsman to take salts as this Blunt did, it would perhaps be the
death of him; but at sea the salt air and the salt water prevent you
from catching cold so readily as on land; and for my own part, on board
this very ship, being so illy-provided with clothes, I frequently
turned into my bunk soaking wet, and turned out again piping hot, and
smoking like a roasted sirloin; and yet was never the worse for it; for
then, I bore a charmed life of youth and health, and was dagger-proof
to bodily ill.

But it is time to tell of the Dream Book. Snugly hidden in one corner
of his chest, Blunt had an extraordinary looking pamphlet, with a red
cover, marked all over with astrological signs and ciphers, and
purporting to be a full and complete treatise on the art of Divination;
so that the most simple sailor could teach it to himself.

It also purported to be the selfsame system, by aid of which Napoleon
Bonaparte had risen in the world from being a corporal to an emperor.
Hence it was entitled the _Bonaparte Dream Book;_ for the magic of it
lay in the interpretation of dreams, and their application to the
foreseeing of future events; so that all preparatory measures might be
taken beforehand; which would be exceedingly convenient, and
satisfactory every way, if true. The problems were to be cast by means
of figures, in some perplexed and difficult way, which, however, was
facilitated by a set of tables in the end of the pamphlet, something
like the Logarithm Tables at the end of Bowditch’s Navigator.

Now, Blunt revered, adored, and worshiped this _Bonaparte Dream Book_
of his; and was fully persuaded that between those red covers, and in
his own dreams, lay all the secrets of futurity. Every morning before
taking his pills, and applying his hair-oils, he would steal out of his
bunk before the rest of the watch were awake; take out his pamphlet,
and a bit of chalk; and then straddling his chest, begin scratching his
oily head to remember his fugitive dreams; marking down strokes on his
chest-lid, as if he were casting up his daily accounts.

Though often perplexed and lost in mazes concerning the cabalistic
figures in the book, and the chapter of directions to beginners; for he
could with difficulty read at all; yet, in the end, if not interrupted,
he somehow managed to arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to him. So
that, as he generally wore a good-humored expression, no doubt he must
have thought, that all his future affairs were working together for the
best.

But one night he started us all up in a fright, by springing from his
bunk, his eyes ready to start out of his head, and crying, in a husky
voice—“Boys! boys! get the benches ready! Quick, quick!”

“What benches?” growled Max—“What’s the matter?”

“Benches! benches!” screamed Blunt, without heeding him, “cut down the
forests, bear a hand, boys; the Day of Judgment’s coming!”

But the next moment, he got quietly into his bunk, and laid still,
muttering to himself, he had only been rambling in his sleep.

I did not know exactly what he had meant by his _benches;_ till,
shortly after, I overheard two of the sailors debating, whether mankind
would stand or sit at the Last Day.




CHAPTER XIX.
A NARROW ESCAPE


This Dream Book of Blunt’s reminds me of a narrow escape we had, early
one morning.

It was the larboard watch’s turn to remain below from midnight till
four o’clock; and having turned in and slept, Blunt suddenly turned out
again about three o’clock, with a wonderful dream in his head; which he
was desirous of at once having interpreted.

So he goes to his chest, gets out his tools, and falls to ciphering on
the lid. When, all at once, a terrible cry was heard, that routed him
and all the rest of us up, and sent the whole ship’s company flying on
deck in the dark. We did not know what it was; but somehow, among
sailors at sea, they seem to know when real danger of any land is at
hand, even in their sleep.

When we got on deck, we saw the mate standing on the bowsprit, and
crying out _Luff! Luff!_ to some one in the dark water before the ship.
In that direction, we could just see a light, and then, the great black
hull of a strange vessel, that was coming down on us obliquely; and so
near, that we heard the flap of her topsails as they shook in the wind,
the trampling of feet on the deck, and the same cry of _Luff! Luff!_
that our own mate, was raising.

In a minute more, I caught my breath, as I heard a snap and a crash,
like the fall of a tree, and suddenly, one of our flying-jib guys
jerked out the bolt near the cat-head; and presently, we heard our
jib-boom thumping against our bows.

Meantime, the strange ship, scraping by us thus, shot off into the
darkness, and we saw her no more. But she, also, must have been
injured; for when it grew light, we found pieces of strange rigging
mixed with ours. We repaired the damage, and replaced the broken spar
with another jib-boom we had; for all ships carry spare spars against
emergencies.

The cause of this accident, which came near being the death of all on
board, was nothing but the drowsiness of the look-out men on the
forecastles of both ships. The sailor who had the look-out on our
vessel was terribly reprimanded by the mate.

No doubt, many ships that are never heard of after leaving port, meet
their fate in this way; and it may be, that sometimes two vessels
coming together, jib-boom-and-jib-boom, with a sudden shock in the
middle watch of the night, mutually destroy each other; and like
fighting elks, sink down into the ocean, with their antlers locked in
death.

While I was at Liverpool, a fine ship that lay near us in the docks,
having got her cargo on board, went to sea, bound for India, with a
good breeze; and all her crew felt sure of a prosperous voyage. But in
about seven days after, she came back, a most distressing object to
behold. All her starboard side was torn and splintered; her starboard
anchor was gone; and a great part of the starboard bulwarks; while
every one of the lower yard-arms had been broken, in the same
direction; so that she now carried small and unsightly _jury-yards._

When I looked at this vessel, with the whole of one side thus
shattered, but the other still in fine trim; and when I remembered her
gay and gallant appearance, when she left the same harbor into which
she now entered so forlorn; I could not help thinking of a young man I
had known at home, who had left his cottage one morning in high
spirits, and was brought back at noon with his right side paralyzed
from head to foot.

It seems that this vessel had been run against by a strange ship,
crowding all sail before a fresh breeze; and the stranger had rushed
past her starboard side, reducing her to the sad state in which she now
was.

Sailors can not be too wakeful and cautious, when keeping their night
look-outs; though, as I well know, they too often suffer themselves to
become negligent, and nod. And this is not so wonderful, after all; for
though every seaman has heard of those accidents at sea; and many of
them, perhaps, have been in ships that have suffered from them; yet,
when you find yourself sailing along on the ocean at night, without
having seen a sail for weeks and weeks, it is hard for you to realize
that any are near. Then, if they _are_ near, it seems almost incredible
that on the broad, boundless sea, which washes Greenland at one end of
the world, and the Falkland Islands at the other, that any one vessel
upon such a vast highway, should come into close contact with another.
But the likelihood of great calamities occurring, seldom obtrudes upon
the minds of ignorant men, such as sailors generally are; for the
things which wise people know, anticipate, and guard against, the
ignorant can only become acquainted with, by meeting them face to face.
And even when experience has taught them, the lesson only serves for
that day; inasmuch as the foolish in prosperity are infidels to the
possibility of adversity; they see the sun in heaven, and believe it to
be far too bright ever to set. And even, as suddenly as the bravest and
fleetest ships, while careering in pride of canvas over the sea, have
been struck, as by lightning, and quenched out of sight; even so, do
some lordly men, with all their plans and prospects gallantly trimmed
to the fair, rushing breeze of life, and with no thought of death and
disaster, suddenly encounter a shock unforeseen, and go down,
foundering, into death.




CHAPTER XX.
IN A FOG HE IS SET TO WORK AS A BELL-TOLLER, AND BEHOLDS A HERD OF
OCEAN-ELEPHANTS


What is this that we sail through? What palpable obscure? What smoke
and reek, as if the whole steaming world were revolving on its axis, as
a spit?

It is a Newfoundland Fog; and we are yet crossing the Grand Banks,
wrapt in a mist, that no London in the Novemberest November ever
equaled. The chronometer pronounced it noon; but do you call this
midnight or midday? So dense is the fog, that though we have a fair
wind, we shorten sail for fear of accidents; and not only that, but
here am I, poor Wellingborough, mounted aloft on a sort of belfry, the
top of the _“Sampson-Post,”_ a lofty tower of timber, so called; and
tolling the ship’s bell, as if for a funeral.

This is intended to proclaim our approach, and warn all strangers from
our track.

Dreary sound! toll, toll, toll, through the dismal mist and fog.

The bell is green with verdigris, and damp with dew; and the little
cord attached to the clapper, by which I toll it, now and then slides
through my fingers, slippery with wet. Here I am, in my slouched black
hat, like the _“bull that could pull,”_ announcing the decease of the
lamented Cock-Robin.

A better device than the bell, however, was once pitched upon by an
ingenious sea-captain, of whom I have heard. He had a litter of young
porkers on board; and while sailing through the fog, he stationed men
at both ends of the pen with long poles, wherewith they incessantly
stirred up and irritated the porkers, who split the air with their
squeals; and no doubt saved the ship, as the geese saved the Capitol.

The most strange and unheard-of noises came out of the fog at times: a
vast sound of sighing and sobbing. What could it be? This would be
followed by a spout, and a gush, and a cascading commotion, as if some
fountain had suddenly jetted out of the ocean.

Seated on my Sampson-Post, I stared more and more, and suspended my
duty as a sexton. But presently some one cried out—_“There she blows!
whales! whales close alongside!”_

A whale! Think of it! whales close to _me,_ Wellingborough;— would my
own brother believe it? I dropt the clapper as if it were red-hot, and
rushed to the side; and there, dimly floating, lay four or five long,
black snaky-looking shapes, only a few inches out of the water.

Can these be whales? Monstrous whales, such as I had heard of? I
thought they would look like mountains on the sea; hills and valleys of
flesh! regular krakens, that made it high tide, and inundated
continents, when they descended to feed!

It was a bitter disappointment, from which I was long in recovering. I
lost all respect for whales; and began to be a little dubious about the
story of Jonah; for how could Jonah reside in such an insignificant
tenement; how could he have had elbow-room there? But perhaps, thought
I, the whale which according to Rabbinical traditions was a female one,
might have expanded to receive him like an anaconda, when it swallows
an elk and leaves the antlers sticking out of its mouth.

Nevertheless, from that day, whales greatly fell in my estimation.

But it is always thus. If you read of St. Peter’s, they say, and then
go and visit it, ten to one, you account it a dwarf compared to your
high-raised ideal. And, doubtless, Jonah himself must have been
disappointed when he looked up to the domed midriff surmounting the
whale’s belly, and surveyed the ribbed pillars around him. A pretty
large belly, to be sure, thought he, but not so big as it might have
been.

On the next day, the fog lifted; and by noon, we found ourselves
sailing through fleets of fishermen at anchor. They were very small
craft; and when I beheld them, I perceived the force of that sailor
saying, intended to illustrate restricted quarters, or being _on the
limits. It is like a fisherman’s walk,_ say they, _three steps and
overboard._

Lying right in the track of the multitudinous ships crossing the ocean
between England and America, these little vessels are sometimes run
down, and obliterated from the face of the waters; the cry of the
sailors ceasing with the last whirl of the whirlpool that closes over
their craft. Their sad fate is frequently the result of their own
remissness in keeping a good look-out by day, and not having their
lamps trimmed, like the wise virgins, by night.

As I shall not make mention of the Grand Banks on our homeward-bound
passage, I may as well here relate, that on our return, we approached
them in the night; and by way of making sure of our whereabouts, the
deep-sea-lead was heaved. The line attached is generally upward of
three hundred fathoms in length; and the lead itself, weighing some
forty or fifty pounds, has a hole in the lower end, in which, previous
to sounding, some tallow is thrust, that it may bring up the soil at
the bottom, for the captain to inspect. This is called “arming” the
lead.

We “hove” our deep-sea-line by night, and the operation was very
interesting, at least to me. In the first place, the vessel’s heading
was stopt; then, coiled away in a tub, like a whale-rope, the line was
placed toward the after part of the quarter-deck; and one of the
sailors carried the lead outside of the ship, away along to the end of
the jib-boom, and at the word of command, far ahead and overboard it
went, with a plunge; scraping by the side, till it came to the stern,
when the line ran out of the tub like light.

When we came to haul _it_ up, I was astonished at the force necessary
to perform the work. The whole watch pulled at the line, which was rove
through a block in the mizzen-rigging, as if we were hauling up a fat
porpoise. When the lead came in sight, I was all eagerness to examine
the tallow, and get a peep at a specimen of the bottom of the sea; but
the sailors did not seem to be much interested by it, calling me a fool
for wanting to preserve a few grains of the sand.

I had almost forgotten to make mention of the Gulf Stream, in which we
found ourselves previous to crossing the Banks. The fact of our being
in it was proved by the captain in person, who superintended the
drawing of a bucket of salt water, in which he dipped his thermometer.
In the absence of the Gulf-weed, this is the general test; for the
temperature of this current is eight degrees higher than that of the
ocean, and the temperature of the ocean is twenty degrees higher than
that of the Grand Banks. And it is to this remarkable difference of
temperature, for which there can be no equilibrium, that many seamen
impute the fogs on the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland; but why
there should always be such ugly weather in the Gulf, is something that
I do not know has ever been accounted for.

It is curious to dip one’s finger in a bucket full of the Gulf Stream,
and find it so warm; as if the Gulf of Mexico, from whence this current
comes, were a great caldron or boiler, on purpose to keep warm the
North Atlantic, which is traversed by it for a distance of two thousand
miles, as some large halls in winter are by hot air tubes. Its mean
breadth being about two hundred leagues, it comprises an area larger
than that of the whole Mediterranean, and may be deemed a sort of
Mississippi of hot water flowing through the ocean; off the coast of
Florida, running at the rate of one mile and a half an hour.




CHAPTER XXI.
A WHALEMAN AND A MAN-OF-WAR’S-MAN


The sight of the whales mentioned in the preceding chapter was the
bringing out of Larry, one of our crew, who hitherto had been quite
silent and reserved, as if from some conscious inferiority, though he
had shipped as an _ordinary seaman,_ and, for aught I could see,
performed his duty very well.

When the men fell into a dispute concerning what kind of whales they
were which we saw, Larry stood by attentively, and after garnering in
their ignorance, all at once broke out, and astonished every body by
his intimate acquaintance with the monsters.

“They ar’n’t sperm whales,” said Larry, “their spouts ar’n’t bushy
enough; they ar’n’t Sulphur-bottoms, or they wouldn’t stay up so long;
they ar’n’t Hump-backs, for they ar’n’t got any humps; they ar’n’t
Fin-backs, for you won’t catch a Finback so near a ship; they ar’n’t
Greenland whales, for we ar’n’t off the coast of Greenland; and they
ar’n’t right whales, for it wouldn’t be right to say so. I tell ye,
men, them’s Crinkum-crankum whales.”

“And what are them?” said a sailor.

“Why, them is whales that can’t be cotched.”

Now, as it turned out that this Larry had been bred to the sea in a
whaler, and had sailed out of Nantucket many times; no one but Jackson
ventured to dispute his opinion; and even Jackson did not press him
very hard. And ever after, Larry’s judgment was relied upon concerning
all strange fish that happened to float by us during the voyage; for
whalemen are far more familiar with the wonders of the deep than any
other class of seaman.

This was Larry’s first voyage in the merchant service, and that was the
reason why, hitherto, he had been so reserved; since he well knew that
merchant seamen generally affect a certain superiority to
_“blubber-boilers,”_ as they contemptuously style those who hunt the
leviathan. But Larry turned out to be such an inoffensive fellow, and
so well understood his business aboard ship, and was so ready to jump
to an order, that he was exempted from the taunts which he might
otherwise have encountered.

He was a somewhat singular man, who wore his hat slanting forward over
the bridge of his nose, with his eyes cast down, and seemed always
examining your boots, when speaking to you. I loved to hear him talk
about the wild places in the Indian Ocean, and on the coast of
Madagascar, where he had frequently touched during his whaling voyages.
And this familiarity with the life of nature led by the people in that
remote part of the world, had furnished Larry with a sentimental
distaste for civilized society. When opportunity offered, he never
omitted extolling the delights of the free and easy Indian Ocean.

“Why,” said Larry, talking through his nose, as usual, “in _Madagasky_
there, they don’t wear any togs at all, nothing but a bowline round the
midships; they don’t have no dinners, but keeps a dinin’ all day off
fat pigs and dogs; they don’t go to bed any where, but keeps a noddin’
all the time; and they gets drunk, too, from some first rate arrack
they make from cocoa-nuts; and smokes plenty of ’baccy, too, I tell ye.
Fine country, that! Blast Ameriky, I say!”

To tell the truth, this Larry dealt in some illiberal insinuations
against civilization.

“And what’s the use of bein’ _snivelized!”_ said he to me one night
during our watch on deck; “snivelized chaps only learns the way to take
on ’bout life, and snivel. You don’t see any Methodist chaps feelin’
dreadful about their souls; you don’t see any darned beggars and pesky
constables in _Madagasky, I_ tell ye; and none o’ them kings there gets
their big toes pinched by the gout. Blast Ameriky, I say.”

Indeed, this Larry was rather cutting in his innuendoes.

“Are _you_ now, Buttons, any better off for bein’ snivelized?” coming
close up to me and eying the wreck of my gaff-topsail-boots very
steadfastly. “No; you ar’n’t a bit—but you’re a good deal _worse_ for
it, Buttons. I tell ye, ye wouldn’t have been to sea here, leadin’ this
dog’s life, if you hadn’t been snivelized—that’s the cause why, now.
Snivelization has been the ruin on ye; and it’s spiled me complete; I
might have been a great man in Madagasky; it’s too darned bad! Blast
Ameriky, I say.” And in bitter grief at the social blight upon his
whole past, present, and future, Larry turned away, pulling his hat
still lower down over the bridge of his nose.

In strong contrast to Larry, was a young man-of-war’s man we had, who
went by the name of _“Gun-Deck,”_ from his always talking of sailor
life in the navy. He was a little fellow with a small face and a
prodigious mop of brown hair; who always dressed in man-of-war style,
with a wide, braided collar to his frock, and Turkish trowsers. But he
particularly prided himself upon his feet, which were quite small; and
when we washed down decks of a morning, never mind how chilly it might
be, he always took off his boots, and went paddling about like a duck,
turning out his pretty toes to show his charming feet.

He had served in the armed steamers during the Seminole War in Florida,
and had a good deal to say about sailing up the rivers there, through
the everglades, and popping off Indians on the banks. I remember his
telling a story about a party being discovered at quite a distance from
them; but one of the savages was made very conspicuous by a pewter
plate, which he wore round his neck, and which glittered in the sun.
This plate proved his death; for, according to _Gun-Deck,_ he himself
shot it through the middle, and the ball entered the wearer’s heart. It
was a rat-killing war, he said.

_Gun-Deck_ had touched at Cadiz: had been to Gibraltar; and ashore at
Marseilles. He had sunned himself in the Bay of Naples: eaten figs and
oranges in Messina; and cheerfully lost one of his hearts at Malta,
among the ladies there. And about all these things, he talked like a
romantic man-of-war’s man, who had seen the civilized world, and loved
it; found it good, and a comfortable place to live in. So he and Larry
never could agree in their respective views of civilization, and of
savagery, of the Mediterranean and _Madagasky._




CHAPTER XXII.
THE HIGHLANDER PASSES A WRECK


We were still on the Banks, when a terrific storm came down upon us,
the like of which I had never before beheld, or imagined. The rain
poured down in sheets and cascades; the scupper holes could hardly
carry it off the decks; and in bracing the yards we waded about almost
up to our knees; every thing floating about, like chips in a dock.

This violent rain was the precursor of a hard squall, for which we duly
prepared, taking in our canvas to double-reefed-top-sails.

The tornado came rushing along at last, like a troop of wild horses
before the flaming rush of a burning prairie. But after bowing and
cringing to it awhile, the good Highlander was put off before it; and
with her nose in the water, went wallowing on, ploughing milk-white
waves, and leaving a streak of illuminated foam in her wake.

It was an awful scene. It made me catch my breath as I gazed. I could
hardly stand on my feet, so violent was the motion of the ship. But
while I reeled to and fro, the sailors only laughed at me; and bade me
look out that the ship did not fall overboard; and advised me to get a
handspike, and hold it down hard in the weather-scuppers, to steady her
wild motions. But I was now getting a little too wise for this foolish
kind of talk; though all through the voyage, they never gave it over.

This storm past, we had fair weather until we got into the Irish Sea.

The morning following the storm, when the sea and sky had become blue
again, the man aloft sung out that there was a wreck on the lee-beam.
We bore away for it, all hands looking eagerly toward it, and the
captain in the mizzen-top with his spy-glass. Presently, we slowly
passed alongside of it.

It was a dismantled, water-logged schooner, a most dismal sight, that
must have been drifting about for several long weeks. The bulwarks were
pretty much gone; and here and there the bare _stanchions,_ or posts,
were left standing, splitting in two the waves which broke clear over
the deck, lying almost even with the sea. The foremast was snapt off
less than four feet from its base; and the shattered and splintered
remnant looked like the stump of a pine tree thrown over in the woods.
Every time she rolled in the trough of the sea, her open main-hatchway
yawned into view; but was as quickly filled, and submerged again, with
a rushing, gurgling sound, as the water ran into it with the lee-roll.

At the head of the stump of the mainmast, about ten feet above the
deck, something like a sleeve seemed nailed; it was supposed to be the
relic of a jacket, which must have been fastened there by the crew for
a signal, and been frayed out and blown away by the wind.

Lashed, and leaning over sideways against the taffrail, were three
dark, green, grassy objects, that slowly swayed with every roll, but
otherwise were motionless. I saw the captain’s, glass directed toward
them, and heard him say at last, “They must have been dead a long
time.” These were sailors, who long ago had lashed themselves to the
taffrail for safety; but must have famished.

Full of the awful interest of the scene, I surely thought the captain
would lower a boat to bury the bodies, and find out something about the
schooner. But we did not stop at all; passing on our course, without so
much as learning the schooner’s name, though every one supposed her to
be a New Brunswick lumberman.

On the part of the sailors, no surprise was shown that our captain did
not send off a boat to the wreck; but the steerage passengers were
indignant at what they called his barbarity. For me, I could not but
feel amazed and shocked at his indifference; but my subsequent sea
experiences have shown me, that such conduct as this is very common,
though not, of course, when human life can be saved.

So away we sailed, and left her; drifting, drifting on; a garden spot
for barnacles, and a playhouse for the sharks.

“Look there,” said Jackson, hanging over the rail and coughing—“look
there; that’s a sailor’s coffin. Ha! ha! Buttons,” turning round to
me—“how do you like that, Buttons? Wouldn’t you like to take a sail
with them ’ere dead men? Wouldn’t it be nice?” And then he tried to
laugh, but only coughed again. “Don’t laugh at dem poor fellows,” said
Max, looking grave; “do’ you see dar bodies, dar souls are farder off
dan de Cape of Dood Hope.”

“Dood Hope, Dood Hope,” shrieked Jackson, with a horrid grin, mimicking
the Dutchman, “dare is no dood hope for dem, old boy; dey are drowned
and d .... d, as you and I will be, Red Max, one of dese dark nights.”

“No, no,” said Blunt, “all sailors are saved; they have plenty of
squalls here below, but fair weather aloft.”

“And did you get that out of your silly Dream Book, you Greek?” howled
Jackson through a cough. “Don’t talk of heaven to me—it’s a lie—I know
it—and they are all fools that believe in it. Do you think, you Greek,
that there’s any heaven for _you?_ Will they let _you_ in there, with
that tarry hand, and that oily head of hair? Avast! when some shark
gulps you down his hatchway one of these days, you’ll find, that by
dying, you’ll only go from one gale of wind to another; mind that, you
Irish cockney! Yes, you’ll be bolted down like one of your own pills:
and I should like to see the whole ship swallowed down in the Norway
maelstrom, like a box on ’em. That would be a dose of salts for ye!”
And so saying, he went off, holding his hands to his chest, and
coughing, as if his last hour was come.

Every day this Jackson seemed to grow worse and worse, both in body and
mind. He seldom spoke, but to contradict, deride, or curse; and all the
time, though his face grew thinner and thinner, his eyes seemed to
kindle more and more, as if he were going to die out at last, and leave
them burning like tapers before a corpse.

Though he had never attended churches, and knew nothing about
Christianity; no more than a Malay pirate; and though he could not read
a word, yet he was spontaneously an atheist and an infidel; and during
the long night watches, would enter into arguments, to prove that there
was nothing to be believed; nothing to be loved, and nothing worth
living for; but every thing to be hated, in the wide world. He was a
horrid desperado; and like a wild Indian, whom he resembled in his
tawny skin and high cheek bones, he seemed to run amuck at heaven and
earth. He was a Cain afloat; branded on his yellow brow with some
inscrutable curse; and going about corrupting and searing every heart
that beat near him.

But there seemed even more woe than wickedness about the man; and his
wickedness seemed to spring from his woe; and for all his hideousness,
there was that in his eye at times, that was ineffably pitiable and
touching; and though there were moments when I almost hated this
Jackson, yet I have pitied no man as I have pitied him.




CHAPTER XXIII.
AN UNACCOUNTABLE CABIN-PASSENGER, AND A MYSTERIOUS YOUNG LADY


As yet, I have said nothing special about the passengers we carried
out. But before making what little mention I shall of them, you must
know that the Highlander was not a Liverpool liner, or packet-ship,
plying in connection with a sisterhood of packets, at stated intervals,
between the two ports. No: she was only what is called a _regular
trader_ to Liverpool; sailing upon no fixed days, and acting very much
as she pleased, being bound by no obligations of any kind: though in
all her voyages, ever having New York or Liverpool for her destination.
Merchant vessels which are neither liners nor regular traders, among
sailors come under the general head of _transient ships;_ which implies
that they are here to-day, and somewhere else to-morrow, like Mullins’s
dog.

But I had no reason to regret that the Highlander was not a liner; for
aboard of those liners, from all I could gather from those who had
sailed in them, the crew have terrible hard work, owing to their
carrying such a press of sail, in order to make as rapid passages as
possible, and sustain the ship’s reputation for speed. Hence it is,
that although they are the very best of sea-going craft, and built in
the best possible manner, and with the very best materials, yet, a few
years of scudding before the wind, as they do, seriously impairs their
constitutions— like robust young men, who live too fast in their
teens—and they are soon sold out for a song; generally to the people of
Nantucket, New Bedford, and Sag Harbor, who repair and fit them out for
the whaling business.

Thus, the ship that once carried over gay parties of ladies and
gentlemen, as tourists, to Liverpool or London, now carries a crew of
harpooners round Cape Horn into the Pacific. And the mahogany and
bird’s-eye maple cabin, which once held rosewood card-tables and
brilliant coffee-urns, and in which many a bottle of champagne, and
many a bright eye sparkled, _now_ accommodates a bluff Quaker captain
from Martha’s Vineyard; who, perhaps, while lying with his ship in the
Bay of Islands, in New Zealand, entertains a party of naked chiefs and
savages at dinner, in place of the packet-captain doing the honors to
the literati, theatrical stars, foreign princes, and gentlemen of
leisure and fortune, who generally talked gossip, politics, and
nonsense across the table, in transatlantic trips. The broad
quarter-deck, too, where these gentry promenaded, is now often choked
up by the enormous head of the sperm-whale, and vast masses of unctuous
blubber; and every where reeks with oil during the prosecution of the
fishery. Sic _transit gloria mundi!_ Thus departs the pride and glory
of packet-ships! _It is_ like a broken down importer of French silks
embarking in the soap-boning business.

So, not being a liner, the Highlander of course did not have very ample
accommodations for cabin passengers. I believe there were not more than
five or six state-rooms, with two or three berths in each. At any rate,
on this particular voyage she only carried out one regular
cabin-passenger; that is, a person previously unacquainted with the
captain, who paid his fare down, and came on board soberly, and in a
business-like manner with his baggage.

He was an extremely little man, that solitary cabin-passenger—the
passenger who came on board in a business-like manner with his baggage;
never spoke to any one, and the captain seldom spoke to him.

Perhaps he was a deputy from the Deaf and Dumb Institution in New York,
going over to London to address the public in pantomime at Exeter Hall
concerning the signs of the times.

He was always in a brown study; sometimes sitting on the quarter-deck
with arms folded, and head hanging upon his chest. Then he would rise,
and gaze out to windward, as if he had suddenly discovered a friend.
But looking disappointed, would retire slowly into his state-room,
where you could see him through the little window, in an irregular
sitting position, with the back part of him inserted into his berth,
and his head, arms, and legs hanging out, buried in profound
meditation, with his fore-finger aside of his nose. He never was seen
reading; never took a hand at cards; never smoked; never drank wine;
never conversed; and never staid to the dessert at dinner-time.

He seemed the true microcosm, or little world to himself: standing in
no need of levying contributions upon the surrounding universe.
Conjecture was lost in speculating as to who he was, and what was his
business. The sailors, who are always curious with regard to such
matters, and criticise cabin-passengers more than cabin-passengers are
perhaps aware at the time, completely exhausted themselves in
suppositions, some of which are characteristically curious.

One of the crew said he was a mysterious bearer of secret dispatches to
the English court; others opined that he was a traveling surgeon and
bonesetter, but for what reason they thought so, I never could learn;
and others declared that he must either be an unprincipled bigamist,
flying from his last wife and several small children; or a scoundrelly
forger, bank-robber, or general burglar, who was returning to his
beloved country with his ill-gotten booty. One observing sailor was of
opinion that he was an English murderer, overwhelmed with speechless
remorse, and returning home to make a full confession and be hanged.

But it was a little singular, that among all their sage and sometimes
confident opinings, not one charitable one was made; no! they were all
sadly to the prejudice of his moral and religious character. But this
is the way all the world over. Miserable man! could you have had an
inkling of what they thought of you, I know not what you would have
done.

However, not knowing any thing about these surmisings and suspicions,
this mysterious cabin-passenger went on his way, calm, cool, and
collected; never troubled any body, and nobody troubled him. Sometimes,
of a moonlight night he glided about the deck, like the ghost of a
hospital attendant; flitting from mast to mast; now hovering round the
skylight, now vibrating in the vicinity of the binnacle. Blunt, the
Dream Book tar, swore he was a magician; and took an extra dose of
salts, by way of precaution against his spells.

When we were but a few days from port, a comical adventure befell this
cabin-passenger. There is an old custom, still in vogue among some
merchant sailors, of tying fast in the rigging any lubberly landsman of
a passenger who may be detected taking excursions aloft, however
moderate the flight of the awkward fowl. This is called _“making a
spread eagle”_ of the man; and before he is liberated, a promise is
exacted, that before arriving in port, he shall furnish the ship’s
company with money enough for a treat all round.

Now this being one of the perquisites of sailors, they are always on
the keen look-out for an opportunity of levying such contributions upon
incautious strangers; though they never attempt it in presence of the
captain; as for the mates, they purposely avert their eyes, and are
earnestly engaged about something else, whenever they get an inkling of
this proceeding going on. But, with only one poor fellow of a
cabin-passenger on board of the Highlander, and _he_ such a quiet,
unobtrusive, unadventurous wight, there seemed little chance for
levying contributions.

One remarkably pleasant morning, however, what should be seen, half way
up the mizzen rigging, but the figure of our cabin-passenger, holding
on with might and main by all four limbs, and with his head fearfully
turned round, gazing off to the horizon. He looked as if he had the
nightmare; and in some sudden and unaccountable fit of insanity, he
must have been impelled to the taking up of that perilous position.

“Good heavens!” said the mate, who was a bit of a wag, “you will surely
fall, sir! Steward, spread a mattress on deck, under the gentleman!”

But no sooner was our Greenland sailor’s attention called to the sight,
than snatching up some rope-yarn, he ran softly up behind the
passenger, and without speaking a word, began binding him hand and
foot. The stranger was more dumb than ever with amazement; at last
violently remonstrated; but in vain; for as his fearfulness of falling
made him keep his hands glued to the ropes, and so prevented him from
any effectual resistance, he was soon made a handsome _spread-eagle_
of, to the great satisfaction of the crew.

It was now discovered for the first, that this singular passenger
stammered and stuttered very badly, which, perhaps, was the cause of
his reservedness.

“Wha-wha-what i-i-is this f-f-for?”

“Spread-eagle, sir,” said the Greenlander, thinking that those few
words would at once make the matter plain.

“Wha-wha-what that me-me-mean?”

“Treats all round, sir,” said the Greenlander, wondering at the other’s
obtusity, who, however, had never so much as heard of the thing before.

At last, upon his reluctant acquiescence in the demands of the sailor,
and handing him two half-crown pieces, the unfortunate passenger was
suffered to descend.

The last I ever saw of this man was his getting into a cab at Prince’s
Dock Gates in Liverpool, and driving off alone to parts unknown. He had
nothing but a valise with him, and an umbrella; but his pockets looked
stuffed out; perhaps he used them for carpet-bags.

I must now give some account of another and still more mysterious,
though very different, sort of an occupant of the cabin, of whom I have
previously hinted. What say you to a charming young girl?—just the girl
to sing the Dashing White Sergeant; a martial, military-looking girl;
her father must have been a general. Her hair was auburn; her eyes were
blue; her cheeks were white and red; and Captain Riga was her most
devoted.

To the curious questions of the sailors concerning who she was, the
steward used to answer, that she was the daughter of one of the
Liverpool dock-masters, who, for the benefit of her health and the
improvement of her mind, had sent her out to America in the Highlander,
under the captain’s charge, who was his particular friend; and that now
the young lady was returning home from her tour.

And truly the captain proved an attentive father to her, and often
promenaded with her hanging on his arm, past the forlorn bearer of
secret dispatches, who would look up now and then out of his reveries,
and cast a furtive glance of wonder, as if he thought the captain was
audacious.

Considering his beautiful ward, I thought the captain behaved
ungallantly, to say the least, in availing himself of the opportunity
of her charming society, to wear out his remaining old clothes; for no
gentleman ever pretends to save his best coat when a lady is in the
case; indeed, he generally thirsts for a chance to abase it, by
converting it into a pontoon over a puddle, like Sir Walter Raleigh,
that the ladies may not soil the soles of their dainty slippers. But
this Captain Riga was no Raleigh, and hardly any sort of a true
gentleman whatever, as I have formerly declared. Yet, perhaps, he might
have worn his old clothes in this instance, for the express purpose of
proving, by his disdain for the toilet, that he was nothing but the
young lady’s guardian; for many guardians do not care one fig how
shabby they look.

But for all this, the passage out was one long paternal sort of a
shabby flirtation between this hoydenish nymph and the ill-dressed
captain. And surely, if her good mother, were she living, could have
seen this young lady, she would have given her an endless lecture for
her conduct, and a copy of Mrs. Ellis’s Daughters of England to read
and digest. I shall say no more of this anonymous nymph; only, that
when we arrived at Liverpool, she issued from her cabin in a richly
embroidered silk dress, and lace hat and veil, and a sort of Chinese
umbrella or parasol, which one of the sailors declared “spandangalous;”
and the captain followed after in his best broadcloth and beaver, with
a gold-headed cane; and away they went in a carriage, and that was the
last of her; I hope she is well and happy now; but I have some
misgivings.

It now remains to speak of the steerage passengers. There were not more
than twenty or thirty of them, mostly mechanics, returning home, after
a prosperous stay in America, to escort their wives and families back.
These were the only occupants of the steerage that I ever knew of; till
early one morning, in the gray dawn, when we made Cape Clear, the south
point of Ireland, the apparition of a tall Irishman, in a shabby shirt
of bed-ticking, emerged from the fore hatchway, and stood leaning on
the rail, looking landward with a fixed, reminiscent expression, and
diligently scratching its back with both hands. We all started at the
sight, for no one had ever seen the apparition before; and when we
remembered that it must have been burrowing all the passage down in its
bunk, the only probable reason of its so manipulating its back became
shockingly obvious.

I had almost forgotten another passenger of ours, a little boy not four
feet high, an English lad, who, when we were about forty-eight hours
from New York, suddenly appeared on deck, asking for something to eat.

It seems he was the son of a carpenter, a widower, with this only
child, who had gone out to America in the Highlander some six months
previous, where he fell to drinking, and soon died, leaving the boy a
friendless orphan in a foreign land.

For several weeks the boy wandered about the wharves, picking up a
precarious livelihood by sucking molasses out of the casks discharged
from West India ships, and occasionally regaling himself upon stray
oranges and lemons found floating in the docks. He passed his nights
sometimes in a stall in the markets, sometimes in an empty hogshead on
the piers, sometimes in a doorway, and once in the watchhouse, from
which he escaped the next morning, running as he told me, right between
the doorkeeper’s legs, when he was taking another vagrant to task for
repeatedly throwing himself upon the public charities.

At last, while straying along the docks, he chanced to catch sight of
the Highlander, and immediately recognized her as the very ship which
brought him and his father out from England. He at once resolved to
return in her; and, accosting the captain, stated his case, and begged
a passage. The captain refused to give it; but, nothing daunted, the
heroic little fellow resolved to conceal himself on board previous to
the ship’s sailing; which he did, stowing himself away in the
_between-decks;_ and moreover, as he told us, in a narrow space between
two large casks of water, from which he now and then thrust out his
head for air. And once a steerage passenger rose in the night and poked
in and rattled about a stick where he was, thinking him an uncommon
large rat, who was after stealing a passage across the Atlantic. There
are plenty of passengers of that kind continually plying between
Liverpool and New York.

As soon as he divulged the fact of his being on board, which he took
care should not happen till he thought the ship must be out of sight of
land; the captain had him called aft, and after giving him a thorough
shaking, and threatening to toss him overboard as a tit-bit for _John
Shark,_ he told the mate to send him forward among the sailors, and let
him live there. The sailors received him with open arms; but before
caressing him much, they gave him a thorough washing in the
lee-scuppers, when he turned out to be quite a handsome lad, though
thin and pale with the hardships he had suffered. However, by good
nursing and plenty to eat, he soon improved and grew fat; and before
many days was as fine a looking little fellow, as you might pick out of
Queen Victoria’s nursery. The sailors took the warmest interest in him.
One made him a little hat with a long ribbon; another a little jacket;
a third a comical little pair of man-of-war’s-man’s trowsers; so that
in the end, he looked like a juvenile boatswain’s mate. Then the cook
furnished him with a little tin pot and pan; and the steward made him a
present of a pewter tea-spoon; and a steerage passenger gave him a jack
knife. And thus provided, he used to sit at meal times half way up on
the forecastle ladder, making a great racket with his pot and pan, and
merry as a cricket. He was an uncommonly fine, cheerful, clever, arch
little fellow, only six years old, and it was a thousand pities that he
should be abandoned, as he was. Who can say, whether he is fated to be
a convict in New South Wales, or a member of Parliament for Liverpool?
When we got to that port, by the way, a purse was made up for him; the
captain, officers, and the mysterious cabin passenger contributing
their best wishes, and the sailors and poor steerage passengers
something like fifteen dollars in cash and tobacco. But I had almost
forgot to add that the daughter of the dock-master gave him a fine lace
pocket-handkerchief and a card-case to remember her by; very valuable,
but somewhat inappropriate presents. Thus supplied, the little hero
went ashore by himself; and I lost sight of him in the vast crowds
thronging the docks of Liverpool.

I must here mention, as some relief to the impression which Jackson’s
character must have made upon the reader, that in several ways he at
first befriended this boy; but the boy always shrunk from him; till, at
last, stung by his conduct, Jackson spoke to him no more; and seemed to
hate him, harmless as he was, along with all the rest of the world.

As for the Lancashire lad, he was a stupid sort of fellow, as I have
before hinted. So, little interest was taken in him, that he was
permitted to go ashore at last, without a good-by from any person but
one.




CHAPTER XXIV.
HE BEGINS TO HOP ABOUT IN THE RIGGING LIKE A SAINT JAGO’S MONKEY


But we have not got to Liverpool yet; though, as there is little more
to be said concerning the passage out, the Highlander may as well make
sail and get there as soon as possible. The brief interval will perhaps
be profitably employed in relating what progress I made in learning the
duties of a sailor.

After my heroic feat in loosing the main-skysail, the mate entertained
good hopes of my becoming a rare mariner. In the fullness of his heart,
he ordered me to turn over the superintendence of the chicken-coop to
the Lancashire boy; which I did, very willingly. After that, I took
care to show the utmost alacrity in running aloft, which by this time
became mere fun for me; and nothing delighted me more than to sit on
one of the topsail-yards, for hours together, helping Max or the
Greenlander as they worked at the rigging.

At sea, the sailors are continually engaged in _“parcelling,”
“serving,”_ and in a thousand ways ornamenting and repairing the
numberless shrouds and stays; mending sails, or turning one side of the
deck into a rope-walk, where they manufacture a clumsy sort of twine,
called _spun-yarn._ This is spun with a winch; and many an hour the
Lancashire boy had to play the part of an engine, and contribute the
motive power. For material, they use odds and ends of old rigging
called _“junk,”_ the yarns of which are picked to pieces, and then
twisted into new combinations, something as most books are
manufactured. This “junk” is bought at the junk shops along the
wharves; outlandish looking dens, generally subterranean, full of old
iron, old shrouds, spars, rusty blocks, and superannuated tackles; and
kept by villainous looking old men, in tarred trowsers, and with yellow
beards like oakum. They look like wreckers; and the scattered goods
they expose for sale, involuntarily remind one of the sea-beach,
covered with keels and cordage, swept ashore in a gale.

Yes, I was now as nimble as a monkey in the rigging, and at the cry of
_“tumble up there, my hearties, and take in sail,” I_ was among the
first ground-and-lofty tumblers, that sprang aloft at the word.

But the first time we reefed top-sails of a dark night, and I found
myself hanging over the yard with eleven others, the ship plunging and
rearing like a mad horse, till I felt like being jerked off the spar;
then, indeed, I thought of a feather-bed at home, and hung on with
tooth and nail; with no chance for snoring. But a few repetitions, soon
made me used to it; and before long, I tied my reef-point as quickly
and expertly as the best of them; never making what they call a
_“granny-knot,”_ and slipt down on deck by the bare stays, instead of
the shrouds. It is surprising, how soon a boy overcomes his timidity
about going aloft. For my own part, my nerves became as steady as the
earth’s diameter, and I felt as fearless on the royal yard, as Sam
Patch on the cliff of Niagara. To my amazement, also, I found, that
running up the rigging at sea, especially during a squall, was much
easier than while lying in port. For as you always go up on the
windward side, and the ship leans over, it makes more of a _stairs_ of
the rigging; whereas, in harbor, it is almost straight up and down.

Besides, the pitching and rolling only imparts a pleasant sort of
vitality to the vessel; so that the difference in being aloft in a ship
at sea, and a ship in harbor, is pretty much the same, as riding a real
live horse and a wooden one. And even if the live charger should pitch
you over his head, _that_ would be much more satisfactory, than an
inglorious fall from the other.

I took great delight in furling the top-gallant sails and royals in a
hard blow; which duty required two hands on the yard.

There was a wild delirium about it; a fine rushing of the blood about
the heart; and a glad, thrilling, and throbbing of the whole system, to
find yourself tossed up at every pitch into the clouds of a stormy sky,
and hovering like a judgment angel between heaven and earth; both hands
free, with one foot in the rigging, and one somewhere behind you in the
air. The sail would fill out like a balloon, with a report like a small
cannon, and then collapse and sink away into a handful. And the feeling
of mastering the rebellious canvas, and tying it down like a slave to
the spar, and binding it over and over with the _gasket,_ had a touch
of pride and power in it, such as young King Richard must have felt,
when he trampled down the insurgents of Wat Tyler.

As for steering, they never would let me go to the helm, except during
a calm, when I and the figure-head on the bow were about equally
employed.

By the way, that figure-head was a passenger I forgot to make mention
of before.

He was a gallant six-footer of a Highlander _“in full fig,”_ with
bright tartans, bare knees, barred leggings, and blue bonnet and the
most vermilion of cheeks. He was game to his wooden marrow, and stood
up to it through thick and thin; one foot a little advanced, and his
right arm stretched forward, daring on the waves. In a gale of wind it
was glorious to watch him standing at his post like a hero, and
plunging up and down the watery Highlands and Lowlands, as the ship
went roaming on her way. He was a veteran with many wounds of many
sea-fights; and when he got to Liverpool a figure-head-builder there,
amputated his left leg, and gave him another wooden one, which I am
sorry to say, did not fit him very well, for ever after he looked as if
he limped. Then this figure-head-surgeon gave him another nose, and
touched up one eye, and repaired a rent in his tartans. After that the
painter came and made his toilet all over again; giving him a new suit
throughout, with a plaid of a beautiful pattern.

I do not know what has become of Donald now, but I hope he is safe and
snug with a handsome pension in the “Sailors’-Snug-Harbor” on Staten
Island.

The reason why they gave me such a slender chance of learning to steer
was this. I was quite young and raw, and steering a ship is a great
art, upon which much depends; especially the making a short passage;
for if the helmsman be a clumsy, careless fellow, or ignorant of his
duty, he keeps the ship going about in a melancholy state of indecision
as to its precise destination; so that on a voyage to Liverpool, it may
be pointing one while for Gibraltar, then for Rotterdam, and now for
John o’ Groat’s; all of which is worse than wasted time. Whereas, a
true steersman keeps her to her work night and day; and tries to make a
bee-line from port to port.

Then, in a sudden squall, inattention, or want of quickness at the
helm, might make the ship _“lurch to”—or “bring her by the lee.”_ And
what those things are, the cabin passengers would never find out, when
they found themselves going down, down, down, and bidding good-by
forever to the moon and stars.

And they little think, many of them, fine gentlemen and ladies that
they are, what an important personage, and how much to be had in
reverence, is the rough fellow in the pea-jacket, whom they see
standing at the wheel, now cocking his eye aloft, and then peeping at
the compass, or looking out to windward.

Why, that fellow has all your lives and eternities in his hand; and
with one small and almost imperceptible motion of a spoke, in a gale of
wind, might give a vast deal of work to surrogates and lawyers, in
proving last wills and testaments.

Ay, you may well stare at him now. He does not look much like a man who
might play into the hands of an heir-at-law, does he? Yet such is the
case. Watch him close, therefore; take him down into your state-room
occasionally after a stormy watch, and make a friend of him. A glass of
cordial will do it. And if you or your heirs are interested with the
underwriters, then also have an eye on him. And if you remark, that of
the crew, all the men who come to the helm are careless, or
inefficient; and if you observe the captain scolding them often, and
crying out: _“Luff, you rascal; she’s falling off!”_ or, _“Keep her
steady, you scoundrel, you’re boxing the compass!”_ then hurry down to
your state-room, and if you have not yet made a will, get out your
stationery and go at it; and when it is done, seal it up in a bottle,
like Columbus’ log, and it may possibly drift ashore, when you are
drowned in the next gale of wind.




CHAPTER XXV.
QUARTER-DECK FURNITURE


Though, for reasons hinted at above, they would not let me steer, I
contented myself with learning the compass, a graphic facsimile of
which I drew on a blank leaf of the _“Wealth of Nations,”_ and studied
it every morning, like the multiplication table.

I liked to peep in at the binnacle, and watch the needle; and I
wondered how it was that it pointed north, rather than south or west;
for I do not know that any reason can be given why it points in the
precise direction it does. One would think, too, that, as since the
beginning of the world almost, the tide of emigration has been setting
west, the needle would point that way; whereas, it is forever pointing
its fixed fore-finger toward the Pole, where there are few inducements
to attract a sailor, unless it be plenty of ice for mint-juleps.

Our binnacle, by the way, the place that holds a ship’s compasses,
deserves a word of mention. It was a little house, about the bigness of
a common bird-cage, with sliding panel doors, and two drawing-rooms
within, and constantly perched upon a stand, right in front of the
helm. It had two chimney stacks to carry off the smoke of the lamp that
burned in it by night.

It was painted green, and on two sides had Venetian blinds; and on one
side two glazed sashes; so that it looked like a cool little summer
retreat, a snug bit of an arbor at the end of a shady garden lane. Had
I been the captain, I would have planted vines in boxes, and placed
them so as to overrun this binnacle; or I would have put canary-birds
within; and so made an aviary of it. It is surprising what a different
air may be imparted to the meanest thing by the dainty hand of taste.
Nor must I omit the helm itself, which was one of a new construction,
and a particular favorite of the captain. It was a complex system of
cogs and wheels and spindles, all of polished brass, and looked
something like a printing-press, or power-loom. The sailors, however,
did not like it much, owing to the casualties that happened to their
imprudent fingers, by catching in among the cogs and other intricate
contrivances. Then, sometimes in a calm, when the sudden swells would
lift the ship, the helm would fetch a lurch, and send the helmsman
revolving round like Ixion, often seriously hurting him; a sort of
breaking on the wheel.

The _harness-cask,_ also, a sort of sea side-board, or rather
meat-safe, in which a week’s allowance of salt pork and beef is kept,
deserves being chronicled. It formed part of the standing furniture of
the quarter-deck. Of an oval shape, it was banded round with hoops all
silver-gilt, with gilded bands secured with gilded screws, and a gilded
padlock, richly chased. This formed the captain’s smoking-seat, where
he would perch himself of an afternoon, a tasseled Chinese cap upon his
head, and a fragrant Havanna between his white and canine-looking
teeth. He took much solid comfort, Captain Riga.

Then the magnificent _capstan!_ The pride and glory of the whole ship’s
company, the constant care and dandled darling of the cook, whose duty
it was to keep it polished like a teapot; and it was an object of
distant admiration to the steerage passengers. Like a parlor
center-table, it stood full in the middle of the quarter-deck, radiant
with brazen stars, and variegated with diamond-shaped veneerings of
mahogany and satin wood. This was the captain’s lounge, and the chief
mate’s secretary, in the bar-holes keeping paper and pencil for
memorandums.

I might proceed and speak of the _booby-hatch,_ used as a sort of
settee by the officers, and the _fife-rail_ round the mainmast,
inclosing a little ark of canvas, painted green, where a small white
dog with a blue ribbon round his neck, belonging to the dock-master’s
daughter, used to take his morning walks, and air himself in this small
edition of the New York Bowling-Green.




CHAPTER XXVI.
A SAILOR A JACK OF ALL TRADES


As I began to learn my sailor duties, and show activity in running
aloft, the men, I observed, treated me with a little more
consideration, though not at all relaxing in a certain air of
professional superiority. For the mere knowing of the names of the
ropes, and familiarizing yourself with their places, so that you can
lay hold of them in the darkest night; and the loosing and furling of
the canvas, and reefing topsails, and hauling braces; all this, though
of course forming an indispensable part of a seaman’s vocation, and the
business in which he is principally engaged; yet these are things which
a beginner of ordinary capacity soon masters, and which are far
inferior to many other matters familiar to an _“able seaman.”_

What did I know, for instance, about _striking a top-gallant-mast,_ and
sending it down on deck in a gale of wind? Could I have _turned in a
dead-eye,_ or in the approved nautical style have _clapt a seizing on
the main-stay?_ What did I know of _“passing a gammoning,” “reiving a
Burton,” “strapping a shoe-block,” “clearing a foul hawse,”_ and
innumerable other intricacies?

The business of a thorough-bred sailor is a special calling, as much of
a regular trade as a carpenter’s or locksmith’s. Indeed, it requires
considerably more adroitness, and far more versatility of talent.

In the English merchant service boys serve a long apprenticeship to the
sea, of seven years. Most of them first enter the Newcastle colliers,
where they see a great deal of severe coasting service. In an old copy
of the Letters of Junius, belonging to my father, I remember reading,
that coal to supply the city of London could be dug at Blackheath, and
sold for one half the price that the people of London then paid for it;
but the Government would not suffer the mines to be opened, as it would
destroy the great nursery for British seamen.

A thorough sailor must understand much of other avocations. He must be
a bit of an embroiderer, to work fanciful collars of hempen lace about
the shrouds; he must be something of a weaver, to weave mats of
rope-yarns for lashings to the boats; he must have a touch of
millinery, so as to tie graceful bows and knots, such as _Matthew
Walker’s roses,_ and _Turk’s heads;_ he must be a bit of a musician, in
order to sing out at the halyards; he must be a sort of jeweler, to set
dead-eyes in the standing rigging; he must be a carpenter, to enable
him to make a jurymast out of a yard in case of emergency; he must be a
sempstress, to darn and mend the sails; a ropemaker, to twist _marline_
and _Spanish foxes;_ a blacksmith, to make hooks and thimbles for the
blocks: in short, he must be a sort of Jack of all trades, in order to
master his own. And this, perhaps, in a greater or less degree, is
pretty much the case with all things else; for you know nothing till
you know all; which is the reason we never know anything.

A sailor, also, in working at the rigging, uses special tools peculiar
to his calling—_fids, serving-mallets, toggles, prickers,
marlingspikes, palms, heavers,_ and many more. The smaller sort he
generally carries with him from ship to ship in a sort of canvas
reticule.

The estimation in which a ship’s crew hold the knowledge of such
accomplishments as these, is expressed in the phrase they apply to one
who is a clever practitioner. To distinguish such a mariner from those
who merely _“hand, reef, and steer,”_ that is, run aloft, furl sails,
haul ropes, and stand at the wheel, they say he is _“a sailor-man”_
which means that he not only knows how to reef a topsail, but is an
artist in the rigging.

Now, alas! I had no chance given me to become initiated in this art and
mystery; no further, at least, than by looking on, and watching how
that these things might be done as well as others, the reason was, that
I had only shipped for this one voyage in the Highlander, a short
voyage too; and it was not worth while to teach _me_ any thing, the
fruit of which instructions could be only reaped by the next ship I
might belong to. All they wanted of me was the good-will of my muscles,
and the use of my backbone—comparatively small though it was at that
time—by way of a lever, for the above-mentioned artists to employ when
wanted. Accordingly, when any embroidery was going on in the rigging, I
was set to the most inglorious avocations; as in the merchant service
it is a religious maxim to keep the hands always employed at something
or other, never mind what, during their watch on deck.

Often furnished with a club-hammer, they swung me over the bows in a
bowline, to pound the rust off the anchor: a most monotonous, and to me
a most uncongenial and irksome business. There was a remarkable
fatality attending the various hammers I carried over with me. Somehow
they _would_ drop out of my hands into the sea. But the supply of
reserved hammers seemed unlimited: also the blessings and benedictions
I received from the chief mate for my clumsiness.

At other times, they set me to picking oakum, like a convict, which
hempen business disagreeably obtruded thoughts of halters and the
gallows; or whittling belaying-pins, like a Down-Easter.

However, I endeavored to bear it all like a young philosopher, and
whiled away the tedious hours by gazing through a port-hole while my
hands were plying, and repeating Lord Byron’s Address to the Ocean,
which I had often spouted on the stage at the High School at home.

Yes, I got used to all these matters, and took most things coolly, in
the spirit of Seneca and the stoics.

All but the _“turning out”_ or rising from your berth when the watch
was called at night—_that_ I never fancied. It was a sort of
acquaintance, which the more I cultivated, the more I shrunk from; a
thankless, miserable business, truly.

Consider that after walking the deck for four full hours, you go below
to sleep: and while thus innocently employed in reposing your wearied
limbs, you are started up—it seems but the next instant after closing
your lids—and hurried on deck again, into the same disagreeably dark
and, perhaps, stormy night, from which you descended into the
forecastle.

The previous interval of slumber was almost wholly lost to me; at least
the golden opportunity could not be appreciated: for though it is
usually deemed a comfortable thing to be asleep, yet at the time no one
is conscious that he is so enjoying himself. Therefore I made a little
private arrangement with the Lancashire lad, who was in the other
watch, just to step below occasionally, and shake me, and whisper in my
ear—_“Watch below, Buttons; watch below”—_which pleasantly reminded me
of the delightful fact. Then I would turn over on my side, and take
another nap; and in this manner I enjoyed several complete watches in
my bunk to the other sailor’s one. I recommend the plan to all landsmen
contemplating a voyage to sea.

But notwithstanding all these contrivances, the dreadful sequel could
not be avoided. Eight bells would at last be struck, and the men on
deck, exhilarated by the prospect of changing places with us, would
call the watch in a most provoking but mirthful and facetious style.

As thus:—

“Starboard watch, ahoy! eight bells there, below! Tumble up, my lively
hearties; steamboat alongside waiting for your trunks: bear a hand,
bear a hand with your knee-buckles, my sweet and pleasant fellows! fine
shower-bath here on deck. Hurrah, hurrah! your ice-cream is getting
cold!”

Whereupon some of the old croakers who were getting into their trowsers
would reply with—“Oh, stop your gabble, will you? don’t be in such a
hurry, now. You feel sweet, don’t you?” with other exclamations, some
of which were full of fury.

And it was not a little curious to remark, that at the expiration of
the ensuing watch, the tables would be turned; and we on deck became
the wits and jokers, and those below the grizzly bears and growlers.




CHAPTER XXVII.
HE GETS A PEEP AT IRELAND, AND AT LAST ARRIVES AT LIVERPOOL


The Highlander was not a grayhound, not a very fast sailer; and so, the
passage, which some of the packet ships make in fifteen or sixteen
days, employed us about thirty.

At last, one morning I came on deck, and they told me that Ireland was
in sight.

Ireland in sight! A foreign country actually visible! I peered hard,
but could see nothing but a bluish, cloud-like spot to the northeast.
Was that Ireland? Why, there was nothing remarkable about that; nothing
startling. If _that’s_ the way a foreign country looks, I might as well
have staid at home.

Now what, exactly, I had fancied the shore would look like, I can not
say; but I had a vague idea that it would be something strange and
wonderful. However, there it was; and as the light increased and the
ship sailed nearer and nearer, the land began to magnify, and I gazed
at it with increasing interest.

Ireland! I thought of Robert Emmet, and that last speech of his before
Lord Norbury; I thought of Tommy Moore, and his amatory verses: I
thought of Curran, Grattan, Plunket, and O’Connell; I thought of my
uncle’s ostler, Patrick Flinnigan; and I thought of the shipwreck of
the gallant Albion, tost to pieces on the very shore now in sight; and
I thought I should very much like to leave the ship and visit Dublin
and the Giant’s Causeway.

Presently a fishing-boat drew near, and I rushed to get a view of it;
but it was a very ordinary looking boat, bobbing up and down, as any
other boat would have done; yet, when I considered that the solitary
man in it was actually a born native of the land in sight; that in all
probability he had never been in America, and knew nothing about my
friends at home, I began to think that he looked somewhat strange.

He was a very fluent fellow, and as soon as we were within hailing
distance, cried out—“Ah, my fine sailors, from Ameriky, ain’t ye, my
beautiful sailors?” And concluded by calling upon us to stop and heave
a rope. Thinking he might have something important to communicate, the
mate accordingly backed the main yard, and a rope being thrown, the
stranger kept hauling in upon it, and coiling it down, crying, “pay
out! pay out, my honeys; ah! but you’re noble fellows!” Till at last
the mate asked him why he did not come alongside, adding, “Haven’t you
enough rope yet?”

“Sure and I have,” replied the fisherman, “and it’s time for Pat to cut
and run!” and so saying, his knife severed the rope, and with a
Kilkenny grin, he sprang to his tiller, put his little craft before the
wind, and bowled away from us, with some fifteen fathoms of our
tow-line.

“And may the Old Boy hurry after you, and hang you in your stolen hemp,
you Irish blackguard!” cried the mate, shaking his fist at the receding
boat, after recovering from his first fit of amazement.

Here, then, was a beautiful introduction to the eastern hemisphere;
fairly robbed before striking soundings. This trick upon experienced
travelers certainly beat all I had ever heard about the wooden nutmegs
and bass-wood pumpkin seeds of Connecticut. And I thought if there were
any more Hibernians like our friend Pat, the Yankee peddlers might as
well give it up.

The next land we saw was Wales. It was high noon, and a long line of
purple mountains lay like banks of clouds against the east.

Could this be really Wales?—Wales?—and I thought of the Prince of
Wales.

And did a real queen with a diadem reign over that very land I was
looking at, with the identical eyes in my own head?—And then I thought
of a grandfather of mine, who had fought against the ancestor of this
queen at Bunker’s Hill.

But, after all, the general effect of these mountains was mortifyingly
like the general effect of the Kaatskill Mountains on the Hudson River.

With a light breeze, we sailed on till next day, when we made Holyhead
and Anglesea. Then it fell almost calm, and what little wind we had,
was ahead; so we kept tacking to and fro, just gliding through the
water, and always hovering in sight of a snow-white tower in the
distance, which might have been a fort, or a light-house. I lost myself
in conjectures as to what sort of people might be tenanting that lonely
edifice, and whether they knew any thing about us.

The third day, with a good wind over the taffrail, we arrived so near
our destination, that we took a pilot at dusk.

He, and every thing connected with him were very different from our New
York pilot. In the first place, the pilot boat that brought him was a
plethoric looking sloop-rigged boat, with flat bows, that went wheezing
through the water; quite in contrast to the little gull of a schooner,
that bade us adieu off Sandy Hook. Aboard of her were ten or twelve
other pilots, fellows with shaggy brows, and muffled in shaggy coats,
who sat grouped together on deck like a fire-side of bears, wintering
in Aroostook. They must have had fine sociable times, though, together;
cruising about the Irish Sea in quest of Liverpool-bound vessels;
smoking cigars, drinking brandy-and-water, and spinning yarns; till at
last, one by one, they are all scattered on board of different ships,
and meet again by the side of a blazing sea-coal fire in some Liverpool
taproom, and prepare for another yachting.

Now, when this English pilot boarded us, I stared at him as if he had
been some wild animal just escaped from the Zoological Gardens; for
here was a real live Englishman, just from England. Nevertheless, as he
soon fell to ordering us here and there, and swearing vociferously in a
language quite familiar to me; I began to think him very common-place,
and considerable of a bore after all.

After running till about midnight, we _“hove-to”_ near the mouth of the
Mersey; and next morning, before day-break, took the first of the
flood; and with a fair wind, stood into the river; which, at its mouth,
is quite an arm of the sea. Presently, in the misty twilight, we passed
immense buoys, and caught sight of distant objects on shore, vague and
shadowy shapes, like Ossian’s ghosts.

As I stood leaning over the side, and trying to summon up some image of
Liverpool, to see how the reality would answer to my conceit; and while
the fog, and mist, and gray dawn were investing every thing with a
mysterious interest, I was startled by the doleful, dismal sound of a
great bell, whose slow intermitting tolling seemed in unison with the
solemn roll of the billows. I thought I had never heard so boding a
sound; a sound that seemed to speak of judgment and the resurrection,
like belfry-mouthed Paul of Tarsus.

It was not in the direction of the shore; but seemed to come out of the
vaults of the sea, and out of the mist and fog.

Who was dead, and what could it be?

I soon learned from my shipmates, that this was the famous _Bett-Buoy,_
which is precisely what its name implies; and tolls fast or slow,
according to the agitation of the waves. In a calm, it is dumb; in a
moderate breeze, it tolls gently; but in a gale, it is an alarum like
the tocsin, warning all mariners to flee. But it seemed fuller of
dirges for the past, than of monitions for the future; and no one can
give ear to it, without thinking of the sailors who sleep far beneath
it at the bottom of the deep.

As we sailed ahead the river contracted. The day came, and soon,
passing two lofty land-marks on the Lancashire shore, we rapidly drew
near the town, and at last, came to anchor in the stream.

Looking shoreward, I beheld lofty ranges of dingy warehouses, which
seemed very deficient in the elements of the marvelous; and bore a most
unexpected resemblance to the ware-houses along South-street in New
York. There was nothing strange; nothing extraordinary about them.
There they stood; a row of calm and collected ware-houses; very good
and substantial edifices, doubtless, and admirably adapted to the ends
had in view by the builders; but plain, matter-of-fact ware-houses,
nevertheless, and that was all that could be said of them.

To be sure, I did not expect that every house in Liverpool must be a
Leaning Tower of Pisa, or a Strasbourg Cathedral; but yet, these
edifices I must confess, were a sad and bitter disappointment to me.

But it was different with Larry the whaleman; who to my surprise,
looking about him delighted, exclaimed, “Why, this ’ere is a
considerable place—I’m _dummed if_ it ain’t quite a place.—Why, them
’ere houses is considerable houses. It beats the coast of Afriky, all
hollow; nothing like this in _Madagasky,_ I tell you;—I’m _dummed,_
boys if Liverpool ain’t a city!”

Upon this occasion, indeed, Larry altogether forgot his hostility to
civilization. Having been so long accustomed to associate foreign lands
with the savage places of the Indian Ocean, he had been under the
impression, that Liverpool must be a town of bamboos, situated in some
swamp, and whose inhabitants turned their attention principally to the
cultivation of log-wood and curing of flying-fish. For that any great
commercial city existed three thousand miles from home, was a thing, of
which Larry had never before had a _“realizing sense.”_ He was
accordingly astonished and delighted; and began to feel a sort of
consideration for the country which could boast so extensive a town.
Instead of holding Queen Victoria on a par with the Queen of
Madagascar, as he had been accustomed to do; he ever after alluded to
that lady with feeling and respect.

As for the other seamen, the sight of a foreign country seemed to
kindle no enthusiasm in them at all: no emotion in the least. They
looked around them with great presence of mind, and acted precisely as
you or I would, if, after a morning’s absence round the corner, we
found ourselves returning home. Nearly all of them had made frequent
voyages to Liverpool.

Not long after anchoring, several boats came off; and from one of them
stept a neatly-dressed and very respectable-looking woman, some thirty
years of age, I should think, carrying a bundle. Coming forward among
the sailors, she inquired for Max the Dutchman, who immediately was
forthcoming, and saluted her by the mellifluous appellation of _Sally._

Now during the passage, Max in discoursing to me of Liverpool, had
often assured me, that that city had the honor of containing a spouse
of his; and that in all probability, I would have the pleasure of
seeing her. But having heard a good many stories about the bigamies of
seamen, and their having wives and sweethearts in every port, the round
world over; and having been an eye-witness to a nuptial parting between
this very Max and a lady in New York; I put down this relation of his,
for what I thought it might reasonably be worth. What was my
astonishment, therefore, to see this really decent, civil woman coming
with a neat parcel of Max’s shore clothes, all washed, plaited, and
ironed, and ready to put on at a moment’s warning.

They stood apart a few moments giving loose to those transports of
pleasure, which always take place, I suppose, between man and wife
after long separations.

At last, after many earnest inquiries as to how he had behaved himself
in New York; and concerning the state of his wardrobe; and going down
into the forecastle, and inspecting it in person, Sally departed;
having exchanged her bundle of clean clothes for a bundle of soiled
ones, and this was precisely what the New York wife had done for Max,
not thirty days previous.

So long as we laid in port, Sally visited the Highlander daily; and
approved herself a neat and expeditious getter-up of duck frocks and
trowsers, a capital tailoress, and as far as I could see, a very
well-behaved, discreet, and reputable woman.

But from all I had seen of her, I should suppose Meg, the New York
wife, to have been equally well-behaved, discreet, and reputable; and
equally devoted to the keeping in good order Max’s wardrobe.

And when we left England at last, Sally bade Max good-by, just as Meg
had done; and when we arrived at New York, Meg greeted Max precisely as
Sally had greeted him in Liverpool. Indeed, a pair of more amiable
wives never belonged to one man; they never quarreled, or had so much
as a difference of any kind; the whole broad Atlantic being between
them; and Max was equally polite and civil to both. For many years, he
had been going Liverpool and New York voyages, plying between wife and
wife with great regularity, and sure of receiving a hearty domestic
welcome on either side of the ocean.

Thinking this conduct of his, however, altogether wrong and every way
immoral, I once ventured to express to him my opinion on the subject.
But I never did so again. He turned round on me, very savagely; and
after rating me soundly for meddling in concerns not my own, concluded
by asking me triumphantly, whether _old King Sol,_ as he called the son
of David, did not have a whole frigate-full of wives; and that being
the case, whether he, a poor sailor, did not have just as good a right
to have two? “What was not wrong then, is right now,” said Max; “so,
mind your eye, Buttons, or I’ll crack your pepper-box for you!”




CHAPTER XXVIII.
HE GOES TO SUPPER AT THE SIGN OF THE BALTIMORE CLIPPER


In the afternoon our pilot was all alive with his orders; we hove up
the anchor, and after a deal of pulling, and hauling, and jamming
against other ships, we wedged our way through a lock at high tide; and
about dark, succeeded in working up to a berth in _Prince’s Dock._ The
hawsers and tow-lines being then coiled away, the crew were told to go
ashore, select their boarding-house, and sit down to supper.

Here it must be mentioned, that owing to the strict but necessary
regulations of the Liverpool docks, no fires of any kind are allowed on
board the vessels within them; and hence, though the sailors are
supposed to sleep in the forecastle, yet they must get their meals
ashore, or live upon cold potatoes. To a ship, the American merchantmen
adopt the former plan; the owners, of course, paying the landlord’s
bill; which, in a large crew remaining at Liverpool more than six
weeks, as we of the Highlander did, forms no inconsiderable item in the
expenses of the voyage. Other ships, however—the economical Dutch and
Danish, for instance, and sometimes the prudent Scotch—feed their
luckless tars in dock, with precisely the same fare which they give
them at sea; taking their salt junk ashore to be cooked, which, indeed,
is but scurvy sort of treatment, since it is very apt to induce the
scurvy. A parsimonious proceeding like this is regarded with
immeasurable disdain by the crews of the New York vessels, who, if
their captains treated them after that fashion, would soon bolt and
run.

It was quite dark, when we all sprang ashore; and, for the first time,
I felt dusty particles of the renowned British soil penetrating into my
eyes and lungs. As for _stepping_ on it, that was out of the question,
in the well-paved and flagged condition of the streets; and I did not
have an opportunity to do so till some time afterward, when I got out
into the country; and then, indeed, I saw England, and snuffed its
immortal loam—but not till then.

Jackson led the van; and after stopping at a tavern, took us up this
street, and down that, till at last he brought us to a narrow lane,
filled with boarding-houses, spirit-vaults, and sailors. Here we
stopped before the sign of a Baltimore Clipper, flanked on one side by
a gilded bunch of grapes and a bottle, and on the other by the British
Unicorn and American Eagle, lying down by each other, like the lion and
lamb in the millennium.—A very judicious and tasty device, showing a
delicate apprehension of the propriety of conciliating American sailors
in an English boarding-house; and yet in no way derogating from the
honor and dignity of England, but placing the two nations, indeed, upon
a footing of perfect equality.

Near the unicorn was a very small animal, which at first I took for a
young unicorn; but it looked more like a yearling lion. It was holding
up one paw, as if it had a splinter in it; and on its head was a sort
of basket-hilted, low-crowned hat, without a rim. I asked a sailor
standing by, what this animal meant, when, looking at me with a grin,
he answered, “Why, youngster, don’t you know what that means? It’s a
young jackass, limping off with a kedgeree pot of rice out of the
cuddy.”

Though it was an English boarding-house, it was kept by a broken-down
American mariner, one Danby, a dissolute, idle fellow, who had married
a buxom English wife, and now lived upon her industry; for the lady,
and not the sailor, proved to be the head of the establishment.

She was a hale, good-looking woman, about forty years old, and among
the seamen went by the name of _“Handsome Mary.”_ But though, from the
dissipated character of her spouse, Mary had become the business
personage of the house, bought the marketing, overlooked the tables,
and conducted all the more important arrangements, yet she was by no
means an Amazon to her husband, if she _did_ play a masculine part in
other matters. No; and the more is the pity, poor Mary seemed too much
attached to Danby, to seek to rule him as a termagant. Often she went
about her household concerns with the tears in her eyes, when, after a
fit of intoxication, this brutal husband of hers had been beating her.
The sailors took her part, and many a time volunteered to give him a
thorough thrashing before her eyes; but Mary would beg them not to do
so, as Danby would, no doubt, be a better boy next time.

But there seemed no likelihood of this, so long as that abominable bar
of his stood upon the premises. As you entered the passage, it stared
upon you on one side, ready to entrap all guests.

It was a grotesque, old-fashioned, castellated sort of a sentry-box,
made of a smoky-colored wood, and with a grating in front, that lifted
up like a portcullis. And here would this Danby sit all the day long;
and when customers grew thin, would patronize his own ale himself,
pouring down mug after mug, as if he took himself for one of his own
quarter-casks.

Sometimes an old crony of his, one Bob Still, would come in; and then
they would occupy the sentry-box together, and swill their beer in
concert. This pot-friend of Danby was portly as a dray-horse, and had a
round, sleek, oily head, twinkling eyes, and moist red cheeks. He was a
lusty troller of ale-songs; and, with his mug in his hand, would lean
his waddling bulk partly out of the sentry-box, singing:

“No frost, no snow, no wind, I trow,
    Can hurt me if I wold,
I am so wrapt, and thoroughly lapt
    In jolly good ale and old,—
I stuff my skin so full within,
    Of jolly good ale and old.”


Or this,

“Four wines and brandies I detest,
Here’s richer juice from barley press’d.
It is the quintessence of malt,
And they that drink it want no salt.
Come, then, quick come, and take this beer,
And water henceforth you’ll forswear.”


Alas! Handsome Mary. What avail all thy private tears and remonstrances
with the incorrigible Danby, so long as that brewery of a toper, Bob
Still, daily eclipses thy threshold with the vast diameter of his
paunch, and enthrones himself in the sentry-box, holding divided rule
with thy spouse?

The more he drinks, the fatter and rounder waxes Bob; and the songs
pour out as the ale pours in, on the well-known principle, that the air
in a vessel is displaced and expelled, as the liquid rises higher and
higher in it.

But as for Danby, the miserable Yankee grows sour on good cheer, and
dries up the thinner for every drop of fat ale he imbibes. It is plain
and demonstrable, that much ale is not good for Yankees, and operates
differently upon them from what it does upon a Briton: ale must be
drank in a fog and a drizzle.

Entering the sign of the Clipper, Jackson ushered us into a small room
on one side, and shortly after, Handsome Mary waited upon us with a
courtesy, and received the compliments of several old guests among our
crew. She then disappeared to provide our supper. While my shipmates
were now engaged in tippling, and talking with numerous old
acquaintances of theirs in the neighborhood, who thronged about the
door, I remained alone in the little room, meditating profoundly upon
the fact, that I was now seated upon an English bench, under an English
roof, in an English tavern, forming an integral part of the English
empire. It was a staggering fact, but none the less true.

I examined the place attentively; it was a long, narrow, little room,
with one small arched window with red curtains, looking out upon a
smoky, untidy yard, bounded by a dingy brick-wall, the top of which was
horrible with pieces of broken old bottles, stuck into mortar.

A dull lamp swung overhead, placed in a wooden ship suspended from the
ceiling. The walls were covered with a paper, representing an endless
succession of vessels of all nations continually circumnavigating the
apartment. By way of a pictorial mainsail to one of these ships, a map
was hung against it, representing in faded colors the flags of all
nations. From the street came a confused uproar of ballad-singers,
bawling women, babies, and drunken sailors.

And this is England?

But where are the old abbeys, and the York Minsters, and the lord
mayors, and coronations, and the May-poles, and fox-hunters, and Derby
races, and the dukes and duchesses, and the Count d’Orsays, which, from
all my reading, I had been in the habit of associating with England?
Not the most distant glimpse of them was to be seen.

Alas! Wellingborough, thought I, I fear you stand but a poor chance to
see the sights. You are nothing but a poor sailor boy; and the Queen is
not going to send a deputation of noblemen to invite you to St.
James’s.

It was then, I began to see, that my prospects of seeing the world as a
sailor were, after all, but very doubtful; for sailors only go _round_
the world, without going _into_ it; and their reminiscences of travel
are only a dim recollection of a chain of tap-rooms surrounding the
globe, parallel with the Equator. They but touch the perimeter of the
circle; hover about the edges of terra-firma; and only land upon
wharves and pier-heads. They would dream as little of traveling inland
to see Kenilworth, or Blenheim Castle, as they would of sending a car
overland to the Pope, when they touched at Naples.

From these reveries I was soon roused, by a servant girl hurrying from
room to room, in shrill tones exclaiming, “Supper, supper ready.”

Mounting a rickety staircase, we entered a room on the second floor.
Three tall brass candlesticks shed a smoky light upon smoky walls, of
what had once been sea-blue, covered with sailor-scrawls of foul
anchors, lovers’ sonnets, and ocean ditties. On one side, nailed
against the wainscot in a row, were the four knaves of cards, each Jack
putting his best foot foremost as usual. What these signified I never
heard.

But such ample cheer! Such a groaning table! Such a superabundance of
solids and substantial! Was it possible that sailors fared thus?—the
sailors, who at sea live upon salt beef and biscuit?

First and foremost, was a mighty pewter dish, big as Achilles’ shield,
sustaining a pyramid of smoking sausages. This stood at one end; midway
was a similar dish, heavily laden with farmers’ slices of head-cheese;
and at the opposite end, a congregation of beef-steaks, piled tier over
tier. Scattered at intervals between, were side dishes of boiled
potatoes, eggs by the score, bread, and pickles; and on a stand
adjoining, was an ample reserve of every thing on the supper table.

We fell to with all our hearts; wrapt ourselves in hot jackets of
beef-steaks; curtailed the sausages with great celerity; and sitting
down before the head-cheese, soon razed it to its foundations.

Toward the close of the entertainment, I suggested to Peggy, one of the
girls who had waited upon us, that a cup of tea would be a nice thing
to take; and I would thank her for one. She replied that it was too
late for tea; but she would get me a cup of _“swipes”_ if I wanted it.

Not knowing what _“swipes”_ might be, I thought I would run the risk
and try it; but it proved a miserable beverage, with a musty, sour
flavor, as if it had been a decoction of spoiled pickles. I never
patronized _swipes_ again; but gave it a wide berth; though, at dinner
afterward, it was furnished to an unlimited extent, and drunk by most
of my shipmates, who pronounced it good.

But Bob Still would not have pronounced it so; for this _stripes, as I_
learned, was a sort of cheap substitute for beer; or a bastard kind of
beer; or the washings and rinsings of old beer-barrels. But I do not
remember now what they said it was, precisely. I only know, that
_swipes_ was my abomination. As for the taste of it, I can only
describe it as answering to the name itself; which is certainly
significant of something vile. But it is drunk in large quantities by
the poor people about Liverpool, which, perhaps, in some degree,
accounts for their poverty.




CHAPTER XXIX.
REDBURN DEFERENTIALLY DISCOURSES CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS OF SAILORS


The ship remained in Prince’s Dock over six weeks; but as I do not mean
to present a diary of my stay there, I shall here simply record the
general tenor of the life led by our crew during that interval; and
will then proceed to note down, at random, my own wanderings about
town, and impressions of things as they are recalled to me now, after
the lapse of so many years.

But first, I must mention that we saw little of the captain during our
stay in the dock. Sometimes, cane in hand, he sauntered down of a
pleasant morning from the _Arms Hotel_, I believe it was, where he
boarded; and after lounging about the ship, giving orders to his Prime
Minister and Grand Vizier, the chief mate, he would saunter back to his
drawing-rooms.

From the glimpse of a play-bill, which I detected peeping out of his
pocket, I inferred that he patronized the theaters; and from the flush
of his cheeks, that he patronized the fine old Port wine, for which
Liverpool is famous.

Occasionally, however, he spent his nights on board; and mad,
roystering nights they were, such as rare Ben Jonson would have
delighted in. For company over the cabin-table, he would have four or
five whiskered sea-captains, who kept the steward drawing corks and
filling glasses all the time. And once, the whole company were found
under the table at four o’clock in the morning, and were put to bed and
tucked in by the two mates. Upon this occasion, I agreed with our
woolly Doctor of Divinity, the black cook, that they should have been
ashamed of themselves; but there is no shame in some sea-captains, who
only blush after the third bottle.

During the many visits of Captain Riga to the ship, he always said
something courteous to a gentlemanly, friendless custom-house officer,
who staid on board of us nearly all the time we lay in the dock.

And weary days they must have been to this friendless custom-house
officer; trying to kill time in the cabin with a newspaper; and rapping
on the transom with his knuckles. He was kept on board to prevent
smuggling; but he used to smuggle himself ashore very often, when,
according to law, he should have been at his post on board ship. But no
wonder; he seemed to be a man of fine feelings, altogether above his
situation; a most inglorious one, indeed; worse than driving geese to
water.

And now, to proceed with the crew.

At daylight, all hands were called, and the decks were washed down;
then we had an hour to go ashore to breakfast; after which we worked at
the rigging, or picked oakum, or were set to some employment or other,
never mind how trivial, till twelve o’clock, when we went to dinner. At
half-past nine we resumed work; and finally _knocked off_ at four
o’clock in the afternoon, unless something particular was in hand. And
after four o’clock, we could go where we pleased, and were not required
to be on board again till next morning at daylight.

As we had nothing to do with the cargo, of course, our duties were
light enough; and the chief mate was often put to it to devise some
employment for us.

We had no watches to stand, a ship-keeper, hired from shore, relieving
us from that; and all the while the men’s wages ran on, as at sea.
Sundays we had to ourselves.

Thus, it will be seen, that the life led by sailors of American ships
in Liverpool, is an exceedingly easy one, and abounding in leisure.
They live ashore on the fat of the land; and after a little wholesome
exercise in the morning, have the rest of the day to themselves.

Nevertheless, these Liverpool voyages, likewise those to London and
Havre, are the least profitable that an improvident seaman can take.
Because, in New York he receives his month’s advance; in Liverpool,
another; both of which, in most cases, quickly disappear; so that by
the time his voyage terminates, he generally has but little coming to
him; sometimes not a cent. Whereas, upon a long voyage, say to India or
China, his wages accumulate; he has more inducements to economize, and
far fewer motives to extravagance; and when he is paid off at last, he
goes away jingling a quart measure of dollars.

Besides, of all sea-ports in the world, Liverpool, perhaps, most
abounds in all the variety of land-sharks, land-rats, and other vermin,
which make the hapless mariner their prey. In the shape of landlords,
bar-keepers, clothiers, crimps, and boarding-house loungers, the
land-sharks devour him, limb by limb; while the land-rats and mice
constantly nibble at his purse.

Other perils he runs, also, far worse; from the denizens of notorious
Corinthian haunts in the vicinity of the docks, which in depravity are
not to be matched by any thing this side of the pit that is bottomless.

And yet, sailors love this Liverpool; and upon long voyages to distant
parts of the globe, will be continually dilating upon its charms and
attractions, and extolling it above all other seaports in the world.
For in Liverpool they find their Paradise—not the well known street of
that name—and one of them told me he would be content to lie in
Prince’s Dock till _he hove up anchor_ for the world to come.

Much is said of ameliorating the condition of sailors; but it must ever
prove a most difficult endeavor, so long as the antidote is given
before the bane is removed.

Consider, that, with the majority of them, the very fact of their being
sailors, argues a certain recklessness and sensualism of character,
ignorance, and depravity; consider that they are generally friendless
and alone in the world; or if they have friends and relatives, they are
almost constantly beyond the reach of their good influences; consider
that after the rigorous discipline, hardships, dangers, and privations
of a voyage, they are set adrift in a foreign port, and exposed to a
thousand enticements, which, under the circumstances, would be hard
even for virtue itself to withstand, unless virtue went about on
crutches; consider that by their very vocation they are shunned by the
better classes of people, and cut off from all access to respectable
and improving society; consider all this, and the reflecting mind must
very soon perceive that the case of sailors, as a class, is not a very
promising one.

Indeed, the bad things of their condition come under the head of those
chronic evils which can only be ameliorated, it would seem, by
ameliorating the moral organization of all civilization.

Though old seventy-fours and old frigates are converted into chapels,
and launched into the docks; though the “Boatswain’s Mate” and other
clever religious tracts in the nautical dialect are distributed among
them; though clergymen harangue them from the pier-heads: and chaplains
in the navy read sermons to them on the gun-deck; though evangelical
boarding-houses are provided for them; though the parsimony of
ship-owners has seconded the really sincere and pious efforts of
Temperance Societies, to take away from seamen their old rations of
grog while at sea:—notwithstanding all these things, and many more, the
relative condition of the great bulk of sailors to the rest of mankind,
seems to remain pretty much where it was, a century ago.

It is too much the custom, perhaps, to regard as a special advance,
that unavoidable, and merely participative progress, which any one
class makes in sharing the general movement of the race. Thus, because
the sailor, who to-day steers the Hibernia or Unicorn steam-ship across
the Atlantic, is a somewhat different man from the exaggerated sailors
of Smollett, and the men who fought with Nelson at Copenhagen, and
survived to riot themselves away at North Corner in Plymouth;—because
the modem tar is not quite so gross as heretofore, and has shaken off
some of his shaggy jackets, and docked his Lord Rodney
queue:—therefore, in the estimation of some observers, he has begun to
see the evils of his condition, and has voluntarily improved. But upon
a closer scrutiny, it will be seen that he has but drifted along with
that great tide, which, perhaps, has two flows for one ebb; he has made
no individual advance of his own.

There are classes of men in the world, who bear the same relation to
society at large, that the wheels do to a coach: and are just as
indispensable. But however easy and delectable the springs upon which
the insiders pleasantly vibrate: however sumptuous the hammer-cloth,
and glossy the door-panels; yet, for all this, the wheels must still
revolve in dusty, or muddy revolutions. No contrivance, no sagacity can
lift _them_ out of the mire; for upon something the coach must be
bottomed; on something the insiders must roll.

Now, sailors form one of these wheels: they go and come round the
globe; they are the true importers, and exporters of spices and silks;
of fruits and wines and marbles; they carry missionaries, embassadors,
opera-singers, armies, merchants, tourists, and scholars to their
destination: they are a bridge of boats across the Atlantic; they are
the _primum mobile_ of all commerce; and, in short, were they to
emigrate in a body to man the navies of the moon, almost every thing
would stop here on earth except its revolution on its axis, and the
orators in the American Congress.

And yet, what are sailors? What in your heart do you think of that
fellow staggering along the dock? Do you not give him a wide berth,
shun him, and account him but little above the brutes that perish? Will
you throw open your parlors to him; invite him to dinner? or give him a
season ticket to your pew in church?—No. You will do no such thing; but
at a distance, you will perhaps subscribe a dollar or two for the
building of a hospital, to accommodate sailors already broken down; or
for the distribution of excellent books among tars who can not read.
And the very mode and manner in which such charities are made, bespeak,
more than words, the low estimation in which sailors are held. It is
useless to gainsay it; they are deemed almost the refuse and
offscourings of the earth; and the romantic view of them is principally
had through romances.

But can sailors, one of the wheels of this world, be wholly lifted up
from the mire? There seems not much chance for it, in the old systems
and programmes of the future, however well-intentioned and sincere; for
with such systems, the thought of lifting them up seems almost as
hopeless as that of growing the grape in Nova Zembla.

But we must not altogether despair for the sailor; nor need those who
toil for his good be at bottom disheartened, or Time must prove his
friend in the end; and though sometimes he would almost seem as a
neglected step-son of heaven, permitted to run on and riot out his days
with no hand to restrain him, while others are watched over and
tenderly cared for; yet we feel and we know that God is the true Father
of all, and that none of his children are without the pale of his care.




CHAPTER XXX.
REDBURN GROWS INTOLERABLY FLAT AND STUPID OVER SOME OUTLANDISH OLD
GUIDE-BOOKS


Among the odd volumes in my father’s library, was a collection of old
European and English guide-books, which he had bought on his travels, a
great many years ago. In my childhood, I went through many courses of
studying them, and never tired of gazing at the numerous quaint
embellishments and plates, and staring at the strange title-pages, some
of which I thought resembled the mustached faces of foreigners. Among
others was a Parisian-looking, faded, pink-covered pamphlet, the rouge
here and there effaced upon its now thin and attenuated cheeks,
entitled, _“Voyage Descriptif et Philosophique de L’Ancien et du
Nouveau Paris: Miroir Fidèle”_ also a time-darkened, mossy old book, in
marbleized binding, much resembling verd-antique, entitled,
_“Itinéraire Instructif de Rome, ou Description Générale des Monumens
Antiques et Modernes et des Ouvrages les plus Remarquables de Peinteur,
de Sculpture, et de Architecture de cette Célébre Ville;”_ on the
russet title-page is a vignette representing a barren rock, partly
shaded by a scrub-oak (a forlorn bit of landscape), and under the lee
of the rock and the shade of the tree, maternally reclines the
houseless foster-mother of Romulus and Remus, giving suck to the
illustrious twins; a pair of naked little cherubs sprawling on the
ground, with locked arms, eagerly engaged at their absorbing
occupation; a large cactus-leaf or diaper hangs from a bough, and the
wolf looks a good deal like one of the no-horn breed of barn-yard cows;
the work is published _“Avec privilege du Souverain Pontife.”_ There
was also a velvet-bound old volume, in brass clasps, entitled, _“The
Conductor through Holland”_ with a plate of the Stadt House; also a
venerable _“Picture of London”_ abounding in representations of St.
Paul’s, the Monument, Temple-Bar, Hyde-Park-Corner, the Horse Guards,
the Admiralty, Charing-Cross, and Vauxhall Bridge. Also, a bulky book,
in a dusty-looking yellow cover, reminding one of the paneled doors of
a mail-coach, and bearing an elaborate title-page, full of printer’s
flourishes, in emulation of the cracks of a four-in-hand whip,
entitled, in part, _“The Great Roads, both direct and cross, throughout
England and Wales, from an actual Admeasurement by order of His
Majesty’s Postmaster-General: This work describes the Cities, Market
and Borough and Corporate Towns, and those at which the Assizes are
held, and gives the time of the Mails’ arrival and departure from each:
Describes the Inns in the Metropolis from which the stages go, and the
Inns in the country which supply post-horses and carriages: Describes
the Noblemen and Gentlemen’s Seats situated near the Road, with Maps of
the Environs of London, Bath, Brighton, and Margate.”_ It is dedicated
_“To the Right Honorable the Earls of Chesterfield and Leicester, by
their Lordships’ Most Obliged, Obedient, and Obsequious Servant, John
Gary,_ 1798.” Also a green pamphlet, with a motto from Virgil, and an
intricate coat of arms on the cover, looking like a diagram of the
Labyrinth of Crete, entitled, “A _Description of York, its Antiquities
and Public Buildings, particularly the Cathedral; compiled with great
pains from the most authentic records.”_ Also a small
scholastic-looking volume, in a classic vellum binding, and with a
frontispiece bringing together at one view the towers and turrets of
King’s College and the magnificent Cathedral of Ely, though
geographically sixteen miles apart, entitled, _“The Cambridge Guide:
its Colleges, Halls, Libraries, and Museums, with the Ceremonies of the
Town and University, and some account of Ely Cathedral.”_ Also a
pamphlet, with a japanned sort of cover, stamped with a disorderly
higgledy-piggledy group of pagoda-looking structures, claiming to be an
accurate representation of the _“North or Grand Front of Blenheim,”_
and entitled, “A _Description of Blenheim, the Seat of His Grace the
Duke of Marlborough; containing a full account of the Paintings,
Tapestry, and Furniture: a Picturesque Tour of the Gardens and Parks,
and a General Description of the famous China Gallery,_ &.; _with an
Essay on Landscape Gardening: and embellished with a View of the
Palace, and a New and Elegant Plan of the Great Park.”_ And lastly, and
to the purpose, there was a volume called “THE PICTURE OF LIVERPOOL.”

It was a curious and remarkable book; and from the many fond
associations connected with it, I should like to immortalize it, if I
could.

But let me get it down from its shrine, and paint it, if I may, from
the life.

As I now linger over the volume, to and fro turning the pages so dear
to my boyhood,—the very pages which, years and years ago, my father
turned over amid the very scenes that are here described; what a soft,
pleasing sadness steals over me, and how I melt into the past and
forgotten!

Dear book! I will sell my Shakespeare, and even sacrifice my old quarto
Hogarth, before I will part with you. Yes, I will go to the hammer
myself, ere I send you to be knocked down in the auctioneer’s shambles.
I will, my beloved,—old family relic that you are;—till you drop leaf
from leaf, and letter from letter, you shall have a snug shelf
somewhere, though I have no bench for myself.

In size, it is what the booksellers call an _18mo;_ it is bound in
green morocco, which from my earliest recollection has been spotted and
tarnished with time; the corners are marked with triangular patches of
red, like little cocked hats; and some unknown Goth has inflicted an
incurable wound upon the back. There is no lettering outside; so that
he who lounges past my humble shelves, seldom dreams of opening the
anonymous little book in green. There it stands; day after day, week
after week, year after year; and no one but myself regards it. But I
make up for all neglects, with my own abounding love for it.

But let us open the volume.

What are these scrawls in the fly-leaves? what incorrigible pupil of a
writing-master has been here? what crayon sketcher of wild animals and
falling air-castles? Ah, no!—these are all part and parcel of the
precious book, which go to make up the sum of its treasure to me.

Some of the scrawls are my own; and as poets do with their juvenile
sonnets, I might write under this horse, _“Drawn at the age of three
years,”_ and under this autograph, _“Executed at the age of eight.”_

Others are the handiwork of my brothers, and sisters, and cousins; and
the hands that sketched some of them are now moldered away.

But what does this anchor here? this ship? and this sea-ditty of
Dibdin’s? The book must have fallen into the hands of some tarry
captain of a forecastle. No: that anchor, ship, and Dibdin’s ditty are
mine; this hand drew them; and on this very voyage to Liverpool. But
not so fast; I did not mean to tell that yet.

Full in the midst of these pencil scrawlings, completely surrounded
indeed, stands in indelible, though faded ink, and in my father’s
hand-writing, the following:—

WALTER REDBURN.


Riddough’s Royal Hotel,
Liverpool, March 20th, 1808.


Turning over that leaf, I come upon some half-effaced miscellaneous
memoranda in pencil, characteristic of a methodical mind, and therefore
indubitably my father’s, which he must have made at various times
during his stay in Liverpool. These are full of a strange, subdued,
old, midsummer interest to me: and though, from the numerous
effacements, it is much like cross-reading to make them out; yet, I
must here copy a few at random:—

                                      £     s.     d
_Guide-Book_                                3      6
_Dinner at the Star and Garter_                   10
_Trip to Preston (distance 31 m.)_    2     6      3
_Gratuities_                                       4
_Hack_                                      4      6
_Thompson’s Seasons_                               5
_Library_                                          1
_Boat on the river_                                6
_Port wine and cigar_                              4


And on the opposite page, I can just decipher the following:

_Dine with Mr. Roscoe on Monday._
_Call upon Mr. Morille same day._
_Leave card at Colonel Digby’s on Tuesday._
_Theatre Friday night—Richard III. and new farce._
_Present letter at Miss L——’s on Tuesday._
_Call on Sampson & Wilt, Friday._
_Get my draft on London cashed._
_Write home by the Princess._
_Letter bag at Sampson and Wilt’s._


Turning over the next leaf, I unfold a map, which in the midst of the
British Arms, in one corner displays in sturdy text, that this is _“A
Plan of the Town of Liverpool.”_ But there seems little plan in the
confined and crooked looking marks for the streets, and the docks
irregularly scattered along the bank of the Mersey, which flows along,
a peaceful stream of shaded line engraving.

On the northeast corner of the map, lies a level Sahara of yellowish
white: a desert, which still bears marks of my zeal in endeavoring to
populate it with all manner of uncouth monsters in crayons. The space
designated by that spot is now, doubtless, completely built up in
Liverpool.

Traced with a pen, I discover a number of dotted lines, radiating in
all directions from the foot of Lord-street, where stands marked
_“Riddough’s Hotel,”_ the house my father stopped at.

These marks delineate his various excursions in the town; and I follow
the lines on, through street and lane; and across broad squares; and
penetrate with them into the narrowest courts.

By these marks, I perceive that my father forgot not his religion in a
foreign land; but attended St. John’s Church near the Hay-market, and
other places of public worship: I see that he visited the News Room in
Duke-street, the Lyceum in Bold-street, and the Theater Royal; and that
he called to pay his respects to the eminent Mr. Roscoe, the historian,
poet, and banker.

Reverentially folding this map, I pass a plate of the Town Hall, and
come upon the Title Page, which, in the middle, is ornamented with a
piece of landscape, representing a loosely clad lady in sandals,
pensively seated upon a bleak rock on the sea shore, supporting her
head with one hand, and with the other, exhibiting to the stranger an
oval sort of salver, bearing the figure of a strange bird, with this
motto elastically stretched for a border—_“Deus nobis haec otia
fecit.”_

The bird forms part of the city arms, and is an imaginary
representation of a now extinct fowl, called the _“Liver,”_ said to
have inhabited a _“pool,”_ which antiquarians assert once covered a
good part of the ground where Liverpool now stands; and from that bird,
and this pool, Liverpool derives its name.

At a distance from the pensive lady in sandals, is a ship under full
sail; and on the beach is the figure of a small man, vainly essaying to
roll over a huge bale of goods.

Equally divided at the top and bottom of this design, is the following
title complete; but I fear the printer will not be able to give a
facsimile:—

_The Picture
of Liverpool:
or, Stranger’s Guide
and Gentleman’s Pocket Companion
_ FOR THE TOWN.
 Embellished
With Engravings
By the Most Accomplished and Eminent Artists.
Liverpool:
Printed in Swift’s Court,
And sold by Woodward and Alderson, 56 Castle St. 1803.



A brief and reverential preface, as if the writer were all the time
bowing, informs the reader of the flattering reception accorded to
previous editions of the work; and quotes _“testimonies of respect
which had lately appeared in various quarters_ —_the British Critic,
Review, and the seventh volume of the Beauties of England and
Wales”—_and concludes by expressing the hope, that this new, revised,
and illustrated edition might _“render it less unworthy of the public
notice, and less unworthy also of the subject it is intended to
illustrate.”_

A very nice, dapper, and respectful little preface, the time and place
of writing which is solemnly recorded at the end-Hope _Place, 1st
Sept._ 1803.

But how much fuller my satisfaction, as I fondly linger over this
circumstantial paragraph, if the writer had recorded the precise hour
of the day, and by what timepiece; and if he had but mentioned his age,
occupation, and name.

But all is now lost; I know not who he was; and this estimable author
must needs share the oblivious fate of all literary incognitos.

He must have possessed the grandest and most elevated ideas of true
fame, since he scorned to be perpetuated by a solitary initial. Could I
find him out now, sleeping neglected in some churchyard, I would buy
him a headstone, and record upon it naught but his title-page, deeming
that his noblest epitaph.

After the preface, the book opens with an extract from a prologue
written by the excellent Dr. Aiken, the brother of Mrs. Barbauld, upon
the opening of the Theater Royal, Liverpool, in 1772:—

_“Where Mersey’s stream, long winding o’er the plain,
Pours his full tribute to the circling main,
A band of fishers chose their humble seat;
Contented labor blessed the fair retreat,
Inured to hardship, patient, bold, and rude,
They braved the billows for precarious food:
Their straggling huts were ranged along the shore,
Their nets and little boats their only store.”_


Indeed, throughout, the work abounds with quaint poetical quotations,
and old-fashioned classical allusions to the Aeneid and Falconer’s
Shipwreck.

And the anonymous author must have been not only a scholar and a
gentleman, but a man of gentle disinterestedness, combined with true
city patriotism; for in his _“Survey of__ the Town”_ are nine thickly
printed pages of a neglected poem by a neglected Liverpool poet.

By way of apologizing for what might seem an obtrusion upon the public
of so long an episode, he courteously and feelingly introduces it by
saying, that _“the poem has now for several years been scarce, and is
at present but little known; and hence a very small portion of it will
no doubt be highly acceptable to the cultivated reader; especially as
this noble epic is written with great felicity of expression and the
sweetest delicacy of feeling.”_

Once, but once only, an uncharitable thought crossed my mind, that the
author of the Guide-Book might have been the author of the epic. But
that was years ago; and I have never since permitted so uncharitable a
reflection to insinuate itself into my mind.

This epic, from the specimen before me, is composed in the old stately
style, and rolls along commanding as a coach and four. It sings of
Liverpool and the Mersey; its docks, and ships, and warehouses, and
bales, and anchors; and after descanting upon the abject times, when
_“his noble waves, inglorious, Mersey rolled,”_ the poet breaks forth
like all Parnassus with:—

_“Now o’er the wondering world her name resounds,
From northern climes to India’s distant bounds—
Where’er his shores the broad Atlantic waves;
Where’er the Baltic rolls his wintry waves;
Where’er the honored flood extends his tide,
That clasps Sicilia like a favored bride.
Greenland for her its bulky whale resigns,
And temperate Gallia rears her generous vines:
’Midst warm Iberia citron orchards blow,
And the ripe fruitage bends the laboring bough;
In every clime her prosperous fleets are known,
She makes the wealth of every clime her own.”_


It also contains a delicately-curtained allusion to Mr. Roscoe:—

_“And here_ R*s*o*, _with genius all his own,
New tracks explores, and all before unknown?”_


Indeed, both the anonymous author of the Guide-Book, and the gifted
bard of the Mersey, seem to have nourished the warmest appreciation of
the fact, that to their beloved town Roscoe imparted a reputation which
gracefully embellished its notoriety as a mere place of commerce. He is
called the modern Guicciardini of the modern Florence, and his
histories, translations, and Italian Lives, are spoken of with
classical admiration.

The first chapter begins in a methodical, business-like way, by
informing the impatient reader of the precise latitude and longitude of
Liverpool; so that, at the outset, there may be no misunderstanding on
that head. It then goes on to give an account of the history and
antiquities of the town, beginning with a record in the _Doomsday-Book_
of William the Conqueror.

Here, it must be sincerely confessed, however, that notwithstanding his
numerous other merits, my favorite author betrays a want of the
uttermost antiquarian and penetrating spirit, which would have scorned
to stop in its researches at the reign of the Norman monarch, but would
have pushed on resolutely through the dark ages, up to Moses, the man
of Uz, and Adam; and finally established the fact beyond a doubt, that
the soil of Liverpool was created with the creation.

But, perhaps, one of the most curious passages in the chapter of
antiquarian research, is the pious author’s moralizing reflections upon
an interesting fact he records: to wit, that in a.d. 1571, the
inhabitants sent a memorial to Queen Elizabeth, praying relief under a
subsidy, wherein they style themselves _“her majesty’s poor decayed
town of Liverpool.”_

As I now fix my gaze upon this faded and dilapidated old guide-book,
bearing every token of the ravages of near half a century, and read how
this piece of antiquity enlarges like a modern upon previous
antiquities, I am forcibly reminded that the world is indeed growing
old. And when I turn to the second chapter, _“On the increase of the
town, and number of inhabitants,”_ and then skim over page after page
throughout the volume, all filled with allusions to the immense
grandeur of a place, which, since then, has more than quadrupled in
population, opulence, and splendor, and whose present inhabitants must
look back upon the period here spoken of with a swelling feeling of
immeasurable superiority and pride, I am filled with a comical sadness
at the vanity of all human exaltation. For the cope-stone of to-day is
the corner-stone of tomorrow; and as St. Peter’s church was built in
great part of the ruins of old Rome, so in all our erections, however
imposing, we but form quarries and supply ignoble materials for the
grander domes of posterity.

And even as this old guide-book boasts of the, to us, insignificant
Liverpool of fifty years ago, the New York guidebooks are now vaunting
of the magnitude of a town, whose future inhabitants, multitudinous as
the pebbles on the beach, and girdled in with high walls and towers,
flanking endless avenues of opulence and taste, will regard all our
Broadways and Bowerys as but the paltry nucleus to their Nineveh. From
far up the Hudson, beyond Harlem River, where the young saplings are
now growing, that will overarch their lordly mansions with broad
boughs, centuries old; they may send forth explorers to penetrate into
the then obscure and smoky alleys of the Fifth Avenue and
Fourteenth-street; and going still farther south, may exhume the
present Doric Custom-house, and quote it as a proof that their high and
mighty metropolis enjoyed a Hellenic antiquity.

As I am extremely loth to omit giving a specimen of the dignified style
of this _“Picture of Liverpool,”_ so different from the brief, pert,
and unclerkly hand-books to Niagara and Buffalo of the present day, I
shall now insert the chapter of antiquarian researches; especially as
it is entertaining in itself, and affords much valuable, and perhaps
rare information, which the reader may need, concerning the famous
town, to which I made _my first voyage._ And I think that with regard
to a matter, concerning which I myself am wholly ignorant, it is far
better to quote my old friend verbatim, than to mince his substantial
baron-of-beef of information into a flimsy ragout of my own; and so,
pass it off as original. Yes, I will render unto my honored guide-book
its due.

But how can the printer’s art so dim and mellow down the pages into a
soft sunset yellow; and to the reader’s eye, shed over the type all the
pleasant associations which the original carries to me!

No! by my father’s sacred memory, and all sacred privacies of fond
family reminiscences, I will not! I will _not_ quote thee, old Morocco,
before the cold face of the marble-hearted world; for your antiquities
would only be skipped and dishonored by shallow-minded readers; and for
me, I should be charged with swelling out my volume by plagiarizing
from a guide-book-the most vulgar and ignominious of thefts!




CHAPTER XXXI.
WITH HIS PROSY OLD GUIDE-BOOK, HE TAKES A PROSY STROLL THROUGH THE TOWN


When I left home, I took the green morocco guide-book along, supposing
that from the great number of ships going to Liverpool, I would most
probably ship on board of one of them, as the event itself proved.

Great was my boyish delight at the prospect of visiting a place, the
infallible clew to all whose intricacies I held in my hand.

On the passage out I studied its pages a good deal. In the first place,
I grounded myself thoroughly in the history and antiquities of the
town, as set forth in the chapter I intended to quote. Then I mastered
the columns of statistics, touching the advance of population; and
pored over them, as I used to do over my multiplication-table. For I
was determined to make the whole subject my own; and not be content
with a mere smattering of the thing, as is too much the custom with
most students of guide-books. Then I perused one by one the elaborate
descriptions of public edifices, and scrupulously compared the text
with the corresponding engraving, to see whether they corroborated each
other. For be it known that, including the map, there were no less than
seventeen plates in the work. And by often examining them, I had so
impressed every column and cornice in my mind, that I had no doubt of
recognizing the originals in a moment.

In short, when I considered that my own father had used this very
guide-book, and that thereby it had been thoroughly tested, and its
fidelity proved beyond a peradventure; I could not but think that I was
building myself up in an unerring knowledge of Liverpool; especially as
I had familiarized myself with the map, and could turn sharp corners on
it, with marvelous confidence and celerity.

In imagination, as I lay in my berth on ship-board, I used to take
pleasant afternoon rambles through the town; down St. James-street and
up Great George’s, stopping at various places of interest and
attraction. I began to think I had been born in Liverpool, so familiar
seemed all the features of the map. And though some of the streets
there depicted were thickly involved, endlessly angular and crooked,
like the map of Boston, in Massachusetts, yet, I made no doubt, that I
could march through them in the darkest night, and even run for the
most distant dock upon a pressing emergency.

Dear delusion!

It never occurred to my boyish thoughts, that though a guide-book,
fifty years old, might have done good service in its day, yet it would
prove but a miserable cicerone to a modern. I little imagined that the
Liverpool my father saw, was another Liverpool from that to which I,
his son Wellingborough was sailing. No; these things never obtruded; so
accustomed had I been to associate my old morocco guide-book with the
town it described, that the bare thought of there being any
discrepancy, never entered my mind.

While we lay in the Mersey, before entering the dock, I got out my
guide-book to see how the map would compare with the identical place
itself. But they bore not the slightest resemblance. However, thinks I,
this is owing to my taking a horizontal view, instead of a bird’s-eye
survey. So, never mind old guide-book, _you,_ at least, are all right.

But my faith received a severe shock that same evening, when the crew
went ashore to supper, as I have previously related.

The men stopped at a curious old tavern, near the Prince’s Dock’s
walls; and having my guide-book in my pocket, I drew it forth to
compare notes, when I found, that precisely upon the spot where I and
my shipmates were standing, and a cherry-cheeked bar-maid was filling
their glasses, my infallible old Morocco, in that very place, located a
fort; adding, that it was well worth the intelligent stranger’s while
to visit it for the purpose of beholding the guard relieved in the
evening.

This was a staggerer; for how could a tavern be mistaken for a castle?
and this was about the hour mentioned for the guard to turn out; yet
not a red coat was to be seen. But for all this, I could not, for one
small discrepancy, condemn the old family servant who had so faithfully
served my own father before me; and when I learned that this tavern
went by the name of _“The Old Fort Tavern;”_ and when I was told that
many of the old stones were yet in the walls, I almost completely
exonerated my guide-book from the half-insinuated charge of misleading
me.

The next day was Sunday, and I had it all to myself; and now, thought
I, my guide-book and I shall have a famous ramble up street and down
lane, even unto the furthest limits of this Liverpool.

I rose bright and early; from head to foot performed my ablutions “with
Eastern scrupulosity,” and I arrayed myself in my red shirt and
shooting-jacket, and the sportsman’s pantaloons; and crowned my entire
man with the tarpaulin; so that from this curious combination of
clothing, and particularly from my red shirt, I must have looked like a
very strange compound indeed: three parts sportsman, and two soldier,
to one of the sailor.

My shipmates, of course, made merry at my appearance; but I heeded them
not; and after breakfast, jumped ashore, full of brilliant
anticipations.

My gait was erect, and I was rather tall for my age; and that may have
been the reason why, as I was rapidly walking along the dock, a drunken
sailor passing, exclaimed, _“Eyes right! quick step there!”_

Another fellow stopped me to know whether I was going fox-hunting; and
one of the dock-police, stationed at the gates, after peeping out upon
me from his sentry box, a snug little den, furnished with benches and
newspapers, and hung round with storm jackets and oiled capes, issued
forth in a great hurry, crossed my path as I was emerging into the
street, and commanded me to _halt!_ I obeyed; when scanning my
appearance pertinaciously, he desired to know where I got that
tarpaulin hat, not being able to account for the phenomenon of its
roofing the head of a broken-down fox-hunter. But I pointed to my ship,
which lay at no great distance; when remarking from my voice that I was
a Yankee, this faithful functionary permitted me to pass.

It must be known that the police stationed at the gates of the docks
are extremely observant of strangers going out; as many thefts are
perpetrated on board the ships; and if they chance to see any thing
suspicious, they probe into it without mercy. Thus, the old men who buy
_“shakings,”_ and rubbish from vessels, must turn their bags wrong side
out before the police, ere they are allowed to go outside the walls.
And often they will search a suspicious looking fellow’s clothes, even
if he be a very thin man, with attenuated and almost imperceptible
pockets.

But where was I going?

I will tell. My intention was in the first place, to visit Riddough’s
Hotel, where my father had stopped, more than thirty years before: and
then, with the map in my hand, follow him through all the town,
according to the dotted lines in the diagram. For thus would I be
performing a filial pilgrimage to spots which would be hallowed in my
eyes.

At last, when I found myself going down Old Hall-street toward
Lord-street, where the hotel was situated, according to my authority;
and when, taking out my map, I found that Old Hall-street was marked
there, through its whole extent with my father’s pen; a thousand fond,
affectionate emotions rushed around my heart.

Yes, in this very street, thought I, nay, on this very flagging my
father walked. Then I almost wept, when I looked down on my sorry
apparel, and marked how the people regarded me; the men staring at so
grotesque a young stranger, and the old ladies, in beaver hats and
ruffles, crossing the walk a little to shun me.

How differently my father must have appeared; perhaps in a blue coat,
buff vest, and Hessian boots. And little did he think, that a son of
his would ever visit Liverpool as a poor friendless sailor-boy. But I
was not born then: no, when he walked this flagging, I was not so much
as thought of; I was not included in the census of the universe. My own
father did not know me then; and had never seen, or heard, or so much
as dreamed of me. And that thought had a touch of sadness to me; for if
it had certainly been, that my own parent, at one time, never cast a
thought upon me, how might it be with me hereafter? Poor, poor
Wellingborough! thought I, miserable boy! you are indeed friendless and
forlorn. Here you wander a stranger in a strange town, and the very
thought of your father’s having been here before you, but carries with
it the reflection that, he then knew you not, nor cared for you one
whit.

But dispelling these dismal reflections as well as I could, I pushed on
my way, till I got to Chapel-street, which I crossed; and then, going
under a cloister-like arch of stone, whose gloom and narrowness
delighted me, and filled my Yankee soul with romantic thoughts of old
Abbeys and Minsters, I emerged into the fine quadrangle of the
Merchants’ Exchange.

There, leaning against the colonnade, I took out my map, and traced my
father right across Chapel-street, and actually through the very arch
at my back, into the paved square where I stood.

So vivid was now the impression of his having been here, and so narrow
the passage from which he had emerged, that I felt like running on, and
overtaking him around the Town Hall adjoining, at the head of
Castle-street. But I soon checked myself, when remembering that he had
gone whither no son’s search could find him in this world. And then I
thought of all that must have happened to him since he paced through
that arch. What trials and troubles he had encountered; how he had been
shaken by many storms of adversity, and at last died a bankrupt. I
looked at my own sorry garb, and had much ado to keep from tears.

But I rallied, and gazed round at the sculptured stonework, and turned
to my guide-book, and looked at the print of the spot. It was correct
to a pillar; but wanted the central ornament of the quadrangle. This,
however, was but a slight subsequent erection, which ought not to
militate against the general character of my friend for
comprehensiveness.

The ornament in question is a group of statuary in bronze, elevated
upon a marble pedestal and basement, representing Lord Nelson expiring
in the arms of Victory. One foot rests on a rolling foe, and the other
on a cannon. Victory is dropping a wreath on the dying admiral’s brow;
while Death, under the similitude of a hideous skeleton, is insinuating
his bony hand under the hero’s robe, and groping after his heart. A
very striking design, and true to the imagination; I never could look
at Death without a shudder.

At uniform intervals round the base of the pedestal, four naked figures
in chains, somewhat larger than life, are seated in various attitudes
of humiliation and despair. One has his leg recklessly thrown over his
knee, and his head bowed over, as if he had given up all hope of ever
feeling better. Another has his head buried in despondency, and no
doubt looks mournfully out of his eyes, but as his face was averted at
the time, I could not catch the expression. These woe-begone figures of
captives are emblematic of Nelson’s principal victories; but I never
could look at their swarthy limbs and manacles, without being
involuntarily reminded of four African slaves in the market-place.

And my thoughts would revert to Virginia and Carolina; and also to the
historical fact, that the African slave-trade once constituted the
principal commerce of Liverpool; and that the prosperity of the town
was once supposed to have been indissolubly linked to its prosecution.
And I remembered that my father had often spoken to gentlemen visiting
our house in New York, of the unhappiness that the discussion of the
abolition of this trade had occasioned in Liverpool; that the struggle
between sordid interest and humanity had made sad havoc at the
fire-sides of the merchants; estranged sons from sires; and even
separated husband from wife. And my thoughts reverted to my father’s
friend, the good and great Roscoe, the intrepid enemy of the trade; who
in every way exerted his fine talents toward its suppression; writing a
poem _(“the Wrongs of Africa”),_ several pamphlets; and in his place in
Parliament, he delivered a speech against it, which, as coming from a
member for Liverpool, was supposed to have turned many votes, and had
no small share in the triumph of sound policy and humanity that ensued.

How this group of statuary affected me, may be inferred from the fact,
that I never went through Chapel-street without going through the
little arch to look at it again. And there, night or day, I was sure to
find Lord Nelson still falling back; Victory’s wreath still hovering
over his swordpoint; and Death grim and grasping as ever; while the
four bronze captives still lamented their captivity.

Now, as I lingered about the railing of the statuary, on the Sunday I
have mentioned, I noticed several persons going in and out of an
apartment, opening from the basement under the colonnade; and,
advancing, I perceived that this was a news-room, full of files of
papers. My love of literature prompted me to open the door and step in;
but a glance at my soiled shooting-jacket prompted a dignified looking
personage to step up and shut the door in my face. I deliberated a
minute what I should do to him; and at last resolutely determined to
let him alone, and pass on; which I did; going down Castle-street (so
called from a castle which once stood there, said my guide-book), and
turning down into Lord.

Arrived at the foot of the latter street, I in vain looked round for
the hotel. How serious a disappointment was this may well be imagined,
when it is considered that I was all eagerness to behold the very house
at which my father stopped; where he slept and dined, smoked his cigar,
opened his letters, and read the papers. I inquired of some gentlemen
and ladies where the missing hotel was; but they only stared and passed
on; until I met a mechanic, apparently, who very civilly stopped to
hear my questions and give me an answer.

“Riddough’s Hotel?” said he, “upon my word, I think I have heard of
such a place; let me see—yes, yes—that was the hotel where my father
broke his arm, helping to pull down the walls. My lad, you surely can’t
be inquiring for Riddough’s Hotel! What do you want to find there?”

“Oh! nothing,” I replied, “I am much obliged for your information”—and
away I walked.

Then, indeed, a new light broke in upon me concerning my guide-book;
and all my previous dim suspicions were almost confirmed. It was nearly
half a century behind the age! and no more fit to guide me about the
town, than the map of Pompeii.

It was a sad, a solemn, and a most melancholy thought. The book on
which I had so much relied; the book in the old morocco cover; the book
with the cocked-hat corners; the book full of fine old family
associations; the book with seventeen plates, executed in the highest
style of art; this precious book was next to useless. Yes, the thing
that had guided the father, could not guide the son. And I sat down on
a shop step, and gave loose to meditation.

Here, now, oh, Wellingborough, thought I, learn a lesson, and never
forget it. This world, my boy, is a moving world; its Riddough’s Hotels
are forever being pulled down; it never stands still; and its sands are
forever shifting. This very harbor of Liverpool is gradually filling
up, they say; and who knows what your son (if you ever have one) may
behold, when he comes to visit Liverpool, as long after you as you come
after his grandfather. And, Wellingborough, as your father’s guidebook
is no guide for you, neither would yours (could you afford to buy a
modern one to-day) be a true guide to those who come after you.
Guide-books, Wellingborough, are the least reliable books in all
literature; and nearly all literature, in one sense, is made up of
guide-books. Old ones tell us the ways our fathers went, through the
thoroughfares and courts of old; but how few of those former places can
their posterity trace, amid avenues of modem erections; to how few is
the old guide-book now a clew! Every age makes its own guidebooks, and
the old ones are used for waste paper. But there is one Holy
Guide-Book, Wellingborough, that will never lead you astray, if you but
follow it aright; and some noble monuments that remain, though the
pyramids crumble.

But though I rose from the door-step a sadder and a wiser boy, and
though my guide-book had been stripped of its reputation for
infallibility, I did not treat with contumely or disdain, those sacred
pages which had once been a beacon to my sire.

No.—Poor old guide-book, thought I, tenderly stroking its back, and
smoothing the dog-ears with reverence; I will not use you with despite,
old Morocco! and you will yet prove a trusty conductor through many old
streets in the old parts of this town; even if you are at fault, now
and then, concerning a Riddough’s Hotel, or some other forgotten thing
of the past. As I fondly glanced over the leaves, like one who loves
more than he chides, my eye lighted upon a passage concerning _“The Old
Dock,”_ which much aroused my curiosity. I determined to see the place
without delay: and walking on, in what I presumed to be the right
direction, at last found myself before a spacious and splendid pile of
sculptured brown stone; and entering the porch, perceived from
incontrovertible tokens that it must be the Custom-house. After
admiring it awhile, I took out my guide-book again; and what was my
amazement at discovering that, according to its authority, I was
entirely mistaken with regard to this Custom-house; for precisely where
I stood, _“The Old Dock”_ must be standing, and reading on concerning
it, I met with this very apposite passage:—_“The first idea that
strikes the stranger in coming to this dock, is the singularity of so
great a number of ships afloat in the very heart of the town, without
discovering any connection with the sea.”_

Here, now, was a poser! Old Morocco confessed that there was a good
deal of “singularity” about the thing; nor did he pretend to deny that
it was, without question, amazing, that this fabulous dock should seem
to have no _connection with the sea!_ However, the same author went on
to say, that the _“astonished stranger must suspend his wonder for
awhile, and turn to the left.”_ But, right or left, no place answering
to the description was to be seen.

This was too confounding altogether, and not to be easily accounted
for, even by making ordinary allowances for the growth and general
improvement of the town in the course of years. So, guide-book in hand,
I accosted a policeman standing by, and begged him to tell me whether
he was acquainted with any place in that neighborhood called the _“Old
Dock.”_ The man looked at me wonderingly at first, and then seeing I
was apparently sane, and quite civil into the bargain, he whipped his
well-polished boot with his rattan, pulled up his silver-laced
coat-collar, and initiated me into a knowledge of the following facts.

It seems that in this place originally stood the _“pool,”_ from which
the town borrows a part of its name, and which originally wound round
the greater part of the old settlements; that this pool was made into
the “Old Dock,” for the benefit of the shipping; but that, years ago,
it had been filled up, and furnished the site for the Custom-house
before me.

I now eyed the spot with a feeling somewhat akin to the Eastern
traveler standing on the brink of the Dead Sea. For here the doom of
Gomorrah seemed reversed, and a lake had been converted into
substantial stone and mortar.

Well, well, Wellingborough, thought I, you had better put the book into
your pocket, and carry it home to the Society of Antiquaries; it is
several thousand leagues and odd furlongs behind the march of
improvement. Smell its old morocco binding, Wellingborough; does it not
smell somewhat mummy-ish? Does it not remind you of Cheops and the
Catacombs? I tell you it was written before the lost books of Livy, and
is cousin-german to that irrecoverably departed volume, entitled, _“The
Wars of the Lord”_ quoted by Moses in the Pentateuch. Put it up,
Wellingborough, put it up, my dear friend; and hereafter follow your
nose throughout Liverpool; it will stick to you through thick and thin:
and be your ship’s mainmast and St. George’s spire your landmarks.

No!—And again I rubbed its back softly, and gently adjusted a loose
leaf: No, no, I’ll not give you up yet. Forth, old Morocco! and lead me
in sight of the venerable Abbey of Birkenhead; and let these eager eyes
behold the mansion once occupied by the old earls of Derby!

For the book discoursed of both places, and told how the Abbey was on
the Cheshire shore, full in view from a point on the Lancashire side,
covered over with ivy, and brilliant with moss! And how the house of
the noble Derby’s was now a common jail of the town; and how that
circumstance was full of suggestions, and pregnant with wisdom!

But, alas! I never saw the Abbey; at least none was in sight from the
water: and as for the house of the earls, I never saw that.

Ah me, and ten times alas! am I to visit old England in vain? in the
land of Thomas-a-Becket and stout John of Gaunt, not to catch the least
glimpse of priory or castle? Is there nothing in all the British empire
but these smoky ranges of old shops and warehouses? is Liverpool but a
brick-kiln? Why, no buildings here look so ancient as the old
gable-pointed mansion of my maternal grandfather at home, whose bricks
were brought from Holland long before the revolutionary war! Tis a
deceit—a gull—a sham—a hoax! This boasted England is no older than the
State of New York: if it is, show me the proofs—point out the vouchers.
Where’s the tower of Julius Caesar? Where’s the Roman wall? Show me
Stonehenge!

But, Wellingborough, I remonstrated with myself, you are only in
Liverpool; the old monuments lie to the north, south, east, and west of
you; you are but a sailor-boy, and you can not expect to be a great
tourist, and visit the antiquities, in that preposterous
shooting-jacket of yours. Indeed, you can not, my boy.

True, true—that’s it. I am not the traveler my father was. I am only a
common-carrier across the Atlantic.

After a weary day’s walk, I at last arrived at the sign of the
Baltimore Clipper to supper; and Handsome Mary poured me out a brimmer
of tea, in which, for the time, I drowned all my melancholy.




CHAPTER XXXII.
THE DOCKS


For more than six weeks, the ship Highlander lay in Prince’s Dock; and
during that time, besides making observations upon things immediately
around me, I made sundry excursions to the neighboring docks, for I
never tired of admiring them.

Previous to this, having only seen the miserable wooden wharves, and
slip-shod, shambling piers of New York, the sight of these mighty docks
filled my young mind with wonder and delight. In New York, to be sure,
I could not but be struck with the long line of shipping, and tangled
thicket of masts along the East River; yet, my admiration had been much
abated by those irregular, unsightly wharves, which, I am sure, are a
reproach and disgrace to the city that tolerates them.

Whereas, in Liverpool, I beheld long China walls of masonry; vast piers
of stone; and a succession of granite-rimmed docks, completely
inclosed, and many of them communicating, which almost recalled to mind
the great American chain of lakes: Ontario, Erie, St. Clair, Huron,
Michigan, and Superior. The extent and solidity of these structures,
seemed equal to what I had read of the old Pyramids of Egypt.

Liverpool may justly claim to have originated the model of the “Wet
Dock,”[1] so called, of the present day; and every thing that is
connected with its design, construction, regulation, and improvement.
Even London was induced to copy after Liverpool, and Havre followed her
example. In magnitude, cost, and durability, the docks of Liverpool,
even at the present day surpass all others in the world.

 [1] This term—_Wet Dock_—did not originate, (as has been erroneously
 opined by the otherwise learned Bardoldi); from the fact, that persons
 falling into one, never escaped without a soaking; but it is simply
 used, in order to distinguish these docks from the _Dry-Dock_, where
 the bottoms of ships are repaired.


The first dock built by the town was the _“Old Dock,”_ alluded to in my
Sunday stroll with my guide-book. This was erected in 1710, since which
period has gradually arisen that long line of dock-masonry, now
flanking the Liverpool side of the Mersey.

For miles you may walk along that river-side, passing dock after dock,
like a chain of immense fortresses:—Prince’s, George’s, Salt-House,
Clarence, Brunswick, Trafalgar, King’s, Queen’s, and many more.

In a spirit of patriotic gratitude to those naval heroes, who by their
valor did so much to protect the commerce of Britain, in which
Liverpool held so large a stake; the town, long since, bestowed upon
its more modern streets, certain illustrious names, that Broadway might
be proud of:—Duncan, Nelson, Rodney, St. Vincent, Nile.

But it is a pity, I think, that they had not bestowed these noble names
upon their noble docks; so that they might have been as a rank and file
of most fit monuments to perpetuate the names of the heroes, in
connection with the commerce they defended.

And how much better would such stirring monuments be; full of life and
commotion; than hermit obelisks of Luxor, and idle towers of stone;
which, useless to the world in themselves, vainly hope to eternize a
name, by having it carved, solitary and alone, in their granite. Such
monuments are cenotaphs indeed; founded far away from the true body of
the fame of the hero; who, if he be truly a hero, must still be linked
with the living interests of his race; for the true fame is something
free, easy, social, and companionable. They are but tomb-stones, that
commemorate his death, but celebrate not his life. It is well enough
that over the inglorious and thrice miserable grave of a Dives, some
vast marble column should be reared, recording the fact of his having
lived and died; for such records are indispensable to preserve his
shrunken memory among men; though that memory must soon crumble away
with the marble, and mix with the stagnant oblivion of the mob. But to
build such a pompous vanity over the remains of a hero, is a slur upon
his fame, and an insult to his ghost. And more enduring monuments are
built in the closet with the letters of the alphabet, than even Cheops
himself could have founded, with all Egypt and Nubia for his quarry.

Among the few docks mentioned above, occur the names of the _King’s_
and _Queens._ At the time, they often reminded me of the two principal
streets in the village I came from in America, which streets once
rejoiced in the same royal appellations. But they had been christened
previous to the Declaration of Independence; and some years after, in a
fever of freedom, they were abolished, at an enthusiastic town-meeting,
where King George and his lady were solemnly declared unworthy of being
immortalized by the village of L—. A country antiquary once told me,
that a committee of two barbers were deputed to write and inform the
distracted old gentleman of the fact.

As the description of any one of these Liverpool docks will pretty much
answer for all, I will here endeavor to give some account of Prince’s
Dock, where the Highlander rested after her passage across the
Atlantic.

This dock, of comparatively recent construction, is perhaps the largest
of all, and is well known to American sailors, from the fact, that it
is mostly frequented by the American shipping. Here lie the noble New
York packets, which at home are found at the foot of Wall-street; and
here lie the Mobile and Savannah cotton ships and traders.

This dock was built like the others, mostly upon the bed of the river,
the earth and rock having been laboriously scooped out, and solidified
again as materials for the quays and piers. From the river, Prince’s
Dock is protected by a long pier of masonry, surmounted by a massive
wall; and on the side next the town, it is bounded by similar walls,
one of which runs along a thoroughfare. The whole space thus inclosed
forms an oblong, and may, at a guess, be presumed to comprise about
fifteen or twenty acres; but as I had not the rod of a surveyor when I
took it in, I will not be certain.

The area of the dock itself, exclusive of the inclosed quays
surrounding it, may be estimated at, say, ten acres. Access to the
interior from the streets is had through several gateways; so that,
upon their being closed, the whole dock is shut up like a house. From
the river, the entrance is through a water-gate, and ingress to ships
is only to be had, when the level of the dock coincides with that of
the river; that is, about the time of high tide, as the level of the
dock is always at that mark. So that when it is low tide in the river,
the keels of the ships inclosed by the quays are elevated more than
twenty feet above those of the vessels in the stream. This, of course,
produces a striking effect to a stranger, to see hundreds of immense
ships floating high aloft in the heart of a mass of masonry.

Prince’s Dock is generally so filled with shipping, that the entrance
of a new-comer is apt to occasion a universal stir among all the older
occupants. The dock-masters, whose authority is declared by tin signs
worn conspicuously over their hats, mount the poops and forecastles of
the various vessels, and hail the surrounding strangers in all
directions:— _“Highlander ahoy! Cast off your bowline, and sheer
alongside the Neptune!”—“Neptune ahoy! get out a stern-line, and sheer
alongside the Trident!”—“Trident ahoy! get out a bowline, and drop
astern of the Undaunted!”_ And so it runs round like a shock of
electricity; touch one, and you touch all. This kind of work irritates
and exasperates the sailors to the last degree; but it is only one of
the unavoidable inconveniences of inclosed docks, which are outweighed
by innumerable advantages.

Just without the water-gate, is a basin, always connecting with the
open river, through a narrow entrance between pierheads. This basin
forms a sort of ante-chamber to the dock itself, where vessels lie
waiting their turn to enter. During a storm, the necessity of this
basin is obvious; for it would be impossible to _“dock”_ a ship under
full headway from a voyage across the ocean. From the turbulent waves,
she first glides into the ante-chamber between the pier-heads and from
thence into the docks.

Concerning the cost of the docks, I can only state, that the _King’s
Dock,_ comprehending but a comparatively small area, was completed at
an expense of some £20,000.

Our old ship-keeper, a Liverpool man by birth, who had long followed
the seas, related a curious story concerning this dock. One of the
ships which carried over troops from England to Ireland in King
William’s war, in 1688, entered the King’s Dock on the first day of its
being opened in 1788, after an interval of just one century. She was a
dark little brig, called the _Port-a-Ferry._ And probably, as her
timbers must have been frequently renewed in the course of a hundred
years, the name alone could have been all that was left of her at the
time. A paved area, very wide, is included within the walls; and along
the edge of the quays are ranges of iron sheds, intended as a temporary
shelter for the goods unladed from the shipping. Nothing can exceed the
bustle and activity displayed along these quays during the day; bales,
crates, boxes, and cases are being tumbled about by thousands of
laborers; trucks are coming and going; dock-masters are shouting;
sailors of all nations are singing out at their ropes; and all this
commotion is greatly increased by the resoundings from the lofty walls
that hem in the din.




CHAPTER XXXIII.
THE SALT-DROGHERS, AND GERMAN EMIGRANT SHIPS


Surrounded by its broad belt of masonry, each Liverpool dock is a
walled town, full of life and commotion; or rather, it is a small
archipelago, an epitome of the world, where all the nations of
Christendom, and even those of Heathendom, are represented. For, in
itself, each ship is an island, a floating colony of the tribe to which
it belongs.

Here are brought together the remotest limits of the earth; and in the
collective spars and timbers of these ships, all the forests of the
globe are represented, as in a grand parliament of masts. Canada and
New Zealand send their pines; America her live oak; India her teak;
Norway her spruce; and the Right Honorable Mahogany, member for
Honduras and Campeachy, is seen at his post by the wheel. Here, under
the beneficent sway of the Genius of Commerce, all climes and countries
embrace; and yard-arm touches yard-arm in brotherly love.

A Liverpool dock is a grand caravansary inn, and hotel, on the spacious
and liberal plan of the _Astor House._ Here ships are lodged at a
moderate charge, and payment is not demanded till the time of
departure. Here they are comfortably housed and provided for; sheltered
from all weathers and secured from all calamities. For I can hardly
credit a story I have heard, that sometimes, in heavy gales, ships
lying in the very middle of the docks have lost their
top-gallant-masts. Whatever the toils and hardships encountered on the
voyage, whether they come from Iceland or the coast of New Guinea, here
their sufferings are ended, and they take their ease in their watery
inn.

I know not how many hours I spent in gazing at the shipping in Prince’s
Dock, and speculating concerning their past voyages and future
prospects in life. Some had just arrived from the most distant ports,
worn, battered, and disabled; others were all a-taunt-o—spruce, gay,
and brilliant, in readiness for sea.

Every day the Highlander had some new neighbor. A black brig from
Glasgow, with its crew of sober Scotch caps, and its staid,
thrifty-looking skipper, would be replaced by a jovial French
hermaphrodite, its forecastle echoing with songs, and its quarter-deck
elastic from much dancing.

On the other side, perhaps, a magnificent New York Liner, huge as a
seventy-four, and suggesting the idea of a Mivart’s or Delmonico’s
afloat, would give way to a Sidney emigrant ship, receiving on board
its live freight of shepherds from the Grampians, ere long to be
tending their flocks on the hills and downs of New Holland.

I was particularly pleased and tickled, with a multitude of little
salt-droghers, rigged like sloops, and not much bigger than a
pilot-boat, but with broad bows painted black, and carrying red sails,
which looked as if they had been pickled and stained in a tan-yard.
These little fellows were continually coming in with their cargoes for
ships bound to America; and lying, five or six together, alongside of
those lofty Yankee hulls, resembled a parcel of red ants about the
carcass of a black buffalo.

When loaded, these comical little craft are about level with the water;
and frequently, when blowing fresh in the river, I have seen them
flying through the foam with nothing visible but the mast and sail, and
a man at the tiller; their entire cargo being snugly secured under
hatches.

It was diverting to observe the self-importance of the skipper of any
of these diminutive vessels. He would give himself all the airs of an
admiral on a three-decker’s poop; and no doubt, thought quite as much
of himself. And why not? What could Caesar want more? Though his craft
was none of the largest, it was subject to _him;_ and though his crew
might only consist of himself; yet if he governed it well, he achieved
a triumph, which the moralists of all ages have set above the victories
of Alexander.

These craft have each a little cabin, the prettiest, charmingest, most
delightful little dog-hole in the world; not much bigger than an
old-fashioned alcove for a bed. It is lighted by little round glasses
placed in the deck; so that to the insider, the ceiling is like a small
firmament twinkling with astral radiations. For tall men, nevertheless,
the place is but ill-adapted; a sitting, or recumbent position being
indispensable to an occupancy of the premises. Yet small, low, and
narrow as the cabin is, somehow, it affords accommodations to the
skipper and his family. Often, I used to watch the tidy good-wife,
seated at the open little scuttle, like a woman at a cottage door,
engaged in knitting socks for her husband; or perhaps, cutting his
hair, as he kneeled before her. And once, while marveling how a couple
like this found room to turn in, below, I was amazed by a noisy
irruption of cherry-cheeked young tars from the scuttle, whence they
came rolling forth, like so many curly spaniels from a kennel.

Upon one occasion, I had the curiosity to go on board a salt-drogher,
and fall into conversation with its skipper, a bachelor, who kept house
all alone. I found him a very sociable, comfortable old fellow, who had
an eye to having things cozy around him. It was in the evening; and he
invited me down into his sanctum to supper; and there we sat together
like a couple in a box at an oyster-cellar.

“He, he,” he chuckled, kneeling down before a fat, moist, little cask
of beer, and holding a cocked-hat pitcher to the faucet—“You see, Jack,
I keep every thing down here; and nice times I have by myself. Just
before going to bed, it ain’t bad to take a nightcap, you know; eh!
Jack?—here now, smack your lips over that, my boy—have a pipe?—but
stop, let’s to supper first.”

So he went to a little locker, a fixture against the side, and groping
in it awhile, and addressing it with—_“What cheer here, what cheer?”_
at last produced a loaf, a small cheese, a bit of ham, and a jar of
butter. And then placing a board on his lap, spread the table, the
pitcher of beer in the center. “Why that’s but a two legged table,”
said I, “let’s make it four.”

So we divided the burthen, and supped merrily together on our knees.

He was an old ruby of a fellow, his cheeks toasted brown; and it did my
soul good, to see the froth of the beer bubbling at his mouth, and
sparkling on his nut-brown beard. He looked so like a great mug of ale,
that I almost felt like taking him by the neck and pouring him out.

“Now Jack,” said he, when supper was over, “now Jack, my boy, do you
smoke?—Well then, load away.” And he handed me a seal-skin pouch of
tobacco and a pipe. We sat smoking together in this little sea-cabinet
of his, till it began to look much like a state-room in Tophet; and
notwithstanding my host’s rubicund nose, I could hardly see him for the
fog.

“He, he, my boy,” then said he—“I don’t never have any bugs here, I
tell ye: I smokes ’em all out every night before going to bed.”

“And where may you sleep?” said I, looking round, and seeing no sign of
a bed.

“Sleep?” says he, “why I sleep in my jacket, that’s the best
counterpane; and I use my head for a pillow. He-he, funny, ain’t it?”

“Very funny,” says I.

“Have some more ale?” says he; “plenty more.” “No more, thank you,”
says I; “I guess I’ll go;” for what with the tobacco-smoke and the ale,
I began to feel like breathing fresh air. Besides, my conscience smote
me for thus freely indulging in the pleasures of the table.

“Now, don’t go,” said he; “don’t go, my boy; don’t go out into the
damp; take an old Christian’s advice,” laying his hand on my shoulder;
“it won’t do. You see, by going out now, you’ll shake off the ale, and
get broad awake again; but if you stay here, you’ll soon be dropping
off for a nice little nap.”

But notwithstanding these inducements, I shook my host’s hand and
departed. There was hardly any thing I witnessed in the docks that
interested me more than the German emigrants who come on board the
large New York ships several days before their sailing, to make every
thing comfortable ere starting. Old men, tottering with age, and little
infants in arms; laughing girls in bright-buttoned bodices, and astute,
middle-aged men with pictured pipes in their mouths, would be seen
mingling together in crowds of five, six, and seven or eight hundred in
one ship.

Every evening these countrymen of Luther and Melancthon gathered on the
forecastle to sing and pray. And it was exalting to listen to their
fine ringing anthems, reverberating among the crowded shipping, and
rebounding from the lofty walls of the docks. Shut your eyes, and you
would think you were in a cathedral.

They keep up this custom at sea; and every night, in the dog-watch,
sing the songs of Zion to the roll of the great ocean-organ: a pious
custom of a devout race, who thus send over their hallelujahs before
them, as they hie to the land of the stranger.

And among these sober Germans, my country counts the most orderly and
valuable of her foreign population. It is they who have swelled the
census of her Northwestern States; and transferring their ploughs from
the hills of Transylvania to the prairies of Wisconsin; and sowing the
wheat of the Rhine on the banks of the Ohio, raise the grain, that, a
hundred fold increased, may return to their kinsmen in Europe.

There is something in the contemplation of the mode in which America
has been settled, that, in a noble breast, should forever extinguish
the prejudices of national dislikes. Settled by the people of all
nations, all nations may claim her for their own. You can not spill a
drop of American blood without spilling the blood of the whole world.
Be he Englishman, Frenchman, German, Dane, or Scot; the European who
scoffs at an American, calls his own brother _Raca,_ and stands in
danger of the judgment. We are not a narrow tribe of men, with a
bigoted Hebrew nationality—whose blood has been debased in the attempt
to ennoble it, by maintaining an exclusive succession among ourselves.
No: our blood is as the flood of the Amazon, made up of a thousand
noble currents all pouring into one. We are not a nation, so much as a
world; for unless we may claim all the world for our sire, like
Melchisedec, we are without father or mother.

For who was our father and our mother? Or can we point to any Romulus
and Remus for our founders? Our ancestry is lost in the universal
paternity; and Caesar and Alfred, St. Paul and Luther, and Homer and
Shakespeare are as much ours as Washington, who is as much the world’s
as our own. We are the heirs of all time, and with all nations we
divide our inheritance. On this Western Hemisphere all tribes and
people are forming into one federated whole; and there is a future
which shall see the estranged children of Adam restored as to the old
hearthstone in Eden.

The other world beyond this, which was longed for by the devout before
Columbus’ time, was found in the New; and the deep-sea-lead, that first
struck these soundings, brought up the soil of Earth’s Paradise. Not a
Paradise then, or now; but to be made so, at God’s good pleasure, and
in the fullness and mellowness of time. The seed is sown, and the
harvest must come; and our children’s children, on the world’s jubilee
morning, shall all go with their sickles to the reaping. Then shall the
curse of Babel be revoked, a new Pentecost come, and the language they
shall speak shall be the language of Britain. Frenchmen, and Danes, and
Scots; and the dwellers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the
regions round about; Italians, and Indians, and Moors; there shall
appear unto them cloven tongues as of fire.




CHAPTER XXXIV.
THE IRRAWADDY


Among the various ships lying in Prince’s Dock, none interested me more
than the Irrawaddy, of Bombay, a _“country ship,”_ which is the name
bestowed by Europeans upon the large native vessels of India. Forty
years ago, these merchantmen were nearly the largest in the world; and
they still exceed the generality. They are built of the celebrated teak
wood, the oak of the East, or in Eastern phrase, _“the King of the
Oaks.”_ The Irrawaddy had just arrived from Hindostan, with a cargo of
cotton. She was manned by forty or fifty Lascars, the native seamen of
India, who seemed to be immediately governed by a countryman of theirs
of a higher caste. While his inferiors went about in strips of white
linen, this dignitary was arrayed in a red army-coat, brilliant with
gold lace, a cocked hat, and drawn sword. But the general effect was
quite spoiled by his bare feet.

In discharging the cargo, his business seemed to consist in
flagellating the crew with the flat of his saber, an exercise in which
long practice had made him exceedingly expert. The poor fellows jumped
away with the tackle-rope, elastic as cats.

One Sunday, I went aboard of the Irrawaddy, when this oriental usher
accosted me at the gangway, with his sword at my throat. I gently
pushed it aside, making a sign expressive of the pacific character of
my motives in paying a visit to the ship. Whereupon he very
considerately let me pass.

I thought I was in Pegu, so strangely woody was the smell of the
dark-colored timbers, whose odor was heightened by the rigging of
_kayar,_ or cocoa-nut fiber.

The Lascars were on the forecastle-deck. Among them were Malays,
Mahrattas, Burmese, Siamese, and Cingalese. They were seated round
“kids” full of rice, from which, according to their invariable custom,
they helped themselves with one hand, the other being reserved for
quite another purpose. They were chattering like magpies in
Hindostanee, but I found that several of them could also speak very
good English. They were a small-limbed, wiry, tawny set; and I was
informed made excellent seamen, though ill adapted to stand the
hardships of northern voyaging.

They told me that seven of their number had died on the passage from
Bombay; two or three after crossing the Tropic of Cancer, and the rest
met their fate in the Channel, where the ship had been tost about in
violent seas, attended with cold rains, peculiar to that vicinity. Two
more had been lost overboard from the flying-jib-boom.

I was condoling with a young English cabin-boy on board, upon the loss
of these poor fellows, when he said it was their own fault; they would
never wear monkey-jackets, but clung to their thin India robes, even in
the bitterest weather. He talked about them much as a farmer would
about the loss of so many sheep by the murrain.

The captain of the vessel was an Englishman, as were also the three
mates, master and boatswain. These officers lived astern in the cabin,
where every Sunday they read the Church of England’s prayers, while the
heathen at the other end of the ship were left to their false gods and
idols. And thus, with Christianity on the quarter-deck, and paganism on
the forecastle, the Irrawaddy ploughed the sea.

As if to symbolize this state of things, the _“fancy piece”_ astern
comprised, among numerous other carved decorations, a cross and a
miter; while forward, on the bows, was a sort of devil for a
figure-head—a dragon-shaped creature, with a fiery red mouth, and a
switchy-looking tail.

After her cargo was discharged, which was done “to the sound of flutes
and soft recorders”—something as work is done in the navy to the music
of the boatswain’s pipe—the Lascars were set to _“stripping the ship”_
that is, to sending down all her spars and ropes.

At this time, she lay alongside of us, and the Babel on board almost
drowned our own voices. In nothing but their girdles, the Lascars
hopped about aloft, chattering like so many monkeys; but, nevertheless,
showing much dexterity and seamanship in their manner of doing their
work.

Every Sunday, crowds of well-dressed people came down to the dock to
see this singular ship; many of them perched themselves in the shrouds
of the neighboring craft, much to the wrath of Captain Riga, who left
strict orders with our old ship-keeper, to drive all strangers out of
the Highlander’s rigging. It was amusing at these times, to watch the
old women with umbrellas, who stood on the quay staring at the Lascars,
even when they desired to be private. These inquisitive old ladies
seemed to regard the strange sailors as a species of wild animal, whom
they might gaze at with as much impunity, as at leopards in the
Zoological Gardens.

One night I was returning to the ship, when just as I was passing
through the Dock Gate, I noticed a white figure squatting against the
wall outside. It proved to be one of the Lascars who was smoking, as
the regulations of the docks prohibit his indulging this luxury on
board his vessel. Struck with the curious fashion of his pipe, and the
odor from it, I inquired what he was smoking; he replied _“Joggerry,”_
which is a species of weed, used in place of tobacco.

Finding that he spoke good English, and was quite communicative, like
most smokers, I sat down by _Dattabdool-mans, as_ he called himself,
and we fell into conversation. So instructive was his discourse, that
when we parted, I had considerably added to my stock of knowledge.
Indeed, it is a Godsend to fall in with a fellow like this. He knows
things you never dreamed of; his experiences are like a man from the
moon—wholly strange, a new revelation. If you want to learn romance, or
gain an insight into things quaint, curious, and marvelous, drop your
books of travel, and take a stroll along the docks of a great
commercial port. Ten to one, you will encounter Crusoe himself among
the crowds of mariners from all parts of the globe.

But this is no place for making mention of all the subjects upon which
I and my Lascar friend mostly discoursed; I will only try to give his
account of the _teakwood_ and _kayar rope,_ concerning which things I
was curious, and sought information.

The _“sagoon”_ as he called the tree which produces the teak, grows in
its greatest excellence among the mountains of Malabar, whence large
quantities are sent to Bombay for shipbuilding. He also spoke of
another kind of wood, the _“sissor,”_ which supplies most of the
_“shin-logs,”_ or “knees,” and crooked timbers in the _country ships._
The sagoon grows to an immense size; sometimes there is fifty feet of
trunk, three feet through, before a single bough is put forth. Its
leaves are very large; and to convey some idea of them, my Lascar
likened them to elephants’ ears. He said a purple dye was extracted
from them, for the purpose of staining cottons and silks. The wood is
specifically heavier than water; it is easily worked, and extremely
strong and durable. But its chief merit lies in resisting the action of
the salt water, and the attacks of insects; which resistance is caused
by its containing a resinous oil called _“poonja.”_

To my surprise, he informed me that the Irrawaddy was wholly built by
the native shipwrights of India, who, he modestly asserted, surpassed
the European artisans.

The rigging, also, was of native manufacture. As the _kayar,_ of which
it is composed, is now getting into use both in England and America, as
well for ropes and rigging as for mats and rugs, my Lascar friend’s
account of it, joined to my own observations, may not be uninteresting.

In India, it is prepared very much in the same way as in Polynesia. The
cocoa-nut is gathered while the husk is still green, and but partially
ripe; and this husk is removed by striking the nut forcibly, with both
hands, upon a sharp-pointed stake, planted uprightly in the ground. In
this way a boy will strip nearly fifteen hundred in a day. But the
_kayar_ is not made from the husk, as might be supposed, but from the
rind of the nut; which, after being long soaked in water, is beaten
with mallets, and rubbed together into fibers. After this being dried
in the sun, you may spin it, just like hemp, or any similar substance.
The fiber thus produced makes very strong and durable ropes, extremely
well adapted, from their lightness and durability, for the running
rigging of a ship; while the same causes, united with its great
strength and buoyancy, render it very suitable for large cables and
hawsers.

But the elasticity of the _kayar_ ill fits it for the shrouds and
standing-rigging of a ship, which require to be comparatively firm.
Hence, as the Irrawaddy’s shrouds were all of this substance, the
Lascar told me, they were continually setting up or slacking off her
standing-rigging, according as the weather was cold or warm. And the
loss of a foretopmast, between the tropics, in a squall, he attributed
to this circumstance.

After a stay of about two weeks, the Irrawaddy had her heavy Indian
spars replaced with Canadian pine, and her _kayar_ shrouds with hempen
ones. She then mustered her pagans, and hoisted sail for London.




CHAPTER XXXV.
GALLIOTS, COAST-OF-GUINEA-MAN, AND FLOATING CHAPEL


Another very curious craft often seen in the Liverpool docks, is the
Dutch galliot, an old-fashioned looking gentleman, with hollow waist,
high prow and stern, and which, seen lying among crowds of tight Yankee
traders, and pert French brigantines, always reminded me of a cocked
hat among modish beavers.

The construction of the galliot has not altered for centuries; and the
northern European nations, Danes and Dutch, still sail the salt seas in
this flat-bottomed salt-cellar of a ship; although, in addition to
these, they have vessels of a more modern kind.

They seldom paint the galliot; but scrape and varnish all its planks
and spars, so that all over it resembles the _“bright side”_ or
polished _streak,_ usually banding round an American ship.

Some of them are kept scrupulously neat and clean, and remind one of a
well-scrubbed wooden platter, or an old oak table, upon which much wax
and elbow vigor has been expended. Before the wind, they sail well; but
on a bowline, owing to their broad hulls and flat bottoms, they make
leeway at a sad rate.

Every day, some strange vessel entered Prince’s Dock; and hardly would
I gaze my fill at some outlandish craft from Surat or the Levant, ere a
still more outlandish one would absorb my attention.

Among others, I remember, was a little brig from the Coast of Guinea.
In appearance, she was the ideal of a slaver; low, black, clipper-built
about the bows, and her decks in a state of most piratical disorder.

She carried a long, rusty gun, on a swivel, amid-ships; and that gun
was a curiosity in itself. It must have been some old veteran,
condemned by the government, and sold for any thing it would fetch. It
was an antique, covered with half-effaced inscriptions, crowns,
anchors, eagles; and it had two handles near the trunnions, like those
of a tureen. The knob on the breach was fashioned into a dolphin’s
head; and by a comical conceit, the touch-hole formed the orifice of a
human ear; and a stout tympanum it must have had, to have withstood the
concussions it had heard.

The brig, heavily loaded, lay between two large ships in ballast; so
that its deck was at least twenty feet below those of its neighbors.
Thus shut in, its hatchways looked like the entrance to deep vaults or
mines; especially as her men were wheeling out of her hold some kind of
ore, which might have been gold ore, so scrupulous were they in evening
the bushel measures, in which they transferred it to the quay; and so
particular was the captain, a dark-skinned whiskerando, in a Maltese
cap and tassel, in standing over the sailors, with his pencil and
memorandum-book in hand.

The crew were a buccaneering looking set; with hairy chests, purple
shirts, and arms wildly tattooed. The mate had a wooden leg, and
hobbled about with a crooked cane like a spiral staircase. There was a
deal of swearing on board of this craft, which was rendered the more
reprehensible when she came to moor alongside the Floating Chapel.

This was the hull of an old sloop-of-war, which had been converted into
a mariner’s church. A house had been built upon it, and a steeple took
the place of a mast. There was a little balcony near the base of the
steeple, some twenty feet from the water; where, on week-days, I used
to see an old pensioner of a tar, sitting on a camp-stool, reading his
Bible. On Sundays he hoisted the Bethel flag, and like the _muezzin_ or
cryer of prayers on the top of a Turkish mosque, would call the
strolling sailors to their devotions; not officially, but on his own
account; conjuring them not to make fools of themselves, but muster
round the pulpit, as they did about the capstan on a man-of-war. This
old worthy was the sexton. I attended the chapel several times, and
found there a very orderly but small congregation. The first time I
went, the chaplain was discoursing on future punishments, and making
allusions to the Tartarean Lake; which, coupled with the pitchy smell
of the old hull, summoned up the most forcible image of the thing which
I ever experienced.

The floating chapels which are to be found in some of the docks, form
one of the means which have been tried to induce the seamen visiting
Liverpool to turn their thoughts toward serious things. But as very few
of them ever think of entering these chapels, though they might pass
them twenty times in the day, some of the clergy, of a Sunday, address
them in the open air, from the corners of the quays, or wherever they
can procure an audience.

Whenever, in my Sunday strolls, I caught sight of one of these
congregations, I always made a point of joining it; and would find
myself surrounded by a motley crowd of seamen from all quarters of the
globe, and women, and lumpers, and dock laborers of all sorts.
Frequently the clergyman would be standing upon an old cask, arrayed in
full canonicals, as a divine of the Church of England. Never have I
heard religious discourses better adapted to an audience of men, who,
like sailors, are chiefly, if not only, to be moved by the plainest of
precepts, and demonstrations of the misery of sin, as conclusive and
undeniable as those of Euclid. No mere rhetoric avails with such men;
fine periods are vanity. You can not touch them with tropes. They need
to be pressed home by plain facts.

And such was generally the mode in which they were addressed by the
clergy in question: who, taking familiar themes for their discourses,
which were leveled right at the wants of their auditors, always
succeeded in fastening their attention. In particular, the two great
vices to which sailors are most addicted, and which they practice to
the ruin of both body and soul; these things, were the most enlarged
upon. And several times on the docks, I have seen a robed clergyman
addressing a large audience of women collected from the notorious lanes
and alleys in the neighborhood.

Is not this as it ought to be? since the true calling of the reverend
clergy is like their divine Master’s;—not to bring the righteous, but
sinners to repentance. Did some of them leave the converted and
comfortable congregations, before whom they have ministered year after
year; and plunge at once, like St. Paul, into the infected centers and
hearts of vice: _then_ indeed, would they find a strong enemy to cope
with; and a victory gained over _him,_ would entitle them to a
conqueror’s wreath. Better to save one sinner from an obvious vice that
is destroying him, than to indoctrinate ten thousand saints. And as
from every corner, in Catholic towns, the shrines of Holy Mary and the
Child Jesus perpetually remind the commonest wayfarer of his heaven;
even so should Protestant pulpits be founded in the market-places, and
at street corners, where the men of God might be heard by all of His
children.




CHAPTER XXXVI.
THE OLD CHURCH OF ST. NICHOLAS, AND THE DEAD-HOUSE


The floating chapel recalls to mind the _“Old Church,”_ well known to
the seamen of many generations, who have visited Liverpool. It stands
very near the docks, a venerable mass of brown stone, and by the town’s
people is called the Church of St. Nicholas. I believe it is the best
preserved piece of antiquity in all Liverpool.

Before the town rose to any importance, it was the only place of
worship on that side of the Mersey; and under the adjoining Parish of
Walton was a _chapel-of-ease;_ though from the straight backed pews,
there could have been but little comfort taken in it.

In old times, there stood in front of the church a statue of St.
Nicholas, the patron of mariners; to which all pious sailors made
offerings, to induce his saintship to grant them short and prosperous
voyages. In the tower is a fine chime of bells; and I well remember my
delight at first hearing them on the first Sunday morning after our
arrival in the dock. It seemed to carry an admonition with it;
something like the premonition conveyed to young Whittington by Bow
Bells. _“Wellingborough! Wellingborough! you must not forget to go to
church, Wellingborough! Don’t forget, Wellingborough! Wellingborough!
don’t forget.”_

Thirty or forty years ago, these bells were rung upon the arrival of
every Liverpool ship from a foreign voyage. How forcibly does this
illustrate the increase of the commerce of the town! Were the same
custom now observed, the bells would seldom have a chance to cease.

What seemed the most remarkable about this venerable old church, and
what seemed the most barbarous, and grated upon the veneration with
which I regarded this time-hallowed structure, was the condition of the
grave-yard surrounding it. From its close vicinity to the haunts of the
swarms of laborers about the docks, it is crossed and re-crossed by
thoroughfares in all directions; and the tomb-stones, not being erect,
but horizontal (indeed, they form a complete flagging to the spot),
multitudes are constantly walking over the dead; their heels erasing
the death’s-heads and crossbones, the last mementos of the departed. At
noon, when the lumpers employed in loading and unloading the shipping,
retire for an hour to snatch a dinner, many of them resort to the
grave-yard; and seating themselves upon a tomb-stone use the adjoining
one for a table. Often, I saw men stretched out in a drunken sleep upon
these slabs; and once, removing a fellow’s arm, read the following
inscription, which, in a manner, was true to the life, if not to the
death:—

HERE LYETH YE BODY OF
TOBIAS DRINKER.


For two memorable circumstances connected with this church, I am
indebted to my excellent friend, Morocco, who tells me that in 1588 the
Earl of Derby, coming to his residence, and waiting for a passage to
the Isle of Man, the corporation erected and adorned a sumptuous stall
in the church for his reception. And moreover, that in the time of
Cromwell’s wars, when the place was taken by that mad nephew of King
Charles, Prince Rupert, he converted the old church into a military
prison and stable; when, no doubt, another _“sumptuous stall”_ was
erected for the benefit of the steed of some noble cavalry officer.

In the basement of the church is a Dead House, like the Morgue in
Paris, where the bodies of the drowned are exposed until claimed by
their friends, or till buried at the public charge.

From the multitudes employed about the shipping, this dead-house has
always more or less occupants. Whenever I passed up Chapel-street, I
used to see a crowd gazing through the grim iron grating of the door,
upon the faces of the drowned within. And once, when the door was
opened, I saw a sailor stretched out, stark and stiff, with the sleeve
of his frock rolled up, and showing his name and date of birth tattooed
upon his arm. It was a sight full of suggestions; he seemed his own
headstone.

I was told that standing rewards are offered for the recovery of
persons falling into the docks; so much, if restored to life, and a
less amount if irrecoverably drowned. Lured by this, several horrid old
men and women are constantly prying about the docks, searching after
bodies. I observed them principally early in the morning, when they
issued from their dens, on the same principle that the rag-rakers, and
rubbish-pickers in the streets, sally out bright and early; for then,
the night-harvest has ripened.

There seems to be no calamity overtaking man, that can not be rendered
merchantable. Undertakers, sextons, tomb-makers, and hearse-drivers,
get their living from the dead; and in times of plague most thrive. And
these miserable old men and women hunted after corpses to keep from
going to the church-yard themselves; for they were the most wretched of
starvelings.




CHAPTER XXXVII.
WHAT REDBURN SAW IN LAUNCELOTT’S-HEY


The dead-house reminds me of other sad things; for in the vicinity of
the docks are many very painful sights.

In going to our boarding-house, the sign of the Baltimore Clipper, I
generally passed through a narrow street called “Launcelott’s-Hey,”
lined with dingy, prison-like cotton warehouses. In this street, or
rather alley, you seldom see any one but a truck-man, or some solitary
old warehouse-keeper, haunting his smoky den like a ghost.

Once, passing through this place, I heard a feeble wail, which seemed
to come out of the earth. It was but a strip of crooked side-walk where
I stood; the dingy wall was on every side, converting the mid-day into
twilight; and not a soul was in sight. I started, and could almost have
run, when I heard that dismal sound. It seemed the low, hopeless,
endless wail of some one forever lost. At last I advanced to an opening
which communicated downward with deep tiers of cellars beneath a
crumbling old warehouse; and there, some fifteen feet below the walk,
crouching in nameless squalor, with her head bowed over, was the figure
of what had been a woman. Her blue arms folded to her livid bosom two
shrunken things like children, that leaned toward her, one on each
side. At first, I knew not whether they were alive or dead. They made
no sign; they did not move or stir; but from the vault came that
soul-sickening wail.

I made a noise with my foot, which, in the silence, echoed far and
near; but there was no response. Louder still; when one of the children
lifted its head, and cast upward a faint glance; then closed its eyes,
and lay motionless. The woman also, now gazed up, and perceived me; but
let fall her eye again. They were dumb and next to dead with want. How
they had crawled into that den, I could not tell; but there they had
crawled to die. At that moment I never thought of relieving them; for
death was so stamped in their glazed and unimploring eyes, that I
almost regarded them as already no more. I stood looking down on them,
while my whole soul swelled within me; and I asked myself, What right
had any body in the wide world to smile and be glad, when sights like
this were to be seen? It was enough to turn the heart to gall; and make
a man-hater of a Howard. For who were these ghosts that I saw? Were
they not human beings? A woman and two girls? With eyes, and lips, and
ears like any queen? with hearts which, though they did not bound with
blood, yet beat with a dull, dead ache that was their life.

At last, I walked on toward an open lot in the alley, hoping to meet
there some ragged old women, whom I had daily noticed groping amid foul
rubbish for little particles of dirty cotton, which they washed out and
sold for a trifle.

I found them; and accosting one, I asked if she knew of the persons I
had just left. She replied, that she did not; nor did she want to. I
then asked another, a miserable, toothless old woman, with a tattered
strip of coarse baling stuff round her body. Looking at me for an
instant, she resumed her raking in the rubbish, and said that she knew
who it was that I spoke of; but that she had no time to attend to
beggars and their brats. Accosting still another, who seemed to know my
errand, I asked if there was no place to which the woman could be
taken. “Yes,” she replied, “to the church-yard.” I said she was alive,
and not dead.

“Then she’ll never die,” was the rejoinder. “She’s been down there
these three days, with nothing to eat;—that I know myself.”

“She desarves it,” said an old hag, who was just placing on her crooked
shoulders her bag of pickings, and who was turning to totter off, “that
Betsy Jennings desarves it—was she ever married? tell me that.”

Leaving Launcelott’s-Hey, I turned into a more frequented street; and
soon meeting a policeman, told him of the condition of the woman and
the girls.

“It’s none of my business, Jack,” said he. “I don’t belong to that
street.”

“Who does then?”

“I don’t know. But what business is it of yours? Are you not a Yankee?”

“Yes,” said I, “but come, I will help you remove that woman, if you say
so.”

“There, now, Jack, go on board your ship and stick to it; and leave
these matters to the town.”

I accosted two more policemen, but with no better success; they would
not even go with me to the place. The truth was, it was out of the way,
in a silent, secluded spot; and the misery of the three outcasts,
hiding away in the ground, did not obtrude upon any one.

Returning to them, I again stamped to attract their attention; but this
time, none of the three looked up, or even stirred. While I yet stood
irresolute, a voice called to me from a high, iron-shuttered window in
a loft over the way; and asked what I was about. I beckoned to the man,
a sort of porter, to come down, which he did; when I pointed down into
the vault.

“Well,” said he, “what of it?”

“Can’t we get them out?” said I, “haven’t you some place in your
warehouse where you can put them? have you nothing for them to eat?”

“You’re crazy, boy,” said he; “do you suppose, that Parkins and Wood
want their warehouse turned into a hospital?”

I then went to my boarding-house, and told Handsome Mary of what I had
seen; asking her if she could not do something to get the woman and
girls removed; or if she could not do that, let me have some food for
them. But though a kind person in the main, Mary replied that she gave
away enough to beggars in her own street (which was true enough)
without looking after the whole neighborhood.

Going into the kitchen, I accosted the cook, a little shriveled-up old
Welshwoman, with a saucy tongue, whom the sailors called _Brandy-Nan;_
and begged her to give me some cold victuals, if she had nothing
better, to take to the vault. But she broke out in a storm of swearing
at the miserable occupants of the vault, and refused. I then stepped
into the room where our dinner was being spread; and waiting till the
girl had gone out, I snatched some bread and cheese from a stand, and
thrusting it into the bosom of my frock, left the house. Hurrying to
the lane, I dropped the food down into the vault. One of the girls
caught at it convulsively, but fell back, apparently fainting; the
sister pushed the other’s arm aside, and took the bread in her hand;
but with a weak uncertain grasp like an infant’s. She placed it to her
mouth; but letting it fall again, murmuring faintly something like
“water.” The woman did not stir; her head was bowed over, just as I had
first seen her.

Seeing how it was, I ran down toward the docks to a mean little sailor
tavern, and begged for a pitcher; but the cross old man who kept it
refused, unless I would pay for it. But I had no money. So as my
boarding-house was some way off, and it would be lost time to run to
the ship for my big iron pot; under the impulse of the moment, I
hurried to one of the Boodle Hydrants, which I remembered having seen
running near the scene of a still smoldering fire in an old rag house;
and taking off a new tarpaulin hat, which had been loaned me that day,
filled it with water.

With this, I returned to Launcelott’s-Hey; and with considerable
difficulty, like getting down into a well, I contrived to descend with
it into the vault; where there was hardly space enough left to let me
stand. The two girls drank out of the hat together; looking up at me
with an unalterable, idiotic expression, that almost made me faint. The
woman spoke not a word, and did not stir. While the girls were breaking
and eating the bread, I tried to lift the woman’s head; but, feeble as
she was, she seemed bent upon holding it down. Observing her arms still
clasped upon her bosom, and that something seemed hidden under the rags
there, a thought crossed my mind, which impelled me forcibly to
withdraw her hands for a moment; when I caught a glimpse of a meager
little babe—the lower part of its body thrust into an old bonnet. Its
face was dazzlingly white, even in its squalor; but the closed eyes
looked like balls of indigo. It must have been dead some hours.

The woman refusing to speak, eat, or drink, I asked one of the girls
who they were, and where they lived; but she only stared vacantly,
muttering something that could not be understood.

The air of the place was now getting too much for me; but I stood
deliberating a moment, whether it was possible for me to drag them out
of the vault. But if I did, what then? They would only perish in the
street, and here they were at least protected from the rain; and more
than that, might die in seclusion.

I crawled up into the street, and looking down upon them again, almost
repented that I had brought them any food; for it would only tend to
prolong their misery, without hope of any permanent relief: for die
they must very soon; they were too far gone for any medicine to help
them. I hardly know whether I ought to confess another thing that
occurred to me as I stood there; but it was this—I felt an almost
irresistible impulse to do them the last mercy, of in some way putting
an end to their horrible lives; and I should almost have done so, I
think, had I not been deterred by thoughts of the law. For I well knew
that the law, which would let them perish of themselves without giving
them one cup of water, would spend a thousand pounds, if necessary, in
convicting him who should so much as offer to relieve them from their
miserable existence.

The next day, and the next, I passed the vault three times, and still
met the same sight. The girls leaning up against the woman on each
side, and the woman with her arms still folding the babe, and her head
bowed. The first evening I did not see the bread that I had dropped
down in the morning; but the second evening, the bread I had dropped
that morning remained untouched. On the third morning the smell that
came from the vault was such, that I accosted the same policeman I had
accosted before, who was patrolling the same street, and told him that
the persons I had spoken to him about were dead, and he had better have
them removed. He looked as if he did not believe me, and added, that it
was not his street.

When I arrived at the docks on my way to the ship, I entered the
guard-house within the walls, and asked for one of the captains, to
whom I told the story; but, from what he said, was led to infer that
the Dock Police was distinct from that of the town, and this was not
the right place to lodge my information.

I could do no more that morning, being obliged to repair to the ship;
but at twelve o’clock, when I went to dinner, I hurried into
Launcelott’s-Hey, when I found that the vault was empty. In place of
the women and children, a heap of quick-lime was glistening.

I could not learn who had taken them away, or whither they had gone;
but my prayer was answered—they were dead, departed, and at peace.

But again I looked down into the vault, and in fancy beheld the pale,
shrunken forms still crouching there. Ah! what are our creeds, and how
do we hope to be saved? Tell me, oh Bible, that story of Lazarus again,
that I may find comfort in my heart for the poor and forlorn.
Surrounded as we are by the wants and woes of our fellowmen, and yet
given to follow our own pleasures, regardless of their pains, are we
not like people sitting up with a corpse, and making merry in the house
of the dead?




CHAPTER XXXVIII.
THE DOCK-WALL BEGGARS


I might relate other things which befell me during the six weeks and
more that I remained in Liverpool, often visiting the cellars, sinks,
and hovels of the wretched lanes and courts near the river. But to tell
of them, would only be to tell over again the story just told; so I
return to the docks.

The old women described as picking dirty fragments of cotton in the
empty lot, belong to the same class of beings who at all hours of the
day are to be seen within the dock walls, raking over and over the
heaps of rubbish carried ashore from the holds of the shipping.

As it is against the law to throw the least thing overboard, even a
rope yarn; and as this law is very different from similar laws in New
York, inasmuch as it is rigidly enforced by the dock-masters; and,
moreover, as after discharging a ship’s cargo, a great deal of dirt and
worthless dunnage remains in the hold, the amount of rubbish
accumulated in the appointed receptacles for depositing it within the
walls is extremely large, and is constantly receiving new accessions
from every vessel that unlades at the quays.

Standing over these noisome heaps, you will see scores of tattered
wretches, armed with old rakes and picking-irons, turning over the
dirt, and making as much of a rope-yarn as if it were a skein of silk.
Their findings, nevertheless, are but small; for as it is one of the
immemorial perquisites of the second mate of a merchant ship to
collect, and sell on his own account, all the condemned “old junk” of
the vessel to which he belongs, he generally takes good heed that in
the buckets of rubbish carried ashore, there shall be as few rope-yarns
as possible.

In the same way, the cook preserves all the odds and ends of pork-rinds
and beef-fat, which he sells at considerable profit; upon a six months’
voyage frequently realizing thirty or forty dollars from the sale, and
in large ships, even more than that. It may easily be imagined, then,
how desperately driven to it must these rubbish-pickers be, to ransack
heaps of refuse which have been previously gleaned.

Nor must I omit to make mention of the singular beggary practiced in
the streets frequented by sailors; and particularly to record the
remarkable army of paupers that beset the docks at particular hours of
the day.

At twelve o’clock the crews of hundreds and hundreds of ships issue in
crowds from the dock gates to go to their dinner in the town. This hour
is seized upon by multitudes of beggars to plant themselves against the
outside of the walls, while others stand upon the curbstone to excite
the charity of the seamen. The first time that I passed through this
long lane of pauperism, it seemed hard to believe that such an array of
misery could be furnished by any town in the world.

Every variety of want and suffering here met the eye, and every vice
showed here its victims. Nor were the marvelous and almost incredible
shifts and stratagems of the professional beggars, wanting to finish
this picture of all that is dishonorable to civilization and humanity.

Old women, rather mummies, drying up with slow starving and age; young
girls, incurably sick, who ought to have been in the hospital; sturdy
men, with the gallows in their eyes, and a whining lie in their mouths;
young boys, hollow-eyed and decrepit; and puny mothers, holding up puny
babes in the glare of the sun, formed the main features of the scene.

But these were diversified by instances of peculiar suffering, vice, or
art in attracting charity, which, to me at least, who had never seen
such things before, seemed to the last degree uncommon and monstrous.

I remember one cripple, a young man rather decently clad, who sat
huddled up against the wall, holding a painted board on his knees. It
was a picture intending to represent the man himself caught in the
machinery of some factory, and whirled about among spindles and cogs,
with his limbs mangled and bloody. This person said nothing, but sat
silently exhibiting his board. Next him, leaning upright against the
wall, was a tall, pallid man, with a white bandage round his brow, and
his face cadaverous as a corpse. He, too, said nothing; but with one
finger silently pointed down to the square of flagging at his feet,
which was nicely swept, and stained blue, and bore this inscription in
chalk:—

_“I have had no food for three days;
My wife and children are dying.”_


Further on lay a man with one sleeve of his ragged coat removed,
showing an unsightly sore; and above it a label with some writing.

In some places, for the distance of many rods, the whole line of
flagging immediately at the base of the wall, would be completely
covered with inscriptions, the beggars standing over them in silence.

But as you passed along these horrible records, in an hour’s time
destined to be obliterated by the feet of thousands and thousands of
wayfarers, you were not left unassailed by the clamorous petitions of
the more urgent applicants for charity. They beset you on every hand;
catching you by the coat; hanging on, and following you along; and,
_for Heaven’s sake,_ and _for God’s sake,_ and _for Christ’s sake,_
beseeching of you but _one ha’penny._ If you so much as glanced your
eye on one of them, even for an instant, it was perceived like
lightning, and the person never left your side until you turned into
another street, or satisfied his demands. Thus, at least, it was with
the sailors; though I observed that the beggars treated the town’s
people differently.

I can not say that the seamen did much to relieve the destitution which
three times every day was presented to their view. Perhaps habit had
made them callous; but the truth might have been that very few of them
had much money to give. Yet the beggars must have had some inducement
to infest the dock walls as they did.

As an example of the caprice of sailors, and their sympathy with
suffering among members of their own calling, I must mention the case
of an old man, who every day, and all day long, through sunshine and
rain, occupied a particular corner, where crowds of tars were always
passing. He was an uncommonly large, plethoric man, with a wooden leg,
and dressed in the nautical garb; his face was red and round; he was
continually merry; and with his wooden stump thrust forth, so as almost
to trip up the careless wayfarer, he sat upon a great pile of monkey
jackets, with a little depression in them between his knees, to receive
the coppers thrown him. And plenty of pennies were tost into his
poor-box by the sailors, who always exchanged a pleasant word with the
old man, and passed on, generally regardless of the neighboring
beggars.

The first morning I went ashore with my shipmates, some of them greeted
him as an old acquaintance; for that corner he had occupied for many
long years. He was an old man-of-war’s man, who had lost his leg at the
battle of Trafalgar; and singular to tell, he now exhibited his wooden
one as a genuine specimen of the oak timbers of Nelson’s ship, the
Victory.

Among the paupers were several who wore old sailor hats and jackets,
and claimed to be destitute tars; and on the strength of these
pretensions demanded help from their brethren; but Jack would see
through their disguise in a moment, and turn away, with no benediction.

As I daily passed through this lane of beggars, who thronged the docks
as the Hebrew cripples did the Pool of Bethesda, and as I thought of my
utter inability in any way to help them, I could not but offer up a
prayer, that some angel might descend, and turn the waters of the docks
into an elixir, that would heal all their woes, and make them, man and
woman, healthy and whole as their ancestors, Adam and Eve, in the
garden.

Adam and Eve! If indeed ye are yet alive and in heaven, may it be no
part of your immortality to look down upon the world ye have left. For
as all these sufferers and cripples are as much your family as young
Abel, so, to you, the sight of the world’s woes would be a parental
torment indeed.




CHAPTER XXXIX.
THE BOOBLE-ALLEYS OF THE TOWN


The same sights that are to be met with along the dock walls at noon,
in a less degree, though diversified with other scenes, are continually
encountered in the narrow streets where the sailor boarding-houses are
kept.

In the evening, especially when the sailors are gathered in great
numbers, these streets present a most singular spectacle, the entire
population of the vicinity being seemingly turned into them.
Hand-organs, fiddles, and cymbals, plied by strolling musicians, mix
with the songs of the seamen, the babble of women and children, and the
groaning and whining of beggars. From the various boarding-houses, each
distinguished by gilded emblems outside—an anchor, a crown, a ship, a
windlass, or a dolphin—proceeds the noise of revelry and dancing; and
from the open casements lean young girls and old women, chattering and
laughing with the crowds in the middle of the street. Every moment
strange greetings are exchanged between old sailors who chance to
stumble upon a shipmate, last seen in Calcutta or Savannah; and the
invariable courtesy that takes place upon these occasions, is to go to
the next spirit-vault, and drink each other’s health.

There are particular paupers who frequent particular sections of these
streets, and who, I was told, resented the intrusion of mendicants from
other parts of the town.

Chief among them was a white-haired old man, stone-blind; who was led
up and down through the long tumult by a woman holding a little saucer
to receive contributions. This old man sang, or rather chanted, certain
words in a peculiarly long-drawn, guttural manner, throwing back his
head, and turning up his sightless eyeballs to the sky. His chant was a
lamentation upon his infirmity; and at the time it produced the same
effect upon me, that my first reading of Milton’s Invocation to the Sun
did, years afterward. I can not recall it all; but it was something
like this, drawn out in an endless groan—

“Here goes the blind old man; blind, blind, blind; no more will he see
sun nor moon—no more see sun nor moon!” And thus would he pass through
the middle of the street; the woman going on in advance, holding his
hand, and dragging him through all obstructions; now and then leaving
him standing, while she went among the crowd soliciting coppers.

But one of the most curious features of the scene is the number of
sailor ballad-singers, who, after singing their verses, hand you a
printed copy, and beg you to buy. One of these persons, dressed like a
man-of-war’s-man, I observed every day standing at a corner in the
middle of the street. He had a full, noble voice, like a church-organ;
and his notes rose high above the surrounding din. But the remarkable
thing about this ballad-singer was one of his arms, which, while
singing, he somehow swung vertically round and round in the air, as if
it revolved on a pivot. The feat was unnaturally unaccountable; and he
performed it with the view of attracting sympathy; since he said that
in falling from a frigate’s mast-head to the deck, he had met with an
injury, which had resulted in making his wonderful arm what it was.

I made the acquaintance of this man, and found him no common character.
He was full of marvelous adventures, and abounded in terrific stories
of pirates and sea murders, and all sorts of nautical enormities. He
was a monomaniac upon these subjects; he was a Newgate Calendar of the
robberies and assassinations of the day, happening in the sailor
quarters of the town; and most of his ballads were upon kindred
subjects. He composed many of his own verses, and had them printed for
sale on his own account. To show how expeditious he was at this
business, it may be mentioned, that one evening on leaving the dock to
go to supper, I perceived a crowd gathered about the _Old Fort Tavern;_
and mingling with the rest, I learned that a woman of the town had just
been killed at the bar by a drunken Spanish sailor from Cadiz. The
murderer was carried off by the police before my eyes, and the very
next morning the ballad-singer with the miraculous arm, was singing the
tragedy in front of the boarding-houses, and handing round printed
copies of the song, which, of course, were eagerly bought up by the
seamen.

This passing allusion to the murder will convey some idea of the events
which take place in the lowest and most abandoned neighborhoods
frequented by sailors in Liverpool. The pestilent lanes and alleys
which, in their vocabulary, go by the names of Rotten-row,
Gibraltar-place, and Booble-alley, are putrid with vice and crime; to
which, perhaps, the round globe does not furnish a parallel. The sooty
and begrimed bricks of the very houses have a reeking, Sodomlike, and
murderous look; and well may the shroud of coal-smoke, which hangs over
this part of the town, more than any other, attempt to hide the
enormities here practiced. These are the haunts from which sailors
sometimes disappear forever; or issue in the morning, robbed naked,
from the broken doorways. These are the haunts in which cursing,
gambling, pickpocketing, and common iniquities, are virtues too lofty
for the infected gorgons and hydras to practice. Propriety forbids that
I should enter into details; but kidnappers, burkers, and
resurrectionists are almost saints and angels to them. They seem
leagued together, a company of miscreant misanthropes, bent upon doing
all the malice to mankind in their power. With sulphur and brimstone
they ought to be burned out of their arches like vermin.




CHAPTER XL.
PLACARDS, BRASS-JEWELERS, TRUCK-HORSES, AND STEAMERS


As I wish to group together what fell under my observation concerning
the Liverpool docks, and the scenes roundabout, I will try to throw
into this chapter various minor things that I recall.

The advertisements of pauperism chalked upon the flagging round the
dock walls, are singularly accompanied by a multitude of quite
different announcements, placarded upon the walls themselves. They are
principally notices of the approaching departure of _“superior,
fast-sailing, coppered and copper-fastened ships,”_ for the United
States, Canada, New South Wales, and other places. Interspersed with
these, are the advertisements of Jewish clothesmen, informing the
judicious seamen where he can procure of the best and the cheapest;
together with ambiguous medical announcements of the tribe of quacks
and empirics who prey upon all seafaring men. Not content with thus
publicly giving notice of their whereabouts, these indefatigable
Sangrados and pretended Samaritans hire a parcel of shabby
workhouse-looking knaves, whose business consists in haunting the dock
walls about meal times, and silently thrusting mysterious little
billets—duodecimo editions of the larger advertisements—into the
astonished hands of the tars.

They do this, with such a mysterious hang-dog wink; such a sidelong
air; such a villainous assumption of your necessities; that, at first,
you are almost tempted to knock them down for their pains.

Conspicuous among the notices on the walls, are huge Italic inducements
to all seamen disgusted with the merchant service, to accept a round
bounty, and embark in her Majesty’s navy.

In the British armed marine, in time of peace, they do not ship men for
the general service, as in the American navy; but for particular ships,
going upon particular cruises. Thus, the frigate Thetis may be
announced as about to sail under the command of that fine old sailor,
and noble father to his crew, _Lord George Flagstaff._

Similar announcements may be seen upon the walls concerning enlistments
in the army. And never did auctioneer dilate with more rapture upon the
charms of some country-seat put up for sale, than the authors of these
placards do, upon the beauty and salubrity of the distant climes, for
which the regiments wanting recruits are about to sail. Bright lawns,
vine-clad hills, endless meadows of verdure, here make up the
landscape; and adventurous young gentlemen, fond of travel, are
informed, that here is a chance for them to see the world at their
leisure, and be paid for enjoying themselves into the bargain. The
regiments for India are promised plantations among valleys of palms;
while to those destined for New Holland, a novel sphere of life and
activity is opened; and the companies bound to Canada and Nova Scotia
are lured by tales of summer suns, that ripen grapes in December. No
word of war is breathed; hushed is the clang of arms in these
announcements; and the sanguine recruit is almost tempted to expect
that pruning-hooks, instead of swords, will be the weapons he will
wield.

Alas! is not this the cruel stratagem of Bruce at Bannockburn, who
decoyed to his war-pits by covering them over with green boughs? For
instead of a farm at the blue base of the Himalayas, the Indian recruit
encounters the keen saber of the Sikh; and instead of basking in sunny
bowers, the Canadian soldier stands a shivering sentry upon the bleak
ramparts of Quebec, a lofty mark for the bitter blasts from Baffin’s
Bay and Labrador. There, as his eye sweeps down the St. Lawrence, whose
every billow is bound for the main that laves the shore of Old England;
as he thinks of his long term of enlistment, which sells him to the
army as Doctor Faust sold himself to the devil; how the poor fellow
must groan in his grief, and call to mind the church-yard stile, and
his Mary.

These army announcements are well fitted to draw recruits in Liverpool.
Among the vast number of emigrants, who daily arrive from all parts of
Britain to embark for the United States or the colonies, there are many
young men, who, upon arriving at Liverpool, find themselves next to
penniless; or, at least, with only enough money to carry them over the
sea, without providing for future contingencies. How easily and
naturally, then, may such youths be induced to enter upon the military
life, which promises them a free passage to the most distant and
flourishing colonies, and certain pay for doing nothing; besides
holding out hopes of vineyards and farms, to be verified in the
fullness of time. For in a moneyless youth, the decision to leave home
at all, and embark upon a long voyage to reside in a remote clime, is a
piece of adventurousness only one removed from the spirit that prompts
the army recruit to enlist.

I never passed these advertisements, surrounded by crowds of gaping
emigrants, without thinking of rattraps.

Besides the mysterious agents of the quacks, who privily thrust their
little notes into your hands, folded up like a powder; there are
another set of rascals prowling about the docks, chiefly at dusk; who
make strange motions to you, and beckon you to one side, as if they had
some state secret to disclose, intimately connected with the weal of
the commonwealth. They nudge you with an elbow full of indefinite hints
and intimations; they glitter upon you an eye like a Jew’s or a
pawnbroker’s; they dog you like Italian assassins. But if the blue coat
of a policeman chances to approach, how quickly they strive to look
completely indifferent, as to the surrounding universe; how they
saunter off, as if lazily wending their way to an affectionate wife and
family.

The first time one of these mysterious personages accosted me, I
fancied him crazy, and hurried forward to avoid him. But arm in arm
with my shadow, he followed after; till amazed at his conduct, I turned
round and paused.

He was a little, shabby, old man, with a forlorn looking coat and hat;
and his hand was fumbling in his vest pocket, as if to take out a card
with his address. Seeing me stand still he made a sign toward a dark
angle of the wall, near which we were; when taking him for a cunning
foot-pad, I again wheeled about, and swiftly passed on. But though I
did not look round, I _felt_ him following me still; so once more I
stopped. The fellow now assumed so mystic and admonitory an air, that I
began to fancy he came to me on some warning errand; that perhaps a
plot had been laid to blow up the Liverpool docks, and he was some
Monteagle bent upon accomplishing my flight. I was determined to see
what he was. With all my eyes about me, I followed him into the arch of
a warehouse; when he gazed round furtively, and silently showing me a
ring, whispered, “You may have it for a shilling; it’s pure gold—I
found it in the gutter—hush! don’t speak! give me the money, and it’s
yours.”

“My friend,” said I, “I don’t trade in these articles; I don’t want
your ring.”

“Don’t you? Then take that,” he whispered, in an intense hushed
passion; and I fell flat from a blow on the chest, while this infamous
jeweler made away with himself out of sight. This business transaction
was conducted with a counting-house promptitude that astonished me.

After that, I shunned these scoundrels like the leprosy: and the next
time I was pertinaciously followed, I stopped, and in a loud voice,
pointed out the man to the passers-by; upon which he absconded; rapidly
turning up into sight a pair of obliquely worn and battered boot-heels.
I could not help thinking that these sort of fellows, so given to
running away upon emergencies, must furnish a good deal of work to the
shoemakers; as they might, also, to the growers of hemp and
gallows-joiners.

Belonging to a somewhat similar fraternity with these irritable
merchants of brass jewelry just mentioned, are the peddlers of
Sheffield razors, mostly boys, who are hourly driven out of the dock
gates by the police; nevertheless, they contrive to saunter back, and
board the vessels, going among the sailors and privately exhibiting
their wares. Incited by the extreme cheapness of one of the razors, and
the gilding on the case containing it, a shipmate of mine purchased it
on the spot for a commercial equivalent of the price, in tobacco. On
the following Sunday, he used that razor; and the result was a pair of
tormented and tomahawked cheeks, that almost required a surgeon to
dress them. In old times, by the way, it was not a bad thought, that
suggested the propriety of a barber’s practicing surgery in connection
with the chin-harrowing vocation.

Another class of knaves, who practice upon the sailors in Liverpool,
are the pawnbrokers, inhabiting little rookeries among the narrow lanes
adjoining the dock. I was astonished at the multitude of gilded balls
in these streets, emblematic of their calling. They were generally next
neighbors to the gilded grapes over the spirit-vaults; and no doubt,
mutually to facilitate business operations, some of these
establishments have connecting doors inside, so as to play their
customers into each other’s hands. I often saw sailors in a state of
intoxication rushing from a spirit-vault into a pawnbroker’s; stripping
off their boots, hats, jackets, and neckerchiefs, and sometimes even
their pantaloons on the spot, and offering to pawn them for a song. Of
course such applications were never refused. But though on shore, at
Liverpool, poor Jack finds more sharks than at sea, he himself is by no
means exempt from practices, that do not savor of a rigid morality; at
least according to law. In tobacco smuggling he is an adept: and when
cool and collected, often manages to evade the Customs completely, and
land goodly packages of the weed, which owing to the immense duties
upon it in England, commands a very high price.

As soon as we came to anchor in the river, before reaching the dock,
three Custom-house underlings boarded us, and coming down into the
forecastle, ordered the men to produce all the tobacco they had.
Accordingly several pounds were brought forth.

“Is that all?” asked the officers.

“All,” said the men.

“We will see,” returned the others.

And without more ado, they emptied the chests right and left; tossed
over the bunks and made a thorough search of the premises; but
discovered nothing. The sailors were then given to understand, that
while the ship lay in dock, the tobacco must remain in the cabin, under
custody of the chief mate, who every morning would dole out to them one
plug per head, as a security against their carrying it ashore.

“Very good,” said the men.

But several of them had secret places in the ship, from whence they
daily drew pound after pound of tobacco, which they smuggled ashore in
the manner following.

When the crew went to meals, each man carried at least one plug in his
pocket; _that_ he had a right to; and as many more were hidden about
his person as he dared. Among the great crowds pouring out of the
dock-gates at such hours, of course these smugglers stood little chance
of detection; although vigilant looking policemen were always standing
by. And though these _“Charlies”_ might suppose there were tobacco
smugglers passing; yet to hit the right man among such a throng, would
be as hard, as to harpoon a speckled porpoise, one of ten thousand
darting under a ship’s bows.

Our forecastle was often visited by foreign sailors, who knowing we
came from America, were anxious to purchase tobacco at a cheap rate;
for in Liverpool it is about an American penny per pipe-full. Along the
docks they sell an English pennyworth, put up in a little roll like
confectioners’ mottoes, with poetical lines, or instructive little
moral precepts printed in red on the back.

Among all the sights of the docks, the noble truck-horses are not the
least striking to a stranger. They are large and powerful brutes, with
such sleek and glossy coats, that they look as if brushed and put on by
a valet every morning. They march with a slow and stately step, lifting
their ponderous hoofs like royal Siam elephants. Thou shalt not lay
stripes upon these Roman citizens; for their docility is such, they are
guided without rein or lash; they go or come, halt or march on, at a
whisper. So grave, dignified, gentlemanly, and courteous did these fine
truck-horses look—so full of calm intelligence and sagacity, that often
I endeavored to get into conversation with them, as they stood in
contemplative attitudes while their loads were preparing. But all I
could get from them was the mere recognition of a friendly neigh;
though I would stake much upon it that, could I have spoken in their
language, I would have derived from them a good deal of valuable
information touching the docks, where they passed the whole of their
dignified lives.

There are unknown worlds of knowledge in brutes; and whenever you mark
a horse, or a dog, with a peculiarly mild, calm, deep-seated eye, be
sure he is an Aristotle or a Kant, tranquilly speculating upon the
mysteries in man. No philosophers so thoroughly comprehend us as dogs
and horses. They see through us at a glance. And after all, what is a
horse but a species of four-footed dumb man, in a leathern overall, who
happens to live upon oats, and toils for his masters, half-requited or
abused, like the biped hewers of wood and drawers of water? But there
is a touch of divinity even in brutes, and a special halo about a
horse, that should forever exempt him from indignities. As for those
majestic, magisterial truck-horses of the docks, I would as soon think
of striking a judge on the bench, as to lay violent hand upon their
holy hides.

It is wonderful what loads their majesties will condescend to draw. The
truck is a large square platform, on four low wheels; and upon this the
lumpers pile bale after bale of cotton, as if they were filling a large
warehouse, and yet a procession of three of these horses will
tranquilly walk away with the whole.

The truckmen themselves are almost as singular a race as their animals.
Like the Judiciary in England, they wear gowns,—not of the same cut and
color though,—which reach below their knees; and from the racket they
make on the pavements with their hob-nailed brogans, you would think
they patronized the same shoemaker with their horses. I never could get
any thing out of these truckmen. They are a reserved, sober-sided set,
who, with all possible solemnity, march at the head of their animals;
now and then gently advising them to sheer to the right or the left, in
order to avoid some passing vehicle. Then spending so much of their
lives in the high-bred company of their horses, seems to have mended
their manners and improved their taste, besides imparting to them
something of the dignity of their animals; but it has also given to
them a sort of refined and uncomplaining aversion to human society.

There are many strange stories told of the truck-horse. Among others is
the following: There was a parrot, that from having long been suspended
in its cage from a low window fronting a dock, had learned to converse
pretty fluently in the language of the stevedores and truckmen. One day
a truckman left his vehicle standing on the quay, with its back to the
water. It was noon, when an interval of silence falls upon the docks;
and Poll, seeing herself face to face with the horse, and having a mind
for a chat, cried out to him, _“Back! back! back!”_

Backward went the horse, precipitating himself and truck into the
water.

Brunswick Dock, to the west of Prince’s, is one of the most interesting
to be seen. Here lie the various black steamers (so unlike the American
boats, since they have to navigate the boisterous Narrow Seas) plying
to all parts of the three kingdoms. Here you see vast quantities of
produce, imported from starving Ireland; here you see the decks turned
into pens for oxen and sheep; and often, side by side with these
inclosures, Irish deck-passengers, thick as they can stand, seemingly
penned in just like the cattle. It was the beginning of July when the
Highlander arrived in port; and the Irish laborers were daily coming
over by thousands, to help harvest the English crops.

One morning, going into the town, I heard a tramp, as of a drove of
buffaloes, behind me; and turning round, beheld the entire middle of
the street filled by a great crowd of these men, who had just emerged
from Brunswick Dock gates, arrayed in long-tailed coats of hoddin-gray,
corduroy knee-breeches, and shod with shoes that raised a mighty dust.
Flourishing their Donnybrook shillelahs, they looked like an irruption
of barbarians. They were marching straight out of town into the
country; and perhaps out of consideration for the finances of the
corporation, took the middle of the street, to save the side-walks.

“Sing _Langolee, and the Lakes of Killarney,”_ cried one fellow,
tossing his stick into the air, as he danced in his brogans at the head
of the rabble. And so they went! capering on, merry as pipers.

When I thought of the multitudes of Irish that annually land on the
shores of the United States and Canada, and, to my surprise, witnessed
the additional multitudes embarking from Liverpool to New Holland; and
when, added to all this, I daily saw these hordes of laborers,
descending, thick as locusts, upon the English corn-fields; I could not
help marveling at the fertility of an island, which, though her crop of
potatoes may fail, never yet failed in bringing her annual crop of men
into the world.




CHAPTER XLI.
REDBURN ROVES ABOUT HITHER AND THITHER


I do not know that any other traveler would think it worth while to
mention such a thing; but the fact is, that during the summer months in
Liverpool, the days are exceedingly lengthy; and the first evening I
found myself walking in the twilight after nine o’clock, I tried to
recall my astronomical knowledge, in order to account satisfactorily
for so curious a phenomenon. But the days in summer, and the nights in
winter, are just as long in Liverpool as at Cape Horn; for the latitude
of the two places very nearly corresponds.

These Liverpool days, however, were a famous thing for me; who,
thereby, was enabled after my day’s work aboard the Highlander, to
ramble about the town for several hours. After I had visited all the
noted places I could discover, of those marked down upon my father’s
map, I began to extend my rovings indefinitely; forming myself into a
committee of one, to investigate all accessible parts of the town;
though so many years have elapsed, ere I have thought of bringing in my
report.

This was a great delight to me: for wherever I have been in the world,
I have always taken a vast deal of lonely satisfaction in wandering
about, up and down, among out-of-the-way streets and alleys, and
speculating upon the strangers I have met. Thus, in Liverpool I used to
pace along endless streets of dwelling-houses, looking at the names on
the doors, admiring the pretty faces in the windows, and invoking a
passing blessing upon the chubby children on the door-steps. I was
stared at myself, to be sure: but what of that? We must give and take
on such occasions. In truth, I and my shooting-jacket produced quite a
sensation in Liverpool: and I have no doubt, that many a father of a
family went home to his children with a curious story, about a
wandering phenomenon they had encountered, traversing the side-walks
that day. In the words of the old song, _“I cared for nobody, no not I,
and nobody cared for me.”_ I stared my fill with impunity, and took all
stares myself in good part.

Once I was standing in a large square, gaping at a splendid chariot
drawn up at a portico. The glossy horses quivered with good-living, and
so did the sumptuous calves of the gold-laced coachman and footmen in
attendance. I was particularly struck with the red cheeks of these men:
and the many evidences they furnished of their enjoying this meal with
a wonderful relish.

While thus standing, I all at once perceived, that the objects of my
curiosity, were making me an object of their own; and that they were
gazing at me, as if I were some unauthorized intruder upon the British
soil. Truly, they had reason: for when I now think of the figure I must
have cut in those days, I only marvel that, in my many strolls, my
passport was not a thousand times demanded.

Nevertheless, I was only a forlorn looking mortal among tens of
thousands of rags and tatters. For in some parts of the town, inhabited
by laborers, and poor people generally; I used to crowd my way through
masses of squalid men, women, and children, who at this evening hour,
in those quarters of Liverpool, seem to empty themselves into the
street, and live there for the time. I had never seen any thing like it
in New York. Often, I witnessed some curious, and many very sad scenes;
and especially I remembered encountering a pale, ragged man, rushing
along frantically, and striving to throw off his wife and children, who
clung to his arms and legs; and, in God’s name, conjured him not to
desert them. He seemed bent upon rushing down to the water, and
drowning himself, in some despair, and craziness of wretchedness. In
these haunts, beggary went on before me wherever I walked, and dogged
me unceasingly at the heels. Poverty, poverty, poverty, in almost
endless vistas: and want and woe staggered arm in arm along these
miserable streets.

And here, I must not omit one thing, that struck me at the time. It was
the absence of negroes; who in the large towns in the “free states” of
America, almost always form a considerable portion of the destitute.
But in these streets, not a negro was to be seen. All were whites; and
with the exception of the Irish, were natives of the soil: even
Englishmen; as much Englishmen, as the dukes in the House of Lords.
This conveyed a strange feeling: and more than any thing else, reminded
me that I was not in my own land. For _there,_ such a being as a native
beggar is almost unknown; and to be a born American citizen seems a
guarantee against pauperism; and this, perhaps, springs from the virtue
of a vote.

Speaking of negroes, recalls the looks of interest with which
negro-sailors are regarded when they walk the Liverpool streets. In
Liverpool indeed the negro steps with a prouder pace, and lifts his
head like a man; for here, no such exaggerated feeling exists in
respect to him, as in America. Three or four times, I encountered our
black steward, dressed very handsomely, and walking arm in arm with a
good-looking English woman. In New York, such a couple would have been
mobbed in three minutes; and the steward would have been lucky to
escape with whole limbs. Owing to the friendly reception extended to
them, and the unwonted immunities they enjoy in Liverpool, the black
cooks and stewards of American ships are very much attached to the
place and like to make voyages to it.

Being so young and inexperienced then, and unconsciously swayed in some
degree by those local and social prejudices, that are the marring of
most men, and from which, for the mass, there seems no possible escape;
at first I was surprised that a colored man should be treated as he is
in this town; but a little reflection showed that, after all, it was
but recognizing his claims to humanity and normal equality; so that, in
some things, we Americans leave to other countries the carrying out of
the principle that stands at the head of our Declaration of
Independence.

During my evening strolls in the wealthier quarters, I was subject to a
continual mortification. It was the humiliating fact, wholly unforeseen
by me, that upon the whole, and barring the poverty and beggary,
Liverpool, away from the docks, was very much such a place as New York.
There were the same sort of streets pretty much; the same rows of
houses with stone steps; the same kind of side-walks and curbs; and the
same elbowing, heartless-looking crowd as ever.

I came across the Leeds Canal, one afternoon; but, upon my word, no one
could have told it from the Erie Canal at Albany. I went into St.
John’s Market on a Saturday night; and though it was strange enough to
see that great roof supported by so many pillars, yet the most
discriminating observer would not have been able to detect any
difference between the articles exposed for sale, and the articles
exhibited in Fulton Market, New York.

I walked down Lord-street, peering into the jewelers’ shops; but I
thought I was walking down a block in Broadway. I began to think that
all this talk about travel was a humbug; and that he who lives in a
nut-shell, lives in an epitome of the universe, and has but little to
see beyond him.

It is true, that I often thought of London’s being only seven or eight
hours’ travel by railroad from where I was; and that _there,_ surely,
must be a world of wonders waiting my eyes: but more of London anon.

Sundays were the days upon which I made my longest explorations. I rose
bright and early, with my whole plan of operations in my head. First
walking into some dock hitherto unexamined, and then to breakfast. Then
a walk through the more fashionable streets, to see the people going to
church; and then I myself went to church, selecting the goodliest
edifice, and the tallest Kentuckian of a spire I could find.

For I am an admirer of church architecture; and though, perhaps, the
sums spent in erecting magnificent cathedrals might better go to the
founding of charities, yet since these structures are built, those who
disapprove of them in one sense, may as well have the benefit of them
in another.

It is a most Christian thing, and a matter most sweet to dwell upon and
simmer over in solitude, that any poor sinner may go to church wherever
he pleases; and that even St. Peter’s in Rome is open to him, as to a
cardinal; that St. Paul’s in London is not shut against him; and that
the Broadway Tabernacle, in New York, opens all her broad aisles to
him, and will not even have doors and thresholds to her pews, the
better to allure him by an unbounded invitation. I say, this
consideration of the hospitality and democracy in churches, is a most
Christian and charming thought. It speaks whole volumes of folios, and
Vatican libraries, for Christianity; it is more eloquent, and goes
farther home than all the sermons of Massillon, Jeremy Taylor, Wesley,
and Archbishop Tillotson.

Nothing daunted, therefore, by thinking of my being a stranger in the
land; nothing daunted by the architectural superiority and costliness
of any Liverpool church; or by the streams of silk dresses and fine
broadcloth coats flowing into the aisles, I used humbly to present
myself before the sexton, as a candidate for admission. He would stare
a little, perhaps (one of them once hesitated), but in the end, what
could he do but show me into a pew; not the most commodious of pews, to
be sure; nor commandingly located; nor within very plain sight or
hearing of the pulpit. No; it was remarkable, that there was always
some confounded pillar or obstinate angle of the wall in the way; and I
used to think, that the sextons of Liverpool must have held a secret
meeting on my account, and resolved to apportion me the most
inconvenient pew in the churches under their charge. However, they
always gave me a seat of some sort or other; sometimes even on an oaken
bench in the open air of the aisle, where I would sit, dividing the
attention of the congregation between myself and the clergyman. The
whole congregation seemed to know that I was a foreigner of
distinction.

It was sweet to hear the service read, the organ roll, the sermon
preached—just as the same things were going on three thousand five
hundred miles off, at home! But then, the prayer in behalf of her
majesty the Queen, somewhat threw me back. Nevertheless, I joined in
that prayer, and invoked for the lady the best wishes of a poor Yankee.

How I loved to sit in the holy hush of those brown old monastic aisles,
thinking of Harry the Eighth, and the Reformation! How I loved to go a
roving with my eye, all along the sculptured walls and buttresses;
winding in among the intricacies of the pendent ceiling, and wriggling
my fancied way like a wood-worm. I could have sat there all the morning
long, through noon, unto night. But at last the benediction would come;
and appropriating my share of it, I would slowly move away, thinking
how I should like to go home with some of the portly old gentlemen,
with high-polished boots and Malacca canes, and take a seat at their
cosy and comfortable dinner-tables. But, alas! there was no dinner for
me except at the sign of the Baltimore Clipper.

Yet the Sunday dinners that Handsome Mary served up were not to be
scorned. The roast beef of Old England abounded; and so did the
immortal plum-puddings, and the unspeakably capital gooseberry pies.
But to finish off with that abominable _“swipes”_ almost spoiled all
the rest: not that I myself patronized _“swipes”_ but my shipmates did;
and every cup I saw them drink, I could not choose but taste in
imagination, and even then the flavor was bad.

On Sundays, at dinner-time, as, indeed, on every other day, it was
curious to watch the proceedings at the sign of the Clipper. The
servant girls were running about, mustering the various crews, whose
dinners were spread, each in a separate apartment; and who were
collectively known by the names of their ships.

“Where are the _Arethusas?—_Here’s their beef been smoking this
half-hour.”—“Fly, Betty, my dear, here come the _Splendids.”—_ “Run,
Molly, my love; get the salt-cellars for the _Highlanders_ .”—“You
Peggy, where’s the _Siddons’ pickle-pat?”—“I_ say, Judy, are you never
coming with that pudding for the _Lord Nelsons?”_

On week days, we did not fare quite so well as on Sundays; and once we
came to dinner, and found two enormous bullock hearts smoking at each
end of the Highlanders’ table. Jackson was indignant at the outrage.

He always sat at the head of the table; and this time he squared
himself on his bench, and erecting his knife and fork like flag-staffs,
so as to include the two hearts between them, he called out for Danby,
the boarding-house keeper; for although his wife Mary was in fact at
the head of the establishment, yet Danby himself always came in for the
fault-findings.

Danby obsequiously appeared, and stood in the doorway, well knowing the
philippics that were coming. But he was not prepared for the peroration
of Jackson’s address to him; which consisted of the two bullock hearts,
snatched bodily off the dish, and flung at his head, by way of a
recapitulation of the preceding arguments. The company then broke up in
disgust, and dined elsewhere.

Though I almost invariably attended church on Sunday mornings, yet the
rest of the day I spent on my travels; and it was on one of these
afternoon strolls, that on passing through St. George’s-square, I found
myself among a large crowd, gathered near the base of George the
Fourth’s equestrian statue.

The people were mostly mechanics and artisans in their holiday clothes;
but mixed with them were a good many soldiers, in lean, lank, and
dinnerless undresses, and sporting attenuated rattans. These troops
belonged to the various regiments then in town. Police officers, also,
were conspicuous in their uniforms. At first perfect silence and
decorum prevailed.

Addressing this orderly throng was a pale, hollow-eyed young man, in a
snuff-colored surtout, who looked worn with much watching, or much
toil, or too little food. His features were good, his whole air was
respectable, and there was no mistaking the fact, that he was strongly
in earnest in what he was saying.

In his hand was a soiled, inflammatory-looking pamphlet, from which he
frequently read; following up the quotations with nervous appeals to
his hearers, a rolling of his eyes, and sometimes the most frantic
gestures. I was not long within hearing of him, before I became aware
that this youth was a Chartist.

Presently the crowd increased, and some commotion was raised, when I
noticed the police officers augmenting in number; and by and by, they
began to glide through the crowd, politely hinting at the propriety of
dispersing. The first persons thus accosted were the soldiers, who
accordingly sauntered off, switching their rattans, and admiring their
high-polished shoes. It was plain that the Charter did not hang very
heavy round their hearts. For the rest, they also gradually broke up;
and at last I saw the speaker himself depart.

I do not know why, but I thought he must be some despairing elder son,
supporting by hard toil his mother and sisters; for of such many
political desperadoes are made.

That same Sunday afternoon, I strolled toward the outskirts of the
town, and attracted by the sight of two great Pompey’s pillars, in the
shape of black steeples, apparently rising directly from the soil, I
approached them with much curiosity. But looking over a low parapet
connecting them, what was my surprise to behold at my feet a smoky
hollow in the ground, with rocky walls, and dark holes at one end,
carrying out of view several lines of iron railways; while far beyond,
straight out toward the open country, ran an endless railroad. Over the
place, a handsome Moorish arch of stone was flung; and gradually, as I
gazed upon it, and at the little side arches at the bottom of the
hollow, there came over me an undefinable feeling, that I had
previously seen the whole thing before. Yet how could that be?
Certainly, I had never been in Liverpool before: but then, that Moorish
arch! surely I remembered that very well. It was not till several
months after reaching home in America, that my perplexity upon this
matter was cleared away. In glancing over an old number of the Penny
Magazine, there I saw a picture of the place to the life; and
remembered having seen the same print years previous. It was a
representation of the spot where the Manchester railroad enters the
outskirts of the town.




CHAPTER XLII.
HIS ADVENTURE WITH THE _CROSS_ OLD GENTLEMAN


My adventure in the News-Room in the Exchange, which I have related in
a previous chapter, reminds me of another, at the Lyceum, some days
after, which may as well be put down here, before I forget it.

I was strolling down Bold-street, I think it was, when I was struck by
the sight of a brown stone building, very large and handsome. The
windows were open, and there, nicely seated, with their comfortable
legs crossed over their comfortable knees, I beheld several sedate,
happy-looking old gentlemen reading the magazines and papers, and one
had a fine gilded volume in his hand.

Yes, this must be the Lyceum, thought I; let me see. So I whipped out
my guide-book, and opened it at the proper place; and sure enough, the
building before me corresponded stone for stone. I stood awhile on the
opposite side of the street, gazing at my picture, and then at its
original; and often dwelling upon the pleasant gentlemen sitting at the
open windows; till at last I felt an uncontrollable impulse to step in
for a moment, and run over the news.

I’m a poor, friendless sailor-boy, thought I, and they can not object;
especially as I am from a foreign land, and strangers ought to be
treated with courtesy. I turned the matter over again, as I walked
across the way; and with just a small tapping of a misgiving at my
heart, I at last scraped my feet clean against the curb-stone, and
taking off my hat while I was yet in the open air, slowly sauntered in.

But I had not got far into that large and lofty room, filled with many
agreeable sights, when a crabbed old gentleman lifted up his eye from
the _London Times,_ which words I saw boldly printed on the back of the
large sheet in his hand, and looking at me as if I were a strange dog
with a muddy hide, that had stolen out of the gutter into this fine
apartment, he shook his silver-headed cane at me fiercely, till the
spectacles fell off his nose. Almost at the same moment, up stepped a
terribly cross man, who looked as if he had a mustard plaster on his
back, that was continually exasperating him; who throwing down some
papers which he had been filing, took me by my innocent shoulders, and
then, putting his foot against the broad part of my pantaloons, wheeled
me right out into the street, and dropped me on the walk, without so
much as offering an apology for the affront. I sprang after him, but in
vain; the door was closed upon me.

These Englishmen have no manners, that’s plain, thought I; and I
trudged on down the street in a reverie.




CHAPTER XLIII.
HE TAKES A DELIGHTFUL RAMBLE INTO THE COUNTRY; AND MAKES THE
ACQUAINTANCE OF THREE ADORABLE CHARMERS


Who that dwells in America has not heard of the bright fields and green
hedges of England, and longed to behold them? Even so had it been with
me; and now that I was actually in England, I resolved not to go away
without having a good, long look at the open fields.

On a Sunday morning I started, with a lunch in my pocket. It was a
beautiful day in July; the air was sweet with the breath of buds and
flowers, and there was a green splendor in the landscape that ravished
me. Soon I gained an elevation commanding a wide sweep of view; and
meadow and mead, and woodland and hedge, were all around me.

Ay, ay! this was old England, indeed! I had found it at last—there it
was in the country! Hovering over the scene was a soft, dewy air, that
seemed faintly tinged with the green of the grass; and I thought, as I
breathed my breath, that perhaps I might be inhaling the very particles
once respired by Rosamond the Fair.

On I trudged along the London road—smooth as an entry floor—and every
white cottage I passed, embosomed in honeysuckles, seemed alive in the
landscape.

But the day wore on; and at length the sun grew hot; and the long road
became dusty. I thought that some shady place, in some shady field,
would be very pleasant to repose in. So, coming to a charming little
dale, undulating down to a hollow, arched over with foliage, I crossed
over toward it; but paused by the road-side at a frightful
announcement, nailed against an old tree, used as a gate-post—

“MAN-TRAPS AND SPRING-GUNS!”


In America I had never heard of the like. What could it mean? They were
not surely _cannibals,_ that dwelt down in that beautiful little dale,
and lived by catching men, like weasels and beavers in Canada!

“A _man-trap!”_ It must be so. The announcement could bear but one
meaning—that there was something near by, intended to catch human
beings; some species of mechanism, that would suddenly fasten upon the
unwary rover, and hold him by the leg like a dog; or, perhaps, devour
him on the spot.

Incredible! In a Christian land, too! Did that sweet lady, Queen
Victoria, permit such diabolical practices? Had her gracious majesty
ever passed by this way, and seen the announcement?

And who put it there?

The proprietor, probably.

And what right had he to do so?

Why, he owned the soil.

And where are his title-deeds?

In his strong-box, I suppose.

Thus I stood wrapt in cogitations.

You are a pretty fellow, Wellingborough, thought I to myself; you are a
mighty traveler, indeed:—stopped on your travels by a _man-trap!_ Do
you think Mungo Park was so served in Africa? Do you think Ledyard was
so entreated in Siberia? Upon my word, you will go home not very much
wiser than when you set out; and the only excuse you can give, for not
having seen more sights, will be _man-traps—mantraps, my masters!_ that
frightened you!

And then, in my indignation, I fell back upon first principles. What
right has this man to the soil he thus guards with dragons? What
excessive effrontery, to lay sole claim to a solid piece of this
planet, right down to the earth’s axis, and, perhaps, straight through
to the antipodes! For a moment I thought I would test his traps, and
enter the forbidden Eden.

But the grass grew so thickly, and seemed so full of sly things, that
at last I thought best to pace off.

Next, I came to a hawthorn lane, leading down very prettily to a nice
little church; a mossy little church; a beautiful little church; just
such a church as I had always dreamed to be in England. The porch was
viny as an arbor; the ivy was climbing about the tower; and the bees
were humming about the hoary old head-stones along the walls.

Any man-traps here? thought I—any spring-guns?

No.

So I walked on, and entered the church, where I soon found a seat. No
Indian, red as a deer, could have startled the simple people more. They
gazed and they gazed; but as I was all attention to the sermon, and
conducted myself with perfect propriety, they did not expel me, as at
first I almost imagined they might.

Service over, I made my way through crowds of children, who stood
staring at the marvelous stranger, and resumed my stroll along the
London Road.

My next stop was at an inn, where under a tree sat a party of rustics,
drinking ale at a table.

“Good day,” said I.

“Good day; from Liverpool?”

“I guess so.”

“For London?”

“No; not this time. I merely come to see the country.”

At this, they gazed at each other; and I, at myself; having doubts
whether I might not look something like a horse-thief.

“Take a seat,” said the landlord, a fat fellow, with his wife’s apron
on, I thought.

“Thank you.”

And then, little by little, we got into a long talk: in the course of
which, I told who I was, and where I was from. I found these rustics a
good-natured, jolly set; and I have no doubt they found me quite a
sociable youth. They treated me to ale; and I treated them to stories
about America, concerning which, they manifested the utmost curiosity.
One of them, however, was somewhat astonished that I had not made the
acquaintance of a brother of his, who had resided somewhere on the
banks of the Mississippi for several years past; but among twenty
millions of people, I had never happened to meet him, at least to my
knowledge.

At last, leaving this party, I pursued my way, exhilarated by the
lively conversation in which I had shared, and the pleasant sympathies
exchanged: and perhaps, also, by the ale I had drunk:—fine old ale;
yes, English ale, ale brewed in England! And I trod English soil; and
breathed English air; and every blade of grass was an Englishman born.
Smoky old Liverpool, with all its pitch and tar was now far behind;
nothing in sight but open meadows and fields.

Come, Wellingborough, why not push on for London?— Hurra! what say you?
let’s have a peep at St. Paul’s? Don’t you want to see the queen? Have
you no longing to behold the duke? Think of Westminster Abbey, and the
Tunnel under the Thames! Think of Hyde Park, and the ladies!

But then, thought I again, with my hands wildly groping in my two
vacuums of pockets—who’s to pay the bill?—You can’t beg your way,
Wellingborough; that would never do; for you are your father’s son,
Wellingborough; and you must not disgrace your family in a foreign
land; you must not turn pauper.

Ah! Ah! it was indeed too true; there was no St. Paul’s or Westminster
Abbey for me; that was flat.

Well, well, up heart, you’ll see it one of these days.

But think of it! here I am on the very road that leads to the
Thames—think of _that!—_here I am—ay, treading in the wheel-tracks of
coaches that are bound for the metropolis!—It was too bad; too bitterly
bad. But I shoved my old hat over my brows, and walked on; till at last
I came to a green bank, deliriously shaded by a fine old tree with
broad branching arms, that stretched themselves over the road, like a
hen gathering her brood under her wings. Down on the green grass I
threw myself and there lay my head, like a last year’s nut. People
passed by, on foot and in carriages, and little thought that the sad
youth under the tree was the great-nephew of a late senator in the
American Congress.

Presently, I started to my feet, as I heard a gruff voice behind me
from the field, crying out—“What are you doing there, you young
rascal?—run away from the work’us, have ye? Tramp, or I’ll set Blucher
on ye!”

And who was Blucher? A cut-throat looking dog, with his black
bull-muzzle thrust through a gap in the hedge. And his master? A sturdy
farmer, with an alarming cudgel in his hand.

“Come, are you going to start?” he cried.

“Presently,” said I, making off with great dispatch. When I had got a
few yards into the middle of the highroad (which belonged as much to me
as it did to the queen herself), I turned round, like a man on his own
premises, and said— “Stranger! if you ever visit America, just call at
our house, and you’ll always find there a dinner and a bed. Don’t
fail.”

I then walked on toward Liverpool, full of sad thoughts concerning the
cold charities of the world, and the infamous reception given to
hapless young travelers, in broken-down shooting-jackets.

On, on I went, along the skirts of forbidden green fields; until
reaching a cottage, before which I stood rooted.

So sweet a place I had never seen: no palace in Persia could be
pleasanter; there were flowers in the garden; and six red cheeks, like
six moss-roses, hanging from the casement. At the embowered doorway,
sat an old man, confidentially communing with his pipe: while a little
child, sprawling on the ground, was playing with his shoestrings. A
hale matron, but with rather a prim expression, was reading a journal
by his side: and three charmers, three Peris, three Houris! were
leaning out of the window close by.

Ah! Wellingborough, don’t you wish you could step in?

With a heavy heart at his cheerful sigh, I was turning to go, when—is
it possible? the old man called me back, and invited me in.

“Come, come,” said he, “you look as if you had walked far; come, take a
bowl of milk. Matilda, my dear” (how my heart jumped), “go fetch some
from the dairy.” And the white-handed angel did meekly obey, and handed
_me—me,_ the vagabond, a bowl of bubbling milk, which I could hardly
drink down, for gazing at the dew on her lips.

As I live, I could have married that charmer on the spot!

She was by far the most beautiful rosebud I had yet seen in England.
But I endeavored to dissemble my ardent admiration; and in order to do
away at once with any unfavorable impressions arising from the close
scrutiny of my miserable shooting-jacket, which was now taking place, I
declared myself a Yankee sailor from Liverpool, who was spending a
Sunday in the country.

“And have you been to church to-day, young man?” said the old lady,
looking daggers.

“Good madam, I have; the little church down yonder, you know—a most
excellent sermon—I am much the better for it.”

I wanted to mollify this severe looking old lady; for even my short
experience of old ladies had convinced me that they are the hereditary
enemies of all strange young men.

I soon turned the conversation toward America, a theme which I knew
would be interesting, and upon which I could be fluent and agreeable. I
strove to talk in Addisonian English, and ere long could see very
plainly that my polished phrases were making a surprising impression,
though that miserable shooting-jacket of mine was a perpetual drawback
to my claims to gentility.

Spite of all my blandishments, however, the old lady stood her post
like a sentry; and to my inexpressible chagrin, kept the three charmers
in the background, though the old man frequently called upon them to
advance. This fine specimen of an old Englishman seemed to be quite as
free from ungenerous suspicions as his vinegary spouse was full of
them. But I still lingered, snatching furtive glances at the young
ladies, and vehemently talking to the old man about Illinois, and the
river Ohio, and the fine farms in the Genesee country, where, in
harvest time, the laborers went into the wheat fields a thousand
strong.

Stick to it, Wellingborough, thought I; don’t give the old lady time to
think; stick to it, my boy, and an invitation to tea will reward you.
At last it came, and the old lady abated her frowns.

It was the most delightful of meals; the three charmers sat all on one
side, and I opposite, between the old man and his wife. The middle
charmer poured out the souchong, and handed me the buttered muffins;
and such buttered muffins never were spread on the other side of the
Atlantic. The butter had an aromatic flavor; by Jove, it was perfectly
delicious.

And there they sat—the charmers, I mean—eating these buttered muffins
in plain sight. I wished I was a buttered muffin myself. Every minute
they grew handsomer and handsomer; and I could not help thinking what a
fine thing it would be to carry home a beautiful English wife! how my
friends would stare! a lady from England!

I might have been mistaken; but certainly I thought that Matilda, the
one who had handed me the milk, sometimes looked rather benevolently in
the direction where I sat. She certainly _did_ look at my jacket; and I
am constrained to think at my face. Could it be possible she had fallen
in love at first sight? Oh, rapture! But oh, misery! that was out of
the question; for what a looking suitor was Wellingborough?

At length, the old lady glanced toward the door, and made some
observations about its being yet a long walk to town. She handed me the
buttered muffins, too, as if performing a final act of hospitality; and
in other fidgety ways vaguely hinted her desire that I should decamp.

Slowly I rose, and murmured my thanks, and bowed, and tried to be off;
but as quickly I turned, and bowed, and thanked, and lingered again and
again. Oh, charmers! oh, Peris! thought I, must I go? Yes,
Wellingborough, you must; so I made one desperate congee, and darted
through the door.

I have never seen them since: no, nor heard of them; but to this day I
live a bachelor on account of those ravishing charmers.

As the long twilight was waning deeper and deeper into the night, I
entered the town; and, plodding my solitary way to the same old docks,
I passed through the gates, and scrambled my way among tarry smells,
across the tiers of ships between the quay and the Highlander. My only
resource was my bunk; in I turned, and, wearied with my long stroll,
was soon fast asleep, dreaming of red cheeks and roses.




CHAPTER XLIV.
REDBURN INTRODUCES MASTER HARRY BOLTON TO THE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION
OF THE READER


It was the day following my Sunday stroll into the country, and when I
had been in England four weeks or more, that I made the acquaintance of
a handsome, accomplished, but unfortunate youth, young Harry Bolton. He
was one of those small, but perfectly formed beings, with curling hair,
and silken muscles, who seem to have been born in cocoons. His
complexion was a mantling brunette, feminine as a girl’s; his feet were
small; his hands were white; and his eyes were large, black, and
womanly; and, poetry aside, his voice was as the sound of a harp.

But where, among the tarry docks, and smoky sailor-lanes and by-ways of
a seaport, did I, a battered Yankee boy, encounter this courtly youth?

Several evenings I had noticed him in our street of boarding-houses,
standing in the doorways, and silently regarding the animated scenes
without. His beauty, dress, and manner struck me as so out of place in
such a street, that I could not possibly divine what had transplanted
this delicate exotic from the conservatories of some Regent-street to
the untidy potato-patches of Liverpool.

At last I suddenly encountered him at the sign of the Baltimore
Clipper. He was speaking to one of my shipmates concerning America; and
from something that dropped, I was led to imagine that he contemplated
a voyage to my country. Charmed with his appearance, and all eagerness
to enjoy the society of this incontrovertible son of a gentleman—a kind
of pleasure so long debarred me—I smoothed down the skirts of my
jacket, and at once accosted him; declaring who I was, and that nothing
would afford me greater delight than to be of the least service, in
imparting any information concerning America that he needed.

He glanced from my face to my jacket, and from my jacket to my face,
and at length, with a pleased but somewhat puzzled expression, begged
me to accompany him on a walk.

We rambled about St. George’s Pier until nearly midnight; but before we
parted, with uncommon frankness, he told me many strange things
respecting his history.

According to his own account, Harry Bolton was a native of Bury St.
Edmunds, a borough of Suffolk, not very far from London, where he was
early left an orphan, under the charge of an only aunt. Between his
aunt and himself, his mother had divided her fortune; and young Harry
thus fell heir to a portion of about five thousand pounds.

Being of a roving mind, as he approached his majority he grew restless
of the retirement of a country place; especially as he had no
profession or business of any kind to engage his attention.

In vain did Bury, with all its fine old monastic attractions, lure him
to abide on the beautiful banks of her Larke, and under the shadow of
her stately and storied old Saxon tower.

By all my rare old historic associations, breathed Bury; by my
Abbey-gate, that bears to this day the arms of Edward the Confessor; by
my carved roof of the old church of St. Mary’s, which escaped the low
rage of the bigoted Puritans; by the royal ashes of Mary Tudor, that
sleep in my midst; by my Norman ruins, and by all the old abbots of
Bury, do not, oh Harry! abandon me. Where will you find shadier walks
than under my lime-trees? where lovelier gardens than those within the
old walls of my monastery, approached through my lordly Gate? Or if, oh
Harry! indifferent to my historic mosses, and caring not for my annual
verdure, thou must needs be lured by other tassels, and wouldst fain,
like the Prodigal, squander thy patrimony, then, go not away from old
Bury to do it. For here, on Angel-Hill, are my coffee and card-rooms,
and billiard saloons, where you may lounge away your mornings, and
empty your glass and your purse as you list.

In vain. Bury was no place for the adventurous Harry, who must needs
hie to London, where in one winter, in the company of gambling
sportsmen and dandies, he lost his last sovereign.

What now was to be done? His friends made interest for him in the
requisite quarters, and Harry was soon embarked for Bombay, as a
midshipman in the East India service; in which office he was known as a
_“guinea-pig,”_ a humorous appellation then bestowed upon the middies
of the Company. And considering the perversity of his behavior, his
delicate form, and soft complexion, and that gold guineas had been his
bane, this appellation was not altogether, in poor Harry’s case,
inapplicable.

He made one voyage, and returned; another, and returned; and then threw
up his warrant in disgust. A few weeks’ dissipation in London, and
again his purse was almost drained; when, like many prodigals, scorning
to return home to his aunt, and amend—though she had often written him
the kindest of letters to that effect—Harry resolved to precipitate
himself upon the New World, and there carve out a fresh fortune. With
this object in view, he packed his trunks, and took the first train for
Liverpool. Arrived in that town, he at once betook himself to the
docks, to examine the American shipping, when a new crotchet entered
his brain, born of his old sea reminiscences. It was to assume duck
browsers and tarpaulin, and gallantly cross the Atlantic as a sailor.
There was a dash of romance in it; a taking abandonment; and scorn of
fine coats, which exactly harmonized with his reckless contempt, at the
time, for all past conventionalities.

Thus determined, he exchanged his trunk for a mahogany chest; sold some
of his superfluities; and moved his quarters to the sign of the Gold
Anchor in Union-street.

After making his acquaintance, and learning his intentions, I was all
anxiety that Harry should accompany me home in the Highlander, a desire
to which he warmly responded.

Nor was I without strong hopes that he would succeed in an application
to the captain; inasmuch as during our stay in the docks, three of our
crew had left us, and their places would remain unsupplied till just
upon the eve of our departure.

And here, it may as well be related, that owing to the heavy charges to
which the American ships long staying in Liverpool are subjected, from
the obligation to continue the wages of their seamen, when they have
little or no work to employ them, and from the necessity of boarding
them ashore, like lords, at their leisure, captains interested in the
ownership of their vessels, are not at all indisposed to let their
sailors abscond, if they please, and thus forfeit their money; for they
well know that, when wanted, a new crew is easily to be procured,
through the crimps of the port.

Though he spake English with fluency, and from his long service in the
vessels of New York, was almost an American to behold, yet Captain Riga
was in fact a Russian by birth, though this was a fact that he strove
to conceal. And though extravagant in his personal expenses, and even
indulging in luxurious habits, costly as Oriental dissipation, yet
Captain Riga was a niggard to others; as, indeed, was evinced in the
magnificent stipend of three dollars, with which he requited my own
valuable services. Therefore, as it was agreed between Harry and me,
that he should offer to ship as a _“boy,”_ at the same rate of
compensation with myself, I made no doubt that, incited by the
cheapness of the bargain, Captain Riga would gladly close with him; and
thus, instead of paying sixteen dollars a month to a thorough-going
tar, who would consume all his rations, buy up my young blade of Bury,
at the rate of half a dollar a week; with the cheering prospect, that
by the end of the voyage, his fastidious palate would be the means of
leaving a handsome balance of salt beef and pork in the _harness-cask._

With part of the money obtained by the sale of a few of his velvet
vests, Harry, by my advice, now rigged himself in a Guernsey frock and
man-of-war browsers; and thus equipped, he made his appearance, one
fine morning, on the quarterdeck of the Highlander, gallantly doffing
his virgin tarpaulin before the redoubtable Riga.

No sooner were his wishes made known, than I perceived in the captain’s
face that same bland, benevolent, and bewitchingly merry expression,
that had so charmed, but deceived me, when, with Mr. Jones, I had first
accosted him in the cabin.

Alas, Harry! thought I,—as I stood upon the forecastle looking astern
where they stood,—that _“gallant, gay deceiver”_ shall not altogether
cajole you, if Wellingborough can help it. Rather than that should be
the case, indeed, I would forfeit the pleasure of your society across
the Atlantic.

At this interesting interview the captain expressed a sympathetic
concern touching the sad necessities, which he took upon himself to
presume must have driven Harry to sea; he confessed to a warm interest
in his future welfare; and did not hesitate to declare that, in going
to America, under such circumstances, to seek his fortune, he was
acting a manly and spirited part; and that the voyage thither, as a
sailor, would be an invigorating preparative to the landing upon a
shore, where he must battle out his fortune with Fate.

He engaged him at once; but was sorry to say, that he could not provide
him a home on board till the day previous to the sailing of the ship;
and during the interval, he could not honor any drafts upon the
strength of his wages.

However, glad enough to conclude the agreement upon any terms at all,
my young blade of Bury expressed his satisfaction; and full of
admiration at so urbane and gentlemanly a sea-captain, he came forward
to receive my congratulations.

“Harry,” said I, “be not deceived by the fascinating Riga—that gay
Lothario of all inexperienced, sea-going youths, from the capital or
the country; he has a Janus-face, Harry; and you will not know him when
he gets you out of sight of land, and mouths his cast-off coats and
browsers. For _then_ he is another personage altogether, and adjusts
his character to the shabbiness of his integuments. No more condolings
and sympathy then; no more blarney; he will hold you a little better
than his boots, and would no more think of addressing you than of
invoking wooden Donald, the figure-head on our bows.”

And I further admonished my friend concerning our crew, particularly of
the diabolical Jackson, and warned him to be cautious and wary. I told
him, that unless he was somewhat accustomed to the rigging, and could
furl a royal in a squall, he would be sure to subject himself to a sort
of treatment from the sailors, in the last degree ignominious to any
mortal who had ever crossed his legs under mahogany.

And I played the inquisitor, in cross-questioning Harry respecting the
precise degree in which he was a practical sailor;—whether he had a
giddy head; whether his arms could bear the weight of his body;
whether, with but one hand on a shroud, a hundred feet aloft in a
tempest, he felt he could look right to windward and beard it.

To all this, and much more, Harry rejoined with the most off-hand and
confident air; saying that in his _“guinea-pig”_ days, he had often
climbed the masts and handled the sails in a gentlemanly and amateur
way; so he made no doubt that he would very soon prove an expert
tumbler in the Highlander’s rigging.

His levity of manner, and sanguine assurance, coupled with the constant
sight of his most unseamanlike person—more suited to the Queen’s
drawing-room than a ship’s forecastle-bred many misgivings in my mind.
But after all, every one in this world has his own fate intrusted to
himself; and though we may warn, and forewarn, and give sage advice,
and indulge in many apprehensions touching our friends; yet our
friends, for the most part, will _“gang their ain gate;”_ and the most
we can do is, to hope for the best. Still, I suggested to Harry,
whether he had not best cross the sea as a steerage passenger, since he
could procure enough money for that; but no, he was bent upon going as
a sailor.

I now had a comrade in my afternoon strolls, and Sunday excursions; and
as Harry was a generous fellow, he shared with me his purse and his
heart. He sold off several more of his fine vests and browsers, his
silver-keyed flute and enameled guitar; and a portion of the money thus
furnished was pleasantly spent in refreshing ourselves at the road-side
inns in the vicinity of the town.

Reclining side by side in some agreeable nook, we exchanged our
experiences of the past. Harry enlarged upon the fascinations of a
London life; described the curricle he used to drive in Hyde Park; gave
me the measurement of Madame Vestris’ ankle; alluded to his first
introduction at a club to the madcap Marquis of Waterford; told over
the sums he had lost upon the turf on a Derby day; and made various but
enigmatical allusions to a certain Lady Georgiana Theresa, the noble
daughter of an anonymous earl.

Even in conversation, Harry was a prodigal; squandering his
aristocratic narrations with a careless hand; and, perhaps, sometimes
spending funds of reminiscences not his own.

As for me, I had only my poor old uncle the senator to fall back upon;
and I used him upon all emergencies, like the knight in the game of
chess; making him hop about, and stand stiffly up to the encounter,
against all my fine comrade’s array of dukes, lords, curricles, and
countesses.

In these long talks of ours, I frequently expressed the earnest desire
I cherished, to make a visit to London; and related how strongly
tempted I had been one Sunday, to walk the whole way, without a penny
in my pocket. To this, Harry rejoined, that nothing would delight him
more, than to show me the capital; and he even meaningly but
mysteriously hinted at the possibility of his doing so, before many
days had passed. But this seemed so idle a thought, that I only imputed
it to my friend’s good-natured, rattling disposition, which sometimes
prompted him to out with any thing, that he thought would be agreeable.
Besides, would this fine blade of Bury be seen, by his aristocratic
acquaintances, walking down Oxford-street, say, arm in arm with the
sleeve of my shooting-jacket? The thing was preposterous; and I began
to think, that Harry, after all, was a little bit disposed to impose
upon my Yankee credulity.

Luckily, my Bury blade had no acquaintance in Liverpool, where, indeed,
he was as much in a foreign land, as if he were already on the shores
of Lake Erie; so that he strolled about with me in perfect abandonment;
reckless of the cut of my shooting-jacket; and not caring one whit who
might stare at so singular a couple.

But once, crossing a square, faced on one side by a fashionable hotel,
he made a rapid turn with me round a corner; and never stopped, till
the square was a good block in our rear. The cause of this sudden
retreat, was a remarkably elegant coat and pantaloons, standing upright
on the hotel steps, and containing a young buck, tapping his teeth with
an ivory-headed riding-whip.

“Who was he, Harry?” said I.

“My old chum, Lord Lovely,” said Harry, with a careless air, “and
Heaven only knows what brings Lovely from London.”

“A lord?” said I starting; “then I must look at him again;” for lords
are very scarce in Liverpool.

Unmindful of my companion’s remonstrances, I ran back to the corner;
and slowly promenaded past the upright coat and pantaloons on the
steps.

It was not much of a lord to behold; very thin and limber about the
legs, with small feet like a doll’s, and a small, glossy head like a
seal’s. I had seen just such looking lords standing in sentimental
attitudes in front of Palmo’s in Broadway.

However, he and I being mutual friends of Harry’s, I thought something
of accosting him, and taking counsel concerning what was best to be
done for the young prodigal’s welfare; but upon second thoughts I
thought best not to intrude; especially, as just then my lord Lovely
stepped to the open window of a flashing carriage which drew up; and
throwing himself into an interesting posture, with the sole of one boot
vertically exposed, so as to show the stamp on it—a coronet—fell into a
sparkling conversation with a magnificent white satin hat, surmounted
by a regal marabou feather, inside.

I doubted not, this lady was nothing short of a peeress; and thought it
would be one of the pleasantest and most charming things in the world,
just to seat myself beside her, and order the coachman to take us a
drive into the country.

But, as upon further consideration, I imagined that the peeress might
decline the honor of my company, since I had no formal card of
introduction; I marched on, and rejoined my companion, whom I at once
endeavored to draw out, touching Lord Lovely; but he only made
mysterious answers; and turned off the conversation, by allusions to
his visits to Ickworth in Suffolk, the magnificent seat of the Most
Noble Marquis of Bristol, who had repeatedly assured Harry that he
might consider Ickworth his home.

Now, all these accounts of marquises and Ickworths, and Harry’s having
been hand in glove with so many lords and ladies, began to breed some
suspicions concerning the rigid morality of my friend, as a teller of
the truth. But, after all, thought I to myself, who can prove that
Harry has fibbed? Certainly, his manners are polished, he has a mighty
easy address; and there is nothing altogether impossible about his
having consorted with the master of Ickworth, and the daughter of the
anonymous earl. And what right has a poor Yankee, like me, to insinuate
the slightest suspicion against what he says? What little money he has,
he spends freely; he can not be a polite blackleg, for I am no pigeon
to pluck; so _that_ is out of the question;—perish such a thought,
concerning my own bosom friend!

But though I drowned all my suspicions as well as I could, and ever
cherished toward Harry a heart, loving and true; yet, spite of all
this, I never could entirely digest some of his imperial reminiscences
of high life. I was very sorry for this; as at times it made me feel
ill at ease in his company; and made me hold back my whole soul from
him; when, in its loneliness, it was yearning to throw itself into the
unbounded bosom of some immaculate friend.




CHAPTER XLV.
HARRY BOLTON KIDNAPS REDBURN, AND CARRIES HIM OFF TO LONDON


It might have been a week after our glimpse of Lord Lovely, that Harry,
who had been expecting a letter, which, he told me, might possibly
alter his plans, one afternoon came bounding on board the ship, and
sprang down the hatchway into the _between-decks,_ where, in perfect
solitude, I was engaged picking oakum; at which business the mate had
set me, for want of any thing better.

“Hey for London, Wellingborough!” he cried. “Off tomorrow! first
train—be there the same night—come! I have money to rig you all
out—drop that hangman’s stuff there, and away! Pah! how it smells here!
Come; up you jump!”

I trembled with amazement and delight.

London? it could not be!—and Harry—how kind of him! he was then indeed
what he seemed. But instantly I thought of all the circumstances of the
case, and was eager to know what it was that had induced this sudden
departure.

In reply my friend told me, that he had received a remittance, and had
hopes of recovering a considerable sum, lost in some way that he chose
to conceal.

“But how am I to leave the ship, Harry?” said I; “they will not let me
go, will they? You had better leave me behind, after all; I don’t care
very much about going; and besides, I have no money to share the
expenses.”

This I said, only pretending indifference, for my heart was jumping all
the time.

“Tut! my Yankee bantam,” said Harry; “look here!” and he showed me a
handful of gold.

“But they are _yours,_ and not _mine,_ Harry,” said I.

“Yours _and_ mine, my sweet fellow,” exclaimed Harry. “Come, sink the
ship, and let’s go!”

“But you don’t consider, if I quit the ship, they’ll be sending a
constable after me, won’t they?”

“What! and do you think, then, they value your services so highly? Ha!
ha!-Up, up, Wellingborough: I can’t wait.”

True enough. I well knew that Captain Riga would not trouble himself
much, if I _did_ take French leave of him. So, without further thought
of the matter, I told Harry to wait a few moments, till the ship’s bell
struck four; at which time I used to go to supper, and be free for the
rest of the day.

The bell struck; and off we went. As we hurried across the quay, and
along the dock walls, I asked Harry all about his intentions. He said,
that go to London he must, and to Bury St. Edmunds; but that whether he
should for any time remain at either place, he could not now tell; and
it was by no means impossible, that in less than a week’s time we would
be back again in Liverpool, and ready for sea. But all he said was
enveloped in a mystery that I did not much like; and I hardly know
whether I have repeated correctly what he said at the time.

Arrived at the _Golden Anchor,_ where Harry put up, he at once led me
to his room, and began turning over the contents of his chest, to see
what clothing he might have, that would fit me.

Though he was some years my senior, we were about the same size—if any
thing, I was larger than he; so, with a little stretching, a shirt,
vest, and pantaloons were soon found to suit. As for a coat and hat,
those Harry ran out and bought without delay; returning with a loose,
stylish sack-coat, and a sort of foraging cap, very neat, genteel, and
unpretending.

My friend himself soon doffed his Guernsey frock, and stood before me,
arrayed in a perfectly plain suit, which he had bought on purpose that
very morning. I asked him why he had gone to that unnecessary expense,
when he had plenty of other clothes in his chest. But he only winked,
and looked knowing. This, again, I did not like. But I strove to drown
ugly thoughts.

Till quite dark, we sat talking together; when, locking his chest, and
charging his landlady to look after it well, till he called, or sent
for it; Harry seized my arm, and we sallied into the street.

Pursuing our way through crowds of frolicking sailors and fiddlers, we
turned into a street leading to the Exchange. There, under the shadow
of the colonnade, Harry told me to stop, while he left me, and went to
finish his toilet. Wondering what he meant, I stood to one side; and
presently was joined by a stranger in whiskers and mustache.

“It’s _me”_ said the stranger; and who was _me_ but Harry, who had thus
metamorphosed himself? I asked him the reason; and in a faltering
voice, which I tried to make humorous, expressed a hope that he was not
going to turn gentleman forger.

He laughed, and assured me that it was only a precaution against being
recognized by his own particular friends in London, that he had adopted
this mode of disguising himself.

“And why afraid of your friends?” asked I, in astonishment, “and we are
not in London yet.”

“Pshaw! what a Yankee you are, Wellingborough. Can’t you see very
plainly that I have a plan in my head? And this disguise is only for a
short time, you know. But I’ll tell you all by and by.”

I acquiesced, though not feeling at ease; and we walked on, till we
came to a public house, in the vicinity of the place at which the cars
are taken.

We stopped there that night, and next day were off, whirled along
through boundless landscapes of villages, and meadows, and parks: and
over arching viaducts, and through wonderful tunnels; till, half
delirious with excitement, I found myself dropped down in the evening
among gas-lights, under a great roof in Euston Square.

London at last, and in the West-End!




CHAPTER XLVI.
A MYSTERIOUS NIGHT IN LONDON


“No time to lose,” said Harry, “come along.”

He called a cab: in an undertone mentioned the number of a house in
some street to the driver; we jumped in, and were off.

As we rattled over the boisterous pavements, past splendid squares,
churches, and shops, our cabman turning corners like a skater on the
ice, and all the roar of London in my ears, and no end to the walls of
brick and mortar; I thought New York a hamlet, and Liverpool a
coal-hole, and myself somebody else: so unreal seemed every thing about
me. My head was spinning round like a top, and my eyes ached with much
gazing; particularly about the corners, owing to my darting them so
rapidly, first this side, and then that, so as not to miss any thing;
though, in truth, I missed much.

“Stop,” cried Harry, after a long while, putting his head out of the
window, all at once—“stop! do you hear, you deaf man? you have passed
the house—No. 40 I told you—that’s it—the high steps there, with the
purple light!”

The cabman being paid, Harry adjusting his whiskers and mustache, and
bidding me assume a lounging look, pushed his hat a little to one side,
and then locking arms, we sauntered into the house; myself feeling not
a little abashed; it was so long since I had been in any courtly
society.

It was some semi-public place of opulent entertainment; and far
surpassed any thing of the kind I had ever seen before.

The floor was tesselated with snow-white, and russet-hued marbles; and
echoed to the tread, as if all the Paris catacombs were underneath. I
started with misgivings at that hollow, boding sound, which seemed
sighing with a subterraneous despair, through all the magnificent
spectacle around me; mocking it, where most it glared.

The walls were painted so as to deceive the eye with interminable
colonnades; and groups of columns of the finest Scagliola work of
variegated marbles—emerald-green and gold, St. Pons veined with silver,
Sienna with porphyry—supported a resplendent fresco ceiling, arched
like a bower, and thickly clustering with mimic grapes. Through all the
East of this foliage, you spied in a crimson dawn, Guide’s ever
youthful Apollo, driving forth the horses of the sun. From sculptured
stalactites of vine-boughs, here and there pendent hung galaxies of gas
lights, whose vivid glare was softened by pale, cream-colored,
porcelain spheres, shedding over the place a serene, silver flood; as
if every porcelain sphere were a moon; and this superb apartment was
the moon-lit garden of Portia at Belmont; and the gentle lovers,
Lorenzo and Jessica, lurked somewhere among the vines.

At numerous Moorish looking tables, supported by Caryatides of turbaned
slaves, sat knots of gentlemanly men, with cut decanters and
taper-waisted glasses, journals and cigars, before them.

To and fro ran obsequious waiters, with spotless napkins thrown over
their arms, and making a profound salaam, and hemming deferentially,
whenever they uttered a word.

At the further end of this brilliant apartment, was a rich mahogany
turret-like structure, partly built into the wall, and communicating
with rooms in the rear. Behind, was a very handsome florid old man,
with snow-white hair and whiskers, and in a snow-white jacket—he looked
like an almond tree in blossom—who seemed to be standing, a polite
sentry over the scene before him; and it was he, who mostly ordered
about the waiters; and with a silent salute, received the silver of the
guests.

Our entrance excited little or no notice; for every body present seemed
exceedingly animated about concerns of their own; and a large group was
gathered around one tall, military looking gentleman, who was reading
some India war-news from the Times, and commenting on it, in a very
loud voice, condemning, in toto, the entire campaign.

We seated ourselves apart from this group, and Harry, rapping on the
table, called for wine; mentioning some curious foreign name.

The decanter, filled with a pale yellow wine, being placed before us,
and my comrade having drunk a few glasses; he whispered me to remain
where I was, while he withdrew for a moment.

I saw him advance to the turret-like place, and exchange a confidential
word with the almond tree there, who immediately looked very much
surprised,—I thought, a little disconcerted,—and then disappeared with
him.

While my friend was gone, I occupied myself with looking around me, and
striving to appear as indifferent as possible, and as much used to all
this splendor as if I had been born in it. But, to tell the truth, my
head was almost dizzy with the strangeness of the sight, and the
thought that I was really in London. What would my brother have said?
What would Tom Legare, the treasurer of the Juvenile Temperance
Society, have thought?

But I almost began to fancy I had no friends and relatives living in a
little village three thousand five hundred miles off, in America; for
it was hard to unite such a humble reminiscence with the splendid
animation of the London-like scene around me.

And in the delirium of the moment, I began to indulge in foolish golden
visions of the counts and countesses to whom Harry might introduce me;
and every instant I expected to hear the waiters addressing some
gentleman as _“My Lord,”_ or _“four Grace.”_ But if there were really
any lords present, the waiters omitted their titles, at least in my
hearing.

Mixed with these thoughts were confused visions of St. Paul’s and the
Strand, which I determined to visit the very next morning, before
breakfast, or perish in the attempt. And I even longed for Harry’s
return, that we might immediately sally out into the street, and see
some of the sights, before the shops were all closed for the night.

While I thus sat alone, I observed one of the waiters eying me a little
impertinently, as I thought, and as if he saw something queer about me.
So I tried to assume a careless and lordly air, and by way of helping
the thing, threw one leg over the other, like a young Prince Esterhazy;
but all the time I felt my face burning with embarrassment, and for the
time, I must have looked very guilty of something. But spite of this, I
kept looking boldly out of my eyes, and straight through my blushes,
and observed that every now and then little parties were made up among
the gentlemen, and they retired into the rear of the house, as if going
to a private apartment. And I overheard one of them drop the word
_Rouge;_ but he could not have used rouge, for his face was exceedingly
pale. Another said something about _Loo._

At last Harry came back, his face rather flushed.

“Come along, Redburn,” said he.

So making no doubt we were off for a ramble, perhaps to Apsley House,
in the Park, to get a sly peep at the old Duke before he retired for
the night, for Harry had told me the Duke always went to bed early, I
sprang up to follow him; but what was my disappointment and surprise,
when he only led me into the passage, toward a staircase lighted by
three marble Graces, unitedly holding a broad candelabra, like an elk’s
antlers, over the landing.

We rambled up the long, winding slope of those aristocratic stairs,
every step of which, covered with Turkey rugs, looked gorgeous as the
hammer-cloth of the Lord Mayor’s coach; and Harry hied straight to a
rosewood door, which, on magical hinges, sprang softly open to his
touch.

As we entered the room, methought I was slowly sinking in some
reluctant, sedgy sea; so thick and elastic the Persian carpeting,
mimicking parterres of tulips, and roses, and jonquils, like a bower in
Babylon.

Long lounges lay carelessly disposed, whose fine damask was interwoven,
like the Gobelin tapestry, with pictorial tales of tilt and tourney.
And oriental ottomans, whose cunning warp and woof were wrought into
plaited serpents, undulating beneath beds of leaves, from which, here
and there, they flashed out sudden splendors of green scales and gold.

In the broad bay windows, as the hollows of King Charles’ oaks, were
Laocoon-like chairs, in the antique taste, draped with heavy fringes of
bullion and silk.

The walls, covered with a sort of tartan-French paper, variegated with
bars of velvet, were hung round with mythological oil-paintings,
suspended by tasseled cords of twisted silver and blue.

They were such pictures as the high-priests, for a bribe, showed to
Alexander in the innermost shrine of the white temple in the Libyan
oasis: such pictures as the pontiff of the sun strove to hide from
Cortez, when, sword in hand, he burst open the sanctorum of the
pyramid-fane at Cholula: such pictures as you may still see, perhaps,
in the central alcove of the excavated mansion of Pansa, in Pompeii—in
that part of it called by Varro _the hollow of the house:_ such
pictures as Martial and Seutonius mention as being found in the private
cabinet of the Emperor Tiberius: such pictures as are delineated on the
bronze medals, to this day dug up on the ancient island of Capreas:
such pictures as you might have beheld in an arched recess, leading
from the left hand of the secret side-gallery of the temple of
Aphrodite in Corinth.

In the principal pier was a marble bracket, sculptured in the semblance
of a dragon’s crest, and supporting a bust, most wonderful to behold.
It was that of a bald-headed old man, with a mysteriously-wicked
expression, and imposing silence by one thin finger over his lips. His
marble mouth seemed tremulous with secrets.

“Sit down, Wellingborough,” said Harry; “don’t be frightened, we are at
home.—Ring the bell, will you? But stop;”— and advancing to the
mysterious bust, he whispered something in its ear.

“He’s a knowing mute, Wellingborough,” said he; “who stays in this one
place all the time, while he is yet running of errands. But mind you
don’t breathe any secrets in his ear.”

In obedience to a summons so singularly conveyed, to my amazement a
servant almost instantly appeared, standing transfixed in the attitude
of a bow.

“Cigars,” said Harry. When they came, he drew up a small table into the
middle of the room, and lighting his cigar, bade me follow his example,
and make myself happy.

Almost transported with such princely quarters, so undreamed of before,
while leading my dog’s life in the filthy forecastle of the Highlander,
I twirled round a chair, and seated myself opposite my friend.

But all the time, I felt ill at heart; and was filled with an
undercurrent of dismal forebodings. But I strove to dispel them; and
turning to my companion, exclaimed, “And pray, do you live here, Harry,
in this Palace of Aladdin?”

“Upon my soul,” he cried, “you have hit it:—you must have been here
before! Aladdin’s Palace! Why, Wellingborough, it goes by that very
name.”

Then he laughed strangely: and for the first time, I thought he had
been quaffing too freely: yet, though he looked wildly from his eyes,
his general carriage was firm.

“Who are you looking at so hard, Wellingborough?” said he.

“I am afraid, Harry,” said I, “that when you left me just now, you must
have been drinking something stronger than wine.”

“Hear him now,” said Harry, turning round, as if addressing the
bald-headed bust on the bracket,—“a parson ’pon honor!—But remark you,
Wellingborough, my boy, I must leave you again, and for a considerably
longer time than before:—I may not be back again to-night.”

“What?” said I.

“Be still,” he cried, “hear me, I know the old duke here, and—”

“Who? not the Duke of Wellington,” said I, wondering whether Harry was
really going to include _him_ too, in his long list of confidential
friends and acquaintances.

“Pooh!” cried Harry, “I mean the white-whiskered old man you saw below;
they call him _the Duke:—he_ keeps the house. I say, I know him well,
and he knows _me;_ and he knows what brings me here, also. Well; we
have arranged every thing about you; you are to stay in this room, and
sleep here tonight, and—and—” continued he, speaking low—“you must
guard this letter—” slipping a sealed one into my hand—“and, if I am
not back by morning, you must post right on to Bury, and leave the
letter there;—here, take this paper—it’s all set down here in black and
white—where you are to go, and what you are to do. And after that’s
done—mind, this is all in case I don’t return—then you may do what you
please: stay here in London awhile, or go back to Liverpool. And here’s
enough to pay all your expenses.”

All this was a thunder stroke. I thought Harry was crazy. I held the
purse in my motionless hand, and stared at him, till the tears almost
started from my eyes.

“What’s the matter, Redburn?” he cried, with a wild sort of laugh—“you
are not afraid of me, are you?—No, no! I believe in you, my boy, or you
would not hold that purse in your hand; no, nor that letter.”

“What in heaven’s name do you mean?” at last I exclaimed, “you don’t
really intend to desert me in this strange place, do you, Harry?” and I
snatched him by the hand.

“Pooh, pooh,” he cried, “let me go. I tell you, it’s all right: do as I
say: that’s all. Promise me now, will you? Swear it!—no, no,” he added,
vehemently, as I conjured him to tell me more—“no, I won’t: I have
nothing more to tell you—not a word. Will you swear?”

“But one sentence more for your own sake, Harry: hear me!”

“Not a syllable! Will you swear?—you will not? then here, give me that
purse:—there—there—take that—and that—and that;—that will pay your fare
back to Liverpool; good-by to you: you are not my friend,” and he
wheeled round his back.

I know not what flashed through my mind, but something suddenly
impelled me; and grasping his hand, I swore to him what he demanded.

Immediately he ran to the bust, whispered a word, and the
white-whiskered old man appeared: whom he clapped on the shoulder, and
then introduced me as his friend—young Lord Stormont; and bade the
almond tree look well to the comforts of his lordship, while
he—Harry—was gone.

The almond tree blandly bowed, and grimaced, with a peculiar
expression, that I hated on the spot. After a few words more, he
withdrew. Harry then shook my hand heartily, and without giving me a
chance to say one word, seized his cap, and darted out of the room,
saying, “Leave not this room tonight; and remember the letter, and
Bury!”

I fell into a chair, and gazed round at the strange-looking walls and
mysterious pictures, and up to the chandelier at the ceiling; then
rose, and opened the door, and looked down the lighted passage; but
only heard the hum from the roomful below, scattered voices, and a
hushed ivory rattling from the closed apartments adjoining. I stepped
back into the room, and a terrible revulsion came over me: I would have
given the world had I been safe back in Liverpool, fast asleep in my
old bunk in Prince’s Dock.

I shuddered at every footfall, and almost thought it must be some
assassin pursuing me. The whole place seemed infected; and a strange
thought came over me, that in the very damasks around, some eastern
plague had been imported. And was that pale yellow wine, that I drank
below, drugged? thought I. This must be some house whose foundations
take hold on the pit. But these fearful reveries only enchanted me fast
to my chair; so that, though I then wished to rush forth from the
house, my limbs seemed manacled.

While thus chained to my seat, something seemed suddenly flung open; a
confused sound of imprecations, mixed with the ivory rattling, louder
than before, burst upon my ear, and through the partly open door of the
room where I was, I caught sight of a tall, frantic man, with clenched
hands, wildly darting through the passage, toward the stairs.

And all the while, Harry ran through my soul—in and out, at every door,
that burst open to his vehement rush.

At that moment my whole acquaintance with him passed like lightning
through my mind, till I asked myself why he had come here, to London,
to do this thing?—why would not Liverpool have answered? and what did
he want of me? But, every way, his conduct was unaccountable. From the
hour he had accosted me on board the ship, his manner seemed gradually
changed; and from the moment we had sprung into the cab, he had seemed
almost another person from what he had seemed before.

But what could I do? He was gone, that was certain;—would he ever come
back? But he might still be somewhere in the house; and with a shudder,
I thought of that ivory rattling, and was almost ready to dart forth,
search every room, and save him. But that would be madness, and I had
sworn not to do so. There seemed nothing left, but to await his return.
Yet, if he did not return, what then? I took out the purse, and counted
over the money, and looked at the letter and paper of memoranda.

Though I vividly remember it all, I will not give the superscription of
the letter, nor the contents of the paper. But after I had looked at
them attentively, and considered that Harry could have no conceivable
object in deceiving me, I thought to myself, Yes, he’s in earnest; and
here I am—yes, even in London! And here in this room will I stay, come
what will. I will implicitly follow his directions, and so see out the
last of this thing.

But spite of these thoughts, and spite of the metropolitan magnificence
around me, I was mysteriously alive to a dreadful feeling, which I had
never before felt, except when penetrating into the lowest and most
squalid haunts of sailor iniquity in Liverpool. All the mirrors and
marbles around me seemed crawling over with lizards; and I thought to
myself, that though gilded and golden, the serpent of vice is a serpent
still.

It was now grown very late; and faint with excitement, I threw myself
upon a lounge; but for some time tossed about restless, in a sort of
night-mare. Every few moments, spite of my oath, I was upon the point
of starting up, and rushing into the street, to inquire where I was;
but remembering Harry’s injunctions, and my own ignorance of the town,
and that it was now so late, I again tried to be composed.

At last, I fell asleep, dreaming about Harry fighting a duel of
dice-boxes with the military-looking man below; and the next thing I
knew, was the glare of a light before my eyes, and Harry himself, very
pale, stood before me.

“The letter and paper,” he cried.

I fumbled in my pockets, and handed them to him.

“There! there! there! thus I tear you,” he cried, wrenching the letter
to pieces with both hands like a madman, and stamping upon the
fragments. “I am off for America; the game is up.”

“For God’s sake explain,” said I, now utterly bewildered, and
frightened. “Tell me, Harry, what is it? You have not been gambling?”

“Ha, ha,” he deliriously laughed. “Gambling? red and white, you
mean?—cards?—dice?—the bones?—Ha, ha!—Gambling? gambling?” he ground
out between his teeth—“what two devilish, stiletto-sounding syllables
they are!”

“Wellingborough,” he added, marching up to me slowly, but with his eyes
blazing into mine—“Wellingborough”—and fumbling in his breast-pocket,
he drew forth a dirk—“Here, Wellingborough, take it—take it, I say—are
you stupid?—there, there”—and he pushed it into my hands. “Keep it away
from me—keep it out of my sight—I don’t want it near me, while I feel
as I do. They serve suicides scurvily here, Wellingborough; they don’t
bury them decently. See that bell-rope! By Heaven, it’s an invitation
to hang myself"—and seizing it by the gilded handle at the end, he
twitched it down from the wall.

“In God’s name, what ails you?” I cried.

“Nothing, oh nothing,” said Harry, now assuming a treacherous, tropical
calmness—“nothing, Redburn; nothing in the world. I’m the serenest of
men.”

“But give me that dirk,” he suddenly cried—“let me have it, I say. Oh!
I don’t mean to murder myself—I’m past that now—give it me”—and
snatching it from my hand, he flung down an empty purse, and with a
terrific stab, nailed it fast with the dirk to the table.

“There now,” he cried, “there’s something for the old duke to see
to-morrow morning; that’s about all that’s left of me— that’s my
skeleton, Wellingborough. But come, don’t be downhearted; there’s a
little more gold yet in Golconda; I have a guinea or two left. Don’t
stare so, my boy; we shall be in Liverpool to-morrow night; we start in
the morning”—and turning his back, he began to whistle very fiercely.

“And this, then,” said I, “is your showing me London, is it, Harry? I
did not think this; but tell me your secret, whatever it is, and I will
not regret not seeing the town.”

He turned round upon me like lightning, and cried, “Red-burn! you must
swear another oath, and instantly.”

“And why?” said I, in alarm, “what more would you have me swear?”

“Never to question me again about this infernal trip to London!” he
shouted, with the foam at his lips—“never to breathe it! swear!”

“I certainly shall not trouble you, Harry, with questions, if you do
not desire it,” said I, “but there’s no need of swearing.”

“Swear it, I say, as you love me, Redburn,” he added, imploringly.

“Well, then, I solemnly do. Now lie down, and let us forget ourselves
as soon as we can; for me, you have made me the most miserable dog
alive.”

“And what am I?” cried Harry; “but pardon me, Redburn, I did not mean
to offend; if you knew all—but no, no!—never mind, never mind!” And he
ran to the bust, and whispered in its ear. A waiter came.

“Brandy,” whispered Harry, with clenched teeth.

“Are you not going to sleep, then?” said I, more and more alarmed at
his wildness, and fearful of the effects of his drinking still more, in
such a mood.

“No sleep for me! sleep if _you_ can—I mean to sit up with a
decanter!—let me see”—looking at the ormolu clock on the mantel—“it’s
only two hours to morning.”

The waiter, looking very sleepy, and with a green shade on his brow,
appeared with the decanter and glasses on a salver, and was told to
leave it and depart.

Seeing that Harry was not to be moved, I once more threw myself on the
lounge. I did not sleep; but, like a somnambulist, only dozed now and
then; starting from my dreams; while Harry sat, with his hat on, at the
table; the brandy before him; from which he occasionally poured into
his glass. Instead of exciting him, however, to my amazement, the
spirits seemed to soothe him down; and, ere long, he was comparatively
calm.

At last, just as I had fallen into a deep sleep, I was wakened by his
shaking me, and saying our cab was at the door.

“Look! it is broad day,” said he, brushing aside the heavy hangings of
the window.

We left the room; and passing through the now silent and deserted hall
of pillars, which, at this hour, reeked as with blended roses and
cigar-stumps decayed; a dumb waiter; rubbing his eyes, flung open the
street door; we sprang into the cab; and soon found ourselves whirled
along northward by railroad, toward Prince’s Dock and the Highlander.




CHAPTER XLVII.
HOMEWARD BOUND


Once more in Liverpool; and wending my way through the same old streets
to the sign of the Golden Anchor; I could scarcely credit the events of
the last thirty-six hours.

So unforeseen had been our departure in the first place; so rapid our
journey; so unaccountable the conduct of Harry; and so sudden our
return; that all united to overwhelm me. That I had been at all in
London seemed impossible; and that I had been there, and come away
little the wiser, was almost distracting to one who, like me, had so
longed to behold that metropolis of marvels.

I looked hard at Harry as he walked in silence at my side; I stared at
the houses we passed; I thought of the cab, the gas lighted hall in the
Palace of Aladdin, the pictures, the letter, the oath, the dirk; the
mysterious place where all these mysteries had occurred; and then, was
almost ready to conclude, that the pale yellow wine had been drugged.

As for Harry, stuffing his false whiskers and mustache into his pocket,
he now led the way to the boarding-house; and saluting the landlady,
was shown to his room; where we immediately shifted our clothes,
appearing once more in our sailor habiliments.

“Well, what do you propose to do now, Harry?” said I, with a heavy
heart.

“Why, visit your Yankee land in the Highlander, of course—what else?"
he replied.

“And is it to be a visit, or a long stay?” asked I.

“That’s as it may turn out,” said Harry; “but I have now more than ever
resolved upon the sea. There is nothing like the sea for a fellow like
me, Redburn; a desperate man can not get any further than the wharf,
you know; and the next step must be a long jump. But come, let’s see
what they have to eat here, and then for a cigar and a stroll. I feel
better already. Never say die, is my motto.”

We went to supper; after that, sallied out; and walking along the quay
of Prince’s Dock, heard that the ship Highlander had that morning been
advertised to sail in two days’ time.

“Good!” exclaimed Harry; and I was glad enough myself.

Although I had now been absent from the ship a full forty-eight hours,
and intended to return to her, yet I did not anticipate being called to
any severe account for it from the officers; for several of our men had
absented themselves longer than I had, and upon their return, little or
nothing was said to them. Indeed, in some cases, the mate seemed to
know nothing about it. During the whole time we lay in Liverpool, the
discipline of the ship was altogether relaxed; and I could hardly
believe they were the same officers who were so dictatorial at sea. The
reason of this was, that we had nothing important to do; and although
the captain might now legally refuse to receive me on board, yet I was
not afraid of that, as I was as stout a lad for my years, and worked as
cheap, as any one he could engage to take my place on the homeward
passage.

Next morning we made our appearance on board before the rest of the
crew; and the mate perceiving me, said with an oath, “Well, sir, you
have thought best to return then, have you? Captain Riga and I were
flattering ourselves that you had made a run of it for good.”

Then, thought I, the captain, who seems to affect to know nothing of
the proceedings of the sailors, has been aware of my absence.

“But turn to, sir, turn to,” added the mate; “here! aloft there, and
free that pennant; it’s foul of the backstay—jump!”

The captain coming on board soon after, looked very benevolently at
Harry; but, as usual, pretended not to take the slightest notice of
myself.

We were all now very busy in getting things ready for sea. The cargo
had been already stowed in the hold by the stevedores and lumpers from
shore; but it became the crew’s business to clear away the
_between-decks,_ extending from the cabin bulkhead to the forecastle,
for the reception of about five hundred emigrants, some of whose boxes
were already littering the decks.

To provide for their wants, a far larger supply of water was needed
than upon the outward-bound passage. Accordingly, besides the usual
number of casks on deck, rows of immense tierces were lashed
amid-ships, all along the _between-decks,_ forming a sort of aisle on
each side, furnishing access to four rows of bunks,—three tiers, one
above another,—against the ship’s sides; two tiers being placed over
the tierces of water in the middle. These bunks were rapidly knocked
together with coarse planks. They looked more like dog-kennels than any
thing else; especially as the place was so gloomy and dark; no light
coming down except through the fore and after hatchways, both of which
were covered with little houses called _“booby-hatches.”_ Upon the
main-hatches, which were well calked and covered over with heavy
tarpaulins, the _“passengers-galley”_ was solidly lashed down.

This _galley_ was a large open stove, or iron range—made expressly for
emigrant ships, wholly unprotected from the weather, and where alone
the emigrants are permitted to cook their food while at sea.

After two days’ work, every thing was in readiness; most of the
emigrants on board; and in the evening we worked the ship close into
the outlet of Prince’s Dock, with the bow against the water-gate, to go
out with the tide in the morning.

In the morning, the bustle and confusion about us was indescribable.
Added to the ordinary clamor of the docks, was the hurrying to and fro
of our five hundred emigrants, the last of whom, with their baggage,
were now coming on board; the appearance of the cabin passengers,
following porters with their trunks; the loud orders of the
dock-masters, ordering the various ships behind us to preserve their
order of going out; the leave-takings, and good-by’s, and
God-bless-you’s, between the emigrants and their friends; and the
cheers of the surrounding ships.

At this time we lay in such a way, that no one could board us except by
the bowsprit, which overhung the quay. Staggering along that bowsprit,
now came a one-eyed _crimp_ leading a drunken tar by the collar, who
had been shipped to sail with us the day previous. It has been stated
before, that two or three of our men had left us for good, while in
port. When the crimp had got this man and another safely lodged in a
bunk below, he returned on shore; and going to a miserable cab, pulled
out still another apparently drunken fellow, who proved completely
helpless. However, the ship now swinging her broadside more toward the
quay, this stupefied sailor, with a Scotch cap pulled down over his
closed eyes, only revealing a sallow Portuguese complexion, was lowered
on board by a rope under his arms, and passed forward by the crew, who
put him likewise into a bunk in the forecastle, the crimp himself
carefully tucking him in, and bidding the bystanders not to disturb him
till the ship was away from the land.

This done, the confusion increased, as we now glided out of the dock.
Hats and handkerchiefs were waved; hurrahs were exchanged; and tears
were shed; and the last thing I saw, as we shot into the stream, was a
policeman collaring a boy, and walking him off to the guard-house.

A steam-tug, the _Goliath,_ now took us by the arm, and gallanted us
down the river past the fort.

The scene was most striking.

Owing to a strong breeze, which had been blowing up the river for four
days past, holding wind-bound in the various docks a multitude of ships
for all parts of the world; there was now under weigh, a vast fleet of
merchantmen, all steering broad out to sea. The white sails glistened
in the clear morning air like a great Eastern encampment of sultans;
and from many a forecastle, came the deep mellow old song _Ho-o-he-yo,
cheerily men!_ as the crews called their anchors.

The wind was fair; the weather mild; the sea most smooth; and the poor
emigrants were in high spirits at so auspicious a beginning of their
voyage. They were reclining all over the decks, talking of soon seeing
America, and relating how the agent had told them, that twenty days
would be an uncommonly long voyage.

Here it must be mentioned, that owing to the great number of ships
sailing to the Yankee ports from Liverpool, the competition among them
in obtaining emigrant passengers, who as a cargo are much more
remunerative than crates and bales, is exceedingly great; so much so,
that some of the agents they employ, do not scruple to deceive the poor
applicants for passage, with all manner of fables concerning the short
space of time, in which their ships make the run across the ocean.

This often induces the emigrants to provide a much smaller stock of
provisions than they otherwise would; the effect of which sometimes
proves to be in the last degree lamentable; as will be seen further on.
And though benevolent societies have been long organized in Liverpool,
for the purpose of keeping offices, where the emigrants can obtain
reliable information and advice, concerning their best mode of
embarkation, and other matters interesting to them; and though the
English authorities have imposed a law, providing that every captain of
an emigrant ship bound for any port of America shall see to it, that
each passenger is provided with rations of food for sixty days; yet,
all this has not deterred mercenary ship-masters and unprincipled
agents from practicing the grossest deception; nor exempted the
emigrants themselves, from the very sufferings intended to be averted.

No sooner had we fairly gained the expanse of the Irish Sea, and, one
by one, lost sight of our thousand consorts, than the weather changed
into the most miserable cold, wet, and cheerless days and nights
imaginable. The wind was tempestuous, and dead in our teeth; and the
hearts of the emigrants fell. Nearly all of them had now hied below, to
escape the uncomfortable and perilous decks: and from the two
_“booby-hatches”_ came the steady hum of a subterranean wailing and
weeping. That irresistible wrestler, sea-sickness, had overthrown the
stoutest of their number, and the women and children were embracing and
sobbing in all the agonies of the poor emigrant’s first storm at sea.

Bad enough is it at such times with ladies and gentlemen in the cabin,
who have nice little state-rooms; and plenty of privacy; and stewards
to run for them at a word, and put pillows under their heads, and
tenderly inquire how they are getting along, and mix them a posset: and
even then, in the abandonment of this soul and body subduing malady,
such ladies and gentlemen will often give up life itself as
unendurable, and put up the most pressing petitions for a speedy
annihilation; all of which, however, only arises from their intense
anxiety to preserve their valuable lives.

How, then, with the friendless emigrants, stowed away like bales of
cotton, and packed like slaves in a slave-ship; confined in a place
that, during storm time, must be closed against both light and air; who
can do no cooking, nor warm so much as a cup of water; for the
drenching seas would instantly flood their fire in their exposed galley
on deck? How, then, with these men, and women, and children, to whom a
first voyage, under the most advantageous circumstances, must come just
as hard as to the Honorable De Lancey Fitz Clarence, lady, daughter,
and seventeen servants.

Nor is this all: for in some of these ships, as in the case of the
Highlander, the emigrant passengers are cut off from the most
indispensable conveniences of a civilized dwelling. This forces them in
storm time to such extremities, that no wonder fevers and plagues are
the result. We had not been at sea one week, when to hold your head
down the fore hatchway was like holding it down a suddenly opened
cesspool.

But still more than this. Such is the aristocracy maintained on board
some of these ships, that the most arbitrary measures are enforced, to
prevent the emigrants from intruding upon the most holy precincts of
the quarter-deck, the only completely open space on ship-board.
Consequently—even in fine weather—when they come up from below, they
are crowded in the waist of the ship, and jammed among the boats,
casks, and spars; abused by the seamen, and sometimes cuffed by the
officers, for unavoidably standing in the way of working the vessel.

The cabin-passengers of the Highlander numbered some fifteen in all;
and to protect this detachment of gentility from the barbarian
incursions of the _“wild Irish”_ emigrants, ropes were passed
athwart-ships, by the main-mast, from side to side: which defined the
boundary line between those who had paid three pounds passage-money,
from those who had paid twenty guineas. And the cabin-passengers
themselves were the most urgent in having this regulation maintained.

Lucky would it be for the pretensions of some parvenus, whose souls are
deposited at their banker’s, and whose bodies but serve to carry about
purses, knit of poor men’s heartstrings, if thus easily they could
precisely define, ashore, the difference between them and the rest of
humanity.

But, I, Redburn, am a poor fellow, who have hardly ever known what it
is to have five silver dollars in my pocket at one time; so, no doubt,
this circumstance has something to do with my slight and harmless
indignation at these things.




CHAPTER XLVIII.
A LIVING CORPSE


It was destined that our departure from the English strand, should be
marked by a tragical event, akin to the sudden end of the suicide,
which had so strongly impressed me on quitting the American shore.

Of the three newly shipped men, who in a state of intoxication had been
brought on board at the dock gates, two were able to be engaged at
their duties, in four or five hours after quitting the pier. But the
third man yet lay in his bunk, in the self-same posture in which his
limbs had been adjusted by the crimp, who had deposited him there.

His name was down on the ship’s papers as Miguel Saveda, and for Miguel
Saveda the chief mate at last came forward, shouting down the
forecastle-scuttle, and commanding his instant presence on deck. But
the sailors answered for their new comrade; giving the mate to
understand that Miguel was still fast locked in his trance, and could
not obey him; when, muttering his usual imprecation, the mate retired
to the quarterdeck.

This was in the first dog-watch, from four to six in the evening. At
about three bells, in the next watch, Max the Dutchman, who, like most
old seamen, was something of a physician in cases of drunkenness,
recommended that Miguel’s clothing should be removed, in order that he
should lie more comfortably. But Jackson, who would seldom let any
thing be done in the forecastle that was not proposed by himself,
capriciously forbade this proceeding.

So the sailor still lay out of sight in his bunk, which was in the
extreme angle of the forecastle, behind the _bowsprit-bitts_—two stout
timbers rooted in the ship’s keel. An hour or two afterward, some of
the men observed a strange odor in the forecastle, which was attributed
to the presence of some dead rat among the hollow spaces in the side
planks; for some days before, the forecastle had been smoked out, to
extirpate the vermin overrunning her. At midnight, the larboard watch,
to which I belonged, turned out; and instantly as every man waked, he
exclaimed at the now intolerable smell, supposed to be heightened by
the shaking up the bilge-water, from the ship’s rolling.

“Blast that rat!” cried the Greenlander.

“He’s blasted already,” said Jackson, who in his drawers had crossed
over to the bunk of Miguel. “It’s a water-rat, shipmates, that’s dead;
and here he is”—and with that, he dragged forth the sailor’s arm,
exclaiming, “Dead as a timber-head!”

Upon this the men rushed toward the bunk, Max with the light, which he
held to the man’s face.

“No, he’s not dead,” he cried, as the yellow flame wavered for a moment
at the seaman’s motionless mouth. But hardly had the words escaped,
when, to the silent horror of all, two threads of greenish fire, like a
forked tongue, darted out between the lips; and in a moment, the
cadaverous face was crawled over by a swarm of wormlike flames.

The lamp dropped from the hand of Max, and went out; while covered all
over with spires and sparkles of flame, that faintly crackled in the
silence, the uncovered parts of the body burned before us, precisely
like phosphorescent shark in a midnight sea.

The eyes were open and fixed; the mouth was curled like a scroll, and
every lean feature firm as in life; while the whole face, now wound in
curls of soft blue flame, wore an aspect of grim defiance, and eternal
death. Prometheus, blasted by fire on the rock.

One arm, its red shirt-sleeve rolled up, exposed the man’s name,
tattooed in vermilion, near the hollow of the middle joint; and as if
there was something peculiar in the painted flesh, every vibrating
letter burned so white, that you might read the flaming name in the
flickering ground of blue.

“Where’s that d—d Miguel?” was now shouted down among us from the
scuttle by the mate, who had just come on deck, and was determined to
have every man up that belonged to his watch.

“He’s gone to the harbor where they never weigh anchor,” coughed
Jackson. “Come you down, sir, and look.”

Thinking that Jackson intended to beard him, the mate sprang down in a
rage; but recoiled at the burning body as if he had been shot by a
bullet. “My God!” he cried, and stood holding fast to the ladder.

“Take hold of it,” said Jackson, at last, to the Greenlander; “it must
go overboard. Don’t stand shaking there, like a dog; take hold of it, I
say! But stop”—and smothering it all in the blankets, he pulled it
partly out of the bunk.

A few minutes more, and it fell with a bubble among the phosphorescent
sparkles of the damp night sea, leaving a coruscating wake as it sank.

This event thrilled me through and through with unspeakable horror; nor
did the conversation of the watch during the next four hours on deck at
all serve to soothe me.

But what most astonished me, and seemed most incredible, was the
infernal opinion of Jackson, that the man had been actually dead when
brought on board the ship; and that knowingly, and merely for the sake
of the month’s advance, paid into his hand upon the strength of the
bill he presented, the body-snatching crimp had knowingly shipped a
corpse on board of the Highlander, under the pretense of its being a
live body in a drunken trance. And I heard Jackson say, that he had
known of such things having been done before. But that a really dead
body ever burned in that manner, I can not even yet believe. But the
sailors seemed familiar with such things; or at least with the stories
of such things having happened to others.

For me, who at that age had never so much as happened to hear of a case
like this, of animal combustion, in the horrid mood that came over me,
I almost thought the burning body was a premonition of the hell of the
Calvinists, and that Miguel’s earthly end was a foretaste of his
eternal condemnation.

Immediately after the burial, an iron pot of red coals was placed in
the bunk, and in it two handfuls of coffee were roasted. This done, the
bunk was nailed up, and was never opened again during the voyage; and
strict orders were given to the crew not to divulge what had taken
place to the emigrants; but to this, they needed no commands.

After the event, no one sailor but Jackson would stay alone in the
forecastle, by night or by noon; and no more would they laugh or sing,
or in any way make merry there, but kept all their pleasantries for the
watches on deck. All but Jackson: who, while the rest would be sitting
silently smoking on their chests, or in their bunks, would look toward
the fatal spot, and cough, and laugh, and invoke the dead man with
incredible scoffs and jeers. He froze my blood, and made my soul stand
still.




CHAPTER XLIX.
CARLO


There was on board our ship, among the emigrant passengers, a
rich-cheeked, chestnut-haired Italian boy, arrayed in a faded,
olive-hued velvet jacket, and tattered trowsers rolled up to his knee.
He was not above fifteen years of age; but in the twilight pensiveness
of his full morning eyes, there seemed to sleep experiences so sad and
various, that his days must have seemed to him years. It was not an eye
like Harry’s tho’ Harry’s was large and womanly. It shone with a soft
and spiritual radiance, like a moist star in a tropic sky; and spoke of
humility, deep-seated thoughtfulness, yet a careless endurance of all
the ills of life.

The head was if any thing small; and heaped with thick clusters of
tendril curls, half overhanging the brows and delicate ears, it somehow
reminded you of a classic vase, piled up with Falernian foliage.

From the knee downward, the naked leg was beautiful to behold as any
lady’s arm; so soft and rounded, with infantile ease and grace. His
whole figure was free, fine, and indolent; he was such a boy as might
have ripened into life in a Neapolitan vineyard; such a boy as gipsies
steal in infancy; such a boy as Murillo often painted, when he went
among the poor and outcast, for subjects wherewith to captivate the
eyes of rank and wealth; such a boy, as only Andalusian beggars are,
full of poetry, gushing from every rent.

Carlo was his name; a poor and friendless son of earth, who had no
sire; and on life’s ocean was swept along, as spoon-drift in a gale.

Some months previous, he had landed in Prince’s Dock, with his
hand-organ, from a Messina vessel; and had walked the streets of
Liverpool, playing the sunny airs of southern climes, among the
northern fog and drizzle. And now, having laid by enough to pay his
passage over the Atlantic, he had again embarked, to seek his fortunes
in America.

From the first, Harry took to the boy.

“Carlo,” said Harry, “how did you succeed in England?”

He was reclining upon an old sail spread on the long-boat; and throwing
back his soiled but tasseled cap, and caressing one leg like a child,
he looked up, and said in his broken English—that seemed like mixing
the potent wine of Oporto with some delicious syrup:—said he, “Ah! I
succeed very well!—for I have tunes for the young and the old, the gay
and the sad. I have marches for military young men, and love-airs for
the ladies, and solemn sounds for the aged. I never draw a crowd, but I
know from their faces what airs will best please them; I never stop
before a house, but I judge from its portico for what tune they will
soonest toss me some silver. And I ever play sad airs to the merry, and
merry airs to the sad; and most always the rich best fancy the sad, and
the poor the merry.”

“But do you not sometimes meet with cross and crabbed old men,” said
Harry, “who would much rather have your room than your music?”

“Yes, sometimes,” said Carlo, playing with his foot, “sometimes I do.”

“And then, knowing the value of quiet to unquiet men, I suppose you
never leave them under a shilling?”

“No,” continued the boy, “I love my organ as I do myself, for it is my
only friend, poor organ! it sings to me when I am sad, and cheers me;
and I never play before a house, on purpose to be paid for leaving off,
not I; would I, poor organ?”— looking down the hatchway where it was.
“No, that I never have done, and never will do, though I starve; for
when people drive me away, I do not think my organ is to blame, but
they themselves are to blame; for such people’s musical pipes are
cracked, and grown rusted, that no more music can be breathed into
their souls.”

“No, Carlo; no music like yours, perhaps,” said Harry, with a laugh.

“Ah! there’s the mistake. Though my organ is as full of melody, as a
hive is of bees; yet no organ can make music in unmusical breasts; no
more than my native winds can, when they breathe upon a harp without
chords.”

Next day was a serene and delightful one; and in the evening when the
vessel was just rippling along impelled by a gentle yet steady breeze,
and the poor emigrants, relieved from their late sufferings, were
gathered on deck; Carlo suddenly started up from his lazy reclinings;
went below, and, assisted by the emigrants, returned with his organ.

Now, music is a holy thing, and its instruments, however humble, are to
be loved and revered. Whatever has made, or does make, or may make
music, should be held sacred as the golden bridle-bit of the Shah of
Persia’s horse, and the golden hammer, with which his hoofs are shod.
Musical instruments should be like the silver tongs, with which the
high-priests tended the Jewish altars—never to be touched by a hand
profane. Who would bruise the poorest reed of Pan, though plucked from
a beggar’s hedge, would insult the melodious god himself.

And there is no humble thing with music in it, not a fife, not a
negro-fiddle, that is not to be reverenced as much as the grandest
architectural organ that ever rolled its flood-tide of harmony down a
cathedral nave. For even a Jew’s-harp may be so played, as to awaken
all the fairies that are in us, and make them dance in our souls, as on
a moon-lit sward of violets.

But what subtle power is this, residing in but a bit of steel, which
might have made a tenpenny nail, that so enters, without knocking, into
our inmost beings, and shows us all hidden things?

Not in a spirit of foolish speculation altogether, in no merely
transcendental mood, did the glorious Greek of old fancy the human soul
to be essentially a harmony. And if we grant that theory of Paracelsus
and Campanella, that every man has four souls within him; then can we
account for those banded sounds with silver links, those quartettes of
melody, that sometimes sit and sing within us, as if our souls were
baronial halls, and our music were made by the hoarest old harpers of
Wales.

But look! here is poor Carlo’s organ; and while the silent crowd
surrounds him, there he stands, looking mildly but inquiringly about
him; his right hand pulling and twitching the ivory knobs at one end of
his instrument.

Behold the organ!

Surely, if much virtue lurk in the old fiddles of Cremona, and if their
melody be in proportion to their antiquity, what divine ravishments may
we not anticipate from this venerable, embrowned old organ, which might
almost have played the Dead March in Saul, when King Saul himself was
buried.

A fine old organ! carved into fantastic old towers, and turrets, and
belfries; its architecture seems somewhat of the Gothic, monastic
order; in front, it looks like the West-Front of York Minster.

What sculptured arches, leading into mysterious intricacies!—what
mullioned windows, that seem as if they must look into chapels flooded
with devotional sunsets!—what flying buttresses, and gable-ends, and
niches with saints!—But stop! ’tis a Moorish iniquity; for here, as I
live, is a Saracenic arch; which, for aught I know, may lead into some
interior Alhambra.

Ay, it does; for as Carlo now turns his hand, I hear the gush of the
Fountain of Lions, as he plays some thronged Italian air—a mixed and
liquid sea of sound, that dashes its spray in my face.

Play on, play on, Italian boy! what though the notes be broken, here’s
that within that mends them. Turn hither your pensive, morning eyes;
and while I list to the organs twain— one yours, one mine—let me gaze
fathoms down into thy fathomless eye;—’tis good as gazing down into the
great South Sea, and seeing the dazzling rays of the dolphins there.

Play on, play on! for to every note come trooping, now, triumphant
standards, armies marching—all the pomp of sound. Methinks I am Xerxes,
the nucleus of the martial neigh of all the Persian studs. Like gilded
damask-flies, thick clustering on some lofty bough, my satraps swarm
around me.

But now the pageant passes, and I droop; while Carlo taps his ivory
knobs; and plays some flute-like saraband—soft, dulcet, dropping
sounds, like silver cans in bubbling brooks. And now a clanging,
martial air, as if ten thousand brazen trumpets, forged from spurs and
swordhilts, called North, and South, and East, to rush to West!

Again—what blasted heath is this?—what goblin sounds of Macbeth’s
witches?—Beethoven’s Spirit Waltz! the muster-call of sprites and
specters. Now come, hands joined, Medusa, Hecate, she of Endor, and all
the Blocksberg’s, demons dire.

Once more the ivory knobs are tapped; and long-drawn, golden sounds are
heard—some ode to Cleopatra; slowly loom, and solemnly expand, vast,
rounding orbs of beauty; and before me float innumerable queens, deep
dipped in silver gauzes.

All this could Carlo do—make, unmake me; build me up; to pieces take
me; and join me limb to limb. He is the architect of domes of sound,
and bowers of song.

And all is done with that old organ! Reverenced, then, be all street
organs; more melody is at the beck of my Italian boy, than lurks in
squadrons of Parisian orchestras.

But look! Carlo has that to feast the eye as well as ear; and the same
wondrous magic in me, magnifies them into grandeur; though every figure
greatly needs the artist’s repairing hand, and sadly needs a dusting.

His York Minster’s West-Front opens; and like the gates of Milton’s
heaven, it turns on golden hinges.

What have we here? The inner palace of the Great Mogul? Group and
gilded columns, in confidential clusters; fixed fountains; canopies and
lounges; and lords and dames in silk and spangles.

The organ plays a stately march; and presto! wide open arches; and out
come, two and two, with nodding plumes, in crimson turbans, a troop of
martial men; with jingling scimiters, they pace the hall; salute, pass
on, and disappear.

Now, ground and lofty tumblers; jet black Nubian slaves. They fling
themselves on poles; stand on their heads; and downward vanish.

And now a dance and masquerade of figures, reeling from the side-doors,
among the knights and dames. Some sultan leads a sultaness; some
emperor, a queen; and jeweled sword-hilts of carpet knights fling back
the glances tossed by coquettes of countesses.

On this, the curtain drops; and there the poor old organ stands,
begrimed, and black, and rickety.

Now, tell me, Carlo, if at street corners, for a single penny, I may
thus transport myself in dreams Elysian, who so rich as I? Not he who
owns a million.

And Carlo! ill betide the voice that ever greets thee, my Italian boy,
with aught but kindness; cursed the slave who ever drives thy wondrous
box of sights and sounds forth from a lordling’s door!




CHAPTER L.
HARRY BOLTON AT SEA


As yet I have said nothing about how my friend, Harry, got along as a
sailor.

Poor Harry! a feeling of sadness, never to be comforted, comes over me,
even now when I think of you. For this voyage that you went, but
carried you part of the way to that ocean grave, which has buried you
up with your secrets, and whither no mourning pilgrimage can be made.

But why this gloom at the thought of the dead? And why should we not be
glad? Is it, that we ever think of them as departed from all joy? Is
it, that we believe that indeed they are dead? They revisit us not, the
departed; their voices no more ring in the air; summer may come, but it
is winter with them; and even in our own limbs we feel not the sap that
every spring renews the green life of the trees.

But Harry! you live over again, as I recall your image before me. I see
you, plain and palpable as in life; and can make your existence obvious
to others. Is he, then, dead, of whom this may be said?

But Harry! you are mixed with a thousand strange forms, the centaurs of
fancy; half real and human, half wild and grotesque. Divine imaginings,
like gods, come down to the groves of our Thessalies, and there, in the
embrace of wild, dryad reminiscences, beget the beings that astonish
the world.

But Harry! though your image now roams in my Thessaly groves, it is the
same as of old; and among the droves of mixed beings and centaurs, you
show like a zebra, banding with elks.

And indeed, in his striped Guernsey frock, dark glossy skin and hair,
Harry Bolton, mingling with the Highlander’s crew, looked not unlike
the soft, silken quadruped-creole, that, pursued by wild Bushmen,
bounds through Caffrarian woods.

How they hunted you, Harry, my zebra! those ocean barbarians, those
unimpressible, uncivilized sailors of ours! How they pursued you from
bowsprit to mainmast, and started you out of your every retreat!

Before the day of our sailing, it was known to the seamen that the
girlish youth, whom they daily saw near the sign of the Clipper in
Union-street, would form one of their homeward-bound crew. Accordingly,
they cast upon him many a critical glance; but were not long in
concluding that Harry would prove no very great accession to their
strength; that the hoist of so tender an arm would not tell many
hundred-weight on the maintop-sail halyards. Therefore they disliked
him before they became acquainted with him; and such dislikes, as every
one knows, are the most inveterate, and liable to increase. But even
sailors are not blind to the sacredness that hallows a stranger; and
for a time, abstaining from rudeness, they only maintained toward my
friend a cold and unsympathizing civility.

As for Harry, at first the novelty of the scene filled up his mind; and
the thought of being bound for a distant land, carried with it, as with
every one, a buoyant feeling of undefinable expectation. And though his
money was now gone again, all but a sovereign or two, yet that troubled
him but little, in the first flush of being at sea.

But I was surprised, that one who had certainly seen much of life,
should evince such an incredible ignorance of what was wholly
inadmissible in a person situated as he was. But perhaps his
familiarity with lofty life, only the less qualified him for
understanding the other extreme. Will you believe me, this Bury blade
once came on deck in a brocaded dressing-gown, embroidered slippers,
and tasseled smoking-cap, to stand his morning watch.

As soon as I beheld him thus arrayed, a suspicion, which had previously
crossed my mind, again recurred, and I almost vowed to myself that,
spite his protestations, Harry Bolton never could have been at sea
before, even as a _Guinea-pig_ in an Indiaman; for the slightest
acquaintance with the sea-life and sailors, should have prevented him,
it would seem, from enacting this folly.

“Who’s that Chinese mandarin?” cried the mate, who had made voyages to
Canton. “Look you, my fine fellow, douse that mainsail now, and furl it
in a trice.”

“Sir?” said Harry, starting back. “Is not this the morning watch, and
is not mine a morning gown?”

But though, in my refined friend’s estimation, nothing could be more
appropriate; in the mate’s, it was the most monstrous of incongruities;
and the offensive gown and cap were removed.

“It is too bad!” exclaimed Harry to me; “I meant to lounge away the
watch in that gown until coffee time;—and I suppose your Hottentot of a
mate won’t permit a gentleman to smoke his Turkish pipe of a morning;
but by gad, I’ll wear straps to my pantaloons to spite him!”

Oh! that was the rock on which you split, poor Harry! Incensed at the
want of polite refinement in the mates and crew, Harry, in a pet and
pique, only determined to provoke them the more; and the storm of
indignation he raised very soon overwhelmed him.

The sailors took a special spite to his chest, a large mahogany one,
which he had had made to order at a furniture warehouse. It was
ornamented with brass screw-heads, and other devices; and was well
filled with those articles of the wardrobe in which Harry had sported
through a London season; for the various vests and pantaloons he had
sold in Liverpool, when in want of money, had not materially lessened
his extensive stock.

It was curious to listen to the various hints and opinings thrown out
by the sailors at the occasional glimpses they had of this collection
of silks, velvets, broadcloths, and satins. I do not know exactly what
they thought Harry had been; but they seemed unanimous in believing
that, by abandoning his country, Harry had left more room for the
gamblers. Jackson even asked him to lift up the lower hem of his
browsers, to test the color of his calves.

It is a noteworthy circumstance, that whenever a slender made youth, of
easy manners and polite address happens to form one of a ship’s
company, the sailors almost invariably impute his sea-going to an
irresistible necessity of decamping from terra-firma in order to evade
the constables.

These white-fingered gentry must be light-fingered too, they say to
themselves, or they would not be after putting their hands into our
tar. What else can bring them to sea?

Cogent and conclusive this; and thus Harry, from the very beginning,
was put down for a very equivocal character.

Sometimes, however, they only made sport of his appearance; especially
one evening, when his monkey jacket being wet through, he was obliged
to mount one of his swallow-tailed coats. They said he carried two
mizzen-peaks at his stern; declared he was a broken-down quill-driver,
or a footman to a Portuguese running barber, or some old maid’s
tobacco-boy. As for the captain, it had become all the same to Harry as
if there were no gentlemanly and complaisant Captain Riga on board. For
to his no small astonishment,—but just as I had predicted,—Captain Riga
never noticed him now, but left the business of indoctrinating him into
the little experiences of a greenhorn’s career solely in the hands of
his officers and crew.

But the worst was to come. For the first few days, whenever there was
any running aloft to be done, I noticed that Harry was indefatigable in
coiling away the slack of the rigging about decks; ignoring the fact
that his shipmates were springing into the shrouds. And when all hands
of the watch would be engaged _clewing up a t’-gallant-sail,_ that is,
pulling the proper ropes on deck that wrapped the sail up on the yard
aloft, Harry would always manage to get near the _belaying-pin, so_
that when the time came for two of us to spring into the rigging, he
would be inordinately fidgety in making fast the _clew-lines,_ and
would be so absorbed in that occupation, and would so elaborate the
hitchings round the pin, that it was quite impossible for him, after
doing so much, to mount over the bulwarks before his comrades had got
there. However, after securing the clew-lines beyond a possibility of
their getting loose, Harry would always make a feint of starting in a
prodigious hurry for the shrouds; but suddenly looking up, and seeing
others in advance, would retreat, apparently quite chagrined that he
had been cut off from the opportunity of signalizing his activity.

At this I was surprised, and spoke to my friend; when the alarming fact
was confessed, that he had made a private trial of it, and it never
would do: _he could not go aloft;_ his nerves would not hear of it.

“Then, Harry,” said I, “better you had never been born. Do you know
what it is that you are coming to? Did you not tell me that you made no
doubt you would acquit yourself well in the rigging? Did you not say
that you had been two voyages to Bombay? Harry, you were mad to ship.
But you only imagine it: try again; and my word for it, you will very
soon find yourself as much at home among the spars as a bird in a
tree.”

But he could not be induced to try it over again; the fact was, _his
nerves could not stand it;_ in the course of his courtly career, he had
drunk too much strong Mocha coffee and gunpowder tea, and had smoked
altogether too many Havannas.

At last, as I had repeatedly warned him, the mate singled him out one
morning, and commanded him to mount to the main-truck, and unreeve the
short signal halyards.

“Sir?” said Harry, aghast.

“Away you go!” said the mate, snatching a whip’s end.

“Don’t strike me!” screamed Harry, drawing himself up.

“Take that, and along with you,” cried the mate, laying the rope once
across his back, but lightly.

“By heaven!” cried Harry, wincing—not with the blow, but the insult:
and then making a dash at the mate, who, holding out his long arm, kept
him lazily at bay, and laughed at him, till, had I not feared a broken
head, I should infallibly have pitched my boy’s bulk into the officer.

“Captain Riga!” cried Harry.

“Don’t call upon _him”_ said the mate; “he’s asleep, and won’t wake up
till we strike Yankee soundings again. Up you go!” he added,
flourishing the rope’s end.

Harry looked round among the grinning tars with a glance of terrible
indignation and agony; and then settling his eye on me, and seeing
there no hope, but even an admonition of obedience, as his only
resource, he made one bound into the rigging, and was up at the
main-top in a trice. I thought a few more springs would take him to the
truck, and was a little fearful that in his desperation he might then
jump overboard; for I had heard of delirious greenhorns doing such
things at sea, and being lost forever. But no; he stopped short, and
looked down from the top. Fatal glance! it unstrung his every fiber;
and I saw him reel, and clutch the shrouds, till the mate shouted out
for him not to squeeze the tar out of the ropes. “Up you go, sir.” But
Harry said nothing.

“You Max,” cried the mate to the Dutch sailor, “spring after him, and
help him; you understand?”

Max went up the rigging hand over hand, and brought his red head with a
bump against the base of Harry’s back. Needs must when the devil
drives; and higher and higher, with Max bumping him at every step, went
my unfortunate friend. At last he gained the royal yard, and the thin
signal halyards—, hardly bigger than common twine—were flying in the
wind. “Unreeve!” cried the mate.

I saw Harry’s arm stretched out—his legs seemed shaking in the rigging,
even to us, down on deck; and at last, thank heaven! the deed was done.

He came down pale as death, with bloodshot eyes, and every limb
quivering. From that moment he never put foot in rattlin; never mounted
above the bulwarks; and for the residue of the voyage, at least, became
an altered person.

At the time, he went to the mate—since he could not get speech of the
captain—and conjured him to intercede with Riga, that his name might be
stricken off from the list of the ship’s company, so that he might make
the voyage as a steerage passenger; for which privilege, he bound
himself to pay, as soon as he could dispose of some things of his in
New York, over and above the ordinary passage-money. But the mate gave
him a blunt denial; and a look of wonder at his effrontery. Once a
sailor on board a ship, and _always_ a sailor for that voyage, at
least; for within so brief a period, no officer can bear to associate
on terms of any thing like equality with a person whom he has ordered
about at his pleasure.

Harry then told the mate solemnly, that he might do what he pleased,
but go aloft again he _could_ not, and _would_ not. He would do any
thing else but that.

This affair sealed Harry’s fate on board of the Highlander; the crew
now reckoned him fair play for their worst jibes and jeers, and he led
a miserable life indeed.

Few landsmen can imagine the depressing and self-humiliating effects of
finding one’s self, for the first time, at the beck of illiterate
sea-tyrants, with no opportunity of exhibiting any trait about you, but
your ignorance of every thing connected with the sea-life that you
lead, and the duties you are constantly called upon to perform. In such
a sphere, and under such circumstances, Isaac Newton and Lord Bacon
would be sea-clowns and bumpkins; and Napoleon Bonaparte be cuffed and
kicked without remorse. In more than one instance I have seen the truth
of this; and Harry, poor Harry, proved no exception. And from the
circumstances which exempted me from experiencing the bitterest of
these evils, I only the more felt for one who, from a strange
constitutional nervousness, before unknown even to himself, was become
as a hunted hare to the merciless crew.

But how was it that Harry Bolton, who spite of his effeminacy of
appearance, had evinced, in our London trip, such unmistakable flashes
of a spirit not easily tamed—how was it, that he could now yield
himself up to the almost passive reception of contumely and contempt?
Perhaps his spirit, for the time, had been broken. But I will not
undertake to explain; we are curious creatures, as every one knows; and
there are passages in the lives of all men, so out of keeping with the
common tenor of their ways, and so seemingly contradictory of
themselves, that only He who made us can expound them.




CHAPTER LI.
THE EMIGRANTS


After the first miserable weather we experienced at sea, we had
intervals of foul and fair, mostly the former, however, attended with
head winds, till at last, after a three days’ fog and rain, the sun
rose cheerily one morning, and showed us Cape Clear. Thank heaven, we
were out of the weather emphatically called _“Channel weather,”_ and
the last we should see of the eastern hemisphere was now in plain
sight, and all the rest was broad ocean.

_Land ho!_ was cried, as the dark purple headland grew out of the
north. At the cry, the Irish emigrants came rushing up the hatchway,
thinking America itself was at hand.

“Where is it?” cried one of them, running out a little way on the
bowsprit. “Is _that_ it?”

“Aye, it doesn’t look much like _ould_ Ireland, does it?” said Jackson.

“Not a bit, honey:—and how long before we get there? to-night?”

Nothing could exceed the disappointment and grief of the emigrants,
when they were at last informed, that the land to the north was their
own native island, which, after leaving three or four weeks previous in
a steamboat for Liverpool, was now close to them again; and that, after
newly voyaging so many days from the Mersey, the Highlander was only
bringing them in view of the original home whence they started.

They were the most simple people I had ever seen. They seemed to have
no adequate idea of distances; and to them, America must have seemed as
a place just over a river. Every morning some of them came on deck, to
see how much nearer we were: and one old man would stand for hours
together, looking straight off from the bows, as if he expected to see
New York city every minute, when, perhaps, we were yet two thousand
miles distant, and steering, moreover, against a head wind.

The only thing that ever diverted this poor old man from his earnest
search for land, was the occasional appearance of porpoises under the
bows; when he would cry out at the top of his voice—“Look, look, ye
divils! look at the great pigs of the sea!”

At last, the emigrants began to think, that the ship had played them
false; and that she was bound for the East Indies, or some other remote
place; and one night, Jackson set a report going among them, that Riga
purposed taking them to Barbary, and selling them all for slaves; but
though some of the old women almost believed it, and a great weeping
ensued among the children, yet the men knew better than to believe such
a ridiculous tale.

Of all the emigrants, my Italian boy Carlo, seemed most at his ease. He
would lie all day in a dreamy mood, sunning himself in the long boat,
and gazing out on the sea. At night, he would bring up his organ, and
play for several hours; much to the delight of his fellow voyagers, who
blessed him and his organ again and again; and paid him for his music
by furnishing him his meals. Sometimes, the steward would come forward,
when it happened to be very much of a moonlight, with a message from
the cabin, for Carlo to repair to the quarterdeck, and entertain the
gentlemen and ladies.

There was a fiddler on board, as will presently be seen; and sometimes,
by urgent entreaties, he was induced to unite his music with Carlo’s,
for the benefit of the cabin occupants; but this was only twice or
thrice: for this fiddler deemed himself considerably elevated above the
other steerage-passengers; and did not much fancy the idea of fiddling
to strangers; and thus wear out his elbow, while persons, entirely
unknown to him, and in whose welfare he felt not the slightest
interest, were curveting about in famous high spirits. So for the most
part, the gentlemen and ladies were fain to dance as well as they could
to my little Italian’s organ.

It was the most accommodating organ in the world; for it could play any
tune that was called for; Carlo pulling in and out the ivory knobs at
one side, and so manufacturing melody at pleasure.

True, some censorious gentlemen cabin-passengers protested, that such
or such an air, was not precisely according to Handel or Mozart; and
some ladies, whom I overheard talking about throwing their nosegays to
Malibran at Covent Garden, assured the attentive Captain Riga, that
Carlo’s organ was a most wretched affair, and made a horrible din.

“Yes, ladies,” said the captain, bowing, “by your leave, I think
Carlo’s organ must have lost its mother, for it squeals like a pig
running after its dam.”

Harry was incensed at these criticisms; and yet these cabin-people were
all ready enough to dance to poor Carlo’s music.

“Carlo”—said I, one night, as he was marching forward from the
quarter-deck, after one of these sea-quadrilles, which took place
during my watch on deck:—“Carlo”—said I, “what do the gentlemen and
ladies give you for playing?”

“Look!”—and he showed me three copper medals of Britannia and her
shield—three English pennies.

Now, whenever we discover a dislike in us, toward any one, we should
ever be a little suspicious of ourselves. It may be, therefore, that
the natural antipathy with which almost all seamen and
steerage-passengers, regard the inmates of the cabin, was one cause at
least, of my not feeling very charitably disposed toward them, myself.

Yes: that might have been; but nevertheless, I will let nature have her
own way for once; and here declare roundly, that, however it was, I
cherished a feeling toward these cabin-passengers, akin to contempt.
Not because they happened to be cabin-passengers: not at all: but only
because they seemed the most finical, miserly, mean men and women, that
ever stepped over the Atlantic.

One of them was an old fellow in a robust looking coat, with broad
skirts; he had a nose like a bottle of port-wine; and would stand for a
whole hour, with his legs straddling apart, and his hands deep down in
his breeches pockets, as if he had two mints at work there, coining
guineas. He was an abominable looking old fellow, with cold, fat,
jelly-like eyes; and avarice, heartlessness, and sensuality stamped all
over him. He seemed all the time going through some process of mental
arithmetic; doing sums with dollars and cents: his very mouth, wrinkled
and drawn up at the corners, looked like a purse. When he dies, his
skull ought to be turned into a savings box, with the till-hole between
his teeth.

Another of the cabin inmates, was a middle-aged Londoner, in a comical
Cockney-cut coat, with a pair of semicircular tails: so that he looked
as if he were sitting in a swing. He wore a spotted neckerchief; a
short, little, fiery-red vest; and striped pants, very thin in the
calf, but very full about the waist. There was nothing describable
about him but his dress; for he had such a meaningless face, I can not
remember it; though I have a vague impression, that it looked at the
time, as if its owner was laboring under the mumps.

Then there were two or three buckish looking young fellows, among the
rest; who were all the time playing at cards on the poop, under the lee
of the _spanker;_ or smoking cigars on the taffrail; or sat quizzing
the emigrant women with opera-glasses, leveled through the windows of
the upper cabin. These sparks frequently called for the steward to help
them to brandy and water, and talked about going on to Washington, to
see Niagara Falls.

There was also an old gentleman, who had brought with him three or four
heavy files of the _London Times,_ and other papers; and he spent all
his hours in reading them, on the shady side of the deck, with one leg
crossed over the other; and without crossed legs, he never read at all.
That was indispensable to the proper understanding of what he studied.
He growled terribly, when disturbed by the sailors, who now and then
were obliged to move him to get at the ropes.

As for the ladies, I have nothing to say concerning them; for ladies
are like creeds; if you can not speak well of them, say nothing.




CHAPTER LII.
THE EMIGRANTS’ KITCHEN


I have made some mention of the “galley,” or great stove for the
steerage passengers, which was planted over the main hatches.

During the outward-bound passage, there were so few occupants of the
steerage, that they had abundant room to do their cooking at this
galley. But it was otherwise now; for we had four or five hundred in
the steerage; and all their cooking was to be done by one fire; a
pretty large one, to be sure, but, nevertheless, small enough,
considering the number to be accommodated, and the fact that the fire
was only to be kindled at certain hours.

For the emigrants in these ships are under a sort of martial-law; and
in all their affairs are regulated by the despotic ordinances of the
captain. And though it is evident, that to a certain extent this is
necessary, and even indispensable; yet, as at sea no appeal lies beyond
the captain, he too often makes unscrupulous use of his power. And as
for going to law with him at the end of the voyage, you might as well
go to law with the Czar of Russia.

At making the fire, the emigrants take turns; as it is often very
disagreeable work, owing to the pitching of the ship, and the heaving
of the spray over the uncovered “galley.” Whenever I had the morning
watch, from four to eight, I was sure to see some poor fellow crawling
up from below about daybreak, and go to groping over the deck after
bits of rope-yarn, or tarred canvas, for kindling-stuff. And no sooner
would the fire be fairly made, than up came the old women, and men, and
children; each armed with an iron pot or saucepan; and invariably a
great tumult ensued, as to whose turn to cook came next; sometimes the
more quarrelsome would fight, and upset each other’s pots and pans.

Once, an English lad came up with a little coffee-pot, which he managed
to crowd in between two pans. This done, he went below. Soon after a
great strapping Irishman, in knee-breeches and bare calves, made his
appearance; and eying the row of things on the fire, asked whose
coffee-pot that was; upon being told, he removed it, and put his own in
its place; saying something about that individual place belonging to
him; and with that, he turned aside.

Not long after, the boy came along again; and seeing his pot removed,
made a violent exclamation, and replaced it; which the Irishman no
sooner perceived, than he rushed at him, with his fists doubled. The
boy snatched up the boiling coffee, and spirted its contents all about
the fellow’s bare legs; which incontinently began to dance involuntary
hornpipes and fandangoes, as a preliminary to giving chase to the boy,
who by this time, however, had decamped.

Many similar scenes occurred every day; nor did a single day pass, but
scores of the poor people got no chance whatever to do their cooking.

This was bad enough; but it was a still more miserable thing, to see
these poor emigrants wrangling and fighting together for the want of
the most ordinary accommodations. But thus it is, that the very
hardships to which such beings are subjected, instead of uniting them,
only tends, by imbittering their tempers, to set them against each
other; and thus they themselves drive the strongest rivet into the
chain, by which their social superiors hold them subject.

It was with a most reluctant hand, that every evening in the second
dog-watch, at the mate’s command, I would march up to the fire, and
giving notice to the assembled crowd, that the time was come to
extinguish it, would dash it out with my bucket of salt water; though
many, who had long waited for a chance to cook, had now to go away
disappointed.

The staple food of the Irish emigrants was oatmeal and water, boiled
into what is sometimes called _mush;_ by the Dutch is known as
_supaan;_ by sailors _burgoo;_ by the New Englanders _hasty-pudding;_
in which hasty-pudding, by the way, the poet Barlow found the materials
for a sort of epic.

Some of the steerage passengers, however, were provided with
sea-biscuit, and other perennial food, that was eatable all the year
round, fire or no fire.

There were several, moreover, who seemed better to do in the world than
the rest; who were well furnished with hams, cheese, Bologna sausages,
Dutch herrings, alewives, and other delicacies adapted to the
contingencies of a voyager in the steerage.

There was a little old Englishman on board, who had been a grocer
ashore, whose greasy trunks seemed all pantries; and he was constantly
using himself for a cupboard, by transferring their contents into his
own interior. He was a little light of head, I always thought. He
particularly doated on his long strings of sausages; and would
sometimes take them out, and play with them, wreathing them round him,
like an Indian juggler with charmed snakes. What with this diversion,
and eating his cheese, and helping himself from an inexhaustible junk
bottle, and smoking his pipe, and meditating, this crack-pated grocer
made time jog along with him at a tolerably easy pace.

But by far the most considerable man in the steerage, in point of
pecuniary circumstances at least, was a slender little pale-faced
English tailor, who it seemed had engaged a passage for himself and
wife in some imaginary section of the ship, called the _second cabin,_
which was feigned to combine the comforts of the first cabin with the
cheapness of the steerage. But it turned out that this second cabin was
comprised in the after part of the steerage itself, with nothing
intervening but a name. So to his no small disgust, he found himself
herding with the rabble; and his complaints to the captain were
unheeded.

This luckless tailor was tormented the whole voyage by his wife, who
was young and handsome; just such a beauty as farmers’-boys fall in
love with; she had bright eyes, and red cheeks, and looked plump and
happy.

She was a sad coquette; and did not turn away, as she was bound to do,
from the dandy glances of the cabin bucks, who ogled her through their
double-barreled opera glasses. This enraged the tailor past telling; he
would remonstrate with his wife, and scold her; and lay his matrimonial
commands upon her, to go below instantly, out of sight. But the lady
was not to be tyrannized over; and so she told him. Meantime, the bucks
would be still framing her in their lenses, mightily enjoying the fun.
The last resources of the poor tailor would be, to start up, and make a
dash at the rogues, with clenched fists; but upon getting as far as the
mainmast, the mate would accost him from over the rope that divided
them, and beg leave to communicate the fact, that he could come no
further. This unfortunate tailor was also a fiddler; and when fairly
baited into desperation, would rush for his instrument, and try to get
rid of his wrath by playing the most savage, remorseless airs he could
think of.

While thus employed, perhaps his wife would accost him—

“Billy, my dear;” and lay her soft hand on his shoulder.

But Billy, he only fiddled harder.

“Billy, my love!”

The bow went faster and faster.

“Come, now, Billy, my dear little fellow, let’s make it all up;” and
she bent over his knees, looking bewitchingly up at him, with her
irresistible eyes.

Down went fiddle and bow; and the couple would sit together for an hour
or two, as pleasant and affectionate as possible.

But the next day, the chances were, that the old feud would be renewed,
which was certain to be the case at the first glimpse of an opera-glass
from the cabin.




CHAPTER LIII.
THE HORATII AND CURIATII


With a slight alteration, I might begin this chapter after the manner
of Livy, in the 24th section of his first book:—“It _happened, that in
each family were three twin brothers, between whom there was little
disparity in point of age or of strength.”_

Among the steerage passengers of the Highlander, were two women from
Armagh, in Ireland, widows and sisters, who had each three twin sons,
born, as they said, on the same day.

They were ten years old. Each three of these six cousins were as like
as the mutually reflected figures in a kaleidoscope; and like the forms
seen in a kaleidoscope, together, as well as separately, they seemed to
form a complete figure. But, though besides this fraternal likeness,
all six boys bore a strong cousin-german resemblance to each other;
yet, the O’Briens were in disposition quite the reverse of the
O’Regans. The former were a timid, silent trio, who used to revolve
around their mother’s waist, and seldom quit the maternal orbit;
whereas, the O’Regans were “broths of boys,” full of mischief and fun,
and given to all manner of devilment, like the tails of the comets.

Early every morning, Mrs. O’Regan emerged from the steerage, driving
her spirited twins before her, like a riotous herd of young steers; and
made her way to the capacious deck-tub, full of salt water, pumped up
from the sea, for the purpose of washing down the ship. Three splashes,
and the three boys were ducking and diving together in the brine; their
mother engaged in _shampooing_ them, though it was haphazard sort of
work enough; a rub here, and a scrub there, as she could manage to
fasten on a stray limb.

“Pat, ye divil, hould still while I wash ye. Ah! but it’s you, Teddy,
you rogue. Arrah, now, Mike, ye spalpeen, don’t be mixing your legs up
with Pat’s.”

The little rascals, leaping and scrambling with delight, enjoyed the
sport mightily; while this indefatigable, but merry matron, manipulated
them all over, as if it were a matter of conscience.

Meanwhile, Mrs. O’Brien would be standing on the boatswain’s locker—or
rope and tar-pot pantry in the vessel’s bows—with a large old quarto
Bible, black with age, laid before her between the knight-heads, and
reading aloud to her three meek little lambs.

The sailors took much pleasure in the deck-tub performances of the
O’Regans, and greatly admired them always for their archness and
activity; but the tranquil O’Briens they did not fancy so much. More
especially they disliked the grave matron herself; hooded in rusty
black; and they had a bitter grudge against her book. To that, and the
incantations muttered over it, they ascribed the head winds that
haunted us; and Blunt, our Irish cockney, really believed that Mrs.
O’Brien purposely came on deck every morning, in order to secure a foul
wind for the next ensuing twenty-four hours.

At last, upon her coming forward one morning, Max the Dutchman accosted
her, saying he was sorry for it, but if she went between the
knight-heads again with her book, the crew would throw it overboard for
her.

Now, although contrasted in character, there existed a great warmth of
affection between the two families of twins, which upon this occasion
was curiously manifested.

Notwithstanding the rebuke and threat of the sailor, the widow silently
occupied her old place; and with her children clustering round her,
began her low, muttered reading, standing right in the extreme bows of
the ship, and slightly leaning over them, as if addressing the
multitudinous waves from a floating pulpit. Presently Max came behind
her, snatched the book from her hands, and threw it overboard. The
widow gave a wail, and her boys set up a cry. Their cousins, then
ducking in the water close by, at once saw the cause of the cry; and
springing from the tub, like so many dogs, seized Max by the legs,
biting and striking at him: which, the before timid little O’Briens no
sooner perceived, than they, too, threw themselves on the enemy, and
the amazed seaman found himself baited like a bull by all six boys.

And here it gives me joy to record one good thing on the part of the
mate. He saw the fray, and its beginning; and rushing forward, told Max
that he would harm the boys at his peril; while he cheered them on, as
if rejoiced at their giving the fellow such a tussle. At last Max,
sorely scratched, bit, pinched, and every way aggravated, though of
course without a serious bruise, cried out “enough!” and the assailants
were ordered to quit him; but though the three O’Briens obeyed, the
three O’Regans hung on to him like leeches, and had to be dragged off.

“There now, you rascal,” cried the mate, “throw overboard another
Bible, and I’ll send you after it without a bowline.”

This event gave additional celebrity to the twins throughout the
vessel. That morning all six were invited to the quarter-deck, and
reviewed by the cabin-passengers, the ladies manifesting particular
interest in them, as they always do concerning twins, which some of
them show in public parks and gardens, by stopping to look at them, and
questioning their nurses.

“And were you all born at one time?” asked an old lady, letting her eye
run in wonder along the even file of white heads.

“Indeed, an’ we were,” said Teddy; “wasn’t we, mother?”

Many more questions were asked and answered, when a collection was
taken up for their benefit among these magnanimous cabin-passengers,
which resulted in starting all six boys in the world with a penny
apiece.

I never could look at these little fellows without an inexplicable
feeling coming over me; and though there was nothing so very remarkable
or unprecedented about them, except the singular coincidence of two
sisters simultaneously making the world such a generous present; yet,
the mere fact of there being twins always seemed curious; in fact, to
me at least, all twins are prodigies; and still I hardly know why this
should be; for all of us in our own persons furnish numerous examples
of the same phenomenon. Are not our thumbs twins? A regular Castor and
Pollux? And all of our fingers? Are not our arms, hands, legs, feet,
eyes, ears, all twins; born at one birth, and as much alike as they
possibly can be?

Can it be, that the Greek grammarians invented their dual number for
the particular benefit of twins?




CHAPTER LIV.
SOME SUPERIOR OLD NAIL-ROD AND _PIG-TAIL_


It has been mentioned how advantageously my shipmates disposed of their
tobacco in Liverpool; but it is to be related how those nefarious
commercial speculations of theirs reduced them to sad extremities in
the end.

True to their improvident character, and seduced by the high prices
paid for the weed in England, they had there sold off by far the
greater portion of what tobacco they had; even inducing the mate to
surrender the portion he had secured under lock and key by command of
the Custom-house officers. So that when the crew were about two weeks
out, on the homeward-bound passage, it became sorrowfully evident that
tobacco was at a premium.

Now, one of the favorite pursuits of sailors during a dogwatch below at
sea is cards; and though they do not understand whist, cribbage, and
games of that kidney, yet they are adepts at what is called
_“High-low-Jack-and-the-game,”_ which name, indeed, has a Jackish and
nautical flavor. Their stakes are generally so many plugs of tobacco,
which, like rouleaux of guineas, are piled on their chests when they
play. Judge, then, the wicked zest with which the Highlander’s crew now
shuffled and dealt the pack; and how the interest curiously and
invertedly increased, as the stakes necessarily became less and less;
and finally resolved themselves into _“chaws.”_

So absorbed, at last, did they become at this business, that some of
them, after being hard at work during a nightwatch on deck, would rob
themselves of rest below, in order to have a brush at the cards. And as
it is very difficult sleeping in the presence of gamblers; especially
if they chance to be sailors, whose conversation at all times is apt to
be boisterous; these fellows would often be driven out of the
forecastle by those who desired to rest. They were obliged to repair on
deck, and make a card-table of it; and invariably, in such cases, there
was a great deal of contention, a great many ungentlemanly charges of
nigging and cheating; and, now and then, a few parenthetical blows were
exchanged.

But this was not so much to be wondered at, seeing they could see but
very little, being provided with no light but that of a midnight sky;
and the cards, from long wear and rough usage, having become
exceedingly torn and tarry, so much so, that several members of the
four suits might have seceded from their respective clans, and formed
into a fifth tribe, under the name of _“Tar-spots.”_

Every day the tobacco grew scarcer and scarcer; till at last it became
necessary to adopt the greatest possible economy in its use. The
modicum constituting an ordinary _“chaw,”_ was made to last a whole
day; and at night, permission being had from the cook, this self-same
_“chaw”_ was placed in the oven of the stove, and there dried; so as to
do duty in a pipe.

In the end not a plug was to be had; and deprived of a solace and a
stimulus, on which sailors so much rely while at sea, the crew became
absent, moody, and sadly tormented with the hypos. They were something
like opium-smokers, suddenly cut off from their drug. They would sit on
their chests, forlorn and moping; with a steadfast sadness, eying the
forecastle lamp, at which they had lighted so many a pleasant pipe.
With touching eloquence they recalled those happier evenings—the time
of smoke and vapor; when, after a whole day’s delectable _“chawing,”_
they beguiled themselves with their genial, and most companionable
puffs.

One night, when they seemed more than usually cast down and
disconsolate, Blunt, the Irish cockney, started up suddenly with an
idea in his head—“Boys, let’s search under the bunks!” Bless you,
Blunt! what a happy conceit! Forthwith, the chests were dragged out;
the dark places explored; and two sticks of _nail-rod_ tobacco, and
several old _“chaws,”_ thrown aside by sailors on some previous voyage,
were their cheering reward. They were impartially divided by Jackson,
who, upon this occasion, acquitted himself to the satisfaction of all.

Their mode of dividing this tobacco was the rather curious one
generally adopted by sailors, when the highest possible degree of
impartiality is desirable. I will describe it, recommending its earnest
consideration to all heirs, who may hereafter divide an inheritance;
for if they adopted this nautical method, that universally slanderous
aphorism of Lavater would be forever rendered nugatory—“Expect _not to
understand any man till you have divided with him an inheritance.”_

The _nail-rods_ they cut as evenly as possible into as many parts as
there were men to be supplied; and this operation having been performed
in the presence of all, Jackson, placing the tobacco before him, his
face to the wall, and back to the company, struck one of the bits of
weed with his knife, crying out, “Whose is this?” Whereupon a
respondent, previously pitched upon, replied, at a venture, from the
opposite corner of the forecastle, “Blunt’s;” and to Blunt it went; and
so on, in like manner, till all were served.

I put it to you, lawyers—shade of Blackstone, I invoke you—if a more
impartial procedure could be imagined than this?

But the nail-rods and last-voyage _“chaws”_ were soon gone, and then,
after a short interval of comparative gayety, the men again drooped,
and relapsed into gloom.

They soon hit upon an ingenious device, however—but not altogether new
among seamen—to allay the severity of the depression under which they
languished. Ropes were unstranded, and the yarns picked apart; and, cut
up into small bits, were used as a substitute for the weed. Old ropes
were preferred; especially those which had long lain in the hold, and
had contracted an epicurean dampness, making still richer their
ancient, cheese-like flavor.

In the middle of most large ropes, there is a straight, central part,
round which the exterior strands are twisted. When in picking oakum,
upon various occasions, I have chanced, among the old junk used at such
times, to light upon a fragment of this species of rope, I have ever
taken, I know not what kind of strange, nutty delight in untwisting it
slowly, and gradually coming upon its deftly hidden and aromatic
_“heart;”_ for so this central piece is denominated.

It is generally of a rich, tawny, Indian hue, somewhat inclined to
luster; is exceedingly agreeable to the touch; diffuses a pungent odor,
as of an old dusty bottle of Port, newly opened above ground; and,
altogether, is an object which no man, who enjoys his dinners, could
refrain from hanging over, and caressing.

Nor is this delectable morsel of _old junk_ wanting in many
interesting, mournful, and tragic suggestions. Who can say in what
gales it may have been; in what remote seas it may have sailed? How
many stout masts of seventy-fours and frigates it may have staid in the
tempest? How deep it may have lain, as a hawser, at the bottom of
strange harbors? What outlandish fish may have nibbled at it in the
water, and what un-catalogued sea-fowl may have pecked at it, when
forming part of a lofty stay or a shroud?

Now, this particular part of the rope, this nice little “cut” it was,
that among the sailors was the most eagerly sought after. And getting
hold of a foot or two of old cable, they would cut into it lovingly, to
see whether it had any _“tenderloin.”_

For my own part, nevertheless, I can not say that this tit-bit was at
all an agreeable one in the mouth; however pleasant to the sight of an
antiquary, or to the nose of an epicure in nautical fragrancies.
Indeed, though possibly I might have been mistaken, I thought it had
rather an astringent, acrid taste; probably induced by the tar, with
which the flavor of all ropes is more or less vitiated. But the sailors
seemed to like it, and at any rate nibbled at it with great gusto. They
converted one pocket of their trowsers into a junk-shop, and when
solicited by a shipmate for a _“chaw,”_ would produce a small coil of
rope.

Another device adopted to alleviate their hardships, was the
substitution of dried tea-leaves, in place of tobacco, for their pipes.
No one has ever supped in a forecastle at sea, without having been
struck by the prodigious residuum of tea-leaves, or cabbage stalks, in
his tin-pot of bohea. There was no lack of material to supply every
pipe-bowl among us.

I had almost forgotten to relate the most noteworthy thing in this
matter; namely, that notwithstanding the general scarcity of the
genuine weed, Jackson was provided with a supply; nor did it give out,
until very shortly previous to our arrival in port.

In the lowest depths of despair at the loss of their precious solace,
when the sailors would be seated inconsolable as the Babylonish
captives, Jackson would sit cross-legged in his bunk, which was an
upper one, and enveloped in a cloud of tobacco smoke, would look down
upon the mourners below, with a sardonic grin at their forlornness.

He recalled to mind their folly in selling for filthy lucre, their
supplies of the weed; he painted their stupidity; he enlarged upon the
sufferings they had brought upon themselves; he exaggerated those
sufferings, and every way derided, reproached, twitted, and hooted at
them. No one dared to return his scurrilous animadversions, nor did any
presume to ask him to relieve their necessities out of his fullness. On
the contrary, as has been just related, they divided with him the
_nail-rods_ they found.

The extraordinary dominion of this one miserable Jackson, over twelve
or fourteen strong, healthy tars, is a riddle, whose solution must be
left to the philosophers.




CHAPTER LV.
DRAWING NIGH TO THE LAST SCENE IN JACKSON’S CAREER


The closing allusion to Jackson in the chapter preceding, reminds me of
a circumstance—which, perhaps, should have been mentioned before—that
after we had been at sea about ten days, he pronounced himself too
unwell to do duty, and accordingly went below to his bunk. And here,
with the exception of a few brief intervals of sunning himself in fine
weather, he remained on his back, or seated cross-legged, during the
remainder of the homeward-bound passage.

Brooding there, in his infernal gloom, though nothing but a castaway
sailor in canvas trowsers, this man was still a picture, worthy to be
painted by the dark, moody hand of Salvator. In any of that master’s
lowering sea-pieces, representing the desolate crags of Calabria, with
a midnight shipwreck in the distance, this Jackson’s would have been
the face to paint for the doomed vessel’s figurehead, seamed and
blasted by lightning.

Though the more sneaking and cowardly of my shipmates whispered among
themselves, that Jackson, sure of his wages, whether on duty or off,
was only feigning indisposition, nevertheless it was plain that, from
his excesses in Liverpool, the malady which had long fastened its fangs
in his flesh, was now gnawing into his vitals.

His cheek became thinner and yellower, and the bones projected like
those of a skull. His snaky eyes rolled in red sockets; nor could he
lift his hand without a violent tremor; while his racking cough many a
time startled us from sleep. Yet still in his tremulous grasp he swayed
his scepter, and ruled us all like a tyrant to the last.

The weaker and weaker he grew, the more outrageous became his treatment
of the crew. The prospect of the speedy and unshunable death now before
him, seemed to exasperate his misanthropic soul into madness; and as if
he had indeed sold it to Satan, he seemed determined to die with a
curse between his teeth.

I can never think of him, even now, reclining in his bunk, and with
short breaths panting out his maledictions, but I am reminded of that
misanthrope upon the throne of the world—the diabolical Tiberius at
Caprese; who even in his self-exile, imbittered by bodily pangs, and
unspeakable mental terrors only known to the damned on earth, yet did
not give over his blasphemies but endeavored to drag down with him to
his own perdition, all who came within the evil spell of his power. And
though Tiberius came in the succession of the Caesars, and though
unmatchable Tacitus has embalmed his carrion, yet do I account this
Yankee Jackson full as dignified a personage as he, and as well
meriting his lofty gallows in history; even though he was a nameless
vagabond without an epitaph, and none, but I, narrate what he was. For
there is no dignity in wickedness, whether in purple or rags; and hell
is a democracy of devils, where all are equals. There, Nero howls side
by side with his own malefactors. If Napoleon were truly but a martial
murderer, I pay him no more homage than I would a felon. Though
Milton’s Satan dilutes our abhorrence with admiration, it is only
because he is not a genuine being, but something altered from a genuine
original. We gather not from the four gospels alone, any high-raised
fancies concerning this Satan; we only know him from thence as the
personification of the essence of evil, which, who but pickpockets and
burglars will admire? But this takes not from the merit of our
high-priest of poetry; it only enhances it, that with such unmitigated
evil for his material, he should build up his most goodly structure.
But in historically canonizing on earth the condemned below, and
lifting up and lauding the illustrious damned, we do but make examples
of wickedness; and call upon ambition to do some great iniquity, and be
sure of fame.




CHAPTER LVI.
UNDER THE LEE OF THE LONG-BOAT, REDBURN AND HARRY HOLD CONFIDENTIAL
COMMUNION


A sweet thing is a song; and though the Hebrew captives hung their
harps on the willows, that they could not sing the melodies of
Palestine before the haughty beards of the Babylonians; yet, to
themselves, those melodies of other times and a distant land were as
sweet as the June dew on Hermon.

And poor Harry was as the Hebrews. He, too, had been carried away
captive, though his chief captor and foe was himself; and he, too, many
a night, was called upon to sing for those who through the day had
insulted and derided him.

His voice was just the voice to proceed from a small, silken person
like his; it was gentle and liquid, and meandered and tinkled through
the words of a song, like a musical brook that winds and wantons by
pied and pansied margins.

“_I_ can’t sing to-night”—sadly said Harry to the Dutchman, who with
his watchmates requested him to while away the middle watch with his
melody—“I can’t sing to-night. But, Wellingborough,” he whispered,—and
I stooped my ear,— “come _you_ with me under the lee of the long-boat,
and there I’ll hum you an air.”

It was _The Banks of the Blue Moselle._

Poor, poor Harry! and a thousand times friendless and forlorn! To be
singing that thing, which was only meant to be warbled by falling
fountains in gardens, or in elegant alcoves in drawing-rooms,—to be
singing it _here—here,_ as I live, under the tarry lee of our
long-boat.

But he sang, and sang, as I watched the waves, and peopled them all
with sprites, and cried _“chassez!” “hands across!”_ to the
multitudinous quadrilles, all danced on the moonlit, musical floor.

But though it went so hard with my friend to sing his songs to this
ruffian crew, whom he hated, even in his dreams, till the foam flew
from his mouth while he slept; yet at last I prevailed upon him to
master his feelings, and make them subservient to his interests. For so
delighted, even with the rudest minstrelsy, are sailors, that I well
knew Harry possessed a spell over them, which, for the time at least,
they could not resist; and it might induce them to treat with more
deference the being who was capable of yielding them such delight.
Carlo’s organ they did not so much care for; but the voice of my Bury
blade was an accordion in their ears.

So one night, on the windlass, he sat and sang; and from the ribald
jests so common to sailors, the men slid into silence at every verse.
Hushed, and more hushed they grew, till at last Harry sat among them
like Orpheus among the charmed leopards and tigers. Harmless now the
fangs with which they were wont to tear my zebra, and backward curled
in velvet paws; and fixed their once glaring eyes in fascinated and
fascinating brilliancy. Ay, still and hissingly all, for a time, they
relinquished their prey.

Now, during the voyage, the treatment of the crew threw Harry more and
more upon myself for companionship; and few can keep constant company
with another, without revealing some, at least, of their secrets; for
all of us yearn for sympathy, even if we do not for love; and to be
intellectually alone is a thing only tolerable to genius, whose
cherisher and inspirer is solitude.

But though my friend became more communicative concerning his past
career than ever he had been before, yet he did not make plain many
things in his hitherto but partly divulged history, which I was very
curious to know; and especially he never made the remotest allusion to
aught connected with our trip to London; while the oath of secrecy by
which he had bound me held my curiosity on that point a captive.
However, as it was, Harry made many very interesting disclosures; and
if he did not gratify me more in that respect, he atoned for it in a
measure, by dwelling upon the future, and the prospects, such as they
were, which the future held out to him.

He confessed that he had no money but a few shillings left from the
expenses of our return from London; that only by selling some more of
his clothing, could he pay for his first week’s board in New York; and
that he was altogether without any regular profession or business, upon
which, by his own exertions, he could securely rely for support. And
yet, he told me that he was determined never again to return to
England; and that somewhere in America he must work out his temporal
felicity.

“I have forgotten England,” he said, “and never more mean to think of
it; so tell me, Wellingborough, what am I to do in America?”

It was a puzzling question, and full of grief to me, who, young though
I was, had been well rubbed, curried, and ground down to fine powder in
the hopper of an evil fortune, and who therefore could sympathize with
one in similar circumstances. For though we may look grave and behave
kindly and considerately to a friend in calamity; yet, if we have never
actually experienced something like the woe that weighs him down, we
can not with the best grace proffer our sympathy. And perhaps there is
no true sympathy but between equals; and it may be, that we should
distrust that man’s sincerity, who stoops to condole with us.

So Harry and I, two friendless wanderers, beguiled many a long watch by
talking over our common affairs. But inefficient, as a benefactor, as I
certainly was; still, being an American, and returning to my home; even
as he was a stranger, and hurrying from his; therefore, I stood toward
him in the attitude of the prospective doer of the honors of my
country; I accounted him the nation’s guest. Hence, I esteemed it more
befitting, that I should rather talk with him, than he with me: that
_his_ prospects and plans should engage our attention, in preference to
my own.

Now, seeing that Harry was so brave a songster, and could sing such
bewitching airs: I suggested whether his musical talents could not be
turned to account. The thought struck him most favorably—“Gad, my boy,
you have hit it, you have,” and then he went on to mention, that in
some places in England, it was customary for two or three young men of
highly respectable families, of undoubted antiquity, but unfortunately
in lamentably decayed circumstances, and thread-bare coats—it was
customary for two or three young gentlemen, so situated, to obtain
their livelihood by their voices: coining their silvery songs into
silvery shillings.

They wandered from door to door, and rang the bell—Are _the ladies and
gentlemen in?_ Seeing them at least gentlemanly looking, if not
sumptuously appareled, the servant generally admitted them at once; and
when the people entered to greet them, their spokesman would rise with
a gentle bow, and a smile, and say, _We come, ladies and gentlemen, to
sing you a song: we are singers, at your service._ And so, without
waiting reply, forth they burst into song; and having most mellifluous
voices, enchanted and transported all auditors; so much so, that at the
conclusion of the entertainment, they very seldom failed to be well
recompensed, and departed with an invitation to return again, and make
the occupants of that dwelling once more delighted and happy.

“Could not something of this kind now, be done in New York?” said
Harry, “or are there no parlors with ladies in them, there?” he
anxiously added.

Again I assured him, as I had often done before, that New York was a
civilized and enlightened town; with a large population, fine streets,
fine houses, nay, plenty of omnibuses; and that for the most part, he
would almost think himself in England; so similar to England, in
essentials, was this outlandish America that haunted him.

I could not but be struck—and had I not been, from my birth, as it
were, a cosmopolite—I had been amazed at his skepticism with regard to
the civilization of my native land. A greater patriot than myself might
have resented his insinuations. He seemed to think that we Yankees
lived in wigwams, and wore bear-skins. After all, Harry was a spice of
a Cockney, and had shut up his Christendom in London.

Having then assured him, that I could see no reason, why he should not
play the troubadour in New York, as well as elsewhere; he suddenly
popped upon me the question, whether I would not join him in the
enterprise; as it would be quite out of the question to go alone on
such a business.

Said I, “My dear Bury, I have no more voice for a ditty, than a dumb
man has for an oration. Sing? Such Macadamized lungs have I, that I
think myself well off, that I can talk; let alone nightingaling.”

So that plan was quashed; and by-and-by Harry began to give up the idea
of singing himself into a livelihood.

“No, I won’t sing for my mutton,” said he—“what would Lady Georgiana
say?”

“If I could see her ladyship once, I might tell you, Harry,” returned
I, who did not exactly doubt him, but felt ill at ease for my bosom
friend’s conscience, when he alluded to his various noble and right
honorable friends and relations.

“But surely, Bury, my friend, you must write a clerkly hand, among your
other accomplishments; and _that_ at least, will be sure to help you.”

“I _do_ write a hand,” he gladly rejoined—“there, look at the
implement!—do you not think, that such a hand as _that_ might dot an
_i,_ or cross a _t,_ with a touching grace and tenderness?”

Indeed, but it did betoken a most excellent penmanship. It was small;
and the fingers were long and thin; the knuckles softly rounded; the
nails hemispherical at the base; and the smooth palm furnishing few
characters for an Egyptian fortune-teller to read. It was not as the
sturdy farmer’s hand of Cincinnatus, who followed the plough and guided
the state; but it was as the perfumed hand of Petronius Arbiter, that
elegant young buck of a Roman, who once cut great Seneca dead in the
forum.

His hand alone, would have entitled my Bury blade to the suffrages of
that Eastern potentate, who complimented Lord Byron upon his feline
fingers, declaring that they furnished indubitable evidence of his
noble birth. And so it did: for Lord Byron was as all the rest of
us—the son of a _man._ And so are the dainty-handed, and wee-footed
half-cast paupers in Lima; who, if their hands and feet were entitled
to consideration, would constitute the oligarchy of all Peru.

Folly and foolishness! to think that a gentleman is known by his
finger-nails, like Nebuchadnezzar, when his grew long in the pasture:
or that the badge of nobility is to be found in the smallness of the
foot, when even a fish has no foot at all!

Dandies! amputate yourselves, if you will; but know, and be assured,
oh, democrats, that, like a pyramid, a great man stands on a broad
base. It is only the brittle porcelain pagoda, that tottles on a toe.

But though Harry’s hand was lady-like looking, and had once been white
as the queen’s cambric handkerchief, and free from a stain as the
reputation of Diana; yet, his late pulling and hauling of halyards and
clew-lines, and his occasional dabbling in tar-pots and slush-shoes,
had somewhat subtracted from its original daintiness.

Often he ruefully eyed it.

Oh! hand! thought Harry, ah, hand! what have you come to? Is it seemly,
that you should be polluted with pitch, when you once handed countesses
to their coaches? Is _this_ the hand I kissed to the divine Georgiana?
with which I pledged Lady Blessington, and ratified my bond to Lord
Lovely? _This_ the hand that Georgiana clasped to her bosom, when she
vowed she was mine?—Out of sight, recreant and apostate!—deep
down—disappear in this foul monkey-jacket pocket where I thrust you!

After many long conversations, it was at last pretty well decided, that
upon our arrival at New York, some means should be taken among my few
friends there, to get Harry a place in a mercantile house, where he
might flourish his pen, and gently exercise his delicate digits, by
traversing some soft foolscap; in the same way that slim, pallid ladies
are gently drawn through a park for an airing.




CHAPTER LVII.
ALMOST A FAMINE


“Mammy! mammy! come and see the sailors eating out of little troughs,
just like our pigs at home.” Thus exclaimed one of the steerage
children, who at dinner-time was peeping down into the forecastle,
where the crew were assembled, helping themselves from the “kids,”
which, indeed, resemble hog-troughs not a little.

“Pigs, is it?” coughed Jackson, from his bunk, where he sat presiding
over the banquet, but not partaking, like a devil who had lost his
appetite by chewing sulphur.—“Pigs, is it?—and the day is close by, ye
spalpeens, when you’ll want to be after taking a sup at our troughs!”

This malicious prophecy proved true.

As day followed day without glimpse of shore or reef, and head winds
drove the ship back, as hounds a deer; the improvidence and
shortsightedness of the passengers in the steerage, with regard to
their outfits for the voyage, began to be followed by the inevitable
results.

Many of them at last went aft to the mate, saying that they had nothing
to eat, their provisions were expended, and they must be supplied from
the ship’s stores, or starve.

This was told to the captain, who was obliged to issue a ukase from the
cabin, that every steerage passenger, whose destitution was
demonstrable, should be given one sea-biscuit and two potatoes a day; a
sort of substitute for a muffin and a brace of poached eggs.

But this scanty ration was quite insufficient to satisfy their hunger:
hardly enough to satisfy the necessities of a healthy adult. The
consequence was, that all day long, and all through the night, scores
of the emigrants went about the decks, seeking what they might devour.
They plundered the chicken-coop; and disguising the fowls, cooked them
at the public galley. They made inroads upon the pig-pen in the boat,
and carried off a promising young shoat: _him_ they devoured raw, not
venturing to make an incognito of his carcass; they prowled about the
cook’s caboose, till he threatened them with a ladle of scalding water;
they waylaid the steward on his regular excursions from the cook to the
cabin; they hung round the forecastle, to rob the bread-barge; they
beset the sailors, like beggars in the streets, craving a mouthful in
the name of the Church.

At length, to such excesses were they driven, that the Grand Russian,
Captain Riga, issued another ukase, and to this effect: Whatsoever
emigrant is found guilty of stealing, the same shall be tied into the
rigging and flogged.

Upon this, there were secret movements in the steerage, which almost
alarmed me for the safety of the ship; but nothing serious took place,
after all; and they even acquiesced in, or did not resent, a singular
punishment which the captain caused to be inflicted upon a culprit of
their clan, as a substitute for a flogging. For no doubt he thought
that such rigorous discipline as _that_ might exasperate five hundred
emigrants into an insurrection.

A head was fitted to one of the large deck-tubs—the half of a cask; and
into this head a hole was cut; also, two smaller holes in the bottom of
the tub. The head—divided in the middle, across the diameter of the
orifice—was now fitted round the culprit’s neck; and he was forthwith
coopered up into the tub, which rested on his shoulders, while his legs
protruded through the holes in the bottom.

It was a burden to carry; but the man could walk with it; and so
ridiculous was his appearance, that spite of the indignity, he himself
laughed with the rest at the figure he cut.

“Now, Pat, my boy,” said the mate, “fill that big wooden belly of
yours, if you can.”

Compassionating his situation, our old “doctor” used to give him alms
of food, placing it upon the cask-head before him; till at last, when
the time for deliverance came, Pat protested against mercy, and would
fain have continued playing Diogenes in the tub for the rest of this
starving voyage.




CHAPTER LVIII.
THOUGH THE HIGHLANDER PUTS INTO NO HARBOR AS YET; SHE HERE AND THERE
LEAVES MANY OF HER PASSENGERS BEHIND


Although fast-sailing ships, blest with prosperous breezes, have
frequently made the run across the Atlantic in eighteen days; yet, it
is not uncommon for other vessels to be forty, or fifty, and even
sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety days, in making the same passage.
Though in the latter cases, some signal calamity or incapacity must
occasion so great a detention. It is also true, that generally the
passage out from America is shorter than the return; which is to be
ascribed to the prevalence of westerly winds.

We had been outside of Cape Clear upward of twenty days, still harassed
by head-winds, though with pleasant weather upon the whole, when we
were visited by a succession of rain storms, which lasted the greater
part of a week.

During the interval, the emigrants were obliged to remain below; but
this was nothing strange to some of them; who, not recovering, while at
sea, from their first attack of seasickness, seldom or never made their
appearance on deck, during the entire passage.

During the week, now in question, fire was only once made in the public
galley. This occasioned a good deal of domestic work to be done in the
steerage, which otherwise would have been done in the open air. When
the lulls of the rain-storms would intervene, some unusually cleanly
emigrant would climb to the deck, with a bucket of slops, to toss into
the sea. No experience seemed sufficient to instruct some of these
ignorant people in the simplest, and most elemental principles of
ocean-life. Spite of all lectures on the subject, several would
continue to shun the leeward side of the vessel, with their slops. One
morning, when it was blowing very fresh, a simple fellow pitched over a
gallon or two of something to windward. Instantly it flew back in his
face; and also, in the face of the chief mate, who happened to be
standing by at the time. The offender was collared, and shaken on the
spot; and ironically commanded, never, for the future, to throw any
thing to windward at sea, but fine ashes and scalding hot water.

During the frequent _hard blows_ we experienced, the hatchways on the
steerage were, at intervals, hermetically closed; sealing down in their
noisome den, those scores of human beings. It was something to be
marveled at, that the shocking fate, which, but a short time ago,
overtook the poor passengers in a Liverpool steamer in the Channel,
during similar stormy weather, and under similar treatment, did not
overtake some of the emigrants of the Highlander.

Nevertheless, it was, beyond question, this noisome confinement in so
close, unventilated, and crowded a den: joined to the deprivation of
sufficient food, from which many were suffering; which, helped by their
personal uncleanliness, brought on a malignant fever.

The first report was, that two persons were affected. No sooner was it
known, than the mate promptly repaired to the medicine-chest in the
cabin: and with the remedies deemed suitable, descended into the
steerage. But the medicines proved of no avail; the invalids rapidly
grew worse; and two more of the emigrants became infected.

Upon this, the captain himself went to see them; and returning, sought
out a certain alleged physician among the cabin-passengers; begging him
to wait upon the sufferers; hinting that, thereby, he might prevent the
disease from extending into the cabin itself. But this person denied
being a physician; and from fear of contagion—though he did not confess
that to be the motive—refused even to enter the steerage. The cases
increased: the utmost alarm spread through the ship: and scenes ensued,
over which, for the most part, a veil must be drawn; for such is the
fastidiousness of some readers, that, many times, they must lose the
most striking incidents in a narrative like mine.

Many of the panic-stricken emigrants would fain now have domiciled on
deck; but being so scantily clothed, the wretched weather—wet, cold,
and tempestuous—drove the best part of them again below. Yet any other
human beings, perhaps, would rather have faced the most outrageous
storm, than continued to breathe the pestilent air of the steerage. But
some of these poor people must have been so used to the most abasing
calamities, that the atmosphere of a lazar-house almost seemed their
natural air.

The first four cases happened to be in adjoining bunks; and the
emigrants who slept in the farther part of the steerage, threw up a
barricade in front of those bunks; so as to cut off communication. But
this was no sooner reported to the captain, than he ordered it to be
thrown down; since it could be of no possible benefit; but would only
make still worse, what was already direful enough.

It was not till after a good deal of mingled threatening and coaxing,
that the mate succeeded in getting the sailors below, to accomplish the
captain’s order.

The sight that greeted us, upon entering, was wretched indeed. It was
like entering a crowded jail. From the rows of rude bunks, hundreds of
meager, begrimed faces were turned upon us; while seated upon the
chests, were scores of unshaven men, smoking tea-leaves, and creating a
suffocating vapor. But this vapor was better than the native air of the
place, which from almost unbelievable causes, was fetid in the extreme.
In every corner, the females were huddled together, weeping and
lamenting; children were asking bread from their mothers, who had none
to give; and old men, seated upon the floor, were leaning back against
the heads of the water-casks, with closed eyes and fetching their
breath with a gasp.

At one end of the place was seen the barricade, hiding the invalids;
while—notwithstanding the crowd—in front of it was a clear area, which
the fear of contagion had left open.

“That bulkhead must come down,” cried the mate, in a voice that rose
above the din. “Take hold of it, boys.”

But hardly had we touched the chests composing it, when a crowd of
pale-faced, infuriated men rushed up; and with terrific howls, swore
they would slay us, if we did not desist.

“Haul it down!” roared the mate.

But the sailors fell back, murmuring something about merchant seamen
having no pensions in case of being maimed, and they had not shipped to
fight fifty to one. Further efforts were made by the mate, who at last
had recourse to entreaty; but it would not do; and we were obliged to
depart, without achieving our object.

About four o’clock that morning, the first four died. They were all
men; and the scenes which ensued were frantic in the extreme.
Certainly, the bottomless profound of the sea, over which we were
sailing, concealed nothing more frightful.

Orders were at once passed to bury the dead. But this was unnecessary.
By their own countrymen, they were torn from the clasp of their wives,
rolled in their own bedding, with ballast-stones, and with hurried
rites, were dropped into the ocean.

At this time, ten more men had caught the disease; and with a degree of
devotion worthy all praise, the mate attended them with his medicines;
but the captain did not again go down to them.

It was all-important now that the steerage should be purified; and had
it not been for the rains and squalls, which would have made it madness
to turn such a number of women and children upon the wet and
unsheltered decks, the steerage passengers would have been ordered
above, and their den have been given a thorough cleansing. But, for the
present, this was out of the question. The sailors peremptorily refused
to go among the defilements to remove them; and so besotted were the
greater part of the emigrants themselves, that though the necessity of
the case was forcibly painted to them, they would not lift a hand to
assist in what seemed their own salvation.

The panic in the cabin was now very great; and for fear of contagion to
themselves, the cabin passengers would fain have made a prisoner of the
captain, to prevent him from going forward beyond the mainmast. Their
clamors at last induced him to tell the two mates, that for the present
they must sleep and take their meals elsewhere than in their old
quarters, which communicated with the cabin.

On land, a pestilence is fearful enough; but there, many can flee from
an infected city; whereas, in a ship, you are locked and bolted in the
very hospital itself. Nor is there any possibility of escape from it;
and in so small and crowded a place, no precaution can effectually
guard against contagion.

Horrible as the sights of the steerage now were, the cabin, perhaps,
presented a scene equally despairing. Many, who had seldom prayed
before, now implored the merciful heavens, night and day, for fair
winds and fine weather. Trunks were opened for Bibles; and at last,
even prayer-meetings were held over the very table across which the
loud jest had been so often heard.

Strange, though almost universal, that the seemingly nearer prospect of
that death which any body at any time may die, should produce these
spasmodic devotions, when an everlasting Asiatic Cholera is forever
thinning our ranks; and die by death we all must at last.

On the second day, seven died, one of whom was the little tailor; on
the third, four; on the fourth, six, of whom one was the Greenland
sailor, and another, a woman in the cabin, whose death, however, was
afterward supposed to have been purely induced by her fears. These last
deaths brought the panic to its height; and sailors, officers,
cabin-passengers, and emigrants—all looked upon each other like lepers.
All but the only true leper among us—the mariner Jackson, who seemed
elated with the thought, that for _him—_already in the deadly clutches
of another disease—no danger was to be apprehended from a fever which
only swept off the comparatively healthy. Thus, in the midst of the
despair of the healthful, this incurable invalid was not cast down;
not, at least, by the same considerations that appalled the rest.

And still, beneath a gray, gloomy sky, the doomed craft beat on; now on
this tack, now on that; battling against hostile blasts, and drenched
in rain and spray; scarcely making an inch of progress toward her port.

On the sixth morning, the weather merged into a gale, to which we
stripped our ship to a storm-stay-sail. In ten hours’ time, the waves
ran in mountains; and the Highlander rose and fell like some vast buoy
on the water. Shrieks and lamentations were driven to leeward, and
drowned in the roar of the wind among the cordage; while we gave to the
gale the blackened bodies of five more of the dead.

But as the dying departed, the places of two of them were filled in the
rolls of humanity, by the birth of two infants, whom the plague, panic,
and gale had hurried into the world before their time. The first cry of
one of these infants, was almost simultaneous with the splash of its
father’s body in the sea. Thus we come and we go. But, surrounded by
death, both mothers and babes survived.

At midnight, the wind went down; leaving a long, rolling sea; and, for
the first time in a week, a clear, starry sky.

In the first morning-watch, I sat with Harry on the windlass, watching
the billows; which, seen in the night, seemed real hills, upon which
fortresses might have been built; and real valleys, in which villages,
and groves, and gardens, might have nestled. It was like a landscape in
Switzerland; for down into those dark, purple glens, often tumbled the
white foam of the wave-crests, like avalanches; while the seething and
boiling that ensued, seemed the swallowing up of human beings.

By the afternoon of the next day this heavy sea subsided; and we bore
down on the waves, with all our canvas set; stun’-sails alow and aloft;
and our best steersman at the helm; the captain himself at his
elbow;—bowling along, with a fair, cheering breeze over the taffrail.

The decks were cleared, and swabbed bone-dry; and then, all the
emigrants who were not invalids, poured themselves out on deck,
snuffing the delightful air, spreading their damp bedding in the sun,
and regaling themselves with the generous charity of the captain, who
of late had seen fit to increase their allowance of food. A detachment
of them now joined a band of the crew, who proceeding into the
steerage, with buckets and brooms, gave it a thorough cleansing,
sending on deck, I know not how many bucketsful of defilements. It was
more like cleaning out a stable, than a retreat for men and women. This
day we buried three; the next day one, and then the pestilence left us,
with seven convalescent; who, placed near the opening of the hatchway,
soon rallied under the skillful treatment, and even tender care of the
mate.

But even under this favorable turn of affairs, much apprehension was
still entertained, lest in crossing the Grand Banks of Newfoundland,
the fogs, so generally encountered there, might bring on a return of
the fever. But, to the joy of all hands, our fair wind still held on;
and we made a rapid run across these dreaded shoals, and southward
steered for New York.

Our days were now fair and mild, and though the wind abated, yet we
still ran our course over a pleasant sea. The steerage-passengers—at
least by far the greater number—wore a still, subdued aspect, though a
little cheered by the genial air, and the hopeful thought of soon
reaching their port. But those who had lost fathers, husbands, wives,
or children, needed no crape, to reveal to others, who they were. Hard
and bitter indeed was their lot; for with the poor and desolate, grief
is no indulgence of mere sentiment, however sincere, but a gnawing
reality, that eats into their vital beings; they have no kind
condolers, and bland physicians, and troops of sympathizing friends;
and they must toil, though to-morrow be the burial, and their
pallbearers throw down the hammer to lift up the coffin.

How, then, with these emigrants, who, three thousand miles from home,
suddenly found themselves deprived of brothers and husbands, with but a
few pounds, or perhaps but a few shillings, to buy food in a strange
land?

As for the passengers in the cabin, who now so jocund as they? drawing
nigh, with their long purses and goodly portmanteaus to the promised
land, without fear of fate. One and all were generous and gay, the
jelly-eyed old gentleman, before spoken of, gave a shilling to the
steward.

The lady who had died, was an elderly person, an American, returning
from a visit to an only brother in London. She had no friend or
relative on board, hence, as there is little mourning for a stranger
dying among strangers, her memory had been buried with her body.

But the thing most worthy of note among these now light-hearted people
in feathers, was the gay way in which some of them bantered others,
upon the panic into which nearly all had been thrown.

And since, if the extremest fear of a crowd in a panic of peril, proves
grounded on causes sufficient, they must then indeed come to
perish;—therefore it is, that at such times they must make up their
minds either to die, or else survive to be taunted by their fellow-men
with their fear. For except in extraordinary instances of exposure,
there are few living men, who, at bottom, are not very slow to admit
that any other living men have ever been very much nearer death than
themselves. Accordingly, _craven_ is the phrase too often applied to
any one who, with however good reason, has been appalled at the
prospect of sudden death, and yet lived to escape it. Though, should he
have perished in conformity with his fears, not a syllable of _craven_
would you hear. This is the language of one, who more than once has
beheld the scenes, whence these principles have been deduced. The
subject invites much subtle speculation; for in every being’s ideas of
death, and his behavior when it suddenly menaces him, lies the best
index to his life and his faith. Though the Christian era had not then
begun, Socrates died the death of the Christian; and though Hume was
not a Christian in theory, yet he, too, died the death of the
Christian,—humble, composed, without bravado; and though the most
skeptical of philosophical skeptics, yet full of that firm, creedless
faith, that embraces the spheres. Seneca died dictating to posterity;
Petronius lightly discoursing of essences and love-songs; and Addison,
calling upon Christendom to behold how calmly a Christian could die;
but not even the last of these three, perhaps, died the best death of
the Christian.

The cabin passenger who had used to read prayers while the rest kneeled
against the transoms and settees, was one of the merry young sparks,
who had occasioned such agonies of jealousy to the poor tailor, now no
more. In his rakish vest, and dangling watch-chain, this same youth,
with all the awfulness of fear, had led the earnest petitions of his
companions; supplicating mercy, where before he had never solicited the
slightest favor. More than once had he been seen thus engaged by the
observant steersman at the helm: who looked through the little glass in
the cabin bulk-head.

But this youth was an April man; the storm had departed; and now he
shone in the sun, none braver than he.

One of his jovial companions ironically advised him to enter into holy
orders upon his arrival in New York.

“Why so?” said the other, “have I such an orotund voice?”

“No;” profanely returned his friend—“but you are a coward—just the man
to be a parson, and pray.”

However this narrative of the circumstances attending the fever among
the emigrants on the Highland may appear; and though these things
happened so long ago; yet just such events, nevertheless, are perhaps
taking place to-day. But the only account you obtain of such events, is
generally contained in a newspaper paragraph, under the shipping-head.
_There_ is the obituary of the destitute dead, who die on the sea. They
die, like the billows that break on the shore, and no more are heard or
seen. But in the events, thus merely initialized in the catalogue of
passing occurrences, and but glanced at by the readers of news, who are
more taken up with paragraphs of fuller flavor; what a world of life
and death, what a world of humanity and its woes, lies shrunk into a
three-worded sentence!

You see no plague-ship driving through a stormy sea; you hear no groans
of despair; you see no corpses thrown over the bulwarks; you mark not
the wringing hands and torn hair of widows and orphans:—all is a blank.
And one of these blanks I have but filled up, in recounting the details
of the Highlander’s calamity.

Besides that natural tendency, which hurries into oblivion the last
woes of the poor; other causes combine to suppress the detailed
circumstances of disasters like these. Such things, if widely known,
operate unfavorably to the ship, and make her a bad name; and to avoid
detention at quarantine, a captain will state the case in the most
palliating light, and strive to hush it up, as much as he can.

In no better place than this, perhaps, can a few words be said,
concerning emigrant ships in general.

Let us waive that agitated national topic, as to whether such
multitudes of foreign poor should be landed on our American shores; let
us waive it, with the one only thought, that if they can get here, they
have God’s right to come; though they bring all Ireland and her
miseries with them. For the whole world is the patrimony of the whole
world; there is no telling who does not own a stone in the Great Wall
of China. But we waive all this; and will only consider, how best the
emigrants can come hither, since come they do, and come they must and
will.

Of late, a law has been passed in Congress, restricting ships to a
certain number of emigrants, according to a certain rate. If this law
were enforced, much good might be done; and so also might much good be
done, were the English law likewise enforced, concerning the fixed
supply of food for every emigrant embarking from Liverpool. But it is
hardly to be believed, that either of these laws is observed.

But in all respects, no legislation, even nominally, reaches the hard
lot of the emigrant. What ordinance makes it obligatory upon the
captain of a ship, to supply the steerage-passengers with decent
lodgings, and give them light and air in that foul den, where they are
immured, during a long voyage across the Atlantic? What ordinance
necessitates him to place the _galley,_ or steerage-passengers’ stove,
in a dry place of shelter, where the emigrants can do their cooking
during a storm, or wet weather? What ordinance obliges him to give them
more room on deck, and let them have an occasional run fore and
aft?—There is no law concerning these things. And if there was, who but
some Howard in office would see it enforced? and how seldom is there a
Howard in office!

We talk of the Turks, and abhor the cannibals; but may not some of
_them,_ go to heaven, before some of _us?_ We may have civilized bodies
and yet barbarous souls. We are blind to the real sights of this world;
deaf to its voice; and dead to its death. And not till we know, that
one grief outweighs ten thousand joys, will we become what Christianity
is striving to make us.




CHAPTER LIX.
THE LAST END OF JACKSON


“Off Cape Cod!” said the steward, coming forward from the quarter-deck,
where the captain had just been taking his noon observation; sweeping
the vast horizon with his quadrant, like a dandy circumnavigating the
dress-circle of an amphitheater with his glass.

_Off Cape Cod!_ and in the shore-bloom that came to us— even from that
desert of sand-hillocks—methought I could almost distinguish the
fragrance of the rose-bush my sisters and I had planted, in our far
inland garden at home. Delicious odors are those of our mother Earth;
which like a flower-pot set with a thousand shrubs, greets the eager
voyager from afar.

The breeze was stiff, and so drove us along that we turned over two
broad, blue furrows from our bows, as we plowed the watery prairie. By
night it was a reef-topsail-breeze; but so impatient was the captain to
make his port before a shift of wind overtook us, that even yet we
carried a main-topgallant-sail, though the light mast sprung like a
switch.

In the second dog-watch, however, the breeze became such, that at last
the order was given to douse the top-gallant-sail, and clap a reef into
all three top-sails.

While the men were settling away the halyards on deck, and before they
had begun to haul out the reef-tackles, to the surprise of several,
Jackson came up from the forecastle, and, for the first time in four
weeks or more, took hold of a rope.

Like most seamen, who during the greater part of a voyage, have been
off duty from sickness, he was, perhaps, desirous, just previous to
entering port, of reminding the captain of his existence, and also that
he expected his wages; but, alas! his wages proved the wages of sin.

At no time could he better signalize his disposition to work, than upon
an occasion like the present; which generally attracts every soul on
deck, from the captain to the child in the steerage.

His aspect was damp and death-like; the blue hollows of his eyes were
like vaults full of snakes; and issuing so unexpectedly from his dark
tomb in the forecastle, he looked like a man raised from the dead.

Before the sailors had made fast the reef-tackle, Jackson was tottering
up the rigging; thus getting the start of them, and securing his place
at the extreme weather-end of the topsail-yard—which in reefing is
accounted the post of honor. For it was one of the characteristics of
this man, that though when on duty he would shy away from mere dull
work in a calm, yet in tempest-time he always claimed the van, and
would yield it to none; and this, perhaps, was one cause of his
unbounded dominion over the men.

Soon, we were all strung along the main-topsail-yard; the ship rearing
and plunging under us, like a runaway steed; each man gripping his
reef-point, and sideways leaning, dragging the sail over toward
Jackson, whose business it was to confine the reef corner to the yard.

His hat and shoes were off; and he rode the yard-arm end, leaning
backward to the gale, and pulling at the earing-rope, like a bridle. At
all times, this is a moment of frantic exertion with sailors, whose
spirits seem then to partake of the commotion of the elements, as they
hang in the gale, between heaven and earth; and _then_ it is, too, that
they are the most profane.

“Haul out to windward!” coughed Jackson, with a blasphemous cry, and he
threw himself back with a violent strain upon the bridle in his hand.
But the wild words were hardly out of his mouth, when his hands dropped
to his side, and the bellying sail was spattered with a torrent of
blood from his lungs.

As the man next him stretched out his arm to save, Jackson fell
headlong from the yard, and with a long seethe, plunged like a diver
into the sea.

It was when the ship had rolled to windward, which, with the long
projection of the yard-arm over the side, made him strike far out upon
the water. His fall was seen by the whole upward-gazing crowd on deck,
some of whom were spotted with the blood that trickled from the sail,
while they raised a spontaneous cry, so shrill and wild, that a blind
man might have known something deadly had happened.

Clutching our reef-points, we hung over the stick, and gazed down to
the one white, bubbling spot, which had closed over the head of our
shipmate; but the next minute it was brewed into the common yeast of
the waves, and Jackson never arose. We waited a few minutes, expecting
an order to descend, haul back the fore-yard, and man the boat; but
instead of that, the next sound that greeted us was, “Bear a hand, and
reef away, men!” from the mate.

Indeed, upon reflection, it would have been idle to attempt to save
Jackson; for besides that he must have been dead, ere he struck the
sea—and if he had not been dead then, the first immersion must have
driven his soul from his lacerated lungs—our jolly-boat would have
taken full fifteen minutes to launch into the waves.

And here it should be said, that the thoughtless security in which too
many sea-captains indulge, would, in case of some sudden disaster
befalling the Highlander, have let us all drop into our graves.

Like most merchant ships, we had but two boats: the longboat and the
jolly-boat. The long boat, by far the largest and stoutest of the two,
was permanently bolted down to the deck, by iron bars attached to its
sides. It was almost as much of a fixture as the vessel’s keel. It was
filled with pigs, fowls, firewood, and coals. Over this the jolly-boat
was capsized without a _thole-pin_ in the gunwales; its bottom
bleaching and cracking in the sun.

Judge, then, what promise of salvation for us, had we shipwrecked; yet
in this state, one merchant ship out of three, keeps its boats. To be
sure, no vessel full of emigrants, by any possible precautions, could
in case of a fatal disaster at sea, hope to save the tenth part of the
souls on board; yet provision should certainly be made for a handful of
survivors, to carry home the tidings of her loss; for even in the worst
of the calamities that befell patient Job, some _one_ at least of his
servants escaped to report it.

In a way that I never could fully account for, the sailors, in my
hearing at least, and Harry’s, never made the slightest allusion to the
departed Jackson. One and all they seemed tacitly to unite in hushing
up his memory among them. Whether it was, that the severity of the
bondage under which this man held every one of them, did really corrode
in their secret hearts, that they thought to repress the recollection
of a thing so degrading, I can not determine; but certain it was, that
_his_ death was _their_ deliverance; which they celebrated by an
elevation of spirits, unknown before. Doubtless, this was to be in part
imputed, however, to their now drawing near to their port.




CHAPTER LX.
HOME AT LAST


Next day was Sunday; and the mid-day sun shone upon a glassy sea.

After the uproar of the breeze and the gale, this profound, pervading
calm seemed suited to the tranquil spirit of a day, which, in godly
towns, makes quiet vistas of the most tumultuous thoroughfares.

The ship lay gently rolling in the soft, subdued ocean swell; while all
around were faint white spots; and nearer to, broad, milky patches,
betokening the vicinity of scores of ships, all bound to one common
port, and tranced in one common calm. Here the long, devious wakes from
Europe, Africa, India, and Peru converged to a line, which braided them
all in one.

Full before us quivered and danced, in the noon-day heat and mid-air,
the green heights of New Jersey; and by an optical delusion, the blue
sea seemed to flow under them.

The sailors whistled and whistled for a wind; the impatient
cabin-passengers were arrayed in their best; and the emigrants
clustered around the bows, with eyes intent upon the long-sought land.

But leaning over, in a reverie, against the side, my Carlo gazed down
into the calm, violet sea, as if it were an eye that answered his own;
and turning to Harry, said, “This America’s skies must be down in the
sea; for, looking down in this water, I behold what, in Italy, we also
behold overhead. Ah! after all, I find my Italy somewhere, wherever I
go. I even found it in rainy Liverpool.”

Presently, up came a dainty breeze, wafting to us a white wing from the
shore—the pilot-boat! Soon a monkey-jacket mounted the side, and was
beset by the captain and cabin people for news. And out of bottomless
pockets came bundles of newspapers, which were eagerly caught by the
throng.

The captain now abdicated in the pilot’s favor, who proved to be a
tiger of a fellow, keeping us hard at work, pulling and hauling the
braces, and trimming the ship, to catch the least _cat’s-paw_ of wind.

When, among sea-worn people, a strange man from shore suddenly stands
among them, with the smell of the land in his beard, it conveys a
realization of the vicinity of the green grass, that not even the
distant sight of the shore itself can transcend.

The steerage was now as a bedlam; trunks and chests were locked and
tied round with ropes; and a general washing and rinsing of faces and
hands was beheld. While this was going on, forth came an order from the
quarter-deck, for every bed, blanket, bolster, and bundle of straw in
the steerage to be committed to the deep.—A command that was received
by the emigrants with dismay, and then with wrath. But they were
assured, that this was indispensable to the getting rid of an otherwise
long detention of some weeks at the quarantine. They therefore
reluctantly complied; and overboard went pallet and pillow. Following
them, went old pots and pans, bottles and baskets. So, all around, the
sea was strewn with stuffed bed-ticks, that limberly floated on the
waves—couches for all mermaids who were not fastidious. Numberless
things of this sort, tossed overboard from emigrant ships nearing the
harbor of New York, drift in through the Narrows, and are deposited on
the shores of Staten Island; along whose eastern beach I have often
walked, and speculated upon the broken jugs, torn pillows, and
dilapidated baskets at my feet.

A second order was now passed for the emigrants to muster their forces,
and give the steerage a final, thorough cleaning with sand and water.
And to this they were incited by the same warning which had induced
them to make an offering to Neptune of their bedding. The place was
then fumigated, and dried with pans of coals from the galley; so that
by evening, no stranger would have imagined, from her appearance, that
the Highlander had made otherwise than a tidy and prosperous voyage.
Thus, some sea-captains take good heed that benevolent citizens shall
not get a glimpse of the true condition of the steerage while at sea.

That night it again fell calm; but next morning, though the wind was
somewhat against us, we set sail for the Narrows; and making short
tacks, at last ran through, almost bringing our jib-boom over one of
the forts.

An early shower had refreshed the woods and fields, that glowed with a
glorious green; and to our salted lungs, the land breeze was spiced
with aromas. The steerage passengers almost neighed with delight, like
horses brought back to spring pastures; and every eye and ear in the
Highlander was full of the glad sights and sounds of the shore.

No more did we think of the gale and the plague; nor turn our eyes
upward to the stains of blood, still visible on the topsail, whence
Jackson had fallen; but we fixed our gaze on the orchards and meads,
and like thirsty men, drank in all their dew.

On the Staten Island side, a white staff displayed a pale yellow flag,
denoting the habitation of the quarantine officer; for as if to
symbolize the yellow fever itself, and strike a panic and premonition
of the black vomit into every beholder, all quarantines all over the
world, taint the air with the streamings of their fever-flag.

But though the long rows of white-washed hospitals on the hill side
were now in plain sight, and though scores of ships were here lying at
anchor, yet no boat came off to us; and to our surprise and delight, on
we sailed, past a spot which every one had dreaded. How it was that
they thus let us pass without boarding us, we never could learn.

Now rose the city from out the bay, and one by one, her spires pierced
the blue; while thick and more thick, ships, brigs, schooners, and sail
boats, thronged around. We saw the Hartz Forest of masts and black
rigging stretching along the East River; and northward, up the stately
old Hudson, covered with white sloop-sails like fleets of swans, we
caught a far glimpse of the purple Palisades.

Oh! he who has never been afar, let him once go from home, to know what
home is. For as you draw nigh again to your old native river, he seems
to pour through you with all his tides, and in your enthusiasm, you
swear to build altars like mile-stones, along both his sacred banks.

Like the Czar of all the Russias, and Siberia to boot, Captain Riga,
telescope in hand, stood on the poop, pointing out to the passengers,
Governor’s Island, Castle Garden, and the Battery.

“And _that”_ said he, pointing out a vast black hull which, like a
shark, showed tiers of teeth, _“that,_ ladies, is a
line-of-battle-ship, the North Carolina.”

“Oh, dear!”—and “Oh my!”—ejaculated the ladies, and— “Lord, save us,”
responded an old gentleman, who was a member of the Peace Society.

Hurra! hurra! and ten thousand times hurra! down goes our old anchor,
fathoms down into the free and independent Yankee mud, one handful of
which was now worth a broad manor in England.

The Whitehall boats were around us, and soon, our cabin passengers were
all off, gay as crickets, and bound for a late dinner at the Astor
House; where, no doubt, they fired off a salute of champagne corks in
honor of their own arrival. Only a very few of the steerage passengers,
however, could afford to pay the high price the watermen demanded for
carrying them ashore; so most of them remained with us till morning.
But nothing could restrain our Italian boy, Carlo, who, promising the
watermen to pay them with his music, was triumphantly rowed ashore,
seated in the stern of the boat, his organ before him, and something
like “Hail Columbia!” his tune. We gave him three rapturous cheers, and
we never saw Carlo again.

Harry and I passed the greater part of the night walking the deck, and
gazing at the thousand lights of the city.

At sunrise, we _warped_ into a berth at the foot of Wall-street, and
knotted our old ship, stem and stern, to the pier. But that knotting of
_her,_ was the unknotting of the bonds of the sailors, among whom, it
is a maxim, that the ship once fast to the wharf, they are free. So
with a rush and a shout, they bounded ashore, followed by the
tumultuous crowd of emigrants, whose friends, day-laborers and
housemaids, stood ready to embrace them.

But in silent gratitude at the end of a voyage, almost equally
uncongenial to both of us, and so bitter to one, Harry and I sat on a
chest in the forecastle. And now, the ship that we had loathed, grew
lovely in our eyes, which lingered over every familiar old timber; for
the scene of suffering is a scene of joy when the suffering is past;
and the silent reminiscence of hardships departed, is sweeter than the
presence of delight.




CHAPTER LXI.
REDBURN AND HARRY, ARM IN ARM, IN HARBOR


There we sat in that tarry old den, the only inhabitants of the
deserted old ship, but the mate and the rats.

At last, Harry went to his chest, and drawing out a few shillings,
proposed that we should go ashore, and return with a supper, to eat in
the forecastle. Little else that was eatable being for sale in the
paltry shops along the wharves, we bought several pies, some doughnuts,
and a bottle of ginger-pop, and thus supplied we made merry. For to us,
whose very mouths were become pickled and puckered, with the continual
flavor of briny beef, those pies and doughnuts were most delicious. And
as for the ginger-pop, why, that ginger-pop was divine! I have
reverenced ginger-pop ever since.

We kept late hours that night; for, delightful certainty! placed beyond
all doubt—like royal landsmen, we were masters of the watches of the
night, and no _starb-o-leens ahoy!_ would annoy us again.

“All night in! think of _that,_ Harry, my friend!”

“Ay, Wellingborough, it’s enough to keep me awake forever, to think I
may now sleep as long as I please.”

We turned out bright and early, and then prepared for the shore, first
stripping to the waist, for a toilet.

“I shall never get these confounded tar-stains out of my fingers,”
cried Harry, rubbing them hard with a bit of oakum, steeped in strong
suds. “No! they will _not_ come out, and I’m ruined for life. Look at
my hand once, Wellingborough!”

It was indeed a sad sight. Every finger nail, like mine, was dyed of a
rich, russet hue; looking something like bits of fine tortoise shell.

“Never mind, Harry,” said I—“You know the ladies of the east steep the
tips of their fingers in some golden dye.”

“And by Plutus,” cried Harry—“I’d steep mine up to the armpits in gold;
since you talk about _that._ But never mind, I’ll swear I’m just from
Persia, my boy.”

We now arrayed ourselves in our best, and sallied ashore; and, at once,
I piloted Harry to the sign of a Turkey Cock in Fulton-street, kept by
one Sweeny, a place famous for cheap Souchong, and capital buckwheat
cakes.

“Well, gentlemen, what will you have?”—said a waiter, as we seated
ourselves at a table.

“_Gentlemen!_” whispered Harry to me—“_gentlemen!_—hear him!—I say now,
Redburn, they didn’t talk to us that way on board the old Highlander.
By heaven, I begin to feel my straps again:—Coffee and hot rolls,” he
added aloud, crossing his legs like a lord, “and fellow—come back—bring
us a venison-steak.”

“Haven’t got it, gentlemen.”

“Ham and eggs,” suggested I, whose mouth was watering at the
recollection of that particular dish, which I had tasted at the sign of
the Turkey Cock before. So ham and eggs it was; and royal coffee, and
imperial toast.

But the butter!

“Harry, did you ever taste such butter as this before?”

“Don’t say a word,”—said Harry, spreading his tenth slice of toast “I’m
going to turn dairyman, and keep within the blessed savor of butter, so
long as I live.”

We made a breakfast, never to be forgotten; paid our bill with a
flourish, and sallied into the street, like two goodly galleons of
gold, bound from Acapulco to Old Spain.

“Now,” said Harry, “lead on; and let’s see something of these United
States of yours. I’m ready to pace from Maine to Florida; ford the
Great Lakes; and jump the River Ohio, if it comes in the way. Here,
take my arm;—lead on.”

Such was the miraculous change, that had now come over him. It reminded
me of his manner, when we had started for London, from the sign of the
Golden Anchor, in Liverpool.

He was, indeed, in most wonderful spirits; at which I could not help
marveling; considering the cavity in his pockets; and that he was a
stranger in the land.

By noon he had selected his boarding-house, a private establishment,
where they did not charge much for their board, and where the
landlady’s butcher’s bill was not very large.

Here, at last, I left him to get his chest from the ship; while I
turned up town to see my old friend Mr. Jones, and learn what had
happened during my absence.

With one hand, Mr. Jones shook mine most cordially; and with the other,
gave me some letters, which I eagerly devoured. Their purport compelled
my departure homeward; and I at once sought out Harry to inform him.

Strange, but even the few hours’ absence which had intervened; during
which, Harry had been left to himself, to stare at strange streets, and
strange faces, had wrought a marked change in his countenance. He was a
creature of the suddenest impulses. Left to himself, the strange
streets seemed now to have reminded him of his friendless condition;
and I found him with a very sad eye; and his right hand groping in his
pocket.

“Where am I going to dine, this day week?”—he slowly said. “What’s to
be done, Wellingborough?”

And when I told him that the next afternoon I must leave him; he looked
downhearted enough. But I cheered him as well as I could; though
needing a little cheering myself; even though I _had_ got home again.
But no more about that.

Now, there was a young man of my acquaintance in the city, much my
senior, by the name of Goodwell; and a good natured fellow he was; who
had of late been engaged as a clerk in a large forwarding house in
South-street; and it occurred to me, that he was just the man to
befriend Harry, and procure him a place. So I mentioned the thing to my
comrade; and we called upon Goodwell.

I saw that he was impressed by the handsome exterior of my friend; and
in private, making known the case, he faithfully promised to do his
best for him; though the times, he said, were quite dull.

That evening, Goodwell, Harry, and I, perambulated the streets, three
abreast:—Goodwell spending his money freely at the oyster-saloons;
Harry full of allusions to the London Clubhouses: and myself
contributing a small quota to the general entertainment.

Next morning, we proceeded to business.

Now, I did not expect to draw much of a salary from the ship; so as to
retire for life on the profits of _my first voyage;_ but nevertheless,
I thought that a dollar or two might be coming. For dollars are
valuable things; and should not be overlooked, when they are owing.
Therefore, as the second morning after our arrival, had been set apart
for paying off the crew, Harry and I made our appearance on ship-board,
with the rest. We were told to enter the cabin; and once again I found
myself, after an interval of four months, and more, surrounded by its
mahogany and maple.

Seated in a sumptuous arm-chair, behind a lustrous, inlaid desk, sat
Captain Riga, arrayed in his City Hotel suit, looking magisterial as
the Lord High Admiral of England. Hat in hand, the sailors stood
deferentially in a semicircle before him, while the captain held the
ship-papers in his hand, and one by one called their names; and in
mellow bank notes—beautiful sight!—paid them their wages.

Most of them had less than ten, a few twenty, and two, thirty dollars
coming to them; while the old cook, whose piety proved profitable in
restraining him from the expensive excesses of most seafaring men, and
who had taken no pay in advance, had the goodly round sum of seventy
dollars as his due.

Seven ten dollar bills! each of which, as I calculated at the time, was
worth precisely one hundred dimes, which were equal to one thousand
cents, which were again subdivisible into fractions. So that he now
stepped into a fortune of seventy thousand American _“mitts.”_ Only
seventy dollars, after all; but then, it has always seemed to me, that
stating amounts in sounding fractional sums, conveys a much fuller
notion of their magnitude, than by disguising their immensity in such
aggregations of value, as doubloons, sovereigns, and dollars. Who would
not rather be worth 125,000 francs in Paris, than only £5000 in London,
though the intrinsic value of the two sums, in round numbers, is pretty
much the same.

With a scrape of the foot, and such a bow as only a negro can make, the
old cook marched off with his fortune; and I have no doubt at once
invested it in a grand, underground oyster-cellar.

The other sailors, after counting their cash very carefully, and seeing
all was right, and not a bank-note was dog-eared, in which case they
would have demanded another: for they are not to be taken in and
cheated, your sailors, and they know their rights, too; at least, when
they are at liberty, after the voyage is concluded:— the sailors also
salaamed, and withdrew, leaving Harry and me face to face with the
Paymaster-general of the Forces.

We stood awhile, looking as polite as possible, and expecting every
moment to hear our names called, but not a word did we hear; while the
captain, throwing aside his accounts, lighted a very fragrant cigar,
took up the morning paper—I think it was the Herald—threw his leg over
one arm of the chair, and plunged into the latest intelligence from all
parts of the world.

I looked at Harry, and he looked at me; and then we both looked at this
incomprehensible captain.

At last Harry hemmed, and I scraped my foot to increase the
disturbance.

The Paymaster-general looked up.

“Well, where do you come from? Who are _you,_ pray? and what do you
want? Steward, show these young gentlemen out.”

“I want my money,” said Harry.

“My wages are due,” said I.

The captain laughed. Oh! he was exceedingly merry; and taking a long
inspiration of smoke, removed his cigar, and sat sideways looking at
us, letting the vapor slowly wriggle and spiralize out of his mouth.

“Upon my soul, young gentlemen, you astonish me. Are your names down in
the City Directory? have you any letters of introduction, young
gentlemen?”

“Captain Riga!” cried Harry, enraged at his impudence—“I tell you what
it is, Captain Riga; this won’t do—where’s the rhino?”

“Captain Riga,” added I, “do you not remember, that about four months
ago, my friend Mr. Jones and myself had an interview with you in this
very cabin; when it was agreed that I was to go out in your ship, and
receive three dollars per month for my services? Well, Captain Riga, I
have gone out with you, and returned; and now, sir, I’ll thank you for
my pay.”

“Ah, yes, I remember,” said the captain. _“Mr. Jones!_ Ha! ha! I
remember Mr. Jones: a very gentlemanly gentleman; and stop—_you,_ too,
are the son of a wealthy French importer; and—let me think—was not your
great-uncle a barber?”

“No!” thundered I.

“Well, well, young gentleman, really I beg your pardon. Steward, chairs
for the young gentlemen—be seated, young gentlemen. And now, let me
see,” turning over his accounts— “Hum, hum!—yes, here it is:
Wellingborough Redburn, at three dollars a month. Say four months,
that’s twelve dollars; less three dollars advanced in Liverpool—that
makes it nine dollars; less three hammers and two scrapers lost
overboard— that brings it to four dollars and a quarter. I owe you four
dollars and a quarter, I believe, young gentleman?”

“So it seems, sir,” said I, with staring eyes.

“And now let me see what you owe me, and then well be able to square
the yards, Monsieur Redburn.”

Owe _him!_ thought I—what do I owe him but a grudge, but I concealed my
resentment; and presently he said, “By running away from the ship in
Liverpool, you forfeited your wages, which amount to twelve dollars;
and as there has been advanced to you, in money, hammers, and scrapers,
seven dollars and seventy-five cents, you are therefore indebted to me
in precisely that sum. Now, young gentleman, I’ll thank you for the
money;” and he extended his open palm across the desk.

“Shall I pitch into him?” whispered Harry.

I was thunderstruck at this most unforeseen announcement of the state
of my account with Captain Riga; and I began to understand why it was
that he had till now ignored my absence from the ship, when Harry and I
were in London. But a single minute’s consideration showed that I could
not help myself; so, telling him that he was at liberty to begin his
suit, for I was a bankrupt, and could not pay him, I turned to go.

Now, here was this man actually turning a poor lad adrift without a
copper, after he had been slaving aboard his ship for more than four
mortal months. But Captain Riga was a bachelor of expensive habits, and
had run up large wine bills at the City Hotel. He could not afford to
be munificent. Peace to his dinners.

“Mr. Bolton, I believe,” said the captain, now blandly bowing toward
Harry. “Mr. Bolton, _you_ also shipped for three dollars per month: and
you had one month’s advance in Liverpool; and from dock to dock we have
been about a month and a half; so I owe you just one dollar and a half,
Mr. Bolton; and here it is;” handing him six two-shilling pieces.

“And this,” said Harry, throwing himself into a tragical attitude,
_“this_ is the reward of my long and faithful services!”

Then, disdainfully flinging the silver on the desk, he exclaimed,
“There, Captain Riga, you may keep your tin! It has been in _your_
purse, and it would give me the itch to retain it. Good morning, sir.”

“Good morning, young gentlemen; pray, call again,” said the captain,
coolly bagging the coins. His politeness, while in port, was
invincible.

Quitting the cabin, I remonstrated with Harry upon his recklessness in
disdaining his wages, small though they were; I begged to remind him of
his situation; and hinted that every penny he could get might prove
precious to him. But he only cried _Pshaw!_ and that was the last of
it.

Going forward, we found the sailors congregated on the forecastle-deck,
engaged in some earnest discussion; while several carts on the wharf,
loaded with their chests, were just in the act of driving off, destined
for the boarding-houses uptown. By the looks of our shipmates, I saw
very plainly that they must have some mischief under weigh; and so it
turned out.

Now, though Captain Riga had not been guilty of any particular outrage
against the sailors; yet, by a thousand small meannesses—such as
indirectly causing their allowance of bread and beef to be diminished,
without betraying any appearance of having any inclination that way,
and without speaking to the sailors on the subject—by this, and kindred
actions, I say, he had contracted the cordial dislike of the whole
ship’s company; and long since they had bestowed upon him a name
unmentionably expressive of their contempt.

The voyage was now concluded; and it appeared that the subject being
debated by the assembly on the forecastle was, how best they might give
a united and valedictory expression of the sentiments they entertained
toward their late lord and master. Some emphatic symbol of those
sentiments was desired; some unmistakable token, which should forcibly
impress Captain Riga with the justest possible notion of their
feelings.

It was like a meeting of the members of some mercantile company, upon
the eve of a prosperous dissolution of the concern; when the
subordinates, actuated by the purest gratitude toward their president,
or chief, proceed to vote him a silver pitcher, in token of their
respect. It was something like this, I repeat—but with a material
difference, as will be seen.

At last, the precise manner in which the thing should be done being
agreed upon, Blunt, the “Irish cockney,” was deputed to summon the
captain. He knocked at the cabin-door, and politely requested the
steward to inform Captain Riga, that some gentlemen were on the
pier-head, earnestly seeking him; whereupon he joined his comrades.

In a few moments the captain sallied from the cabin, and found the
_gentlemen_ alluded to, strung along the top of the bulwarks, on the
side next to the wharf. Upon his appearance, the row suddenly wheeled
about, presenting their backs; and making a motion, which was a polite
salute to every thing before them, but an abominable insult to all who
happened to be in their rear, they gave three cheers, and at one bound,
cleared the ship.

True to his imperturbable politeness while in port, Captain Riga only
lifted his hat, smiled very blandly, and slowly returned into his
cabin.

Wishing to see the last movements of this remarkable crew, who were so
clever ashore and so craven afloat, Harry and I followed them along the
wharf, till they stopped at a sailor retreat, poetically denominated
“The Flashes.” And here they all came to anchor before the bar; and the
landlord, a lantern-jawed landlord, bestirred himself behind it, among
his villainous old bottles and decanters. He well knew, from their
looks, that his customers were “flush,” and would spend their money
freely, as, indeed, is the case with most seamen, recently paid off.

It was a touching scene.

“Well, maties,” said one of them, at last—“I spose we shan’t see each
other again:—come, let’s splice the main-brace all round, and drink to
_the last voyage!”_

Upon this, the landlord danced down his glasses, on the bar, uncorked
his decanters, and deferentially pushed them over toward the sailors,
as much as to say—_“Honorable gentlemen, it is not for me to allowance
your liquor;—help yourselves, your honors.”_

And so they did; each glass a bumper; and standing in a row, tossed
them all off; shook hands all round, three times three; and then
disappeared in couples, through the several doorways; for _“The
Flashes”_ was on a corner.

If to every one, life be made up of farewells and greetings, and a
_“Good-by, God bless you,”_ is heard for every _“How d’ye do, welcome,
my boy”—_then, of all men, sailors shake the most hands, and wave the
most hats. They are here and then they are there; ever shifting
themselves, they shift among the shifting: and like rootless sea-weed,
are tossed to and fro.

As, after shaking our hands, our shipmates departed, Harry and I stood
on the corner awhile, till we saw the last man disappear.

“They are gone,” said I.

“Thank heaven!” said Harry.




CHAPTER LXII.
THE LAST THAT WAS EVER HEARD OF HARRY BOLTON


That same afternoon, I took my comrade down to the Battery; and we sat
on one of the benches, under the summer shade of the trees.

It was a quiet, beautiful scene; full of promenading ladies and
gentlemen; and through the foliage, so fresh and bright, we looked out
over the bay, varied with glancing ships; and then, we looked down to
our boots; and thought what a fine world it would be, if we only had a
little money to enjoy it. But that’s the everlasting rub—oh, who can
cure an empty pocket?

“I have no doubt, Goodwell will take care of you, Harry,” said I, “he’s
a fine, good-hearted fellow; and will do his best for you, I know.”

“No doubt of it,” said Harry, looking hopeless.

“And I need not tell you, Harry, how sorry I am to leave you so soon.”

“And I am sorry enough myself,” said Harry, looking very sincere.

“But I will be soon back again, I doubt not,” said I.

“Perhaps so,” said Harry, shaking his head. “How far is it off?”

“Only a hundred and eighty miles,” said I.

“A hundred and eighty miles!” said Harry, drawing the words out like an
endless ribbon. “Why, I couldn’t walk that in a month.”

“Now, my dear friend,” said I, “take my advice, and while I am gone,
keep up a stout heart; never despair, and all will be well.”

But notwithstanding all I could say to encourage him, Harry felt so
bad, that nothing would do, but a rush to a neighboring bar, where we
both gulped down a glass of ginger-pop; after which we felt better.

He accompanied me to the steamboat, that was to carry me homeward; he
stuck close to my side, till she was about to put off; then, standing
on the wharf, he shook me by the hand, till we almost counteracted the
play of the paddles; and at last, with a mutual jerk at the arm-pits,
we parted. I never saw Harry again.

I pass over the reception I met with at home; how I plunged into
embraces, long and loving:—I pass over this; and will conclude _my
first voyage_ by relating all I know of what overtook Harry Bolton.

Circumstances beyond my control, detained me at home for several weeks;
during which, I wrote to my friend, without receiving an answer.

I then wrote to young Goodwell, who returned me the following letter,
now spread before me.

_“Dear Redburn—Your poor friend, Harry, I can not find any where. After
you left, he called upon me several times, and we walked out together;
and my interest in him increased every day. But you don’t know how dull
are the times here, and what multitudes of young men, well qualified,
are seeking employment in counting-houses. I did my best; but could not
get Harry a place. However, I cheered him. But he grew more and more
melancholy, and at last told me, that he had sold all his clothes but
those on his back to pay his board. I offered to loan him a few
dollars, but he would not receive them. I called upon him two or three
times after this, but he was not in; at last, his landlady told me that
he had permanently left her house the very day before. Upon my
questioning her closely, as to where he had gone, she answered, that
she did not know, but from certain hints that had dropped from our poor
friend, she feared he had gone on a whaling voyage. I at once went to
the offices in South-street, where men are shipped for the Nantucket
whalers, and made inquiries among them; but without success. And this,_
I _am heartily grieved to say, is all I know of our friend. I can not
believe that his melancholy could bring him to the insanity of throwing
himself away in a whaler; and I still think, that he must be somewhere
in the city. You must come down yourself, and help me seek him out.”_

This letter gave me a dreadful shock. Remembering our adventure in
London, and his conduct there; remembering how liable he was to yield
to the most sudden, crazy, and contrary impulses; and that, as a
friendless, penniless foreigner in New York, he must have had the most
terrible incitements to committing violence upon himself; I shuddered
to think, that even now, while I thought of him, he might no more be
living. So strong was this impression at the time, that I quickly
glanced over the papers to see if there were any accounts of suicides,
or drowned persons floating in the harbor of New York.

I now made all the haste I could to the seaport, but though I sought
him all over, no tidings whatever could be heard.

To relieve my anxiety, Goodwell endeavored to assure me, that Harry
must indeed have departed on a whaling voyage. But remembering his
bitter experience on board of the Highlander, and more than all, his
nervousness about going aloft, it seemed next to impossible.

At last I was forced to give him up.


Years after this, I found myself a sailor in the Pacific, on board of a
whaler. One day at sea, we spoke another whaler, and the boat’s crew
that boarded our vessel, came forward among us to have a little
sea-chat, as is always customary upon such occasions.

Among the strangers was an Englishman, who had shipped in his vessel at
Callao, for the cruise. In the course of conversation, he made allusion
to the fact, that he had now been in the Pacific several years, and
that the good craft Huntress of Nantucket had had the honor of
originally bringing him round upon that side of the globe. I asked him
why he had abandoned her; he answered that she was the most unlucky of
ships.

“We had hardly been out three months,” said he, “when on the Brazil
banks we lost a boat’s crew, chasing a whale after sundown; and next
day lost a poor little fellow, a countryman of mine, who had never
entered the boats; he fell over the side, and was jammed between the
ship, and a whale, while we were cutting the fish in. Poor fellow, he
had a hard time of it, from the beginning; he was a gentleman’s son,
and when you could coax him to it, he sang like a bird.”

“What was his name?” said I, trembling with expectation; “what kind of
eyes did he have? what was the color of his hair?”

“Harry Bolton was not your brother?” cried the stranger, starting.

_Harry Bolton!_ it was even he!

But yet, I, Wellingborough Redburn, chance to survive, after having
passed through far more perilous scenes than any narrated in this, _My
First Voyage_—which here I end.

starszym bratem na pastwę białych od żaru i oszołamiających dni letnich.

Wertowaliśmy, odurzeni światłem, w tej wielkiej księdze wakacji, której

wszystkie karty pałały od blasku i miały na dnie słodki do omdlenia

miąższ złotych gruszek. Adela wracała w świetliste poranki, jak Pomona z

ognia dnia rozżagwionego, wysypując z koszyka barwną urodę słońca -

lśniące, pełne wody pod przejrzystą skórką czereśnie, tajemnicze, czarne

wiśnie, których woń przekraczała to, co ziszczało się w smaku; morele, w

których miąższu złotym był rdzeń długich popołudni; a obok tej czystej

poezji owoców wyładowywała nabrzmiałe siłą i pożywnością płaty mięsa z

klawiaturą żeber cielęcych, wodorosty jarzyn, niby zabite głowonogi i

meduzy - surowy materiał obiadu o smaku jeszcze nie uformowanym i

jałowym, wegetatywne i telluryczne ingrediencje obiadu o zapachu dzikim

i polnym. Przez ciemne mieszkanie na pierwszym piętrze kamienicy w rynku

przechodziło co dzień na wskroś całe wielkie lato: cisza drgających

słojów powietrznych, kwadraty blasku śniące żarliwy swój sen na

podłodze; melodia katarynki, dobyta z najgłębszej złotej żyły dnia; dwa,

trzy takty refrenu, granego gdzie na fortepianie, wciąż na nowo,

mdlejące w słońcu na białych trotuarach, zagubione w ogniu dnia

głębokiego. Po sprzątaniu Adela zapuszczała cień na pokoje, zasuwając

płócienne story. Wtedy barwy schodziły o oktawę głębiej, pokój napełniał

się cieniem, jakby pogrążony w światło głębi morskiej, jeszcze mętniej

odbity w zielonych zwierciadłach, a cały upał dnia oddychał na storach,

lekko falujących od marzeń południowej godziny. W sobotnie popołudnia

wychodziłem z matką na spacer. Z półmroku sieni wstępowało się od razu w

słoneczną kąpiel dnia. Przechodnie, brodząc w złocie, mieli oczy

zmrużone od żaru, jakby zalepione miodem, a podciągnięta górna warga

odsłaniała im dziąsła i zęby. I wszyscy brodzący w tym dniu złocistym

mieli ów grymas skwaru, jak gdyby słońce nałożyło swym wyznawcom jedną i

tę samą maskę - złotą maskę bractwa słonecznego; i wszyscy, którzy szli

dziś ulicami, spotykali się, mijali, starcy i młodzi, dzieci i kobiety,

pozdrawiali się w przejściu tą maską, namalowaną grubą, złotą farbą na

twarzy, szczerzyli do siebie ten grymas bakchiczny - barbarzyńską maskę

kultu pogańskiego. Rynek był pusty i żółty od żaru, wymieciony z kurzu

gorącymi wiatrami, jak biblijna pustynia. Cierniste akacje, wyrosłe z

pustki żółtego placu, kipiały nad nim jasnym listowiem, bukietami

szlachetnie uczłonkowanych filigranów zielonych, jak drzewa na starych

gobelinach. Zdawało się, że te drzewa afektują wicher, wzburzając

teatralnie swe korony, ażeby w patetycznych przegięciach ukazać

wytworność wachlarzy listnych o srebrzystym podbrzuszu, jak futra

szlachetnych lisic. Stare domy, polerowane wiatrami wielu dni, zabawiały

się refleksami wielkiej atmosfery, echami, wspomnieniami barw,

rozproszonymi w głębi kolorowej pogody. Zdawało się, że całe generacje

dni letnich (jak cierpliwi sztukatorzy, obijający stare fasady z pleśni

tynku) obtłukiwały kłamliwą glazurę, wydobywając z dnia na dzień

wyraźniej prawdziwe oblicze domów, fizjonomię losu i życia, które

formowało je od wewnątrz. Teraz okna, oślepione blaskiem pustego placu,

spały; balkony wyznawały niebu swą pustkę; otwarte sienie pachniały

chłodem i winem. Kupka obdartusów, ocalała w kącie rynku przed płomienną

miotłą upału, oblegała kawałek muru, doświadczając go wciąż na nowo

rzutami guzików i monet, jak gdyby z horoskopu tych metalowych krążków

odczytać można było prawdziwą tajemnicę muru, porysowanego hieroglifami

rys i pęknięć. Zresztą rynek był pusty. Oczekiwało się, że przed tę sień

sklepioną z beczkami winiarza podjedzie w cieniu chwiejących się akacyj

osiołek Samarytanina, prowadzony za uzdę, a dwóch pachołków zwlecze

troskliwie chorego męża z rozpalonego siodła, ażeby go po chłodnych

schodach wnieść ostrożnie na pachnące szabasem piętro. Tak wędrowaliśmy

z matką przez dwie słoneczne strony rynku, wodząc nasze załamane cienie

po wszystkich domach, jak po klawiszach. Kwadraty bruku mijały powoli

pod naszymi miękkimi i płaskimi krokami - jedne bladoróżowe jak skóra

ludzka, inne złote i sine, wszystkie płaskie, ciepłe, aksamitne na

słońcu, jak jakie twarze słoneczne, zadeptane stopami aż do niepoznaki,

do błogiej nicości. Aż wreszcie na rogu ulicy Stryjskiej weszliśmy w

cień apteki. Wielka bania z sokiem malinowym w szerokim oknie aptecznym

symbolizowała chłód balsamów, którym każde cierpienie mogło się tam

ukoić. I po paru jeszcze domach ulica nie mogła już utrzymać nadal

decorum miasta, jak chłop, który wracając do wsi rodzimej, rozdziewa się

po drodze z miejskiej swej elegancji, zamieniając się powoli, w miarę

zbliżania do wsi, w obdartusa wiejskiego. Przedmiejskie domki tonęły

wraz z oknami, zapadnięte w bujnym i zagmatwanym kwitnieniu małych

ogródków. Zapomniane przez wielki dzień, pleniły się bujnie i cicho

wszelkie ziela, kwiaty i chwasty, rade z tej pauzy, którą prześnić mogły

za marginesem czasu, na rubieżach nieskończonego dnia. Ogromny

słonecznik, wydźwignięty na potężnej łodydze i chory na elephantiasis,

czekał w żółtej żałobie ostatnich, smutnych dni żywota, uginając się pod

przerostem potwornej korpulencji. Ale naiwne przedmiejskie dzwonki i

perkalikowe, niewybredne kwiatuszki stały bezradne w swych

nakrochmalonych, różowych i białych koszulkach, bez zrozumienia dla

wielkiej tragedii słonecznika.



                                          2



Splątany gąszcz traw, chwastów, zielska i bodiaków buzuje w ogniu

popołudnia. Huczy rojowiskiem much popołudniowa drzemka ogrodu. Złote

ciernisko krzyczy w słońcu, jak ruda szarańcza; w rzęsistym deszczu

ognia wrzeszczą świerszcze; strąki nasion eksplodują cicho, jak koniki

polne. A ku parkanowi kożuch traw podnosi się wypukłym garbem-pagórem,

jak gdyby ogród obrócił się we śnie na drugą stronę i grube jego,

chłopskie bary oddychają ciszą ziemi. Na tych barach ogrodu niechlujna,

babska bujność sierpnia wyolbrzymiała w głuche zapadliska ogromnych

łopuchów, rozpanoszyła się płatami włochatych blach listnych, wybujałymi

ozorami mięsistej zieleni. Tam te wyłupiaste pałuby łopuchów wybałuszyły

się jak babska szeroko rozsiadłe, na wpół pożarte przez własne oszalałe

spódnice. Tam sprzedawał ogród za darmo najtańsze krupy dzikiego bzu,

śmierdzącą mydłem, grubą kaszę babek, dziką okowitę mięty i wszelką

najgorszą tandetę sierpniową. Ale po drugiej stronie parkanu, za tym

matecznikiem lata, w którym rozrosła się głupota zidiociałych chwastów,

było śmietnisko zarosłe dziko bodiakiem. Nikt nie wiedział, że tam

właśnie odprawiał sierpień tego lata swoją wielką pogańską orgię. Na tym

śmietnisku, oparte o parkan i zarośnięte dzikim bzem, stało łóżko

skretyniałej dziewczyny Tłui. Tak nazywaliśmy ją wszyscy. Na kupie

śmieci i odpadków, starych garnków, pantofli, rumowiska i gruzu stało

zielono pomalowane łóżko, podparte zamiast brakującej nogi dwiema

starymi cegłami. Powietrze nad tym rumowiskiem, zdziczałe od żaru, cięte

błyskawicami lśniących much końskich, rozwścieczonych słońcem,

trzeszczało jak od nie widzianych grzechotek, podniecając do szału.

Tłuja siedzi przykucnięta wród żółtej pościeli i szmat. Wielka jej

głowa jeży się wiechciem czarnych włosów. Twarz jej jest kurczliwa jak

miech harmonii. Co chwila grymas płaczu składa tę harmonię w tysiąc

poprzecznych fałd, a zdziwienie rozciąga ją z powrotem, wygładza fałdy,

odsłania szparki drobnych oczu i wilgotne dziąsła z żółtymi zębami pod

ryjowatą, mięsistą wargą. Mijają godziny pełne żaru i nudy, podczas

których Tłuja gaworzy półgłosem, drzemie, zrzędzi z cicha i chrząka.

Muchy obsiadają nieruchomą gęstym rojem. Ale z nagła ta cała kupa

brudnych gałganów, szmat i strzępów zaczyna poruszać się, jakby ożywiona

chrobotem lęgnących się w niej szczurów. Muchy budzą się spłoszone i

podnoszą wielkim, huczącym rojem, pełnym wciekłego bzykania, błysków i

migotań. I podczas gdy gałgany zsypują się na ziemię i rozbiegają po

śmietnisku jak spłoszone szczury, wygrzebuje się z nich, odwija zwolna

jądro, wyłuszcza się rdzeń śmietniska: na wpół naga i ciemna kretynka

dźwiga się powoli i staje, podobna do bożka pogańskiego, na krótkich

dziecinnych nóżkach, a z napęczniałej napływem złości szyi, z

poczerwieniałej, ciemniejącej od gniewu twarzy, na której jak malowidła

barbarzyńskie wykwitają arabeski nabrzmiałych żył, wyrywa się wrzask

zwierzęcy, wrzask chrapliwy, dobyty ze wszystkich bronchij i piszczałek

tej półzwierzęcej-półboskiej piersi. Bodiaki, spalone słońcem, krzyczą,

łopuchy puchną i pysznią się bezwstydnym mięsem, chwasty ślinią się

błyszczącym jadem, a kretynka, ochrypła od krzyku, w konwulsji dzikiej

uderza mięsistym łonem z wściekłą zapalczywością w pień bzu dzikiego,

który skrzypi cicho pod natarczywością tej rozpustnej chuci, zaklinany

całym tym nędzarskim chórem do wynaturzonej, pogańskiej płodności. Matka

Tłui wynajmuje się gospodyniom do szorowania podłóg. Jest to mała, żółta

jak szafran kobieta i szafranem zaprawia też podłogi, jodłowe stoły,

ławy i szlabany, które w izbach ubogich ludzi zmywa. Raz zaprowadziła

mnie Adela do domu tej starej Maryki. Była wczesna poranna godzina,

weszliśmy do małej izby niebiesko bielonej, z ubitą polepą glinianą na

podłodze, na której leżało wczesne słońce, jaskrawożółte w tej ciszy

porannej, odmierzanej przeraźliwym szczękiem chłopskiego zegara na

ścianie. W skrzyni na słomie leżała głupia Maryka, blada jak opłatek i

cicha jak rękawiczka, z której wysunęła się dłoń. I jakby korzystając z

jej snu, gadała cisza, żółta, jaskrawa, zła cisza, monologowała, kłóciła

się, wygadywała głośno i ordynarnie swój maniacki monolog. Czas Maryki

- czas więziony w jej duszy, wystąpił z niej straszliwie rzeczywisty i

szedł samopas przez izbę, hałaśliwy, huczący, piekielny, rosnący w

jaskrawym milczeniu poranka z głośnego młyna-zegara, jak zła mąka, sypka

mąka, głupia mąka wariatów.



                                                3



 W jednym z tych domków, otoczonym sztachetami brązowej barwy, tonącym

w bujnej zieleni ogródka, mieszkała ciotka Agata. Wchodząc do niej,

mijaliśmy w ogrodzie kolorowe szklane kule, tkwiące na tyczkach, różowe,

zielone i fioletowe, w których zaklęte były całe świetlane i jasne

światy, jak te idealne i szczęśliwe obrazy zamknięte w niedościgłej

doskonałości baniek mydlanych. W półciemnej sieni ze starymi

oleodrukami, pożartymi przez pleśń i oślepłymi od starości,

odnajdowaliśmy znany nam zapach. W tej zaufanej starej woni mieściło się

w dziwnie prostej syntezie życie tych ludzi, alembik rasy, gatunek krwi

i sekret ich losu, zawarty niedostrzegalnie w codziennym mijaniu ich

własnego, odrębnego czasu. Stare, mądre drzwi, których ciemne

westchnienia wpuszczały i wypuszczały tych ludzi, milczący świadkowie

wchodzenia i wychodzenia matki, córek i synów-otworzyły się bezgłośnie

jak odrzwia szafy i weszliśmy w ich życie. Siedzieli jakby w cieniu

swego losu i nie bronili się - w pierwszych niezręcznych gestach

wydali nam swoją tajemnicę. Czyż nie byliśmy krwią i losem spokrewnieni z

nimi? Pokój był ciemny i aksamitny od granatowych obić ze złotym

deseniem, lecz echo dnia płomiennego drgało i tutaj jeszcze mosiądzem na

ramach obrazów, na klamkach i listwach złotych, choć przepuszczone przez

gęstą zieleń ogrodu. Spod ściany podniosła się ciotka Agata, wielka i

bujna, o mięsie okrągłym i białym, centkowanym rudą rdzą piegów.

Przysiedliśmy się do nich, jakby na brzeg ich losu, zawstydzeni trochę

tą bezbronnością, z jaką wydali się nam bez zastrzeżeń, i piliśmy wodę z

sokiem różanym, napój przedziwny, w którym znalazłem jakby najgłębszą

esencję tej upalnej soboty. Ciotka narzekała. Był to zasadniczy ton jej

rozmów, głos tego mięsa białego i płodnego, bujającego już jakby poza

granicami osoby, zaledwie luźnie utrzymywanej w skupieniu, w więzach

formy indywidualnej, i nawet w tym skupieniu już zwielokrotnionej,

gotowej rozpaść się, rozgałęzić, rozsypać w rodzinę. Była to płodność

niemal samoródcza, kobiecość pozbawiona hamulców i chorobliwie wybujała.

Zdawało się, że sam aromat męskości, zapach dymu tytoniowego, dowcip

kawalerski mógł dać impuls tej zaognionej kobiecości do rozpustnego

dzieworództwa. I właściwie wszystkie jej skargi na męża, na służbę, jej

troski o dzieci były tylko kapryszeniem i dąsaniem się nie zaspokojonej

płodności, dalszym ciągiem tej opryskliwej, gniewnej i płaczliwej

kokieterii, którą nadaremnie doświadczała męża. Wuj Marek, mały,

zgarbiony, o twarzy wyjałowionej z płci, siedział w swym szarym

bankructwie, pogodzony z losem, w cieniu bezgranicznej pogardy, w którym

zdawał się wypoczywać. W jego szarych oczach tlił się daleki żar ogrodu,

rozpięty w oknie. Czasem próbował słabym ruchem robić jakie

zastrzeżenia, stawiać opór, ale fala samowystarczalnej kobiecości

odrzucała na bok ten gest bez znaczenia, przechodziła triumfalnie mimo

niego, zalewała szerokim swym strumieniem słabe podrygi męskości. Było

coś tragicznego w tej płodności niechlujnej i nieumiarkowanej, była

nędza kreatury walczącej na granicy nicości i śmierci, był jakiś heroizm

kobiecości triumfującej urodzajnością nawet nad kalectwem natury, nad

insuficjencją mężczyzny. Ale potomstwo ukazywało rację tej paniki

macierzyńskiej, tego szału rodzenia, który wyczerpywał się w płodach

nieudanych, w efemerycznej generacji fantomów bez krwi i twarzy. Weszła

Łucja, średnia, z głową nazbyt rozkwitłą i dojrzałą na dziecięcym i

pulchnym ciele o mięsie białym i delikatnym. Podała mi rączkę lalkowatą,

jakby dopiero pączkującą, i zakwitła od razu całą twarzą, jak piwonia

przelewająca się pełnią różową. Nieszczęśliwa z powodu swych rumieńców,

które bezwstydnie mówiły o sekretach menstruacji, przymykała oczy i

płoniła się jeszcze bardziej pod dotknięciem najobojętniejszego pytania,

gdyż każde zawierało tajną aluzję do jej nadwrażliwego panieństwa. Emil,

najstarszy z kuzynów, z jasnoblond wąsem, z twarzą, z której życie zmyło

jakby wszelki wyraz, spacerował tam i z powrotem po pokoju, z rękami w

kieszeniach fałdzistych spodni. Jego strój elegancki i drogocenny nosił

piętno egzotycznych krajów, z których powrócił. Jego twarz, zwiędła i

zmętniała, zdawała się z dnia na dzień zapominać o sobie, stawać się

białą pustą ścianą z bladą siecią żyłek, w których jak linie na zatartej

mapie plątały się gasnące wspomnienia tego burzliwego i zmarnowanego

życia. Był mistrzem sztuk karcianych, palił długie, szlachetne fajki i

pachniał dziwnie zapachem dalekich krajów. Z wzrokiem wędrującym po

dawnych wspomnieniach opowiadał dziwne anegdoty, które w pewnym punkcie

urywały się nagle, rozprzęgały i rozwiewały w nicość. Wodziłem za nim

tęsknym wzrokiem, pragnąc, by zwrócił na mnie uwagę i wybawił mnie z

udręki nudów. I w samej rzeczy zdawało mi się, że mrugnął na mnie

oczyma, wychodząc do drugiego pokoju. Podążyłem za nim. Siedział nisko

na małej kozetce, z kolanami krzyżującymi się niemal na wysokości głowy,

łysej jak kula bilardowa. Zdawało się, że to ubranie samo leży,

fałdziste, zmięte, przerzucone przez fotel. Twarz jego była jak

tchnienie twarzy - smuga, którą nieznany przechodzień zostawił w

powietrzu. Trzymał w bladych, emaliowanych błękitnie dłoniach portfel, w

którym coś oglądał. Z mgły twarzy wyłoniło się z trudem wypukłe bielmo

bladego oka, wabiąc mnie figlarnym mruganiem. Czułem doń nieprzepartą

sympatię. Wziął mnie między kolana i tasując przed mymi oczyma wprawnymi

dłońmi fotografie, pokazywał wizerunki nagich kobiet i chłopców w

dziwnych pozycjach. Stałem oparty o niego bokiem i patrzyłem na te

delikatne ciała ludzkie dalekimi, niewidzącymi oczyma, gdy fluid

niejasnego wzburzenia, którym nagle zmętniało powietrze, doszedł do mnie

i zbiegł mię dreszczem niepokoju, falą nagłego zrozumienia. Ale

tymczasem ta mgiełka umiechu, która się zarysowała pod miękkim i

pięknym jego wąsem, zawiązek pożądania, który napiął się na jego

skroniach pulsującą żyłą, natężenie trzymające przez chwilę jego rysy w

skupieniu - upadły z powrotem w nicość i twarz odeszła w nieobecnoć,

zapomniała o sobie, rozwiała się,





                               NAWIEDZENIE



                                       1



Już wówczas miasto nasze popadało coraz bardziej w

chroniczną szarość zmierzchu, porastało na krawędziach liszajem cienia,

puszystą pleśnią i mchem koloru żelaza. Ledwo rozpowity z brunatnych

dymów i mgieł poranka - przechylał się dzień od razu w niskie

bursztynowe popołudnie, stawał się przez chwilę przezroczysty i złoty

jak ciemne piwo, ażeby potem zejść pod wielokrotnie rozczłonkowane,

fantastyczne sklepienia kolorowych i rozległych nocy. Mieszkaliśmy w

rynku, w jednym z tych ciemnych domów o pustych i ślepych fasadach,

które tak trudno od siebie odróżnić. Daje to powód do ciągłych omyłek.

Gdyż wszedłszy raz w niewłaściwą sień na niewłaściwe schody, dostawało

się zazwyczaj w prawdziwy labirynt obcych mieszkań, ganków,

niespodzianych wyjść na obce podwórza i zapominało się o początkowym

celu wyprawy, ażeby po wielu dniach, wracając z manowców dziwnych i

splątanych przygód, o jakimś szarym świcie przypomnieć sobie wśród

wyrzutów sumienia dom rodzinny. Pełne wielkich szaf, głębokich kanap,

bladych luster i tandetnych palm sztucznych mieszkanie nasze coraz

bardziej popadało w stan zaniedbania wskutek opieszałości matki,

przesiadującej w sklepie, i niedbalstwa smukłonogiej Adeli, która nie

nadzorowana przez nikogo, spędzała dnie przed lustrami na rozwlekłej

toalecie, zostawiając wszędzie ślady w postaci wyczesanych włosów,

grzebieni, porzuconych pantofelków i gorsetów. Mieszkanie to nie

posiadało określonej liczby pokojów, gdyż nie pamiętano, ile z nich

wynajęte było obcym lokatorom. Nieraz otwierano przypadkiem którąś z

tych izb zapomnianych i znajdowano ją pustą; lokator dawno się

wyprowadził, a w nietkniętych od miesięcy szufladach dokonywano

niespodzianych odkryć. W dolnych pokojach mieszkali subiekci i nieraz w

nocy budziły nas ich jęki, wydawane pod wpływem zmory sennej. W zimie

była jeszcze na dworze głucha noc, gdy ojciec schodził do tych zimnych i

ciemnych pokojów, płosząc przed sobą świecą stada cieni, ulatujących

bokami po podłodze i ścianach; szedł budzić ciężko chrapiących z

twardego jak kamień snu. W świetle pozostawionej przezeń świecy wywijali

się leniwie z brudnej pościeli, wystawiali, siadając na łóżkach, bose i

brzydkie nogi i z skarpetką w ręce oddawali się jeszcze przez chwilę

rozkoszy ziewania - ziewania przeciągniętego aż do lubieżności, do

bolesnego skurczu podniebienia, jak przy tęgich wymiotach. W kątach

siedziały nieruchomo wielkie karakony, wyogromnione własnym cieniem,

którym obarczała każdego płonąca świeca i który nie odłączał się od nich

i wówczas, gdy który z tych płaskich, bezgłowych kadłubów z nagła

zaczynał biec niesamowitym, pajęczym biegiem. W tym czasie ojciec mój

zaczął zapadać na zdrowiu. Bywało już w pierwszych tygodniach tej

wczesnej zimy, że spędzał dnie całe w łóżku, otoczony flaszkami,

pigułkami i księgami handlowymi, które mu przynoszono z kontuaru. Gorzki

zapach choroby osiadał na dnie pokoju, którego tapety gęstwiały

ciemniejszym splotem arabesek. Wieczorami, gdy matka przychodziła ze

sklepu, bywał podniecony i skłonny do sprzeczek, zarzucał jej

niedokładności w prowadzeniu rachunków, dostawał wypieków i zapalał się

do niepoczytalności. Pamiętam, iż raz, obudziwszy się ze snu późno w

nocy, ujrzałem go, jak w koszuli i boso biegał tam i z powrotem po

skórzanej kanapie, dokumentując w ten sposób swą irytację przed bezradną

matką. W inne dni bywał spokojny i skupiony i pogrążał się zupełnie w

swych księgach, zabłąkany głęboko w labiryntach zawiłych obliczeń. Widzę

go w świetle kopcącej lampy, przykucniętego wśród poduszek, pod wielkim

rzeźbionym nadgłowiem łóżka, z ogromnym cieniem od głowy na ścianie,

kiwającego się w bezgłośnej medytacji. Chwilami wynurzał głowę z tych

rachunków, jakby dla zaczerpnięcia tchu, otwierał usta, mlaskał z

niesmakiem językiem, który był suchy i gorzki, i rozglądał się

bezradnie, jakby czegoś szukając. Wówczas bywało, że zbiegał po cichu z

łóżka w kąt pokoju, pod ścianę, na której wisiał zaufany instrument. Był

to rodzaj klepsydry wodnej albo wielkiej fioli szklanej, podzielonej na

uncje i napełnionej ciemnym fluidem. Mój ojciec łączył się z tym

instrumentem długą kiszką gumową, jakby krętą, bolesną pępowiną, i tak

połączony z żałosnym przyrządem - nieruchomiał w skupieniu, a oczy jego

ciemniały, zaś na twarz przybladłą występował wyraz cierpienia czy

jakiej występnej rozkoszy. Potem znów przychodziły dni cichej skupionej

pracy, przeplatanej samotnymi monologami. Gdy tak siedział w świetle

lampy stołowej, wśród poduszek wielkiego łoża, a pokój ogromniał górą w

cieniu umbry, który go łączył z wielkim żywiołem nocy miejskiej za oknem

- czuł, nie patrząc, że przestrzeń obrasta go pulsującą gęstwiną tapet,

pełną szeptów, syków i seplenień. Słyszał, nie patrząc, tę zmowę pełną

porozumiewawczych mrugnięć perskich oczu, rozwijających się wśród

kwiatów małżowin usznych, które słuchały, i ciemnych ust, które się

uśmiechały. Wówczas pogrążał się pozornie jeszcze bardziej w pracę,

liczył i sumował, bojąc się zdradzić ten gniew, który w nim wzbierał, i

walcząc z pokusą, żeby z nagłym krzykiem nie rzucić się na oślep za

siebie i nie pochwycić pełnych garści tych kędzierzawych arabesek, tych

pęków oczu i uszu, które noc wyroiła ze siebie i które rosły i

zwielokrotniały się, wymajaczając coraz nowe pędy i odnogi z

macierzystego pępka ciemności. I uspokajał się dopiero, gdy z odpływem

nocy tapety więdły, zwijały się, gubiły liście i kwiaty i przerzedzały

się jesiennie, przepuszczając dalekie świtanie. Wtedy wśród świergotu

tapetowych ptaków, w żółtym zimowym świcie zasypiał na parę godzin

gęstym, czarnym snem. Od dni, od tygodni, gdy zdawał się być pogrążonym

w zawiłych konto-korrentach - myśl jego zapuszczała się tajnie w

labirynty własnych wnętrzności. Wstrzymywał oddech i nasłuchiwał. I gdy

wzrok jego wracał zbielały i mętny z tamtych głębin, uspokajał go

uśmiechem. Nie wierzył jeszcze i odrzucał jak absurd te uroszczenia, te

propozycje, które nań napierały. Za dnia były to jakby rozumowania i

perswazje, długie, monotonne rozważania prowadzone półgłosem i pełne

humorystycznych interludiów, filuternych przekomarzań. Ale nocą

podnosiły się te głosy namiętniej. Żądanie wracało coraz wyraźniej i

donioślej i słyszeliśmy, jak rozmawiał z Bogiem, prosząc się jak gdyby i

wzbraniając przed czym, co natarczywie żądało i domagało się. Aż pewnej

nocy podniósł się ten głos groźnie i nieodparcie, żądając, aby mu dał

świadectwo usty i wnętrznościami swymi. I usłyszeliśmy, jak duch weń

wstąpił, jak podnosi się z łóżka, długi i rosnący gniewem proroczym,

dławiąc się hałaśliwymi słowy, które wyrzucał jak mitralieza.

Słyszeliśmy łomot walki i jęk ojca, jęk tytana ze złamanym biodrem,

który jeszcze urąga. Nie widziałem nigdy proroków Starego Testamentu,

ale na widok tego męża, którego gniew boży obalił, rozkraczonego szeroko

na ogromnym porcelanowym urynale, zakrytego wichrem ramion, chmurą

rozpaczliwych łamańców, nad którymi wyżej jeszcze unosił się głos jego,

obcy i twardy - zrozumiałem gniew boży świętych mężów. Był to dialog

groźny jak mowa piorunów. Łamańce rąk jego rozrywały niebo na sztuki, a

w szczelinach ukazywała się twarz Jehowy, wzdęta gniewem i plująca

przekleństwa. Nie patrząc widziałem go, groźnego Demiurga, jak leżąc na

ciemnościach jak na Synaju, wsparłszy potężne dłonie na karniszu

firanek, przykładał ogromną twarz do górnych szyb okna, na których

płaszczył się potwornie mięsisty nos jego. Słyszałem jego głos w

przerwach proroczej tyrady mego ojca, słyszałem te potężne warknięcia

wzdętych warg, od których szyby brzęczały, mieszające się z wybuchami

zaklęć, lamentów, gróźb mego ojca. Czasami głosy przycichały i zżymały

się z cicha jak gaworzenie wiatru w nocnym kominie, to znowu wybuchały

wielkim zgiełkliwym hałasem, burzą zmieszanych szlochów i przekleństw. Z

nagła otworzyło się okno ciemnym ziewnięciem i płachta ciemności wionęła

przez pokój. W świetle błyskawicy ujrzałem ojca mego w rozwianej

bieliźnie, jak ze straszliwym przekleństwem wylewał potężnym chlustem w

okno zawartość nocnika w noc szumiącą jak muszla.



                                                2



  Mój ojciec powoli zanikał, wiądł w oczach. Przykucnięty pod wielkimi poduszkami, dziko

nastroszony kępami siwych włosów, rozmawiał z sobą półgłosem, pogrążony

cały w jakieś zawiłe wewnętrzne afery. Zdawać się mogło, że osobowość

jego rozpadła się na wiele pokłóconych i rozbieżnych jaźni, gdyż kłócił

się ze sobą głośno, pertraktował usilnie i namiętnie, przekonywał i

prosił, to znowu zdawał się przewodniczyć zgromadzeniu wielu

interesantów, których usiłował z całym nakładem żarliwości i swady

pogodzić. Ale za każdym razem te hałaśliwe zebrania, pełne gorących

temperamentów, rozpryskiwały się przy końcu, wśród klątw, złorzeczeń i

obelg. Potem przyszedł okres jakiego uciszenia, ukojenia wewnętrznego,

błogiej pogody ducha. Znowu wielkie folianty rozłożone były na łóżku, na

stole, na podłodze i jakiś benedyktyński spokój pracy zalegał w świetle

lampy nad białą pościelą łóżka, nad pochyloną siwą głową mego ojca. Ale

gdy matka późnym wieczorem wracała ze sklepu, ojciec ożywiał się,

przywoływał ją do siebie i z dumą pokazywał jej świetne, kolorowe

odbijanki, którymi skrzętnie wylepił stronice księgi głównej.

Zauważylimy wówczas wszyscy, że ojciec zaczął z dnia na dzień maleć jak

orzech, który zsycha się wewnątrz łupiny. Zanikowi temu nie towarzyszył

bynajmniej upadek sił. Przeciwnie, stan jego zdrowia, humor, ruchliwość

zdawały się poprawiać. Często śmiał się teraz głośno i szczebiotliwie,

zanosił się wprost od śmiechu, albo też pukał w łóżko i odpowiadał sobie

proszę w różnych tonacjach, całymi godzinami. Od czasu do czasu złaził

z łóżka, wspinał się na szafę i przykucnięty pod sufitem porządkował coś

w starych gratach, pełnych rdzy i kurzu. Niekiedy ustawiał sobie dwa

krzesła naprzeciw siebie i wspierając się rękami o poręcze, bujał się

nogami wstecz i naprzód, szukając rozpromienionymi oczyma w naszych

twarzach wyrazów podziwu i zachęty. Z Bogiem, zdaje się, pogodził się

zupełnie. Niekiedy w nocy ukazywała się twarz brodatego Demiurga w oknie

sypialni, oblana ciemną purpurą bengalskiego światła, i patrzyła przez

chwilę dobrotliwie na uśpionego głęboko, którego śpiewne chrapanie

zdawało się wędrować daleko po nieznanych obszarach światów sennych.

Podczas długich, półciemnych popołudni tej późnej zimy ojciec mój

zapadał od czasu do czasu na całe godziny w gęsto zastawione gratami

zakamarki, szukając czegoś zawzięcie. I nieraz bywało podczas obiadu,

gdy zasiadaliśmy wszyscy do stołu, brakło ojca. Wówczas matka musiała

długo wołać Jakubie! i stukać łyżką w stół, zanim wylazł z jakiejś

szafy, oblepiony szmatami pajęczyny i kurzu, z wzrokiem nieprzytomnym i

pogrążonym w zawiłych, a jemu tylko wiadomych sprawach, które go

zaprzątały. Czasem wdrapywał się na karnisz i przybierał nieruchomą pozę

symetrycznie do wielkiego wypchanego sępa, który po drugiej stronie okna

zawieszony był na ścianie. W tej nieruchomej, przykucniętej pozie, z

wzrokiem zamglonym i z miną chytrze umiechniętą trwał godzinami, ażeby

z nagła przy czyim wejściu zatrzepotać rękoma jak skrzydłami i zapiać

jak kogut. Przestalimy zwracać uwagę na te dziwactwa, w które się z

dnia na dzień głębiej wplątywał. Wyzbyty jakby zupełnie cielesnych

potrzeb, nie przyjmując tygodniami pokarmu, pogrążał się z dniem każdym

głębiej w zawiłe i dziwaczne afery, dla których nie mieliśmy

zrozumienia. Niedosięgły dla naszych perswazji i próźb, odpowiadał

urywkami swego wewnętrznego monologu, którego przebiegu nic z zewnątrz

zmącić nie mogło. Wiecznie zaaferowany, chorobliwie ożywiony, z

wypiekami na suchych policzkach nie zauważał nas i przeoczał.

Przywykliśmy do jego nieszkodliwej obecności, do jego cichego

gaworzenia, do tego dziecinnego, w sobie zatopionego świegotu, którego

trele przebiegały niejako na marginesie naszego czasu. Wtedy już znikał

niekiedy na wiele dni, podziewał się gdzieś w zapadłych zakamarkach

mieszkania i nie można go było znaleźć. Stopniowo te zniknięcia

przestały sprawiać na nas wrażenie, przywykliśmy do nich i kiedy po

wielu dniach znów się pojawiał, o parę cali mniejszy i chudszy, nie

zatrzymywało to na dłużej naszej uwagi. Przestaliśmy po prostu brać go w

rachubę, tak bardzo oddalił się od wszystkiego, co ludzkie i co

rzeczywiste. Węzeł po węźle odluźniał się od nas, punkt po punkcie gubił

związki łączące go ze wspólnotą ludzką. To, co jeszcze z niego

pozostało, to trochę cielesnej powłoki i ta garść bezsensownych dziwactw

- mogły zniknąć pewnego dnia, tak samo nie zauważone jak szara kupka

śmieci, gromadząca się w kącie, którą Adela co dzień wynosiła na

śmietnik.



                                     PTAKI



Nadeszły żółte, pełne nudy dni zimowe. Zrudziałą ziemię pokrywał

dziurawy, przetarty, za krótki obrus śniegu. Na wiele dachów nie

starczyło go i stały czarne lub rdzawe, gontowe strzechy i arki kryjące

w sobie zakopcone przestrzenie strychów - czarne, zwęglone katedry,

najeżone żebrami krokwi, płatwi i bantów - ciemne płuca wichrów

zimowych. Każdy świt odkrywał nowe kominy i dymniki, wyrosłe w nocy,

wydęte przez wicher nocny, czarne piszczałki organów diabelskich.

Kominiarze nie mogli opędzić się od wron, które na kształt żywych

czarnych liści obsiadały wieczorem gałęzie drzew pod kościołem, odrywały

się znów, trzepocąc, by wreszcie przylgnąć, każda do właściwego miejsca

na właściwej gałęzi, a o świcie ulatywały wielkimi stadami - tumany

sadzy, płatki kopciu, falujące i fantastyczne, plamiąc migotliwym

krakaniem mętnożółte smugi świtu. Dni stwardniały od zimna i nudy, jak

zeszłoroczne bochenki chleba. Napoczynano je tępymi nożami, bez apetytu,

z leniwą sennością. Ojciec nie wychodził już z domu. Palił w piecach,

studiował nigdy niezgłębioną istotę ognia, wyczuwał słony, metaliczny

posmak i wędzony zapach zimowych płomieni, chłodną pieszczotę

salamander, liżących błyszczącą sadzę w gardzieli komina. Z zamiłowaniem

wykonywał w owych dniach wszystkie reparatury w górnych regionach

pokoju. O każdej porze dnia można go było widzieć, jak - przykucnięty na

szczycie drabiny - majstrował coś przy suficie, przy kamiszach wysokich

okien, przy kulach i łańcuchach lamp wiszących. Zwyczajem malarzy

posługiwał się drabiną jak ogromnymi szczudłami i czuł się dobrze w tej

ptasiej perspektywie, w pobliżu malowanego nieba, arabesek i ptaków

sufitu. Od spraw praktycznego życia oddalał się coraz bardziej. Gdy

matka, pełna troski i zmartwienia z powodu jego stanu, starała się go

wciągnąć w rozmowę o interesach, o płatnościach najbliższego ultimo,

słuchał jej z roztargnieniem, pełen niepokoju, z drgawkami w nieobecnej

twarzy. I bywało, że przerywał jej nagle zaklinającym gestem ręki, ażeby

pobiec w kąt pokoju, przylgnąć uchem do szpary w podłodze i z

podniesionymi palcami wskazującymi obu rąk, wyrażającymi najwyższą

ważność badania - nasłuchiwać. Nie rozumieliśmy wówczas jeszcze smutnego

tła tych ekstrawagancji, opłakanego kompleksu, który dojrzewał w głębi.

Matka nie miała nań żadnego wpływu, natomiast wielką czcią i uwagą

darzył Adelę. Sprzątanie pokoju było dlań wielką i ważną ceremonią,

której nie zaniedbywał nigdy być świadkiem, śledząc z mieszaniną strachu

i rozkosznego dreszczu wszystkie manipulacje Adeli. Wszystkim jej

czynnościom przypisywał głębsze, symboliczne znaczenie. Gdy dziewczyna

młodymi i śmiałymi ruchami posuwała szczotkę na długim drążku po

podłodze, było to niemal ponad jego siły. Z oczu jego lały się wówczas

łzy, twarz zanosiła się od cichego śmiechu, a ciałem wstrząsał rozkoszny

spazm orgazmu. Jego wrażliwość na łaskotki dochodziła do szaleństwa.

Wystarczyło, by Adela skierowała doń palec ruchem oznaczającym

łaskotanie, a już w dzikim popłochu uciekał przez wszystkie pokoje,

zatrzaskując za sobą drzwi, by wreszcie w ostatnim paść brzuchem na

łóżko i wić się w konwulsjach śmiechu pod wpływem samego obrazu

wewnętrznego, któremu nie mógł się oprzeć. Dzięki temu miała Adela nad

ojcem władzę niemal nieograniczoną. W tym to czasie zauważyliśmy u ojca

po raz pierwszy namiętne zainteresowanie dla zwierząt. Była to

początkowo namiętność myśliwego i artysty zarazem, była może także

głębsza, zoologiczna sympatia kreatury dla pokrewnych, a tak odmiennych

form życia, eksperymentowanie w nie wypróbowanych rejestrach bytu.

Dopiero w późniejszej fazie wzięła sprawa ten niesamowity, zaplątany,

głęboko grzeszny i przeciwny naturze obrót, którego lepiej nie wywlekać

na światło dzienne. Zaczęło się to od wylęgania jaj ptasich. Z wielkim

nakładem trudu i pieniędzy sprowadzał ojciec z Hamburga, z Holandii, z

afrykańskich stacji zoologicznych zapłodnione jaja ptasie, które dawał

do wylęgania ogromnym kurom belgijskim. Był to proceder nader zajmujący

i dla mnie - to wykluwanie się piskląt, prawdziwych dziwotworów w

kształcie i ubarwieniu. Nie podobna było dopatrzyć się w tych monstrach

o ogromnych, fantastycznych dziobach, które natychmiast po urodzeniu

rozdzierały się szeroko, sycząc żarłocznie czeluściami gardła, w tych

jaszczurach o wątłym, nagim ciele garbusów - przyszłych pawi, bażantów,

głuszców i kondorów. Umieszczony w koszykach, w wacie, smoczy ten pomiot

podnosił na cienkich szyjach ślepe, bielmem zarosle głowy, kwacząc

bezgłośnie z niemych gardzieli. Mój ojciec chodził wzdłuż półek w

zielonym fartuchu, jak ogrodnik wzdłuż inspektów z kaktusami, i wywabiał

z nicości te pęcherze ślepe, pulsujące życiem, te niedołężne brzuchy,

przyjmujące świat zewnętrzny tylko w formie jedzenia, te narośle życia,

pnące się omackiem ku światłu. W parę tygodni później, gdy te ślepe

pączki życia pękły do światła, napełniły się pokoje kolorowym pogwarem,

migotliwym świergotem swych nowych mieszkańców. Obsiadały one karnisze

firanek, gzymsy szaf, gnieździły się w gęstwinie cynowych gałęzi i

arabesek wieloramiennych lamp wiszących. Gdy ojciec studiował wielkie

ornitologiczne kompendia i wertował kolorowe tablice, zdawały się

ulatywać z nich te pierzaste fantazmaty i napełniać pokój kolorowym

trzepotem, płatami purpury, strzępami szafiru, grynszpanu i srebra.

Podczas karmienia tworzyły one na podłodze barwną, falującą grządkę,

dywan żywy, który za czyimś niebacznym wejściem rozpadał się, rozlatywał

w ruchome kwiaty, trzepocące w powietrzu, aby w końcu rozmieścić się w

górnych regionach pokoju. W pamięci pozostał mi szczególnie jeden

kondor, ogromny ptak o szyi nagiej, twarzy pomarszczonej i wybujałej

naroślami. Był to chudy asceta, lama buddyjski, pełen niewzruszonej

godności w całym zachowaniu, kierujący się żelaznym ceremoniałem swego

wielkiego rodu. Gdy siedział naprzeciw ojca, nieruchomy w swej

monumentalnej pozycji odwiecznych bóstw egipskich, z okiem zawleczonym

białawym bielmem, które zasuwał z boku na źrenice, ażeby zamknąć się

zupełnie w kontemplacji swej dostojnej samotności - wydawał się ze swym

kamiennym profilem starszym bratem mego ojca. Ta sama materia ciała,

ścięgien i pomarszczonej twardej skóry, ta sama twarz wyschła i

koścista, te same zrogowaciałe, głębokie oczodoły. Nawet ręce, silne w

węzłach, długie, chude dłonie ojca, z wypukłymi paznokciami, miały swój

analogon w szponach kondora. Nie mogłem się oprzeć wrażeniu, widząc go

tak uśpionego, że mam przed sobą mumię - wyschłą i dlatego pomniejszoną

mumię mego ojca. Sądzę, że i uwagi matki nie uszło to przedziwne

podobieństwo, chociaż nigdy nie poruszaliśmy tego tematu.

Charakterystyczne jest, że kondor używał wspólnego z moim ojcem naczynia

nocnego. Nie poprzestając na wylęganiu coraz nowych egzemplarzy, ojciec

mój urządzał na strychu wesela ptasie, wysyłał swatów, uwiązywał w

lukach i dziurach strychu ponętne, stęsknione narzeczone i osiągnął w

samej rzeczy to, że dach naszego domu, ogromny, dwuspadowy dach gontowy,

stał się prawdziwą gospodą ptasią, arką Noego, do której zlatywały się

wszelkiego rodzaju skrzydlacze z dalekich stron. Nawet długo po

zlikwidowaniu ptasiego gospodarstwa utrzymywała się w świecie ptasim ta

tradycja naszego domu i w okresie wiosennych wędrówek spadały nieraz na

nasz dach całe chmary żurawi, pelikanów, pawi i wszelkiego ptactwa.

Impreza ta wzięła jednak niebawem - po krótkiej świetności - smutny

obrót. Wkrótce okazała się bowiem konieczna translokacja ojca do dwóch

pokojów na poddaszu, które służyły za rupieciarnie. Stamtąd dochodził

już o wczesnym świcie zmieszany klangor głosów ptasich. Drewniane pudła

pokojów na strychu, wspomagane rezonansem przestrzeni dachowej,

dźwięczały całe od szumu, trzepotu, piania, tokowania i gulgotu. Tak

straciliśmy ojca z widoku na przeciąg kilku tygodni. Rzadko tylko

schodził do mieszkania i wtedy mogliśmy zauważyć, że zmniejszył się

jakoby, schudł i skurczył. Niekiedy przez zapomnienie zrywał się z

krzesła przy stole i trzepiąc rękoma jak skrzydłami, wydawał pianie

przeciągłe, a oczy zachodziły mu mgłą bielma. Potem, zawstydzony, śmiał

się razem z nami i starał się ten incydent obrócić w żart. Pewnego razu

w okresie generalnych porządków zjawiła się niespodzianie Adela w

państwie ptasim ojca. Stanąwszy we drzwiach, załamała ręce nad fetorem,

który się unosił w powietrzu, oraz nad kupami kału, zalegającego

podłogi, stoły i meble. Szybko zdecydowana otworzyła okno, po czym przy

pomocy długiej szczotki wprawiła całą masę ptasią w wirowanie. Wzbił się

piekielny tuman piór, skrzydeł i krzyku, w którym Adela, podobna do

szalejącej Menady, zakrytej młyńcem swego tyrsu, tańczyła taniec

zniszczenia. Razem z ptasią gromadą ojciec mój, trzepiąc rękoma, w

przerażeniu próbował wznieść się w powietrze. Zwolna przerzedzał się

tuman skrzydlaty, aż w końcu na pobojowisku została sama Adela,

wyczerpana, dysząca, oraz mój ojciec z miną zafrasowaną i zawstydzoną,

gotów do przyjęcia każdej kapitulacji. W chwilę później schodził mój

ojciec ze schodów swojego dominium - człowiek złamany, król-banita,

który stracił tron i królowanie.



                                     MANEKINY



 Ta ptasia impreza mego ojca była ostatnim wybuchem kolorowości,

ostatnim i świetnym kontrmarszem fantazji, który ten niepoprawny

improwizator, ten fechtmistrz wyobraźni poprowadził na szańce i okopy

jałowej i pustej zimy. Dziś dopiero rozumiem samotne bohaterstwo, z

jakim sam jeden wydał on wojnę bezbrzeżnemu żywiołowi nudy drętwiącej

miasto. Pozbawiony wszelkiego poparcia, bez uznania z naszej strony

bronił ten mąż przedziwny straconej sprawy poezji. Był on cudownym

młynem, w którego leje sypały się otręby pustych godzin, ażeby w jego

trybach zakwitnąć wszystkimi kolorami i zapachami korzeni Wschodu. Ale

przywykli do świetnego kuglarstwa tego metafizycznego prestidigitatora,

byliśmy skłonni zapoznawać wartość jego suwerennej magii, która nas

ratowała od letargu pustych dni i nocy. Adeli nie spotkał żaden wyrzut

za jej bezmyślny i tępy wandalizm. Przeciwnie, czuliśmy jakie niskie

zadowolenie, haniebną satysfakcję z ukrócenia tych wybujałości, których

kosztowaliśmy łakomie do syta, ażeby potem uchylić się perfidnie od

odpowiedzialności za nie. A może był w tej zdradzie i tajny pokłon w

stronę zwycięskiej Adeli, której przypisywaliśmy niejasno jakąś misję i

posłannictwo sił wyższego rzędu. Zdradzony przez wszystkich, wycofał się

ojciec bez walki z miejsc swej niedawnej chwały. Bez skrzyżowania szpad

oddał w ręce wroga domenę swej byłej świetności. Dobrowolny banita

usunął się do pustego pokoju na końcu sieni i oszańcował się tam

samotnością. Zapomnieliśmy o nim. Obiegła nas znowu ze wszech stron

żałobna szarość miasta, zakwitając w oknach ciemnym liszajem świtów,

pasożytniczym grzybem zmierzchów, rozrastającym się w puszyste futro

długich nocy zimowych. Tapety pokojów, rozluźnione błogo za tamtych dni

i otwarte dla kolorowych lotów owej skrzydlatej czeredy, zamknęły się

znów w sobie, zgęstniały plącząc się w monotonii gorzkich monologów.

Lampy poczerniały i zwiędły jak stare osty i bodiaki. Wisiały teraz

osowiałe i zgryźliwe, dzwoniąc cicho kryształkami szkiełek, gdy kto

przeprawiał się omackiem przez zmierzch pokoju. Na próżno wetknęła Adela

we wszystkie ramiona tych lamp kolorowe świece, nieudolny surogat, blade

wspomnienie świetnych iluminacji, którymi kwitły niedawno wiszące ich

ogrody. Ach! gdzie było to świegotliwe pączkowanie, to owocowanie

pośpieszne i fantastyczne w bukietach tych lamp, z których jak z

pękających czarodziejskich tortów ulatywały skrzydlate fantazmaty,

rozbijające powietrze na talie kart magicznych, rozsypując je w kolorowe

oklaski, sypiące się gęstymi łuskami lazuru, pawiej, papuziej zieleni,

metalicznych połysków, rysując w powietrzu linie i arabeski, migotliwe

ślady lotów i kołowań, rozwijając kolorowe wachlarze trzepotów,

utrzymujące się długo po przelocie w bogatej i błyskotliwej atmosferze.

Jeszcze teraz kryły się w głębi zszarzałej aury echa i możliwości

barwnych rozbłysków, lecz nikt nie nawiercał fletem, nie doświadczał

świdrem zmętniałych słojów powietrznych. Tygodnie te stały pod znakiem

dziwnej senności. Łóżka cały dzień nie zaścielone, zawalone pościelą

zmiętą i wytarzaną od ciężkich snów, stały jak głębokie łodzie gotowe do

odpływu w mokre i zawiłe labirynty jakiejś czarnej, bezgwiezdnej

Wenecji. O głuchym świcie Adela przynosiła nam kawę. Ubieraliśmy się

leniwie w zimnych pokojach, przy świetle świecy odbitej wielokrotnie w

czarnych szybach okien. Poranki te były pełne bezładnego krzątania się,

rozwlekłego szukania w różnych szufladach i szafach. Po całym mieszkaniu

słychać było kłapanie pantofelków Adeli. Subiekci zapalali latarnie,

brali z rąk matki wielkie klucze sklepowe i wychodzili w gęstą, wirującą

ciemność. Matka nie mogła dojść do ładu z toaletą. Świece dogasały w

lichtarzu. Adela przepadała gdzie w odległych pokojach lub na strychu,

gdzie rozwieszała bieliznę. Nie można jej się było dowołać. Młody

jeszcze, mętny i brudny ogień w piecu lizał zimne, błyszczące narośle

sadzy w gardzieli komina. Świeca gasła, pokój pogrążał się w ciemności.

Z głowami na obrusie stołu, wród resztek śniadania zasypialiśmy na wpół

ubrani. Leżąc twarzami na futrzanym brzuchu ciemności, odpływaliśmy na

jego falistym oddechu w bezgwiezdną nicość. Budziło nas głośne

sprzątanie Adeli. Matka nie mogła uporać się z toaletą. Nim skończyła

czesanie, subiekci wracali na obiad. Mrok na rynku przybierał kolor

złotawego dymu. Przez chwilę z tych dymnych miodów, z tych mętnych

bursztynów mogły się rozpowić kolory najpiękniejszego popołudnia. Ale

szczęśliwy moment mijał, amalgamat świtu przekwitał, wezbrany ferment

dnia, już niemal dościgły, opadał z powrotem w bezsilną szarość.

Zasiadaliśmy do stołu, subiekci zacierali czerwone z zimna ręce i nagle

proza ich rozmów sprowadzała od razu pełny dzień, szary i pusty wtorek,

dzień bez tradycji i bez twarzy. Ale gdy pojawiał się na stole półmisek

z rybą w szklistej galarecie, dwie duże ryby leżące bok przy boku, głową

do ogona jak figura zodiakalna, odpoznawaliśmy w nich herb owego dnia,

emblemat kalendarzowy bezimiennego wtorku, i rozbieraliśmy go

pospiesznie między siebie, pełni ulgi, że dzień odzyskał w nim swą

fizjonomię. Subiekci spożywali go z namaszczeniem, z powagą

kalendarzowej ceremonii. Zapach pieprzu rozchodził się po pokoju. A gdy

wytarli bułką ostatek galarety ze swych talerzy, rozważając w myśli

heraldykę następnych dni tygodnia, i na półmisku zostawały tylko głowy z

wygotowanymi oczyma - czuliśmy wszyscy, że dzień został wspólnymi siłami

pokonany i że reszta nie wchodziła już w rachubę. W samej rzeczy z

resztą tą, wydaną na jej łaskę, Adela nie robiła sobie długich

ceregieli. Wród brzęku garnków i chlustów zimnej wody likwidowała z

energią tych parę godzin do zmierzchu, które matka przesypiała na

otomanie. Tymczasem w jadalni przygotowywano już scenerię wieczoru.

Polda i Paulina, dziewczęta do szycia, rozgospodarowywały się w niej z

rekwizytami swego fachu. Na ich ramionach wniesiona wchodziła do pokoju

milcząca, nieruchoma pani, dama z kłaków i płótna, z czarną drewnianą

gałką zamiast głowy. Ale ustawiona w kącie, między drzwiami a piecem, ta

cicha dama stawała się panią sytuacji. Ze swego kąta, stojąc nieruchomo,

nadzorowała w milczeniu pracę dziewcząt. Pełna krytycyzmu i niełaski

przyjmowała ich starania i umizgi, z jakimi przyklękały przed nią,

przymierzając fragmenty sukni, znaczone białą fastrygą. Obsługiwały z

uwagą i cierpliwością milczący idol, którego nic zadowolić nie mogło.

Ten moloch był nieubłagany, jak tylko kobiece molochy być potrafią, i

odsyłał je wciąż na nowo do pracy, a one, wrzecionowate i smukłe,

podobne do szpuli drewnianych, z których odwijały się nici, i tak

ruchliwe jak one, manipulowały zgrabnymi ruchami nad tą kupą jedwabiu i

sukna, wcinały się szczękającymi nożycami w jej kolorową masę, furkotały

maszyną, depcąc pedał lakierkową, tanią nóżką, a dookoła nich rosła kupa

odpadków, różnokolorowych strzępów i szmatek, jak wyplute łuski i plewy

dookoła dwóch wybrednych i marnotrawnych papug. Krzywe szczęki nożyc

otwierały się ze skrzypieniem, jak dzioby tych kolorowych ptaków.

Dziewczęta deptały nieuważnie po barwnych obrzynkach, brodząc

nieświadomie niby w śmietniku możliwego jakiego karnawału, w rupieciami

jakiejś wielkiej nieurzeczywistnionej maskarady. Otrzepywały się ze

szmatek z nerwowym śmiechem, łaskotały oczyma zwierciadła. Ich dusze,

szybkie czarodziejstwo ich rąk było nie w nudnych sukniach, które

zostawały na stole, ale w tych setkach odstrzygnięć, w tych wiórach

lekkomyślnych i płochych, którymi zasypać mogły cale miasto, jak

kolorową fantastyczną śnieżycą. Nagle było im gorąco i otwierały okno,

ażeby w niecierpliwości swej samotni, w głodzie obcych twarzy,

przynajmniej bezimienną twarz zobaczyć, do okna przyciśniętą. Wachlowały

rozpalone swe policzki przed wzbierającą firankami nocą zimową -

odsłaniały płonące dekolty, pełne nienawiści do siebie i rywalizacji,

gotowe stanąć do walki o tego pierrota, którego by ciemny powiew nocy

przywiał na okno. Ach! jak mało wymagały one od rzeczywistości. Miały

wszystko w sobie, miały nadmiar wszystkiego w sobie. Ach! byłby im

wystarczył pierrot wypchany trocinami, jedno-dwa słowa, na które od

dawna czekały, by móc wpaść w swą rolę dawno przygotowaną, z dawna

tłoczącą się na usta, pełną słodkiej i strasznej goryczy, ponoszącą

dziko, jak stronice romansu połykane nocą wraz ze łzami ronionymi na

wypieki lic. Podczas jednej ze swych wędrówek wieczornych po mieszkaniu,

przedsiębranych pod nieobecność Adeli, natknął się mój ojciec na ten

cichy seans wieczorny. Przez chwilę stał w ciemnych drzwiach przyległego

pokoju, z lampą w ręku, oczarowany sceną pełną gorączki i wypieków, tą

idyllą z pudru, kolorowej bibułki i atropiny, której jako tło pełne

znaczenia podłożona była noc zimowa, oddychająca wśród wzdętych firanek

okna. Nakładając okulary, zbliżył się w paru krokach i obszedł dookoła

dziewczęta, oświecając je podniesioną w ręku lampą. Przeciąg z otwartych

drzwi podniósł firanki u okna, panienki dawały się oglądać, kręcąc się w

biodrach, polśniewając emalią oczu, lakiem skrzypiących pantofelków,

sprzączkami podwiązek pod wzdętą od wiatru sukienką; szmatki jęły umykać

po podłodze, jak szczury, ku uchylonym drzwiom ciemnego pokoju, a ojciec

mój przyglądał się uważnie prychającym osóbkom, szepcąc półgłosem: -

Genus avium... jeśli się nie mylę, scansores albo pistacci... w

najwyższym stopniu godne uwagi. Przypadkowe to spotkanie stało się

początkiem całej serii seansów, podczas których ojciec mój zdołał rychło

oczarować obie panienki urokiem swej przedziwnej osobistości. Odpłacając

się za pełną galanterii i dowcipu konwersację, którą zapełniał im pustkę

wieczorów - dziewczęta pozwalały zapalonemu badaczowi studiować

strukturę swych szczupłych i tandetnych ciałek. Działo się to w toku

konwersacji, z powagą i wytwornością, która najryzykowniejszym punktom

tych badań odbierała dwuznaczny ich pozór. Odsuwając pończoszkę z kolana

Pauliny i studiując rozmiłowanymi oczyma zwięzłą i szlachetną

konstrukcję przegubu, ojciec mój mówił: - Jakże pełna uroku i jak

szczęśliwa jest forma bytu, którą panie obrały. Jakże piękna i prosta

jest teza, którą dano wam swym życiem ujawnić. Lecz za to z jakim

mistrzostwem, z jaką finezją wywiązują się panie z tego zadania. Gdybym

odrzucając respekt przed Stwórcą, chciał się zabawić w krytykę

stworzenia, wołałbym: - mniej treści, więcej formy! Ach, jakby ulżył

światu ten ubytek treści. Więcej skromności w zamierzeniach, więcej

wstrzemięźliwości w pretensjach - panowie demiurdzy - a świat byłby

doskonalszy! - wołał mój ojciec akurat w momencie, gdy dłoń jego

wyłuskiwała białą łydkę Pauliny z uwięzi pończoszki. W tej chwili Adela

stanęła w otwartych drzwiach jadalni, niosąc tacę z podwieczorkiem. Było

to pierwsze spotkanie dwu tych wrogich potęg od czasu wielkiej rozprawy.

My wszyscy, którzy asystowaliśmy przy tym spotkaniu, przeżyliśmy chwilę

wielkiej trwogi. Było nam nadwyraz przykro być świadkami nowego

upokorzenia i tak już ciężko doświadczonego męża. Mój ojciec powstał z

klęczek bardzo zmieszany, falą po fali zabarwiała się jego twarz coraz

ciemniej napływem wstydu. Ale Adela znalazła się niespodzianie na

wysokości sytuacji. Podeszła z uśmiechem do ojca i dała mu prztyczka w

nos. Na to hasło Polda i Paulina klasnęły radośnie w dłonie, zatupotały

nóżkami i uwiesiwszy się z obu stron u ramion ojca, obtańczyły z nim

stół dookoła. W ten sposób, dzięki dobremu sercu dziewcząt, rozwiał się

zarodek przykrego konfliktu w ogólnej wesołości. Oto jest początek

wielce ciekawych i dziwnych prelekcji, które mój ojciec, natchniony

urokiem tego małego i niewinnego audytorium, odbywał w następnych

tygodniach owej wczesnej zimy. Jest godne uwagi, jak w zetknięciu z

niezwykłym tym człowiekiem rzeczy wszystkie cofały się niejako do

korzenia swego bytu, odbudowywały swe zjawisko aż do metafizycznego

jądra, wracały niejako do pierwotnej idei, ażeby w tym punkcie

sprzeniewierzyć się jej i przechylić w te wątpliwe, ryzykowne i

dwuznaczne regiony, które nazwiemy tu krótko regionami wielkiej herezji.

Nasz herezjarcha szedł wśród rzeczy jak magnetyzer, zarażając je i

uwodząc swym niebezpiecznym czarem. Czy mam nazwać i Paulinę jego

ofiarą? Stała się ona w owych dniach jego uczennicą, adeptką jego

teoryj, modelem jego eksperymentów. Tutaj postaram się wyłożyć z

należytą ostrożnością, i unikając zgorszenia, tę nader kacerską

doktrynę, która opętała wówczas na długie miesiące mego ojca i opanowała

wszystkie jego poczynania.



                          TRAKTAT O MANEKINACH ALBO

                             WTÓRA KSIĘGA RODZAJU



 Demiurgos - mówił mój ojciec - nie posiadł monopolu na tworzenie - tworzenie jest przywilejem

wszystkich duchów. Materii dana jest nieskończona płodność,

niewyczerpana moc życiowa i zarazem uwodna siła pokusy, która nas nęci

do formowania. W głębi materii kształtują się niewyraźne uśmiechy,

zawiązują się napięcia, zgęszczają się próby kształtów. Cała materia

faluje od nieskończonych możliwości, które przez nią przechodzą mdłymi

dreszczami. Czekając na ożywcze tchnienie ducha, przelewa się ona w

sobie bez końca, kusi tysiącem słodkich okrąglizn i miękkości, które z

siebie w ślepych rojeniach wymajacza. Pozbawiona własnej inicjatywy,

lubieżnie podatna, po kobiecemu plastyczna, uległa wobec wszystkich

impulsów - stanowi ona teren wyjęty spod prawa, otwarty dla wszelkiego

rodzaju szarlatanerii i dyletantyzmów, domenę wszelkich nadużyć i

wątpliwych manipulacji demiurgicznych. Materia jest najbierniejszą i

najbezbronniejszą istotą w kosmosie. Każdy może ją ugniatać, formować,

każdemu jest posłuszna. Wszystkie organizacje materii są nietrwałe i

luźne, łatwe do uwstecznienia i rozwiązania. Nie ma żadnego zła w

redukcji życia do form innych i nowych. Zabójstwo nie jest grzechem.

Jest ono nieraz koniecznym gwałtem wobec opornych i skostniałych form

bytu, które przestały być zajmujące. W interesie ciekawego i ważnego

eksperymentu może ono nawet stanowić zasługę. Tu jest punkt wyjścia dla

nowej apologii sadyzmu. Mój ojciec był niewyczerpany w gloryfikacji tego

przedziwnego elementu, jakim była materia. - Nie ma materii martwej -

nauczał - martwota jest jedynie pozorem, za którym ukrywają się nieznane

formy życia. Skala tych form jest nieskończona, a odcienie i niuanse

niewyczerpane. Demiurgos był w posiadaniu ważnych i ciekawych recept

twórczych. Dzięki nim stworzył on mnogość rodzajów, odnawiających się

własną siłą. Nie wiadomo, czy recepty te kiedykolwiek zostaną

zrekonstruowane. Ale jest to niepotrzebne, gdyż jeśliby nawet te

klasyczne metody kreacji okazały się raz na zawsze niedostępne,

pozostają pewne metody illegalne, cały bezmiar metod heretyckich i

występnych. W miarę jak ojciec od tych ogólnych zasad kosmogonii zbliżał

się do terenu swych ciaśniejszych zainteresowań, głos jego zniżał się do

wnikliwego szeptu, wykład stawał się coraz trudniejszy i zawilszy, a

wyniki, do których dochodził, gubiły się w coraz bardziej wątpliwych i

ryzykownych regionach. Gestykulacja jego nabierała ezoterycznej

solenności. Przymykał jedno oko, przykładał dwa palce do czoła, chytrość

jego spojrzenia stawała się wprost niesamowita. Wwiercał się tą

chytrością w swe interlokutorki, gwałcił cynizmem tego spojrzenia

najwstydliwsze, najintymniejsze w nich rezerwy i dosięgał wymykające się

w najgłębszym zakamarku, przypierał do ściany i łaskotał, drapał

ironicznym palcem, póki nie dołaskotał się błysku zrozumienia i śmiechu,

śmiechu przyznania i porozumienia się, którym w końcu musiało się

kapitulować. Dziewczęta siedziały nieruchomo, lampa kopciła, sukno pod

igłą maszyny dawno się zsunęło, a maszyna stukotała pusto, stębnując

czarne, bezgwiezdne sukno, odwijające się z postawu nocy zimowej za

oknem. - Zbyt długo żyliśmy pod terrorem niedościgłej doskonałości

Demiurga - mówił mój ojciec - zbyt długo doskonałość jego tworu

paraliżowała naszą własną twórczość. Nie chcemy z nim konkurować. Nie

mamy ambicji mu dorównać. Chcemy być twórcami we własnej, niższej

sferze, pragniemy dla siebie twórczości, pragniemy rozkoszy twórczej,

pragniemy - jednym słowem - demiurgii. - Nie wiem, w czyim imieniu

proklamował mój ojciec te postulaty, jaka zbiorowość, jaka korporacja,

sekta czy zakon, nadawała swą solidarnością patos jego słowom. Co do

nas, to bylimy dalecy od wszelkich zakusów demiurgicznych. Lecz ojciec

mój rozwinął tymczasem program tej wtórej demiurgii, obraz tej drugiej

generacji stworzeń, która stanąć miała w otwartej opozycji do panującej

epoki. - Nie zależy nam - mówił on - na tworach o długim oddechu, na

istotach na daleką metę. Nasze kreatury nie będą bohaterami romansów w

wielu tomach. Ich role będą krótkie, lapidarne, ich charaktery - bez

dalszych planów. Często dla jednego gestu, dla jednego słowa podejmiemy

się trudu powołania ich do życia na tę jedną chwilę. Przyznajemy

otwarcie: nie będziemy kładli nacisku na trwałość ani solidność

wykonania, twory nasze będą jak gdyby prowizoryczne, na jeden raz

zrobione. Jeśli będą to ludzie, to damy im na przykład tylko jedną

stronę twarzy, jedną rękę, jedną nogę, tę mianowicie, która im będzie w

ich roli potrzebna. Byłoby pedanterią troszczyć się o ich drugą, nie

wchodzącą w grę nogę. Z tyłu mogą być po prostu zaszyte płótnem lub

pobielone. Naszą ambicję pokładać będziemy w tej dumnej dewizie: dla

każdego gestu inny aktor. Do obsługi każdego słowa, każdego czynu

powołamy do życia innego człowieka. Taki jest nasz smak, to będzie świat

według naszego gustu. Demiurgos kochał się w wytrawnych, doskonałych i

skomplikowanych materiałach, my dajemy pierwszeństwo tandecie. Po prostu

porywa nas, zachwyca taniość, lichota, tandetność materiału. Czy

rozumiecie - pytał mój ojciec - głęboki sens tej słabości, tej pasji do

pstrej bibułki, do papier mâché , do lakowej farby, do kłaków i

trociny? To jest - mówił z bolesnym umiechem - nasza miłość do materii

jako takiej, do jej puszystości i porowatości, do jej jedynej,

mistycznej konsystencji. Demiurgos, ten wielki mistrz i artysta, czyni

ją niewidzialną, każe jej zniknąć pod grą życia. My, przeciwnie, kochamy

jej zgrzyt, jej oporność, jej pałubiastą niezgrabność. Lubimy pod każdym

gestem, pod każdym ruchem widzieć jej ociężały wysiłek, jej bezwład, jej

słodką niedwiedziowatość. Dziewczęta siedziały nieruchomo z szklanymi

oczyma. Twarze ich były wyciągnięte i zgłupiałe zasłuchaniem, policzki

podmalowane wypiekami, trudno było w tej chwili ocenić, czy należą do

pierwszej, czy do drugiej generacji stworzenia. - Słowem - konkludował

mój ojciec - chcemy stworzyć po raz wtóry człowieka, na obraz i

podobieństwo manekinu. Tu musimy dla wierności sprawozdawczej opisać

pewien drobny i błahy incydent, który zaszedł w tym punkcie prelekcji i

do którego nie przywiązujemy żadnej wagi. Incydent ten, całkowicie

niezrozumiały i bezsensowny w tym danym szeregu zdarzeń, da się chyba

wytłumaczyć jako pewnego rodzaju automatyzm szczątkowy, bez antecedensów

i bez ciągłości, jako pewnego rodzaju złośliwość obiektu, przeniesiona w

dziedzinę psychiczną. Radzimy czytelnikowi zignorować go z równą

lekkomyślnością, jak my to czynimy. Oto jego przebieg: W chwili gdy mój

ojciec wymawiał słowo manekin, Adela spojrzała na zegarek na

bransoletce, po czym porozumiała się spojrzeniem z Poldą. Teraz wysunęła

się wraz z krzesłem o piędź naprzód, podniosła brzeg sukni, wystawiła

powoli stopę, opiętą w czarny jedwab, i wyprężyła ją jak pyszczek węża.

Tak siedziała przez cały czas tej sceny, całkiem sztywno, z wielkimi,

trzepoczącymi oczyma, pogłębionymi lazurem atropiny, z Poldą i Pauliną

po obu bokach. Wszystkie trzy patrzyły rozszerzonymi oczami na ojca. Mój

ojciec chrząknął, zamilkł, pochylił się i stał się nagle bardzo

czerwony. W jednej chwili lineatura jego twarzy, dopiero co tak

rozwichrzona i pełna wibracji, zamknęła się na spokorniałych rysach. On

- herezjarcha natchniony, ledwo wypuszczony z wichru uniesienia - złożył

się nagle w sobie, zapadł i zwinął. A może wymieniono go na innego. Ten

inny siedział sztywny, bardzo czerwony, ze spuszczonymi oczyma. Panna

Polda podeszła i pochyliła się nad nim. Klepiąc go lekko po plecach,

mówiła tonem łagodnej zachęty: - Jakub będzie rozsądny, Jakub posłucha,

Jakub nie będzie uparty. No, proszę... Jakub, Jakub... Wypięty

pantofelek Adeli drżał lekko i błyszczał jak języczek węża. Mój ojciec

podniósł się powoli ze spuszczonymi oczyma, postąpił krok naprzód, jak

automat, i osunął się na kolana. Lampa syczała w ciszy, w gęstwinie

tapet biegły tam i z powrotem wymowne spojrzenia, leciały szepty

jadowitych języków, gzygzaki myśli...



                       TRAKTAT O MANEKINACH

                              Ciąg dalszy



Następnego wieczora ojciec podjął z odnowioną swadą ciemny i zawiły

swój temat. Lineatura jego zmarszczek rozwijała się i zawijała

 z wyrafinowaną chytrością. W każdej spirali ukryty był pocisk ironii.

 Ale czasami inspiracja rozszerzała kręgi jego

zmarszczek, które rosły jaką ogromną wirującą grozą, uchodząc w

milczących wolutach w głąb nocy zimowej. - Figury panopticum, moje panie

- zaczął on - kalwaryjskie parodie manekinów, ale nawet w tej postaci

strzeżcie się lekko je traktować. Materia nie zna żartów. Jest ona

zawsze pełna tragicznej powagi. Kto ośmiela się myśleć, że można igrać z

materią, że kształtować ją można dla żartu, że żart nie wrasta w nią,

nie wżera się natychmiast jak los, jak przeznaczenie? Czy przeczuwacie

ból, cierpienie głuche, nie wyzwolone, zakute w materię cierpienie tej

pałuby, która nie wie, czemu nią jest, czemu musi trwać w tej gwałtem

narzuconej formie, będącej parodią? Czy pojmujecie potęgę wyrazu, formy,

pozoru, tyrańską samowolę, z jaką rzuca się on na bezbronną kłodę i

opanowuje, jak własna, tyrańska, panosząca się dusza? Nadajecie jakiej

głowie z kłaków i płótna wyraz gniewu i pozostawiacie ją z tym gniewem,

z tą konwulsją, z tym napięciem raz na zawsze, zamkniętą ze ślepą

złością, dla której nie ma odpływu. Tłum śmieje się z tej parodii.

Płaczcie, moje panie, nad losem własnym, widząc nędzę materii więzionej,

gnębionej materii, która nie wie, kim jest i po co jest, dokąd prowadzi

ten gest, który jej raz na zawsze nadano. Tłum śmieje się. Czy

rozumiecie straszny sadyzm, upajające, demiurgiczne okrucieństwo tego

śmiechu? Bo przecież płakać nam, moje panie, trzeba nad losem własnym na

widok tej nędzy materii, gwałconej materii, na której dopuszczono się

strasznego bezprawia. Stąd płynie, moje panie, straszny smutek

wszystkich błazeńskich golemów, wszystkich pałub, zadumanych tragicznie

nad śmiesznym swym grymasem. Oto jest anarchista Luccheni, morderca

cesarzowej Elżbiety, oto Draga, demoniczna i nieszczęśliwa królowa

Serbii, oto genialny młodzieniec, nadzieja i duma rodu, którego zgubił

nieszczęsny nałóg onanii. O, ironio tych nazw, tych pozorów! Czy jest w

tej pałubie naprawdę co z królowej Dragi, jej sobowtór, najdalszy bodaj

cień jej istoty? To podobieństwo, ten pozór, ta nazwa uspokaja nas i nie

pozwala nam pytać, kim jest dla siebie samego ten twór nieszczęśliwy. A

jednak to musi być kto, moje panie, kto anonimowy, kto groźny, kto

nieszczęśliwy, kto, co nie słyszał nigdy w swym głuchym życiu o

królowej Dradze... Czy słyszeliście po nocach straszne wycie tych pałub

woskowych, zamkniętych w budach jarmarcznych, żałosny chór tych kadłubów

z drzewa i porcelany, walących pięściami w ściany swych więzień? W

twarzy mego ojca, rozwichrzonej grozą spraw, które wywołał z ciemności,

utworzył się wir zmarszczek, lej rosnący w głąb, na którego dnie gorzało

groźne oko prorocze. Broda jego zjeżyła się dziwnie, wiechcie i pędzle

włosów, strzelające z brodawek, z pieprzów, z dziurek od nosa,

nastroszyły się na swych korzonkach. Tak stał drętwy, z gorejącymi

oczyma, drżąc od wewnętrznego wzburzenia, jak automat, który zaciął się

i zatrzymał na martwym punkcie. Adela wstała z krzesła i poprosiła nas o

przymknięcie oczu na to, co się za chwilę stanie. Potem podeszła do ojca

i z rękoma na biodrach, przybierając pozór podkreślonej stanowczoci,

zażądała bardzo dobitnie... Panienki siedziały sztywno, ze spuszczonymi

oczyma, w dziwnej drętwości.



                         TRAKTAT O MANEKINACH

                                 Dokończenie



Któregoś z następnych wieczorów ojciec

mój w te słowa ciągnął dalej swą prelekcję: Nie o tych

nieporozumieniach ucieleśnionych, nie o tych smutnych parodiach, moje

panie, owocach prostackiej i wulgarnej niepowściągliwoci - chciałem

mówić zapowiadając mą rzecz o manekinach. Miałem na myśli co innego. Tu

ojciec mój zaczął budować przed naszymi oczyma obraz tej wymarzonej

przez niego generatio aequivoca, jakiegoś pokolenia istot na wpół

tylko organicznych, jakiejś pseudowegetacji i pseudofauny, rezultatów

fantastycznej fermentacji materii. Były to twory podobne z pozoru do

istot żywych, do kręgowców, skorupiaków, członkonogów, lecz pozór ten

mylił. Były to w istocie istoty amorfne, bez wewnętrznej struktury,

płody imitatywnej tendencji materii, która obdarzona pamięcią, powtarza

z przyzwyczajenia raz przyjęte kształty. Skala morfologii, której

podlega materia, jest w ogóle ograniczona i pewien zasób form powtarza

się wciąż na różnych kondygnacjach bytu. Istoty te - ruchliwe, wrażliwe

na bodźce, a jednak dalekie od prawdziwego życia - można było otrzymać

zawieszając pewne skomplikowane koloidy w roztworach soli kuchennej.

Koloidy te po kilku dniach formowały się, organizowały w pewne

zagęszczenia substancji przypominającej niższe formy fauny. U istot tak

powstałych można było stwierdzić proces oddychania, przemianę materii,

ale analiza chemiczna nie wykazywała w nich nawet śladu połączeń

białkowych ani w ogóle związków węgla. Wszelako prymitywne te formy były

niczym w porównaniu z bogactwem kształtów i wspaniałości pseudofauny i

flory, która pojawia się niekiedy w pewnych ściśle określonych

środowiskach. Środowiskami tymi są stare mieszkania, przesycone

emanacjami wielu żywotów i zdarzeń - zużyte atmosfery, bogate w

specyficzne ingrediencje marzeń ludzkich - rumowiska, obfitujące w humus

wspomnień, tęsknot, jałowej nudy. Na takiej glebie owa pseudowegetacja

kiełkowała szybko i powierzchownie, pasożytowała obficie i efemerycznie,

pędziła krótkotrwałe generacje, które rozkwitały raptownie i świetnie,

ażeby wnet zgasnąć i zwiędnąć. Tapety muszą być w takich mieszkaniach

już bardzo zużyte i znudzone nieustanną wędrówką po wszystkich

kadencjach rytmów; nic dziwnego, że schodzą na manowce dalekich,

ryzykownych rojeń. Rdzeń mebli, ich substancja musi już być rozluźniona,

zdegenerowana i podległa występnym pokusom: wtedy na tej chorej,

zmęczonej i zdziczałej glebie wykwita, jak piękna wysypka, nalot

fantastyczny, kolorowa, bujająca pleśń. - Wiedzą panie - mówił ojciec

mój - że w starych mieszkaniach bywają pokoje, o których się zapomina.

Nie odwiedzane miesiącami, więdną w opuszczeniu między starymi murami i

zdarza się, że zasklepiają się w sobie, zarastają cegłą i, raz na zawsze

stracone dla naszej pamięci, powoli tracą też swą egzystencję. Drzwi,

prowadzące do nich z jakiego podestu tylnych schodów, mogą być tak

długo przeoczane przez domowników, aż wrastają, wchodzą w ścianę, która

zaciera ich ślad w fantastycznym rysunku pęknięć i rys. - Wszedłem raz -

mówił ojciec mój - wczesnym rankiem na schyłku zimy, po wielu miesiącach

nieobecności, do takiego na wpół zapomnianego traktu i zdumiony byłem

wyglądem tych pokojów. Z wszystkich szpar w podłodze, z wszystkich

gzymsów i framug wystrzelały cienkie pędy i napełniały szare powietrze

migotliwą koronką filigranowego listowia, ażurową gęstwiną jakiejś

cieplarni, pełnej szeptów, lśnień, kołysań, jakiejś fałszywej i błogiej

wiosny. Dookoła łóżka, pod wieloramienną lampą, wzdłuż szaf chwiały się

kępy delikatnych drzew, rozpryskiwały w górze w świetliste korony, w

fontanny koronkowego listowia, bijące aż pod malowane niebo sufitu

rozpylonym chlorofilem. W przyspieszonym procesie kwitnienia kiełkowały

w tym listowiu ogromne, białe i różowe kwiaty, pączkowały w oczach,

bujały od środka różowym miąższem i przelewały się przez brzegi, gubiąc

płatki i rozpadając się w prędkim przekwitaniu. - Byłem szczęśliwy -

mówił mój ojciec - z tego niespodzianego rozkwitu, który napełnił

powietrze migotliwym szelestem, łagodnym szumem, przesypującym się jak

kolorowe confetti przez cienkie rózgi gałązek. Widziałem, jak z drgania

powietrza, z fermentacji zbyt bogatej aury wydziela się i materializuje

to pospieszne kwitnienie, przelewanie się i rozpadanie fantastycznych

oleandrów, które napełniły pokój rzadką, leniwą śnieżycą wielkich,

różowych kici kwietnych. - Nim zapadł wieczór - kończył ojciec - nie

było już śladu tego świetnego rozkwitu. Cała złudna ta fatamorgana była

tylko mistyfikacją, wypadkiem dziwnej symulacji materii, która podszywa

się pod pozór życia. Ojciec mój był dnia tego dziwnie ożywiony,

spojrzenia jego, chytre, ironiczne spojrzenia, tryskały werwą i humorem.

Potem, nagle poważniejąc, znów rozpatrywał nieskończoną skalę form i

odcieni, jakie przybierała wielokształtna materia. Fascynowały go formy

graniczne, wątpliwe i problematyczne, jak ektoplazma somnambulików,

pseudomateria, emanacja kataleptyczna mózgu, która w pewnych wypadkach

rozrastała się z ust uśpionego na cały stół, napełniała cały pokój, jako

bujająca, rzadka tkanka, astralne ciasto, na pograniczu ciała i ducha.

 - Kto wie - mówił - ile jest cierpiących, okaleczonych, fragmentarycznych

postaci życia, jak sztucznie sklecone, gwoździami na gwałt zbite życie

szaf i stołów, ukrzyżowanego drzewa, cichych męczenników okrutnej

pomysłowości ludzkiej. Straszliwe transplantacje obcych i nienawidzących

się ras drzewa, skucie ich w jedną nieszczęliwą osobowość. Ile starej,

mądrej męki jest w bejcowanych słojach, żyłach i fladrach naszych

starych, zaufanych szaf. Kto rozpozna w nich stare, zheblowane,

wypolerowane do niepoznaki rysy, umiechy, spojrzenia! Twarz mego ojca,

gdy to mówił, rozeszła się zamyśloną lineaturą zmarszczek, stała się

podobna do sęków i słojów starej deski, z której zheblowano wszystkie

wspomnienia. Przez chwilę myślelimy, że ojciec popadnie w stan

drętwoty, który nawiedzał go czasem, ale ocknął się nagle, opamiętał i

tak ciągnął dalej: - Dawne, mistyczne plemiona balsamowały swych

umarłych. W ściany ich mieszkań były wprawione, wmurowane ciała, twarze:

w salonie stał ojciec - wypchany, wygarbowana żona-nieboszczka była

dywanem pod stołem. Znałem pewnego kapitana, który miał w swej kajucie

lampę-meluzynę, zrobioną przez malajskich balsamistów z jego

zamordowanej kochanki. Na głowie miała ogromne rogi jelenie. W ciszy

kajuty głowa ta, rozpięta między gałęziami rogów u stropu, powoli

otwierała rzęsy oczu; na rozchylonych ustach lniła błonka śliny,

pękająca od cichego szeptu. Głowonogi, żółwie i ogromne kraby,

zawieszone na belkach sufitu jako kandelabry i pająki, przebierały w tej

ciszy bez końca nogami, szły i szły na miejscu... Twarz mojego ojca

przybrała naraz wyraz troski i smutku, gdy myśli jego na drogach nie

wiedzieć jakich asocjacji przeszły do nowych przykładów: - Czy mam

przemilczeć - mówił przyciszonym głosem - że brat mój na skutek długiej

i nieuleczalnej choroby zamienił się stopniowo w zwój kiszek gumowych,

że biedna moja kuzynka dniem i nocą nosiła go w poduszkach, nucąc

nieszczęśliwemu stworzeniu nieskończone kołysanki nocy zimowych? Czy

może być coś smutniejszego niż człowiek zamieniony w kiszkę hegarową? Co

za rozczarowanie dla rodziców, co za dezorientacja dla ich uczuć, co za

rozwianie wszystkich nadziei, wiązanych z obiecującym młodzieńcem! A

jednak wierna miłość biednej kuzynki towarzyszyła mu i w tej przemianie.

- Ach! nie mogę już dłużej, nie mogę tego słuchać! - jęknęła Polda

przechylając się na krześle. - Ucisz go, Adelo... Dziewczęta wstały,

Adela podeszła do ojca i wyciągniętym palcem uczyniła ruch zaznaczający

łaskotanie. Ojciec stropił się, zamilkł i zaczął, pełen przerażenia,

cofać się tyłem przed kiwającym się palcem Adeli. Ta szła za nim ciągle,

grożąc mu jadowicie palcem, i wypierała go krok za krokiem z pokoju.

Paulina ziewnęła przeciągając się. Obie z Poldą, wsparte o siebie

ramionami, spojrzały sobie w oczy z uśmiechem.



                                     NEMROD



 Cały sierpień owego roku przebawiłem się z małym, kapitalnym

pieskiem, który pewnego dnia znalazł się na podłodze naszej kuchni,

niedołężny i piszczący, pachnący jeszcze mlekiem i niemowlęctwem, z nie

uformowanym, okrągławym, drżącym łebkiem, z łapkami jak u kreta

rozkraczonymi na boki i z najdelikatniejszą, mięciutką sierścią. Od

pierwszego wejrzenia zdobyła sobie ta kruszynka życia cały zachwyt, cały

entuzjazm chłopięcej duszy. Z jakiego nieba spadł tak niespodzianie ten

ulubieniec bogów, milszy sercu od najpiękniejszych zabawek? Że też

stare, zgoła nieinteresujące pomywaczki wpadają niekiedy na tak świetne

pomysły i przynoszą z przedmieścia - o całkiem wczesnej,

transcendentalnej porannej godzinie - takiego oto pieska do naszej

kuchni! Ach! było się jeszcze - niestety - nieobecnym, nieurodzonym z

ciemnego łona snu, a już to szczęście ziściło się, już czekało na nas,

niedołężnie leżące na chłodnej podłodze kuchni, nie docenione przez

Adelę i domowników. Dlaczego nie obudzono mnie wcześniej! Talerzyk mleka

na podłodze świadczył o macierzyńskich impulsach Adeli, świadczył

niestety także i o chwilach przeszłości, dla mnie na zawsze straconej, o

rozkoszach przybranego macierzyństwa, w których nie brałem udziału. Ale

przede mną leżała jeszcze cała przyszłość. Jakiż bezmiar doświadczeń,

eksperymentów, odkryć otwierał się teraz! Sekret życia, jego

najistotniejsza tajemnica sprowadzona do tej prostszej, poręczniejszej i

zabawkowej formy odsłaniała się tu nienasyconej ciekawości. Było to

nadwyraz interesujące, mieć na własność taką odrobinkę życia, taką

cząsteczkę wieczystej tajemnicy, w postaci tak zabawnej i nowej,

budzącej nieskończoną ciekawość i respekt sekretny swą obcością,

niespodzianą transpozycją tego samego wątku życia, który i w nas był, na

formę od naszej odmienną, zwierzęcą. Zwierzęta! cel nienasyconej

ciekawości, egzemplifikacje zagadki życia, jakby stworzone po to, by

człowiekowi pokazać człowieka, rozkładając jego bogactwo i komplikację

na tysiąc kalejdoskopowych możliwości, każdą doprowadzoną do jakiegoś

paradoksalnego krańca, do jakiejś wybujałości pełnej charakteru.

Nieobciążone splotem egzotycznych interesów, mącących stosunki

międzyludzkie, otwierało się serce pełne sympatii dla obcych emanacji

wiecznego życia, pełne miłosnej współpracującej ciekawości, która była

zamaskowanym głosem samopoznania. Piesek był aksamitny, ciepły i

pulsujący małym, pospiesznym sercem. Miał dwa miękkie płatki uszu,

niebieskawe, mętne oczka, różowy pyszczek, do którego można było włożyć

palec bez żadnego niebezpieczeństwa, łapki delikatne i niewinne, z

wzruszającą, różową brodaweczką z tyłu, nad stopami przednich nóg.

Właził nimi do miski z mlekiem, żarłoczny i niecierpliwy, chłepcący

napój różowym języczkiem, ażeby po nasyceniu się podnieść żałośnie małą

mordkę z kroplą mleka na brodzie i wycofać się niedołężnie z kąpieli

mlecznej. Chód jego był niezgrabnym toczeniem się, bokiem na ukos w

niezdecydowanym kierunku, po linii trochę pijanej i chwiejnej. Dominantą

jego nastroju była jaka nieokreślona i zasadnicza żałość, sieroctwo i

bezradność - niezdolność do zapełnienia czymś pustki życia pomiędzy

sensacjami posiłków. Objawiało się to bezplanowością i niekonsekwencją

ruchów, irracjonalnymi napadami nostalgii z żałosnym skomleniem i

niemożnością znalezienia sobie miejsca. Nawet jeszcze w głębi snu, w

którym potrzebę oparcia się i przytulenia zaspokajać musiał używając do

tego własnej swej osoby, zwiniętej w kłębek drżący - towarzyszyło mu

poczucie osamotnienia i bezdomności. Ach, życie - młode i wątłe życie,

wypuszczone z zaufanej ciemności, z przytulnego ciepła łona

macierzystego w wielki i obcy, świetlany świat, jakże kurczy się ono i

cofa, jak wzdraga się zaakceptować tę imprezę, którą mu proponują -

pełne awersji i zniechęcenia! Lecz zwolna mały Nemrod (otrzymał był to

dumne i wojownicze imię) zaczyna smakować w życiu. Wyłączne opanowanie

obrazem macierzystej prajedni ustępuje urokowi wielości. Świat zaczyna

nań nastawiać pułapki: nieznany a czarujący smak różnych pokarmów,

czworobok porannego słońca na podłodze, na którym tak dobrze jest

położyć się, ruchy własnych członków, własne łapki, ogonek, figlarnie

wyzywający do zabawy z samym sobą, pieszczoty ręki ludzkiej, pod którymi

zwolna dojrzewa pewna swawolność, wesołość rozpierająca ciało i rodząca

potrzebę zgoła nowych, gwałtownych i ryzykownych ruchów - wszystko to

przekupuje, przekonywa i zachęca do przyjęcia, do pogodzenia się z

eksperymentem życia. I jeszcze jedno. Nemrod zaczyna rozumieć, że to, co

mu się tu podsuwa, mimo pozorów nowości jest w gruncie rzeczy czymś, co

już było - było wiele razy - nieskończenie wiele razy. Jego ciało

poznaje sytuacje, wrażenia i przedmioty. W gruncie rzeczy to wszystko

nie dziwi go zbytnio. W obliczu każdej nowej sytuacji daje nura w swoją

pamięć, w głęboką pamięć ciała, i szuka omackiem, gorączkowo - i bywa,

że znajduje w sobie odpowiednią reakcję już gotową: mądrość pokoleń,

złożoną w jego plazmie, w jego nerwach. Znajduje jakieś czyny, decyzje,

o których sam nie wiedział, że już w nim dojrzały, że czekały na to, by

wyskoczyć. Sceneria jego młodego życia, kuchnia z wonnymi cebrami, ze

ścierkami o skomplikowanej i intrygującej woni, z kłapaniem pantofli

Adeli, z jej hałaśliwym krzątaniem się - nie straszy go więcej. Przywykł

uważać ją za swoją domenę, zadomowił się w niej i począł rozwijać w

stosunku do niej niejasne poczucie przynależności, ojczyzny. Chyba że

niespodzianie spadał nań kataklizm w postaci szorowania podłogi -

obalenie praw natury, chlusty ciepłego ługu, podmywające wszystkie

meble, i groźny szurgot szczotek Adeli. Ale niebezpieczeństwo mija,

szczotka uspokojona i nieruchoma leży cicho w kącie, schnąca podłoga

pachnie miło mokrym drzewem. Nemrod, przywrócony znowu do swych

normalnych praw i do swobody na terenie własnym, czuje żywą ochotę

chwytać zębami stary koc na podłodze i targać nim z całej siły na prawo

i lewo. Pacyfikacja żywiołów napełnia go niewymowną radością. Wtem staje

jak wryty: przed nim, o jakie trzy kroki pieskie, posuwa się czarna

maszkara, potwór sunący szybko na pręcikach wielu pogmatwanych nóg. Do

głębi wstrząśnięty Nemrod posuwa wzrokiem za skośnym kursem błyszczącego

owada, śledząc w napięciu ten płaski, bezgłowy i ślepy kadłub, niesiony

niesamowitą ruchliwocią pajęczych nóg. Co w nim na ten widok wzbiera,

co dojrzewa, pęcznieje, czego sam jeszcze nie rozumie, niby jaki gniew

albo strach, lecz raczej przyjemny i połączony z dreszczem siły,

samopoczucia, agresywności. I nagle opada na przednie łapki i wyrzuca z

siebie głos, jeszcze jemu samemu nie znany, obcy, całkiem niepodobny do

zwykłego kwilenia. Wyrzuca go z siebie raz, i jeszcze raz, i jeszcze,

cienkim dyszkantem, który się co chwila wykoleja. Ale nadaremnie

apostrofuje owada w tym nowym, z nagłego natchnienia zrodzonym języku. W

kategoriach umysłu karakoniego nie ma miejsca na tę tyradę i owad odbywa

dalej swą skośną turę ku kątowi pokoju, wśród ruchów uświęconych

odwiecznym karakonim rytuałem. Wszelako uczucia nienawiści nie mają

jeszcze trwałości i mocy w duszy pieska. Nowoobudzona radość życia

przeistacza każde uczucie w wesołość. Nemrod szczeka jeszcze, lecz sens

tego szczekania zmienił się niepostrzeżenie, stało się ono swoją własną

parodią - pragnąc w gruncie rzeczy wysłowić niewymowną udatność tej

świetnej imprezy życia, pełnej pikanterii, niespodzianych dreszczyków i

point.



                                        PAN



 W kącie między tylnymi ścianami szop i przybudówek był zaułek

podwórza, najdalsza, ostatnia odnoga, zamknięta między komorę, wychodek

i tylną ścianę kurnika - głucha zatoka, poza którą nie było już wyjścia.

Był to najdalszy przylądek, Gibraltar tego podwórza, bijący rozpaczliwie

głową w ślepy parkan z poziomych desek, zamykającą i ostateczną ścianę

tego świata. Spod jego omszonych dyli wyciekała strużka czarnej,

śmierdzącej wody, żyła gnijącego, tłustego błota, nigdy nie wysychająca

- jedyna droga, która poprzez granice parkanu wyprowadzała w świat. Ale

rozpacz smrodliwego zaułka tak długo biła głową w tę zaporę, aż

rozluźniła jedną z poziomych, potężnych desek. My, chłopcy, dokonaliśmy

reszty i wyważyli, wysunęli ciężką omszałą deskę z osady. Tak zrobiliśmy

wyłom, otworzyliśmy okno na słońce. Stanąwszy nogą na desce, rzuconej

jak most przez kałużę, mógł więzień podwórza w poziomej pozycji

przecisnąć się przez szparę, która wypuszczała go w nowy, przewiewny i

rozległy świat. Był tam wielki, zdziczały stary ogród. Wysokie grusze,

rozłożyste jabłonie rosły tu z rzadka potężnymi grupami, obsypane

srebrnym szelestem, kipiącą siatką białawych połysków. Bujna, zmieszana,

nie koszona trawa pokrywała puszystym kożuchem falisty teren. Były tam

zwykłe, trawiaste źdźbła łąkowe z pierzastymi kitami kłosów; były

delikatne filigrany dzikich pietruszek i marchwi; pomarszczone i

szorstkie listki bluszczyków i ślepych pokrzyw, pachnące miętą;

łykowate, błyszczące babki, nakrapiane rdzą, wystrzelające kićmi

grubej, czerwonej kaszy. Wszystko to, splątane i puszyste, przepojone

było łagodnym powietrzem, podbite błękitnym wiatrem i napuszczone

niebem. Gdy się leżało w trawie, było się przykrytym całą błękitną

geografią obłoków i płynących kontynentów, oddychało się całą rozległą

mapą niebios. Od tego obcowania z powietrzem liście i pędy pokryły się

delikatnymi włoskami, miękkim nalotem puchu, szorstką szczeciną haczków,

jak gdyby dla chwytania i zatrzymywania przepływów tlenu. Ten nalot

delikatny i białawy spokrewniał liście z atmosferą, dawał im srebrzysty,

szary połysk fal powietrznych, cienistych zadumań między dwoma błyskami

słońca. A jedna z tych roślin, żółta i pełna mlecznego soku w bladych

łodygach, nadęta powietrzem, pędziła ze swych pustych pędów już samo

powietrze, sam puch w kształcie pierzastych kul mleczowych rozsypywanych

przez powiew i wsiąkających bezgłośnie w błękitną ciszę. Ogród był

rozległy i rozgałęziony kilku odnogami i miał różne strefy i klimaty. W

jednej stronie był otwarty, pełen mleka niebios i powietrza, i tam

podścielał niebu co najmiększą, najdelikatniejszą, najpuszystszą zieleń.

Ale w miarę jak opadał w głąb długiej odnogi i zanurzał się w cień

między tylną ścianę opuszczonej fabryki wody sodowej, wyraźnie

pochmurniał, stawał się opryskliwy i niedbały, zapuszczał się dziko i

niechlujnie, srożył się pokrzywami, zjeżał bodiakami, parszywiał

chwastem wszelkim, aż w samym końcu między ścianami, w szerokiej

prostokątnej zatoce tracił wszelką miarę i wpadał w szał. Tam to nie był

już sad, tylko paroksyzm szaleństwa, wybuch wciekłości, cyniczny

bezwstyd i rozpusta. Tam, rozbestwione, dając upust swej pasji,

panoszyły się puste, zdziczałe kapusty łopuchów - ogromne wiedźmy,

rozdziewające się w biały dzień ze swych szerokich spódnic, zrzucając je

z siebie, spódnica za spódnicą, aż ich wzdęte, szelestne, dziurawe

łachmany oszalałymi płatami grzebały pod sobą kłótliwe to plemię

bękarcie. A żarłoczne spódnice puchły i rozpychały się, piętrzyły się

jedne na drugich, rozpierały i nakrywały wzajem, rosnąc razem wzdętą

masą blach listnych, aż pod niski okap stodoły. Tam to było, gdziem go

ujrzał jedyny raz w życiu, o nieprzytomnej od żaru godzinie południa.

Była to chwila, kiedy czas, oszalały i dziki, wyłamuje się z kieratu

zdarzeń i jak zbiegły włóczęga pędzi z krzykiem na przełaj przez pola.

Wtedy lato, pozbawione kontroli, rośnie bez miary i rachuby na całej

przestrzeni, rośnie z dzikim impetem na wszystkich punktach, w

dwójnasób, w trójnasób, w inny jaki, wyrodny czas, w nieznaną dymensję,

w obłęd. O tej godzinie opanowywał mnie szał łowienia motyli, pasja

ścigania tych migocących plamek, tych błędnych, białych płatków,

trzęsących się w rozognionym powietrzu niedołężnym gzygzakiem. I

zdarzyło się wówczas, że któraś z tych jaskrawych plamek rozpadła się w

locie na dwie, potem na trzy - i ten drgający, oślepiająco biały

trójpunkt wiódł mnie, jak błędny ognik, przez szał bodiaków, palących

się w słońcu. Dopiero na granicy łopuchów zatrzymałem się, nie śmiejąc

się pogrążyć w to głuche zapadlisko. Wtedy nagle ujrzałem go. Zanurzony

po pachy w łopuchach, kucał przede mną. Widziałem jego grube bary w

brudnej koszuli i niechlujny strzęp surduta. Przyczajony jak do skoku,

siedział tak - z barami jakby wielkim ciężarem zgarbionymi. Ciało jego

dyszało z natężenia, a z miedzianej, błyszczącej w słońcu twarzy lał się

pot. Nieruchomy, zdawał się ciężko pracować, mocować się bez ruchu z

jakim ogromnym brzemieniem. Stałem, przygwożdżony jego wzrokiem, który

mnie ujął jakby w kleszcze. Była to twarz włóczęgi lub pijaka. Wiecheć

brudnych kłaków wichrzył się nad czołem wysokim i wypukłym jak buła

kamienna, utoczona przez rzekę. Ale czoło to było skręcone w głębokie

bruzdy. Nie wiadomo, czy ból, czy palący żar słońca, czy nadludzkie

natężenie wkręciło się tak w tę twarz i napięło rysy do pęknięcia.

Czarne oczy wbiły się we mnie z natężeniem najwyższej rozpaczy czy bólu.

Te oczy patrzyły na mnie i nie patrzyły, widziały mnie i nie widziały

wcale. Były to pękające gałki, wytężone najwyższym uniesieniem bólu albo

dziką rozkoszą natchnienia. I nagle z tych rysów, naciągniętych do

pęknięcia, wyboczył się jakiś straszny, załamany cierpieniem grymas i

ten grymas rósł, brał w siebie tamten obłęd i natchnienie, pęczniał nim,

wybaczał się coraz bardziej, aż wyłamał się ryczącym, charczącym kaszlem

śmiechu. Do głębi wstrząśnięty, widziałem, jak hucząc śmiechem z

potężnych piersi, dźwignął się powoli z kucek i zgarbiony jak goryl, z

rękoma w opadających łachmanach spodni, uciekał, człapiąc przez łopocące

blachy łopuchów, wielkimi skokami - Pan bez fletu, cofający się w

popłochu do swych ojczystych kniei.



                                  PAN KAROL



 Po południu w sobotę mój wuj, Karol, wdowiec słomiany,

wybierał się pieszo do letniska, oddalonego o godzinę drogi od miasta,

do żony i dzieci, które tam na wywczasach bawiły. Od czasu wyjazdu żony

mieszkanie było nie sprzątane, łóżko nie zaścielane nigdy. Pan Karol

przychodził do mieszkania późną nocą, sponiewierany, spustoszony przez

nocne pohulanki, przez które go wlokły te dni upalne i puste. Zmięta,

chłodna, dziko rozrzucona pościel była dlań wówczas jakąś błogą

przystanią, wyspą zbawczą, do której przypadał ostatkiem sił jak

rozbitek, miotany wiele dni i nocy przez wzburzone morze. Omackiem, w

ciemności zapadał się gdzieś między białawe chmury, pasma i zwały

chłodnego pierza i spał tak w niewiadomym kierunku, na wspak, głową na

dół, wbity ciemieniem w puszysty miąższ pościeli, jak gdyby chciał we

śnie przewiercić, przewędrować na wskroś te rosnące nocą, potężne masywy

pierzyn. Walczył we śnie z tą pościelą, jak pływak z wodą, ugniatał ją i

miesił ciałem, jak ogromną dzieżę ciasta, w którą się zapadał, i budził

się o szarym świcie zdyszany, oblany potem, wyrzucony na brzeg tego

stosu pościeli, którego zmóc nie mógł w ciężkich zapasach nocnych. Tak

na wpół wyrzucony z toni snu, wisiał przez chwilę nieprzytomny na

krawędzi nocy, chwytając piersiami powietrze, a pościel rosła dokoła

niego, puchła i nakisała - i zarastała go znowu zwałem ciężkiego,

białawego ciasta. Spał tak do późnego przedpołudnia, podczas gdy

poduszki układały się w wielką, białą, płaską równinę, po której

wędrował uspokojony sen jego. Tymi białymi gościńcami powracał powoli do

siebie, do dnia, do jawy - i wreszcie otwierał oczy, jak śpiący pasażer,

gdy pociąg zatrzymuje się na stacji. W pokoju panował odstały półmrok z

osadem wielu dni samotności i ciszy. Tylko okno kipiało od rannego

rojowiska much i story płonęły jaskrawo. Pan Karol wyziewał ze swego

ciała, z głębi jam cielesnych, resztki dnia wczorajszego. To ziewanie

chwytało go tak konwulsyjnie, jak gdyby chciało go odwrócić na nice. Tak

wyrzucał z siebie ten piasek, te ciężary - nie strawione restancje dnia

wczorajszego. Ulżywszy sobie w ten sposób, i swobodniejszy, wciągał do

notesu wydatki, kalkulował, obliczał i marzył. Potem leżał długo

nieruchomy, z szklanymi oczyma, które były koloru wody, wypukłe i

wilgotne. W wodnistym półmroku pokoju, rozjaśnionym refleksem dnia

upalnego za storami, oczy jego jak maleńkie lusterka odbijały wszystkie

błyszczące przedmioty: białe plamy słońca w szparach okna, złoty

prostokąt stor, i powtarzały, jak kropla wody, cały pokój z ciszą

dywanów i pustych krzeseł. Tymczasem dzień za storami huczał coraz

płomienniej bzykaniem much oszalałych od słońca. Okno nie mogło

pomieścić tego białego pożaru i story omdlewały od jasnych falowań.

Wtedy wywlekał się z pościeli i siedział jeszcze jaki czas na łóżku,

stękając bezwiednie. Jego trzydziestokilkoletnie ciało zaczynało

skłaniać się do korpulencji. W tym organizmie, nabrzmiewającym

tłuszczem, znękanym od nadużyć płciowych, ale wciąż wzbierającym bujnymi

sokami, zdawał się teraz zwolna dojrzewać w tej ciszy jego przyszły los.

Gdy tak siedział w bezmyślnym, wegetatywnym osłupieniu, cały zamieniony

w krążenie, w respirację, w głębokie pulsowanie soków, rosła w głębi

jego ciała, spoconego i pokrytego włosem w rozlicznych miejscach, jakaś

nieświadoma, nie sformułowana przyszłość, niby potworna narośl,

wyrastająca fantastycznie w nieznaną dymensję. Nie przerażał się jej,

gdyż czuł już swoją tożsamoć z tym niewiadomym a ogromnym, które miało

nadejść, i rósł razem z nim bez sprzeciwu, w dziwnej zgodzie, zdrętwiały

spokojną grozą, odpoznając przyszłego siebie w tych kolosalnych

wykwitach, w tych fantastycznych spiętrzeniach, które przed jego

wzrokiem wewnętrznym dojrzewały. Jedno jego oko lekko wtedy zbaczało na

zewnątrz, jak gdyby odchodziło w inny wymiar. Potem z tych bezmyślnych

otumanieni z tych zatraconych dali powracał znów do siebie i do chwili;

widział swe stopy na dywanie, tłuste i delikatne jak u kobiety, i powoli

wyjmował złote spinki z mankietów dziennej koszuli. Potem szedł do

kuchni i znajdował tam w cienistym kącie wiaderko z wodą, krążek

cichego, czujnego zwierciadła, które nań tam czekało - jedyna żywa i

wiedząca istota w tym pustym mieszkaniu. Nalewał do miednicy wody i

kosztował skórą jej młodej i odstałej, słodkawej mokrości. Długo i

starannie robił toaletę, nie spiesząc się i włączając pauzy między

poszczególne manipulacje. To mieszkanie, puste i zapuszczone, nie

uznawało go, te meble i ściany śledziły za nim z milczącą krytyką. Czuł

się, wchodząc w ich ciszę, jak intruz w tym podwodnym, zatopionym

królestwie, w którym płynął inny, odrębny czas. Otwierając własne

szuflady, miał uczucie złodzieja i chodził mimo woli na palcach, bojąc

się obudzić hałaśliwe i nadmierne echo, czekające drażliwie na

najlżejszą przyczynę, by wybuchnąć. A gdy wreszcie, idąc cicho od szafy

do szafy, znajdował kawałek po kawałku wszystko potrzebne i kończył

toaletę wśród tych mebli, które tolerowały go w milczeniu, z nieobecną

miną, i wreszcie był gotów, to stojąc na odejściu z kapeluszem w ręku,

czuł się zażenowany, że i w ostatniej chwili nie mógł znaleźć słowa,

które by rozwiązało to wrogie milczenie, i odchodził ku drzwiom

zrezygnowany, zwolna, ze spuszczoną głową - gdy w przeciwną stronę

oddalał się tymczasem bez pośpiechu - w głąb zwierciadła - ktoś

odwrócony na zawsze plecami - przez pustą amfiladę pokojów, które nie

istniały.



                   SKLEPY CYNAMONOWE



 W okresie najkrótszych, sennych dni zimowych, ujętych

z obu stron, od poranku i od wieczora, w futrzane krawędzie zmierzchów,

gdy miasto rozgałęziało się coraz głębiej w labirynty zimowych nocy, z

trudem przywoływane przez krótki świt do opamiętania, do powrotu -

ojciec mój był już zatracony, zaprzedany, zaprzysiężony tamtej sferze.

Twarz jego i głowa zarastały wówczas bujnie i dziko siwym włosem,

sterczącym nieregularnie wiechciami, szczecinami, długimi pędzlami,

strzelającymi z brodawek, z brwi, z dziurek od nosa - co nadawało jego

fizjonomii wygląd starego, nastroszonego lisa. Węch jego i słuch

zaostrzał się niepomiernie i znać było po grze jego milczącej i napiętej

twarzy, że za pośrednictwem tych zmysłów pozostaje on w ciągłym

kontakcie z niewidzialnym światem ciemnych zakamarków, dziur mysich,

zmurszałych przestrzeni pustych pod podłogą i kanałów kominowych.

Wszystkie chroboty, trzaski nocne, tajne, skrzypiące życie podłogi miały

w nim nieomylnego i czujnego dostrzegacza, szpiega i współspiskowca.

Absorbowało go to w tym stopniu, że pogrążał się zupełnie w tej

niedostępnej dla nas sferze, z której nie próbował zdawać nam sprawy.

Nieraz musiał strzepywać palcami i śmiać się cicho do siebie samego, gdy

te wybryki niewidzialnej sfery stawały się zbyt absurdalne; porozumiewał

się wówczas spojrzeniem z naszym kotem, który również wtajemniczony w

ten świat, podnosił swą cyniczną, zimną, porysowaną pręgami twarz,

mrużąc z nudów i obojętnoci skośne szparki oczu. Zdarzało się podczas

obiadu, że wśród jedzenia odkładał nagle nóż i widelec i z serwetą

zawiązaną pod szyją podnosił się kocim ruchem, skradał na brzuścach

palców do drzwi sąsiedniego, pustego pokoju i z największą ostrożnością

zaglądał przez dziurkę od klucza. Potem wracał do stołu, jakby

zawstydzony, z zakłopotanym uśmiechem, wśród mruknięć i niewyraźnych

mamrotań, odnoszących się do wewnętrznego monologu, w którym był

pogrążony. Ażeby mu sprawić pewną dystrakcję i oderwać go od

chorobliwych dociekań, wyciągała go matka na wieczorne spacery, na które

szedł, milcząc, bez oporu, ale i bez przekonania, roztargniony i

nieobecny duchem. Raz nawet poszliśmy do teatru. Znaleźliśmy się znowu w

tej wielkiej, źle oświetlonej i brudnej sali, pełnej sennego gwaru

ludzkiego i bezładnego zamętu. Ale gdy przebrnęliśmy przez ciżbę ludzką,

wynurzyła się przed nami olbrzymia bladoniebieska kurtyna, jak niebo

jakiegoś innego firmamentu. Wielkie, malowane maski różowe, z wydętymi

policzkami, nurzały się w ogromnym płóciennym przestworzu. To sztuczne

niebo szerzyło się i płynęło wzdłuż i w poprzek, wzbierając ogromnym

tchem patosu i wielkich gestów, atmosferą tego świata sztucznego i

pełnego blasku, który budował się tam, na dudniących rusztowaniach

sceny. Dreszcz płynący przez wielkie oblicze tego nieba, oddech

ogromnego płótna, od którego rosły i ożywały maski, zdradzał

iluzoryczność tego firmamentu, sprawiał to drganie rzeczywistości, które

w chwilach metafizycznych odczuwamy jako migotanie tajemnicy. Maski

trzepotały czerwonymi powiekami, kolorowe wargi szeptały coś bezgłośnie

i wiedziałem, że przyjdzie chwila, kiedy napięcie tajemnicy dojdzie do

zenitu i wtedy wezbrane niebo kurtyny pęknie naprawdę, uniesie się i

ukaże rzeczy niesłychane i olśniewające. Lecz nie było mi dane doczekać

tej chwili, albowiem tymczasem ojciec zaczął zdradzać pewne oznaki

zaniepokojenia, chwytał się za kieszenie i wreszcie oświadczył, że

zapomniał portfelu z pieniędzmi i ważnymi dokumentami. Po krótkiej

naradzie z matką, w której uczciwość Adeli została poddana pospiesznej,

ryczałtowej ocenie, zaproponowano mi, żebym wyruszył do domu na

poszukiwanie portfelu. Zdaniem matki do rozpoczęcia widowiska było

jeszcze wiele czasu i przy mojej zwinności mogłem na czas powrócić.

Wyszedłem w noc zimową, kolorową od iluminacji nieba. Była to jedna z

tych jasnych nocy, w których firmament gwiezdny jest tak rozległy i

rozgałęziony, jakby rozpadł się, rozłamał i podzielił na labirynt

odrębnych niebios, wystarczających do obdzielenia całego miesiąca nocy

zimowych i do nakrycia swymi srebrnymi i malowanymi kloszami wszystkich

ich nocnych zjawisk, przygód, awantur i karnawałów. Jest lekkomyślnością

nie do darowania wysyłać w taką noc młodego chłopca z misją ważną i

pilną, albowiem w jej półświetle zwielokrotniają się, plączą i

wymieniają jedne z drugimi ulice. Otwierają się w głębi miasta, żeby tak

rzec, ulice podwójne, ulice sobowtóry, ulice kłamliwe i zwodne.

Oczarowana i zmylona wyobraźnia wytwarza złudne plany miasta, rzekomo

dawno znane i wiadome, w których te ulice mają swe miejsce i nazwę, a

noc w niewyczerpanej swej płodności nie ma nic lepszego do roboty, jak

dostarczać wciąż nowych i urojonych konfiguracji. Te kuszenia nocy

zimowych zaczynają się zazwyczaj niewinnie od chętki skrócenia sobie

drogi, użycia niezwykłego lub prędszego przejścia. Powstają ponętne

kombinacje przecięcia zawiłej wędrówki jakąś nie wypróbowaną przecznicą.

Ale tym razem zaczęło się inaczej. Uszedłszy parę kroków, spostrzegłem,

że jestem bez płaszcza. Chciałem zawrócić, lecz po chwili wydało mi się

to niepotrzebną stratą czasu, gdyż noc nie była wcale zimna, przeciwnie

- pożyłkowana strugami dziwnego ciepła, tchnieniami jakiejś fałszywej

wiosny. Śnieg skurczył się w baranki białe, w niewinne i słodkie runo,

które pachniało fiołkami. W takie same baranki rozpuściło się niebo, w

którym księżyc dwoił się i troił, demonstrując w tym zwielokrotnieniu

wszystkie swe fazy i pozycje. Niebo obnażało tego dnia wewnętrzną swą

konstrukcję w wielu jakby anatomicznych preparatach, pokazujących

spirale i słoje światła, przekroje seledynowych brył nocy, plazmę

przestworzy, tkankę rojeń nocnych. W taką noc nie podobna iść Podwalem

ani żadną inną z ciemnych ulic, które są odwrotną stroną, niejako

podszewką czterech linij rynku, i nie przypomnieć sobie, że o tej późnej

porze bywają czasem jeszcze otwarte niektóre z owych osobliwych a tyle

nęcących sklepów, o których zapomina się w dnie zwyczajne. Nazywam je

sklepami cynamonowymi dla ciemnych boazeryj tej barwy, którymi są

wyłożone. Te prawdziwie szlachetne handle, w późną noc otwarte, były

zawsze przedmiotem moich gorących marzeń. Słabo oświetlone, ciemne i

uroczyste ich wnętrza pachniały głębokim zapachem farb, laku, kadzidła,

aromatem dalekich krajów i rzadkich materiałów. Mogłeś tam znaleźć ognie

bengalskie, szkatułki czarodziejskie, marki krajów dawno zaginionych,

chińskie odbijanki, indygo, kalafonium z Malabaru, jaja owadów

egzotycznych, papug, tukanów, żywe salamandry i bazyliszki, korzeń

Mandragory, norymberskie mechanizmy, homunculusy w doniczkach,

mikroskopy i lunety, a nade wszystko rzadkie i osobliwe książki, stare

folianty pełne przedziwnych rycin i oszołamiających historyj. Pamiętam

tych starych i pełnych godności kupców, którzy obsługiwali klientów ze

spuszczonymi oczyma, w dyskretnym milczeniu, i pełni byli mądrości i

wyrozumienia dla ich najtajniejszych życzeń. Ale nade wszystko była tam

jedna księgarnia, w której raz oglądałem rzadkie i zakazane druki,

publikacje tajnych klubów, zdejmując zasłonę z tajemnic dręczących i

upojnych. Tak rzadko zdarzała się sposobność odwiedzania tych sklepów -

i w dodatku z małą, lecz wystarczającą sumą pieniędzy w kieszeni. Nie

można było pominąć tej okazji mimo ważności misji powierzonej naszej

gorliwości. Trzeba się było zapuścić według mego obliczenia w boczną

uliczkę, minąć dwie albo trzy przecznice, ażeby osiągnąć ulicę nocnych

sklepów. To oddalało mnie od celu, ale można było nadrobić spóźnienie,

wracając drogą na Żupy Solne. Uskrzydlony pragnieniem zwiedzenia sklepów

cynamonowych, skręciłem w wiadomą mi ulicę i leciałem więcej, aniżeli

szedłem, bacząc, by nie zmylić drogi. Tak minąłem już trzecią czy

czwartą przecznicę, a upragnionej ulicy wciąż nie było. W dodatku nawet

konfiguracja ulic nie odpowiadała oczekiwanemu obrazowi. Sklepów ani

śladu. Szedłem ulicą, której domy nie miały nigdzie bramy wchodowej,

tylko okna szczelnie zamknięte, ślepe odblaskiem księżyca. Po drugiej

stronie tych domów musi prowadzić właściwa ulica, od której te domy są

dostępne - myślałem sobie. Z niepokojem przyspieszałem kroku, rezygnując

w duchu z myśli zwiedzenia sklepów. Byle tylko wydostać się stąd prędko

w znane okolice miasta. Zbliżałem się do wylotu, pełen niepokoju, gdzie

też ona mnie wyprowadzi. Wyszedłem na szeroki, rzadko zabudowany

gościniec, bardzo długi i prosty. Owiał mnie od razu oddech szerokiej

przestrzeni. Stały tam przy ulicy albo w głębi ogrodów malownicze wille,

ozdobne budynki bogaczy. W przerwach między nimi widniały parki i mury

sadów. Obraz przypominał z daleka ulicę Leszniańską w jej dolnych i

rzadko zwiedzanych okolicach. Światło księżyca, rozpuszczone w

tysiącznych barankach, w łuskach srebrnych na niebie, było blade i tak

jasne jak w dzień - tylko parki i ogrody czerniały w tym srebrnym

krajobrazie. Przyjrzawszy się bacznie jednemu z budynków, doszedłem do

przekonania, że mam przed sobą tylną i nigdy nie widzianą stronę gmachu

gimnazjalnego. Właśnie dochodziłem do bramy, która ku memu zdziwieniu

była otwarta, sień oświetlona. Wszedłem i znalazłem się na czerwonym

chodniku korytarza. Miałem nadzieję, że zdołam nie spostrzeżony

przekraść się przez budynek i wyjść przednią bramą, skracając sobie

znakomicie drogę. Przypomniałem sobie, że o tej późnej godzinie musi się

w sali profesora Arendta odbywać jedna z lekcyj nadobowiązkowych,

prowadzona w późną noc, na które zbieraliśmy się zimową porą, płonąc

szlachetnym zapałem do ćwiczeń rysunkowych, jakim natchnął nas ten

znakomity nauczyciel. Mała gromadka pilnych gubiła się prawie w wielkiej

ciemnej sali, na której ścianach ogromniały i łamały się cienie naszych

głów, rzucane od dwóch małych świeczek płonących w szyjkach butelek.

Prawdę mówiąc, niewieleśmy podczas tych godzin rysowali i profesor nie

stawiał zbyt ścisłych wymagań. Niektórzy przynosili sobie z domu

poduszki i układali się na ławkach do powierzchownej drzemki. I tylko

najpilniejsi rysowali pod samą świecą, w złotym kręgu jej blasku.

Czekaliśmy zazwyczaj długo na przyjście profesora, nudząc się wśród

sennych rozmów. Wreszcie otwierały się drzwi jego pokoju i wchodził -

mały, z piękną brodą, pełen ezoterycznych uśmiechów, dyskretnych

przemilczeń i aromatu tajemnicy. Szybko zaciskał za sobą drzwi gabinetu,

przez które w momencie otworzenia tłoczyła się za jego głową ciżba

gipsowych cieni, fragmentów klasycznych, bolesnych Niobid, Danaid i

Tantalidów, cały smutny i jałowy Olimp, więdnący od lat w tym muzeum

gipsów. Zmierzch tego pokoju mętniał i za dnia i przelewał się sennie od

gipsowych marzeń, pustych spojrzeń, blednących owali i zamyśleń

odchodzących w nicość. Lubiliśmy nieraz podsłuchiwać pod drzwiami -

ciszy, pełnej westchnień i szeptów tego kruszejącego w pajęczynach

rumowiska, tego rozkładającego się w nudzie i monotonii zmierzchu bogów.

Profesor przechadzał się dostojnie, pełen namaszczenia, wzdłuż pustych

ławek, wśród których rozrzuceni małymi grupkami, rysowaliśmy coś w

szarym odblasku nocy zimowej. Było zacisznie i sennie. Gdzieniegdzie

koledzy moi układali się do snu. Świeczki powoli dogasały w butelkach.

Profesor pogrążał się w głęboką witrynę, pełną starych foliałów,

staromodnych ilustracyj, sztychów i druków. Pokazywał nam wśród

ezoterycznych gestów stare litografie wieczornych pejzaży, gęstwiny

nocne, aleje zimowych parków, czerniejące na białych drogach

księżycowych. Wśród sennych rozmów upływał niespostrzeżenie czas i biegł

nierównomiernie, robiąc niejako węzły w upływie godzin, połykając kędyś

całe puste interwały trwania, Niespostrzeżenie, bez przejścia,

odnajdywaliśmy naszą czeredę już w drodze powrotnej na białej od śniegu

ścieżce szpaleru, flankowanej czarną, suchą gęstwiną krzaków. Szliśmy

wzdłuż tego włochatego brzegu ciemności, ocierając się o niedwiedzie

futro krzaków, trzaskających pod naszymi nogami w jasną noc

bezksiężycową, w mleczny, fałszywy dzień, daleko po północy. Rozprószona

biel tego światła, mżąca ze śniegu, z bladego powietrza, z mlecznych

przestworzy, była jak szary papier sztychu, na którym głęboką czernią

plątały się kreski i szrafirunki gęstych zarośli. Noc powtarzała teraz

głęboko po północy te serie nokturnów, sztychów nocnych profesora

Arendta, kontynuowała jego fantazje. W tej czarnej gęstwinie parku, we

włochatej sierści zarośli, w masie kruchego chrustu były miejscami

nisze, gniazda najgłębszej puszystej czarnoci, pełne plątaniny,

sekretnych gestów, bezładnej rozmowy na migi. Było w tych gniazdach

zacisznie i ciepło. Siadaliśmy tam na letnim miękkim śniegu w naszych

włochatych płaszczach, zajadając orzechy, których pełna była leszczynowa

ta gęstwina w ową wiosenną zimę. Przez zarośla przewijały się bezgłośnie

kuny, łasice i ichneumony, futrzane, węszące zwierzątka, śmierdzące

kożuchem, wydłużone, na niskich łapkach. Podejrzewalimy, że były między

nimi okazy gabinetu szkolnego, które choć wypatroszone i łysiejące,

uczuwały w tę białą noc w swym pustym wnętrzu głos starego instynktu,

głos rui, i wracały do matecznika na krótki, złudny żywot. Ale powoli

fosforescencja wiosennego śniegu mętniała i gasła i nadchodziła czarna i

gęsta oćma przed świtem. Niektórzy z nas zasypiali w ciepłym śniegu,

inni domacywali się w gęstwinie bram swych domów, wchodzili omackiem do

ciemnych wnętrzy, w sen rodziców i braci, w dalszy ciąg głębokiego

chrapania, które doganiali na swych spóźnionych drogach. Te nocne seanse

pełne były dla mnie tajemnego uroku, nie mogłem i teraz pominąć

sposobności, by nie zaglądnąć na moment do sali rysunkowej,

postanawiając, że nie pozwolę się tam zatrzymać dłużej nad krótką

chwilkę. Ale wstępując po tylnych, cedrowych schodach, pełnych

dźwięcznego rezonansu, poznałem, że znajduję się w obcej, nigdy nie

widzianej stronie gmachu. Najlżejszy szmer nie przerywał tu solennej

ciszy. Korytarze były w tym skrzydle obszerniejsze, wysłane pluszowym

dywanem i pełne wytworności. Małe, ciemno płonące lampy świeciły na ich

zagięciach. Minąwszy jedno takie kolano, znalazłem się na korytarzu

jeszcze większym, strojnym w przepych pałacowy. Jedna jego ściana

otwierała się szerokimi, szklanymi arkadami do wnętrza mieszkania.

Zaczynała się tu przed oczyma długa amfilada pokojów, biegnących w głąb

i urządzonych z olśniewającą wspaniałością. Szpalerem obić jedwabnych,

luster złoconych, kosztownych mebli i kryształowych pająków biegł wzrok

w puszysty miąższ tych zbytkownych wnętrzy, pełnych kolorowego wirowania

i migotliwych arabesek, plączących się girland i pączkujących kwiatów.

Głęboka cisza tych pustych salonów pełna była tylko tajnych spojrzeń,

które oddawały sobie zwierciadła, i popłochu arabesek, biegnących wysoko

fryzami wzdłuż ścian i gubiących się w sztukateriach białych sufitów. Z

podziwem i czcią stałem przed tym przepychem, domyślałem się, że nocna

moja eskapada zaprowadziła mnie niespodzianie w skrzydło dyrektora,

przed jego prywatne mieszkanie. Stałem przygwożdżony ciekawością, z

bijącym sercem, gotów do ucieczki za najlżejszym szmerem. Jakże mógłbym,

przyłapany, usprawiedliwić to moje nocne szpiegowanie, moje zuchwałe

wścibstwo? W którym z głębokich pluszowych foteli mogła, nie

dostrzeżona i cicha, siedzieć córeczka dyrektora i podnieść nagle na

mnie oczy znad książki - czarne, sybilińskie, spokojne oczy, których

spojrzenia nikt z nas wytrzymać nie umiał. Ale cofnąć się w połowie

drogi, nie dokonawszy powziętego planu, poczytałbym był sobie za

tchórzostwo. Zresztą głęboka cisza panowała dookoła w pełnych przepychu

wnętrzach, oświetlonych przyćmionym światłem nie określonej pory. Przez

arkady korytarza widziałem na drugim końcu wielkiego salonu duże,

oszklone drzwi, prowadzące na taras. Było tak cicho wokoło, że nabrałem

odwagi. Nie wydawało mi się to połączone ze zbyt wielkim ryzykiem, zejść

z paru stopni, prowadzących do poziomu sali, w kilku susach przebiegnąć

wielki, kosztowny dywan i znaleźć się na tarasie, z którego bez trudu

dostać się mogłem na dobrze mi znaną ulicę. Uczyniłem tak. Zeszedłszy na

parkiety salonu, pod wielkie palmy, wystrzelające tam z wazonów aż do

arabesek sufitu, spostrzegłem, że znajduję się już właściwie na gruncie

neutralnym, gdyż salon nie miał wcale przedniej ściany. Był on rodzajem

wielkiej loggii, łączącej się przy pomocy paru stopni z placem miejskim.

Była to niejako odnoga tego placu i niektóre meble stały już na bruku.

Zbiegłem z kilku kamiennych schodów i znalazłem się znów na ulicy.

Konstelacje stały już stromo na głowie, wszystkie gwiazdy przekręciły

się na drugą stronę, ale księżyc, zagrzebany w pierzyny obłoczków, które

rozświetlał swą niewidzialną obecnością, zdawał się mieć przed sobą

jeszcze nieskończoną drogę i, zatopiony w swych zawiłych procederach

niebieskich, nie myślał o świcie. Na ulicy czerniało kilka dorożek,

rozjechanych i rozklekotanych jak kalekie, drzemiące kraby czy karakony.

Woźnica nachylił się z wysokiego kozła. Miał twarz drobną, czerwoną i

dobroduszną. - Pojedziemy, paniczu? - zapytał. Powóz zadygotał we

wszystkich stawach i przegubach swego wieloczłonkowego ciała i ruszył na

lekkich obręczach. Ale kto w taką noc powierza się kaprysom

nieobliczalnego dorożkarza? Wśród klekotu szprych, wśród dudnienia pudła

i budy nie mogłem porozumieć się z nim co do celu drogi. Kiwał na

wszystko niedbale i pobłażliwie głową i podśpiewywał sobie, jadąc drogą

okrężną przez miasto. Przed jakimś szynkiem stała grupa dorożkarzy,

kiwając nań przyjaźnie rękami. Odpowiedział im coś radośnie, po czym nie

zatrzymując pojazdu, rzucił mi lejce na kolana, spuścił się z kozła i

przyłączył do gromady kolegów. Koń, stary mądry koń dorożkarski,

oglądnął się pobieżnie i pojechał dalej jednostajnym, dorożkarskim

kłusem. Właciwie koń ten budził zaufanie - wydawał się mądrzejszy od

woźnicy. Ale powozić nie umiałem - trzeba się było zdać na jego wolę.

Wjechaliśmy na podmiejską ulicę ujętą z obu stron w ogrody. Ogrody te

przechodziły zwolna, w miarę posuwania się, w parki wielkodrzewne, a te

w lasy. Nie zapomnę nigdy tej jazdy świetlistej w najjaśniejszą noc

zimową. Kolorowa mapa niebios wyogromniała w kopułę niezmierną, na

której spiętrzyły się fantastyczne lądy, oceany i morza, porysowane

liniami wirów i prądów gwiezdnych, świetlistymi liniami geografii

niebieskiej. Powietrze stało się lekkie do oddychania i świetlane jak

gaza srebrna. Pachniało fiołkami. Spod wełnianego jak białe karakuły

śniegu wychylały się anemony drżące, z iskrą światła księżycowego w

delikatnym kielichu. Las cały zdawał się iluminować tysiącznymi

światłami, gwiazdami, które rzęsiście ronił grudniowy firmament.

Powietrze dyszało jaką tajną wiosną, niewypowiedzianą czystością śniegu

i fiołków. Wjechaliśmy w teren pagórkowaty. Linie wzgórzy, włochatych

nagimi rózgami drzew, podnosiły się jak błogie westchnienia w niebo.

Ujrzałem na tych szczęśliwych zboczach całe grupy wędrowców,

zbierających wród mchu i krzaków opadłe i mokre od śniegu gwiazdy.

Droga stała się stroma, koń poślizgiwał się i z trudem ciągnął pojazd,

grający wszystkimi przegubami. Byłem szczęśliwy. Pierś moja wchłaniała

tę błogą wiosnę powietrza, świeżość gwiazd i śniegu. Przed piersią konia

zbierał się wał białej piany śnieżnej, coraz wyższy i wyższy. Z trudem

przekopywał się koń przez czystą i świeżą jego masę. Wreszcie ustał.

Wyszedłem z dorożki. Dyszał ciężko ze zwieszoną głową. Przytuliłem jego

łeb do piersi, w jego wielkich czarnych oczach lśniły łzy. Wtedy

ujrzałem na jego brzuchu okrągłą czarną ranę. - Dlaczego mi nie

powiedziałeś? - szepnąłem ze łzami. - Drogi mój - to dla ciebie - rzekł

i stał się bardzo mały, jak konik z drzewa. Opuściłem go. Czułem się

dziwnie lekki i szczęśliwy. Zastanawiałem się, czy czekać na małą

kolejkę lokalną, która tu zajeżdżała, czy też pieszo wrócić do miasta.

Zacząłem schodzić stromą serpentyną wśród lasu, początkowo idąc krokiem

lekkim, elastycznym, potem, nabierając rozpędu, przeszedłem w posuwisty

szczęśliwy bieg, który zmienił się wnet w jazdę jak na nartach. Mogłem

dowoli regulować szybkość, kierować jazdą przy pomocy lekkich zwrotów

ciała. W pobliżu miasta zahamowałem ten bieg tryumfalny, zmieniając go

na przyzwoity krok spacerowy. Księżyc stał jeszcze ciągle wysoko.

Transformacje nieba, metamorfozy jego wielokrotnych sklepień w coraz to

kunsztowniejsze konfiguracje nie miały końca. Jak srebrne astrolabium

otwierało niebo w tę noc czarodziejską mechanizm wnętrza i ukazywało w

nieskończonych ewolucjach złocistą matematykę swych kół i trybów. Na

rynku spotkałem ludzi zażywających przechadzki. Wszyscy, oczarowani

widowiskiem tej nocy, mieli twarze wzniesione i srebrne od magii nieba.

Troska o portfel opuściła mnie zupełnie. Ojciec, pogrążony w swych

dziwactwach, zapewne zapomniał już o zgubie, o matkę nie dbałem. W taką

noc, jedyną w roku, przychodzą szczęśliwe myśli, natchnienia, wieszcze

tknięcia palca bożego. Pełen pomysłów i inspiracji, chciałem skierować

się do domu, gdy zaszli mi drogę koledzy z książkami pod pachą. Zbyt

wcześnie wyszli do szkoły, obudzeni jasnością tej nocy, która nie

chciała się skończyć. Poszlimy gromadą na spacer stromo spadającą

ulicą, z której wiał powiew fiołków, niepewni, czy to jeszcze magia nocy

srebrzyła się na śniegu, czy też świt już wstawał...



                            ULICA KROKODYLI



 Mój ojciec przechowywał w dolnej szufladzie swego

głębokiego biurka starą i piękną mapę naszego miasta. Był to cały

wolumen in folio pergaminowych kart, które pierwotnie spojone skrawkami

płótna, tworzyły ogromną mapę ścienną w kształcie panoramy z ptasiej

perspektywy. Zawieszona na ścianie, zajmowała niemal przestrzeń całego

pokoju i otwierała daleki widok na całą dolinę Tymienicy, wijącej się

falisto bladozłotą wstęgą, na całe pojezierze szeroko rozlanych moczarów

i stawów, na pofałdowane przedgórza, ciągnące się ku południowi, naprzód

z rzadka, potem coraz tłumniejszymi pasmami, szachownicą okrągławych

wzgórzy, coraz mniejszych i coraz bledszych, w miarę jak odchodziły ku

złotawej i dymnej mgle horyzontu. Z tej zwiędłej dali peryferii

wynurzało się miasto i rosło ku przodowi, naprzód jeszcze w nie

zróżnicowanych kompleksach, w zwartych blokach i masach domów,

poprzecinanych głębokimi parowami ulic, by bliżej jeszcze wyodrębnić się

w pojedyncze kamienice, sztychowane z ostrą wyrazistością widoków

oglądanych przez lunetę. Na tych bliższych planach wydobył sztycharz

cały zawikłany i wieloraki zgiełk ulic i zaułków, ostrą wyrazistość

gzymsów, architrawów, archiwolt i pilastrów, świecących w późnym i

ciemnym złocie pochmurnego popołudnia, które pogrąża wszystkie załomy i

framugi w głębokiej sepii cienia. Bryły i pryzmy tego cienia wcinały

się, jak plastry ciemnego miodu, w wąwozy ulic, zatapiały w swej

ciepłej, soczystej masie tu całą połowę ulicy, tam wyłom między domami,

dramatyzowały i orkiestrowały ponurą romantyką cieni tę wieloraką

polifonię architektoniczną. Na tym planie, wykonanym w stylu barokowych

prospektów, okolica Ulicy Krokodylej świeciła pustą bielą, jaką na

kartach geograficznych zwykło się oznaczać okolice podbiegunowe, krainy

niezbadane i niepewnej egzystencji. Tylko linie kilku ulic wrysowane tam

były czarnymi kreskami i opatrzone nazwami w prostym, nieozdobnym

piśmie, w odróżnieniu od szlachetnej antykwy innych napisów. Widocznie

kartograf wzbraniał się uznać przynależność tej dzielnicy do zespołu

miasta i zastrzeżenie swe wyraził w tym odrębnym i postponującym

wykonaniu. Aby zrozumieć tę rezerwę, musimy już teraz zwrócić uwagę na

dwuznaczny i wątpliwy charakter tej dzielnicy, tak bardzo odbiegający od

zasadniczego tonu całego miasta. Był to dystrykt przemysłowo-handlowy z

podkreślonym jaskrawo charakterem trzeźwej użytkowości. Duch czasu,

mechanizm ekonomiki, nie oszczędził i naszego miasta i zapuścił korzenie

na skrawku jego peryferii, gdzie rozwinął się w pasożytniczą dzielnicę.

Kiedy w starym mieście panował wciąż jeszcze nocny, pokątny handel,

pełen solennej ceremonialności, w tej nowej dzielnicy rozwinęły się od

razu nowoczesne, trzeźwe formy komercjalizmu. Pseudoamerykanizm,

zaszczepiony na starym, zmurszałym gruncie miasta, wystrzelił tu bujną,

lecz pustą i bezbarwną wegetacją tandetnej, lichej pretensjonalności.

Widziało się tam tanie, marnie budowane kamienice o karykaturalnych

fasadach, oblepione monstrualnymi sztukateriami z popękanego gipsu.

Stare, krzywe domki podmiejskie otrzymały szybko sklecone portale, które

dopiero bliższe przyjrzenie demaskowało jako nędzne imitacje

wielkomiejskich urządzeń. Wadliwe, mętne i brudne szyby, łamiące w

falistych refleksach ciemne odbicie ulicy, nie heblowane drzewo portali,

szara atmosfera jałowych tych wnętrzy, osiadających pajęczyną i kłakami

kurzu na wysokich półkach i wzdłuż odartych i kruszących się ścian,

wyciskały tu, na sklepach, piętno dzikiego Klondike'u. Tak ciągnęły się

jeden za drugim, magazyny krawców, konfekcje, składy porcelany,

drogerie, zakłady fryzjerskie. Szare ich, wielkie szyby wystawowe nosiły

ukośnie lub w półkolu biegnące napisy ze złoconych plastycznych liter:

CONFISERIE, MANUCURE, KING OF ENGLAND. Rdzenni mieszkańcy miasta

trzymali się z dala od tej okolicy, zamieszkiwanej przez szumowiny,

przez gmin, przez kreatury bez charakteru, bez gęstości, przez istną

lichotę moralną, tę tandetną odmianę człowieka, która rodzi się w takich

efemerycznych środowiskach. Ale w dniach upadku, w godzinach niskiej

pokusy zdarzało się, że ten lub ów z mieszkańców miasta zabłąkiwał się

na wpół przypadkiem w tę wątpliwą dzielnicę. Najlepsi nie byli czasem

wolni od pokusy dobrowolnej degradacji, zniwelowania granic i

hierarchii, pławienia się w tym płytkim błocie wspólnoty, łatwej

intymności, brudnego zmieszania. Dzielnica ta była eldoradem takich

dezerterów moralnych, takich zbiegów spod sztandaru godności własnej.

Wszystko zdawało się tam podejrzane i dwuznaczne, wszystko zapraszało

sekretnym mrugnięciem, cynicznie artykułowanym gestem, wyraźnie

przymrużonym perskim okiem - do nieczystych nadziei, wszystko wyzwalało

z pęt niską naturę. Mało kto, nie uprzedzony, spostrzegał dziwną

osobliwość tej dzielnicy: brak barw, jak gdyby w tym tandetnym, w

pośpiechu wyrosłym mieście nie można było sobie pozwolić na luksus

kolorów. Wszystko tam było szare jak na jednobarwnych fotografiach, jak

w ilustrowanych prospektach. Podobieństwo to wychodziło poza zwykłą

metaforę, gdyż chwilami, wędrując po tej części miasta, miało się w

istocie wrażenie, że wertuje się w jakimś prospekcie, w nudnych

rubrykach komercjalnych ogłoszeń, wśród których zagniedziły się

pasożytniczo podejrzane anonse, drażliwe notatki, wątpliwe ilustracje; i

wędrówki te były równie jałowe i bez rezultatu jak ekscytacje fantazji,

pędzonej przez szpalty i kolumny pornograficznych druków. Wchodziło się

do jakiegoś krawca, żeby zamówić ubranie - ubranie o taniej elegancji,

tak charakterystycznej dla tej dzielnicy. Lokal był wielki i pusty,

bardzo wysoki i bezbarwny. Ogromne wielopiętrowe półki wznoszą się jedne

nad drugimi w nie określoną wysokość tej hali. Kondygnacje pustych półek

wyprowadzają wzrok w górę aż pod sufit, który może być niebem - lichym,

bezbarwnym, odrapanym niebem tej dzielnicy. Natomiast dalsze magazyny,

które widać przez otwarte drzwi, pełne są aż pod sufit pudeł i kartonów,

piętrzących się ogromną kartoteką, która rozpada się w górze, pod

zagmatwanym niebem strychu w kubaturę pustki, w jałowy budulec nicości.

Przez wielkie szare okna, kratkowane wielokrotnie jak arkusze papieru

kancelaryjnego, nie wchodzi światło, gdyż przestrzeń sklepu już

napełniona jest, jak wodą, indyferentną szarą poświatą, która nie rzuca

cienia i nie akcentuje niczego. Wnet nawija się jakiś smukły

młodzieniec, zadziwiająco usłużny, giętki i nieodporny, ażeby dogodzić

naszym życzeniom i zalać nas tanią i łatwą wymową subiekta. Ale gdy,

gadając, rozwija ogromne postawy sukna, przymierza, fałduje i drapuje

niekończącą się strugę materiału, przepływającą przez jego ręce,

formując z jego fal iluzoryczne surduty i spodnie, cała ta manipulacja

wydaje się czym nieistotnym, pozorem, komedią, ironicznie zarzuconą

zasłoną na prawdziwy sens sprawy. Panienki sklepowe, smukłe i czarne,

każda z jakąś skazą piękności (charakterystyczną dla tej dzielnicy

wybrakowanych artykułów), wchodzą i wychodzą, stają w drzwiach

magazynów, sondując oczyma, czy rzecz wiadoma (powierzona doświadczonym

rękom subiekta) dojrzewa do punktu właściwego. Subiekt przymila się i

kryguje i chwilami robi wrażenie transwestyty. Chciałoby się go ująć pod

miękko zarysowaną brodę lub uszczypnąć w upudrowany blady policzek, gdy

z porozumiewawczym półspojrzeniem dyskretnie zwraca uwagę na markę

ochronną towaru, markę o przejrzystej symbolice. Zwolna sprawa wyboru

ubrania schodzi na plan dalszy. Ten miękki do efeminacji i zepsuty

młodzieniec, pełen zrozumienia dla najintymniejszych poruszeń klienta,

przesuwa teraz przed jego oczyma osobliwe marki ochronne, całą

bibliotekę znaków ochronnych, gabinet kolekcjonerski wyrafinowanego

zbieracza. Pokazywało się wówczas, że magazyn konfekcji był tylko

fasadą, za którą kryła się antykwarnia, zbiór wysoce dwuznacznych

wydawnictw i druków prywatnych. Usłużny subiekt otwiera dalsze składy,

wypełnione aż pod sufit książkami, rycinami, fotografiami. Te winiety,

te ryciny przechodzą stokrotnie najśmielsze nasze marzenia. Takich

kulminacyj zepsucia, takich wymyślności wyuzdania nie przeczuwalimy

nigdy. Panienki sklepowe przesuwają się coraz częściej pomiędzy

szeregami książek, szare i papierowe, ale pełne pigmentu w zepsutych

twarzach, ciemnego pigmentu brunetek o lśniącej i tłustej czarności,

która zaczajona w oczach, z nagła wybiegała z nich zygzakiem lśniącego

karakoniego biegu. Ale i w spalonych rumieńcach, w pikantnych stygmatach

pieprzyków, we wstydliwych znamionach ciemnego puszku zdradzała się rasa

zapiekłej, czarnej krwi. Ten barwik o nazbyt intensywnej mocy, ta mokka

gęsta i aromatyczna zdawała się plamić książki, które brały one do

oliwkowej dłoni, ich dotknięcia zdawały się je farbować i zostawiać w

powietrzu ciemny deszcz piegów, smugę tabaki, jak purchawka o

podniecającej, animalnej woni. Tymczasem powszechna rozwiązłość zrzucała

coraz bardziej hamulce pozorów. Subiekt, wyczerpawszy swą natarczywą

aktywność, przechodził powoli do kobiecej bierności. Leży teraz na

jednej z wielu kanap, porozstawianych wród rejonów książek, w jedwabnej

pidżamie, odsłaniającej kobiecy dekolt. Panienki demonstrują, jedna

przed drugą, figury i pozycje rycin okładkowych, inne zasypiają już na

prowizorycznych posłaniach. Nacisk na klienta rozluźniał się.

Wypuszczano go z kręgu natarczywego zainteresowania, pozostawiano sobie

samemu. Subiektki, zajęte rozmową, nie zwracały nań więcej uwagi.

Odwrócone do niego tyłem lub bokiem, przystawały w aroganckim kontra

poście, przestępowały z nogi na nogę, grając kokieteryjnym obuwiem,

przepuszczały z góry na dół po smukłym ciele wężową grę członków,

atakując nią spoza swej niedbałej nieodpowiedzialności podnieconego

widza, którego ignorowały. Tak cofano się, wsuwano w głąb z

wyrachowaniem, otwierając wolną przestrzeń dla aktywności gościa.

Skorzystajmy z tego momentu nieuwagi, ażeby wymknąć się nieprzewidzianym

konsekwencjom tej niewinnej wizyty i wydostać się na ulicę. Nikt nas nie

zatrzymuje. Przez korytarze książek, pomiędzy długimi regałami czasopism

i druków wydostajemy się ze sklepu i oto jestemy w tym miejscu Ulicy

Krokodylej, gdzie z wyniesionego jej punktu widać niemal całą długość

tego szerokiego traktu aż do dalekich, nie wykończonych zabudowań dworca

kolejowego. Jest to szary dzień, jak zawsze w tej okolicy, i cała

sceneria wydaje się chwilami fotografią z ilustrowanej gazety, tak

szare, tak płaskie są domy, ludzie i pojazdy. Ta rzeczywistość jest

cienka jak papier i wszystkimi szparami zdradza swą imitatywność.

Chwilami ma się wrażenie, że tylko na małym skrawku przed nami układa

się wszystko przykładnie w ten pointowany obraz bulwaru

wielkomiejskiego, gdy tymczasem już na bokach rozwiązuje się i rozprzęga

ta zaimprowizowana maskarada i, niezdolna wytrwać w swej roli, rozpada

się za nami w gips i pakuły, w rupieciarnię jakiegoś ogromnego pustego

teatru. Napięcie pozy, sztuczna powaga maski, ironiczny patos drży na

tym naskórku. Ale dalecy jesteśmy od chęci demaskowania widowiska. Wbrew

lepszej wiedzy czujemy się wciągnięci w tandetny czar dzielnicy. Zresztą

nie brak w obrazie miasta i pewnych cech autoparodii. Rzędy małych,

parterowych domków podmiejskich zmieniają się z wielopiętrowymi

kamienicami, które zbudowane jak z kartonu, są konglomeratem szyldów,

ślepych okien biurowych, szklistoszarych wystaw, reklam i numerów. Pod

domami płynie rzeka tłumu. Ulica jest szeroka jak bulwar wielkomiejski,

ale jezdnia, jak place wiejskie, zrobiona jest z ubitej gliny, pełna

wybojów, kałuży i trawy. Ruch uliczny dzielnicy służy do porównań w tym

mieście, mieszkańcy mówią o nim z dumą i porozumiewawczym błyskiem w

oku. Szary, bezosobisty ten tłum jest nader przejęty swą rolą i pełen

gorliwości w demonstrowaniu wielkomiejskiego pozoru. Wszelako, mimo

zaaferowania i interesowności, ma się wrażenie błędnej, monotonnej,

bezcelowej wędrówki, jakiegoś sennego korowodu marionetek. Atmosfera

dziwnej błahości przenika tę całą scenerię. Tłum płynie monotonnie i,

rzecz dziwna, widzi się go zawsze jakby niewyraźnie, figury przepływają

w splątanym, łagodnym zgiełku, nie dochodząc do zupełnej wyrazistości.

Czasem tylko wyławiamy z tego gwaru wielu głów jakieś ciemne, żywe

spojrzenie, jakiś czarny melonik nasunięty głęboko na głowę, jakieś pół

twarzy rozdarte uśmiechem, z ustami, które właśnie coś powiedziały,

jakąś nogę wysuniętą w kroku i tak już zastygłą na zawsze. Osobliwością

dzielnicy są dorożki bez woźniców, biegnące samopas po ulicach. Nie

jakoby nie było tu dorożkarzy, ale wmieszani w tłum i zajęci tysiącem

spraw, nie troszczą się o swe dorożki. W tej dzielnicy pozoru i pustego

gestu nie przywiązuje się zbytniej wagi do ścisłego celu jazdy i

pasażerowie powierzają się tym błędnym pojazdom z lekkomylnością, która

cechuje tu wszystko. Nieraz można ich widzieć na niebezpiecznych

zakrętach, wychylonych daleko z połamanej budy, jak z lejcami w dłoniach

przeprowadzają z natężeniem trudny manewr wymijania. Mamy w tej

dzielnicy także tramwaje. Ambicja rajców miejskich święci tu najwyższy

swój triumf. Ale pożałowania godny jest widok tych wozów, zrobionych z

papier mâché, o ścianach powyginanych i zmiętych od wieloletniego

użytku. Często brak im zupełnie przedniej ściany tak, że widzieć można w

przejeździe pasażerów, siedzących sztywnie i zachowujących się z wielką

godnością. Tramwaje te popychane są przez tragarzy miejskich.

Najdziwniejszą atoli rzeczą jest komunikacja kolejowa na Ulicy

Krokodylej. Czasami, w nieregularnych porach dnia, gdzieś ku końcowi

tygodnia można zauważyć tłum ludzi czekających na zakręcie ulicy na

pociąg. Nie jest się nigdy pewnym, czy przyjedzie i gdzie stanie, i

zdarza się często, że ludzie ustawiają się w dwóch różnych punktach, nie

mogąc uzgodnić swych poglądów na miejsce przystanku. Czekają długo i

stoją czarnym milczącym tłumem wzdłuż ledwo zarysowanych śladów toru, z

twarzami w profilu, jak szereg bladych masek z papieru, wyciętych w

fantastyczną linię zapatrzenia. I wreszcie niespodzianie zajeżdża, już

wjechał z bocznej uliczki, skąd go oczekiwano, niski jak wąż,

miniaturowy, z małą, sapiącą, krępą lokomotywą. Wjechał w ten czarny

szpaler i ulica staje się ciemna od tego ciągu wozów, siejących pył

węglowy. Ciemne sapanie parowozu i powiew dziwnej powagi, pełnej smutku,

tłumiony pośpiech i zdenerwowanie zamieniają ulicę na chwilę w halę

dworca kolejowego w szybko zapadającym zmierzchu zimowym. Plagą naszego

miasta jest ażiotaż biletów kolejowych i przekupstwo. W ostatniej

chwili, gdy pociąg już stoi na stacji, toczą się w nerwowym pośpiechu

pertraktacje z przekupnymi urzędnikami linii żelaznej. Zanim te

negocjacje się kończą, pociąg rusza, odprowadzany przez wolno sunący,

rozczarowany tłum, który odprowadza go daleko, ażeby się wreszcie

rozproszyć. Ulica, zacieśniona na chwilę do tego zaimprowizowanego

dworca, pełnego zmierzchu i tchnienia dalekich dróg - rozwidnia się

znowu, rozszerza i przepuszcza znów swym korytem beztroski monotonny

tłum spacerowiczów, który wędruje wśród gwaru rozmów wzdłuż wystaw

sklepowych, tych brudnych, szarych czworoboków, pełnych tandetnych

towarów, wielkich woskowych manekinów i lalek fryzjerskich. Wyzywająco

ubrane, w długich koronkowych sukniach przechodzą prostytutki. Mogą to

być zresztą żony fryzjerów lub kapelmistrzów kawiarnianych. Idą

drapieżnym, posuwistym krokiem i mają w niedobrych, zepsutych twarzach

nieznaczną skazę, która je przekreśla: zezują czarnym, krzywym zezem lub

mają usta rozdarte, lub brak im koniuszka nosa. Mieszkańcy miasta dumni

są z tego odoru zepsucia, którym tchnie Ulica Krokodyli. Nie mamy

potrzeby niczego sobie odmawiać - myślą z dumą - stać nas i na prawdziwą

wielkomiejską rozpustę. Twierdzą oni, że każda kobieta w tej dzielnicy

jest kokotą. W istocie wystarczy zwrócić uwagę na którą - a natychmiast

spotyka się to uporczywe, lepkie spojrzenie, które nas zmraża rozkoszną

pewnością. Nawet dziewczęta szkolne noszą tu w pewien charakterystyczny

sposób kokardy, stawiają swoistą manierą smukłe nogi i mają tę nieczystą

skazę w spojrzeniu, w której leży preformowane przyszłe zepsucie. A

jednak - a jednak czy mamy zdradzić ostatnią tajemnicę tej dzielnicy,

troskliwie ukrywany sekret Ulicy Krokodyli? Kilkakrotnie w trakcie

naszego sprawozdania stawialiśmy pewne znaki ostrzegawcze, dawaliśmy w

delikatny sposób wyraz naszym zastrzeżeniom. Uważny czytelnik nie będzie

nie przygotowany na ten ostateczny obrót sprawy. Mówilimy o

imitatywnym, iluzorycznym charakterze tej dzielnicy, ale słowa te mają

zbyt ostateczne i stanowcze znaczenie, by określić połowiczny i

niezdecydowany charakter jej rzeczywistości. Język nasz nie posiada

określeń, które by dozowały niejako stopień realności, definiowały jej

giętkość. Powiedzmy bez ogródek: fatalnością tej dzielnicy jest, że nic

w niej nie dochodzi do skutku, nic nie odbiega od swego definitivum,

wszystkie ruchy rozpoczęte zawisają w powietrzu, wszystkie gesty

wyczerpują się przedwcześnie i nie mogą przekroczyć pewnego martwego

punktu. Moglimy już zauważyć wielką bujność i rozrzutność - w

intencjach, w projektach i antycypacjach, która cechuje tę dzielnicę.

Cała ona nie jest niczym innym jak fermentacją pragnień, przedwcześnie

wybujałą i dlatego bezsilną i pustą. W atmosferze nadmiernej łatwości

kiełkuje tutaj każda najlżejsza zachcianka, przelotne napięcie puchnie i

rośnie w pustą, wydętą narośl, wystrzela szara i lekka wegetacja

puszystych chwastów, bezbarwnych włochatych maków, zrobiona z nieważkiej

tkanki majaku i haszyszu. Nad całą dzielnicą unosi się leniwy i

rozwiązły fluid grzechu i domy, sklepy, ludzie wydają się niekiedy

dreszczem na jej gorączkującym ciele, gęsią skórką na jej febrycznych

marzeniach. Nigdzie, jak tu, nie czujemy się tak zagrożeni

możliwościami, wstrząśnięci bliskością spełnienia, pobladli i bezwładni

rozkosznym truchleniem ziszczenia. Lecz na tym się też kończy.

Przekroczywszy pewien punkt napięcia, przypływ zatrzymuje się i cofa,

atmosfera gaśnie i przekwita, możliwości więdną i rozpadają się w

nicość, oszalałe szare maki ekscytacji rozsypują się w popiół. Będziemy

wiecznie żałowali, żeśmy wtedy wyszli na chwilę z magazynu konfekcji

podejrzanej konduity. Nigdy nie trafimy już doń z powrotem. Będziemy

błądzili od szyldu do szyldu i mylili się setki razy. Zwiedzimy

dziesiątki magazynów, trafimy do całkiem podobnych, będziemy wędrowali

przez szpalery książek, wertowali czasopisma i druki, konferowali długo

i zawile z panienkami o nadmiernym pigmencie i skażonej pięknoci, które

nie potrafią zrozumieć naszych życzeń. Będziemy się wikłali w

nieporozumieniach, aż cała nasza gorączka i podniecenie ulotni się w

niepotrzebnym wysiłku, w straconej na próżno gonitwie. Nasze nadzieje

były nieporozumieniem, dwuznaczny wygląd lokalu i służby - pozorem,

konfekcja była prawdziwą konfekcją, a subiekt nie miał żadnych ukrytych

intencyj. Świat kobiecy Ulicy Krokodylej odznacza się całkiem miernym

zepsuciem, zagłuszonym grubymi warstwami przesądów moralnych i banalnej

pospolitości. W tym mieście taniego materiału ludzkiego brak także

wybujałości instynktu, brak niezwykłych i ciemnych namiętności. Ulica

Krokodyli była koncesją naszego miasta na rzecz nowoczesności i zepsucia

wielkomiejskiego. Widocznie nie stać nas było na nic innego jak na

papierową imitację, jak na fotomontaż złożony z wycinków zleżałych,

zeszłorocznych gazet.



                                  KARAKONY



 Było to w okresie szarych dni, które nastąpiły po świetnej

kolorowości genialnej epoki mego ojca. Były to długie tygodnie depresji,

ciężkie tygodnie bez niedziel i świąt, przy zamkniętym niebie i w

zubożałym krajobrazie. Ojca już wówczas nie było. Górne pokoje

wysprzątano i wynajęto pewnej telefonistce. Z całego ptasiego

gospodarstwa pozostał nam jedyny egzemplarz, wypchany kondor, stojący na

półce w salonie. W chłodnym półmroku zamkniętych firanek stał on tam,

jak za życia, na jednej nodze, w pozie buddyjskiego mędrca, a gorzka

jego, wyschła twarz ascety skamieniała w wyraz ostatecznej obojętności i

abnegacji. Oczy wypadły, a przez wypłakane, łzawe orbity sypały się

trociny. Tylko rogowate egipskie narośle na nagim potężnym dziobie i na

łysej szyi, narośle i gruzły spłowiałobłękitnej barwy nadawały tej

starczej głowie coś dostojnie hieratycznego. Pierzasty habit jego był

już w wielu miejscach przeżarty przez mole i gubił miękkie, szare

pierze, które Adela raz w tygodniu wymiatała wraz z bezimiennym kurzem

pokoju. W wyłysiałych miejscach widać było workowe, grube płótno, z

którego wyłaziły kłaki konopne. Miałem ukryty żal do matki za łatwość, z

jaką przeszła do porządku dziennego nad stratą ojca. Nigdy go nie

kochała - myślałem - a ponieważ ojciec nie był zakorzeniony w sercu

żadnej kobiety, przeto nie mógł też wróść w żadną realność i unosił się

wiecznie na peryferii życia, w półrealnych regionach, na krawędziach

rzeczywistości. Nawet na uczciwą obywatelską śmierć nie zasłużył sobie -

myślałem - wszystko u niego musiało być dziwaczne i wątpliwe.

Postanowiłem w stosownej chwili zaskoczyć matkę otwartą rozmową. Owego

dnia (był ciężki dzień zimowy i od rana już sypał się miękki puch

zmierzchu) matka miała migrenę i leżała na sofie samotnie w salonie. W

tym rzadko odwiedzanym, paradnym pokoju panował od czasu zniknięcia ojca

wzorowy porządek, pielęgnowany woskiem i szczotkami przez Adelę. Meble

przykryte były pokrowcami; wszystkie sprzęty poddały się żelaznej

dyscyplinie, jaką Adela roztoczyła nad tym pokojem. Tylko pęk piór

pawich, stojących w wazie na komodzie, nie dał się utrzymać w ryzach.

Był to element swawolny, niebezpieczny, o nieuchwytnej rewolucyjności,

jak rozhukana klasa gimnazjastek, pełna dewocji w oczy, a rozpustnej

swawoli poza oczyma. Świdrowały te oczy dzień cały i wierciły dziury w

ścianach, mrugały, tłoczyły się, trzepocąc rzęsami, z palcem przy

ustach, jedne przez drugie, pełne chichotu i psoty. Napełniały pokój

świergotem i szeptem, rozsypywały się, jak motyle, dookoła

wieloramiennej lampy, uderzały tłumem barwnym w matowe, starcze dziurki

od kluczy. Nawet w obecności matki, leżącej z zawiązaną głową na sofie,

nie mogły się powstrzymać, robiły perskie oczko, dawały sobie znaki,

mówiły niemym, kolorowym alfabetem, pełnym sekretnych znaczeń. Irytowało

mnie to szydercze porozumienie, ta migotliwa zmowa poza mymi plecami. Z

kolanami przyciśniętymi do sofy matki, badając dwoma palcami, jakby w

zamyśleniu, delikatną materię jej szlafroka, rzekłem niby mimochodem: -

Chciałem cię już od dawna zapytać: prawda, że to jest on? - I chociaż

nie wskazałem nawet spojrzeniem na kondora, matka odgadła od razu,

zmieszała się bardzo i spuściła oczy. Dałem umyślnie upłynąć chwili,

żeby wykosztować jej zmieszanie, po czym z całym spokojem, opanowując

wzbierający gniew, spytałem: - Jaki sens mają w takim razie te wszystkie

plotki i kłamstwa, które rozsiewasz o ojcu? Lecz jej rysy, które w

pierwszej chwili rozpadły się były w panice, zaczęły się znowu

porządkować. - Jakie kłamstwa? - spytała mrugając oczyma, które były

puste, nalane ciemnym błękitem, bez białka. - Znam je od Adeli - rzekłem

- ale wiem, że pochodzą od ciebie; chcę wiedzieć prawdę. Usta jej drżały

lekko, źrenice, unikając mego wzroku, powędrowały w kąt oka. - Nie

kłamałam - rzekła, a usta - jej napęczniały i stały się małe zarazem.

Uczułem, że mnie kokietuje jak kobieta mężczyznę. - Z tymi karakonami to

prawda - sam przecież pamiętasz... - Zmieszałem się. Pamiętałem w

istocie tę inwazję karakonów, ten zalew czarnego rojowiska, które

napełniało ciemność nocną, pajęczą bieganiną. Wszystkie szpary pełne

były drgających wąsów, każda szczelina mogła wystrzelić z nagła

karakonem, z każdego pęknięcia podłogi mogła zlęgnąć się ta czarna

błyskawica, lecąca oszalałym zygzakiem po podłodze. Ach, ten dziki obłęd

popłochu, pisany błyszczącą, czarną linią na tablicy podłogi. Ach, te

krzyki grozy ojca, skaczącego z krzesła na krzesło z dzirytem w ręku.

Nie przyjmując jadła ani napoju, z wypiekami gorączki na twarzy, z

konwulsją wstrętu wrytą dookoła ust, ojciec mój zdziczał zupełnie. Jasne

było, że tego napięcia nienawiści żaden organizm długo wytrzymać nie

może. Straszliwa odraza zamieniała jego twarz w stężałą maskę tragiczną,

w której tylko źrenice, ukryte za dolną powieką, leżały na czatach,

napięte jak cięciwy, w wiecznej podejrzliwości. Z dzikim wrzaskiem

zrywał się nagle z siedzenia, leciał na oślep w kąt pokoju i już

podnosił dziryt, na którym utkwiony ogromny karakon przebierał

rozpaczliwie gmatwaniną swych nóg. Adela przychodziła wówczas blademu ze

zgrozy z pomocą i odbierała lancę wraz z utkwionym trofeum, ażeby ją

utopić w cebrzyku. Już wówczas jednak nie umiałbym był powiedzieć, czy

obrazy te zaszczepiły mi opowiadania Adeli, czy też sam byłem ich

świadkiem. Ojciec mój nie posiadał już wtedy tej siły odpornej, która

zdrowych ludzi broni od fascynacji wstrętu. Zamiast odgraniczyć się do

straszliwej siły atrakcyjnej tej fascynacji, ojciec mój, wydany na łup

szału, wplątywał się w nią coraz bardziej. Smutne skutki nie dały długo

na siebie czekać. Wnet pojawiły się pierwsze podejrzane znaki, które

napełniły nas przerażeniem i smutkiem. Zachowanie ojca zmieniło się.

Szał jego, euforia jego podniecenia przygasła. W ruchach i mimice jęły

się zdradzać znaki złego sumienia. Zaczął nas unikać. Krył się dzień

cały po kątach, w szafach, pod pierzyną... Widziałem go nieraz, jak w

zamyśleniu oglądał własne ręce, badał konsystencję skóry, paznokci, na

których występować zaczęły czarne plamy, jak łuski karakona. W dzień

opierał się jeszcze ostatkami sił, walczył, ale w nocy fascynacja

uderzała nań potężnymi arakami. Widziałem go późną nocą, w świetle

świecy stojącej na podłodze. Mój ojciec leżał na ziemi nagi, popstrzony

czarnymi plamami totemu, pokreślony liniami żeber, fantastycznym

rysunkiem przeświecającej na zewnątrz anatomii, leżał na czworakach,

opętany fascynacją awersji, która go wciągała w głąb swych zawiłych

dróg. Mój ojciec poruszał się wieloczłonkowym, skomplikowanym ruchem

dziwnego rytuału, w którym ze zgrozą poznałem imitację ceremoniału

karakoniego. Od tego czasu wyrzekliśmy się ojca. Podobieństwo do

karakona występowało z dniem każdym wyraźniej - mój ojciec zamieniał się

w karakona. Zaczęliśmy się przyzwyczajać do tego. Widywaliśmy go coraz

rzadziej, całymi tygodniami znikał gdzieś na swych karakonich drogach -

przestaliśmy go odróżniać, zlał się w zupełności z tym czarnym

niesamowitym plemieniem. Kto mógł powiedzieć, czy żył gdzie jeszcze w

jakiej szparze podłogi, czy przebiegał nocami pokoje, zaplątany w afery

karakonie, czy też był może między tymi martwymi owadami, które Adela co

rana znajdowała brzuchem do góry leżące i najeżone nogami i które ze

wstrętem brała na śmietniczkę i wyrzucała? - A jednak - powiedziałem

zdetonowany - jestem pewny, że ten kondor to on. - Matka spojrzała na

mnie spod rzęs: - Nie dręcz mnie, drogi - mówiłam ci już przecież, że

ojciec podróżuje jako komiwojażer po kraju - przecież wiesz, że czasem w

nocy przyjeżdża do domu, ażeby przed świtem jeszcze dalej odjechać.



                                    WICHURA



 Tej długiej i pustej zimy obrodziła ciemność w naszym mieście

ogromnym, stokrotnym urodzajem. Zbyt długo snadź nie sprzątano na

strychach i w rupieciarniach, stłaczano garnki na garnkach i flaszki na

flaszkach, pozwalano narastać bez końca pustym bateriom butelek. Tam, w

tych spalonych, wielkobelkowych lasach strychów i dachów ciemność

zaczęła się wyradzać i dziko fermentować. Tam zaczęły się te czarne

sejmy garnków, te wiecowania gadatliwe i puste, te bełkotliwe

flaszkowania, bulgoty butli i baniek. Aż pewnej nocy wezbrały pod

gontowymi przestworami falangi garnków i flaszek i popłynęły wielkim

stłoczonym ludem na miasto. Strychy, wystrychnięte ze strychów,

rozprzestrzeniały się jedne z drugich i wystrzelały czarnymi szpalerami,

a przez przestronne ich echa przebiegały kawalkady tramów i belek,

lansady drewnianych kozłów, klękających na jodłowe kolana, ażeby

wypadłszy na wolność, napełnić przestwory nocy galopem krokwi i

zgiełkiem płatwi i bantów. Wtedy to wylały się te czarne rzeki, wędrówki

beczek i konwi, i płynęły przez noce. Czarne ich, połyskliwe, gwarne

zbiegowiska oblegały miasto. Nocami mrowił się ten ciemny zgiełk naczyń

i napierał jak armie rozgadanych ryb, niepowstrzymany najazd pyskujących

skopców i bredzących cebrów. Dudniąc dnami, piętrzyły się wiadra, beczki

i konwie, dyndały się gliniane stągwie zdunów, stare kapeluchy i

cylindry dandysów gramoliły się jedna na drugie, rosnąc w niebo

kolumnami, które się rozpadały. I wszystkie kołatały niezgrabnie kołkami

drewnianych języków, mełły nieudolnie w drewnianych gębach bełkot klątw

i obelg, bluźniąc błotem na całej przestrzeni nocy. Aż dobluźniły się,

doklęły swego. Przywołane rechotem naczyń, rozplotkowanym od brzegu do

brzegu, nadeszły wreszcie karawany, nadciągnęły potężne tabory wichru i

stanęły nad nocą. Ogromne obozowisko, czarny ruchomy amfiteatr zstępować

zaczął w potężnych kręgach ku miastu. I wybuchła ciemność ogromną

wzburzoną wichurą i szalała przez trzy dni i trzy noce... - Nie

pójdziesz dziś do szkoły - rzekła rano matka - jest straszna wichura na

dworze. - W pokoju unosił się delikatny welon dymu, pachnący żywicą. Piec

wył i gwizdał, jak gdyby uwiązana w nim była cała sfora psów czy

demonów. Wielki bohomaz, wymalowany na jego pękatym brzuchu, wykrzywiał

się kolorowym grymasem i fantastyczniał wzdętymi policzkami. Pobiegłem

boso do okna. Niebo wydmuchane było wzdłuż i wszerz wiatrami.

Srebrzystobiałe i przestronne, porysowane było w linie sił, natężone do

pęknięcia, w srogie bruzdy, jakby zastygłe żyły cyny i ołowiu.

Podzielone na pola energetyczne i drżące od napięć, pełne było utajonej

dynamiki. Rysowały się w nim diagramy wichury, która sama niewidoczna i

nieuchwytna, ładowała krajobraz potęgą. Nie widziało się jej. Poznawało

się ją po domach, po dachach, w które wjeżdżała jej furia. Jeden po

drugim strychy zdawały się rosnąć i wybuchać szaleństwem, gdy wstępowała

w nie jej siła. Ogałacała place, zostawiała za sobą na ulicach białą

pustkę, zamiatała całe połacie rynku do czysta. Ledwie tu i ówdzie giął

się pod nią i trzepotał, uczepiony węgła domu, samotny człowiek. Cały

plac rynkowy zdawał się wybrzuszać i lśnić pustą łysiną pod jej

potężnymi przelotami. Na niebie wydmuchał wiatr zimne i martwe kolory,

grynszpanowe, żółte i liliowe smugi, dalekie sklepienia i arkady swego

labiryntu. Dachy stały pod tymi niebami czarne i krzywe, pełne

niecierpliwości i oczekiwania. Te, w które wstąpił wicher, wstawały w

natchnieniu, przerastały sąsiednie domy i prorokowały pod rozwichrzonym

niebem. Potem opadały i gasły nie mogąc dłużej zatrzymać potężnego tchu,

który leciał dalej i napełniał cały przestwór zgiełkiem i przerażeniem.

I znów inne domy wstawały z krzykiem, w paroksyzmie jasnowidzenia, i

zwiastowały. Ogromne buki koło kościoła stały z wniesionymi rękami, jak

świadkowie wstrząsających objawień, i krzyczały, krzyczały. Dalej, za

dachami rynku, widziałem dalekie mury ogniowe, nagie ściany szczytowe

przedmieścia. Wspinały się jeden nad drugi i rosły, zesztywniałe z

przerażenia i osłupiałe. Daleki, zimny, czerwony odblask zabarwiał je

późnymi kolorami. Nie jedliśmy tego dnia obiadu, bo ogień w kuchni

wracał kłębami dymu do izby. W pokojach było zimno i pachniało wiatrem.

Około drugiej po południu wybuchł na przedmieściu pożar i rozszerzał się

gwałtownie. Matka z Adelą zaczęły pakować pościel, futra i kosztowności.

Nadeszła noc. Wicher wzmógł się na sile i gwałtowności, rozrósł się

niepomiernie i objął cały przestwór. Już teraz nie nawiedzał domów i

dachów, ale wybudował nad miastem wielopiętrowy, wielokrotny przestwór,

czarny labirynt, rosnący w nieskończonych kondygnacjach. Z tego

labiryntu wystrzelał całymi galeriami pokojów, wyprowadzał piorunem

skrzydła i trakty, toczył z hukiem długie amfilady, a potem dawał się

zapadać tym wyimaginowanym piętrom, sklepieniom i kazamatom i wzbijał

się jeszcze wyżej, kształtując sam bezforemny bezmiar swym natchnieniem.

Pokój drżał z lekka, obrazy na ścianach brzęczały. Szyby lśniły się

tłustym odblaskiem lampy. Firanki na oknie wisiały wzdęte i pełne

tchnienia tej burzliwej nocy. Przypomnieliśmy sobie, że ojca od rana nie

widziano. Wczesnym rankiem, domyślaliśmy się, musiał udać się do sklepu,

gdzie go zaskoczyła wichura, odcinając mu powrót. - Cały dzień nic nie

jadł - biadała matka. Starszy subiekt Teodor podjął się wyprawić w noc i

wichurę, żeby zanieść mu posiłek. Brat mój przyłączył się do wyprawy.

Okutani w wielkie niedwiedzie futra, obciążyli kieszenie żelazkami i

moździerzami, balastem, który miał zapobiec porwaniu ich przez wichurę.

Ostrożnie otworzono drzwi prowadzące w noc. Zaledwie subiekt i brat mój

z wzdętymi płaszczami wkroczyli jedną nogą w ciemność, noc ich połknęła

zaraz na progu domu. Wicher zmył momentalnie ślad ich wyjścia. Nie widać

było przez okno nawet latarki, którą ze sobą zabrali. Pochłonąwszy ich,

wicher na chwilę przycichł. Adela z matką próbowały na nowo rozpalić

ogień pod kuchnią. Zapałki gasły, przez drzwiczki dmuchało popiołem i

sadzą. Staliśmy pod drzwiami i nasłuchiwali. W lamentach wichru dawały

się słyszeć wszelkie głosy, perswazje, nawoływania i gawędy. Zdawało się

nam, że słyszymy wołanie o pomoc ojca zabłąkanego w wichurze, to znowu,

że brat z Teodorem gwarzą beztrosko pod drzwiami. Wrażenie było tak

łudzące, że Adela otworzyła drzwi i w samej rzeczy ujrzała Teodora i

brata mego, wynurzających się z trudem z wichury, w której tkwili po

pachy. Weszli zdyszani do sieni, zaciskając z wysiłkiem drzwi za sobą.

Przez chwilę musieli wesprzeć się o odrzwia, tak silnie szturmował

wicher do bramy. Wreszcie zasunęli rygiel i wiatr pognał dalej.

Opowiadali bezładnie o nocy, o wichurze. Ich futra, nasiąkłe wiatrem,

pachniały teraz powietrzem. Trzepotali powiekami w świetle; ich oczy,

pełne jeszcze nocy, broczyły ciemnością za każdym uderzeniem powiek. Nie

mogli dojść do sklepu, zgubili drogę i ledwo trafili z powrotem. Nie

poznawali miasta, wszystkie ulice były jak przestawione. Matka

podejrzewała, że kłamali. W istocie cała ta scena sprawiała wrażenie,

jakby przez ten kwadrans stali w ciemności pod oknem, nie oddalając się

wcale. A może naprawdę nie było już miasta i rynku, a wicher i noc

otaczały nasz dom tylko ciemnymi kulisami, pełnymi wycia, świstu i

jęków. Może nie było wcale tych ogromnych i żałosnych przestrzeni, które

nam wicher sugerował, może nie było wcale tych opłakanych labiryntów,

tych wielookiennych traktów i korytarzy, na których grał wicher, jak na

długich czarnych fletach. Coraz bardziej umacniało się w nas

przekonanie, że cała ta burza była tylko donkiszoterią nocną, imitującą

na wąskiej przestrzeni kulis tragiczne bezmiary, kosmiczną bezdomność i

sieroctwo wichury. Coraz częściej otwierały się teraz drzwi sieni i

wpuszczały okutanego w opończe i szale gościa. Zziajany sąsiad lub

znajomy wywijał się powoli z chustek, płaszczy i wyrzucał z siebie

zdyszanym głosem opowiadania, urywane bezładne słowa, które

fantastycznie powiększały, kłamliwie przesadzały bezmiar nocy.

Siedzieliśmy wszyscy w jasno oświetlonej kuchni. Za ogniskiem kuchennym

i czarnym, szerokim okapem komina prowadziło parę stopni do drzwi

strychu. Na tych schodkach siedział starszy subiekt Teodor i

nasłuchiwał, jak strych grał od wichru. Słyszał, jak w pauzach wichury

miechy żeber strychowych składały się w fałdy i dach wiotczał i zwisał

jak ogromne płuca, z których uciekł oddech, to znowu nabierał tchu,

nastawiał się palisadami krokwi, rósł jak sklepienia gotyckie,

rozprzestrzeniał się lasem belek, pełnym stokrotnego echa, i huczał jak

pudło ogromnych basów. Ale potem zapominaliśmy o wichurze, Adela tłukła

cynamon w dźwięcznym moździerzu. Ciotka Perazja przyszła w odwiedziny.

Drobna, ruchliwa i pełna zabiegliwości, z koronką czarnego szala na

głowie, zaczęła krzątać się po kuchni, pomagając Adeli. Adela oskubała

koguta. Ciotka Perazja zapaliła pod okapem komina garść papierów i

szerokie płaty płomienia wzlatywały z nich w czarną czeluść. Adela,

trzymając koguta za szyję, uniosła go nad płomień, ażeby opalić na nim

resztę pierza. Kogut zatrzepotał nagle w ogniu skrzydłami, zapiał i

spłonął. Wtedy ciotka Perazja zaczęła się kłócić, kląć i złorzeczyć.

Trzęsąc się ze złości, wygrażała rękami Adeli i matce. Nie rozumiałem, o

co jej chodzi, a ona zacietrzewiała się coraz bardziej w gniewie i stała

się jednym pękiem gestykulacji i złorzeczeń. Zdawało się, że w

paroksyzmie złości rozgestykuluje się na części, że rozpadnie się,

podzieli, rozbiegnie w sto pająków, rozgałęzi się po podłodze czarnym,

migotliwym pękiem oszalałych karakonach biegów. Zamiast tego zaczęła

raptownie maleć, kurczyć się, wciąż roztrzęsiona i rozsypująca się

przekleństwami. Z nagła podreptała, zgarbiona i mała, w kąt kuchni,

gdzie leżały drwa na opał i, klnąc i kaszląc, zaczęła gorączkowo

przebierać wśród dźwięcznych drewien, aż znalazła dwie cienkie, żółte

drzazgi. Pochwyciła je latającymi ze wzburzenia rękami, przymierzyła do

nóg, po czym wspięła się na nie, jak na szczudła, i zaczęła na tych

żółtych kulach chodzić, stukocąc po deskach, biegać tam i z powrotem

wzdłuż skośnej linii podłogi, coraz szybciej i szybciej, potem wbiegła

na ławkę jodłową, kutykając na dudniących deskach, a stamtąd na półkę z

talerzami, dźwięczną, drewnianą półkę obiegającą ściany kuchni, i biegła

po niej, kolankując na szczudłowych kulach, by wreszcie gdzieś w kącie,

malejąc coraz bardziej, sczernieć, zwinąć się jak zwiędły, spalony

papier, zetlić się w płatek popiołu, skruszyć w proch i w nicość.

Staliśmy wszyscy bezradni wobec tej szalejącej furii złości, która sama

siebie trawiła i pożerała. Z ubolewaniem patrzyliśmy na smutny przebieg

tego paroksyzmu i z pewną ulgą wróciliśmy do naszych zajęć, gdy żałosny

ten proces dobiegł swego naturalnego końca. Adela zadzwoniła znowu

moździerzem, tłukąc cynamon, matka ciągnęła dalej przerwaną rozmowę, a

subiekt Teodor, nasłuchując proroctw strychowych, stroił śmieszne

grymasy, podnosił wysoko brwi i śmiał się do siebie.



NOC WIELKIEGO SEZONU



 Każdy wie, że w szeregu zwykłych, normalnych lat

rodzi niekiedy zdziwaczały czas ze swego łona lata inne, lata osobliwe,

lata wyrodne, którym - jak szósty, mały palec u ręki- -wyrasta kędy

trzynasty, fałszywy miesiąc. Mówimy fałszywy, gdyż rzadko dochodzi on do

pełnego rozwoju. Jak dzieci późno spłodzone, pozostaje on w tyle ze

wzrostem, miesiąc garbusek, odrośl w połowie uwiędła i raczej domyślna

niż rzeczywista. Winna jest temu starcza niepowściągliwość lata, jego

rozpustna i późna żywotność. Bywa czasem, że sierpień minie, a stary

gruby pień lata rodzi z przyzwyczajenia jeszcze dalej, pędzi ze swego

próchna te dni-dziczki, dni-chwasty, jałowe i idiotyczne, dorzuca na

dokładkę, za darmo, dni-kaczany, puste i niejadalne - dni białe,

zdziwione i niepotrzebne. Wyrastają one, nieregularne i nierówne, nie

wykształcone i zrośnięte z sobą, jak palce potworkowatej ręki,

pączkujące i zwinięte w figę. Inni porównywają te dni do apokryfów,

wsuniętych potajemnie między rozdziały wielkiej księgi roku, do

palimpsestów, skrycie włączonych pomiędzy jej stronice, albo do tych

białych nie zadrukowanych kartek, na których oczy, naczytane do syta i

pełne treści, broczyć mogą obrazami i gubić kolory na tych pustych

stronicach, coraz bladziej i bladziej, ażeby wypocząć na ich nicości,

zanim wciągnięte zostaną w labirynty nowych przygód i rozdziałów. Ach,

ten stary, pożółkły romans roku, ta wielka, rozpadająca się księga

kalendarza! Leży ona sobie zapomniana gdzie w archiwach czasu, a treść

jej rośnie dalej między okładkami, pęcznieje bez ustanku od gadulstwa

miesięcy, od szybkiego samorództwa blagi, od bajania i marzeń, które się

w niej mnożą. Ach, i spisując te nasze opowiadania, szeregując te

historie o moim ojcu na zużytym marginesie jej tekstu, czy nie oddaję

się tajnej nadziei, że wrosną one kiedy niepostrzeżenie między zżółkłe

kartki tej najwspanialszej, rozsypującej się księgi, że wejdą w wielki

szelest jej stronic, który je pochłonie? To, o czym tu mówić będziemy,

działo się tedy w owym trzynastym, nadliczbowym i niejako fałszywym

miesiącu tego roku, na tych kilkunastu pustych kartkach wielkiej kroniki

kalendarza. Ranki były podówczas dziwnie cierpkie i orzeźwiające. Po

uspokojonym i chłodniejszym tempie czasu, po nowym całkiem zapachu

powietrza, po odmiennej konsystencji światła poznać było, że weszło się

w inną serię dni, w nową okolicę Bożego Roku. Głos drżał pod tymi nowymi

niebami dźwięcznie i świeżo jak w nowym jeszcze i pustym mieszkaniu,

pełnym zapachu lakieru, farb, rzeczy zaczętych i nie wypróbowanych. Z

dziwnym wzruszeniem próbowało się nowego echa, napoczynało się je z

ciekawością, jak w chłodny i trzeźwy poranek babkę do kawy w przeddzień

podróży. Ojciec mój siedział znowu w tylnym kontuarze sklepu, w małej,

sklepionej izbie, pokratkowanej jak ul w wielokomórkowe registratury i

łuszczącej się bez końca warstwami papieru, listów i faktur. Z szelestu

arkuszy, z nieskończonego kartkowania papierów wyrastała kratkowana i

pusta egzystencja tego pokoju, z nieustannego przekładania plików

odnawiała się w powietrzu z niezliczonych nagłówków firmowych apoteoza w

formie miasta fabrycznego, widzianego z lotu ptaka, najeżonego dymiącymi

kominami, otoczonego rzędami medali i ujętego w wywijasy i zakręty

pompatycznych et i Comp. Tam siedział ojciec, jak w ptaszarni, na

wysokim stołku, a gołębniki registratur szeleściły plikami papierów i

wszystkie gniazda i dziuple pełne były świergotu cyfr. Głąb wielkiego

sklepu ciemniała i wzbogacała się z dnia na dzień zapasami sukna,

szewiotów, aksamitów i kortów. W ciemnych półkach, tych spichrzach i

lamusach chłodnej, pilśniowej barwności, procentowała stokrotnie ciemna,

odstała korowość rzeczy, mnożył się i sycił potężny kapitał jesieni. Tam

rósł i ciemniał ten kapitał i rozsiadał się coraz szerzej na półkach,

jak na galeriach jakiego wielkiego teatru, uzupełniając się jeszcze i

pomnażając każdego rana nowymi ładunkami towaru, który w skrzyniach i

pakach wraz z rannym chłodem wnosili na niedwiedzich barach stękający,

brodaci tragarze w oparach świeżości jesiennej i wódki. Subiekci

wyładowywali te nowe zapasy sycących bławatnych kolorów i wypełniali

nimi, kitowali starannie wszystkie szpary i luki wysokich szaf. Był to

rejestr olbrzymi wszelakich kolorów jesieni, ułożony warstwami,

usortowany odcieniami, idący w dół i w górę, jak po dźwięcznych

schodach, po gamach wszystkich oktaw barwnych. Zaczynał się u dołu i

próbował jękliwie i nieśmiało altowych spełzłości i półtonów,

przechodził potem do spłowiałych popiołów dali, do gobelinowych błękitów

i rosnąc ku górze coraz szerszymi akordami, dochodził do ciemnych

granatów, do indyga lasów dalekich i do pluszu parków szumiących, ażeby

potem poprzez wszystkie ochry, sangwiny, rudości i sepie wejść w

szelestny cień więdnących ogrodów i dojść do ciemnego zapachu grzybów,

do tchnienia próchna w głębiach nocy jesiennej i do głuchego

akompaniamentu najciemniejszych basów. Ojciec mój szedł wzdłuż tych

arsenałów sukiennej jesieni i uspokajał i uciszał te masy, ich

wzbierającą moc, spokojną potęgę Pory. Chciał jak najdłużej utrzymać w

całości te rezerwy zamagazynowanej barwności. Bał się łamać, wymieniać

na gotówkę ten fundusz żelazny jesieni. Ale wiedział, czuł, że przyjdzie

czas i wicher jesienny, pustoszący i ciepły wicher, powieje nad tymi

szafami i wtedy puszczą one i nic nie zdoła powstrzymać ich wylewu, tych

strumieni kolorowości, którymi wybuchną na miasto całe. Przychodziła

pora Wielkiego Sezonu. Ożywiały się ulice. O szóstej godzinie po

południu miasto zakwitało gorączką, domy dostawały wypieków, a ludzie

wędrowali ożywieni jakimś wewnętrznym ogniem, naszminkowani i ubarwieni

jaskrawo, z oczyma błyszczącymi jaką odświętną, piękną i złą febrą. Na

bocznych uliczkach, w cichych zaułkach, uchodzących już w wieczorną

dzielnicę, miasto było puste. Tylko dzieci bawiły się na placykach pod

balkonami, bawiły się bez tchu, hałaśliwie i niedorzecznie. Przykładały

małe pęcherzyki do ust, ażeby wydmuchać je i naindyczyć się nagle

jaskrawo w wielkie, gulgocące, rozpluskane narośle albo wykogucić się w

głupią kogucią maskę, czerwoną i piejącą, w kolorowe jesienne maszkary

fantastyczne i absurdalne. Zdawało się, że tak nadęte i piejące wzniosą

się w powietrze długimi kolorowymi łańcuchami i jak jesienne klucze

ptaków przeciągać będą nad miastem - fantastyczne flotylle z bibułki i

pogody jesiennej. Albo woziły się wśród krzyków na małych zgiełkliwych

wózkach, grających kolorowym turkotem kółek, szprych i dyszli. Wózki

zjeżdżały naładowane ich krzykiem i staczały się w dół ulicy aż do nisko

rozlanej, żółtej rzeczki wieczornej, gdzie rozpadały się na gruz

krążków, kołków i patyczków. I podczas gdy zabawy dzieci stawały się

coraz bardziej hałaśliwe i splątane, wypieki miasta ciemniały i

zakwitały purpurą, nagle świat cały zaczynał więdnąć i czernieć i szybko

wydzielał się zeń majaczliwy zmierzch, którym zarażały się wszystkie

rzeczy. Zdradliwie i jadowicie szerzyła się ta zaraza zmierzchu wokoło,

szła od rzeczy do rzeczy, a czego dotknęła, to wnet butwiało, czerniało,

rozpadało się w próchno. Ludzie uciekali przed zmierzchem w cichym

popłochu i naraz dosięgał ich ten trąd, i wysypywał się ciemną wysypką

na czole, i tracili twarze, które odpadały wielkimi, bezkształtnymi

plamami, i szli dalej, już bez rysów, bez oczu, gubiąc po drodze maskę

po masce, tak że zmierzch roił się od tych larw porzuconych, sypiących

się za ich ucieczką. Potem zaczynało wszystko zarastać czarną,

próchniejącą korą, łuszczącą się wielkimi płatami, chorymi strupami

ciemności. A gdy w dole wszystko rozprzęgło się i szło wniwecz w tej

cichej zamieszce, w panice prędkiego rozkładu, w górze utrzymywał się i

rósł coraz wyżej milczący alarm zorzy, drgający świergotem miliona

cichych dzwonków, wzbierających wzlotem miliona cichych skowronków

lecących razem w jedną wielką, srebrną nieskończoność. Potem była już

nagle noc - wielka noc, rosnąca jeszcze podmuchami wiatru, które ją

rozszerzały. W jej wielokrotnym labiryncie wyłupane były gniazda jasne:

sklepy - wielkie, kolorowe latarnie, pełne spiętrzonego towaru i zgiełku

kupujących. Przez jasne szyby tych latarni można było śledzić zgiełkliwy

i pełen dziwacznego ceremoniału obrzęd zakupów jesiennych. Ta wielka,

fałdzista noc jesienna, rosnąca cieniami, rozszerzona wiatrami, kryła w

swych ciemnych fałdach jasne kieszenie, woreczki z kolorowym

drobiazgiem, z pstrym towarem czekoladek, keksów, kolonialnej

pstrokacizny. Te budki i kramiki, sklecone z pudełek po cukrach,

wytapetowane jaskrawo reklamami czekolad, pełne mydełek, wesołej

tandety, złoconych błahostek, cynfolii, trąbek, andrutów i kolorowych

miętówek, były stacjami lekkomyślności, grzechotkami beztroski,

rozsianymi na wiszarach ogromnej, labiryntowej, rozłopotanej wiatrami

nocy. Wielkie i ciemne tłumy płynęły w ciemności, w hałaśliwym

zmieszaniu, w szurgocie tysięcy nóg, w gwarze tysięcy ust - rojna,

splątana wędrówka, ciągnąca arteriami jesiennego miasta. Tak płynęła ta

rzeka, pełna gwaru, ciemnych spojrzeń, chytrych łypnięć, pokawałkowana

rozmową, posiekana gawędą, wielka miazga plotek, śmiechów i zgiełku.

Zdawało się, że to ruszyły tłumami jesienne, suche makówki sypiące

makiem - głowy-grzechotki, ludzie-kołatki. Mój ojciec chodził

zdenerwowany i kolorowy od wypieków, z błyszczącymi oczyma, w jasno

oświetlonym sklepie, i nasłuchiwał. Przez szyby wystawy i portalu

dochodził tu z daleka szum miasta, stłumiony gwar płynącej ciżby. Nad

ciszą sklepu płonęła jasno lampa naftowa, zwisająca z wielkiego

sklepienia, i wypierała najmniejszy ślad cienia z wszystkich szpar i

zakamarków. Pusta, wielka podłoga trzaskała w ciszy i liczyła w tym

świetle wzdłuż i wszerz swe błyszczące kwadraty, szachownicę wielkich

tafli, które rozmawiały ze sobą w ciszy trzaskami, odpowiadały sobie to

tu, to tam głośnym pęknięciem. Za to sukna leżały ciche, bez głosu, w

swej pilśniowej puszystości i podawały sobie wzdłuż ścian spojrzenia za

plecami ojca, wymieniały od szafy do szafy ciche znaki porozumiewawcze.

Ojciec nasłuchiwał. Jego ucho zdawało się w tej ciszy nocnej wydłużać i

rozgałęziać poza okno: fantastyczny koralowiec, czerwony polip falujący

w mętach nocy. Nasłuchiwał i słyszał. Słyszał z rosnącym niepokojem

daleki przypływ tłumów, które nadciągały. Rozglądał się z przerażeniem

po pustym sklepie. Szukał subiektów. Ale ci ciemni i rudzi aniołowie

dokądś odlecieli. Pozostał on sam tylko, w trwodze przed tłumami, które

wnet miały zalać ciszę sklepu plądrującą hałaśliwą rzeszą i rozebrać

między siebie, rozlicytować całą tę bogatą jesień, od lat zbieraną w

wielkim zacisznym spichlerzu. Gdzie byli subiekci? Gdzie były te

urodziwe cheruby, mające bronić ciemnych, sukiennych szańców? Ojciec

podejrzewał bolesną myślą, że oto grzeszą gdzie w głębi domu z córami

ludzi. Stojąc nieruchomy i pełen troski, z błyszczącymi oczyma w jasnej

ciszy sklepu, czuł wewnętrznym słuchem, co działo się w głębi domu, w

tylnych komorach wielkiej kolorowej tej latarni. Dom otwierał się przed

nim, izba za izbą, komora za komorą, jak dom z kart, i widział gonitwę

subiektów za Adelą przez wszystkie puste i jasno oświetlone pokoje,

schodami na dół, schodami do góry, aż wymknęła się im i wpadła do jasnej

kuchni, gdzie zabarykadowała się kuchennym kredensem. Tam stała

zdyszana, błyszcząca i rozbawiona, trzepocąca z uśmiechem wielkimi

rzęsami. Subiekci chichotali, przykucnięci pode drzwiami. Okno kuchni

otwarte było na wielką, czarną noc, pełną rojeń i splątania. Czarne,

uchylone szyby płonęły refleksem dalekiej iluminacji. Błyszczące garnki

i butle stały nieruchomo dokoła i lśniły w ciszy tłustą polewą. Adela

wychylała ostrożnie przez okno swą kolorową, uszminkowaną twarz z

trzepoczącymi oczyma. Szukała subiektów na ciemnym podwórzu, pewna ich

zasadzki. I oto ujrzała ich, jak wędrowali ostrożnie, gęsiego, po wąskim

gzymsie podokiennym wzdłuż ściany piętra, czerwonej odblaskiem dalekiej

iluminacji, i skradali się do okna. Ojciec krzyknął z gniewu i rozpaczy,

ale w tej chwili gwar głosów stał się całkiem bliski i nagle jasne okna

sklepu zaludniły się bliskimi twarzami, wykrzywionymi śmiechem,

rozgadanymi twarzami, które płaszczyły nosy na lśniących szybach. Ojciec

stał się purpurowy ze wzburzenia i wskoczył na ladę. I kiedy tłum

szturmem zdobywał tę twierdzę i wkraczał hałaśliwą ciżbą do sklepu,

ojciec mój jednym skokiem wspiął się na półki z suknem i, uwisły wysoko

nad tłumem, dął z całej siły w wielki puzon z rogu i trąbił na alarm.

Ale sklepienie nie napełniło się szumem aniołów, śpieszących na pomoc, a

zamiast tego każdemu jękowi trąby odpowiadał wielki, roześmiany chór

tłumu. - Jakubie, handlować! Jakubie, sprzedawać! - wołali wszyscy, a

wołanie to, wciąż powtarzane, rytmizowało się w chórze i przechodziło

powoli w melodię refrenu, śpiewaną przez wszystkie gardła. Wtedy mój

ojciec dał za wygraną, zeskoczył z wysokiego gzymsu i ruszył z krzykiem

ku barykadom sukna. Wyolbrzymiony gniewem, z głową spęczniałą w pięść

purpurową, wbiegł, jak walczący prorok, na szańce sukienne i jął

przeciwko nim szaleć. Wpierał się całym ciałem w potężne bale wełny i

wyważał je z osady, podsuwał się pod ogromne postawy sukna i unosił je

na ladę z głuchym łomotem. Bale leciały rozwijając się z łopotem w

powietrzu w ogromne chorągwie, półki wybuchały zewsząd wybuchami

draperii, wodospadami sukna, jak pod uderzeniem Mojżeszowej laski. Tak

wylewały się zapasy szaf, wymiotowały gwałtownie, płynęły szerokimi

rzekami. Wypływała barwna treść półek, rosła, mnożyła się i zalewała

wszystkie lady i stoły. Ściany sklepu znikły pod potężnymi formacjami

tej sukiennej kosmogonii, pod tymi pasmami górskimi, piętrzącymi się w

potężnych masywach. Otwierały się szerokie doliny wśród zboczy górskich

i wśród szerokiego patosu wyżyn grzmiały linie kontynentów. Przestrzeń

sklepu rozszerzyła się w panoramę jesiennego krajobrazu, pełną jezior i

dali, a na tle tej scenerii ojciec wędrował wśród fałd i dolin

fantastycznego Kanaanu, wędrował wielkimi krokami, z rękoma

rozkrzyżowanymi proroczo w chmurach, i kształtował kraj uderzeniami

natchnienia. A u dołu, u stóp tego Synaju, wyrosłego z gniewu ojca,

gestykulował lud, złorzeczył i czcił Baala, i handlował. Nabierali pełne

ręce miękkich fałd, drapowali się w kolorowe sukna, owijali się w

zaimprowizowane domina i płaszcze i gadali bezładnie a obficie. Mój

ojciec wyrastał nagle nad tymi grupami kupczących wydłużony gniewem, i

gromił z wysoka bałwochwalców potężnym słowem. Potem, ponoszony

rozpaczą, wspinał się na wysokie galerie szaf, biegł obłędnie po bantach

półek, po dudniących deskach ogołoconych rusztowań, ścigany przez obrazy

bezwstydnej rozpusty, którą przeczuwał za plecami w głębi domu. Subiekci

dosięgli właśnie żelaznego balkonu na wysokości okna i wczepieni w

balustradę, pochwycili wpół Adelę i wyciągnęli ją przez okno,

trzepocącą. oczyma i wlokącą za sobą smukłe nogi w jedwabnych

pończochach. Gdy ojciec mój, przerażony ohydą grzechu, wrastał gniewem

swych gestów w grozę krajobrazu, w dole beztroski lud Baala oddawał się

wyuzdanej wesołości. Jaka parodystyczna pasja, jaka zaraza śmiechu

opanowała tę gawiedź. Jakże można było żądać powagi od nich, od tego

ludu kołatek i dziadków do orzechów! Jak można było żądać zrozumienia

dla wielkich trosk ojca od tych młynków, mielących bezustannie kolorową

miazgę słów! Głusi na gromy proroczego gniewu, przykucali ci handlarze w

jedwabnych bekieszach małymi kupkami dookoła sfałdowanych gór materii,

rozstrząsając gadatliwie wśród śmiechu zalety towaru. Ta czarna giełda

roznosiła na swych prędkich językach szlachetną substancję krajobrazu,

rozdrabniała ją siekaniną gadania i połykała niemal. Gdzie indziej stały

grupy Żydów w kolorowych chałatach, w wielkich futrzanych kołpakach

przed wysokimi wodospadami jasnych materii. Byli to mężowie Wielkiego

Zgromadzenia, dostojni i pełni namaszczenia panowie, gładzący długie,

pielęgnowane brody i prowadzący wstrzemięźliwe i dyplomatyczne rozmowy.

Ale i w tej ceremonialnej konwersacji, w spojrzeniach, które wymieniali

był błysk uśmiechniętej ironii. Wśród tych grup przewijał się pospolity

lud, bezpostaciowy tłum, gawiedź bez twarzy i indywidualności. Wypełniał

on niejako luki w krajobrazie, wyścielał tło dzwonkami i grzechotkami

bezmyślnego gadania. Był to element błazeński, roztańczony tłum

poliszynelów i arlekinów, który - sam bez poważnych intencyj handlowych

- doprowadzał do absurdu gdzieniegdzie nawiązujące się transakcje swymi

błazeńskimi figlami. Stopniowo jednak, znudzony błaznowaniem, wesoły ten

ludek rozpraszał się w dalszych okolicach krajobrazu i tam powoli gubił

się wród skalnych załomów i dolin. Prawdopodobnie jeden po drugim

zapadały się te wesołki gdzieś w szczeliny i fałdy terenu, jak dzieci

zmęczone zabawą po kątach i zakamarkach mieszkania w noc balową.

Tymczasem ojcowie miasta, mężowie Wielkiego Synhedrionu, przechadzali

się w grupach pełnych powagi i godności i prowadzili ciche, głębokie

dysputy. Rozszedłszy się po całym, owym wielkim górzystym kraju,

wędrowali po dwóch, po trzech na dalekich i krętych drogach. Małe i

ciemne ich sylwety zaludniały całą tę pustynną wyżynę, nad którą zwisło

ciężkie i ciemne niebo, sfałdowane i chmurne, poorane w długie

równoległe bruzdy, w srebrne i białe skiby, ukazujące w głębi coraz

dalsze pokłady swego uwarstwienia. Światło lampy stwarzało sztuczny

dzień w owej krainie - dzień dziwny, dzień bez świtu i wieczoru. Ojciec

mój uspokajał się powoli. Gniew jego układał się i zastygał w pokładach

i warstwach krajobrazu. Siedział teraz na galeriach wysokich półek i

patrzył w jesienniejący, rozległy kraj. Widział, jak na dalekich

jeziorach odbywał się połów ryb. W maleńkich łupinkach łódek siedziało

po dwóch rybaków, zapuszczając sieci w wodę. Na brzegach chłopcy

dźwigali na głowach kosze, pełne trzepocącego się, srebrnego połowu.

Wówczas to dostrzegł, jak grupy wędrowców w oddali zadzierały głowy ku

niebu, wskazując coś wzniesionymi rękami. I wnet zaroiło się niebo jakąś

kolorową wysypką, osypało się falującymi plamami, które rosły,

dojrzewały i wnet napełniły przestworze dziwnym ludem ptaków, krążących

i kołujących w wielkich, krzyżujących się spiralach. Całe niebo

wypełniło się ich wzniosłym lotem, łopotem skrzydeł, majestatycznymi

liniami cichych bujań. Niektóre z nich jak ogromne bociany płynęły

nieruchomo na spokojnie rozpostartych skrzydłach, inne, podobne do

kolorowych pióropuszów, do barbarzyńskich trofeów, trzepotały ciężko i

niezgrabnie, ażeby utrzymać się na falach ciepłej aury; inne wreszcie,

nieudolne konglomeraty skrzydeł, potężnych nóg i oskubanych szyj,

przypominały źle wypchane sępy i kondory, z których wysypują się

trociny. Były między nimi ptaki dwugłowe, ptaki wieloskrzydłe, były też

i kaleki, kulejące w powietrzu jednoskrzydłym, niedołężnym lotem. Niebo

stało się podobne do starego fresku, pełnego dziwolągów i fantastycznych

zwierząt, które krążyły, wymijały się i znów wracały w kolorowych

elipsach. Mój ojciec podniósł się na bantach, oblany nagłym blaskiem,

wyciągnął ręce, przyzywając ptaki starym zaklęciem. Poznał je, pełen

wzruszenia. Było to dalekie, zapomniane potomstwo tej ptasiej generacji,

którą ongi Adela rozpędziła na wszystkie strony nieba. Wracało teraz,

zwyrodniałe i wybujałe, to sztuczne potomstwo, to zdegenerowane plemię

ptasie, zmarniałe wewnętrznie. Wystrzelone głupio wzrostem, wyogromnione

niedorzecznie, było wewnątrz puste i bez życia. Cała żywotność tych

ptaków przeszła w upierzenie, wybujała w fantastyczność. Było to jakby

muzeum wycofanych rodzajów, rupieciarnia Raju ptasiego. Niektóre latały

na wznak, miały ciężkie, niezgrabne dzioby, podobne do kłódek i zamków,

obciążone kolorowymi naroślami, i były ślepe. Jakże wzruszył ojca ten

powrót niespodziany, jakże zdumiewał się nad instynktem ptasim, nad tym

przywiązaniem do Mistrza, które wygnany ów ród piastował jak legendę w

duszy, ażeby wreszcie po wielu generacjach, w ostatnim dniu przed

wygaśnięciem plemienia pociągnąć z powrotem w pradawną ojczyznę. Ale te

papierowe, ślepe ptaki nie mogły już poznać ojca. Na darmo wołał na nie

dawnym zaklęciem, zapomnianą mową ptasią, nie słyszały go i nie

widziały. Nagle zagwizdały kamienie w powietrzu. To wesołki, głupie i

bezmyślne plemię, jęły celować pociskami w fantastyczne niebo ptasie. Na

darmo ojciec ostrzegał, na darmo groził zaklinającymi gestami, nie

dosłyszano go, nie dostrzeżono. I ptaki spadały. Ugodzone pociskiem,

obwisały ciężko i więdły już w powietrzu. Nim doleciały do ziemi, były

już bezforemną kupą pierza. W mgnieniu oka pokryła się wyżyna tą dziwną,

fantastyczną padliną. Zanim ojciec dobiegł do miejsca rzezi, cały ten

świetny ród ptasi już leżał martwy, rozciągnięty na skałach. Teraz

dopiero, z bliska, mógł ojciec obserwować całą lichotę tej zubożałej

generacji, całą śmiesznoć jej tandetnej anatomii. Były to ogromne

wiechcie piór, wypchane byle jak starym ścierwem. U wielu nie można było

wyróżnić głowy, gdyż pałkowata ta część ciała nie nosiła żadnych znamion

duszy. Niektóre pokryte były kudłatą, zlepioną sierścią, jak żubry, i

śmierdziały wstrętnie. Inne przypominały garbate, łyse, zdechłe

wielbłądy. Inne wreszcie były najwidoczniej z pewnego rodzaju papieru,

puste w środku, a świetnie kolorowe na zewnątrz. Niektóre okazywały się

z bliska niczym innym jak wielkimi pawimi ogonami, kolorowymi

wachlarzami, w które niepojętym sposobem tchnięto jakiś pozór życia.

Widziałem smutny powrót mego ojca. Sztuczny dzień zabarwiał się już

powoli kolorami zwyczajnego poranka. W spustoszałym sklepie najwyższe

półki syciły się barwami rannego nieba. Wśród fragmentów zgasłego

pejzażu, wśród zburzonych kulis nocnej scenerii - ojciec widział

wstających ze snu subiektów. Podnosili się spomiędzy bali sukna i

ziewali do słońca. W kuchni, na piętrze, Adela, ciepła od snu i ze

zmierzwionymi włosami, mełła kawę na młynku, przyciskając go do białej

piersi, od której ziarna nabierały blasku i gorąca. Kot mył się w słońcu.

Introduction to the Present Edition.

When the publisher entrusted me with the task of editing this
volume, one sheet was already printed and a considerable portion
of the book was in type.  Under his agreement with the owners of
the copyright, he was bound to reproduce the text and notes,
etc., originally prepared by Mr. David Lewis without any change,
so that my duty was confined to reading the proofs and verifying
the quotations.  This translation of the Life of St. Teresa is so
excellent, that it could hardly be improved.  While faithfully
adhering to her wording, the translator has been successful in
rendering the lofty teaching in simple and clear language, an
achievement all the more remarkable as in addition to the
difficulty arising from the transcendental nature of the subject
matter, the involved style, and the total absence of punctuation
tend to perplex the reader.  Now and then there might be some
difference of opinion as to how St. Teresa's phrases should be
construed, but it is not too much to say that on the whole
Mr. Lewis has been more successful than any other translator,
whether English or foreign.  Only in one case have I found it
necessary to make some slight alteration in the text, and I trust
the owners of the copyright will forgive me for doing so.  In
Chapter XXV., § 4, St. Teresa, speaking of the difference between
the Divine and the imaginary locutions, says that a person
commending a matter to God with great earnestness, may think that
he hears whether his prayer will be granted or not: y es muy
posible, "and this is quite possible," but he who has ever heard
a Divine locution will see at once that this assurance is
something quite different.  Mr. Lewis, following the old Spanish
editions, translated "And it is most impossible," whereas both
the autograph and the context demand the wording I have ventured
to substitute.

When Mr. Lewis undertook the translation of St. Teresa's works,
he had before him Don Vicente de la Fuente's edition (Madrid,
1861-1862), supposed to be a faithful transcript of the original.
In 1873 the Sociedad Foto-Tipografica-Catolica of Madrid
published a photographic reproduction of the Saint's autograph in
412 pages in folio, which establishes the true text once for all.
Don Vicente prepared a transcript of this, in which he wisely
adopted the modern way of spelling but otherwise preserved the
original text, or at least pretended to do so, for a minute
comparison between autograph and transcript reveals the startling
fact that nearly a thousand inaccuracies have been allowed to
creep in.  Most of these variants are immaterial, but there are
some which ought not to have been overlooked. Thus, in Chapter
XVIII. § 20, St. Teresa's words are: Un gran letrado de la orden
del glorioso santo Domingo, while Don Vicente retains the old
reading De la orden del glorioso patriarca santo Domingo.
Mr. Lewis possessed a copy of this photographic reproduction, but
utilised it only in one instance in his second edition. [1]

The publication of the autograph has settled a point of some
importance.  The Bollandists (n. 1520), discussing the question
whether the headings of the chapters (appended to this
Introduction) are by St. Teresa or a later addition, come to the
conclusion (against the authors of the Reforma de los Descalços)
that they are clearly an interpolation (clarissime patet) on
account of the praise of the doctrine contained in these
arguments.  Notwithstanding their high authority the Bollandists
are in this respect perfectly wrong, the arguments are entirely
in St. Teresa's own hand and are exclusively her own work.
The Book of Foundations and the Way of Perfection contain similar
arguments in the Saint's handwriting.  Nor need any surprise be
felt at the alleged praise of her doctrine for by saying: this
chapter is most noteworthy (Chap. XIV.), or: this is good
doctrine (Chap. XXI.), etc., she takes no credit for herself
because she never grows tired of repeating that she only delivers
the message she has received from our Lord. [2]  The Bollandists,
not having seen the original, may be excused, but P. Bouix (whom
Mr. Lewis follows in this matter) had no right to suppress these
arguments.  It is to be hoped that future editions of the works
of S. Teresa will not again deprive the reader of this remarkable
feature of her writings.  What she herself thought of her books
is best told by Yepes in a letter to Father Luis de Leon, the
first editor of her works: "She was pleased when her writings
were being praised and her Order and the convents were held in
esteem.  Speaking one day of the Way of Perfection, she rejoiced
to hear it praised, and said to me with great content: Some grave
men tell me that it is like Holy Scripture.  For being revealed
doctrine it seemed to her that praising her book was like
praising God." [3]

A notable feature in Mr. Lewis's translation is his division of
the chapters into short paragraphs.  But it appears that he
rearranged the division during the process of printing, with the
result that a large number of references were wrong.  No labour
has been spared in the correction of these, and I trust that the
present edition will be the more useful for it.  In quoting the
Way of Perfection and the Interior Castle (which he calls Inner
Fortress!) Mr. Lewis refers to similar paragraphs which, however,
are to be found in no English edition.  A new translation of
these two works is greatly needed, and, in the case of the Way of
Perfection, the manuscript of the Escurial should be consulted as
well as that of Valladolid.  Where the writings of S. John of the
Cross are quoted by volume and page, the edition referred to is
the one of 1864, another of Mr. Lewis's masterpieces.
The chapters in Ribera's Life of St. Teresa refer to the edition
in the Acts of the Saint by the Bollandists.  These and all other
quotations have been carefully verified, with the exception of
those taken from the works on Mystical theology by Antonius a
Spiritu Sancto and Franciscus a S. Thoma, which I was unable to
consult.  I should have wished to replace the quotations from
antiquated editions of the Letters of our Saint by references to
the new French edition by P. Grégoire de S. Joseph (Paris,
Poussielgue, 1900), which may be considered as the
standard edition.

In note 2 to Chap. XI. Mr. Lewis draws attention to a passage in
a sermon by S. Bernard containing an allusion to different ways
of watering a garden similar to St. Teresa's well-known
comparison.  Mr. Lewis's quotation is incorrect, and I am not
certain what sermon he may have had in view.  Something to the
point may be found in sermon 22 on the Canticle (Migne,
P. L. Vol. CLXXXIII, p. 879), and in the first sermon on the
Nativity of our Lord (ibid., p. 115), and also in a sermon on the
Canticle by one of St. Bernard's disciples (Vol. CLXXXIV.,
p. 195).  I am indebted to the Very Rev. Prior Vincent McNabb,
O.P., for the verification of a quotation from St. Vincent Ferrer
(Chap. XX. § 31).

Since the publication of Mr. Lewis's translation the uncertainty
about the date of St. Teresa's profession has been cleared up.
Yepes, the Bollandists, P. Bouix, Don Vicente de la Fuente,
Mr. Lewis, and numerous other writers assume that she entered the
convent of the Incarnation [4] on November 2nd, 1533, and made
her profession on November 3rd, 1534.  The remaining dates of
events previous to her conversion are based upon this, as will be
seen from the chronology printed by Mr. Lewis at the end of his
Preface and frequently referred to in the footnotes.  It rests,
however, on inadequate evidence, namely on a single passage in
the Life [5] where the Saint says that she was not yet twenty
years old when she made her first supernatural experience in
prayer.  She was twenty in March, 1535, and as this event took
place after her profession, the latter was supposed by Yepes and
his followers to have taken place in the previous November.
Even if we had no further evidence, the fact that St. Teresa is
not always reliable in her calculation should have warned us not
to rely too much upon a somewhat casual statement.  In the first
chapter, § 7, she positively asserts that she was rather less
than twelve years old at the death of her mother, whereas we know
that she was at least thirteen years and eight months old.  As to
the profession we have overwhelming evidence that it took place
on the 3rd of November, 1536, and her entrance in the convent a
year and a day earlier.  To begin with, we have the positive
statement of her most intimate friends, Julian d'Avila, Father
Ribera, S.J., and Father Jerome Gratian.  Likewise doña Maria
Pinel, nun of the Incarnation, says in her deposition: "She
(Teresa of Jesus) took the habit on 2 November, 1535." [6]
This is corroborated by various passages in the Saint's writings.
Thus, in Relation VII., written in 1575, she says, speaking of
herself: "This nun took the habit forty years ago."  Again in a
passage of the Life written about the end of 1564 or the
beginning of the following year, [7] she mentions that she has
been a nun for over twenty-eight years, which points to her
profession in 1536.  But there are two documents which place the
date of profession beyond dispute, namely the act of renunciation
of her right to the paternal inheritance and the deed of dowry
drawn up before a public notary.  Both bear the date 31 October,
1536.  The authors of the Reforma de los Descalços thought that
they must have been drawn up before St. Teresa took the habit,
and therefore placed this event in 1536 and the profession in
1537, but neither of these documents is necessarily connected
with the clothing, yet both must have been completed before
profession.  The Constitutions of Blessed John Soreth, drawn up
in 1462, which were observed at the convent of the Incarnation,
contain the following rule with regard to the reception and
training of novices: [8] Consulimus quod recipiendus ante
susceptionem habitus expediat se de omnibus quae habet in saeculo
nisi ex causa rationabili per priorem generalem vel provincialem
fuerit aliter ordinatum.  There was, indeed, good reason in the
case of St. Teresa to postpone these legal matters.  Her father
was much opposed to her becoming a nun, but considering his piety
it might have been expected that before the end of the year of
probation he would grant his consent (which in the event he did
the very day she took the habit), and make arrangements for the
dowry.  One little detail concerning her haste in entering the
convent has been preserved by the Reforma and the
Bollandists, [9] though neither seem to have understood its
meaning.  On leaving the convent of the Incarnation for
St. Joseph's in 1563, St. Teresa handed the prioress of the
former convent a receipt for her bedding, habit and discipline.
This almost ludicrous scrupulosity was in conformity with a
decision of the general chapter of 1342 which said: Ingrediens
ordinem ad sui ipsius instantiam habeat lectisternia pro se ipso,
sin autem recipiens solvat lectum illum.  As St. Teresa entered
the convent without the knowledge of her father she did not bring
this insignificant trousseau with her; accordingly the prioress
became responsible for it and obtained a receipt when St. Teresa
went to the new convent.  The dowry granted by Alphonso Sanchez
de Cepeda to his daughter consisted of twenty-five measures,
partly wheat, partly barley, or, in lieu thereof, two hundred
ducats per annum.  Few among the numerous nuns of the Incarnation
could have brought a better or even an equal dowry.

The date of St. Teresa's profession being thus fixed on the 3rd
of November, 1536, some other dates of the chronology must be
revised.  Her visit to Castellanos de la Canada must have taken
place in the early part of 1537.  But already before this time
the Saint had an experience which should have proved a warning to
her, and the neglect of which she never ceased to deplore, namely
the vision of our Lord; [10] her own words are that this event
took place "at the very beginning of her acquaintance with the
person" who exercised so dangerous an influence upon her.
Mr. Lewis assigns to it the date 1542, which is impossible seeing
that instead of twenty-six it was only twenty-two years before
she wrote that passage of her life.  Moreover, it would have
fallen into the midst of her lukewarmness (according to
Mr. Lewis's chronology) instead of the very beginning.  P. Bouix
rightly assigns it to the year 1537, but as he is two years in
advance of our chronology it does not agree with the surrounding
circumstances as described by him.  Bearing in mind the hint
St. Teresa gives [11] as to her disposition immediately after her
profession, we need not be surprised if the first roots of her
lukewarmness show themselves so soon.

From Castellanos she proceeded to Hortigosa on a visit to her
uncle.  While there she became acquainted with the book called
Tercer Abecedario.  Don Vicente remarks that the earliest edition
known to him was printed in 1537, which tells strongly against
the chronology of the Bollandists, P. Bouix, and others.
Again, speaking of her cure at Bezadas she gives a valuable hint
by saying that she remained blind to certain dangers for more
than seventeen years until the Jesuit fathers finally undeceived
her.  As these came to Avila in 1555 the seventeen years lead us
back to 1538, which precisely coincides with her sojourn at
Bezadas.  She remained there until Pascua florida of the
following year.  P. Bouix and others understand by this term Palm
Sunday, but Don Vicente shows good reason that Easter Sunday is
meant, which in 1539 was April the 6th.  She then returned to
Avila, more dead than alive, and remained seriously ill for
nearly three years, until she was cured through the miraculous
intervention of St. Joseph about the beginning of 1542.
Now began the period of lukewarmness which was temporally
interrupted by the illness and death of her father, in 1544 or
1545, and came to an end about 1555.  Don Vicente, followed by
Mr. Lewis, draws attention to what he believes to be a "proof of
great laxity of the convent," that St. Teresa should have been
urged by one of her confessors to communicate as often as once a
fortnight.  It should be understood that frequent communion such
as we now see it practised was wholly unknown in her time.
The Constitutions of the Order specified twelve days on which all
those that were not priests should communicate, adding:
Verumtamen fratres professi prout Deus eis devotionem contulerit
diebus dominicis et festis duplicibus (i.e., on feasts of our
Lady, the Apostles, etc.), communicare poterunt si qui velint.
Thus, communicating about once a month St. Teresa acted as
ordinary good Religious were wont to do, and by approaching the
sacrament more frequently she placed herself among the more
fervent nuns. [12]

St. Teresa wrote quite a number of different accounts of her
life.  The first, addressed to Father Juan de Padranos, S.J. [13]
and dated 1557, is now lost.  The second, written for St. Peter
of Alcantara, is Relation I. at the end of this volume; a copy of
it, together with a continuation (Relation II.) was sent to
Father Pedro Ibañez in 1562.  It is somewhat difficult to admit
that in the very same year she wrote another, more extensive,
account to the same priest, which is generally called the "first"
Life.  At the end of the Life such as we have it now, St. Teresa
wrote: "This book was finished in June, 1562," and Father Bañez
wrote underneath: "This date refers to the first account which
the Holy Mother Teresa of Jesus wrote of her life; it was not
then divided into chapters.  Afterwards she made this copy and
inserted in it many things which had taken place subsequent to
this date, such as the foundation of the monastery of St. Joseph
of Avila."  Elsewhere Father Bañez says: [14] "Of one of her
books, namely, the one in which she recorded her life and the
manner of prayer whereby God had led her, I can say that she
composed it to the end that her confessors might know her the
better and instruct her, and also that it might encourage and
animate those who learn from it the great mercy God had shown
her, a great sinner as she humbly acknowledged herself to be.
This book was already written when I made her acquaintance, her
previous confessors having given her permission to that effect.
Among these was a licentiate of the Dominican Order, the Reverend
Father Pedro Ibañez, reader of Divinity at Avila.  She afterwards
completed and recast this book."  These two passages of Bañez
have led the biographers of the Saint to think that she wrote her
Life twice, first in 1561 and the following year, completing it
in the house of Doña Luisa de la Cerda at Toledo, in the month of
June; and secondly between 1563 and 1565 at St. Joseph's Convent
of Avila.  They have been at pains to point out a number of
places which could not have been in the "first" Life, but must
have been added in the second; [15] and they took it for granted
that the letter with which the book as we now have it concludes,
was addressed to Father Ibañez in 1562, when the Saint sent him
the "first" Life.  It bears neither address nor date, but from
its contents I am bound to conclude that it was written in 1565,
that it refers to the "second" Life, and that whomsoever it was
addressed to, it cannot have been to Father Ibañez, who was
already dead at the time. [16]  Saint Teresa asks the writer to
send a copy of the book to Father Juan de Avila.  Now we know
from her letters that as late as 1568 this request had not been
complied with, and that St. Teresa had to write twice to Doña
Luisa for this purpose; [17] but if she had already given these
instructions in 1562, it is altogether incomprehensible that she
did not see to it earlier, especially when the "first" Life was
returned to her for the purpose of copying and completing it.
The second reason which prevents me from considering this letter
as connected with the "first" Life will be examined when I come
to speak of the different ends the Saint had in view when writing
her Life.  It is more difficult to say to whom the letter was
really addressed.  The Reforma suggests Father Garcia de Toledo,
Dominican, who bade the Saint write the history of the foundation
of St. Joseph's at Avila [18] and who was her confessor at that
convent.  It moreover believes that he it is to whom Chapter
XXXIV. §§ 8-20 refers, and this opinion appears to me plausible.
As to the latter point, Yepes thinks the Dominican at Toledo was
Father Vicente Barron, the Bollandists offer no opinion, and
Mr. Lewis, in his first edition gives first the one and then the
other.  If, as I think, Father Garcia was meant, the passage in
Chapter XVI. § 10, beginning "O, my son," would concern him also,
as well as several passages where Vuestra Merced--you, my
Father--is addressed.  For although the book came finally into
the hands of Father Bañez, it was first delivered into those of
the addressee of the letter.

Whether the previous paper was a mere "Relation," or really a
first attempt at a "Life," [19] there can be no dispute about its
purpose: St. Teresa speaks of it in the following terms: "I had
recourse to my Dominican father (Ibañez); I told him all about my
visions, my way of prayer, the great graces our Lord had given
me, as clearly as I could, and begged him to consider the matter
well, and tell me if there was anything therein at variance with
the Holy Writings, and give me his opinion on the whole
matter." [20]  The account thus rendered had the object of
enabling Father Ibañez to give her light upon the state of her
soul.  But while she was drawing it up, a great change came over
her.  During St. Teresa's sojourn at Toledo she became from a
pupil an experienced master in Mystical knowledge.  "When I was
there a religious" (probably Father Garcia de Toledo) "with whom
I had conversed occasionally some years ago, happened to arrive.
When I was at Mass in a monastery of his Order, I felt a longing
to know the state of his soul." [21]  Three times the Saint rose
from her seat, three times she sat down again, but at last she
went to see him in a confessional, not to ask for any light for
herself, but to give him what light she could, for she wished to
induce him to surrender himself more perfectly to God, and this
she accomplished by telling him how she had fared since their
last meeting.  No one who reads this remarkable chapter can help
being struck by the change that has come over Teresa: the period
of her schooling is at an end, and she is now the great teacher
of Mystical theology.  Her humility does not allow her to speak
with the same degree of openness upon her achievements as she did
when making known her failings, yet she cannot conceal the Gift
of Wisdom she had received and the use she made of it.

St. Teresa's development, if extraordinary considering the degree
of spirituality she reached, was nevertheless gradual and
regular.  With her wonderful power of analysis, she has given us
not only a clear insight into her interior progress, but also a
sketch of the development of her understanding of supernatural
things.  "It is now (i.e., about the end of 1563) some five or
six years, I believe, since our Lord raised me to this state of
prayer, in its fulness, and that more than once,--and I never
understood it, and never could explain it; and so I was resolved,
when I should come thus far in my story, to say very little or
nothing at all." [22]  In the following chapter she adds: "You,
my father, will be delighted greatly to find an account of the
matter in writing, and to understand it; for it is one grace that
our Lord gives grace; and it is another grace to understand what
grace and what gift it is; and it is another and further grace to
have the power to describe and explain it to others.  Though it
does not seem that more than the first of these--the giving of
grace--is necessary, it is a great advantage and a great grace to
understand it." [23]  These words contain the clue to much that
otherwise would be obscure in the life of our Saint: great graces
were bestowed upon her, but at first she neither understood them
herself nor was she able to describe them.  Hence the inability
of her confessors and spiritual advisers to guide her.
Her natural gifts, great though they were, did not help her much.
"Though you, my father, may think that I have a quick
understanding, it is not so; for I have found out in many ways
that my understanding can take in only, as they say, what is
given it to eat.  Sometimes my confessor used to be amazed at my
ignorance: and he never explained to me--nor, indeed, did I
desire to understand--how God did this, nor how it could be.
Nor did I ever ask." [24]  At first she was simply bewildered by
the favours shown her, afterwards she could not help knowing,
despite the fears of over anxious friends, that they did come
from God, and that so far from imperilling her soul made a
different woman of her, but even then she was not able to explain
to others what she experienced in herself.  But shortly before
the foundation of St. Joseph's convent she received the last of
the three graces mentioned above, the Gift of Wisdom, and the
scene at Toledo is the first manifestation of it.

This explains the difference of the "Life" such as we know it
from the first version or the "Relations" preceding it.
Whatever this writing was, it still belonged to the period of her
spiritual education, whereas the volume before us is the
first-fruit of her spiritual Mastership.  The new light that had
come to her induced her confessors [25] to demand a detailed work
embodying everything she had learned from her heavenly
Teacher. [26]  The treatise on Mystical theology contained in
Chapters X. to XXI., the investigation of Divine locutions,
Visions and Revelations in the concluding portion of the work
could have had no place in any previous writing.  While her
experiences before she obtained the Gift of Wisdom influenced but
three persons (one of them being her father), a great many
profited by her increased knowledge. [27]  The earlier writings
were but confidential communications to her confessors, and if
they became known to larger circles this was due to indiscretion.
But her "Life" was written from the beginning with a view to
publication.  Allusions to this object may be found in various
places [28] as well as in the letter appended to the book, [29]
but the decisive utterances must be sought for elsewhere, namely
in the "Way of Perfection." This work was written immediately
after the "Life," while the Saint was as yet at the convent of
St. Joseph's.  It was re-written later on and is now only known
in its final shape, but the first version, the original of which
is preserved at the Escurial and has been reproduced
photographically, leaves no doubt as to the intentions of
St. Teresa in writing her "Life."  "I have written a few days ago
a certain Relation of my Life.  But since it might happen that my
confessor may not permit you (the Sisters of St. Joseph's) to
read it, I will put here some things concerning prayer which are
conformable to what I have said there, as well as some other
things which appear to me to be necessary." [30]  Again: "As all
this is better explained in the book which I say I have written,
there is no need for me to speak of it with so much detail.
I have said there all I know. Those of you who have been led by
God to this degree of contemplation (and I say that some have
been led so far), should procure the book because it is important
for you, after I am dead." [31]  At the end she writes: "Since
the Lord has taught you the way and has inspired me as to what I
should put in the book which I say has been written, how they
should behave who have arrived at this fountain of living water
and what the soul feels there, and how God satiates her and makes
her lose the thirst for things of this world and causes her to
grow in things pertaining to the service of God; that book,
therefore, will be of great help for those who have arrived at
this state, and will give them much light.  Procure it.
For Father Domingo Bañez, presentado of the Order of St. Dominic
who, as I say, is my confessor, and to whom I shall give this,
has it: if he judges that you should see this, and gives it to
you, he will also give you the other." [32]  While the first and
second of these quotations may be found, somewhat weakened, in
the final version of the "Way of Perfection," the last one is
entirely omitted.  Nor need this surprise us, for Father Bañez
had his own ideas about the advisability of the publication of
the "Life." In his deposition, already referred to, he says: "It
was not convenient that this book should become public during her
lifetime, but rather that it should be kept at the Holy Office
(the Inquisition) until we knew the end of this person; it was
therefore quite against my will that some copies were taken while
it was in the hands of the bishop Don Alvaro Mendoza, who, being
a powerful prelate and having received it from the said Teresa of
Jesus, allowed it to be copied and showed it to his sister, doña
Maria de Mendoza; thus certain persons taking an interest in
spiritual matters and knowing already some portions of this
treatise (evidently the contents of the divulged Relations) made
further copies, one of which became the property of the Duchess
of Alba, doña Maria Enriquez, and is now, I think, in the hands
of her daughter-in-law, doña Maria de Toledo.  All this was
against my wish, and I was much annoyed with the said Teresa of
Jesus, though I knew well it was not her fault but the fault of
those to whom she had confided the book, and I told her she ought
to burn the original because it would never do that the writings
of women should become public property; to which she answered she
was quite aware of it and would certainly burn it if I told her
to do so; but knowing her great humility and obedience I did not
dare to have it destroyed but handed it to the Holy Office for
safe-keeping, whence it has been withdrawn since her death and
published in print." [33]  From this it will be seen that Bañez,
who had given a most favourable opinion when the "Life" was
denounced to the Inquisition (1574), resulting in the approbation
by Cardinal de Quiroga to the great joy of St. Teresa, [34]
returned it to the Holy Office for safety's sake. It was
withdrawn by the Ven. Mother Anne of Jesus when the Order had
decided upon the publication of the works of the Saint, but too
late to be utilised then.  Father Luis de Leon, the editor, had
to content himself with the copy already alluded to.

St. Teresa wrote her "Life" slowly.  It was begun in spring,
1563, [35] and completed in May or June, 1565.  She complains
that she can only work at it by stealth on account of her duties
at the distaff; [36] but the book is written with so much order
and method, the manuscript is so free from mistakes, corrections
and erasures, that we may conclude that while spinning she worked
it out in her mind, so that the apparent delay proved most
advantageous.  In this respect the "Life" is superior to the
first version of the "Way of Perfection."  This latter work was
printed during her lifetime, though it appeared only after her
death.  In 1586 the Definitory of the province of Discalced
Carmelites decided upon the publication of the complete works of
the Saint, but for obvious reasons deemed not only the members of
her own Order but also Dominicans and Jesuits ineligible for the
post of editor.  Such of the manuscripts as could be found were
therefore confided to the Augustinian Father, Luis de Leon,
professor at Salamanca, who prepared the edition but did not live
to carry it through the press.  The fact that he did not know the
autograph of the "Life" accounts for the numerous inaccuracies to
be found in nearly all editions, but the publication of the
original should ensure a great improvement for the future.

St. Teresa's canonisation took place before the stringent laws of
Urban VIII. came into force.  Consequently, the writings of the
Saint were not then enquired into, the Holy See contenting itself
with the approbations granted by the Spanish Inquisition, and by
the congregation of the Rota in Rome.  A certain number of
passages selected from various works having been denounced by
some Roman theologians as being contrary to the teaching of
St. Thomas Aquinas and other authorities, Diego Alvarez, a
Dominican, and John Rada, a Franciscan, were commissioned to
examine the matter and report on it.  The twelve censures with
the answers of the two theologians and the final judgment of the
Rota seem to have remained unknown to the Bollandists. [37]
The "heavenly doctrine" of St. Teresa is alluded to not only in
the Bull of canonisation but even in the Collect of the Mass of
the Saint.

Concerning the English translations of the "Life" noticed by
Mr. Lewis it should be mentioned that the one ascribed to Abraham
Woodhead is only partly his work.  Father Bede of St. Simon Stock
(Walter Joseph Travers), a Discalced Carmelite, labouring on the
English Mission from 1660 till 1692, was anxious to complete the
translation of St. Teresa's works into English.  He had not
proceeded very far when he learnt that "others were engaged in
the same task.  On enquiry he found that a new translation was
contemplated by two graduates of the University of Cambridge,
converts to the Faith, most learned and pious men, who were
leading a solitary life, spending their time and talents in the
composition of controversial and devotional works for the good of
their neighbour and the glory of God."  One of these two men was
Woodhead, who, however, was an Oxford man, but the name of the
other, who must have been a Cambridge man, is not known.
They undertook the translation while Father Bede provided the
funds and bore the risks of what was then a dangerous work.
As there existed already two English translations of the "Life,"
the first volume to appear (1669) contained the Book of
Foundations, to which was prefixed the history of the foundation
of St. Joseph's from the "Life."  When, therefore, the new
translation of the latter appeared, in 1671, this portion of the
book was omitted. [38]  The translation was made direct from the
Spanish but "uniformly with the Italian edition."

Mr. Lewis, whose translation is the fifth, was born on the 12th
of November, 1814, and died on January the 23rd, 1895.  The first
edition was printed in 1870, the second in 1888.  It is
regrettable that the latter edition, of which the present is a
reprint, omitted the marginal notes which would have been so
helpful to the reader.

St. Teresa's life and character having always been a favourite
study of men and women of various schools of thought, it may be
useful to notice here a few recent English and foreign works on
the subject:--

The Life of Saint Teresa, by the author of "Devotions before and
after Holy Communion" (i.e., Miss Maria Trench), London, 1875.

The Life of Saint Teresa of the Order of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel.  Edited with a preface by the Archbishop of Westminster
(Cardinal Manning), London, 1865.  (By Miss Elizabeth Lockhart,
afterwards first abbess of the Franciscan convent, Notting Hill.)
Frequently reprinted.

The Life and Letters of St. Teresa, by Henry James Coleridge,
S.J.  Quarterly Series.  3 vols (1881, 1887, 1888).

And, from another point of view:

The Life of St. Teresa, by Gabriela Cunninghame-Graham, 2 vols,
London, 1894.

Histoire de Sainte Thérèse d'après les Bollandistes.  2 vols,
Nantes, 1882.  Frequently reprinted.  The author is
Mlle. Adelaide Lecornu (born 5 July, 1852, died at the Carmelite
convent at Caen, 14 December, 1901.  Her name in religion was
Adelaide-Jéronyme-Zoe-Marie du Sacré-Coeur).

An excellent character sketch of the Saint has appeared in the
"Les Saints" series (Paris, Lecoffre, 1901):

Sainte Thérèse, par Henri Joly.

Although the attempt at explaining the extraordinary phenomena in
the life of St. Teresa by animal Magnetism and similar obscure
theories had already been exploded by the Bollandists, it has
lately been revived by Professor Don Arturo Perales Gutierrez of
Granada, and Professor Don Fernando Segundo Brieva Salvatierra of
Madrid, who considered her a subject of hysterical derangements.
The discussion carried on for some time, not only in Spain but
also in France, Germany, and other countries, has been ably
summed up and disposed of by P. Grégoire de S. Joseph: La
prétendue Hystérie de Sainte Thérèse. Lyons.

The Bibliographie Thérèsienne, by Henry de Curzon (Paris, 1902)
is, unfortunately, too incomplete, not to say slovenly, to be of
much use.

Finally, it is necessary to say a word about the spelling of the
name Teresa.  In Spanish and Italian it should be written without
an h as these languages do not admit the use of Th; in English,
likewise, where this combination of letters represents a special
sound, the name should be spelt with T only.  But the present
fashion of thus writing it in Latin, German, French, and other
languages, which generally maintain the etymological spelling, is
intolerable: The name is Greek, and was placed on the calendar in
honour of a noble Spanish lady, St. Therasia, who became the wife
of a Saint, Paulinus of Nola, and a Saint herself.  See Sainte
Thérèse, Lettres au R. P. Bouix, by the Abbé Postel, Paris, 1864.
The derivation of the name from the Hebrew Thersa can no longer
be defended (Father Jerome-Gratian, in Fuente, Obras, Vol. VI.,
p. 369 sqq.).

7. Chap. xxxvi. § 10.  The date of this part of the Life can be
easily ascertained from the two following chapters.  In xxxvii. §
18, St. Teresa says that she is not yet fifty years old,
consequently the chapter must have been written before the end of
March, 1565; and in the next chapter, xxxviii. § 15, she speaks
of the death of Father Pedro Ibañez, which appears to have taken
place on 2nd February.  This, at least, is the date under which
his name appears in the Année Dominicaine, and the Very
Rev. Prior Vincent McNabb tells me that there is every reason to
think that it is the date of his death.

8. When about A.D. 1452 certain communities of Beguines demanded
affiliation to the Carmelite Order, they were given the
Constitutions of the friars without any alterations.
These Constitutions were revised in 1462, but neither there nor
in the Acts of the General Chapters, so far as these are
preserved, is there the slightest reference to convents of nuns.
The colophon of the printed edition (Venice, 1499) shows that
they held good for friars and nuns: Expliciunt sacrae
constitutiones novae fratrum et sororum beatae Mariae de Monte
Carmelo.  They contain the customary laws forbidding the friars
under pain of excommunication, to leave the precincts of their
convents without due licence, but do not enjoin strict enclosure,
which would have been incompatible with their manner of life and
their various duties.  St. Teresa nowhere insinuates that the
Constitutions, such as they were, were not kept at the
Incarnation; her remarks in chap. vii. are aimed at the
Constitutions themselves, which were never made for nuns, and
therefore did not provide for the needs of their convents.

were, besides the Saint, Father Julian de Avila, Don Francisco de
Salcedo, St. John of the Cross, and Don Lorenzo de Cepeda,
St. Teresa's brother: but this is impossible at the date of this
part of the "Life."  It is more probable that she meant Francisco
de Salcedo, Gaspar Daza, Julian de Avila, and Father Ibañez, the
latter being still alive in the beginning of 1564, when this
chapter was written.  It is more difficult to say who the three
confessors were whom St. Teresa desired to see the "Life"
(ch. xl. § 32).  If, as I think, the book was first handed to
Father Garcia de Toledo, the others may have been Francisco de
Salcedo, Baltasar Alvarez, and Gaspar de Salazar.

35. In the Prologue to the Book of Foundations, St. Teresa says
that Father Garcia de Toledo ordered her to rewrite the book the
same year in which St. Joseph's Convent was founded, i.e. 1562,
but seeing that she only spent a few hours there and that the
principal difficulties only arose after her return to the
Incarnation, it appears more probable that Father Garcia's
command was not made until the spring of the following year, when
she went to live at St. Joseph's.

St. Teresa's Arguments of the Chapters.


J.H.S.


J.H.S. Chapter I. [1]--In which she tells how God [2] began to
dispose this soul from childhood for virtue, and how she was
helped by having virtuous parents.

Chapter II.--How she lost these virtues and how important it is
to deal from childhood with virtuous persons.

Chapter III.--In which she sets forth how good company was the
means of her resuming good intentions, and in what manner God
began to give her some light on the deception to which she
was subjected.

Chapter IV.--She explains how, with the assistance of God, she
compelled herself to take the (Religious) habit, and how His
Majesty began to send her many infirmities.

Chapter V.--She continues to speak of the great infirmities she
suffered and the patience God gave her to bear them, and how He
turned evil into good, as is seen from something that happened
at the place where she went for a cure.

Chapter VI.--Of the great debt she owes God for giving her
conformity of her will (with His) in her trials, and how she
turned towards the glorious St. Joseph as her helper and
advocate, and how much she profited thereby.

Chapter VII.--Of the way whereby she lost the graces God had
granted her, and the wretched life she began to lead; she also
speaks of the danger arising from the want of a strict enclosure
in convents of nuns.

Chapter VIII.--Of the great advantage she derived from not
entirely abandoning prayer so as not to lose her soul; and what
an excellent remedy this is in order to win back what one has
lost.  She exhorts everybody to practise prayer, and shows what a
gain it is, even if one should have given it up for a time, to
make use of so great a good.

Chapter IX.--By what means God began to rouse her soul and give
light in the midst of darkness, and to strengthen her virtues so
that she should not offend Him.

Chapter X.--She begins to explain the graces God gave her in
prayer, and how much we can do for ourselves, and of the
importance of understanding God's mercies towards us.
She requests those to whom this is to be sent to keep the
remainder (of this book) secret, since they have commanded her to
go into so many details about the graces God has shown her.

Chapter XI.--In which she sets forth how it is that we do not
love God perfectly in a short time.  She begins to expound by
means of a comparison four degrees of prayer, of the first of
which she treats here; this is most profitable for beginners and
for those who find no taste in prayer.

Chapter XII.--Continuation of the first state.  She declares how
far, with the grace of God, we can proceed by ourselves, and
speaks of the danger of seeking supernatural and extraordinary
experiences before God lifts up the soul.

Chapter XIII.--She continues to treat of the first degree, and
gives advice with respect to certain temptations sometimes sent
by Satan.  This is most profitable.

Chapter XIV.--She begins to explain the second degree of prayer
in which God already gives the soul special consolations, which
she shows here to be supernatural.  This is most noteworthy.

Chapter XV.--Continuing the same subject, she gives certain
advice how one should behave in the prayer of quiet.  She shows
that many souls advance so far, but that few go beyond.
The matters treated of in this chapter are very necessary
and profitable.

Chapter XVI.--On the third degree of prayer; she declares things
of an elevated nature; what the soul that has come so far can do,
and the effect of such great graces of God.  This is calculated
to greatly animate the spirit to the praise of God, and contains
advice for those who have reached this point.

Chapter XVII.--Continues to declare matters concerning the third
degree of prayer and completes the explanation of its effects.
She also treats of the impediment caused by the imagination and
the memory.

Chapter XVIII.--She treats of the fourth degree of prayer, and
begins to explain [3] in what high dignity God holds a soul that
has attained this state; this should animate those who are given
to prayer, to make an effort to reach so high a state since it
can be obtained in this world, though not by merit but only
through the goodness of God. [4]

Chapter XIX.--She continues the same subject, and begins to
explain the effects on the soul of this degree of prayer.
She earnestly exhorts not to turn back nor to give up prayer even
if, after having received this favour, one should fall.
She shows the damage that would result (from the neglect of this
advice). This is most noteworthy and consoling for the weak and
for sinners.

Chapter XX.--She speaks of the difference between Union and
Trance, and explains what a Trance is; she also says something
about the good a soul derives from being, through God's goodness,
led so far.  She speaks of the effects of Union. [5]

Chapter XXI.--She continues and concludes this last degree of
prayer, and says what a soul having reached it feels when obliged
to turn back and live in the world, and speaks of the light God
gives concerning the deceits (of the world).  This is
good doctrine.

Chapter XXII.--In which she shows that the safest way for
contemplatives is not to lift up the spirit to high things but to
wait for God to lift it up.  How the Sacred Humanity of Christ is
the medium for the most exalted contemplation.  She mentions an
error under which she laboured for some time.  This chapter is
most profitable.

Chapter XXIII.--She returns to the history of her life, how she
began to practise greater perfection.  This is profitable for
those who have to direct souls practising prayer that they may
know how to deal with beginners, and she speaks of the profit she
derived from such knowledge.

Chapter XXIV.--She continues the same subject and tells how her
soul improved since she began to practise obedience, and how
little she was able to resist God's graces, and how His Majesty
continued to give them more and more abundantly.

Chapter XXV.--Of the manner in which Locutions of God are
perceived by the soul without being actually heard; and of some
deceits that might take place in this matter, and how one is to
know which is which.  This is most profitable for those who are
in this degree of prayer, because it is very well explained, and
contains excellent doctrine.

Chapter XXVI.--She continues the same subject; explains and tells
things that have happened to her which caused her to lose fear
and convinced her that the spirit which spoke to her was a
good one.

Chapter XXVII.--Of another way in which God teaches a soul, and,
without speaking, makes His Will known in an admirable manner.
She goes on to explain a vision, though not an imaginary one, and
a great grace with which God favoured her.  This chapter
is noteworthy.

Chapter XXVIII.--She treats of the great favours God showed her,
and how He appeared to her for the first time; she explains what
an imaginary vision is, and speaks of the powerful effects it
leaves and the signs whether it is from God.  This chapter is
most profitable and noteworthy.

Chapter XXIX.--She continues and tells of some great mercies God
showed her, and what His Majesty said to her in order to assure
her (of the truth of these visions), and taught her how to
answer contradictors.

Chapter XXX.--She continues the history of her life, and how God
sent her a remedy for all her anxieties by calling the holy Friar
Fray Pedro de Alcantara of the Order of the glorious St. Francis
to the place where she lived.  She mentions some great
temptations and interior trials through which she sometimes had
to pass.

Chapter XXXI.--She speaks of some exterior temptations and
apparitions of Satan, and how he ill-treated her.  She mentions,
moreover, some very good things by way of advice to persons who
are walking on the way of perfection.

Chapter XXXII.--She narrates how it pleased God to put her in
spirit in that place of Hell she had deserved by her sins.
She tells a little [6] of what she saw there compared with what
there was besides.  She begins to speak of the manner and way
of founding the convent of St. Joseph where she now lives.

Chapter XXXIII.--She continues the subject of the foundation of
the glorious St. Joseph.  How she was commanded to have nothing
(further) to do with it, how she abandoned it, also the troubles
it brought her and how God consoled her in all this.

Chapter XXXIV.--She shows how at that time it happened that she
absented herself from this place and how her Superior commanded
her to go away at the request of a very noble lady who was in
great affliction.  She begins to tell what happened to her there,
and the great grace God bestowed upon her in determining through
her instrumentality a person of distinction to serve Him truly;
and how that person found favour and help in her (Teresa).
This is noteworthy.

Chapter XXXV.--Continuation of the foundation of this house of
our glorious Father St. Joseph; in what manner our Lord ordained
that holy poverty should be observed there; the reason why she
left the lady with whom she had been staying, and some other
things that happened.

Chapter XXXVI.--She continues the same subject, and shows how the
foundation of this convent of the glorious St. Joseph was finally
accomplished, and the great contradictions and persecutions she
had to endure after the Religious had taken the habit, and the
great trials and temptations through which she passed, and how
God led her forth victorious to His own glory and praise.

Chapter XXXVII.--Of the effects which remained when God granted
her some favour; together with other very good doctrine.
She shows how one ought to strive after and prize every increase
in heavenly glory, and that for no trouble whatever one should
neglect a good that is to be perpetual.

Chapter XXXVIII.--She treats of some great mercies God showed
her, even making known to her heavenly secrets by means of
visions and revelations His Majesty vouchsafed to grant her; she
speaks of the effects they caused and the great improvement
resulting in her soul.

Chapter XXXIX.--She continues the same subject, mentioning great
graces granted her by God; how He promised to hear her requests
on behalf of persons for whom she should pray.  Some remarkable
instances in which His Majesty thus favoured her.

Chapter XL.--Continuation of the same subject of great mercies
God has shown her.  From some of these very good doctrine may be
gathered, and this, as she declares, was, besides compliance with
obedience, her principal motive (in writing this book), namely to
enumerate such of these mercies as would be instructive to souls.
This chapter brings the history of her Life, written by herself,
to an end.  May it be for the glory of God.  Amen.

Preface by David Lewis.


St. Teresa was born in Avila on Wednesday, March 28, 1515.
Her father was Don Alfonso Sanchez de Cepeda, and her mother Doña
Beatriz Davila y Ahumada.  The name she received in her baptism
was common to both families, for her great-grandmother on the
father's side was Teresa Sanchez, and her grandmother on her
mother's side was Teresa de las Cuevas.  While she remained in
the world, and even after she had become a nun in the monastery
of the Incarnation, which was under the mitigated rule, she was
known as Doña Teresa Sanchez Cepeda Davila y Ahumada; for in
those days children took the name either of the father or of the
mother, as it pleased them.  The two families were noble, but
that of Ahumada was no longer in possession of its former wealth
and power. [1]  Doña Beatriz was the second wife of Don Alfonso,
and was related in the fourth degree to the first wife, as
appears from the dispensation granted to make the marriage valid
on the 16th of October, 1509.  Of this marriage Teresa was the
third child.

Doña Beatriz died young, and the eldest daughter, Maria de
Cepeda, took charge of her younger sisters--they were two--and
was as a second mother to them till her marriage, which took
place in 1531, when the Saint was in her sixteenth year.  But as
she was too young to be left in charge of her father's house, and
as her education was not finished, she was sent to the
Augustinian monastery, the nuns of which received young girls,
and brought them up in the fear of God. [2]  The Saint's own
account is that she was too giddy and careless to be trusted at
home, and that it was necessary to put her under the care of
those who would watch over her and correct her ways.
She remained a year and a half with the Augustinian nuns, and all
the while God was calling her to Himself.  She was not willing to
listen to His voice; she would ask the nuns to pray for her that
she might have light to see her way; "but for all this," she
writes, "I wished not to be a nun." [3]  By degrees her will
yielded, and she had some inclination to become a religious at
the end of the eighteen months of her stay, but that was all.
She became ill; her father removed her, and the struggle within
herself continued,--on the one hand, the voice of God calling
her; on the other, herself labouring to escape from her vocation.

At last, after a struggle which lasted three months, she made up
her mind, and against her inclination, to give up the world.
She asked her father's leave, and was refused.  She besieged him
through her friends, but to no purpose.  "The utmost I could get
from him," she says, "was that I might do as I pleased after his
death." [4]  How long this contest with her father lasted is not
known, but it is probable that it lasted many months, for the
Saint was always most careful of the feelings of others, and
would certainly have endured much rather than displease a father
whom she loved so much, and who also loved her more than his
other children. [5]

But she had to forsake her father, and so she left her father's
house by stealth, taking with her one of her brothers, whom she
had persuaded to give himself to God in religion.  The brother
and sister set out early in the morning, the former for the
monastery of the Dominicans, and the latter for the Carmelite
monastery of the Incarnation, in Avila.  The nuns received her
into the house, but sent word to her father of his child's
escape.  Don Alfonso, however, yielded at once, and consented to
the sacrifice which he was compelled to make.

In the monastery of the Incarnation the Saint was led on, without
her own knowledge, to states of prayer so high, that she became
alarmed about herself.  In the purity and simplicity of her soul,
she feared that the supernatural visitations of God might after
all be nothing else but delusions of Satan. [6]  She was so
humble, that she could not believe graces so great could be given
to a sinner like herself.  The first person she consulted in her
trouble seems to have been a layman, related to her family, Don
Francisco de Salcedo.  He was a married man, given to prayer, and
a diligent frequenter of the theological lectures in the
monastery of the Dominicans.  Through him she obtained the help
of a holy priest, Gaspar Daza, to whom she made known the state
of her soul.  The priest, hindered by his other labours, declined
to be her director, and the Saint admits that she could have made
no progress under his guidance. [7]  She now placed herself in
the hands of Don Francis, who encouraged her in every way, and,
for the purpose of helping her onwards in the way of perfection,
told her of the difficulties he himself had met with, and how by
the grace of God he had overcome them.

But when the Saint told him of the great graces which God
bestowed upon her, Don Francis became alarmed; he could not
reconcile them with the life the Saint was living, according to
her own account. He never thought of doubting the Saint's
account, and did not suspect her of exaggerating her
imperfections in the depths of her humility: "he thought the evil
spirit might have something to do" with her, [8] and advised her
to consider carefully her way of prayer.

Don Francis now applied again to Gaspar Daza, and the two friends
consulted together; but, after much prayer on their part and on
that of the Saint, they came to the conclusion that she "was
deluded by an evil spirit," and recommended her to have recourse
to the fathers of the Society of Jesus, lately settled in Avila.

The Saint, now in great fear, but still hoping and trusting that
God would not suffer her to be deceived, made preparations for a
general confession; and committed to writing the whole story of
her life, and made known the state of her soul to F.  Juan de
Padranos, one of the fathers of the Society.  F. Juan understood
it all, and comforted her by telling her that her way of prayer
was sound and the work of God.  Under his direction she made
great progress, and for the further satisfaction of her
confessor, and of Don Francis, who seems to have still retained
some of his doubts, she told everything to St. Francis de Borja,
who on one point changed the method of direction observed by
F. Juan.  That father recommended her to resist the supernatural
visitations of the spirit as much as she could, but she was not
able, and the resistance pained her; [9] St. Francis told her she
had done enough, and that it was not right to prolong
that resistance. [10]

The account of her life which she wrote before she applied to the
Jesuits for direction has not been preserved; but it is possible
that it was made more for her own security than for the purpose
of being shown to her confessor.

The next account is Relation I., made for St. Peter of Alcantara,
and was probably seen by many; for that Saint had to defend her,
and maintain that the state of her soul was the work of God,
against those who thought that she was deluded by Satan.  Her own
confessor was occasionally alarmed, and had to consult others,
and thus, by degrees, her state became known to many; and there
were some who, were so persuaded of her delusions, that they
wished her to be exorcised as one possessed of an evil
spirit, [11] and at a later time her friends were afraid that she
might be denounced to the Inquisitors. [12]

During the troubles that arose when it became known that the
Saint was about to found the monastery of St. Joseph, and therein
establish the original rule of her Order in its primitive
simplicity and austerity, she went for counsel to the Father Fra
Pedro Ibañez, [13] the Dominican, a most holy and learned priest.
That father not only encouraged her, and commended her work, but
also ordered her to give him in writing the story of her
spiritual life.  The Saint readily obeyed, and began it in the
monastery of the Incarnation, and finished it in the house of
Doña Luisa de la Cerda, in Toledo, in the month of June, 1562.
On the 24th of August, the feast of St. Bartholomew, in the same
year, the Reform of the Carmelites began in the new monastery of
St. Joseph in Avila.

What the Saint wrote for Fra Ibañez has not been found.  It is,
no doubt, substantially preserved in her Life, as we have it now,
and is supposed to have reached no further than the end of
ch. xxxi.  What follows was added by direction of another
Dominican father, confessor of the Saint in the new monastery of
St. Joseph, Fra Garcia of Toledo, who, in 1562, bade her "write
the history of that foundation, and other matters."

But as the Saint carried a heavy burden laid on her by God, a
constant fear of delusion, she had recourse about the same time
to the Inquisitor Soto, who advised her to write a history of her
life, send it to Juan of Avila, the "Apostle of Andalucia," and
abide by his counsel.  As the direction of Fra Garcia of Toledo
and the advice of the Inquisitor must have been given, according
to her account, about the same time, the Life, as we have it now,
must have occupied her nearly six years in the writing of it,
which may well be owing to her unceasing care in firmly
establishing the new monastery of St. Joseph.  The book at last
was sent to Blessed Juan of Avila by her friend Doña Luisa de la
Cerda, and that great master of the spiritual life wrote the
following censure of it:

"The grace and peace of Jesus Christ be with you always.

"1. When I undertook to read the book sent me, it was not so much
because I thought myself able to judge of it, as because I
thought I might, by the grace of our Lord, learn something from
the teachings it contains: and praised be Christ; for, though I
have not been able to read it with the leisure it requires,
I have been comforted by it, and might have been edified by it,
if the fault had not been mine.  And although, indeed, I may have
been comforted by it, without saying more, yet the respect due to
the subject and to the person who has sent it will not allow me,
I think, to let it go back without giving my opinion on it, at
least in general.

"2. The book is not fit to be in the hands of everybody, for it
is necessary to correct the language in some places, and explain
it in others; and there are some things in it useful for your
spiritual life and not so for others who might adopt them, for
the special ways by which God leads some souls are not meant for
others.  These points, or the greater number of them, I have
marked for the purpose of arranging them when I shall be able to
do so, and I shall not fail to send them to you; for if you were
aware of my infirmities and necessary occupations, I believe they
would make you pity me rather than blame me for the omission.

"3. The doctrine of prayer is for the most part sound, and you
may rely on it, and observe it; and the raptures I find to
possess the tests of those which are true.  What you say of God's
way of teaching the soul, without respect to the imagination and
without interior locutions, is safe, and I find nothing to object
to it.  St. Augustine speaks well of it.

"4. Interior locutions in these days have been a delusion of
many, and exterior locutions are the least safe.  It is easy
enough to see when they proceed from ourselves, but to
distinguish between those of a good and those of an evil spirit
is more difficult.  There are many rules given for finding out
whether they come from our Lord or not, and one of them is, that
they should be sent us in a time of need, or for some good end,
as for the comforting a man under temptation or in doubt, or as a
warning of coming danger.  As a good man will not speak
unadvisedly, neither will God; so, considering this, and that the
locutions are agreeable to the holy writings and the teaching of
the Church, my opinion is that the locutions mentioned in the
book came from God.

"5. Imaginary or bodily visions are those which are most
doubtful, and should in no wise be desired, and if they come
undesired still they should be shunned as much as possible, yet
not by treating them with contempt, unless it be certain that
they come from an evil spirit; indeed, I was filled with horror,
and greatly distressed, when I read of the gestures of contempt
that were made. [14]  People ought to entreat our Lord not to
lead them by the way of visions, but to reserve for them in
Heaven the blessed vision of Himself and the saints, and to guide
them here along the beaten path as He guides His faithful
servants, and they must take other good measures for avoiding
these visions.

"6. But if the visions continue after all this is done, and if
the soul derives good from them, and if they do not lead to
vanity, but deeper humility, and if the locutions be at one with
the teaching the Church, and if they continue for any time, and
that with inward satisfaction--better felt than described--there
is no reason for avoiding them.  But no one ought to rely on his
own judgment herein; he should make everything known to him who
can give him light.  That is the universal remedy to be had
recourse to in such matters, together with hope in God, Who will
not let a soul that wishes to be safe lie under a delusion, if it
be humble enough to yield obedience to the opinion of others.

"7. Nor should any one cause alarm by condemning them forthwith,
because he sees that the person to whom they are granted is not
perfect, for it is nothing new that our Lord in His goodness
makes wicked people just, yea, even grievous sinners; by giving
them to taste most deeply of His sweetness.  I have seen it so
myself.  Who will set bounds to the goodness of our
Lord?--especially when these graces are given, not for merit, nor
because one is stronger; on the contrary, they are given to one
because he is weaker; and as they do not make one more holy, they
are not always given to the most holy.

"8. They are unreasonable who disbelieve these things merely
because they are most high things, and because it seems to them
incredible that infinite Majesty humbles Himself to these loving
relations with one of His creatures. It is written, God is love,
and if He is love, then infinite love and infinite goodness, and
we must not be surprised if such a love and such a goodness
breaks out into such excesses of love as disturb those who know
nothing of it.  And though many know of it by faith, still, as to
that special experience of the loving, and more than loving,
converse of God with whom He will, if not had, how deep it
reaches can never be known; and so I have seen many persons
scandalized at hearing of what God in His love does for His
creatures.  As they are themselves very far away from it, they
cannot think that God will do for others what He is not doing for
them.  As this is an effect of love, and that a love which causes
wonder, reason requires we should look upon it as a sign of its
being from God, seeing that He is wonderful in His works, and
most especially in those of his compassion; but they take
occasion from this to be distrustful, which should have been a
ground of confidence, when other circumstances combine as
evidences of these visitations being good.

"9. It seems from the book, I think, that you have resisted, and
even longer than was right.  I think, too, that these locutions
have done your soul good, and in particular that they have made
you see your own wretchedness and your faults more clearly, and
amend them.  They have lasted long, and always with spiritual
profit.  They move you to love God, and to despise yourself, and
to do penance.  I see no reasons for condemning them, I incline
rather to regard them as good, provided you are careful not to
rely altogether on them, especially if they are unusual, or bid
you do something out of the way, or are not very plain.  In all
these and the like cases you must withhold your belief in them,
and at once seek for direction.

"10. Also it should be considered that, even if they do come from
God, Satan may mix with them suggestions of his own; you should
therefore be always suspicious of them.  Also, when they are
known to be from God, men must not rest much on them, seeing that
holiness does not lie in them, but in a humble love of God and
our neighbour; everything else, however good, must be feared, and
our efforts directed to the gaining of humility, goodness, and
the love of our Lord.  It is seemly, also, not to worship what is
seen in these visions, but only Jesus Christ, either as in Heaven
or in the Sacrament, or, if it be a vision of the Saints, then to
lift up the heart to the Holy One in Heaven, and not to that
which is presented to the imagination: let it suffice that the
imagination may be made use of for the purpose of raising me up
to that which it makes me see.

"11. I say, too, that the things mentioned in this book befall
other persons even in this our day, and that there is great
certainty that they come from God, Whose arm is not shortened
that He cannot do now what He did in times past, and that in weak
vessels, for His own glory.

"12. Go on your road, but always suspecting robbers, and asking
for the right way; give thanks to our Lord, Who has given you His
love, the knowledge of yourself, and a love of penance and the
cross, making no account of these other things.  However, do not
despise them either, for there are signs that most of them come
from our Lord, and those that do not come from Him will not hurt
you if you ask for direction.

"13. I cannot believe that I have written this in my own
strength, for I have none, but it is the effect of your prayers.
I beg of you, for the love of Jesus Christ our Lord, to burden
yourself with a prayer for me; He knows that I am asking this in
great need, and I think that is enough to make you grant my
request.  I ask your permission to stop now, for I am bound to
write another letter.  May Jesus be glorified in all and
by all! Amen.

"Your servant, for Christ's sake.
"Juan de Avila

"Montilla, 12th Sept., 1568."

Her confessors, having seen the book, "commanded her to make
copies of it," [15] one of which has been traced into the
possession of the Duke and Duchess of Alva.

The Princess of Eboli, in 1569, obtained a copy from the Saint
herself, after much importunity; but it was more out of vanity or
curiosity, it is to be feared, than from any real desire to learn
the story of the Saint's spiritual life, that the Princess
desired the boon.  She and her husband promised to keep it from
the knowledge of others, but the promise given was not kept.
The Saint heard within a few days later that the book was in the
hands of the servants of the Princess, who was angry with the
Saint because she had refused to admit, at the request of the
Princess, an Augustinian nun into the Order of Carmel in the new
foundation of Pastrana.  The contents of the book were bruited
abroad, and the visions and revelations of the Saint were said to
be of a like nature with those of Magdalene of the Cross, a
deluded and deluding nun.  The gossip in the house of the
Princess was carried to Madrid, and the result was that the
Inquisition began to make a search for the book. [16]  It is not
quite clear, however, that it was seized at this time.

The Princess became a widow in July, 1573, and insisted on
becoming a Carmelite nun in the house she and her husband, Ruy
Gomez, had founded in Pastrana.  When the news of her resolve
reached the monastery, the mother-prioress, Isabel of St.
Dominic, exclaimed, "The Princess a nun! I look on the house as
ruined."  The Princess came, and insisted on her right as
foundress; she had compelled a friar to give her the habit before
her husband was buried, and when she came to Pastrana she began
her religious life by the most complete disobedience and
disregard of common propriety.  Don Vicente's description of her
is almost literally correct, though intended only for a general
summary of her most childish conduct:

"On the death of the Prince of Eboli, the Princess would become a
nun in her monastery of Pastrana.  The first day she had a fit of
violent fervour; on the next she relaxed the rule; on the third
she broke it, and conversed with secular people within the
cloisters.  She was also so humble that she required the nuns to
speak to her on their knees, and insisted upon their receiving
into the house as religious whomsoever she pleased.
Hereupon complaints were made to St. Teresa, who remonstrated
with the Princess, and showed her how much she was in the wrong,
whereupon she replied that the monastery was hers; but the Saint
proved to her that the nuns were not, and had them removed
to Segovia." [17]

The nuns were withdrawn from Pastrana in April, 1574, and then
the anger of the Princess prevailed; she sent the Life of the
Saint, which she had still in her possession, to the Inquisition,
and denounced it as a book containing visions, revelations, and
dangerous doctrines, which the Inquisitors should look into and
examine: The book was forthwith given to theologians for
examination, and two Dominican friars, of whom Bañes was one,
were delegated censors of it by the Inquisition. [18]

Fra Bañes did not know the Saint when he undertook her defence in
Avila against the authorities of the city, eager to destroy the
monastery of St. Joseph; [19] but from that time forth he was one
of her most faithful friends, strict and even severe, as became a
wise director who had a great Saint for his penitent.
He testifies in the process of her beatification that he was firm
and sharp with her; while she herself was the more desirous of
his counsel, the more he humbled her, and the less he appeared to
esteem her. [20]  When he found that copies of her life were in
the hands of secular people,--he had probably also heard of the
misconduct of the Princess of Eboli,--he showed his displeasure
to the Saint, and told her he would burn the book, it being
unseemly that the writings of women should be made public.
The Saint left it in his hands, but Fra Bañes, struck with her
humility, had not the courage to burn it; he sent it to the Holy
Office in Madrid. [21]  Thus the book was in a sense denounced
twice,--once by an enemy, the second time by a friend, to save
it.  Both the Saint and her confessor, Fra Bañes, state that the
copy given up by the latter was sent to the Inquisition in
Madrid, and Fra Bañes says so twice in his deposition.
The Inquisitor Soto returned the copy to Fra Bañes, desiring him
to read it, and give his opinion thereon.  Fra Bañes did so, and
wrote his "censure" of the book on the blank leaves at the end.
That censure still remains, and is one of the most important,
because given during the lifetime of the Saint, and while many
persons were crying out against her.  Bañes wished it had been
published when the Saint's Life was given to the world by Fra
Luis de Leon; but notwithstanding its value, and its being
preserved in the book which is in the handwriting of the Saint,
no one before Don Vicente made it known.  It was easy enough to
praise the writings of St. Teresa, and to admit her sanctity,
after her death.  Fra Bañes had no external help in the applause
of the many, and he had to judge the book as a theologian, and
the Saint as one of his ordinary penitents.  When he wrote, he
wrote like a man whose whole life was spent, as he tells us
himself, "in lecturing and disputing." [22]

That censure is as follows:

"1. This book, wherein Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite nun, and
foundress of the Barefooted Carmelites, gives a plain account of
the state of her soul, in order to be taught and directed by her
confessors, has been examined by me, and with much attention, and
I have not found anywhere in it anything which, in my opinion, is
erroneous in doctrine.  On the contrary, there are many things in
it highly edifying and instructive for those who give themselves
to prayer.  The great experience of this religious, her
discretion also and her humility, which made her always seek for
light and learning in her confessors, enabled her to speak with
an accuracy on the subject of prayer that the most learned men,
through their want of experience, have not always attained to.
One thing only there is about the book that may reasonably cause
any hesitation till it shall be very carefully examined;
it contains many visions and revelations, matters always to be
afraid of, especially in women, who are very ready to believe of
them that they come from God, and to look on them as proofs of
sanctity, though sanctity does not lie in them.  On the contrary,
they should be regarded as dangerous trials for those who are
aiming at perfection, because Satan is wont to transform himself
into an angel of light, [23] and to deceive souls which are
curious and of scant humility, as we have seen in our day:
nevertheless, we must not therefore lay down a general rule that
all revelations and visions come from the devil.  If it were so,
St. Paul could not have said that Satan transforms himself into
an angel of light, if the angel of light did not sometimes
enlighten us.

"2. Saints, both men and women, have had revelations, not only in
ancient, but also in modern times; such were St. Dominic,
St. Francis, St. Vincent Ferrer, St. Catherine of Siena,
St. Gertrude, and many others that might be named; and as the
Church of God is, and is to be, always holy to the end, not only
because her profession is holiness, but because there are in her
just persons and perfect in holiness, it is unreasonable to
despise visions and revelations, and condemn them in one sweep,
seeing they are ordinarily accompanied with much goodness and a
Christian life.  On the contrary, we should follow the saying of
the Apostle in 1 Thess. v. 19-22: 'Spiritum nolite extinguere.
Prophetias nolite spernere.  Omnia [autem] probate: quod bonum
est tenete.  Ab omni specie mala abstinete vos.'  He who will
read St. Thomas on that passage will see how carefully they are
to be examined who, in the Church of God, manifest any particular
gift that may be profitable or hurtful to our neighbour, and how
watchful the examiners ought to be lest the fire of the Spirit of
God should be quenched in the good, and others cowed in the
practices of the perfect Christian life.

"3. Judging by the revelations made to her, this woman, even
though she may be deceived in something, is at least not herself
a deceiver, because she tells all the good and the bad so simply,
and with so great a wish to be correct, that no doubt can be made
as to her good intention; and the greater the reason for trying
spirits of this kind, because there are persons in our day who
are deceivers with the appearance of piety, the more necessary it
is to defend those who, with the appearance, have also the
reality, of piety.  For it is a strange thing to see how lax and
worldly people delight in seeing those discredited who have an
appearance of goodness.  God complained of old, by the Prophet
Ezekiel, ch. xiii., of those false prophets who made the just to
mourn and who flattered sinners, saying: 'Maerere fecisti cor
justi mendaciter, quem Ego non contristavi: et comfortastis manus
impii.'  In a certain sense this may be said of those who
frighten souls who are going on by the way of prayer and
perfection, telling them that this way is singular and full of
danger, that many who went by it have fallen into delusions, and
that the safest way is that which is plain and common, travelled
by all.

"4. Words of this kind, clearly, sadden the hearts of those who
would observe the counsels of perfection in continual prayer, so
far as it is possible for them, and in much fasting, watching,
and disciplines; and, on the other hand, the lax and the wicked
take courage and lose the fear of God, because they consider the
way on which they are travelling as the safer: and this is their
delusion,--they call that a plain and safe road which is the
absence of the knowledge and consideration of the dangers and
precipices amidst which we are all of us journeying in this
world.  Nevertheless, there is no other security than that which
lies in our knowing our daily enemies, and in humbly imploring
the compassion of God, if we would not be their prisoners.
Besides, there are souls whom God, in a way, constrains to enter
on the way of perfection, and who, if they relaxed in their
fervour, could not keep a middle course, but would immediately
fall into the other extreme of sins, and for souls of this kind
it is of the utmost necessity that they should watch and pray
without ceasing; and, in short, there is nobody whom lukewarmness
does not injure.  Let every man examine his own conscience, and
he will find this to be the truth.

"5. I firmly believe that if God for a time bears with the
lukewarm, it is owing to the prayers of the fervent, who are
continually crying, 'et ne nos inducas in tentationem.'  I have
said this, not for the purpose of honouring those whom we see
walking in the way of contemplation; for it is another extreme
into which the world falls, and a covert persecution of goodness,
to pronounce those holy forthwith who have the appearance of it.
For that would be to furnish them with motives for vain-glory,
and would do little honour to goodness; on the contrary, it would
expose it to great risks, because, when they fall who have been
objects of praise, the honour of goodness suffers more than if
those people had not been so esteemed.  And so I look upon this
exaggeration of their holiness who are still living in the world
to be a temptation of Satan.  That we should have a good opinion
of the servants of God is most just, but let us consider them
always as people in danger, however good they may be, and that
their goodness is not so evident that we can be sure of it
even now.

"6. Considering myself that what I have said is true, I have
always proceeded cautiously in the examination of this account of
the prayer and life of this nun, and no one has been more
incredulous than myself as to her visions and revelations,--not
so, however as to her goodness and her good desires, for herein I
have had great experience of her truthfulness, her obedience,
mortification, patience, and charity towards her persecutors, and
of her other virtues, which any one who will converse with her
will discern; and this is what may be regarded as a more certain
proof of her real love of God than these visions and revelations.
I do not, however, undervalue her visions, revelations, and
ecstasies; on the contrary, I suspect them to be the work of God,
as they have been in others who were Saints.  But in this case it
is always safer to be afraid and wary; for if she is confident
about them, Satan will take occasion to interfere, and that which
was once, perhaps, the work of God, may be changed into something
else, and that will be the devil's.

"7. I am of opinion that this book is not to be shown to every
one, but only to men of learning, experience, and Christian
discretion.  It perfectly answers the purpose for which it was
written, namely, that the nun should give an account of the state
of her soul to those who had the charge of it, in order that she
might not fall into delusions.  Of one thing I am very sure, so
far as it is possible for a man to be,--she is not a deceiver;
she deserves, therefore, for her sincerity, that all should be
favourable to her in her good purposes and good works.
For within the last thirteen years she has, I believe, founded a
dozen monasteries of Barefooted Carmelite nuns, the austerity and
perfection of which are exceeded by none other; of which they who
have been visitors of them, as the Dominican Provincial, master
in theology, [24] Fra Pedro Fernandez, the master Fra Hernando
del Castillo, and many others, speak highly.  This is what I
think, at present, concerning the censure of this book,
submitting my judgment herein to that of Holy Church our mother,
and her ministers.

"Given in the College of St. Gregory, Valladolid, on the sixth
day of July, 1575.

"Fra Domingo Bañes."

The book remained in the keeping of the Inquisition, and the
Saint never saw it again.  But she heard of it from the
Archbishop of Toledo, Cardinal Quiroga, President of the Supreme
Court of the Inquisition, when she applied to him for license to
found a monastery in Madrid.  Jerome of the Mother of God was
with her; and heard the Cardinal's reply.  His Eminence said he
was glad to see her; that a book of hers had been in the Holy
Office for some years, and had been rigorously examined; that he
had read it himself, and regarded it as containing sound and
wholesome doctrine.  He would grant the license, and do whatever
he could for the Saint.  When she heard this, she wished to
present a petition to the Inquisition for the restitution of her
book; but Gratian thought it better to apply to the Duke of Alba
for the copy which he had, and which the Inquisitors had allowed
him to retain and read.  The Duke gave his book to Fra Jerome,
who had copies of it made for the use of the monasteries both of
men and women. [25]

Anne of Jesus, in 1586, founding a monastery of her Order in
Madrid,--the Saint had died in 1582,--made inquiries about the
book, and applied to the Inquisition for it, for she was resolved
to publish the writings of her spiritual mother.  The Inquisitors
made no difficulty, and consented to the publication.  In this
she was seconded by the Empress Maria, daughter of Charles V.,
and widow of Maximilian II., who had obtained one of the copies
which Fra Jerome of the Mother of God had ordered to be made.
Fra Nicholas Doria, then Provincial, asked Fra Luis de Leon, the
Augustinian, to edit the book, who consented.  He was allowed to
compare the copy furnished him with the original in the keeping
of the Inquisition; but his edition has not been considered
accurate, notwithstanding the facilities given him, and his great
reverence for the Saint. It was published in Salamanca,
A.D. 1588.

With the Life of the Saint, Fra Luis de Leon received certain
papers in the handwriting of the Saint, which he published as an
additional chapter.  Whether he printed all he received, or
merely made extracts, may be doubtful, but anyhow that chapter is
singularly incomplete.  Don Vicente de la Fuente, from whose
edition (Madrid, 1861, 1862) this translation has been made,
omitted the additional chapter of Fra Luis de Leon, contrary to
the practice of his predecessors.  But he has done more, for he
has traced the paragraphs of that chapter to their sources, and
has given us now a collection of papers which form almost another
Life of the Saint, to which he has given their old name of
Relations, [26] the name which the Saint herself had given
them. [27]  Some of them are usually printed among the Saint's
letters, and portions of some of the others are found in the
Lives of the Saint written by Ribera and Yepes, and in the
Chronicle of the Order; the rest was published for the first time
by Don Vicente: the arrangement of the whole is due to him.

The Relations are ten in the Spanish edition, and eleven in the
translation.  The last, the eleventh, has hitherto been left
among the letters, and Don Vicente, seemingly not without some
hesitation, so left it; but as it is of the like nature with the
Relations, it has now been added to them.

The original text, in the handwriting of the Saint, is preserved
in the Escurial, not in the library, but among the relics of the
Church.  Don Vicente examined it at his leisure, and afterwards
found in the National Library in Madrid an authentic and exact
transcript of it, made by order of Ferdinand VI.  His edition is,
therefore, far better than any of its predecessors; but it is
possible that even now there may still remain some verbal errors
for future editors to correct.  The most conscientious diligence
is not a safeguard against mistakes.  F. Bouix says that in
ch. xxxiv. § 12, the reading of the original differs from that of
the printed editions; yet Don Vicente takes no notice of it, and
retains the common reading. It is impossible to believe that
F. Bouix has stated as a fact that which is not.  Again, in
ch. xxxix. § 29, the printed editions have after the words, "Thou
art Mine, and I am thine," "I am in the habit . . . . sincerity;"
but Don Vicente omits them.  This may have been an oversight, for
in general he points out in his notes all the discrepancies
between the printed editions and the original text.

A new translation of the Life of St. Teresa seems called for now,
because the original text has been collated since the previous
translations were made, and also because those translations are
exceedingly scarce.  The first is believed to be this--it is a
small quarto:

"The Lyf of the Mother Teresa of Jesus, Foundresse of the
Monasteries of the Discalced or Bare-footed Carmelite Nunnes and
Fryers of the First Rule.
"Written by herself at the commaundement of her ghostly father,
and now translated into English out of Spanish.  By W.M., of the
Society of Jesus.
"Imprinted in Antwerp by Henry Jaye.  Anno MDCXI."

Some thirty years afterwards, Sir Tobias Matthew, S.J.,
dissatisfied, as he says, with the former translation, published
another, with the following title; the volume is a small octavo
in form:

"The Flaming Hart, or the Life of the glorious St. Teresa,
Foundresse of the Reformation of the Order of the All-Immaculate
Virgin Mother, our B. Lady of Mount Carmel.
"This History of her Life was written by the Saint in Spanish,
and is newly translated into English in the year of our Lord
God 1642.

'Aut mori aut pati:
Either to dye or else to suffer.'--Chap. xl.

"Antwerpe, printed by Joannes Meursius.  Anno MDCXLII."

The next translation was made by Abraham Woodhead, and published
in 1671, without the name of the translator, or of the printer,
or of the place of publication.  It is in quarto, and bears the
following title:

"The Life of the Holy Mother St. Teresa, Foundress of the
Reformation of the Discalced Carmelites according to the
Primitive Rule.  Printed in the year MDCLXXI."

It is not said that the translation was made from the Spanish,
and there are grounds for thinking it to have been made from the
Italian.  Ch. xxxii. is broken off at the end of § 10; and
ch. xxxiii., therefore, is ch. xxxvii.  That which is there
omitted has been thrown into the Book of the Foundations, which,
in the translation of Mr. Woodhead, begins with § 11 of
ch. xxxii. of the Life, as it also does in the Italian
translation. It is due, however, to Mr. Woodhead to say that he
has printed five of the Relations separately, not as letters, but
as what they really are, and with that designation.

The last translation is that of the Very Reverend John Dalton,
Canon of Northampton, which is now, though twice published,
almost as scarce as its predecessors.  The title is:

"The Life of St. Teresa, written by herself, and translated
from the Spanish by the Rev. John Dalton.  London, MDCCCLI."

Annals of the Saint's Life.

By Don Vicente de la Fuente.

These are substantially the same with those drawn up by the
Bollandists, but they are fuller and more minute, and furnish a
more detailed history of the Saint.


1515.  St. Teresa is born in Avila, March 28th. [1]

1522.  She desires martyrdom, and leaves her father's house with
one of her brothers.

1. In the same year St. Philip was born in Florence.  St. Teresa
died in 1582, and St. Philip in 1595; but they were canonised on
the same day, with St. Isidore, St. Ignatius, and St. Francis
Xavier.  The three latter were joined together in the three final
consistories held before the solemn proclamation of their
sanctity, and St. Teresa and St. Philip were joined together in
the same way in the final consistories held specially, as usual,
for them.

2. This must be an error.  See ch. i. § 7, note 7.

3. There is a difficulty about this.  The Bollandists maintain
that she went to the monastery of the Incarnation in the year
1533.  On the other hand Ribera, her most accurate
biographer--with whom Fra Jerome agrees,--says that she left her
father's house in 1535, when she was more than twenty years of
age; Yepes, that she was not yet twenty; and the Second Relation
of the Rota, that she was in her twentieth year.  The Bull of
Canonisation and the Office in the Breviary also say that she was
in her twentieth year, that is, A.D. 1534.  The Chronicler of the
Order differs from all and assigns the year 1536 as the year in
which she entered the monastery.

Prologue.


As I have been commanded and left at liberty to describe at
length my way of prayer, and the workings of the grace of our
Lord within me, I could wish that I had been allowed at the same
time to speak distinctly and in detail of my grievous sins and
wicked life.  But it has not been so willed; on the contrary, I
am laid herein under great restraint; and therefore, for the love
of our Lord, I beg of every one who shall read this story of my
life [1] to keep in mind how wicked it has been; and how, among
the Saints who were converted to God, I have never found one in
whom I can have any comfort.  For I see that they, after our Lord
had called them, never fell into sin again; I not only became
worse, but, as it seems to me, deliberately withstood the graces
of His Majesty, because I saw that I was thereby bound to serve
Him more earnestly, knowing, at the same time, that of myself I
could not pay the least portion of my debt.

May He be blessed for ever Who waited for me so long! I implore
Him with my whole heart to send me His grace, so that in all
clearness and truth I may give this account of myself which my
confessors command me to give; and even our Lord Himself, I know
it, has also willed it should be given for some time past, but I
had not the courage to attempt it.  And I pray it may be to His
praise and glory, and a help to my confessors; who, knowing me
better, may succour my weakness, so that I may render to our Lord
some portion of the service I owe Him.  May all creatures praise
Him for ever! Amen.


1. The Saint, in a letter written November 19, 1581, to Don Pedro
de Castro, then canon of Avila, speaking of this book, calls it
the book "Of the compassions of God"--Y ansi intitule ese libro
De las Misericordias de Dios.  That letter is the 358th in the
edition of Don Vicente de la Fuente, and the 8th of the fourth
volume of the Doblado edition of Madrid.  "Vitam igitur suam
internam et supernaturalem magis pandit quam narrat actiones
suas mere humanas" (Bollandists, n. 2).



Chapter I.


Childhood and Early Impressions.  The Blessing of Pious Parents.
Desire of Martyrdom.  Death of the Saint's Mother.


1. I had a father and mother, who were devout and feared God.
Our Lord also helped me with His grace.  All this would have been
enough to make me good, if I had not been so wicked.  My father
was very much given to the reading of good books; and so he had
them in Spanish, that his children might read them.  These books,
with my mother's carefulness to make us say our prayers, and to
bring us up devout to our Lady and to certain Saints, began to
make me think seriously when I was, I believe, six or seven years
old.  It helped me, too, that I never saw my father and mother
respect anything but goodness.  They were very good themselves.
My father was a man of great charity towards the poor, and
compassion for the sick, and also for servants; so much so, that
he never could be persuaded to keep slaves, for he pitied them so
much: and a slave belonging to one of his brothers being once in
his house, was treated by him with as much tenderness as his own
children.  He used to say that he could not endure the pain of
seeing that she was not free.  He was a man of great
truthfulness; nobody ever heard him swear or speak ill of any
one; his life was most pure.

2. My mother also was a woman of great goodness, and her life was
spent in great infirmities.  She was singularly pure in all her
ways.  Though possessing great beauty, yet was it never known
that she gave reason to suspect that she made any account
whatever of it; for, though she was only three-and-thirty years
of age when she died, her apparel was already that of a woman
advanced in years.  She was very calm, and had great sense.
The sufferings she went through during her life were grievous,
her death most Christian. [1]

3. We were three sisters and nine brothers. [2]  All, by the
mercy of God, resembled their parents in goodness except myself,
though I was the most cherished of my father.  And, before I
began to offend God, I think he had some reason,--for I am filled
with sorrow whenever I think of the good desires with which our
Lord inspired me, and what a wretched use I made of them.
Besides, my brothers never in any way hindered me in the service
of God.

4. One of my brothers was nearly of my own age; [3] and he it was
whom I most loved, though I was very fond of them all, and they
of me.  He and I used to read Lives of Saints together.  When I
read of martyrdom undergone by the Saints for the love of God, it
struck me that the vision of God was very cheaply purchased; and
I had a great desire to die a martyr's death,--not out of any
love of Him of which I was conscious, but that I might most
quickly attain to the fruition of those great joys of which I
read that they were reserved in Heaven; and I used to discuss
with my brother how we could become martyrs.  We settled to go
together to the country of the Moors, [4] begging our way for the
love of God, that we might be there beheaded; [5] and our Lord, I
believe, had given us courage enough, even at so tender an age,
if we could have found the means to proceed; but our greatest
difficulty seemed to be our father and mother.

5. It astonished us greatly to find it said in what we were
reading that pain and bliss were everlasting.  We happened very
often to talk about this; and we had a pleasure in repeating
frequently, "For ever, ever, ever."  Through the constant
uttering of these words, our Lord was pleased that I should
receive an abiding impression of the way of truth when I was yet
a child.

6. As soon as I saw it was impossible to go to any place where
people would put me to death for the sake of God, my brother and
I set about becoming hermits; and in an orchard belonging to the
house we contrived, as well as we could, to build hermitages, by
piling up small stones one on the other, which fell down
immediately; and so it came to pass that we found no means of
accomplishing our wish.  Even now, I have a feeling of devotion
when I consider how God gave me in my early youth what I lost by
my own fault.  I gave alms as I could--and I could but little.
I contrived to be alone, for the sake of saying my
prayers [6]--and they were many--especially the Rosary, to which
my mother had a great devotion, and had made us also in this like
herself.  I used to delight exceedingly, when playing with other
children, in the building of monasteries, as if we were nuns; and
I think I wished to be a nun, though not so much as I did to be a
martyr or a hermit.

7. I remember that, when my mother died, [7] I was about twelve
years old--a little less.  When I began to understand my loss, I
went in my affliction to an image of our Lady, [8] and with many
tears implored her to be my mother.  I did this in my simplicity,
and I believe that it was of service to me; for I have by
experience found the royal Virgin help me whenever I recommended
myself to her; and at last she has brought me back to herself.
It distresses me now, when I think of, and reflect on, that which
kept me from being earnest in the good desires with which
I began.

8. O my Lord, since Thou art determined to save me--may it be the
pleasure of Thy Majesty to effect it!--and to bestow upon me so
many graces, why has it not been Thy pleasure also--not for my
advantage, but for Thy greater honour--that this habitation,
wherein Thou hast continually to dwell, should not have
contracted so much defilement?  It distresses me even to say
this, O my Lord, because I know the fault is all my own, seeing
that Thou hast left nothing undone to make me, even from my
youth, wholly Thine.  When I would complain of my parents, I
cannot do it; for I saw nothing in them but all good, and
carefulness for my welfare.  Then, growing up, I began to
discover the natural gifts which our Lord had given me--they were
said to be many; and, when I should have given Him thanks for
them, I made use of every one of them, as I shall now explain, to
offend Him.


1. See ch. xxxvii. § 1; where the Saint says that she saw them in
a vision both in Heaven.

2. Alfonso Sanchez de Cepeda, father of the Saint, married first
Catalina del Peso y Henao, and had three children--one daughter,
Maria de Cepeda, and two sons.  After the death of Catalina, he
married Beatriz Davila y Ahumada, by whom he had nine
children--seven boys and two girls.  The third of these, and the
eldest of the daughters, was the Saint, Doña Teresa Sanchez
Cepeda Davila y Ahumada.  In the Monastery of the Incarnation,
where she was a professed nun for twenty-eight years, she was
known as Doña Teresa; but in the year 1563, when she left her
monastery for the new foundation of St. Joseph, of the Reform of
the Carmelites, she took for the first time the name of Teresa of
Jesus (De la Fuente).  The Saint was born March 28, 1515, and
baptized on the 4th of April, in the church of St. John; on which
day Mass was said for the first time in the Monastery of the
Incarnation, where the Saint made her profession.  Her godfather
was Vela Nuñez, and her godmother Doña Maria del Aguila.
The Bollandists and Father Bouix say that she was baptized on the
very day of her birth.  But the testimony of Doña Maria de Pinel,
a nun in the Monastery of the Incarnation, is clear: and Don
Vicente de La Fuente, quoting it, vol. i. p. 549, says that this
delay of baptism was nothing singular in those days, provided
there was no danger of death.

3. Rodrigo de Cepeda, four years older than the Saint, entered
the army, and, serving in South America, was drowned in the river
Plate, Rio de la Plata.  St. Teresa always considered him a
martyr, because he died in defence of the Catholic faith (Ribera,
lib. i. ch. iii.).  Before he sailed for the Indies, he made his
will, and left all his property to the Saint, his sister (Reforma
de los Descalços, vol. i. lib. i. ch. iii. § 4).

4. The Bollandists incline to believe that St. Teresa may not
have intended to quit Spain, because all the Moors were not at
that time driven out of the country.  The Bull of the Saint's
canonization, and the Lections of the Breviary, say that she left
her father's house, ut in Africam trajiceret.

5. The two children set out on their strange journey--one of them
seven, the other eleven, years old--through the Adaja Gate; but
when they had crossed the bridge, they were met by one of their
uncles, who brought them back to their mother, who had already
sent through Avila in quest of them.  Rodrigo, like Adam, excused
himself, and laid the blame on the woman (Ribera,
lib. i. ch. iii.).  Francisco de Santa Maria, chronicler of the
Order, says that the uncle was Francisco Alvarez de Cepeda
(Reforma de los Descalços, lib. i. ch. v. § 4).

6. She was also marvellously touched by the story of the
Samaritan woman at the well, of whom there was a picture in her
room (Ribera, lib. i. ch. iv.).  She speaks of this later on.
(See ch. xxx. § 24.)

7. The last will and testament of Doña Beatriz de Ahumada was
made November 24, 1528 and she may have died soon after.
If there be no mistake in the copy of that instrument, the Saint
must have been more than twelve years old at that time.
Don Vicente, in a note, says, with the Bollandists, that Doña
Beatriz died at the end of the year 1526, or in the beginning of
1527; but it is probable that, when he wrote that note, he had
not read the copy of the will, which he has printed in the first
volume of the Saint's writings, p. 550.

8. Our Lady of Charity, in the church of the hospital where
the poor and pilgrims were received in Avila (Bouix).



Chapter II.


Early Impressions.  Dangerous Books and Companions.  The Saint Is
Placed in a Monastery.


1. What I shall now speak of was, I believe, the beginning of
great harm to me.  I often think how wrong it is of parents not
to be very careful that their children should always, and in
every way, see only that which is good; for though my mother was,
as I have just said, so good herself, nevertheless I, when I came
to the use of reason, did not derive so much good from her as I
ought to have done--almost none at all; and the evil I learned
did me much harm.  She was very fond of books of chivalry; but
this pastime did not hurt her so much as it hurt me, because she
never wasted her time on them; only we, her children, were left
at liberty to read them; and perhaps she did this to distract her
thoughts from her great sufferings, and occupy her children, that
they might not go astray in other ways.  It annoyed my father so
much, that we had to be careful he never saw us.  I contracted a
habit of reading these books; and this little fault which I
observed in my mother was the beginning of lukewarmness in my
good desires, and the occasion of my falling away in other
respects.  I thought there was no harm in it when I wasted many
hours night and day in so vain an occupation, even when I kept it
a secret from my father.  So completely was I mastered by this
passion, that I thought I could never be happy without a
new book.

2. I began to make much of dress, to wish to please others by my
appearance.  I took pains with my hands and my hair, used
perfumes, and all vanities within my reach--and they were many,
for I was very much given to them.  I had no evil intention,
because I never wished any one to offend God for me.
This fastidiousness of excessive neatness [1] lasted some years;
and so also did other practices, which I thought then were not at
all sinful; now, I see how wrong all this must have been.

3. I had some cousins; for into my father's house no others were
allowed an entrance.  In this he was very cautious; and would to
God he had been cautious about them!--for I see now the danger of
conversing, at an age when virtue should begin to grow, with
persons who, knowing nothing themselves of the vanity of the
world, provoke others to throw themselves into the midst of it.
These cousins were nearly of mine own age--a little older,
perhaps.  We were always together; and they had a great affection
for me.  In everything that gave them pleasure, I kept the
conversation alive,--listened to the stories of their affections
and childish follies, good for nothing; and, what was still
worse, my soul began to give itself up to that which was the
cause of all its disorders.  If I were to give advice, I would
say to parents that they ought to be very careful whom they allow
to mix with their children when young; for much mischief thence
ensues, and our natural inclinations are unto evil rather than
unto good.

4. So it was with me; for I had a sister much older than
myself, [2] from whose modesty and goodness, which were great, I
learned nothing; and learned every evil from a relative who was
often in the house.  She was so light and frivolous, that my
mother took great pains to keep her out of the house, as if she
foresaw the evil I should learn from her; but she could not
succeed, there being so many reasons for her coming.  I was very
fond of this person's company, gossiped and talked with her; for
she helped me in all the amusements I liked, and, what is more,
found some for me, and communicated to me her own conversations
and her vanities.  Until I knew her, I mean, until she became
friendly with me, and communicated to me her own affairs--I was
then about fourteen years old, a little more, I think--I do not
believe that I turned away from God in mortal sin, or lost the
fear of Him, though I had a greater fear of disgrace.
This latter fear had such sway over me, that I never wholly
forfeited my good name--and, as to that, there was nothing in the
world for which I would have bartered it, and nobody in the world
I liked well enough who could have persuaded me to do it.  Thus I
might have had the strength never to do anything against the
honour of God, as I had it by nature not to fail in that wherein
I thought the honour of the world consisted; and I never observed
that I was failing in many other ways.  In vainly seeking after
it I was extremely careful; but in the use of the means necessary
for preserving it I was utterly careless. I was anxious only not
to be lost altogether.

5. This friendship distressed my father and sister exceedingly.
They often blamed me for it; but, as they could not hinder that
person from coming into the house, all their efforts were in
vain; for I was very adroit in doing anything that was wrong.
Now and then, I am amazed at the evil one bad companion can
do,--nor could I believe it if I did not know it by
experience,--especially when we are young: then is it that the
evil must be greatest.  Oh, that parents would take warning by
me, and look carefully to this! So it was; the conversation of
this person so changed me, that no trace was left of my soul's
natural disposition to virtue, and I became a reflection of her
and of another who was given to the same kind of amusements.

6. I know from this the great advantage of good companions; and I
am certain that if at that tender age I had been thrown among
good people, I should have persevered in virtue; for if at that
time I had found any one to teach me the fear of God, my soul
would have grown strong enough not to fall away. Afterwards, when
the fear of God had utterly departed from me, the fear of
dishonour alone remained, and was a torment to me in all I did.
When I thought that nobody would ever know, I ventured upon many
things that were neither honourable nor pleasing unto God.

7. In the beginning, these conversations did me harm--I believe
so.  The fault was perhaps not hers, but mine; for afterwards my
own wickedness was enough to lead me astray, together with the
servants about me, whom I found ready enough for all evil.
If any one of these had given me good advice, I might perhaps
have profited by it; but they were blinded by interest, as I was
by passion.  Still, I was never inclined to much evil,--for I
hated naturally anything dishonourable,--but only to the
amusement of a pleasant conversation.  The occasion of sin,
however, being present, danger was at hand, and I exposed to it
my father and brothers.  God delivered me out of it all, so that
I should not be lost, in a manner visibly against my will, yet
not so secretly as to allow me to escape without the loss of my
good name and the suspicions of my father.

8. I had not spent, I think, three months in these vanities, when
they took me to a monastery [3] in the city where I lived, in
which children like myself were brought up, though their way of
life was not so wicked as mine.  This was done with the utmost
concealment of the true reason, which was known only to myself
and one of my kindred.  They waited for an opportunity which
would make the change seem nothing out of the way; for, as my
sister was married, it was not fitting I should remain alone,
without a mother, in the house.

9. So excessive was my father's love for me, and so deep my
dissembling, that he never would believe me to be so wicked as I
was; and hence I was never in disgrace with him.  Though some
remarks were made, yet, as the time had been short, nothing could
be positively asserted; and, as I was so much afraid about my
good name, I had taken every care to be secret; and yet I never
considered that I could conceal nothing from Him Who seeth all
things.  O my God, what evil is done in the world by disregarding
this, and thinking that anything can be kept secret that is done
against Thee!  I am quite certain that great evils would be
avoided if we clearly understood that what we have to do is, not
to be on our guard against men, but on our guard against
displeasing Thee.

10. For the first eight days, I suffered much; but more from the
suspicion that my vanity was known, than from being in the
monastery; for I was already weary of myself--and, though I
offended God, I never ceased to have a great fear of Him, and
contrived to go to confession as quickly as I could.  I was very
uncomfortable; but within eight days, I think sooner, I was much
more contented than I had been in my father's house.  All the
nuns were pleased with me; for our Lord had given me the grace to
please every one, wherever I might be.  I was therefore made much
of in the monastery.  Though at this time I hated to be a nun,
yet I was delighted at the sight of nuns so good; for they were
very good in that house--very prudent, observant of the rule,
and recollected.

11. Yet, for all this, the devil did not cease to tempt me; and
people in the world sought means to trouble my rest with messages
and presents.  As this could not be allowed, it was soon over,
and my soul began to return to the good habits of my earlier
years; and I recognized the great mercy of God to those whom He
places among good people.  It seems as if His Majesty had sought
and sought again how to convert me to Himself.  Blessed be Thou,
O Lord, for having borne with me so long!  Amen.

12. Were it not for my many faults, there was some excuse for me,
I think, in this: that the conversation I shared in was with one
who, I thought, would do well in the estate of matrimony; [4] and
I was told by my confessors, and others also, whom in many points
I consulted, used to say, that I was not offending God.  One of
the nuns [5] slept with us who were seculars, and through her it
pleased our Lord to give me light, as I shall now explain.


1. The Saint throughout her life was extremely careful of
cleanliness.  In one of her letters to Father Jerome Gratian of
the Mother of God (No. 323, Letter 28, vol. iii. ed. Doblado),
she begs him, for the love of God, to see that the Fathers had
clean cells and table; and the Ven. Mother Anne of
St. Bartholomew, in her life (Bruxelles, 1708, p. 40), says that
she changed the Saint's linen on the day of her death, and was
thanked by her for her carefulness.  "Her soul was so pure," says
the Ven. Mother, "that she could not bear anything that was
not clean."

2. Maria de Cepeda, half-sister of the Saint.  She was married to
Don Martin de Guzman y Barrientos; and the contract for the dowry
was signed January 11, 1531 (Reforma de los Descalços
lib. i. ch. vii. § 4).

3. The Augustinian Monastery of Our Lady of Grace.  It was
founded in 1509 by the venerable Fra Juan of Seville,
Vicar-General of the Order (Reforma de los Descalços
lib. i. ch. vii. n. 2).  There were forty nuns in the house at
this time (De la Fuente).

4. Some have said that the Saint at this time intended, or
wished, to be married; and Father Bouix translates the passage
thus: "une alliance honorable pour moi."  But it is more probable
that the Saint had listened only to the story of her cousin's
intended marriage; for in ch. v. § 11, she says that our Lord had
always kept her from seeking to be loved of men.

5. Doña Maria Brizeño, mistress of the secular children who were
educated in the monastery (Reforma, lib. i. ch. vii. § 3).



Chapter III.


The Blessing of Being with Good People.  How Certain Illusions
Were Removed.


1. I began gradually to like the good and holy conversation of
this nun.  How well she used to speak of God! for she was a
person of great discretion and sanctity.  I listened to her with
delight.  I think there never was a time when I was not glad to
listen to her.  She began by telling me how she came to be a nun
through the mere reading of the words of the Gospel "Many are
called, and few are chosen." [1]  She would speak of the reward
which our Lord gives to those who forsake all things for His
sake.  This good companionship began to root out the habits which
bad companionship had formed, and to bring my thoughts back to
the desire of eternal things, as well as to banish in some
measure the great dislike I had to be a nun, which had been very
great; and if I saw any one weep in prayer, or devout in any
other way, I envied her very much; for my heart was now so hard,
that I could not shed a tear, even if I read the Passion through.
This was a grief to me.

2. I remained in the monastery a year and a half, and was very
much the better for it.  I began to say many vocal prayers, and
to ask all the nuns to pray for me, that God would place me in
that state wherein I was to serve Him; but, for all this, I
wished not to be a nun, and that God would not be pleased I
should be one, though at the same time I was afraid of marriage.
At the end of my stay there, I had a greater inclination to be a
nun, yet not in that house, on account of certain devotional
practices which I understood prevailed there, and which I thought
overstrained.  Some of the younger ones encouraged me in this my
wish; and if all had been of one mind, I might have profited by
it.  I had also a great friend [2] in another monastery; and this
made me resolve, if I was to be a nun, not to be one in any other
house than where she was.  I looked more to the pleasure of sense
and vanity than to the good of my soul.  These good thoughts of
being a nun came to me from time to time.  They left me very
soon; and I could not persuade myself to become one.

3. At this time, though I was not careless about my own good, our
Lord was much more careful to dispose me for that state of life
which was best for me.  He sent me a serious illness, so that I
was obliged to return to my father's house.

4. When I became well again, they took me to see my sister [3] in
her house in the country village where she dwelt. Her love for me
was so great, that, if she had had her will, I should never have
left her.  Her husband also had a great affection for me--at
least, he showed me all kindness.  This too I owe rather to our
Lord, for I have received kindness everywhere; and all my service
in return is, that I am what I am.

5. On the road lived a brother of my father [4]--a prudent and
most excellent man, then a widower.  Him too our Lord was
preparing for Himself.  In his old age, he left all his
possessions and became a religious.  He so finished his course,
that I believe him to have the vision of God.  He would have me
stay with him some days.  His practice was to read good books in
Spanish; and his ordinary conversation was about God and the
vanity of the world.  These books he made me read to him; and,
though I did not much like them, I appeared as if I did; for in
giving pleasure to others I have been most particular, though it
might be painful to myself--so much so, that what in others might
have been a virtue was in me a great fault, because I was often
extremely indiscreet.  O my God, in how many ways did His Majesty
prepare me for the state wherein it was His will I should serve
Him!--how, against my own will, He constrained me to do violence
to myself!  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.

6. Though I remained here but a few days, yet, through the
impression made on my heart by the words of God both heard and
read, and by the good conversation of my uncle, I came to
understand the truth I had heard in my childhood, that all things
are as nothing, the world vanity, and passing rapidly away.
I also began to be afraid that, if I were then to die, I should
go down to hell.  Though I could not bend my will to be a nun, I
saw that the religious state was the best and the safest.
And thus, by little and little, I resolved to force myself
into it.

7. The struggle lasted three months.  I used to press this reason
against myself: The trials and sufferings of living as a nun
cannot be greater than those of purgatory, and I have well
deserved to be in hell.  It is not much to spend the rest of my
life as if I were in purgatory, and then go straight to
Heaven--which was what I desired.  I was more influenced by
servile fear, I think, than by love, to enter religion.

8. The devil put before me that I could not endure the trials of
the religious life, because of my delicate nurture.  I defended
myself against him by alleging the trials which Christ endured,
and that it was not much for me to suffer something for His sake;
besides, He would help me to bear it.  I must have thought so,
but I do not remember this consideration.  I endured many
temptations during these days.  I was subject to fainting-fits,
attended with fever,--for my health was always weak.  I had
become by this time fond of good books, and that gave me life.
I read the Epistles of St. Jerome, which filled me with so much
courage, that I resolved to tell my father of my purpose,--which
was almost like taking the habit; for I was so jealous of my
word, that I would never, for any consideration, recede from a
promise when once my word had been given.

9. My father's love for me was so great, that I could never
obtain his consent; nor could the prayers of others, whom I
persuaded to speak to him, be of any avail.  The utmost I could
get from him was that I might do as I pleased after his death.
I now began to be afraid of myself, and of my own weakness--for I
might go back.  So, considering that such waiting was not safe
for me, I obtained my end in another way, as I shall now relate.

Chapter IV.


Our Lord Helps Her to Become a Nun.  Her Many Infirmities.


1. In those days, when I was thus resolved, I had persuaded one
of my brothers, [1] by speaking to him of the vanity of the
world, to become a friar; and we agreed together to set out one
day very early in the morning for the monastery where that friend
of mine lived for whom I had so great an affection: [2] though I
would have gone to any other monastery, if I thought I should
serve God better in it, or to any one my father liked, so strong
was my resolution now to become a nun--for I thought more of the
salvation of my soul now, and made no account whatever of mine
own ease.  I remember perfectly well, and it is quite true, that
the pain I felt when I left my father's house was so great, that
I do not believe the pain of dying will be greater--for it seemed
to me as if every bone in my body were wrenched asunder; [3] for,
as I had no love of God to destroy my love of father and of
kindred, this latter love came upon me with a violence so great
that, if our Lord had not been my keeper, my own resolution to go
on would have failed me.  But He gave me courage to fight against
myself, so that I executed my purpose. [4]

2. When I took the habit, [5] our Lord at once made me understand
how He helps those who do violence to themselves in order to
serve Him.  No one observed this violence in me; they saw nothing
but the greatest good will.  At that moment, because I was
entering on that state, I was filled with a joy so great, that it
has never failed me to this day; and God converted the aridity of
my soul into the greatest tenderness.  Everything in religion was
a delight unto me; and it is true that now and then I used to
sweep the house during those hours of the day which I had
formerly spent on my amusements and my dress; and, calling to
mind that I was delivered from such follies, I was filled with a
new joy that surprised me, nor could I understand whence it came.

3. Whenever I remember this, there is nothing in the world,
however hard it may be, that, if it were proposed to me, I would
not undertake without any hesitation whatever; for I know now, by
experience in many things, that if from the first I resolutely
persevere in my purpose, even in this life His Majesty rewards it
in a way which he only understands who has tried it.  When the
act is done for God only, it is His will before we begin it that
the soul, in order to the increase of its merits, should be
afraid; and the greater the fear, if we do but succeed, the
greater the reward, and the sweetness thence afterwards
resulting.  I know this by experience, as I have just said, in
many serious affairs; and so, if I were a person who had to
advise anybody, I would never counsel any one, to whom good
inspirations from time to time may come, to resist them through
fear of the difficulty of carrying them into effect; for if a
person lives detached for the love of God only, that is no reason
for being afraid of failure, for He is omnipotent.  May He be
blessed for ever!  Amen.

4. O supreme Good, and my Rest, those graces ought to have been
enough which Thou hadst given me hitherto, seeing that Thy
compassion and greatness had drawn me through so many windings to
a state so secure, to a house where there are so many servants of
God, from whom I might learn how I may advance in Thy service.
I know not how to go on, when I call to mind the circumstances of
my profession, the great resolution and joy with which I made it,
and my betrothal unto Thee.  I cannot speak of it without tears;
and my tears ought to be tears of blood, my heart ought to break,
and that would not be much to suffer because of the many offences
against Thee which I have committed since that day.  It seems to
me now that I had good reasons for not wishing for this dignity,
seeing that I have made so sad a use of it.  But Thou, O my Lord,
hast been willing to bear with me for almost twenty years of my
evil using of Thy graces, till I might become better.  It seems
to me, O my God, that I did nothing but promise never to keep any
of the promises then made to Thee.  Yet such was not my
intention: but I see that what I have done since is of such a
nature, that I know not what my intention was.  So it was and so
it happened, that it may be the better known, O my Bridegroom,
Who Thou art and what I am.

5. It is certainly true that very frequently the joy I have in
that the multitude of Thy mercies is made known in me, softens
the bitter sense of my great faults.  In whom, O Lord, can they
shine forth as they do in me, who by my evil deeds have shrouded
in darkness Thy great graces, which Thou hadst begun to work in
me?  Woe is me, O my Maker!  If I would make an excuse, I have
none to offer; and I only am to blame.  For if I could return to
Thee any portion of that love which Thou hadst begun to show unto
me, I would give it only unto Thee, and then everything would
have been safe.  But, as I have not deserved this, nor been so
happy as to have done it, let Thy mercy, O Lord, rest upon me.

6. The change in the habits of my life, and in my food, proved
hurtful to my health; and though my happiness was great, that was
not enough.  The fainting-fits began to be more frequent; and my
heart was so seriously affected, that every one who saw it was
alarmed; and I had also many other ailments.  And thus it was I
spent the first year, having very bad health, though I do not
think I offended God in it much.  And as my illness was so
serious--I was almost insensible at all times, and frequently
wholly so--my father took great pains to find some relief; and as
the physicians who attended me had none to give, he had me taken
to a place which had a great reputation for the cure of other
infirmities.  They said I should find relief there. [6]
That friend of whom I have spoken as being in the house went with
me. She was one of the elder nuns.  In the house where I was a
nun, there was no vow of enclosure. [7]

7. I remained there nearly a year, for three months of it
suffering most cruel tortures--effects of the violent remedies
which they applied.  I know not how I endured them; and indeed,
though I submitted myself to them, they were, as I shall
relate, [8] more than my constitution could bear.

8. I was to begin the treatment in the spring, and went thither
when winter commenced.  The intervening time I spent with my
sister, of whom I spoke before, [9] in her house in the country,
waiting for the month of April, which was drawing near, that I
might not have to go and return.  The uncle of whom I have made
mention before, [10] and whose house was on our road, gave me a
book called Tercer Abecedario, [11] which treats of the prayer of
recollection.  Though in the first year I had read good
books--for I would read no others, because I understood now the
harm they had done me--I did not know how to make my prayer, nor
how to recollect myself.  I was therefore much pleased with the
book, and resolved to follow the way of prayer it described with
all my might.  And as our Lord had already bestowed upon me the
gift of tears, and I found pleasure in reading, I began to spend
a certain time in solitude, to go frequently to confession, and
make a beginning of that way of prayer, with this book for my
guide; for I had no master--I mean, no confessor--who understood
me, though I sought for such a one for twenty years afterwards:
which did me much harm, in that I frequently went backwards, and
might have been even utterly lost; for, anyhow, a director would
have helped me to escape the risks I ran of sinning against God.

9. From the very beginning, God was most gracious unto me.
Though I was not so free from sin as the book required, I passed
that by; such watchfulness seemed to me almost impossible.  I was
on my guard against mortal sin--and would to God I had always
been so!--but I was careless about venial sins, and that was my
ruin.  Yet, for all this, at the end of my stay there--I spent
nearly nine months in the practice of solitude--our Lord began to
comfort me so much in this way of prayer, as in His mercy to
raise me to the prayer of quiet, and now and then to that of
union, though I understood not what either the one or the other
was, nor the great esteem I ought to have had of them.  I believe
it would have been a great blessing to me if I had understood the
matter.  It is true that the prayer of union lasted but a short
time: I know not if it continued for the space of an Ave Maria;
but the fruits of it remained; and they were such that, though I
was then not twenty years of age, I seemed to despise the world
utterly; and so I remember how sorry I was for those who followed
its ways, though only in things lawful.

10. I used to labour with all my might to imagine Jesus Christ,
our Good and our Lord, present within me.  And this was the way I
prayed.  If I meditated on any mystery of His life, I represented
it to myself as within me, though the greater part of my time I
spent in reading good books, which was all my comfort; for God
never endowed me with the gift of making reflections with the
understanding, or with that of using the imagination to any good
purpose: my imagination is so sluggish, [12] that even if I would
think of, or picture to myself, as I used to labour to picture,
our Lord's Humanity, I never could do it.

11. And though men may attain more quickly to the state of
contemplation, if they persevere, by this way of inability to
exert the intellect, yet is the process more laborious and
painful; for if the will have nothing to occupy it, and if love
have no present object to rest on, the soul is without support
and without employment--its isolation and dryness occasion great
pain, and the thoughts assail it most grievously.  Persons in
this condition must have greater purity of conscience than those
who can make use of their understanding; for he who can use his
intellect in the way of meditation on what the world is, on what
he owes to God, on the great sufferings of God for him, his own
scanty service in return, and on the reward God reserves for
those who love Him, learns how to defend himself against his own
thoughts, and against the occasions and perils of sin.  On the
other hand, he who has not that power is in greater danger, and
ought to occupy himself much in reading, seeing that he is not in
the slightest degree able to help himself.

12. This way of proceeding is so exceedingly painful, that if the
master who teaches it insists on cutting off the succours which
reading gives, and requires the spending of much time in prayer,
then, I say, it will be impossible to persevere long in it: and
if he persists in his plan, health will be ruined, because it is
a most painful process.  Reading is of great service towards
procuring recollection in any one who proceeds in this way; and
it is even necessary for him, however little it may be that he
reads, if only as a substitute for the mental prayer which is
beyond his reach.

13. Now I seem to understand that it was the good providence of
our Lord over me that found no one to teach me.  If I had, it
would have been impossible for me to persevere during the
eighteen years of my trial and of those great aridities because
of my inability to meditate.  During all this time, it was only
after Communion that I ever ventured to begin my prayer without a
book--my soul was as much afraid to pray without one, as if it
had to fight against a host.  With a book to help me--it was like
a companion, and a shield whereon to receive the blows of many
thoughts--I found comfort; for it was not usual with me to be in
aridity: but I always was so when I had no book; for my soul was
disturbed, and my thoughts wandered at once.  With one, I began
to collect my thoughts, and, using it as a decoy, kept my soul in
peace, very frequently by merely opening a book--there was no
necessity for more.  Sometimes, I read but little; at other
times, much--according as our Lord had pity on me.

14. It seemed to me, in these beginnings of which I am speaking,
that there could be no danger capable of withdrawing me from so
great a blessing, if I had but books, and could have remained
alone; and I believe that, by the grace of God, it would have
been so, if I had had a master or any one to warn me against
those occasions of sin in the beginning, and, if I fell, to bring
me quickly out of them.  If the devil had assailed me openly
then, I believe I should never have fallen into any grievous sin;
but he was so subtle, and I so weak, that all my good resolutions
were of little service--though, in those days in which I served
God, they were very profitable in enabling me, with that patience
which His Majesty gave me, to endure the alarming illnesses which
I had to bear.  I have often thought with wonder of the great
goodness of God; and my soul has rejoiced in the contemplation of
His great magnificence and mercy.  May He be blessed for
ever!--for I see clearly that He has not omitted to reward me,
even in this life, for every one of my good desires.  My good
works, however wretched and imperfect, have been made better and
perfected by Him Who is my Lord: He has rendered them
meritorious.  As to my evil deeds and my sins, He hid them at
once.  The eyes of those who saw them, He made even blind; and He
has blotted them out of their memory.  He gilds my faults, makes
virtue to shine forth, giving it to me Himself, and compelling me
to possess it, as it were, by force.

15. I must now return to that which has been enjoined me.  I say,
that if I had to describe minutely how our Lord dealt with me in
the beginning, it would be necessary for me to have another
understanding than that I have: so that I might be able to
appreciate what I owe to Him, together with my own ingratitude
and wickedness; for I have forgotten it all.

May He be blessed for ever Who has borne with me so long!  Amen.

opinion, entered the Dominican monastery of St. Thomas, Avila.
It is said that he died before he was professed.  Some said he
joined the Hieronymites; but this is not so probable (De la
Fuente).  Ribera, however, says that he did enter the novitiate
of the Hieronymites. but died before he was out of it

5. The Saint entered the Monastery of the Incarnation Nov. 2,
1533, and made her profession Nov. 3, 1534 (Bollandists and

chronicler of the Order, relying on the contract by which her
father bound himself to the monastery, says that she took the
habit Nov. 2, 1536, and that Ribera had made a mistake.

6. Her father took her from the monastery in the autumn of 1535,
according to the Bollandists, but of 1538, according to the
chronicler, who adds, that she was taken to her uncle's
house--Pedro Sanchez de Cepeda--in Hortigosa, and then to
Castellanos de la Cañada, to the house of her sister, Doña Maria,
where she remained till the spring, when she went to Bezadas for
her cure (Reforma, lib. i. ch. xi. § 2).

Chapter V.


Illness and Patience of the Saint.  The Story of a Priest Whom
She Rescued from a Life of Sin.


1. I forgot to say how, in the year of my novitiate, I suffered
much uneasiness about things in themselves of no importance; but
I was found fault with very often when I was blameless.  I bore
it painfully and with imperfection; however, I went through it
all, because of the joy I had in being a nun.  When they saw me
seeking to be alone, and even weeping over my sins at times, they
thought I was discontented, and said so.

2. All religious observances had an attraction for me, but I
could not endure any which seemed to make me contemptible.
I delighted in being thought well of by others, and was very
exact in everything I had to do.  All this I thought was a
virtue, though it will not serve as any excuse for me, because I
knew what it was to procure my own satisfaction in everything,
and so ignorance does not blot out the blame.  There may be some
excuse in the fact that the monastery was not founded in great
perfection.  I, wicked as I was, followed after that which I saw
was wrong, and neglected that which was good.

3. There was then in the house a nun labouring under a most
grievous and painful disorder, for there were open ulcers in her
body, caused by certain obstructions, through which her food was
rejected.  Of this sickness she soon died.  All the sisters, I
saw, were afraid of her malady.  I envied her patience very much;
I prayed to God that He would give me a like patience; and then,
whatever sickness it might be His pleasure to send, I do not
think I was afraid of any, for I was resolved on gaining eternal
good, and determined to gain it by any and by every means.

4. I am surprised at myself, because then I had not, as I
believe, that love of God which I think I had after I began to
pray.  Then, I had only light to see that all things that pass
away are to be lightly esteemed, and that the good things to be
gained by despising them are of great price, because they are for
ever.  His Majesty heard me also in this, for in less than two
years I was so afflicted myself that the illness which I had,
though of a different kind from that of the sister, was, I really
believe, not less painful and trying for the three years it
lasted, as I shall now relate.

5. When the time had come for which I was waiting in the place I
spoke of before [1]--I was in my sister's house, for the purpose
of undergoing the medical treatment--they took me away with the
utmost care of my comfort; that is, my father, my sister, and the
nun, my friend, who had come from the monastery with me,--for her
love for me was very great.  At that moment, Satan began to
trouble my soul; God, however, brought forth a great blessing out
of that trouble.

6. In the place to which I had gone for my cure lived a priest of
good birth and understanding, with some learning, but not much.
I went to confession to him, for I was always fond of learned
men, although confessors indifferently learned did my soul much
harm; for I did not always find confessors whose learning was as
good as I could wish it was.  I know by experience that it is
better, if the confessors are good men and of holy lives, that
they should have no learning at all, than a little; for such
confessors never trust themselves without consulting those who
are learned--nor would I trust them myself: and a really learned
confessor never deceived me. [2]  Neither did the others
willingly deceive me, only they knew no better; I thought they
were learned, and that I was not under any other obligation than
that of believing them, as their instructions to me were lax, and
left me more at liberty--for if they had been strict with me, I
am so wicked, I should have sought for others. That which was a
venial sin, they told me was no sin at all; of that which was
most grievously mortal, they said it was venial. [3]

7. This did me so much harm, that it is no wonder I should speak
of it here as a warning to others, that they may avoid an evil so
great; for I see clearly that in the eyes of God I was without
excuse, that the things I did being in themselves not good, this
should have been enough to keep me from them.  I believe that
God, by reason of my sins, allowed those confessors to deceive
themselves and to deceive me.  I myself deceived many others by
saying to them what had been said to me.

8. I continued in this blindness, I believe, more than seventeen
years, till a most learned Dominican Father [4] undeceived me in
part, and those of the Company of Jesus made me altogether so
afraid, by insisting on the erroneousness of these principles, as
I shall hereafter show. [5]

9. I began, then, by going to confession to that priest of whom I
spoke before. [6]  He took an extreme liking to me, because I had
then but little to confess in comparison with what I had
afterwards; and I had never much to say since I became a nun.
There was no harm in the liking he had for me, but it ceased to
be good, because it was in excess.  He clearly understood that I
was determined on no account whatever to do anything whereby God
might be seriously offended.  He, too, gave me a like assurance
about himself, and accordingly our conferences were many.  But at
that time, through the knowledge and fear of God which filled my
soul, what gave me most pleasure in all my conversations with
others was to speak of God; and, as I was so young, this made him
ashamed; and then, out of that great goodwill he bore me, he
began to tell me of his wretched state.  It was very sad, for he
had been nearly seven years in a most perilous condition, because
of his affection for, and conversation with, a woman of that
place; and yet he used to say Mass.  The matter was so public,
that his honour and good name were lost, and no one ventured to
speak to him about it.  I was extremely sorry for him, because I
liked him much.  I was then so imprudent and so blind as to think
it a virtue to be grateful and loyal to one who liked me.
Cursed be that loyalty which reaches so far as to go against the
law of God.  It is a madness common in the world, and it makes me
mad to see it.  We are indebted to God for all the good that men
do to us, and yet we hold it to be an act of virtue not to break
a friendship of this kind, though it lead us to go against Him.
Oh, blindness of the world!  Let me, O Lord, be most ungrateful
to the world; never at all unto Thee.  But I have been altogether
otherwise through my sins.

10. I procured further information about the matter from members
of his household; I learned more of his ruinous state, and saw
that the poor man's fault was not so grave, because the miserable
woman had had recourse to enchantments, by giving him a little
image made of copper, which she had begged him to wear for love
of her around his neck; and this no one had influence enough to
persuade him to throw away.  As to this matter of enchantments, I
do not believe it to be altogether true; but I will relate what I
saw, by way of warning to men to be on their guard against women
who will do things of this kind.  And let them be assured of
this, that women--for they are more bound to purity than men--if
once they have lost all shame before God, are in nothing whatever
to be trusted; and that in exchange for the gratification of
their will, and of that affection which the devil suggests, they
will hesitate at nothing.

11. Though I have been so wicked myself, I never fell into
anything of this kind, nor did I ever attempt to do evil; nor, if
I had the power, would I have ever constrained any one to like
me, for our Lord kept me from this.  But if He had abandoned me,
I should have done wrong in this, as I did in other things--for
there is nothing in me whereon anyone may rely.

12. When I knew this, I began to show him greater affection: my
intention was good, but the act was wrong, for I ought not to do
the least wrong for the sake of any good, how great soever it may
be.  I spoke to him most frequently of God; and this must have
done him good--though I believe that what touched him most was
his great affection for me, because, to do me a pleasure, he gave
me that little image of copper, and I had it at once thrown into
a river.  When he had given it up, like a man roused from deep
sleep, he began to consider all that he had done in those years;
and then, amazed at himself, lamenting his ruinous state, that
woman came to be hateful in his eyes.  Our Lady must have helped
him greatly, for he had a very great devotion to her Conception,
and used to keep the feast thereof with great solemnity.
In short, he broke off all relations with that woman utterly, and
was never weary of giving God thanks for the light He had given
him; and at the end of the year from the day I first saw him,
he died.

13. He had been most diligent in the service of God; and as for
that great affection he had for me, I never observed anything
wrong in it, though it might have been of greater purity.
There were also occasions wherein he might have most grievously
offended, if he had not kept himself in the near presence of God.
As I said before, [7] I would not then have done anything I knew
was a mortal sin.  And I think that observing this resolution in
me helped him to have that affection for me; for I believe that
all men must have a greater affection for those women whom they
see disposed to be good; and even for the attainment of earthly
ends, women must have more power over men because they are good,
as I shall show hereafter.  I am convinced that the priest is in
the way of salvation.  He died most piously, and completely
withdrawn from that occasion of sin.  It seems that it was the
will of our Lord he should be saved by these means.

14. I remained three months in that place, in the most grievous
sufferings; for the treatment was too severe for my constitution.
In two months--so strong were the medicines--my life was nearly
worn out; and the severity of the pain in the heart, [8] for the
cure of which I was there was much more keen: it seemed to me,
now and then, as if it had been seized by sharp teeth.  So great
was the torment, that it was feared it might end in madness.
There was a great loss of strength, for I could eat nothing
whatever, only drink.  I had a great loathing for food, and a
fever that never left me.  I was so reduced, for they had given
me purgatives daily for nearly a month, and so parched up, that
my sinews began to shrink.  The pains I had were unendurable, and
I was overwhelmed in a most deep sadness, so that I had no rest
either night or day.

15. This was the result; and thereupon my father took me back.
Then the physicians visited me again.  All gave me up; they said
I was also consumptive.  This gave me little or no concern; what
distressed me were the pains I had--for I was in pain from my
head down to my feet.  Now, nervous pains, according to the
physicians, are intolerable; and all my nerves were shrunk.
Certainly, if I had not brought this upon myself by my sins, the
torture would have been unendurable.

16. I was not more than three months in this cruel distress, for
it seemed impossible that so many ills could be borne together.
I now am astonished at myself, and the patience His Majesty gave
me--for it clearly came from Him--I look upon as a great mercy of
our Lord.  It was a great help to me to be patient, that I had
read the story of Job, in the Morals of St. Gregory (our Lord
seems to have prepared me thereby); and that I had begun the
practice of prayer, so that I might bear it all, conforming my
will to the will of God.  All my conversation was with God.
I had continually these words of Job in my thoughts and in my
mouth: "If we have received good things of the hand of our Lord,
why should we not receive evil things?" [9]  This seemed to give
me courage.

17. The feast of our Lady, in August, came round; from April
until then I had been in great pain, but more especially during
the last three months.  I made haste to go to confession, for I
had always been very fond of frequent confession.  They thought I
was driven by the fear of death; and so my father, in order to
quiet me, would not suffer me to go.  Oh, the unreasonable love
of flesh and blood!  Though it was that of a father so Catholic
and so wise--he was very much so, and this act of his could not
be the effect of any ignorance on his part--what evil it might
have done me!

18. That very night my sickness became so acute, that for about
four days I remained insensible.  They administered the Sacrament
of the last Anointing, and every hour, or rather every moment,
thought I was dying; they did nothing but repeat the Credo, as if
I could have understood anything they said.  They must have
regarded me as dead more than once, for I found afterwards drops
of wax on my eyelids.  My father, because he had not allowed me
to go to confession, was grievously distressed.  Loud cries and
many prayers were made to God: blessed be He Who heard them.

19. For a day-and-a-half the grave was open in my monastery,
waiting for my body; [10] and the Friars of our Order, in a house
at some distance from this place, performed funeral solemnities.
But it pleased our Lord I should come to myself.  I wished to go
to confession at once.  I communicated with many tears; but I do
not think those tears had their source in that pain and sorrow
only for having offended God, which might have sufficed for my
salvation--unless, indeed, the delusion which I laboured under
were some excuse for me, and into which I had been led by those
who had told me that some things were not mortal sins which
afterwards I found were so certainly.

20. Though my sufferings were unendurable, and my perceptions
dull, yet my confession, I believe, was complete as to all
matters wherein I understood myself to have offended God. This
grace, among others, did His Majesty bestow on me, that ever
since my first Communion never in confession have I failed to
confess anything I thought to be a sin, though it might be only a
venial sin.  But I think that undoubtedly my salvation was in
great peril, if I had died at that time--partly because my
confessors were so unlearned, and partly because I was so very
wicked.  It is certainly true that when I think of it, and
consider how our Lord seems to have raised me up from the dead, I
am so filled with wonder, that I almost tremble with fear. [11]

21. And now, O my soul, it were well for thee to look that danger
in the face from which our Lord delivered thee; and if thou dost
not cease to offend Him out of love thou shouldst do so out of
fear.  He might have slain thee a thousand times, and in a far
more perilous state.  I believe I exaggerate nothing if I say a
thousand times again, though he may rebuke me who has commanded
me to restrain myself in recounting my sins; and they are glossed
over enough. I pray him, for the love of God, not to suppress one
of my faults, because herein shines forth the magnificence of
God, as well as His long-suffering towards souls.  May He be
blessed for evermore, and destroy me utterly, rather than let me
cease to love Him any more!

Chapter VI.


The Great Debt She Owed to Our Lord for His Mercy to Her.
She Takes St. Joseph for Her Patron.


1. After those four days, during which I was insensible, so great
was my distress, that our Lord alone knoweth the intolerable
sufferings I endured.  My tongue was bitten to pieces; there was
a choking in my throat because I had taken nothing, and because
of my weakness, so that I could not swallow even a drop of water;
all my bones seemed to be out of joint, and the disorder of my
head was extreme.  I was bent together like a coil of ropes--for
to this was I brought by the torture of those days--unable to
move either arm, or foot, or hand, or head, any more than if I
had been dead, unless others moved me; I could move, however, I
think, one finger of my right hand.  Then, as to touching me,
that was impossible, for I was so bruised that I could not endure
it.  They used to move me in a sheet, one holding one end, and
another the other.  This lasted till Palm Sunday. [1]

2. The only comfort I had was this--if no one came near me, my
pains frequently ceased; and then, because I had a little rest, I
considered myself well, for I was afraid my patience would fail:
and thus I was exceedingly happy when I saw myself free from
those pains which were so sharp and constant, though in the cold
fits of an intermittent fever, which were most violent, they were
still unendurable.  My dislike of food was very great.

3. I was now so anxious to return to my monastery, that I had
myself conveyed thither in the state I was in.  There they
received alive one whom they had waited for as dead; but her body
was worse than dead: the sight of it could only give pain.  It is
impossible to describe my extreme weakness, for I was nothing but
bones.  I remained in this state, as I have already said, [2]
more than eight months; and was paralytic, though getting better,
for about three years.  I praised God when I began to crawl on my
hands and knees.  I bore all this with great resignation, and, if
I except the beginning of my illness, with great joy; for all
this was as nothing in comparison with the pains and tortures I
had to bear at first.  I was resigned to the will of God, even if
He left me in this state for ever.  My anxiety about the recovery
of my health seemed to be grounded on my desire to pray in
solitude, as I had been taught; for there were no means of doing
so in the infirmary.  I went to confession most frequently, spoke
much about God, and in such a way as to edify everyone; and they
all marvelled at the patience which our Lord gave me--for if it
had not come from the hand of His Majesty, it seemed impossible
to endure so great an affliction with so great a joy.

4. It was a great thing for me to have had the grace of prayer
which God had wrought in me; it made me understand what it is to
love Him.  In a little while, I saw these virtues renewed within
me; still they were not strong, for they were not sufficient to
sustain me in justice.  I never spoke ill in the slightest degree
whatever of any one, and my ordinary practice was to avoid all
detraction; for I used to keep most carefully in mind that I
ought not to assent to, nor say of another, anything I should not
like to have said of myself.  I was extremely careful to keep
this resolution on all occasions though not so perfectly, upon
some great occasions that presented themselves, as not to break
it sometimes.  But my ordinary practice was this: and thus those
who were about me, and those with whom I conversed, became so
convinced that it was right, that they adopted it as a habit.
It came to be understood that where I was, absent persons were
safe; so they were also with my friends and kindred, and with
those whom I instructed.  Still, for all this, I have a strict
account to give unto God for the bad example I gave in other
respects. May it please His Majesty to forgive me, for I have
been the cause of much evil; though not with intentions as
perverse as were the acts that followed.

5. The longing for solitude remained, and I loved to discourse
and speak of God; for if I found any one with whom I could do so,
it was a greater joy and satisfaction to me than all the
refinements--or rather to speak more correctly, the real
rudeness--of the world's conversation.  I communicated and
confessed more frequently still, and desired to do so; I was
extremely fond of reading good books; I was most deeply penitent
for having offended God; and I remember that very often I did not
dare to pray, because I was afraid of that most bitter anguish
which I felt for having offended God, dreading it as a great
chastisement.  This grew upon me afterwards to so great a degree,
that I know of no torment wherewith to compare it; and yet it was
neither more nor less because of any fear I had at any time, for
it came upon me only when I remembered the consolations of our
Lord which He gave me in prayer, the great debt I owed Him, the
evil return I made: I could not bear it.  I was also extremely
angry with myself on account of the many tears I shed for my
faults, when I saw how little I improved, seeing that neither my
good resolutions, nor the pains I took, were sufficient to keep
me from falling whenever I had the opportunity.  I looked on my
tears as a delusion; and my faults, therefore, I regarded as the
more grievous, because I saw the great goodness of our Lord to me
in the shedding of those tears, and together with them such
deep compunction.

6. I took care to go to confession as soon as I could; and, as I
think, did all that was possible on my part to return to a state
of grace.  But the whole evil lay in my not thoroughly avoiding
the occasions of sin, and in my confessors, who helped me so
little.  If they had told me that I was travelling on a dangerous
road, and that I was bound to abstain from those conversations, I
believe, without any doubt, that the matter would have been
remedied, because I could not bear to remain even for one day in
mortal sin, if I knew it.

7. All these tokens of the fear of God came to me through prayer;
and the greatest of them was this, that fear was swallowed up of
love--for I never thought of chastisement.  All the time I was so
ill, my strict watch over my conscience reached to all that is
mortal sin.

8. O my God! I wished for health, that I might serve Thee better;
that was the cause of all my ruin.  For when I saw how helpless I
was through paralysis, being still so young, and how the
physicians of this world had dealt with me, I determined to ask
those of heaven to heal me--for I wished, nevertheless, to be
well, though I bore my illness with great joy.  Sometimes, too, I
used to think that if I recovered my health, and yet were lost
for ever, I was better as I was.  But, for all that, I thought I
might serve God much better if I were well.  This is our
delusion; we do not resign ourselves absolutely to the
disposition of our Lord, Who knows best what is for our good.

9. I began by having Masses and prayers said for my
intention--prayers that were highly sanctioned; for I never liked
those other devotions which some people, especially women, make
use of with a ceremoniousness to me intolerable, but which move
them to be devout.  I have been given to understand since that
they were unseemly and superstitious; and I took for my patron
and lord the glorious St. Joseph, and recommended myself
earnestly to him.  I saw clearly that both out of this my present
trouble, and out of others of greater importance, relating to my
honour and the loss of my soul, this my father and lord delivered
me, and rendered me greater services than I knew how to ask for.
I cannot call to mind that I have ever asked him at any time for
anything which he has not granted; and I am filled with amazement
when I consider the great favours which God hath given me through
this blessed Saint; the dangers from which he hath delivered me,
both of body and of soul.  To other Saints, our Lord seems to
have given grace to succour men in some special necessity; but to
this glorious Saint, I know by experience, to help us in all: and
our Lord would have us understand that as He was Himself subject
to him upon earth--for St. Joseph having the title of father, and
being His guardian, could command Him--so now in heaven He
performs all his petitions.  I have asked others to recommend
themselves to St. Joseph, and they too know this by experience;
and there are many who are now of late devout to him, [3] having
had experience of this truth.

10. I used to keep his feast with all the solemnity I could, but
with more vanity than spirituality, seeking rather too much
splendour and effect, and yet with good intentions.  I had this
evil in me, that if our Lord gave me grace to do any good, that
good became full of imperfections and of many faults; but as for
doing wrong, the indulgence of curiosity and vanity, I was very
skilful and active therein.  Our Lord forgive me!

11. Would that I could persuade all men to be devout to this
glorious Saint; for I know by long experience what blessings he
can obtain for us from God.  I have never known any one who was
really devout to him, and who honoured him by particular
services, who did not visibly grow more and more in virtue; for
he helps in a special way those souls who commend themselves to
him.  It is now some years since I have always on his feast asked
him for something, and I always have it.  If the petition be in
any way amiss, he directs it aright for my greater good.

12. If I were a person who had authority to write, it would be a
pleasure to me to be diffusive in speaking most minutely of the
graces which this glorious Saint has obtained for me and for
others.  But that I may not go beyond the commandment that is
laid upon me, I must in many things be more brief than I could
wish, and more diffusive than is necessary in others; for, in
short, I am a person who, in all that is good, has but little
discretion.  But I ask, for the love of God, that he who does not
believe me will make the trial for himself--when he will see by
experience the great good that results from commending oneself to
this glorious patriarch, and being devout to him.  Those who give
themselves to prayer should in a special manner have always a
devotion to St. Joseph; for I know not how any man can think of
the Queen of the angels, during the time that she suffered so
much with the Infant Jesus, without giving thanks to St. Joseph
for the services he rendered them then.  He who cannot find any
one to teach him how to pray, let him take this glorious Saint
for his master, and he will not wander out of the way.

13. May it please our Lord that I have not done amiss in
venturing to speak about St. Joseph; for, though I publicly
profess my devotion to him, I have always failed in my service to
him and imitation of him.  He was like himself when he made me
able to rise and walk, no longer a paralytic; and I, too, am like
myself when I make so bad a use of this grace.

14. Who could have said that I was so soon to fall, after such
great consolations from God--after His Majesty had implanted
virtues in me which of themselves made me serve Him--after I had
been, as it were, dead, and in such extreme peril of eternal
damnation--after He had raised me up, soul and body, so that all
who saw me marvelled to see me alive?  What can it mean, O my
Lord?  The life we live is so full of danger!  While I am writing
this--and it seems to me, too, by Thy grace and mercy--I may say
with St. Paul, though not so truly as he did: "It is not I who
live now, but Thou, my Creator, livest in me." [4]  For some
years past, so it seems to me, Thou hast held me by the hand; and
I see in myself desires and resolutions--in some measure tested
by experience, in many ways, during that time--never to do
anything, however slight it may be, contrary to Thy will, though
I must have frequently offended Thy Divine Majesty without being
aware of it; and I also think that nothing can be proposed to me
that I should not with great resolution undertake for Thy love.
In some things Thou hast Thyself helped me to succeed therein.
I love neither the world, nor the things of the world; nor do I
believe that anything that does not come from Thee can give me
pleasure; everything else seems to me a heavy cross.

15. Still, I may easily deceive myself, and it may be that I am
not what I say I am; but Thou knowest, O my Lord, that, to the
best of my knowledge, I lie not.  I am afraid, and with good
reason, lest Thou shouldst abandon me; for I know now how far my
strength and little virtue can reach, if Thou be not ever at hand
to supply them, and to help me never to forsake Thee.  May His
Majesty grant that I be not forsaken of Thee even now, when I am
thinking all this of myself!

16. I know not how we can wish to live, seeing that everything is
so uncertain.  Once, O Lord, I thought it impossible to forsake
Thee so utterly; and now that I have forsaken Thee so often, I
cannot help being afraid; for when Thou didst withdraw but a
little from me, I fell down to the ground at once.  Blessed for
ever be Thou!  Though I have forsaken Thee, Thou hast not
forsaken me so utterly but that Thou hast come again and raised
me up, giving me Thy hand always.  Very often, O Lord, I would
not take it: very often I would not listen when Thou wert calling
me again, as I am going to show.


1. March 25, 1537.

2. Ch. v. § 17.  The Saint left her monastery in 1535; and in the
spring of 1536 went from her sister's house to Bezadas; and in
July of that year was brought back to her father's house in
Avila, wherein she remained till Palm Sunday, 1537, when she
returned to the Monastery of the Incarnation.  She had been
seized with paralysis there, and laboured under it nearly three
years, from 1536 to 1539, when she was miraculously healed
through the intercession of St. Joseph (Bolland, n. 100, 101).
The dates of the Chronicler are different from these.

3. Of the devotion to St. Joseph, F. Faber (The Blessed
Sacrament, bk. ii. p. 199, 3rd ed.) says that it took its rise in
the West, in a confraternity in Avignon.  "Then it spread over
the church. Gerson was raised up to be its doctor and theologian,
and St. Teresa to be its Saint, and St. Francis of Sales to be
its popular teacher and missionary.  The houses of Carmel were
like the holy house of Nazareth to it; and the colleges of the
Jesuits, its peaceful sojourns in dark Egypt."

me Christus."



Chapter VII.


Lukewarmness.  The Loss of Grace.  Inconvenience of Laxity in
Religious Houses.


1. So, then, going on from pastime to pastime, from vanity to
vanity, from one occasion of sin to another, I began to expose
myself exceedingly to the very greatest dangers: my soul was so
distracted by many vanities, that I was ashamed to draw near unto
God in an act of such special friendship as that of prayer. [1]
As my sins multiplied, I began to lose the pleasure and comfort I
had in virtuous things: and that loss contributed to the
abandonment of prayer.  I see now most clearly, O my Lord, that
this comfort departed from me because I had departed from Thee.

2. It was the most fearful delusion into which Satan could plunge
me--to give up prayer under the pretence of humility.  I began to
be afraid of giving myself to prayer, because I saw myself so
lost.  I thought it would be better for me, seeing that in my
wickedness I was one of the most wicked, to live like the
multitude--to say the prayers which I was bound to say, and that
vocally: not to practise mental prayer nor commune with God so
much; for I deserved to be with the devils, and was deceiving
those who were about me, because I made an outward show of
goodness; and therefore the community in which I dwelt is not to
be blamed; for with my cunning I so managed matters, that all had
a good opinion of me; and yet I did not seek this deliberately by
simulating devotion; for in all that relates to hypocrisy and
ostentation--glory be to God!--I do not remember that I ever
offended Him, [2] so far as I know.  The very first movements
herein gave me such pain, that the devil would depart from me
with loss, and the gain remained with me; and thus, accordingly,
he never tempted me much in this way.  Perhaps, however, if God
had permitted Satan to tempt me as sharply herein as he tempted
me in other things, I should have fallen also into this; but His
Majesty has preserved me until now.  May He be blessed for
evermore!  It was rather a heavy affliction to me that I should
be thought so well of; for I knew my own secret.

3. The reason why they thought I was not so wicked was this: they
saw that I, who was so young, and exposed to so many occasions of
sin, withdrew myself so often into solitude for prayer, read
much, spoke of God, that I liked to have His image painted in
many places, to have an oratory of my own, and furnish it with
objects of devotion, that I spoke ill of no one, and other things
of the same kind in me which have the appearance of virtue.  Yet
all the while--I was so vain--I knew how to procure respect for
myself by doing those things which in the world are usually
regarded with respect.

4. In consequence of this, they gave me as much liberty as they
did to the oldest nuns, and even more, and had great confidence
in me; for as to taking any liberty for myself, or doing anything
without leave--such as conversing through the door, or in secret,
or by night--I do not think I could have brought myself to speak
with anybody in the monastery in that way, and I never did it;
for our Lord held me back.  It seemed to me--for I considered
many things carefully and of set purpose--that it would be a very
evil deed on my part, wicked as I was, to risk the credit of so
many nuns, who were all good--as if everything else I did was
well done!  In truth, the evil I did was not the result of
deliberation, as this would have been, if I had done it, although
it was too much so.

5. Therefore, I think that it did me much harm to be in a
monastery not enclosed.  The liberty which those who were good
might have with advantage--they not being obliged to do more than
they do, because they had not bound themselves to
enclosure--would certainly have led me, who am wicked, straight
to hell, if our Lord, by so many remedies and means of His most
singular mercy, had not delivered me out of that danger--and it
is, I believe, the very greatest danger--namely, a monastery of
women unenclosed--yea, more, I think it is, for those who will be
wicked, a road to hell, rather than a help to their weakness.
This is not to be understood of my monastery; for there are so
many there who in the utmost sincerity, and in great perfection,
serve our Lord, so that His Majesty, according to His goodness,
cannot but be gracious unto them; neither is it one of those
which are most open for all religious observances are kept in it;
and I am speaking only of others which I have seen and known.

6. I am exceedingly sorry for these houses, because our Lord must
of necessity send His special inspirations not merely once, but
many times, if the nuns therein are to be saved, seeing that the
honours and amusements of the world are allowed among them, and
the obligations of their state are so ill-understood.  God grant
they may not count that to be virtue which is sin, as I did so
often!  It is very difficult to make people understand this; it
is necessary our Lord Himself should take the matter seriously
into His own hands.

7. If parents would take my advice, now that they are at no pains
to place their daughters where they may walk in the way of
salvation without incurring a greater risk than they would do if
they were left in the world, let them look at least at that which
concerns their good name.  Let them marry them to persons of a
much lower degree, rather than place them in monasteries of this
kind, unless they be of extremely good inclinations, and God
grant that these inclinations may come to good! or let them keep
them at home.  If they will be wicked at home, their evil life
can be hidden only for a short time; but in monasteries it can be
hidden long, and, in the end, it is our Lord that discovers it.
They injure not only themselves, but all the nuns also.  And all
the while the poor things are not in fault; for they walk in the
way that is shown them.  Many of them are to be pitied; for they
wished to withdraw from the world, and, thinking to escape from
the dangers of it, and that they were going to serve our Lord,
have found themselves in ten worlds at once, without knowing what
to do, or how to help themselves.  Youth and sensuality and the
devil invite them and incline them to follow certain ways which
are of the essence of worldliness.  They see these ways, so to
speak, considered as safe there.

8. Now, these seem to me to be in some degree like those wretched
heretics who will make themselves blind, and who will consider
that which they do to be good, and so believe, but without really
believing; for they have within themselves something that tells
them it is wrong.

9. Oh, what utter ruin! utter ruin of religious persons--I am not
speaking now more of women than of men--where the rules of the
Order are not kept; where the same monastery offers two roads:
one of virtue and observance, the other of inobservance, and both
equally frequented!  I have spoken incorrectly: they are not
equally frequented; for, on account of our sins, the way of the
greatest imperfection is the most frequented; and because it is
the broadest, it is also the most in favour.  The way of
religious observance is so little used, that the friar and the
nun who would really begin to follow their vocation thoroughly
have reason to fear the members of their communities more than
all the devils together.  They must be more cautious, and
dissemble more, when they would speak of that friendship with God
which they desire to have, than when they would speak of those
friendships and affections which the devil arranges in
monasteries.  I know not why we are astonished that the Church is
in so much trouble, when we see those, who ought to be an example
of every virtue to others, so disfigure the work which the spirit
of the Saints departed wrought in their Orders.  May it please
His Divine Majesty to apply a remedy to this, as He sees it to be
needful!  Amen.

10. So, then, when I began to indulge in these conversations, I
did not think, seeing they were customary, that my soul must be
injured and dissipated, as I afterwards found it must be, by such
conversations.  I thought that, as receiving visits was so common
in many monasteries, no more harm would befall me thereby than
befell others, whom I knew to be good.  I did not observe that
they were much better than I was, and that an act which was
perilous for me was not so perilous for them; and yet I have no
doubt there was some danger in it, were it nothing else but a
waste of time.

11. I was once with a person--it was at the very beginning of my
acquaintance with her when our Lord was pleased to show me that
these friendships were not good for me: to warn me also, and in
my blindness, which was so great, to give me light.  Christ stood
before me, stern and grave, giving me to understand what in my
conduct was offensive to Him.  I saw Him with the eyes of the
soul more distinctly than I could have seen Him with the eyes of
the body.  The vision made so deep an impression upon me, that,
though it is more than twenty-six years ago, [3] I seem to see
Him present even now.  I was greatly astonished and disturbed,
and I resolved not to see that person again.

12. It did me much harm that I did not then know it was possible
to see anything otherwise than with the eyes of the body; [4] so
did Satan too, in that he helped me to think so: he made me
understand it to be impossible, and suggested that I had imagined
the vision--that it might be Satan himself--and other
suppositions of that kind.  For all this, the impression remained
with me that the vision was from God, and not an imagination;
but, as it was not to my liking, I forced myself to lie to
myself; and as I did not dare to discuss the matter with any one,
and as great importunity was used, I went back to my former
conversation with the same person, and with others also, at
different times; for I was assured that there was no harm in
seeing such a person, and that I gained, instead of losing,
reputation by doing so.  I spent many years in this pestilent
amusement; for it never appeared to me, when I was engaged in it,
to be so bad as it really was, though at times I saw clearly it
was not good.  But no one caused me the same distraction which
that person did of whom I am speaking; and that was because I had
a great affection for her.

13. At another time, when I was with that person, we saw, both of
us, and others who were present also saw, something like a great
toad crawling towards us, more rapidly than such a creature is in
the habit of crawling.  I cannot understand how a reptile of that
kind could, in the middle of the day, have come forth from that
place; it never had done so before, [5] but the impression it
made on me was such, that I think it must have had a meaning;
neither have I ever forgotten it.  Oh, the greatness of God! with
what care and tenderness didst Thou warn me in every way! and how
little I profited by those warnings!

14. There was in that house a nun, who was related to me, now
grown old, a great servant of God, and a strict observer of the
rule.  She too warned me from time to time; but I not only did
not listen to her, but was even offended, thinking she was
scandalized without cause.  I have mentioned this in order that
my wickedness and the great goodness of God might be understood,
and to show how much I deserved hell for ingratitude so great,
and, moreover, if it should be our Lord's will and pleasure that
any nun at any time should read this, that she might take warning
by me.  I beseech them all, for the love of our Lord, to flee
from such recreations as these.

15. May His Majesty grant I may undeceive some one of the many I
led astray when I told them there was no harm in these things,
and assured them there was no such great danger therein. I did so
because I was blind myself; for I would not deliberately lead
them astray.  By the bad example I set before them--I spoke of
this before [6]--I was the occasion of much evil, not thinking I
was doing so much harm.

16. In those early days, when I was ill, and before I knew how to
be of use to myself, I had a very strong desire to further the
progress of others: [7] a most common temptation of beginners.
With me, however, it had good results.  Loving my father so much,
I longed to see him in the possession of that good which I seemed
to derive myself from prayer.  I thought that in this life there
could not be a greater good than prayer; and by roundabout ways,
as well as I could, I contrived make him enter upon it; I gave
him books for that end.  As he was so good--I said so
before [8]--this exercise took such a hold upon him, that in five
or six years, I think it was, he made so great a progress that I
used to praise our Lord for it.  It was a very great consolation
to me. He had most grievous trials of diverse kinds; and he bore
them all with the greatest resignation.  He came often to see me;
for it was a comfort to him to speak of the things of God.

17. And now that I had become so dissipated, and had ceased to
pray, and yet saw that he still thought I was what I used to be,
I could not endure it, and so undeceived him.  I had been a year
and more without praying, thinking it an act of greater humility
to abstain.  This--I shall speak of it again [9]--was the
greatest temptation I ever had, because it very nearly wrought my
utter ruin; [10] for, when I used to pray, if I offended God one
day, on the following days I would recollect myself, and withdraw
farther from the occasions of sin.

18. When that blessed man, having that good opinion of me, came
to visit me, it pained me to see him so deceived as to think that
I used to pray to God as before.  So I told him that I did not
pray; but I did not tell him why.  I put my infirmities forward
as an excuse; for though I had recovered from that which was so
troublesome, I have always been weak, even very much so; and
though my infirmities are somewhat less troublesome now than they
were, they still afflict me in many ways; specially, I have been
suffering for twenty years from sickness every morning, [11] so
that I could not take any food till past mid-day, and even
occasionally not till later; and now, since my Communions have
become more frequent, it is at night, before I lie down to rest,
that the sickness occurs, and with greater pain; for I have to
bring it on with a feather, or other means.  If I do not bring it
on, I suffer more; and thus I am never, I believe, free from
great pain, which is sometimes very acute, especially about the
heart; though the fainting-fits are now but of rare occurrence.
I am also, these eight years past, free from the paralysis, and
from other infirmities of fever, which I had so often.  These
afflictions I now regard so lightly, that I am even glad of them,
believing that our Lord in some degree takes His pleasure
in them.

19. My father believed me when I gave him that for a reason, as
he never told a lie himself; neither should I have done so,
considering the relation we were in.  I told him, in order to be
the more easily believed, that it was much for me to be able to
attend in choir, though I saw clearly that this was no excuse
whatever; neither, however, was it a sufficient reason for giving
up a practice which does not require, of necessity, bodily
strength, but only love and a habit thereof; yet our Lord always
furnishes an opportunity for it, if we but seek it.  I say
always; for though there may be times, as in illness, and from
other causes, when we cannot be much alone, yet it never can be
but there must be opportunities when our strength is sufficient
for the purpose; and in sickness itself, and amidst other
hindrances, true prayer consists, when the soul loves, in
offering up its burden, and in thinking of Him for Whom it
suffers, and in the resignation of the will, and in a thousand
ways which then present themselves.  It is under these
circumstances that love exerts itself for it is not necessarily
prayer when we are alone; and neither is it not prayer when we
are not.

20. With a little care, we may find great blessings on those
occasions when our Lord, by means of afflictions, deprives us of
time for prayer; and so I found it when I had a good conscience.
But my father, having that opinion of me which he had, and
because of the love he bore me, believed all I told him;
moreover, he was sorry for me; and as he had now risen to great
heights of prayer himself, he never remained with me long; for
when he had seen me, he went his way, saying that he was wasting
his time.  As I was wasting it in other vanities, I cared little
about this.

21. My father was not the only person whom I prevailed upon to
practise prayer, though I was walking in vanity myself.  When I
saw persons fond of reciting their prayers, I showed them how to
make a meditation, and helped them and gave them books; for from
the time I began myself to pray, as I said before, [12] I always
had a desire that others should serve God.  I thought, now that I
did not myself serve our Lord according to the light I had, that
the knowledge His Majesty had given me ought not to be lost, and
that others should serve Him for me. [13]  I say this in order to
explain the great blindness I was in: going to ruin myself, and
labouring to save others.

22. At this time, that illness befell my father of which he
died; [14] it lasted some days.  I went to nurse him, being more
sick in spirit than he was in body, owing to my many
vanities--though not, so far as I know, to the extent of being in
mortal sin--through the whole of that wretched time of which I am
speaking; for, if I knew myself to be in mortal sin, I would not
have continued in it on any account.  I suffered much myself
during his illness.  I believe I rendered him some service in
return for what he had suffered in mine.  Though I was very ill,
I did violence to myself; and though in losing him I was to lose
all the comfort and good of my life--he was all this to me--I was
so courageous, that I never betrayed my sorrows, concealing them
till he was dead, as if I felt none at all.  It seemed as if my
very soul were wrenched when I saw him at the point of death--my
love for him was so deep.

23. It was a matter for which we ought to praise our Lord--the
death that he died, and the desire he had to die; so also was the
advice he gave us after the last anointing, how he charged us to
recommend him to God, and to pray for mercy for him, how he bade
us serve God always, and consider how all things come to an end.
He told us with tears how sorry he was that he had not served Him
himself; for he wished he was a friar--I mean, that he had been
one in the Strictest Order that is.  I have a most assured
conviction that our Lord, some fifteen days before, had revealed
to him he was not to live; for up to that time, though very ill,
he did not think so; but now, though he was somewhat better, and
the physicians said so, he gave no heed to them, but employed
himself in the ordering of his soul.

24. His chief suffering consisted in a most acute pain of the
shoulders, which never left him: it was so sharp at times, that
it put him into great torture.  I said to him, that as he had so
great a devotion to our Lord carrying His cross on His shoulders,
he should now think that His Majesty wished him to feel somewhat
of that pain which He then suffered Himself. This so comforted
him, that I do not think I heard him complain afterwards.

25. He remained three days without consciousness; but on the day
he died, our Lord restored him so completely, that we were
astonished: he preserved his understanding to the last; for in
the middle of the creed, which he repeated himself, he died.
He lay there like an angel--such he seemed to me, if I may say
so, both in soul and disposition: he was very good.

26. I know not why I have said this, unless it be for the purpose
of showing how much the more I am to be blamed for my wickedness;
for after seeing such a death, and knowing what his life had
been, I, in order to be in any wise like unto such a father,
ought to have grown better.  His confessor, a most learned
Dominican, [15] used to say that he had no doubt he went straight
to heaven. [16]  He had heard his confession for some years, and
spoke with praise of the purity of his conscience.

27. This Dominican father, who was a very good man, fearing God,
did me a very great service; for I confessed to him.  He took
upon himself the task of helping my soul in earnest, and of
making me see the perilous state I was in. [17]  He sent me to
Communion once a fortnight; [18] and I, by degrees beginning to
speak to him, told him about my prayer.  He charged me never to
omit it: that, anyhow, it could not do me anything but good.
I began to return to it--though I did not cut off the occasions
of sin--and never afterwards gave it up.  My life became most
wretched, because I learned in prayer more and more of my faults.
On one side, God was calling me; on the other, I was following
the world.  All the things of God gave me great pleasure; and I
was a prisoner to the things of the world.  It seemed as if I
wished to reconcile two contradictions, so much at variance one
with another as are the life of the spirit and the joys and
pleasures and amusements of sense. [19]

28. I suffered much in prayer; for the spirit was slave, and not
master; and so I was not able to shut myself up within
myself--that was my whole method of prayer--without shutting up
with me a thousand vanities at the same time.  I spent many years
in this way; and I am now astonished that any one could have
borne it without abandoning either the one or the other.  I know
well that it was not in my power then to give up prayer, because
He held me in His hand Who sought me that He might show me
greater mercies.

29. O my God! if I might, I would speak of the occasions from
which God delivered me, and how I threw myself into them again;
and of the risks I ran of losing utterly my good name, from which
He delivered me.  I did things to show what I was; and our Lord
hid the evil, and revealed some little virtue--if so be I had
any--and made it great in the eyes of all, so that they always
held me in much honour.  For although my follies came
occasionally into light, people would not believe it when they
saw other things, which they thought good.  The reason is, that
He Who knoweth all things saw it was necessary it should be so,
in order that I might have some credit given me by those to whom
in after years I was to speak of His service.  His supreme
munificence regarded not my great sins, but rather the desires I
frequently had to please Him, and the pain I felt because I had
not the strength to bring those desires to good effect.

30. O Lord of my soul! how shall I be able to magnify the graces
which Thou, in those years, didst bestow upon me?  Oh, how, at
the very time that I offended Thee most, Thou didst prepare me in
a moment, by a most profound compunction, to taste of the
sweetness of Thy consolations and mercies!  In truth, O my King,
Thou didst administer to me the most delicate and painful
chastisement it was possible for me to bear; for Thou knewest
well what would have given me the most pain.  Thou didst chastise
my sins with great consolations.  I do not believe I am saying
foolish things, though it may well be that I am beside myself
whenever I call to mind my ingratitude and my wickedness.

31. It was more painful for me, in the state I was in, to receive
graces, when I had fallen into grievous faults, than it would
have been to receive chastisement; for one of those faults, I am
sure, used to bring me low, shame and distress me, more than many
diseases, together with many heavy trials, could have done.
For, as to the latter, I saw that I deserved them; and it seemed
to me that by them I was making some reparation for my sins,
though it was but slight, for my sins are so many.  But when I
see myself receive graces anew, after being so ungrateful for
those already received, that is to me--and, I believe, to all who
have any knowledge or love of God--a fearful kind of torment.  We
may see how true this is by considering what a virtuous mind must
be. Hence my tears and vexation when I reflected on what I felt,
seeing myself in a condition to fall at every moment, though my
resolutions and desires then--I am speaking of that
time--were strong.

32. It is a great evil for a soul to be alone in the midst of
such great dangers; it seems to me that if I had had any one with
whom I could have spoken of all this, it might have helped me not
to fall.  I might, at least, have been ashamed before him--and
yet I was not ashamed before God.

33. For this reason, I would advise those who give themselves to
prayer, particularly at first, to form friendships; and converse
familiarly, with others who are doing the same thing.  It is a
matter of the last importance, even if it lead only to helping
one another by prayer: how much more, seeing that it has led to
much greater gain!  Now, if in their intercourse one with
another, and in the indulgence of human affections even not of
the best kind, men seek friends with whom they may refresh
themselves, and for the purpose of having greater satisfaction in
speaking of their empty joys, I know no reason why it should not
be lawful for him who is beginning to love and serve God in
earnest to confide to another his joys and sorrows; for they who
are given to prayer are thoroughly accustomed to both.

34. For if that friendship with God which he desires be real, let
him not be afraid of vain-glory; and if the first movements
thereof assail him, he will escape from it with merit; and I
believe that he who will discuss the matter with this intention
will profit both himself and those who hear him, and thus will
derive more light for his own understanding, as well as for the
instruction of his friends.  He who in discussing his method of
prayer falls into vain-glory will do so also when he hears Mass
devoutly, if he is seen of men, and in doing other good works,
which must be done under pain of being no Christian; and yet
these things must not be omitted through fear of vain-glory.

35. Moreover, it is a most important matter for those souls who
are not strong in virtue; for they have so many people, enemies
as well as friends, to urge them the wrong way, that I do not see
how this point is capable of exaggeration.  It seems to me that
Satan has employed this artifice--and it is of the greatest
service to him--namely, that men who really wish to love and
please God should hide the fact, while others, at his suggestion,
make open show of their malicious dispositions; and this is so
common, that it seems a matter of boasting now, and the offences
committed against God are thus published abroad.

36. I do not know whether the things I am saying are foolish or
not.  If they be so, your reverence will strike them out.
I entreat you to help my simplicity by adding a good deal to
this, because the things that relate to the service of God are so
feebly managed, that it is necessary for those who would serve
Him to join shoulder to shoulder, if they are to advance at all;
for it is considered safe to live amidst the vanities and
pleasures of the world, and few there be who regard them with
unfavourable eyes.  But if any one begins to give himself up to
the service of God, there are so many to find fault with him,
that it becomes necessary for him to seek companions, in order
that he may find protection among them till he grows strong
enough not to feel what he may be made to suffer.  If he does
not, he will find himself in great straits.

37. This, I believe, must have been the reason why some of the
Saints withdrew into the desert.  And it is a kind of humility in
man not to trust to himself, but to believe that God will help
him in his relations with those with whom he converses; and
charity grows by being diffused; and there are a thousand
blessings herein which I would not dare to speak of, if I had not
known by experience the great importance of it.  It is very true
that I am the most wicked and the basest of all who are born of
women; but I believe that he who, humbling himself, though
strong, yet trusteth not in himself, and believeth another who in
this matter has had experience, will lose nothing.  Of myself I
may say that, if our Lord had not revealed to me this truth, and
given me the opportunity of speaking very frequently to persons
given to prayer, I should have gone on falling and rising till I
tumbled into hell.  I had many friends to help me to fall; but as
to rising again, I was so much left to myself, that I wonder now
I was not always on the ground.  I praise God for His mercy; for
it was He only Who stretched out His hand to me.  May He be
blessed for ever!  Amen.

Chapter VIII.


The Saint Ceases Not to Pray.  Prayer the Way to Recover What
Is Lost.  All Exhorted to Pray.  The Great Advantage of Prayer,
Even to Those Who May Have Ceased from It.


1. It is not without reason that I have dwelt so long on this
portion of my life.  I see clearly that it will give no one
pleasure to see anything so base; and certainly I wish those who
may read this to have me in abhorrence, as a soul so obstinate
and so ungrateful to Him Who did so much for me.  I could wish,
too, I had permission to say how often at this time I failed in
my duty to God, because I was not leaning on the strong pillar of
prayer.  I passed nearly twenty years on this stormy sea, falling
and rising, but rising to no good purpose, seeing that I went and
fell again.  My life was one of perfection; but it was so mean,
that I scarcely made any account whatever of venial sins; and
though of mortal sins I was afraid, I was not so afraid of them
as I ought to have been, because I did not avoid the perilous
occasions of them.  I may say that it was the most painful life
that can be imagined, because I had no sweetness in God, and no
pleasure in the world.

2. When I was in the midst of the pleasures of the world, the
remembrance of what I owed to God made me sad; and when I was
praying to God, my worldly affections disturbed me.  This is so
painful a struggle, that I know not how I could have borne it for
a month, let alone for so many years.  Nevertheless, I can trace
distinctly the great mercy of our Lord to me, while thus immersed
in the world, in that I had still the courage to pray.  I say
courage, because I know of nothing in the whole world which
requires greater courage than plotting treason against the King,
knowing that He knows it, and yet never withdrawing from His
presence; for, granting that we are always in the presence of
God, yet it seems to me that those who pray arc in His presence
in a very different sense; for they, as it were, see that He is
looking upon them; while others may be for days together without
even once recollecting that God sees them.

3. It is true, indeed, that during these years there were many
months, and, I believe, occasionally a whole year, in which I so
kept guard over myself that I did not offend our Lord, gave
myself much to prayer, and took some pains, and that
successfully, not to offend Him.  I speak of this now, because
all I am saying is strictly true; but I remember very little of
those good days, and so they must have been few, while my evil
days were many.  Still, the days that passed over without my
spending a great part of them in prayer were few, unless I was
very ill, or very much occupied.

4. When I was ill, I was well with God.  I contrived that those
about me should be so, too, and I made supplications to our Lord
for this grace, and spoke frequently of Him.  Thus, with the
exception of that year of which I have been speaking, during
eight-and-twenty years of prayer, I spent more than eighteen in
that strife and contention which arose out of my attempts to
reconcile God and the world.  As to the other years, of which I
have now to speak, in them the grounds of the warfare, though it
was not slight, were changed; but inasmuch as I was--at least, I
think so--serving God, and aware of the vanity of the world, all
has been pleasant, as I shall show hereafter. [1]

5. The reason, then, of my telling this at so great a length is
that, as I have just said, [2] the mercy of God and my
ingratitude, on the one hand, may become known; and, on the
other, that men may understand how great is the good which God
works in a soul when He gives it a disposition to pray in
earnest, though it may not be so well prepared as it ought to be.
If that soul perseveres in spite of sins, temptations, and
relapses, brought about in a thousand ways by Satan, our Lord
will bring it at last--I am certain of it--to the harbour of
salvation, as He has brought me myself; for so it seems to me
now.  May His Majesty grant I may never go back and be lost!
He who gives himself to prayer is in possession of a great
blessing, of which many saintly and good men have written--I am
speaking of mental prayer--glory be to God for it; and, if they
had not done so, I am not proud enough, though I have but little
humility, to presume to discuss it.

6. I may speak of that which I know by experience; and so I say,
let him never cease from prayer who has once begun it, be his
life ever so wicked; for prayer is the way to amend it, and
without prayer such amendment will be much more difficult.
Let him not be tempted by Satan, as I was, to give it up, on the
pretence of humility; [3] let him rather believe that His words
are true Who says that, if we truly repent, and resolve never to
offend Him, He will take us into His favour again, [4] give us
the graces He gave us before, and occasionally even greater, if
our repentance deserve it.  And as to him who has not begun to
pray, I implore him by the love of our Lord not to deprive
himself of so great a good.

7. Herein there is nothing to be afraid of, but everything to
hope for.  Granting that such a one does not advance, nor make an
effort to become perfect, so as to merit the joys and
consolations which the perfect receive from God, yet he will by
little and little attain to a knowledge of the road which leads
to heaven.  And if he perseveres, I hope in the mercy of God for
him, seeing that no one ever took Him for his friend that was not
amply rewarded; for mental prayer is nothing else, in my opinion,
but being on terms of friendship with God, frequently conversing
in secret with Him Who, we know, loves us.  Now, true love and
lasting friendship require certain dispositions: those of our
Lord, we know, are absolutely perfect; ours, vicious, sensual,
and thankless; and you cannot therefore, bring yourselves to love
Him as He loves you, because you have not the disposition to do
so; and if you do not love Him, yet, seeing how much it concerns
you to have His friendship, and how great is His love for you,
rise above that pain you feel at being much with Him Who is so
different from you.

8. O infinite goodness of my God!  I seem to see Thee and myself
in this relation to one another.  O Joy of the angels! when I
consider it, I wish I could wholly die of love!  How true it is
that Thou endurest those who will not endure Thee!  Oh, how good
a friend art Thou, O my Lord! how Thou comfortest and endurest,
and also waitest for them to make themselves like unto Thee, and
yet, in the meanwhile, art Thyself so patient of the state they
are in!  Thou takest into account the occasions during which they
seek Thee, and for a moment of penitence forgettest their
offences against Thyself.

9. I have seen this distinctly in my own case, and I cannot tell
why the whole world does not labour to draw near to Thee in this
particular friendship.  The wicked, who do not resemble Thee,
ought to do so, in order that Thou mayest make them good, and for
that purpose should permit Thee to remain with them at least for
two hours daily, even though they may not remain with Thee but,
as I used to do, with a thousand distractions, and with worldly
thoughts.  In return for this violence which they offer to
themselves for the purpose of remaining in a company so good as
Thine--for at first they can do no more, and even afterwards at
times--Thou, O Lord, defendest them against the assaults of evil
spirits, whose power Thou restrainest, and even lessenest daily,
giving to them the victory over these their enemies.  So it is, O
Life of all lives, Thou slayest none that put their trust in
Thee, and seek Thy friendship; yea, rather, Thou sustainest their
bodily life in greater vigour, and makest their soul to live.

10. I do not understand what there can be to make them afraid who
are afraid to begin mental prayer, nor do I know what it is they
dread.  The devil does well to bring this fear upon us, that he
may really hurt us by putting me in fear, he can make me cease
from thinking of my offences against God, of the great debt I owe
Him, of the existence of heaven and hell, and of the great
sorrows and trials He underwent for me.  That was all my prayer,
and had been, when I was in this dangerous state, and it was on
those subjects I dwelt whenever I could; and very often, for some
years, I was more occupied with the wish to see the end of the
time I had appointed for myself to spend in prayer, and in
watching the hour-glass, than with other thoughts that were good.
If a sharp penance had been laid upon me, I know of none that I
would not very often have willingly undertaken, rather than
prepare myself for prayer by self-recollection.  And certainly
the violence with which Satan assailed me was so irresistible, or
my evil habits were so strong, that I did not betake myself to
prayer; and the sadness I felt on entering the oratory was so
great, that it required all the courage I had to force myself in.
They say of me that my courage is not slight, and it is known
that God has given me a courage beyond that of a woman; but I
have made a bad use of it.  In the end, our Lord came to my help;
and then, when I had done this violence to myself, I found
greater peace and joy than I sometimes had when I had a desire
to pray.

11. If, then, our Lord bore so long with me, who was so
wicked--and it is plain that it was by prayer all my evil was
corrected--why should any one, how wicked soever he may be, have
any fear? Let him be ever so wicked, he will not remain in his
wickedness so many years as I did, after receiving so many graces
from our Lord.  Is there any one who can despair, when He bore so
long with me, only because I desired and contrived to find some
place and some opportunities for Him to be alone with me--and
that very often against my will? for I did violence to myself, or
rather our Lord Himself did violence to me.

12. If, then, to those who do not serve God, but rather offend
Him, prayer be all this, and so necessary, and if no one can
really find out any harm it can do him, and if the omission of it
be not a still greater harm, why, then, should they abstain from
it who serve and desire to serve God?  Certainly I cannot
comprehend it, unless it be that men have a mind to go through
the troubles of this life in greater misery, and to shut the door
in the face of God, so that He shall give them no comfort in it.
I am most truly sorry for them, because they serve God at their
own cost; for of those who pray, God Himself defrays the charges,
seeing that for a little trouble He gives sweetness, in order
that, by the help it supplies, they may bear their trials.

13. But because I have much to say hereafter of this sweetness,
which our Lord gives to those who persevere in prayer, [5] I do
not speak of it here; only this will I say: prayer is the door to
those great graces which our Lord bestowed upon me.  If this door
be shut, I do not see how He can bestow them; for even if He
entered into a soul to take His delight therein, and to make that
soul also delight in Him, there is no way by which He can do so;
for His will is, that such a soul should be lonely and pure, with
a great desire to receive His graces.  If we put many hindrances
in the way, and take no pains whatever to remove them, how can He
come to us, and how can we have any desire that He should show us
His great mercies?

14. I will speak now--for it is very important to understand
it--of the assaults which Satan directs against a soul for the
purpose of taking it, and of the contrivances and compassion
wherewith our Lord labours to convert it to Himself, in order
that men may behold His mercy, and the great good it was for me
that I did not give up prayer and spiritual reading, and that
they may be on their guard against the dangers against which I
was not on my guard myself.  And, above all, I implore them for
the love of our Lord, and for the great love with which He goeth
about seeking our conversion to Himself, to beware of the
occasions of sin; for once placed therein, we have no ground to
rest on--so many enemies then assail us, and our own weakness is
such, that we cannot defend ourselves.

15. Oh, that I knew how to describe the captivity of my soul in
those days!  I understood perfectly that I was in captivity, but
I could not understand the nature of it; neither could I entirely
believe that those things which my confessors did not make so
much of were so wrong as I in my soul felt them to be. One of
them--I had gone to him with a scruple--told me that, even if I
were raised to high contemplation, those occasions and
conversations were not unfitting for me.  This was towards the
end, when, by the grace of God, I was withdrawing more and more
from those great dangers, but not wholly from the occasions
of them.

16. When they saw my good desires, and how I occupied myself in
prayer, I seemed to them to have done much; but my soul knew that
this was not doing what I was bound to do for Him to Whom I owed
so much.  I am sorry for my poor soul even now, because of its
great sufferings, and the little help it had from any one except
God, and for the wide door that man opened for it, that it might
go forth to its pastimes and pleasures, when they said that these
things were lawful.

17. Then there was the torture of sermons, and that not a slight
one; for I was very fond of them.  If I heard any one preach well
and with unction, I felt, without my seeking it, a particular
affection for him, neither do I know whence it came.  Thus, no
sermon ever seemed to me so bad, but that I listened to it with
pleasure; though, according to others who heard it, the preaching
was not good.  If it was a good sermon, it was to me a most
special refreshment.  To speak of God, or to hear Him spoken of,
never wearied me.  I am speaking of the time after I gave myself
to prayer.  At one time I had great comfort in sermons, at
another they distressed me, because they made me feel that I was
very far from being what I ought to have been.

18. I used to pray to our Lord for help; but, as it now seems to
me, I must have committed the fault of not putting my whole trust
in His Majesty, and of not thoroughly distrusting myself.
I sought for help, took great pains; but it must be that I did
not understand how all is of little profit if we do not root out
all confidence in ourselves, and place it wholly in God. I wished
to live, but I saw clearly that I was not living, but rather
wrestling with the shadow of death; there was no one to give me
life, and I was not able to take it.  He Who could have given it
me had good reasons for not coming to my aid, seeing that He had
brought me back to Himself so many times, and I as often had
left Him.

Chapter IX.


The Means Whereby Our Lord Quickened Her Soul, Gave Her Light in
Her Darkness, and Made Her Strong in Goodness.


1. My soul was now grown weary; and the miserable habits it had
contracted would not suffer it to rest, though it was desirous of
doing so.  It came to pass one day, when I went into the oratory,
that I saw a picture which they had put by there, and which had
been procured for a certain feast observed in the house.  It was
a representation of Christ most grievously wounded; and so
devotional, that the very sight of it, when I saw it, moved
me--so well did it show forth that which He suffered for us.
So keenly did I feel the evil return I had made for those wounds,
that I thought my heart was breaking.  I threw myself on the
ground beside it, my tears flowing plenteously, and implored Him
to strengthen me once for all, so that I might never offend Him
any more.

2. I had a very great devotion to the glorious Magdalene, and
very frequently used to think of her conversion--especially when
I went to Communion.  As I knew for certain that our Lord was
then within me, I used to place myself at His feet, thinking that
my tears would not be despised.  I did not know what I was
saying; only He did great things for me, in that He was pleased I
should shed those tears, seeing that I so soon forgot that
impression.  I used to recommend myself to that glorious Saint,
that she might obtain my pardon.

3. But this last time, before that picture of which I am
speaking, I seem to have made greater progress; for I was now
very distrustful of myself, placing all my confidence in God.
It seems to me that I said to Him then that I would not rise up
till He granted my petition.  I do certainly believe that this
was of great service to me, because I have grown better
ever since. [1]

4. This was my method of prayer: as I could not make reflections
with my understanding, I contrived to picture Christ as within
me; [2] and I used to find myself the better for thinking of
those mysteries of His life during which He was most lonely.
It seemed to me that the being alone and afflicted, like a person
in trouble, must needs permit me to come near unto Him.

5. I did many simple things of this kind; and in particular I
used to find myself most at home in the prayer in the Garden,
whither I went in His company.  I thought of the bloody sweat,
and of the affliction He endured there; I wished, if it had been
possible, to wipe away that painful sweat from His face; but I
remember that I never dared to form such a resolution--my sins
stood before me so grievously.  I used to remain with Him there
as long as my thoughts allowed me, and I had many thoughts to
torment me.  For many years, nearly every night before I fell
asleep, when I recommended myself to God, that I might sleep in
peace, I used always to think a little of this mystery of the
prayer in the Garden--yea, even before I was a nun, because I had
been told that many indulgences were to be gained thereby.
For my part, I believe that my soul gained very much in this way,
because I began to practise prayer without knowing what it was;
and now that it had become my constant habit, I was saved from
omitting it, as I was from omitting to bless myself with the sign
of the cross before I slept.

6. And now to go back to what I was saying of the torture which
my thoughts inflicted upon me.  This method of praying, in which
the understanding makes no reflections, hath this property: the
soul must gain much, or lose.  I mean, that those who advance
without meditation, make great progress, because it is done by
love.  But to attain to this involves great labour, except to
those persons whom it is our Lord's good pleasure to lead quickly
to the prayer of quiet.  I know of some.  For those who walk in
this way, a book is profitable, that by the help thereof they may
the more quickly recollect themselves.  It was a help to me also
to look on fields, water, and flowers. [3] In them I saw traces
of the Creator--I mean, that the sight of these things was as a
book unto me; it roused me, made me recollected, and reminded me
of my ingratitude and of my sins.  My understanding was so dull,
that I could never represent in the imagination either heavenly
or high things in any form whatever until our Lord placed them
before me in another way. [4]

7. I was so little able to put things before me by the help of my
understanding, that, unless I saw a thing with my eyes, my
imagination was of no use whatever.  I could not do as others do,
who can put matters before themselves so as to become thereby
recollected.  I was able to think of Christ only as man.  But so
it was; and I never could form any image of Him to myself, though
I read much of His beauty, and looked at pictures of Him.  I was
like one who is blind, or in the dark, who, though speaking to a
person present, and feeling his presence, because he knows for
certain that he is present--I mean, that he understands him to be
present, and believes it--yet does not see him.  It was thus with
me when I used to think of our Lord.  This is why I was so fond
of images.  Wretched are they who, through their own fault, have
lost this blessing; it is clear enough that they do not love our
Lord--for if they loved Him, they would rejoice at the sight of
His picture, just as men find pleasure when they see the portrait
of one they love.

8. At this time, the Confessions of St. Augustine were given me.
Our Lord seems to have so ordained it, for I did not seek them
myself, neither had I ever seen them before.  I had a very great
devotion to St. Augustine, because the monastery in which I lived
when I was yet in the world was of his Order; [5] and also
because he had been a sinner--for I used to find great comfort in
those Saints whom, after they had sinned, our Lord converted to
Himself.  I thought they would help me, and that, as our Lord had
forgiven them, so also He would forgive me.  One thing, however,
there was that troubled me--I have spoken of it before [6]--our
Lord had called them but once, and they never relapsed; while my
relapses were now so many.  This it was that vexed me.
But calling to mind the love that He bore me, I took courage
again. Of His mercy I never doubted once, but I did very often
of myself.

9. O my God, I amazed at the hardness of my heart amidst so many
succours from Thee.  I am filled with dread when I see how little
I could do with myself, and how I was clogged, so that I could
not resolve to give myself entirely to God.  When I began to read
the Confessions, I thought I saw myself there described, and
began to recommend myself greatly to this glorious Saint. When I
came to his conversion, and read how he heard that voice in the
garden, it seemed to me nothing less than that our Lord had
uttered it for me: I felt so in my heart.  I remained for some
time lost in tears, in great inward affliction and distress. O my
God, what a soul has to suffer because it has lost the liberty it
had of being mistress over itself! and what torments it has to
endure!  I wonder now how I could live in torments so great: God
be praised Who gave me life, so that I might escape from so fatal
a death!  I believe that my soul obtained great strength from His
Divine Majesty, and that He must have heard my cry, and had
compassion upon so many tears.

10. A desire to spend more time with Him began to grow within me,
and also to withdraw from the occasions of sin: for as soon as I
had done so, I turned lovingly to His Majesty at once.
I understood clearly, as I thought, that I loved Him; but I did
not understand, as I ought to have understood it, wherein the
true love of God consists.  I do not think I had yet perfectly
disposed myself to seek His service when His Majesty turned
towards me with His consolations.  What others strive after with
great labour, our Lord seems to have looked out for a way to make
me willing to accept--that is, in these later years to give me
joy and comfort.  But as for asking our Lord to give me either
these things or sweetness in devotion, I never dared to do it;
the only thing I prayed Him to give me was the grace never to
offend Him, together with the forgiveness of my great sins.
When I saw that my sins were so great, I never ventured
deliberately to ask for consolation or for sweetness.  He had
compassion enough upon me, I think--and, in truth, He dealt with
me according to His great mercy--when He allowed me to stand
before Him, and when He drew me into His presence; for I saw
that, if He had not drawn me, I should not have come at all.

11. Once only in my life do I remember asking for consolation,
being at the time in great aridities.  When I considered what I
had done, I was so confounded, that the very distress I suffered
from seeing how little humility I had, brought me that which I
had been so bold as to ask for.  I knew well that it was lawful
to pray for it; but it seemed to me that it is lawful only for
those who are in good dispositions, who have sought with all
their might to attain to true devotion--that is, not to offend
God, and to be disposed and resolved for all goodness.  I looked
upon those tears of mine as womanish and weak, seeing that I did
not obtain my desires by them; nevertheless, I believe that they
did me some service; for, specially after those two occasions of
great compunction and sorrow of heart, [7] accompanied by tears,
of which I am speaking, I began in an especial way to give myself
more to prayer, and to occupy myself less with those things which
did me harm--though I did not give them up altogether.  But God
Himself, as I have just said, came to my aid, and helped me to
turn away from them.  As His Majesty was only waiting for some
preparation on my part, the spiritual graces grew in me as I
shall now explain.  It is not the custom of our Lord to give
these graces to any but to those who keep their consciences in
greater pureness. [8]

Chapter X.


The Graces She Received in Prayer.  What We Can Do Ourselves.
The Great Importance of Understanding What Our Lord Is Doing
for Us.  She Desires Her Confessors to Keep Her Writings Secret,
Because of the Special Graces of Our Lord to Her, Which They Had
Commanded Her to Describe.


1. I used to have at times, as I have said, [1] though it used to
pass quickly away--certain commencements of that which I am going
now to describe.  When I formed those pictures within myself of
throwing myself at the feet of Christ, as I said before, [2] and
sometimes even when I was reading, a feeling of the presence of
God would come over me unexpectedly, so that I could in no wise
doubt either that He was within me, or that I was wholly absorbed
in Him.  It was not by way of vision; I believe it was what is
called mystical theology.   The soul is suspended in such a way
that it seems to be utterly beside itself.  The will loves; the
memory, so it seems to me, is as it were lost; and the
understanding, so I think, makes no reflections--yet is not lost:
as I have just said, it is not at work, but it stands as if
amazed at the greatness of the things it understands; for God
wills it to understand that it understands nothing whatever of
that which His Majesty places before it.

2. Before this, I had a certain tenderness of soul which was very
abiding, partially attainable, I believe, in some measure, by our
own efforts: a consolation which is not wholly in the senses, nor
yet altogether in the spirit, but is all of it the gift of God.
However, I think we can contribute much towards the attaining of
it by considering our vileness and our ingratitude towards
God--the great things He has done for us--His Passion, with its
grievous pains--and His life, so full of sorrows; also, by
rejoicing in the contemplation of His works, of His greatness,
and of the love that He bears us.  Many other considerations
there are which he who really desires to make progress will often
stumble on, though he may not be very much on the watch for them.
If with this there be a little love, the soul is comforted, the
heart is softened, and tears flow.  Sometimes it seems that we do
violence to ourselves and weep; at other times, our Lord seems to
do so, so that we have no power to resist Him.  His Majesty seems
to reward this slight carefulness of ours with so grand a gift as
is this consolation which He ministers to the soul of seeing
itself weeping for so great a Lord.  I am not surprised; for the
soul has reason enough, and more than enough, for its joy.  Here
it comforts itself--here it rejoices.

3. The comparison which now presents itself seems to me to be
good.  These joys in prayer are like what those of heaven must
be.  As the vision of the saints, which is measured by their
merits there, reaches no further than our Lord wills, and as the
blessed see how little merit they had, every one of them is
satisfied with the place assigned him: there being the very
greatest difference between one joy and another in heaven, and
much greater than between one spiritual joy and another on
earth--which is, however, very great.  And in truth, in the
beginning, a soul in which God works this grace thinks that now
it has scarcely anything more to desire, and counts itself
abundantly rewarded for all the service it has rendered Him.
And there is reason for this: for one of those tears--which, as I
have just said, are almost in our own power, though without God
nothing can be done--cannot, in my opinion, be purchased with all
the labours of the world, because of the great gain it brings us.
And what greater gain can we have than some testimony of our
having pleased God?  Let him, then, who shall have attained to
this, give praise unto God--acknowledge himself to be one of His
greatest debtors; because it seems to be His will to take him
into His house, having chosen him for His kingdom, if he does not
turn back.

4. Let him not regard certain kinds of humility which exist, and
of which I mean to speak. [3]  Some think it humility not to
believe that God is bestowing His gifts upon them.  Let us
clearly understand this, and that it is perfectly clear God
bestows His gifts without any merit whatever on our part; and let
us be grateful to His Majesty for them; for if we do not
recognize the gifts received at His hands, we shall never be
moved to love Him.  It is a most certain truth, that the richer
we see ourselves to be, confessing at the same time our poverty,
the greater will be our progress, and the more real our humility.

5. An opposite course tends to take away all courage; for we
shall think ourselves incapable of great blessings, if we begin
to frighten ourselves with the dread of vain-glory when our Lord
begins to show His mercy upon us. [4]  Let us believe that He Who
gives these gifts will also, when the devil begins to tempt us
herein, give us the grace to detect him, and the strength to
resist him--that is, He will do so if we walk in simplicity
before God, aiming at pleasing Him only, and not men.  It is a
most evident truth, that our love for a person is greater, the
more distinctly we remember the good he has done us.

6. If, then, it is lawful, and so meritorious, always to remember
that we have our being from God, that He has created us out of
nothing, that He preserves us, and also to remember all the
benefits of His death and Passion, which He suffered long before
He made us for every one of us now alive--why should it not be
lawful for me to discern, confess, and consider often that I was
once accustomed to speak of vanities, and that now our Lord has
given me the grace to speak only of Himself?

7. Here, then, is a precious pearl, which, when we remember that
it is given us, and that we have it in possession, powerfully
invites us to love.  All this is the fruit of prayer founded on
humility.  What, then, will it be when we shall find ourselves in
possession of other pearls of greater price, such as contempt of
the world and of self, which some servants of God have already
received?  It is clear that such souls must consider themselves
greater debtors--under greater obligations to serve Him: we must
acknowledge that we have nothing of ourselves, and confess the
munificence of our Lord, Who, on a soul so wretched and poor, and
so utterly undeserving, as mine is,--for whom the first of these
pearls was enough, and more than enough,--would bestow greater
riches than I could desire.

8. We must renew our strength to serve Him, and strive not to be
ungrateful, because it is on this condition that our Lord
dispenses His treasures; for if we do not make a good use of
them, and of the high estate to which He raises us, He will
return and take them from us, and we shall be poorer than ever.
His Majesty will give the pearls to him who shall bring them
forth and employ them usefully for himself and others.  For how
shall he be useful, and how shall he spend liberally, who does
not know that he is rich?  It is not possible, I think, our
nature being what it is, that he can have the courage necessary
for great things who does not know that God is on his side; for
so miserable are we, so inclined to the things of this world,
that he can hardly have any real abhorrence of, with great
detachment from, all earthly things who does not see that he
holds some pledges for those things that are above.  It is by
these gifts that our Lord gives us that strength which we through
our sins have lost.

9. A man will hardly wish to be held in contempt and abhorrence,
nor will he seek after the other great virtues to which the
perfect attain, if he has not some pledges of the love which God
bears him, together with a living faith.  Our nature is so dead,
that we go after that which we see immediately before us; and it
is these graces, therefore, that quicken and strengthen our
faith.  It may well be that I, who am so wicked, measure others
by myself, and that others require nothing more than the verities
of the faith, in order to render their works most perfect; while
I, wretched that I am! have need of everything.

10. Others will explain this.  I speak from my own experience, as
I have been commanded; and if what I say be not correct, let
him [5] to whom I send it destroy it; for he knows better than I
do what is wrong in it.  I entreat him, for the love of our Lord,
to publish abroad what I have thus far said of my wretched life,
and of my sins.  I give him leave to do so; and to all my
confessors, also,--of whom he is one--to whom this is to be sent,
if it be their pleasure, even during my life, so that I may no
longer deceive people who think there must be some good in
me.  [6] Certainly, I speak in all sincerity, so far as I
understand myself.  Such publication will give me great comfort.

11. But as to that which I am now going to say, I give no such
leave; nor, if it be shown to any one, do I consent to its being
said who the person is whose experience it describes, nor who
wrote it.  This is why I mention neither my own name, nor that of
any other person whatever.  I have written it in the best way I
could, in order not to be known; and this I beg of them for the
love of God.  Persons so learned and grave as they are [7] have
authority enough to approve of whatever right things I may say,
should our Lord give me the grace to do so; and if I should say
anything of the kind, it will be His, and not mine--because I am
neither learned nor of good life, and I have no person of
learning or any other to teach me; for they only who ordered me
to write know that I am writing, and at this moment they are not
here.  I have, as it were, to steal the time, and that with
difficulty, because my writing hinders me from spinning.  I am
living in a house that is poor, and have many things to do. [8]
If, indeed, our Lord had given me greater abilities and a better
memory, I might then profit by what I have seen and read; but my
abilities are very slight.  If, then, I should say anything that
is right, our Lord will have it said for some good purpose; that
which may be wrong will be mine, and your reverence will strike
it out.

12. In neither case will it be of any use to publish my name:
during my life, it is clear that no good I may have done ought to
be told; after death, there is no reason against it, except that
it will lose all authority and credit, because related of a
person so vile and so wicked as I am.  And because I think your
reverence and the others who may see this writing will do this
that I ask of you, for the love of our Lord, I write with
freedom.  If it were not so, I should have great scruples, except
in declaring my sins: and in that matter I should have none at
all.  For the rest, it is enough that I am a woman to make my
sails droop: how much more, then, when I am a woman, and a
wicked one?

13. So, then, everything here beyond the simple story of my life
your reverence must take upon yourself--since you have so pressed
me to give some account of the graces which our Lord bestowed
upon me in prayer--if it be consistent with the truths of our
holy Catholic faith; if it be not, your reverence must burn it at
once--for I give my consent.  I will recount my experience, in
order that, if it be consistent with those truths, your reverence
may make some use of it; if not, you will deliver my soul from
delusion, so that Satan may gain nothing there where I seemed to
be gaining myself.  Our Lord knows well that I, as I shall show
hereafter, [9] have always laboured to find out those who could
give me light.

14. How clear soever I may wish to make my account of that which
relates to prayer, it will be obscure enough for those who are
without experience.  I shall speak of certain hindrances, which,
as I understand it, keep men from advancing on this road--and of
other things which are dangerous, as our Lord has taught me by
experience.  I have also discussed the matter with men of great
learning, with persons who for many years had lived spiritual
lives, who admit that, in the twenty-seven years only during
which I have given myself to prayer--though I walked so ill, and
stumbled so often on the road--His Majesty granted me that
experience which others attain to in seven-and-thirty, or
seven-and-forty, years; and they, too, being persons who ever
advanced in the way of penance and of virtue.

15. Blessed be God for all, and may His infinite Majesty make use
of me!  Our Lord knoweth well that I have no other end in this
than that He may be praised and magnified a little, when men
shall see that on a dunghill so foul and rank He has made a
garden of flowers so sweet.  May it please His Majesty that I may
not by my own fault root them out, and become again what I was
before.  And I entreat your reverence, for the love of our Lord,
to beg this of Him for me, seeing that you have a clearer
knowledge of what I am than you have allowed me to give of
myself here.

Chapter XI.


Why Men Do Not Attain Quickly to the Perfect Love of God.
Of Four Degrees of Prayer.  Of the First Degree.  The Doctrine
Profitable for Beginners, and for Those Who Have No
Sensible Sweetness.


1. I speak now of those who begin to be the servants of love;
that seems to me to be nothing else but to resolve to follow Him
in the way of prayer, who has loved us so much.  It is a dignity
so great, that I have a strange joy in thinking of it; for
servile fear vanishes at once, if we are, as we ought to be, in
the first degree.  O Lord of my soul, and my good, how is it
that, when a soul is determined to love Thee--doing all it can,
by forsaking all things, in order that it may the better occupy
itself with the love of God--it is not Thy will it should have
the joy of ascending at once to the possession of perfect love?
I have spoken amiss; I ought to have said, and my complaint
should have been, why is it we do not? for the fault is wholly
our own that we do not rejoice at once in a dignity so great,
seeing that the attaining to the perfect possession of this true
love brings all blessings with it.

2. We think so much of ourselves, and are so dilatory in giving
ourselves wholly to God, that, as His Majesty will not let us
have the fruition of that which is so precious but at a great
cost, so neither do we perfectly prepare ourselves for it.  I see
plainly that there is nothing by which so great a good can be
procured in this world.  If, however, we did what we could, not
clinging to anything upon earth, but having all our thoughts and
conversation in Heaven, I believe that this blessing would
quickly be given us, provided we perfectly prepared ourselves for
it at once, as some of the saints have done.  We think we are
giving all to God; but, in fact, we are offering only the revenue
or the produce, while we retain the fee-simple of the land in our
own possession.

3. We resolve to become poor, and it is a resolution of great
merit; but we very often take great care not to be in want, not
simply of what is necessary, but of what is superfluous: yea, and
to make for ourselves friends who may supply us; and in this way
we take more pains, and perhaps expose ourselves to greater
danger, in order that we may want nothing, than we did formerly,
when we had our own possessions in our own power.

4. We thought, also, that we gave up all desire of honour when we
became religious, or when we began the spiritual life, and
followed after perfection; and yet, when we are touched on the
point of honour, we do not then remember that we had given it up
to God.  We would seize it again, and take it, as they say, out
of His Hands, even after we had made Him, to all appearance, the
Lord of our own will.  So is it in every thing else.

5. A pleasant way this of seeking the love of God! we retain our
own affections, and yet will have that love, as they say, by
handfuls.  We make no efforts to bring our desires to good
effect, or to raise them resolutely above the earth; and yet,
with all this, we must have many spiritual consolations.  This is
not well, and we are seeking things that are incompatible one
with the other.  So, because we do not give ourselves up wholly
and at once, this treasure is not given wholly and at once to us.
May it be the good pleasure of our Lord to give it us drop by
drop, though it may cost us all the trials in the world.

6. He showeth great mercy unto him to whom He gives the grace and
resolution to strive for this blessing with all his might; for
God withholds Himself from no one who perseveres.  He will by
little and little strengthen that soul, so that it may come forth
victorious.  I say resolution, because of the multitude of those
things which Satan puts before it at first, to keep it back from
beginning to travel on this road; for he knoweth what harm will
befall him thereby--he will lose not only that soul, but many
others also.  If he who enters on this road does violence to
himself, with the help of God, so as to reach the summit of
perfection, such a one, I believe, will never go alone to Heaven;
he will always take many with him: God gives to him, as to a good
captain, those who shall be of his company.

7. Thus, then, the dangers and difficulties which Satan puts
before them are so many, that they have need, not of a little,
but of a very great, resolution, and great grace from God, to
save them from falling away.

8. Speaking, then, of their beginnings who are determined to
follow after this good, and to succeed in their enterprise--what
I began to say [1] of mystical theology--I believe they call it
by that name--I shall proceed with hereafter--I have to say that
the labour is greatest at first; for it is they who toil, our
Lord, indeed, giving them strength.  In the other degrees of
prayer, there is more of fruition; although they who are in the
beginning, the middle, and the end, have their crosses to carry:
the crosses, however, are different.  They who would follow
Christ, if they do not wish to be lost, must walk in the way He
walked Himself.  Blessed labours! even here, in this life, so
superabundantly rewarded!

9. I shall have to make use of a comparison; I should like to
avoid it, because I am a woman, and write simply what I have been
commanded.  But this language of spirituality is so difficult of
utterance for those who are not learned, and such am I.  I have
therefore to seek for some means to make the matter plain.
It may be that the comparison will very rarely be to the
purpose--your reverence will be amused when you see my stupidity.
I think, now, I have either read or heard of this comparison; but
as my memory is bad, I know not where, nor on what occasion;
however, I am satisfied with it for my present purpose. [2]

10. A beginner must look upon himself as making a garden, wherein
our Lord may take His delight, but in a soil unfruitful, and
abounding in weeds.  His Majesty roots up the weeds, and has to
plant good herbs.  Let us, then, take for granted that this is
already done when a soul is determined to give itself to prayer,
and has begun the practice of it.  We have, then, as good
gardeners, by the help of God, to see that the plants grow, to
water them carefully, that they may not die, but produce
blossoms, which shall send forth much fragrance, refreshing to
our Lord, so that He may come often for His pleasure into this
garden, and delight Himself in the midst of these virtues.

11. Let us now see how this garden is to be watered, that we may
understand what we have to do: how much trouble it will cost us,
whether the gain be greater than the trouble, or how long a time
it will take us.  It seems to me that the garden may be watered
in four ways: by water taken out of a well, which is very
laborious; or with water raised by means of an engine and
buckets, drawn by a windlass--I have drawn it this way
sometimes--it is a less troublesome way than the first, and gives
more water; or by a stream or brook, whereby the garden is
watered in a much better way--for the soil is more thoroughly
saturated, and there is no necessity to water it so often, and
the labour of the gardener is much less; or by showers of rain,
when our Lord Himself waters it, without labour on our part--and
this way is incomparably better than all the others of which I
have spoken.

12. Now, then, for the application of these four ways of
irrigation by which the garden is to be maintained; for without
water it must fail.  The comparison is to my purpose, and it
seems to me that by the help of it I shall be able to explain, in
some measure, the four degrees of prayer to which our Lord, of
His goodness, has occasionally raised my soul.  May He graciously
grant that I may so speak as to be of some service to one of
those who has commanded me to write, whom our Lord has raised in
four months to a greater height than I have reached in seventeen
years!  He prepared himself better than I did, and therefore is
his garden without labour on his part, irrigated by these four
waters--though the last of them is only drop by drop; but it is
growing in such a way, that soon, by the help of our Lord, he
will be swallowed up therein, and it will be a pleasure to me, if
he finds my explanation absurd, that he should laugh at it.

13. Of those who are beginners in prayer, we may say, that they
are those who draw the water up out of the well--a process which,
as I have said, is very laborious; for they must be wearied in
keeping the senses recollected, and this is a great labour,
because the senses have been hitherto accustomed to distractions.
It is necessary for beginners to accustom themselves to disregard
what they hear or see, and to put it away from them during the
time of prayer; they must be alone, and in retirement think over
their past life.  Though all must do this many times, beginners
as well as those more advanced; all, however, must not do so
equally, as I shall show hereafter. [3] Beginners at first suffer
much, because they are not convinced that they are penitent for
their sins; and yet they are, because they are so sincerely
resolved on serving God.  They must strive to meditate on the
life of Christ, and the understanding is wearied thereby.
Thus far we can advance of ourselves--that is, by the grace of
God--for without that, as every one knows, we never can have one
good thought.

14. This is beginning to draw water up out of the well.
God grant there may be water in it!  That, however, does not
depend on us; we are drawing it, and doing what we can towards
watering the flowers.  So good is God, that when, for reasons
known to His Majesty--perhaps for our greater good--it is His
will the well should be dry, He Himself preserves the flowers
without water--we, like good gardeners, doing what lies in our
power--and makes our virtues grow.  By water here I mean tears,
and if there be none, then tenderness and an inward feeling
of devotion.

15. What, then, will he do here who sees that, for many days, he
is conscious only of aridity, disgust, dislike, and so great an
unwillingness to go to the well for water, that he would give it
up altogether, if he did not remember that he has to please and
serve the Lord of the garden; if he did not trust that his
service was not in vain, and did not hope for some gain by a
labour so great as that of lowering the bucket into the well so
often, and drawing it up without water in it?  It will happen
that he is often unable to move his arms for that purpose, or to
have one good thought: working with the understanding is drawing
water out of the well.

16. What, then, once more, will the gardener do now?  He must
rejoice and take comfort, and consider it as the greatest favour
to labour in the garden of so great an Emperor; and as he knows
that he is pleasing Him in the matter--and his purpose must not
be to please himself, but Him--let him praise Him greatly for the
trust He has in him--for He sees that, without any recompense, he
is taking so much care of that which has been confided to him;
let him help Him to carry the Cross, and let him think how He
carried it all His life long; let him not seek his kingdom here,
nor ever intermit his prayer; and so let him resolve, if this
aridity should last even his whole life long, never to let Christ
fall down beneath the Cross. [4]

17. The time will come when he shall be paid once for all.
Let him have no fear that his labour is in vain: he serves a good
Master, Whose eyes are upon him.  Let him make no account of evil
thoughts, but remember that Satan suggested them to St. Jerome
also in the desert. [5]  These labours have their reward, I know
it; for I am one who underwent them for many years.  When I drew
but one drop of water out of this blessed well, I considered it
was a mercy of God.  I know these labours are very great, and
require, I think, greater courage than many others in this world;
but I have seen clearly that God does not leave them without a
great recompense, even in this life; for it is very certain that
in one hour, during which our Lord  gave me to taste His
sweetness, all the anxieties which I had to bear when persevering
in prayer seem to me ever afterwards perfectly rewarded.

18. I believe that it is our Lord's good pleasure frequently in
the beginning, and at times in the end, to send these torments,
and many other incidental temptations, to try those who love Him,
and to ascertain if they will drink the chalice, [6] and help Him
to carry the Cross, before He intrusts them with His great
treasures.  I believe it to be for our good that His Majesty
should lead us by this way, so that we may perfectly understand
how worthless we are; for the graces which He gives afterwards
are of a dignity so great, that He will have us by experience
know our wretchedness before He grants them, that it may not be
with us as it was with Lucifer.

19. What canst Thou do, O my Lord, that is not for the greater
good of that soul which Thou knowest to be already Thine, and
which gives itself up to Thee to follow Thee whithersoever Thou
goest, even to the death of the Cross; and which is determined to
help Thee to carry that Cross, and not to leave Thee alone with
it?  He who shall discern this resolution in himself has nothing
to fear: no, no; spiritual people have nothing to fear.  There is
no reason why he should be distressed who is already raised to so
high a degree as this is of wishing to converse in solitude with
God, and to abandon the amusements of the world.  The greater
part of the work is done; give praise to His Majesty for it, and
trust in His goodness who has never failed those who love Him.
Close the eyes of your imagination, and do not ask why He gives
devotion to this person in so short a time, and none to me after
so many years.  Let us believe that all is for our greater good;
let His Majesty guide us whithersoever He will: we are not our
own, but His.  He shows us mercy enough when it is His pleasure
we should be willing to dig in His garden, and to be so near the
Lord of it: He certainly is near to us.  If it be His will that
these plants and flowers should grow--some of them when He gives
water we may draw from the well, others when He gives none--what
is that to me?  Do Thou, O Lord, accomplish Thy will; let me
never offend Thee, nor let my virtues perish; if Thou hast given
me any, it is out of Thy mere goodness.  I wish to suffer,
because Thou, O Lord, hast suffered; do Thou in every way fulfil
Thy will in me, and may it never be the pleasure of Thy Majesty
that a gift of so high a price as that of Thy love, be given to
people who serve Thee only because of the sweetness they
find thereby.

20. It is much to be observed, and I say so because I know by
experience, that the soul which, begins to walk in the way of
mental prayer with resolution, and is determined not to care
much, neither to rejoice nor to be greatly afflicted, whether
sweetness and tenderness fail it, or our Lord grants them, has
already travelled a great part of the road.  Let that soul, then,
have no fear that it is going back, though it may frequently
stumble; for the building is begun on a firm foundation.  It is
certain that the love of God does not consist in tears, nor in
this sweetness and tenderness which we for the most part desire,
and with which we console ourselves; but rather in serving Him in
justice, fortitude, and humility.  That seems to me to be a
receiving rather than a giving of anything on our part.

21. As for poor women, such as I am, weak and infirm of purpose,
it seems to me to be necessary that I should be led on through
consolations, as God is doing now, so that I might be able to
endure certain afflictions which it has pleased His Majesty I
should have.  But when the servants of God, who are men of
weight, learning, and sense, make so much account, as I see they
do, whether God gives them sweetness in devotion or not, I am
disgusted when I listen to them.  I do not say that they ought
not to accept it, and make much of it, when God gives
it--because, when He gives it, His Majesty sees it to be
necessary for them--but I do say that they ought not to grow
weary when they have it not.  They should then understand that
they have no need of it, and be masters of themselves, when His
Majesty does not give it.  Let them be convinced of this, there
is a fault here; I have had experience of it, and know it to be
so.  Let them believe it as an imperfection: they are not
advancing in liberty of spirit, but shrinking like cowards from
the assault.

22. It is not so much to beginners that I say this--though I do
insist upon it, because it is of great importance to them that
they should begin with this liberty and resolution--as to others,
of whom there are many, who make a beginning, but never come to
the end; and that is owing, I believe, in great measure, to their
not having embraced the Cross from the first.  They are
distressed, thinking they are doing nothing; the understanding
ceases from its acts, and they cannot bear it.  Yet, perhaps, at
that very time, the will is feeding and gathering strength, and
they know it not.

23. We must suppose that our Lord does not regard these things;
for though they seem to us to be faults, yet they are not.
His Majesty knoweth our misery and natural vileness better than
we do ourselves.  He knoweth that these souls long to be always
thinking of Him and loving Him.  It is this resolution that He
seeks in us; the other anxieties which we inflict upon ourselves
serve to no other end but to disquiet the soul--which, if it be
unable to derive any profit in one hour, will by them be disabled
for four.  This comes most frequently from bodily
indisposition--I have had very great experience in the matter,
and I know it is true; for I have carefully observed it and
discussed it afterwards with spiritual persons--for we are so
wretched, that this poor prisoner of a soul shares in the
miseries of the body. The changes of the seasons, and the
alterations of the humours, very often compel it, without fault
of its own, not to do what it would, but rather to suffer in
every way.  Meanwhile, the more we force the soul on these
occasions, the greater the mischief, and the longer it lasts.
Some discretion must be used, in order to ascertain whether
ill-health be the occasion or not.  The poor soul must not be
stifled.  Let those who thus suffer understand that they are ill;
a change should be made in the hour of prayer, and oftentimes
that change should be continued for some days. Let souls pass out
of this desert as they can, for it is very often the misery of
one that loves God to see itself living in such wretchedness,
unable to do what it would, because it has to keep so evil a
guest as the body.

24. I spoke of discretion, because sometimes the devil will do
the same work; and so it is not always right to omit prayer when
the understanding is greatly distracted and disturbed, nor to
torment the soul to the doing of that which is out of its power.
There are other things then to be done--exterior works, as of
charity and spiritual reading--though at times the soul will not
be able to do them.  Take care, then, of the body, for the love
of God, because at many other times the body must serve the soul;
and let recourse be had to some recreations--holy ones--such as
conversation, or going out into the fields, as the confessor
shall advise.  Altogether, experience is a great matter, and it
makes us understand what is convenient for us. Let God be served
in all things--His yoke is sweet; [7] and it is of great
importance that the soul should not be dragged, as they say, but
carried gently, that it may make greater progress.

25. So, then, I come back to what I advised before [8]--and
though I repeat it often, it matters not; it is of great
importance that no one should distress himself on account of
aridities, or because his thoughts are restless and distracted;
neither should he be afflicted thereat, if he would attain to
liberty of spirit, and not be always in trouble.  Let him begin
by not being afraid of the Cross, and he will see how our Lord
will help him to carry it, how joyfully he will advance, and what
profit he will derive from it all.  It is now clear, if there is
no water in the well, that we at least can put none into it.
It is true we must not be careless about drawing it when there is
any in it, because at that time it is the will of God to multiply
our virtues by means thereof.

Chapter XII.


What We Can Ourselves Do.  The Evil of Desiring to Attain to
Supernatural States Before Our Lord Calls Us.


1. My aim in the foregoing chapter--though I digressed to many
other matters, because they seemed to me very necessary--was to
explain how much we may attain to of ourselves; and how, in these
beginnings of devotion, we are able in some degree to help
ourselves: because thinking of, and pondering on, the sufferings
of our Lord for our sakes moves us to compassion, and the sorrow
and tears which result therefrom are sweet.  The thought of the
blessedness we hope for, of the love our Lord bore us, and of His
resurrection, kindle within us a joy which is neither wholly
spiritual nor wholly sensual; but the joy is virtuous, and the
sorrow is most meritorious.

2. Of this kind are all those things which produce a devotion
acquired in part by means of the understanding, though it can
neither be merited nor had, if God grants it not.  It is best for
a soul which God has not raised to a higher state than this not
to try to rise of itself.  Let this be well considered, because
all the soul will gain in that way will be a loss.  In this state
it can make many acts of good resolutions to do much for God, and
enkindle its love; other acts also, which may help the growth of
virtues, according to that which is written in a book called The
Art of Serving God, [1] a most excellent work, and profitable for
those who are in this state, because the understanding is
active now.

3. The soul may also place itself in the presence of Christ, and
accustom itself to many acts of love directed to His sacred
Humanity, and remain in His presence continually, and speak to
Him, pray to Him in its necessities, and complain to Him of its
troubles; be merry with Him in its joys, and yet not forget Him
because of its joys.  All this it may do without set prayers, but
rather with words befitting its desires and its needs.

4. This is an excellent way whereby to advance, and that very
quickly.  He that will strive to have this precious
companionship, and will make much of it, and will sincerely love
our Lord, to whom we owe so much, is one, in my opinion, who has
made some progress.  There is therefore no reason why we should
trouble ourselves because we have no sensible devotion, as I said
before. [2]  But let us rather give thanks to our Lord, who
allows us to have a desire to please Him, though our works be
poor. This practice of the presence of Christ is profitable in
all states of prayer, and is a most safe way of advancing in the
first state, and of attaining quickly to the second; and as for
the last states, it secures us against those risks which the
devil may occasion.

5. This, then, is what we can do.  He who would pass out of this
state, and upraise his spirit, in order to taste consolations
denied him, will, in my opinion, lose both the one and the
other. [3]  These consolations being supernatural, and the
understanding inactive, the soul is then left desolate and in
great aridity.  As the foundation of the whole building is
humility, the nearer we draw unto God the more this virtue should
grow; if it does not, everything is lost.  It seems to be a kind
of pride when we seek to ascend higher, seeing that God descends
so low, when He allows us, being what we are, to draw near
unto Him.

6. It must not be supposed that I am now speaking of raising our
thoughts to the consideration of the high things of heaven and of
its glory, or unto God and His great wisdom.  I never did this
myself, because I had not the capacity for it--as I said
before; [4] and I was so worthless, that, as to thinking even of
the things of earth, God gave me grace to understand this truth:
that in me it was no slight boldness to do so.  How much more,
then, the thinking of heavenly things?  Others, however, will
profit in that way, particularly those who are learned; for
learning, in my opinion, is a great treasury in the matter of
this exercise, if it be accompanied with humility.  I observed
this a few days ago in some learned men who had shortly before
made a beginning, and had made great progress.  This is the
reason why I am so very anxious that many learned men may become
spiritual. I shall speak of this by and by. [5]

7. What I am saying--namely, let them not rise if God does not
raise them--is the language of spirituality.  He will understand
me who has had any experience; and I know not how to explain it,
if what I have said does not make it plain.

8. In mystical theology--of which I spoke before [6]--the
understanding ceases from its acts, because God suspends it--as I
shall explain by and by, if I can; [7] and God give me the grace
to do so.  We must neither imagine nor think that we can of
ourselves bring about this suspension.  That is what I say must
not be done; nor must we allow the understanding to cease from
its acts; for in that case we shall be stupid and cold, and the
result will be neither the one nor the other.  For when our Lord
suspends the understanding, and makes it cease from its acts, He
puts before it that which astonishes and occupies it: so that
without making any reflections, it shall comprehend in a
moment [8] more than we could comprehend in many years with all
the efforts in the world.

9. To have the powers of the mind occupied, and to think that you
can keep them at the same time quiet, is folly.  I repeat it,
though it be not so understood, there is no great humility in
this; and, if it be blameless, it is not left unpunished--it is
labour thrown away, and the soul is a little disgusted: it feels
like a man about to take a leap, and is held back.  Such a one
seems to have used up his strength already, and finds himself
unable to do that which he wished to have done: so here, in the
scanty gain that remains, he who will consider the matter will
trace that slight want of humility of which I have spoken; [9]
for that virtue has this excellence: there is no good work
attended by humility that leaves the soul disgusted.  It seems to
me that I have made this clear enough; yet, after all, perhaps
only for myself.  May our Lord open their eyes who read this, by
giving them experience; and then however slight that experience
may be, they will immediately understand it.

10. For many years I read much, and understood nothing; and for a
long time, too, though God gave me understanding herein, I never
could utter a word by which I might explain it to others.
This was no little trouble to me.  When His Majesty pleases, He
teaches everything in a moment, so that I am lost in wonder.
One thing I can truly say: though I conversed with many spiritual
persons, who sought to make me understand what our Lord was
giving me, in order that I might be able to speak of it, the fact
is, that my dulness was so great, that I derived no advantage
whatever, much or little, from their teaching.

11. Or it may be, as His Majesty has always been my Master--may
He be blessed for ever! for I am ashamed of myself that I can say
so with truth--that it was His good pleasure I should meet with
no one to whom I should be indebted in this matter.  So, without
my wishing or asking it--I never was careful about this, for that
would have been a virtue in me, but only about vanity--God gave
me to understand with all distinctness in a moment, and also
enabled me to express myself, so that my confessors were
astonished but I more than they, because I knew my own dulness
better.  It is not long since this happened.  And so that which
our Lord has not taught me, I seek not to know it, unless it be a
matter that touches my conscience.

12. Again I repeat my advice: it is of great moment not to raise
our spirit ourselves, if our Lord does not raise it for us; and
if He does, there can be no mistaking it.  For women, it is
specially wrong, because the devil can delude them--though I am
certain our Lord will never allow him to hurt any one who labours
to draw near unto God in humility.  On the contrary, such a one
will derive more profit and advantage out of that attack by which
Satan intended to hurt him.

13. I have dwelt so long upon this matter because this way of
prayer is the most common with beginners, and because the advice
I have given is very important.  It will be found much better
given elsewhere: that I admit; and I admit, also, that in writing
it I am ashamed of myself, and covered with confusion--though not
so much so as I ought to be.  Blessed for ever be our Lord, of
whose will and pleasure it is that I am allowed, being what I am,
to speak of things which are His, of such a nature, and so deep.

Chapter XIII.


Of Certain Temptations of Satan.  Instructions Relating Thereto.


1. I have thought it right to speak of certain temptations I have
observed to which beginners are liable--some of them I have had
myself--and to give some advice about certain things which to me
seem necessary.  In the beginning, then, we should strive to be
cheerful and unconstrained; for there are people who think it is
all over with devotion if they relax themselves ever so little.
It is right to be afraid of self; so that, having no confidence
in ourselves, much or little, we may not place ourselves in those
circumstances wherein men usually sin against God; for it is a
most necessary fear, till we become very perfect in virtue.
And there are not many who are so perfect as to be able to relax
themselves on those occasions which offer temptations to their
natural temper; for always while we live, were it only to
preserve humility, it is well we should know our own miserable
nature; but there are many occasions on which it is permitted
us--as I said just now [1]--to take some recreation, in order
that we may with more vigour resume our prayer.

2. Discretion is necessary throughout.  We must have great
confidence; because it is very necessary for us not to contract
our desires, but put our trust in God; for, if we do violence to
ourselves by little and little, we shall, though not at once,
reach that height which many Saints by His grace have reached.
If they had never resolved to desire, and had never by little and
little acted upon that resolve, they never could have ascended to
so high a state.

3. His Majesty seeks and loves courageous souls; but they must be
humble in their ways, and have no confidence in themselves.
I never saw one of those lag behind on the road; and never a
cowardly soul, though aided by humility, make that progress in
many years which the former makes in a few.  I am astonished at
the great things done on this road by encouraging oneself to
undertake great things, though we may not have the strength for
them at once; the soul takes a flight upwards and ascends high,
though, like a little bird whose wings are weak, it grows weary
and rests.

4. At one time I used often to think of those words of St. Paul:
"That all things are possible in God." [2]  I saw clearly that of
myself I could do nothing.  This was of great service to me.
So also was the saying of St. Augustine: "Give me, O Lord, what
Thou commandest, and command what Thou wilt." [3]  I was often
thinking how St. Peter lost nothing by throwing himself into the
sea, though he was afterwards afraid. [4]  These first
resolutions are a great matter--although it is necessary in the
beginning that we should be very reserved, controlled by the
discretion and authority of a director; but we must take care
that he be one who does not teach us to crawl like toads, nor one
who may be satisfied when the soul shows itself fit only to catch
lizards.  Humility must always go before: so that we may know
that this strength can come out of no strength of our own.

5. But it is necessary we should understand what manner of
humility this should be, because Satan, I believe, does great
harm; for he hinders those who begin to pray from going onwards,
by suggesting to them false notions of humility.  He makes them
think it is pride to have large desires, to wish to imitate the
Saints, and to long for martyrdom.  He tells us forthwith, or he
makes us think, that the actions of the Saints are to be admired,
not to be imitated, by us who are sinners.  I, too, say the same
thing; but we must see what those actions are which we are to
admire, and what those are which we are to imitate; for it would
be wrong in a person who is weak and sickly to undertake much
fasting and sharp penances to retire into the desert, where he
could not sleep, nor find anything to eat; or, indeed, to
undertake any austerities of this kind.

6. But we ought to think that we can force ourselves, by the
grace of God, to hold the world in profound contempt--to make
light of honour, and be detached from our possessions.
Our hearts, however, are so mean that we think the earth would
fail us under our feet, if we were to cease to care even for a
moment for the body, and give ourselves up to spirituality.
Then we think that to have all we require contributes to
recollection, because anxieties disturb prayer.  It is painful to
me that our confidence in God is so scanty, and our self-love so
strong, as that any anxiety about our own necessities should
disturb us. But so it is; for when our spiritual progress is so
slight, a mere nothing will give us as much trouble as great and
important matters will give to others.  And we think
ourselves spiritual!

7. Now, to me, this way of going on seems to betray a disposition
to reconcile soul and body together, in order that we may not
miss our ease in this world, and yet have the fruition of God in
the next; and so it will be if we walk according to justice,
clinging to virtue; but it is the pace of a hen--it will never
bring us to liberty of spirit.  It is a course of proceeding, as
it seems to me, most excellent for those who are in the married
state, and who must live according to their vocation; but for the
other state, I by no means wish for such a method of progress,
neither can I be made to believe it to be sound; for I have tried
it, and I should have remained in that way, if our Lord in His
goodness had not taught me another and a shorter road.

8. Though, in the matter of desires, I always had generous ones;
but I laboured, as I said before, [5] to make my prayer, and, at
the same time, to live at my ease.  If there had been any one to
rouse me to a higher flight, he might have brought me, so I
think, to a state in which these desires might have had their
effects; but, for our sins, so few and so rare are they whose
discretion in that matter is not excessive.  That, I believe, is
reason enough why those who begin do not attain more quickly to
great perfection; for our Lord never fails us, and it is not His
fault; the fault and the wretchedness of this being all our own.

9. We may also imitate the Saints by striving after solitude and
silence, and many other virtues that will not kill these wretched
bodies of ours, which insist on being treated so orderly, that
they may disorder the soul; and Satan, too, helps much to make
them unmanageable.  When he sees us a little anxious about them,
he wants nothing more to convince us that our way of life must
kill us, and destroy our health; even if we weep, he makes us
afraid of blindness.  I have passed through this, and therefore I
know it; but I know of no better sight or better health that we
can desire, than the loss of both in such a cause. Being myself
so sickly, I was always under constraint, and good for nothing,
till I resolved to make no account of my body nor of my health;
even now I am worthless enough.

10. But when it pleased God to let me find out this device of
Satan, I used to say to the latter, when he suggested to me that
I was ruining my health, that my death was of no consequence;
when he suggested rest, I replied that I did not want rest, but
the Cross.  His other suggestions I treated in the same way.
I saw clearly that in most things, though I was really very
sickly, it was either a temptation of Satan, or a weakness on my
part. My health has been much better since I have ceased to look
after my ease and comforts.  It is of great importance not to let
our own thoughts frighten us in the beginning, when we set
ourselves to pray.  Believe me in this, for I know it by
experience.  As a warning to others, it may be that this story of
my failures may be useful.

11. There is another temptation, which is very common: when
people begin to have pleasure in the rest and the fruit of
prayer, they will have everybody else be very spiritual also.
Now, to desire this is not wrong, but to try to bring it about
may not be right, except with great discretion and with much
reserve, without any appearance of teaching.  He who would do any
good in this matter ought to be endowed with solid virtues, that
he may not put temptation in the way of others.  It happened to
me--that is how I know it--when, as I said before, [6] I made
others apply themselves to prayer, to be a source of temptation
and disorder; for, on the one hand, they heard me say great
things of the blessedness of prayer, and, on the other, saw how
poor I was in virtue, notwithstanding my prayer.  They had good
reasons on their side, and afterwards they told me of it; for
they knew not how these things could be compatible one with the
other.  This it was that made them not to regard that as evil
which was really so in itself, namely, that they saw me do it
myself, now and then, during the time that they thought well of
me in some measure.

12. This is Satan's work: he seems to take advantage of the
virtues we may have, for the purpose of giving a sanction, so far
as he can, to the evil he aims at; how slight soever that evil
may be, his gain must be great, if it prevail in a religious
house.  How much, then, must his gain have been, when the evil I
did was so very great!  And thus, during many years, only three
persons were the better for what I said to them; but now that our
Lord has made me stronger in virtue, in the course of two or
three years many persons have profited, as I shall
show hereafter. [7]

13. There is another great inconvenience in addition to this: the
loss to our own soul; for the utmost we have to do in the
beginning is to take care of our own soul only, and consider that
in the whole world there is only God and our soul.  This is a
point of great importance.

14. There is another temptation--we ought to be aware of it, and
be cautious in our conduct: persons are carried away by a zeal
for virtue, through the pain which the sight of the sins and
failings of others occasions them.  Satan tells them that this
pain arises only out of their desire that God may not be
offended, and out of their anxiety about His honour; so they
immediately seek to remedy the evil.  This so disturbs them, that
they cannot pray.  The greatest evil of all is their thinking
this an act of virtue, of perfection, and of a great zeal for
God.  I am not speaking of the pain which public sins occasion,
if they be habitual in any community, nor of wrongs done to the
Church, nor of heresies by which so many souls are visibly lost;
for this pain is most wholesome, and being wholesome is no source
of disquiet.  The security, therefore, of that soul which would
apply itself to prayer lies in casting away from itself all
anxiety about persons and things, in taking care of itself, and
in pleasing God.  This is the most profitable course.

15. If I were to speak of the mistakes which I have seen people
make, in reliance on their own good intentions, I should never
come to an end.  Let us labour, therefore, always to consider the
virtues and the good qualities which we discern in others, and
with our own great sins cover our eyes, so that we may see none
of their failings.  This is one way of doing our work; and though
we may not be perfect in it at once, we shall acquire one great
virtue--we shall look upon all men as better than ourselves; and
we begin to acquire that virtue in this way, by the grace of God,
which is necessary in all things--for when we have it not, all
our endeavours are in vain--and by imploring Him to give us this
virtue; for He never fails us, if we do what we can.

16. This advice, also, they must take into their consideration
who make much use of their understanding, eliciting from one
subject many thoughts and conceptions.  As to those who, like
myself, cannot do it, I have no advice to give, except that they
are to have patience, until our Lord shall send them both matter
and light; for they can do so little of themselves, that their
understanding is a hindrance to them rather than a help.

17. To those, then, who can make use of their understanding, I
say that they are not to spend the whole time in that way; for
though it be most meritorious, yet they must not, when prayer is
sweet, suppose that there never will be a Sunday or a time when
no work ought to be done.  They think it lost time to do
otherwise; but I think that loss their greatest gain.  Let them
rather, as I have said, [8] place themselves in the presence of
Christ, and, without fatiguing the understanding, converse with
Him, and in Him rejoice, without wearying themselves in searching
out reasons; but let them rather lay their necessities before
Him, and the just reasons there are why He should not suffer us
in His presence: at one time this, at another time that, lest the
soul should be wearied by always eating of the same food.  These
meats are most savoury and wholesome, if the palate be accustomed
to them; they will furnish a great support for the life of the
soul, and they have many other advantages also.

18. I will explain myself further; for the doctrine of prayer is
difficult, and, without a director, very hard to understand.
Though I would willingly be concise, and though a mere hint is
enough for his clear intellect who has commanded me to write on
the subject of prayer, yet so it is, my dulness does not allow me
to say or explain in a few words that which it is so important to
explain well.  I, who have gone through so much, am sorry for
those who begin only with books; for there is a strange
difference between that which we learn by reading, and that which
we learn by experience.

19. Going back, then, to what I was saying.  We set ourselves to
meditate upon some mystery of the Passion: let us say, our Lord
at the pillar.  The understanding goeth about seeking for the
sources out of which came the great dolours and the bitter
anguish which His Majesty endured in that desolation.
It considers that mystery in many lights, which the intellect, if
it be skilled in its work, or furnished with learning, may there
obtain.  This is a method of prayer which should be to everyone
the beginning, the middle, and the end: a most excellent and safe
way, until our Lord shall guide them to other supernatural ways.

20. I say to all, because there are many souls who make greater
progress by meditation on other subjects than on the Sacred
Passion; for as there are many mansions in heaven, so there are
also many roads leading thither.  Some persons advance by
considering themselves in hell, others in heaven--and these are
distressed by meditations on hell.  Others meditate on death;
some persons, if tender-hearted, are greatly fatigued by
continual meditations on the Passion; but are consoled and make
progress when they meditate on the power and greatness of God in
His creatures, and on His love visible in all things.  This is an
admirable method--not omitting, however, from time to time, the
Passion and Life of Christ, the Source of all good that ever
came, and that ever shall come.

21. He who begins is in need of instruction, whereby he may
ascertain what profits him most.  For this end it is very
necessary he should have a director, who ought to be a person of
experience; for if he be not, he will make many mistakes, and
direct a soul without understanding its ways, or suffering it to
understand them itself; for such a soul, knowing that obedience
to a director is highly meritorious, dares not transgress the
commandments it receives.  I have met with souls cramped and
tormented, because he who directed them had no experience: that
made me sorry for them.  Some of them knew not what to do with
themselves; for directors who do not understand the spirit of
their penitents afflict them soul and body, and hinder
their progress. [9]

22. One person I had to do with had been kept by her director for
eight years, as it were, in prison; he would not allow her to
quit the subject of self-knowledge; and yet our Lord had already
raised her to the prayer of quiet; so she had much to suffer.

23. Although this matter of self-knowledge must never be put
aside--for there is no soul so great a giant on this road but has
frequent need to turn back, and be again an infant at the breast;
and this must never be forgotten.  I shall repeat it, [10]
perhaps, many times, because of its great importance--for among
all the states of prayer, however high they may be, there is not
one in which it is not often necessary to go back to the
beginning.  The knowledge of our sins, and of our own selves, is
the bread which we have to eat with all the meats, however
delicate they may be, in the way of prayer; without this bread,
life cannot be sustained, though it must be taken by measure.
When a soul beholds itself resigned, and clearly understands that
there is no goodness in it--when it feels itself abashed in the
presence of so great a King, and sees how little it pays of the
great debt it owes Him--why should it be necessary for it to
waste its time on this subject?  Why should it not rather proceed
to other matters which our Lord places before it, and for
neglecting which there is no reason?  His Majesty surely knows
better than we do what kind of food is proper for us.

24. So, then, it is of great consequence that the director should
be prudent--I mean, of sound understanding--and a man of
experience.  If, in addition to this, he is a learned man, it is
a very great matter.  But if these three qualities cannot be had
together, the first two are the most important, because learned
men may be found with whom we can communicate when it is
necessary.  I mean, that for beginners learned men are of little
use, if they are not men of prayer.  I do not say that they are
to have nothing to do with learned men, because a spirituality,
the foundations of which are not resting on the truth, I would
rather were not accompanied with prayer.  Learning is a great
thing, for it teaches us who know so little, and enlightens us;
so when we have come to the knowledge of the truths contained in
the holy writings, we do what we ought to do.  From silly
devotions, God deliver us!

25. I will explain myself further, for I am meddling, I believe,
with too many matters.  It has always been my failing that I
could never make myself understood--as I said before [11]--but at
the cost of many words.  A nun begins to practise prayer; if her
director be silly, and if he should take it into his head, he
will make her feel that it is better for her to obey him than her
own superior.  He will do all this without any evil purpose,
thinking that he is doing right.  For if he be not a religious
himself, he will think this right enough.  If his penitent be a
married woman, he will tell her that it is better for her to give
herself unto prayer, when she ought to attend to her house,
although she may thereby displease her husband.  And so it is, he
knows not how to make arrangements for time and business, so that
everything may be done as it ought to be done; he has no light
himself, and can therefore give none to others, however much he
may wish to do so.

26. Though learning does not seem necessary for discretion, my
opinion has always been, and will be, that every Christian should
continue to be guided by a learned director if he can, and the
more learned the better.  They who walk in the way of prayer have
the greater need of learning; and the more spiritual they are the
greater is that need.  Let them not say that learned men not
given to prayer are not fit counsellors for those who pray: that
is a delusion.  I have conversed with many; and now for some
years I have sought them the more, because of my greater need of
them.  I have always been fond of them; for though some of them
have no experience, they do not dislike spirituality, neither are
they ignorant of what it is, because in the sacred writings with
which they are familiar they always find the truth about
spirituality.  I am certain myself that a person given to prayer,
who treats of these matters with learned men, unless he is
deceived with his own consent, will never be carried away by any
illusions of the devil.  I believe that the evil spirits are
exceedingly afraid of learned men who are humble and virtuous,
knowing that they will be found out and defeated by them.

27. I have said this because there are opinions held to the
effect that learned men, if they are not spiritual, are not
suited for persons given to prayer.  I have just said that a
spiritual director is necessary; but if he be not a learned man,
he is a great hindrance.  It will help us much if we consult
those who are learned, provided they be virtuous; even if they be
not spiritual, they will be of service to me, and God will enable
them to understand what they should teach; He will even make them
spiritual, in order that they may help us on.  I do not say this
without having had experience of it; and I have met with more
than two.

28. I say, then, that a person who shall resign his soul to be
wholly subject to one director will make a great mistake, if he
is in religion, unless he finds a director of this kind, because
of the obedience due to his own superior.  His director may be
deficient in the three requisites I speak of, [12] and that will
be no slight cross, without voluntarily subjecting the
understanding to one whose understanding is none of the best.
At least, I have never been able to bring myself to do it,
neither does it seem to me to be right.

29. But if he be a person living in the world, let him praise God
for the power he has of choosing whom he will obey, and let him
not lose so excellent a liberty; yea, rather let him be without a
director till he finds him--for our Lord will give him one, if he
is really humble, and has a desire to meet with the right person.
I praise God greatly--we women, and those who are unlearned,
ought always to render Him unceasing thanks--because there are
persons who, by labours so great, have attained to the truth, of
which we unlearned people are ignorant. I often wonder at learned
men--particularly those who are in religion--when I think of the
trouble they have had in acquiring that which they communicate to
me for my good, and that without any more trouble to me than the
asking for it.  And yet there are people who will not take
advantage of their learning: God grant it may not be so!

30. I see them undergo the poverty of the religious life, which
is great, together with its penances, its meagre food, the yoke
of obedience, which makes me ashamed of myself at times; and with
all this, interrupted sleep, trials everywhere, everywhere the
Cross.  I think it would be a great evil for any one to lose so
great a good by his own fault.  It may be some of us, who are
exempted from these burdens--who have our food put into our
mouths, as they say, and live at our ease--may think, because we
give ourselves a little more to prayer, that we are raised above
the necessity of such great hardships.  Blessed be Thou, O Lord,
who hast made me so incapable and so useless; but I bless Thee
still more for this--that Thou quickenest so many to quicken us.
Our prayer must therefore be very earnest for those who give us
light.  What should we be without them in the midst of these
violent storms which now disturb the Church?  If some have
fallen, the good will shine more and more. [13]  May it please
our Lord to hold them in His hand, and help them, that they may
help us.

31. I have gone far away from the subject I began to speak of;
but all is to the purpose for those who are beginners, that they
may begin a journey which is so high in such a way as that they
shall go on by the right road.  Coming back, then, to what I
spoke of before, [14] the meditation on Christ bound to the
pillar, it is well we should make reflections for a time, and
consider the sufferings He there endured, for whom He endured
them, who He is who endured them, and the love with which He bore
them.  But a person should not always fatigue himself in making
these reflections, but rather let him remain there with Christ,
in the silence of the understanding.

32. If he is able, let him employ himself in looking upon Christ,
who is looking upon him; let him accompany Him, and make his
petitions to Him; let him humble himself, and delight himself in
Christ, and keep in mind that he never deserved to be there.
When he shall be able to do this, though it may be in the
beginning of his prayer, he will find great advantage; and this
way of prayer brings great advantages with it--at least, so my
soul has found it.  I do not know whether I am describing it
aright; you, my father, will see to it.  May our Lord grant me to
please Him rightly for ever!  Amen.

Chapter XIV.


The Second State of Prayer.  Its Supernatural Character.


1. Having spoken of the toilsome efforts and of the strength
required for watering the garden when we have to draw the water
out of the well, let us now speak of the second manner of drawing
the water, which the Lord of the vineyard has ordained; of the
machine of wheel and buckets whereby the gardener may draw more
water with less labour, and be able to take some rest without
being continually at work.  This, then, is what I am now going to
describe; and I apply it to the prayer called the prayer
of quiet.

2. Herein the soul begins to be recollected; it is now touching
on the supernatural--for it never could by any efforts of its own
attain to this.  True, it seems at times to have been wearied at
the wheel, labouring with the understanding, and filling the
buckets; but in this second degree the water is higher, and
accordingly the labour is much less than it was when the water
had to be drawn up out of the well; I mean, that the water is
nearer to it, for grace reveals itself more distinctly to
the soul.

3. This is a gathering together of the faculties of the soul
within itself, in order that it may have the fruition of that
contentment in greater sweetness; but the faculties are not lost,
neither are they asleep: the will alone is occupied in such a way
that, without knowing how it has become a captive, it gives a
simple consent to become the prisoner of God; for it knows well
what is to be the captive of Him it loves.  O my Jesus and my
Lord, how pressing now is Thy love! [1]  It binds our love in
bonds so straitly, that it is not in its power at this moment to
love anything else but Thee.

4. The other two faculties help the will, that it may render
itself capable of the fruition of so great a good; nevertheless,
it occasionally happens, even when the will is in union, that
they hinder it very much: but then it should never heed them at
all, simply abiding in its fruition and quiet. [2]  For if it
tried to make them recollected, it would miss its way together
with them, because they are at this time like doves which are not
satisfied with the food the master of the dovecot gives them
without any labouring for it on their part, and which go forth in
quest of it elsewhere, and so hardly find it that they come back.
And so the memory and the understanding come and go, seeking
whether the will is going to give them that into the fruition of
which it has entered itself.

5. If it be our Lord's pleasure to throw them any food, they
stop; if not, they go again to seek it.  They must be thinking
that they are of some service to the will; and now and then the
memory or the imagination, seeking to represent to it that of
which it has the fruition, does it harm.  The will, therefore,
should be careful to deal with them as I shall explain.
Everything that takes place now in this state brings the very
greatest consolation; and the labour is so slight, that prayer,
even if persevered in for some time, is never wearisome.
The reason is, that the understanding is now working very gently,
and is drawing very much more water than it drew out of the well.
The tears, which God now sends, flow with joy; though we feel
them, they are not the result of any efforts of our own.

6. This water of grand blessings and graces, which our Lord now
supplies, makes the virtues thrive much more, beyond all
comparison, than they did in the previous state of prayer; for
the soul is already ascending out of its wretched state, and some
little knowledge of the blissfulness of glory is communicated to
it.  This, I believe, is it that makes the virtues grow the more,
and also to draw nearer to essential virtue, God Himself, from
Whom all virtues proceed; for His Majesty has begun to
communicate Himself to this soul, and will have it feel how He is
communicating Himself.

7. As soon as the soul has arrived thus far, it begins to lose
the desire of earthly things, [3] and no wonder; for it sees
clearly that, even for a moment, this joy is not to be had on
earth; that there are no riches, no dominion, no honours, no
delights, that can for one instant, even for the twinkling of an
eye, minister such a joy; for it is a true satisfaction, and the
soul sees that it really does satisfy.  Now, we who are on earth,
as it seems to me, scarcely ever understand wherein our
satisfaction lies, for it is always liable to disappointment; but
in this, at that time, there is none: the disappointment cometh
afterwards, when the soul sees that all is over, and that it has
no power to recover it, neither does it know how; for if it cut
itself in pieces by penance and prayer, and every other kind of
austerities, all would be of little use, if our Lord did not
grant it.  God, in His great mercy, will have the soul comprehend
that His Majesty is so near to it, that it need not send
messengers to Him, but may speak to Him itself, and not with a
loud crying, because so near is He already, that He understands
even the movements of its lips.

8. It seems absurd to say this, seeing that we know that God
understands us always, and is present with us.  It is so, and
there can be no doubt of it; but our Emperor and Lord will have
us now understand that He understands us; and also have us
understand what His presence bringeth about, and that He means in
a special way to begin a work in the soul, which is manifested in
the great joy, inward and outward, which He communicates, and in
the difference there is, as I said just now, between this joy and
delight and all the joys of earth; for He seems to be filling up
the void in our souls occasioned by our sins.

9. This satisfaction lies in the innermost part of the soul, and
the soul knows not whence, nor how, it came, very often it knows
not what to do, or wish, or pray for.  It seems to find all this
at once, and knoweth not what it hath found; nor do I know how to
explain it, because learning is necessary for many things.  Here,
indeed, learning would be very much to the purpose, in order to
explain the general and particular helps of grace; for there are
many who know nothing about them.  Learning would serve to show
how our Lord now will have the soul to see, as it were, with the
naked eye, as men speak, this particular help of grace, and be
also useful in many other ways wherein I am likely to go astray.
But as what I write is to be seen by those who have the learning
to discover whether I make mistakes or not, I go on without
anxiety; for I know I need have none whatever about either the
letter or the spirit, because it is in their power to whom it is
to be sent to do with it as they will: they will understand it,
and blot out whatever may be amiss.

10. I should like them to explain this, because it is a principal
point, and because a soul, when our Lord begins to bestow these
graces upon it, does not understand them, and does not know what
to do with itself; for if God leads it by the way of fear, as He
led me, its trial will be heavy, if there be no one who
understands the state it is in; and to see itself as in a picture
is a great comfort; and then it sees clearly that it is
travelling on that road.  The knowledge of what it has to do is a
great blessing for it, so that it may advance forwards in every
one of these degrees of prayer; for I have suffered greatly, and
lost much time, because I did not know what to do; and I am very
sorry for those souls who find themselves alone when they come to
this state; for though I read many spiritual books, wherein this
very matter is discussed, they threw very little light upon it.
And if it be not a soul much exercised in prayer, it will find it
enough to understand its state, be the books ever so clear.

11. I wish much that our Lord would help me to describe the
effects on the soul of these things, now that they begin to be
supernatural, so that men might know by these effects whether
they come from the Spirit of God.  I mean, known as things are
known here below--though it is always well to live in fear, and
on our guard; for even if they do come from God, now and then the
devil will be able to transform himself into an angel of
light; [4] and the soul, if not experienced herein, will not
understand the matter; and it must have so much experience for
the understanding thereof, that it is necessary it should have
attained to the highest perfection of prayer.

12. The little time I have helps me but little, and it is
therefore necessary His Majesty should undertake it Himself; for
I have to live in community, and have very many things to employ
me, as I am in a house which is newly founded--as will appear
hereafter; [5] and so I am writing, with very many interruptions,
by little and little at a time.  I wish I had leisure; for when
our Lord gives the spirit, it is more easily and better done; it
is then as with a person working embroidery with the pattern
before her; but if the spirit be wanting, there is no more
meaning in the words than in gibberish, so to speak, though many
years may have been spent in prayer.  And thus I think it a very
great advantage to be in this state of prayer when I am writing
this; for I see clearly that it is not I who speak, nor is it I
who with her understanding has arranged it; and afterwards I do
not know how I came to speak so accurately. [6]  It has often
happened to me thus.

13. Let us now return to our orchard, or flower-garden, and
behold now how the trees begin to fill with sap for the bringing
forth of the blossoms, and then of the fruit--the flowers and the
plants, also, their fragrance.  This illustration pleases me; for
very often, when I was beginning--and our Lord grant that I have
really begun to serve His Majesty--I mean, begun in relation to
what I have to say of my life,--it was to me a great joy to
consider my soul as a garden, and our Lord as walking in it.
I used to beseech Him to increase the fragrance of the little
flowers of virtues--which were beginning, as it seemed to
bud--and preserve them, that they might be to His glory; for I
desired nothing for myself.  I prayed Him to cut those He liked,
because I already knew that they would grow the better.

14. I say cut; for there are times in which the soul has no
recollection of this garden--everything seems parched, and there
is no water to be had for preserving it--and in which it seems as
if the soul had never possessed any virtue at all.  This is the
season of heavy trials; for our Lord will have the poor gardener
suppose all the trouble he took in maintaining and watering the
garden to have been taken to no purpose.  Then is the time really
for weeding and rooting out every plant, however small it may be,
that is worthless, in the knowledge that no efforts of ours are
sufficient, if God withholds from us the waters of His grace; and
in despising ourselves as being nothing, and even less than
nothing.  In this way we gain great humility--the flowers
grow afresh.

15. O my Lord and my Good!  I cannot utter these words without
tears, and rejoicing in my soul; for Thou wilt be thus with us,
and art with us, in the Sacrament.  We may believe so most truly;
for so it is, and the comparison I make is a great truth; and, if
our sins stand not in the way, we may rejoice in Thee, because
Thou rejoicest in us; for Thou hast told us that Thy delight is
to be with the children of men. [7]  O my Lord, what does it
mean?  Whenever I hear these words, they always give me great
consolation, and did so even when I was most wicked.

16. Is it possible, 0 Lord, that there can be a soul which, after
attaining to this state wherein Thou bestowest upon it the like
graces and consolations, and wherein it understands that Thou
delightest to be with it, can yet fall back and offend Thee after
so many favours, and such great demonstrations of the love Thou
bearest it, and of which there cannot be any doubt, because the
effect of it is so visible?  Such a soul there certainly is; for
I have done so, not once, but often.  May it please Thy goodness,
O Lord, that I may be alone in my ingratitude--the only one who
has committed so great an iniquity, and whose ingratitude has
been so immeasurable!  But even out of my ingratitude Thine
infinite goodness has brought forth some good; and the greater my
wickedness, the greater the splendour of the great mercy of Thy
compassions.  Oh, what reasons have I to magnify them for ever!

17. May it be so, I beseech Thee, O my God, and may I sing of
them for ever, now that Thou hast been pleased to show mercies so
great unto me that they who see them are astonished, mercies
which draw me out of myself continually, that I may praise Thee
more and more! for, remaining in myself, without Thee, I could do
nothing, O my Lord, but be as the withered flowers of the garden;
so that this miserable earth of mine becomes a heap of refuse, as
it was before.  Let it not be so, O Lord!--let not a soul which
Thou hast purchased with so many labours be lost, one which Thou
hast so often ransomed anew, and delivered from between the teeth
of the hideous dragon!

18. You, my father, must forgive me for wandering from the
subject; and, as I am speaking to the purpose I have in view, you
must not be surprised.  What I write is what my soul has
understood; and it is very often hard enough to abstain from the
praises of God when, in the course of writing, the great debt I
owe Him presents itself before me.  Nor do I think that it can be
disagreeable to you; because both of us, I believe, may sing the
same song, though in a different way; for my debt is much the
greater, seeing that God has forgiven me more, as you, my
father, know.

hardly say of it, now that she was at least in her forty-seventh
year, that it was newly founded.  The house, however, was poor;

they throw great light on the text: "Sunt et alli testes de visu

Mother Anne of the Incarnation says she saw the Saint one night,

Chapter XV.


Instructions for Those Who Have Attained to the Prayer of Quiet.
Many Advance So Far, but Few Go Farther.


1. Let us now go back to the subject.  This quiet and
recollection of the soul makes itself in great measure felt in
the satisfaction and peace, attended with very great joy and
repose of the faculties, and most sweet delight, wherein the soul
is established. [1]  It thinks, because it has not gone beyond
it, that there is nothing further to wish for, but that its abode
might be there, and it would willingly say so with St. Peter. [2]
It dares not move nor stir, because it thinks that this blessing
it has received must then escape out of its hands; now and then,
it could wish it did not even breathe. [3]  The poor little soul
is not aware that, as of itself it could do nothing to draw down
this blessing on itself, it is still less able to retain it a
moment longer than our Lord wills it should remain.

2. I have already said that, in the prior recollection and
quiet, [4] there is no failure of the powers of the soul; but the
soul is so satisfied in God that, although two of its powers be
distracted, yet, while the recollection lasts, as the will abides
in union with God, so its peace and quiet are not disturbed; on
the contrary, the will by degrees brings the understanding and
the memory back again; for though the will is not yet altogether
absorbed, it continues still occupied without knowing how, so
that, notwithstanding all the efforts of the memory and the
understanding, they cannot rob it of its delight and
joy [5]--yea, rather, it helps without any labour at all to keep
this little spark of the love of God from being quenched.

3. Oh, that His Majesty would be gracious unto me, and enable me
to give a clear account of the matter; for many are the souls who
attain to this state, and few are they who go farther: and I know
not who is in fault; most certainly it is not God; for when His
Majesty shows mercy unto a soul, so that it advances so far, I
believe that He will not fail to be more merciful still, if there
be no shortcomings on our part.

4. And it is of great importance for the soul that has advanced
so far as this to understand the great dignity of its state, the
great grace given it by our Lord, and how in all reason it should
not belong to earth; because He, of His goodness, seems to make
it here a denizen of heaven, unless it be itself in fault.
And miserable will that soul be if it turns back; it will go
down, I think so, even to the abyss, as I was going myself, if
the mercy of our Lord had not brought me back; because, for the
most part, it must be the effect of grave faults--that is my
opinion: nor is it possible to forsake so great a good otherwise
than through the blindness occasioned by much evil.

5. Therefore, for the love of our Lord, I implore those souls to
whom His Majesty has given so great a grace--the attainment of
this state--to know and make much of themselves, with a humble
and holy presumption, in order that they may never return to the
flesh-pots of Egypt.  And if through weakness and wickedness, and
a mean and wretched nature, they should fall, as I did, let them
always keep in mind the good they have lost; let them suspect and
fear--they have reason to do so--that, if they do not resume
their prayer, they may go on from bad to worse.  I call that a
real fall which makes us hate the way by which so great a good
was obtained.  I address myself to those souls; but I am not
saying that they will never offend God, nor fall into
sin,--though there are good reasons why those who have received
these graces should keep themselves carefully from sin; but we
are miserable creatures.  What I earnestly advise is this: let
there be no giving up of prayer; it is by prayer they will
understand what they are doing, and obtain from our Lord the
grace to repent, and strength to rise again; they must believe
and believe again that, if they cease from praying, they run--so
I think--into danger.  I know not if I understand what I am
saying; for, as I said before, I measure others by myself. [6]

6. The prayer of quiet, then, is a little spark of the true love
of Himself, which our Lord begins to enkindle in the soul; and
His will is, that the soul should understand what this love is by
the joy it brings.  This quiet and recollection and little spark,
if it is the work of the Spirit of God, and not a sweetness
supplied by Satan, or brought about by ourselves, produces great
results.  A person of experience, however, cannot possibly fail
to understand at once that it is not a thing that can be
acquired, were it not that our nature is so greedy of sweetness,
that it seeks for it in every way.  But it becomes cold very
soon; for, however much we try to make the fire burn, in order to
obtain this sweetness, it does not appear that we do anything
else but throw water on it, to put it out.  This spark, then,
given of God, however slight it may be, causes a great crackling;
and if men do not quench it by their faults, it is the beginning
of the great fire, which sends forth--I shall speak of it in the
proper place [7]--the flames of that most vehement love of God
which His Majesty will have perfect souls to possess.

7. This little spark is a sign or pledge which God gives to a
soul, in token of His having chosen it for great things, if it
will prepare to receive them.  It is a great gift, much too great
for me to be able to speak of it.  It is a great sorrow to me;
because, as I said before, [8] I know that many souls come thus
far, and that those who go farther, as they ought to go, are so
few, that I am ashamed to say it.  I do not mean that they are
absolutely few: there must be many, because God is patient with
us, for some reasons; I speak of what I have seen.

8. I should like much to recommend these souls to take care that
they do not hide their talent; for it may be that God has chosen
them to be the edification of many others, especially in these
days, when the friends of God should be strong, in order that
they may support the weak.  Those who discern in themselves this
grace, must look upon themselves as such friends, if they would
fulfil the law which even the honourable friendship of the world
respects; if not, as I said just now, [9] let them fear and
tremble, lest they should be doing mischief to themselves--and
God grant it be to themselves only!

9. What the soul has to do at those seasons wherein it is raised
to the prayer of quiet is nothing more than to be gentle and
without noise.  By noise, I mean going about with the
understanding in search of words and reflections whereby to give
God thanks for this grace, and heaping up its sins and
imperfections together to show that it does not deserve it.
All this commotion takes place now, and the understanding comes
forward, and the memory is restless, and certainly to me these
powers bring much weariness at times; for, though my memory is
not strong, I cannot control it.  Let the will quietly and wisely
understand that it is not by dint of labour on our part that we
can converse to any good purpose with God, and that our own
efforts are only great logs of wood, laid on without discretion
to quench this little spark; and let it confess this, and in
humility say, O Lord, what can I do here? what has the servant to
do with her Lord, and earth with heaven? or words of love that
suggest themselves now, firmly grounded in the conviction that
what it says is truth; and let it make no account of the
understanding, which is simply tiresome.

10. And if the will wishes to communicate to the understanding
any portion of that the fruition of which itself has entered on,
or if it labours to make the understanding recollected, it shall
not succeed; for it will often happen that the will is in union
and at rest, while the understanding is in extreme disorder.
It is better for it to leave it alone, and not to run after it--I
am speaking of the will; for the will should abide in the
fruition of that grace, recollected itself, like the prudent bee;
for if no bees entered the hive, and each of them wandered abroad
in search of the rest, the honey would hardly be made.  In the
same way, the soul will lose much if it be not careful now,
especially if the understanding be acute; for when it begins to
make reflections and search for reasons, it will think at once
that it is doing something if its reasons and reflections
are good.

11. The only reason that ought to be admitted now is to
understand clearly that there is no reason whatever, except His
mere goodness, why God should grant us so great a grace, and to
be aware that we are so near Him, and to pray to His Majesty for
mercies, to make intercession for the Church, for those who had
been recommended to us, and for the souls in purgatory,--not,
however, with noise of words, but with a heartfelt desire to be
heard.  This is a prayer that contains much, and by it more is
obtained than by many reflections of the understanding.  Let the
will stir up some of those reasons, which proceed from reason
itself, to quicken its love, such as the fact of its being in a
better state, and let it make certain acts of love, as what it
will do for Him to whom it owes so much,--and that, as I said
just now, without any noise of the understanding, in the search
after profound reflections.  A little straw,--and it will be less
than straw, if we bring it ourselves,--laid on with humility,
will be more effectual here, and will help to kindle a fire more
than many fagots of most learned reasons, which, in my opinion,
will put it out in a moment.

12. This is good for those learned men who have commanded me to
write, [10] and who all, by the goodness of God, have come to
this state; for it may be that they spend the time in making
applications of passages of the Scriptures.  And though learning
could not fail to be of great use to them, both before and after
prayer, still, in the very time of prayer itself, there is little
necessity for it, in my opinion, unless it be for the purpose of
making the will tepid; for the understanding then, because of its
nearness to the light, is itself illuminated; so that even I, who
am what I am, seem to be a different person.  And so it is; for
it has happened to me, who scarcely understand a word of what I
read in Latin, and specially in the Psalms, when in the prayer of
quiet, not only to understand the Latin as if it were Spanish,
but, still more, to take a delight in dwelling on the meaning of
that I knew through the Spanish.  We must make an exception: if
these learned men have to preach or to teach, they will do well
to take advantage of their learning, that they may help poor
people of little learning, of whom I am one.  Charity is a great
thing; and so always is ministering unto souls, when done simply
for God.

13. So, then, when the soul is in the prayer of quiet, let it
repose in its rest--let learning be put on one side.  The time
will come when they may make use of it in the service of our
Lord--when they that possess it will appreciate it so highly as
to be glad that they had not neglected it even for all the
treasures of the world, simply because it enables them to serve
His Majesty; for it is a great help.  But in the eyes of Infinite
Wisdom, believe me, a little striving after humility, and a
single act thereof, are worth more than all the science in the
world.  This is not the time for discussing, but for
understanding plainly what we are, and presenting ourselves in
simplicity before God, who will have the soul make itself as a
fool--as, indeed, it is--in His presence, seeing that His Majesty
so humbles Himself as to suffer it to be near Him, we being what
we are.

14. Moreover, the understanding bestirs itself to make its
thanksgiving in phrases well arranged; but the will, in peace,
not daring to lift up its eyes with the publican, [11] makes
perhaps a better act of thanksgiving than the understanding, with
all the tropes of its rhetoric.  In a word, mental prayer is not
to be abandoned altogether now, nor even vocal prayer, if at any
time we wish, or can, to make use of either of them; for if the
state of quiet be profound, it becomes difficult to speak, and it
can be done only with great pain.

15. I believe myself that we know whether this proceeds from the
Spirit of God, or is brought about by endeavours of our own, in
the commencement of devotion which God gives; and we seek of
ourselves, as I said before, [12] to pass onwards to this quiet
of the will.  Then, no effect whatever is produced; it is quickly
over, and aridity is the result.  If it comes from Satan, the
practised soul, in my opinion, will detect it, because it leaves
trouble behind, and scant humility and poor dispositions for
those effects which are wrought if it comes from God; it leaves
neither light in the understanding nor steadiness in
the truth. [13]

16. Here Satan can do little or no harm, if the soul directs unto
God the joy and sweetness it then feels; and if it fixes the
thoughts and desires on Him, according to the advice already
given, the devil can gain nothing whatever--on the contrary, by
the permission of God, he will lose much by that very joy which
he causes in the soul, because that joy will help the soul,
inasmuch as it thinks the joy comes from God, to betake itself
often to prayer in its desire for it.  And if the soul is humble,
indifferent to, and detached from, all joy, however spiritual,
and if it loves the cross, it will make no account of the
sweetness which Satan sends.  But it cannot so deal with that
which comes from the Spirit of God; of that it will make much.
Now, when Satan sends it, as he is nothing but a lie, and when he
sees that the soul humbles itself through that joy and
sweetness--and here, in all things relating to prayer and
sweetness, we must be very careful to endeavour to make ourselves
humble,--Satan will not often repeat his work, when he sees that
he loses by it.

17. For this and for many other reasons, when I was speaking of
the first degree of prayer, and of the first method of drawing
the water, [14] I insisted upon it that the great affair of souls
is, when they begin to pray, to begin also to detach themselves
from every kind of joy, and to enter on it resolved only on
helping to carry the cross of Christ like good soldiers, willing
to serve their King without present pay, because they are sure of
it at last, having their eyes directed to the true and
everlasting kingdom at the conquest of which we are aiming.

18. It is a very great matter to have this always before our
eyes, especially in the beginning; afterwards, it becomes so
clear, that it is rather a matter of necessity to forget it, in
order to live on.  Now, labouring to keep in mind that all things
here below are of short duration, that they are all nothing, that
the rest we have here is to be accounted as none,--all this, I
say, seems to be exceedingly low; and so, indeed, it is,--because
those who have gone on to greater perfection would look upon it
as a reproach, and be ashamed of themselves, if they thought that
they were giving up the goods of this world because they are
perishable, or that they would not be glad to give them up for
God--even if they were to last for ever.  The greater the
perfection of these persons, the greater their joy, and the
greater also would that joy be if the duration of these worldly
goods were greater.

19. In these persons, thus far advanced, love is already grown,
and love is that which does this work.  But as to beginners, to
them it is of the utmost importance, and they must not regard
this consideration as unbecoming, for the blessings to be gained
are great,--and that is why I recommend it so much to them; for
they will have need of it--even those who have attained to great
heights of prayer--at certain times, when God will try them, and
when His Majesty seems to have forsaken them.

20. I have said as much already, and I would not have it
forgotten, [15] in this our life on earth, the growth of the soul
is not like that of the body.  We, however, so speak of it--and,
in truth, it does grow.  A youth that is grown up, whose body is
formed, and who is become a man, does not ungrow, nor does his
body lessen in size; but as to the soul, it so is by our Lord's
will, so far as I have seen it in my own experience,--but I know
nothing of it in any other way.  It must be in order to humble us
for our greater good, and to keep us from being careless during
our exile; seeing that he who has ascended the higher has the
more reason to be afraid, and to be less confident in himself.
A time may come when they whose will is so wrapt up in the will
of God--and who, rather than fall into a single imperfection,
would undergo torture and suffer a thousand deaths--will find it
necessary, if they would be delivered from offending God, and
from the commission of sin, to make use of the first armour of
prayer, to call to mind how everything is coming to an end, that
there is a heaven and a hell, and to make use of other
reflections of that nature, when they find themselves assailed by
temptations and persecutions.

21. Let us go back to what I was saying.  The great source of our
deliverance from the cunning devices and the sweetness which
Satan sends is to begin with a resolution to walk in the way of
the Cross from the very first, and not to desire any sweetness at
all, seeing that our Lord Himself has pointed out to us the way
of perfection, saying, "Take up thy cross and follow Me." [16]
He is our example; and whosoever follows His counsels only to
please Him has nothing to fear.  In the improvement which they
detect in themselves, they who do so will see that this is no
work of Satan and if they fall, they have a sign of the presence
of our Lord in their rising again at once.  They have other
signs, also, of which I am going to speak.

22. When it is the work of the Spirit of God, there is no
necessity for going about searching for reasons, on the strength
of which we may elicit acts of humility and of shame, because our
Lord Himself supplies them in a way very different from that by
which we could acquire them by our own poor reflections, which
are as nothing in comparison with that real humility arising out
of the light which our Lord here gives us, and which begets a
confusion of face that undoes us.  The knowledge with which God
supplies us, in order that we may know that of ourselves we have
no good in us, is perfectly apprehended--and the more perfectly,
the greater the graces.  It fills us with a great desire of
advancing in prayer, and of never giving it up, whatever troubles
may arise.  The soul offers to suffer everything.  A certain
security, joined with humility and fear concerning our salvation,
casts out servile fear at once from the soul, and in its place
plants a loyal fear [17] of more perfect growth. [18]  There is a
visible beginning of a love of God, utterly divested of all
self-interest, together with a longing after seasons of solitude,
in order to obtain a greater fruition of this good.

23. In short, not to weary myself, it is the beginning of all
good; the flowers have so thriven, that they are on the point of
budding.  And this the soul sees most clearly, and it is
impossible to persuade it now that God was not with it, till it
turns back upon itself, and beholds its own failings and
imperfections.  Then it fears for everything; and it is well it
should do so--though there are souls whom the certain conviction
that God is with them benefits more than all the fear they may
ever have.  If a soul love greatly, and is thankful naturally,
the remembrance of the mercies of God makes it turn to Him more
effectually than all the chastisements of hell it can ever
picture to itself--at least, it was so with me, though I am
so wicked.

24. As I shall speak at greater length of the signs of a good
spirit [19]--it has cost me much labour to be clear about them--I
do not treat of them here.  I believe, too, that, with the help
of God, I shall be able to speak somewhat to the point,
because--setting aside the experience I have had, and by which I
learned much--I have had the help of some most learned men and
persons of great holiness, whom we may reasonably believe in the
matter. Souls, therefore, are not to weary themselves so much as
I did, when, by the goodness of our Lord, they may have come to
this state.

Chapter XVI.


The Third State of Prayer.  Deep Matters.  What the Soul Can Do
That Has Reached It.  Effects of the Great Graces of Our Lord.


1. Let us now speak of the third water wherewith this garden is
watered,--water running from a river or from a brook,--whereby
the garden is watered with very much less trouble, although there
is some in directing the water. [1]  In this state our Lord will
help the gardener, and in such a way as to be, as it were, the
Gardener Himself, doing all the work.  It is a sleep of the
powers of the soul, which are not wholly lost, nor yet
understanding how they are at work.  The pleasure, sweetness, and
delight are incomparably greater than in the former state of
prayer; and the reason is, that the waters of grace have risen up
to the neck of the soul, so that it can neither advance nor
retreat--nor does it know how to do so; it seeks only the
fruition of exceeding bliss.  It is like a dying man with the
candle in his hand, on the point of dying the death desired.
It is rejoicing in this agony with unutterable joy; to me it
seems to be nothing else but a death, as it were, to all the
things of this world, and a fruition of God.  I know of no other
words whereby to describe it or to explain it; neither does the
soul then know what to do,--for it knows not whether to speak or
be silent, whether it should laugh or weep.  It is a glorious
folly, a heavenly madness, wherein true wisdom is acquired; and
to the soul a kind of fruition most full of delight. [2]

2. It is now some five or six years, I believe, since our Lord
raised me to this state of prayer, in its fulness, and that more
than once,--and I never understood it, and never could explain
it; and so I was resolved, when I should come thus far in my
story, to say very little or nothing at all.  I knew well enough
that it was not altogether the union of all the faculties, and
yet most certainly it was higher than the previous state of
prayer; but I confess that I could not determine and understand
the difference.

3. The humility of your reverence, willing to be helped by a
simplicity so great as mine, has been the cause, I believe, why
our Lord, to-day, after Communion, admitted me to this state of
prayer, without the power of going further, and suggested to me
these comparisons, and taught me how to speak of it, and of what
the soul must do therein.  Certainly, I was amazed, and in a
moment understood it all.  I have often been thus, as it were,
beside myself, drunk with love, and yet never could understand
how it was.  I knew well that it was the work of God, but I never
was able to understand the manner of His working here; for, in
fact, the faculties are almost all completely in union, yet not
so absorbed that they do not act.  I have been singularly
delighted in that I have been able to comprehend the matter at
last.  Blessed be our Lord, who has thus consoled me!

4. The faculties of the soul now retain only the power of
occupying themselves wholly with God; not one of them ventures to
stir, neither can we move one of them without making great
efforts to distract ourselves--and, indeed, I do not think we can
do it at all at this time.  Many words are then uttered in praise
of God--but disorderly, unless it be that our Lord orders them
himself.  At least, the understanding is utterly powerless here;
the soul longs to send forth words of praise, but it has no
control over itself,--it is in a state of sweet restlessness.
The flowers are already opening; they are beginning to send forth
their fragrance.

5. The soul in this state would have all men behold and know of
its bliss, to the praise of God, and help it to praise Him.
It would have them to be partakers of its joy; for its joy is
greater than it can bear.  It seems to me that it is like the
woman in the Gospel, who would, or used to, call in her
neighbours. [3]  The admirable spirit of David, the royal
prophet, must have felt in the same way, so it seems to me, when
he played on the harp, singing the praises of God.  I have a very
great devotion to this glorious king; [4] and I wish all had it,
particularly those who are sinners like myself.

6. O my God, what must that soul be when it is in this state?
It wishes it were all tongue, in order that it may praise our
Lord. It utters a thousand holy follies, striving continually to
please Him by whom it is thus possessed.  I know one [5] who,
though she was no poet, yet composed, without any preparation,
certain stanzas, full of feeling, most expressive of her pain:
they were not the work of her own understanding; but, in order to
have a greater fruition of that bliss which so sweet a pain
occasioned her, she complained of it in that way to God. She was
willing to be cut in pieces, soul and body, to show the delight
she felt in that pain.  To what torments could she be then
exposed, that would not be delicious to endure for her Lord?
She sees clearly that the martyrs did little or nothing, so far
as they were concerned, when they endured their tortures, because
the soul is well aware that its strength is derived from
another source.

7. But what will be its sufferings when it returns to the use of
the senses, to live in the world, and go back to the anxieties
and the fashions thereof?  I do not think that I have exaggerated
in any way, but rather have fallen short, in speaking of that
joy, which our Lord, of His good pleasure, gives to the soul in
this its exile.  Blessed for ever be Thou, O Lord! and may all
created things praise Thee for ever!

8. O my King, seeing that I am now, while writing this, still
under the power of this heavenly madness, an effect of Thy mercy
and goodness,--and it is a mercy I never deserved,--grant, I
beseech Thee, that all those with whom I may have to converse may
become mad through Thy love, or let me converse with none, or so
order it that I may have nothing to do in the world, or take me
away from it.  This Thy servant, O my God, is no longer able to
endure sufferings so great as those are which she must bear when
she sees herself without Thee if she must live, she seeks no
repose in this life,--and do Thou give her none.  This my soul
longs to be free--eating is killing it, and sleep is wearisome;
it sees itself wasting the time of this life in comforts, and
that there is no comfort for it now but in Thee; it seems to be
living contrary to nature--for now, it desires to live not in
itself, but in Thee.

9. O my true Lord and my happiness! what a cross hast Thou
prepared for those who attain to this state!--light and most
heavy at the same time: light, because sweet; heavy, because now
and then there is no patience left to endure it--and yet the soul
never wishes to be delivered from it, unless it be that it may
come to Thee.  When the soul remembers that it has never served
Thee at all, and that by living on it may do Thee some service,
it longs for a still heavier cross, and never to die before the
end of the world.  Its own repose it counts as nothing in
comparison with doing a slight service to Thee.  It knows not
what to desire; but it clearly understands that it desires
nothing else but Thee.

10. O my son, [6] so humble is he to whom this writing is
directed, and who has commanded me to write, that he suffers
himself to be thus addressed,--you, my father, only must see
these things, in which I seem to have transgressed all bounds;
for no reason can keep me reasonable when our Lord draws me out
of myself.  Since my communion this morning, [7] I do not believe
that I am the person who is speaking; I seem to be dreaming the
things I see, and I wish I might never see any but people ill, as
I am now.  I beseech you, my father, let us all be mad, for the
love of Him who for our sakes suffered men to say of Him that He
was mad. [8]

11. You, my father, say that you wish me well.  I wish you would
prove it by disposing yourself so that God may bestow this grace
upon you; for I see very few people who have not too much sense
for everything they have to do: and it may be that I have more
than anybody else.  Your reverence must not allow it; you are my
father, for you are my confessor, and the person to whom I have
trusted my soul; disperse my delusions by telling the truth; for
truths of this sort are very rarely told.

12. I wish we five, who now love one another in our Lord, had
made some such arrangement as this: as others in these times have
met together in secret [9] to plot wickedness and heresies
against His Majesty, so we might contrive to meet together now
and then, in order to undeceive one another, to tell each other
wherein we might improve ourselves, and be more pleasing unto
God; for there is no one that knows himself as well as he is
known of others who see him, if it be with eyes of love and the
wish to do him good. I say; in secret; for language of this kind
is no longer in use; even preachers go about arranging their
sermons so as to displease no one. [10]  They have a good
intention, and their work is good; yet still few amend their
lives.  But how is it that they are not many who, in consequence
of these sermons, abstain from public sins?  Well, I think it is
because the preachers are highly sensible men.  They are not
burning with the great fire of the love of God, as the Apostles
were, casting worldly prudence aside; and so their fire throws
out but little heat.  I do not say that their fire ought to burn
like that of the Apostles, but I do wish it were a stronger fire
than I see it is.  Do you, my father, know wherein much of this
fire consists?  In the hatred of this life, in the desertion of
its honours, in being utterly indifferent whether we lose or gain
anything or everything, provided the truth be told and maintained
for the glory of God; for he who is courageously in earnest for
God, looks upon loss or gain indifferently.  I do not say that I
am a person of this kind, but I wish I was.

13. Oh, grand freedom, to regard it as a captivity to be obliged
to live and converse with men according to the laws of the world!
It is the gift of our Lord; there is not a slave who would not
imperil everything that he might escape and return to his
country; and as this is the true road, there is no reason why we
should linger; for we shall never effectually gain a treasure so
great, so long as this life is not ended.  May our Lord give us
His grace for that end!  You, my father, if it shall seem good to
you, will tear up what I have written, and consider it as a
letter for yourself alone, and forgive me that I have been
very bold.

Chapter XVII.


The Third State of Prayer.  The Effects Thereof.  The Hindrance
Caused by the Imagination and the Memory.


1. Enough has been said of this manner of prayer, and of what the
soul has to do, or rather, to speak more correctly, of what God
is doing within it; for it is He who now takes upon Himself the
gardener's work, and who will have the soul take its ease; except
that the will is consenting to the graces, the fruition of which
it has, and that it must resign itself to all that the True
Wisdom would accomplish in it--for which it is certain it has
need of courage; because the joy is so great, that the soul seems
now and then to be on the very point of going forth out of the
body: and what a blessed death that would be!  Now, I think it is
for the soul's good--as you, my father, have been told--to
abandon itself into the arms of God altogether; if He will take
it to heaven, let it go; if to hell, no matter, as it is going
thither with its sovereign Good.  If life is to come to an end
for ever, so it wills; if it is to last a thousand years, it
wills that also: His Majesty may do with it as with His own
property,--the soul no longer belongs to itself, it has been
given wholly to our Lord; let it cast all care utterly away.

2. My meaning is that, in a state of prayer, so high as this, the
soul understands that God is doing His work without any fatiguing
of the understanding, except that, as it seems to me, it is as if
amazed in beholding our Lord taking upon Himself the work of the
good gardener, refusing to let the soul undergo any labour
whatever, but that of taking its pleasure in the flowers
beginning to send forth their fragrance; for when God raises a
soul up to this state, it can do all this, and much more,--for
these are the effects of it.

3. In one of these visits, how brief soever it may be, the
Gardener, being who He is,--in a word, the Creator of the
water,--pours the water without stint; and what the poor soul,
with the labour, perhaps, of twenty years in fatiguing the
understanding, could not bring about, that the heavenly Gardener
accomplishes in an instant, causing the fruit both to grow and
ripen; so that the soul, such being the will of our Lord, may
derive its sustenance from its garden.  But He allows it not to
divide the fruit with others, until by eating thereof, it is
strong enough not to waste it in the mere tasting of it,--giving
to Him none of the produce, nor making any compensation for it to
Him who supplies it,--lest it should be maintaining others,
feeding them at its own cost, and itself perhaps dying of
hunger. [1]  The meaning of this is perfectly clear for those who
have understanding enough to apply it--much more clear than I can
make it; and I am tired.

4. Finally, the virtues are now stronger than they were during
the preceding prayer of quiet; for the soul sees itself to be
other than it was, and it knows not how it is beginning to do
great things in the odour which the flowers send forth; it being
our Lord's will that the flowers should open, in order that the
soul may believe itself to be in possession of virtue; though it
sees most clearly that it cannot, and never could, acquire them
in many years, and that the heavenly Gardener has given them to
it in that instant.  Now, too, the humility of the soul is much
greater and deeper than it was before; because it sees more
clearly that it did neither much nor little, beyond giving its
consent that our Lord might work those graces in it, and then
accepting them willingly.

5. This state of prayer seems to me to be a most distinct union
of the whole soul with God, but for this, that His Majesty
appears to give the faculties leave to be intent upon, and have
the fruition of, the great work He is doing then.  It happens at
times, and indeed very often, that, the will being in union, the
soul should be aware of it, and see that the will is a captive
and in joy, that the will alone is abiding in great
peace,--while, on the other hand, the understanding and the
memory are so free, that they can be employed in affairs and be
occupied in works of charity.  I say this, that you, my father,
may see it is so, and understand the matter when it shall happen
to yourself; at least, it carried me out of myself, and that is
the reason why I speak of it here.

6. It differs from the prayer of quiet, of which I have
spoken, [2] though it does seem as if it were all one with it.
In that prayer, the soul, which would willingly neither stir nor
move, is delighting in the holy repose of Mary; but in this
prayer it can be like Martha also. [3]  Accordingly, the soul is,
as it were, living the active and contemplative life at once, and
is able to apply itself to works of charity and the affairs of
its state, and to spiritual reading.  Still, those who arrive at
this state, are not wholly masters of themselves, and are well
aware that the better part of the soul is elsewhere.  It is as if
we were speaking to one person, and another speaking to us at the
same time, while we ourselves are not perfectly attentive either
to the one or the other.  It is a state that is most easily
ascertained, and one, when attained to, that ministers great joy
and contentment, and that prepares the soul in the highest
degree, by observing times of solitude, or of freedom from
business, for the attainment of the most tranquil quietude.
It is like the life of a man who is full, requiring no food, with
his appetite satisfied, so that he will not eat of everything set
before him, yet not so full either as to refuse to eat if he saw
any desirable food.  So the soul has no satisfaction in the
world, and seeks no pleasure in it then; because it has in itself
that which gives it a greater satisfaction, greater joys in God,
longings for the satisfaction of its longing to have a deeper joy
in being with Him--this is what the soul seeks.

7. There is another kind of union, which, though not a perfect
union, is yet more so than the one of which I have just spoken;
but not so much so as this spoken of as the third water. You, my
father, will be delighted greatly if our Lord should bestow them
all upon you, if you have them not already, to find an account of
the matter in writing, and to understand it; for it is one grace
that our Lord gives grace; and it is another grace to understand
what grace and what gift it is; and it is another and further
grace to have the power to describe and explain it to others.
Though it does not seem that more than the first of these--the
giving of the grace--is necessary to enable the soul to advance
without confusion and fear, and to walk with the greater courage
in the way of our Lord, trampling under foot all the things of
this world, it is a great advantage and a great grace to
understand it; for every one who has it has great reason to
praise our Lord; and so, also, has he who has it not: because His
Majesty has bestowed it upon some person living who is to make us
profit by it.

8. This union, of which I would now speak, frequently occurs,
particularly to myself.  God has very often bestowed such a grace
upon me, whereby He constrains the will, and even the
understanding, as it seems to me, seeing that it makes no
reflections, but is occupied in the fruition of God: like a
person who looks on, and sees so many things, that he knows not
where to look--one object puts another out of sight, and none of
them leaves any impression behind.

9. The memory remains free, and it must be so, together with the
imagination; and so, when it finds itself alone, it is marvellous
to behold what war it makes on the soul, and how it labours to
throw everything into disorder.  As for me, I am wearied by it,
and I hate it; and very often do I implore our Lord to deprive me
of it on these occasions, if I am to be so much troubled by it.
Now and then, I say to Him: O my God, when shall my soul praise
Thee without distraction, not dissipated in this way, unable to
control itself!  I understand now the mischief that sin has done,
in that it has rendered us unable to do what we desire--to be
always occupied in God. [4]

10. I say that it happens to me from time to time,--it has done
so this very day, and so I remember it well,--to see my soul tear
itself, in order to find itself there where the greater part of
it is, and to see, at the same time, that it is impossible:
because the memory and the imagination assail it with such force,
that it cannot prevail against them; yet, as the other faculties
give them no assistance, they are not able to do it any
harm--none whatever; they do enough when they trouble its rest.
When I say they do no harm, my meaning is, that they cannot
really hurt it, because they have not strength enough, and
because they are too discursive.  As the understanding gives no
help, neither much nor little, in the matters put before the
soul, they never rest anywhere, but hurry to and fro, like
nothing else but gnats at night, troublesome and unquiet: and so
they go about from one subject to another.

11. This comparison seems to me to be singularly to the purpose;
for the memory and the imagination, though they have no power to
do any harm, are very troublesome.  I know of no remedy for it;
and, hitherto, God has told me of none.  If He had, most gladly
would I make use of it; for I am, as I say, tormented very often.
This shows our wretchedness and brings out most distinctly the
great power of God, seeing that the faculty which is free hurts
and wearies us so much; while the others, occupied with His
Majesty, give us rest.

12. The only remedy I have found, after many years of weariness,
is that I spoke of when I was describing the prayer of quiet: [5]
to make no more account of it than of a madman, but let it go
with its subject; for God alone can take it from it,--in short,
it is a slave here.  We must bear patiently with it, as Jacob
bore with Lia; for our Lord showeth us mercy enough when we are
allowed to have Rachel with us.

13. I say that it remains a slave; for, after all, let it do what
it will, it cannot drag the other faculties in its train; on the
contrary, they, without taking any trouble, compel it to follow
after them.  Sometimes God is pleased to take pity on it, when He
sees it so lost and so unquiet, through the longing it has to be
united with the other faculties, and His Majesty consents to its
burning itself in the flame of that divine candle by which the
others are already reduced to ashes, and their nature lost,
being, as it were, supernaturally in the fruition of blessings
so great.

14. In all these states of prayer of which I have spoken, while
explaining this last method of drawing the water out of the well,
so great is the bliss and repose of the soul, that even the body
most distinctly shares in its joy and delight,--and this is most
plain; and the virtues continue to grow, as I said before. [6]
It seems to have been the good pleasure of our Lord to explain
these states of prayer, wherein the soul finds itself, with the
utmost clearness possible, I think, here on earth.

15. Do you, my father, discuss it with any spiritual person who
has arrived at this state, and is learned. If  he says of it, it
is well, you may believe that God has spoken it, and you will
give thanks to His Majesty; for, as I said just now, [7] in the
course of time you will rejoice greatly in that you have
understood it.  Meanwhile, if He does not allow you to understand
what it is, though He does give you the possession of it, yet,
with your intellect and learning, seeing that His Majesty has
given you the first, you will know what it is, by the help of
what I have written here.  Unto Him be praise for ever and
ever!  Amen.

Chapter XVIII.


The Fourth State of Prayer.  The Great Dignity of the Soul Raised
to It by Our Lord.  Attainable on Earth, Not by Our Merit, but by
the Goodness of Our Lord.


1. May our Lord teach me words whereby I may in some measure
describe the fourth water. [1]  I have great need of His
help--even more than I had while speaking of the last; for in
that the soul still feels that it is not dead altogether.  We may
thus speak, seeing that to the world it is really dead.  But, as
I have said, [2] it retains the sense to see that it is in the
world, and to feel its own loneliness; and it makes use of that
which is outward for the purpose of manifesting its feelings, at
least by signs.  In the whole of the prayer already spoken of,
and in all the states of it, the gardener undergoes some labour:
though in the later states the labour is attended with so much
bliss and comfort of the soul, that the soul would never
willingly pass out of it,--and thus the labour is not felt as
labour, but as bliss.

2. In this the fourth state there is no sense of anything, only
fruition, without understanding what that is the fruition of
which is granted.  It is understood that the fruition is of a
certain good containing in itself all good together at once; but
this good is not comprehended.  The senses are all occupied in
this fruition in such a way that not one of them is at liberty,
so as to be able to attend to anything else, whether outward
or inward.

3. The senses were permitted before, as I have said, [3] to give
some signs of the great joy they feel; but now, in this state,
the joy of the soul is incomparably greater, and the power of
showing it is still less; for there is no power in the body, and
the soul has none, whereby this fruition can be made known.
Everything of that kind would be a great hindrance, a torment,
and a disturbance of its rest.  And I say, if it really be a
union of all the faculties, that the soul, even if it wished,--I
mean, when it is in union,--cannot make it known; and if it can,
then it is not union at all.

4. How this, which we call union, is effected, and what it is, I
cannot tell.  Mystical theology explains it, and I do not know
the terms of that science; nor can I understand what the mind is,
nor how it differs from the soul or the spirit either: all three
seem to me but one; though I do know that the soul sometimes
leaps forth out of itself, like a fire that is burning and is
become a flame; and occasionally this fire increases
violently--the flame ascends high above the fire; but it is not
therefore a different thing: it is still the same flame of the
same fire.  Your learning, my fathers, will enable you to
understand the matter; I can go no further.

5. What I undertake to explain is that which the soul feels when
it is in the divine union.  It is plain enough what union is--two
distinct things becoming one.  O my Lord, how good Thou art!
Blessed be Thou for ever, O my God!  Let all creatures praise
Thee, Who hast so loved us that we can truly speak of this
communication which Thou hast with souls in this our exile!
Yea, even if they be good souls, it is on Thy part great
munificence and magnanimity,--in a word, it is Thy munificence, O
my Lord, seeing that Thou givest like Thyself.  O infinite
Munificence!--how magnificent are Thy works!  Even he whose
understanding is not occupied with the things of earth is amazed
that he is unable to understand these truths.  Why, then, give
graces so high to souls who have been such great sinners?
Truly, this passeth my understanding; and when I come to think of
it, I can get no further.  Is there any way at all for me to go
on which is not a going back?  For, as to giving Thee thanks for
mercies so great, I know not how to do it.  Sometimes I relieve
myself by giving utterance to follies.  It often happens to me,
either when I receive these graces, or when God is about to
bestow them,--for, in the midst of them, I have already said, [4]
I was able to do nothing,--that I would break out into words
like these.

6. O Lord, consider what Thou art doing; forget not so soon the
great evils that I have done.  To forgive me, Thou must already
have forgotten them; yet, in order that there may be some limit
to Thy graces, I beseech Thee remember them.  O my Creator, pour
not a liquor so precious into a vessel so broken; for Thou hast
already seen how on other occasions I allowed it to run waste.
Lay not up treasure like this, where the longing after the
consolations of this life is not so mortified as it ought to be;
for it will be utterly lost.  How canst Thou commit the defence
of the city, and the keys of its fortress to a commander so
cowardly, who at the first assault will let the enemy enter
within?  Oh, let not Thy love be so great, O King Eternal, as to
imperil jewels so precious!  O my Lord, to me it seems that it
becomes a ground for undervaluing them, when Thou puttest them in
the power of one so wretched, so vile, so frail, so miserable,
and so worthless as I am, who, though she may labour not to lose
them, by the help of Thy grace,--and I have need of no little
grace for that end, being what I am,--is not able to win over any
one to Thee,--in short, I am a woman, not good, but wicked.
It seems to me that the talents are not only hidden, but buried,
when they are committed to earth so vile.  It is not Thy wont, O
Lord, to bestow graces and mercies like these upon a soul, unless
it be that it may edify many.

7. Thou, O my God, knowest already that I beg this of Thee with
my whole will, from the bottom of my heart, and that I have done
so more than once, and I account it a blessing to lose the
greatest blessings which may be had on earth, if Thou wouldst but
bestow these graces upon him who will make a better use of them
to the increase of Thy glory.  These, and expressions like these,
it has happened to me often to utter.  I saw afterwards my own
foolishness and want of humility; for our Lord knoweth well what
is expedient, and that there is no strength in my soul to be
saved, if His Majesty did not give it with graces so great.

8. I purpose also to speak of the graces and effects which abide
in the soul, and of that which the soul itself can do, or rather,
if it can do anything of itself towards attaining to a state so
high.  The elevation of the spirit, or union, comes together with
heavenly love but, as I understand it, union is a different thing
from elevation in union itself.  To him who may not have had any
experience of the latter, it must seem that it is not; and,
according to my view of it, even if they are both one, the
operations of our Lord therein are different: there is a growth
of the soul's detachment from creatures more abundantly still in
the flight of the spirit. [5]  I have clearly seen that this is a
particular grace, though, as I say, it may be the same, or seem
to be so, with the other; but a little fire, also, is as much
fire as a great fire--and yet there is a visible difference
between them.  Before a small piece of iron is made red-hot in a
little fire, some time must pass; but if the fire be great, the
iron very quickly, though bulky, loses its nature altogether
in appearance.

9. So, it seems to me, is it with these two kinds of graces which
our Lord bestows.  He who has had raptures will, I am sure,
understand it well; to him who has not had that experience, it
must appear folly.  And, indeed, it may well be so; for if a
person like myself should speak of a matter of this kind, and
give any explanation at all of that for the description of which
no words ever can possibly be found, it is not to be wondered at
that I may be speaking foolishly.

10. But I have this confidence in our Lord, that He will help me
here; for His Majesty knoweth that my object in writing--the
first is to obey--is to inspire souls with a longing after so
high a good.  I will speak of nothing that I do not know by great
experience: and so, when I began to describe the last kind of
water, I thought it more impossible for me to speak of it at all
than to speak Greek.  It is a very difficult matter; so I left
it, and went to Communion.  Blessed be our Lord, who is merciful
to the ignorant!  Oh, virtue of obedience! it can do everything!
God enlightened my understanding--at one time suggesting the
words, at another showing me how to use them; for, as in the
preceding state of prayer, so also now, His Majesty seems to
utter what I can neither speak nor understand. [6]

11. What I am saying is the simple truth; and therefore whatever
is good herein is His teaching; what is erroneous, clearly comes
out of that sea of evil--myself.  If there be any--and there must
be many--who, having attained to these states of prayer whereunto
our Lord in His mercy has brought me--wretch that I am!--and who,
thinking they have missed their way, desire to treat of these
matters with me, I am sure that our Lord will help His servant to
declare the truth more plainly.

12. I am now speaking of the water which cometh down from heaven
to fill and saturate in its abundance the whole of this garden
with water.  If our Lord never ceased to pour it down whenever it
was necessary, the gardener certainly would have plenty of rest;
and if there were no winter, but an ever temperate season, fruits
and flowers would never fail.  The gardener would have his
delight therein; but in this life that is impossible.  We must
always be careful, when one water fails, to obtain another.
This water from heaven comes down very often when the gardener
least expects it.

13. The truth is that, in the beginning, this almost always
happens after much mental prayer.  Our Lord advances step by step
to lay hold of the little bird, and to lay it in the nest where
it may repose.  He observed it fluttering for a long time,
striving with the understanding and the will, and with all its
might, to seek God and to please Him; so now it is His pleasure
to reward it even in this life.  And what a reward!--one moment
is enough to repay all the possible trials of this life.

14. The soul, while thus seeking after God, is conscious, with a
joy excessive and sweet, that it is, as it were, utterly fainting
away in a kind of trance: breathing, and all the bodily strength,
fail it, so that it cannot even move the hands without great
pain; the eyes close involuntarily, and if they are open, they
are as if they saw nothing; nor is reading possible,--the very
letters seem strange, and cannot be distinguished,--the letters,
indeed, are visible, but, as the understanding furnishes no help,
all reading is impracticable, though seriously attempted.
The ear hears; but what is heard is not comprehended.  The senses
are of no use whatever, except to hinder the soul's fruition; and
so they rather hurt it.  It is useless to try to speak, because
it is not possible to conceive a word; nor, if it were conceived,
is there strength sufficient to utter it; for all bodily strength
vanishes, and that of the soul increases, to enable it the better
to have the fruition of its joy.  Great and most perceptible,
also, is the outward joy now felt.

15. This prayer, however long it may last, does no harm--at
least, it has never done any to me; nor do I remember, however
ill I might have been when our Lord had mercy upon me in this
way, that I ever felt the worse for it--on the contrary, I was
always better afterwards.  But so great a blessing, what harm can
it do?  The outward effects are so plain as to leave no doubt
possible that there must have been some great cause, seeing that
it thus robs us of our bodily powers with so much joy, in order
to leave them greater.

16. The truth is, it passes away so quickly in the beginning--at
least, so it was with me--that neither by the outward signs, nor
by the failure of the senses, can it be perceived when it passes
so quickly away.  But it is plain, from the overflowing abundance
of grace, that the brightness of the sun which had shone there
must have been great, seeing that it has thus made the soul to
melt away.  And this is to be considered; for, as it seems to me,
the period of time, however long it may have been, during which
the faculties of the soul were entranced, is very short; if half
an hour, that would be a long time.  I do not think that I have
ever been so long. [7]  The truth of the matter is this: it is
extremely difficult to know how long, because the senses are in
suspense; but I think that at any time it cannot be very long
before some one of the faculties recovers itself.  It is the will
that persists in the work; the other two faculties quickly begin
to molest it.  As the will is calm, it entrances them again; they
are quiet for another moment, and then they recover themselves
once more.

17. In this way, some hours may be, and are, passed in prayer;
for when the two faculties begin to drink deep, and to perceive
the taste of this divine wine, they give themselves up with great
readiness, in order to be the more absorbed: they follow the
will, and the three rejoice together.  But this state of complete
absorption, together with the utter rest of the imagination,--for
I believe that even the imagination is then wholly at
rest,--lasts only for a short time; though the faculties do not
so completely recover themselves as not to be for some hours
afterwards as if in disorder: God, from time to time, drawing
them to Himself.

18. Let us now come to that which the soul feels interiorly.
Let him describe it who knows it; for as it is impossible to
understand it, much more is it so to describe it.  When I
purposed to write this, I had just communicated, and had risen
from the very prayer of which I am speaking.  I am thinking of
what the soul was then doing.  Our Lord said to me: It undoes
itself utterly, My daughter, in order that it may give itself
more and more to Me: it is not itself that then lives, it is I.
As it cannot comprehend what it understands, it understands by
not understanding. [8]

19. He who has had experience of this will understand it in some
measure, for it cannot be more clearly described, because what
then takes place is so obscure.  All I am able to say is, that
the soul is represented as being close to God; and that there
abides a conviction thereof so certain and strong, that it cannot
possibly help believing so.  All the faculties fail now, and are
suspended in such a way that, as I said before, [9] their
operations cannot be traced.  If the soul is making a meditation
on any subject, the memory of it is lost at once, just as if it
had never been thought of.  If it reads, what is read is not
remembered nor dwelt upon; neither is it otherwise with vocal
prayer.  Accordingly, the restless little butterfly of the memory
has its wings burnt now, and it cannot fly.  The will must be
fully occupied in loving, but it understands not how it loves;
the understanding, if it understands, does not understand how it
understands--at least, it can comprehend nothing of that it
understands: it does not understand, as it seems to me, because,
as I said just now, this cannot be understood.  I do not
understand it at all myself.

20. In the beginning, it happened to me that I was ignorant of
one thing--I did not know that God was in all things: [10] and
when He seemed to me to be so near, I thought it impossible.
Not to believe that He was present, was not in my power; for it
seemed to me, as it were, evident that I felt there His very
presence.  Some unlearned men used to say to me, that He was
present only by His grace.  I could not believe that, because, as
I am saying, He seemed to me to be present Himself: so I was
distressed.  A most learned man, of the Order of the glorious
Patriarch St. Dominic, delivered me from this doubt; for he told
me that He was present, and how He communed with us: this was a
great comfort to me.

21. It is to be observed and understood that this water from
heaven,--this greatest grace of our Lord--always leaves in the
soul the greatest fruits, as I shall now show.

Chapter XIX.


The Effects of This Fourth State of Prayer.  Earnest Exhortations
to Those Who Have Attained to It Not to Go Back, Nor to Cease
from Prayer, Even if They Fall.  The Great Calamity of
Going Back.


1. There remains in the soul, when the prayer of union is over,
an exceedingly great tenderness; so much so, that it would undo
itself--not from pain, but through tears of joy it finds itself
bathed therein, without being aware of it, and it knows not how
or when it wept them.  But to behold the violence of the fire
subdued by the water, which yet makes it burn the more, gives it
great delight.  It seems as if I were speaking an unknown
language.  So it is, however.

2. It has happened to me occasionally, when this prayer was over,
to be so beside myself as not to know whether I had been
dreaming, or whether the bliss I felt had really been mine; and,
on finding myself in a flood of tears--which had painlessly
flowed, with such violence and rapidity that it seemed as if a
cloud from heaven [1] had shed them--to perceive that it was no
dream.  Thus it was with me in the beginning, when it passed
quickly away.  The soul remains possessed of so much courage,
that if it were now hewn in pieces for God, it would be a great
consolation to it.  This is the time of resolutions, of heroic
determinations, of the living energy of good desires, of the
beginning of hatred of the world, and of the most clear
perception of its vanity.  The soul makes greater and higher
progress than it ever made before in the previous states of
prayer; and grows in humility more and more, because it sees
clearly that neither for obtaining nor for retaining this grace,
great beyond all measure, has it ever done, or ever been able to
do, anything of itself. It looks upon itself as most
unworthy--for in a room into which the sunlight enters strongly,
not a cobweb can be hid; it sees its own misery; self-conceit is
so far away, that it seems as if it never could have had any--for
now its own eyes behold how very little it could ever do, or
rather, that it never did anything, that it hardly gave even its
own consent, but that it rather seemed as if the doors of the
senses were closed against its will in order that it might have
more abundantly the fruition of our Lord.  It is abiding alone
with Him: what has it to do but to love Him?  It neither sees nor
hears, unless on compulsion: no thanks to it.  Its past life
stands before it then, together with the great mercy of God, in
great distinctness; and it is not necessary for it to go forth to
hunt with the understanding, because what it has to eat and
ruminate upon, it sees now ready prepared.  It sees, so far as
itself is concerned, that it has deserved hell, and that its
punishment is bliss.  It undoes itself in the praises of God, and
I would gladly undo myself now.

3. Blessed be Thou, O my Lord, who, out of a pool so filthy as I
am, bringest forth water so clean as to be meet for Thy table!
Praised be Thou, O Joy of the Angels, who hast been thus pleased
to exalt so vile a worm!

4. The good effects of this prayer abide in the soul for some
time.  Now that it clearly apprehends that the fruit is not its
own, the soul can begin to share it with others, and that without
any loss to itself.  It begins to show signs of its being a soul
that is guarding the treasures of heaven, and to be desirous of
communicating them to others, [2] and to pray to God that itself
may not be the only soul that is rich in them.  It begins to
benefit its neighbours, as it were, without being aware of it, or
doing anything consciously: its neighbours understand the matter,
because the odour of the flowers has grown so strong as to make
them eager to approach them.  They understand that this soul is
full of virtue: they see the fruit, how delicious it is, and they
wish to help that soul to eat it.

5. If this ground be well dug by troubles, by persecutions,
detractions, and infirmities,--they are few who ascend so high
without this,--if it be well broken up by great detachment from
all self-interest, it will drink in so much water that it can
hardly ever be parched again.  But if it be ground which is mere
waste, and covered with thorns (as I was when I began); if the
occasions of sin be not avoided; if it be an ungrateful soil,
unfitted for so great a grace,--it will be parched up again.
If the gardener become careless,--and if our Lord, out of His
mere goodness, will not send down rain upon it,--the garden is
ruined. Thus has it been with me more than once, so that I am
amazed at it; and if I had not found it so by experience, I could
not have believed it.

6. I write this for the comfort of souls which are weak, as I am,
that they may never despair, nor cease to trust in the power of
God; even if they should fall after our Lord has raised them to
so high a degree of prayer as this is, they must not be
discouraged, unless they would lose themselves utterly.
Tears gain everything, and one drop of water attracts another.

7. One of the reasons that move me, who am what I am, under
obedience to write this, and give an account of my wretched life,
and of the graces our Lord has wrought in me,--though I never
served Him, but offended Him rather,--is what I have just given:
and, certainly, I wish I was a person of great authority, that
people might believe what I say.  I pray to our Lord that His
Majesty would be pleased to grant me this grace.  I repeat it,
let no one who has begun to give himself to prayer be
discouraged, and say: If I fall into sin, it will be worse for me
if I go on now with the practice of prayer.  I think so too, if
he gives up prayer, and does not correct his evil ways; but if he
does not give up prayer, let him be assured of this--prayer will
bring him to the haven of light.

8. In this the devil turned his batteries against me, and I
suffered so much because I thought it showed but little humility
if I persevered in prayer when I was so wicked, that--as I have
already said [3]--I gave it up for a year and a half--at least,
for a year, but I do not remember distinctly the other six
months.  This could not have been, neither was it, anything else
but to throw myself down into hell; there was no need of any
devils to drag me thither.  O my God, was there ever blindness so
great as this?  How well Satan prepares his measures for his
purpose, when he pursues us in this way!  The traitor knows that
he has already lost that soul which perseveres in prayer, and
that every fall which he can bring about helps it, by the
goodness of God, to make greater progress in His service.
Satan has some interest in this.

9. O my Jesus, what a sight that must be--a soul so highly
exalted falling into sin, and raised up again by Thee; who, in
Thy mercy, stretchest forth Thine hand to save!  How such a soul
confesses Thy greatness and compassion and its own wretchedness!
It really looks on itself as nothingness, and confesses Thy
power.  It dares not lift up its eyes; it raises them, indeed,
but it is to acknowledge how much it oweth unto Thee.  It becomes
devout to the Queen of Heaven, that she may propitiate Thee; it
invokes the Saints, who fell after Thou hadst called them, for
succour.  Thou seemest now to be too bountiful in Thy gifts,
because it feels itself to be unworthy of the earth it treads on.
It has recourse to the Sacraments, to a quickened faith, which
abides in it at the contemplation of the power which Thou hast
lodged in them.  It praises Thee because Thou hast left us such
medicines and ointment for our wounds, which not only heal them
on the surface, but remove all traces whatever of them.

10. The soul is amazed at it.  Who is there, O Lord of my soul,
that is not amazed at compassion so great and mercy so
surpassing, after treason so foul and so hateful?  I know not how
it is that my heart does not break when I write this, for I am
wicked.  With these scanty tears which I am now weeping, but yet
Thy gift,--water out of a well, so far as it is mine, so
impure,--I seem to make Thee some recompense for treachery so
great as mine, in that I was always doing evil, labouring to make
void the graces Thou hast given me.  Do Thou, O Lord, make my
tears available; purify the water which is so muddy; at least,
let me not be to others a temptation to rash judgments, as I have
been to myself, when I used to think such thoughts as these.
Why, O Lord, dost Thou pass by most holy persons, who have always
served Thee, and who have been tried; who have been brought up in
religion, and are really religious--not such as I am, having only
the name--so as to make it plain that they are not recipients of
those graces which Thou hast bestowed upon me?

11. I see clearly now, O Thou my Good, Thou hast kept the reward
to give it them all at once: my weakness has need of these
succours.  They, being strong, serve Thee without them, and Thou
dealest with them as with a strong race, free from all
self-interest.  But yet Thou knowest, O my Lord, that I have
often cried unto Thee, making excuses for those who murmured
against me; for I thought they had reason on their side.  This I
did then when Thou of Thy goodness hadst kept me back from
offending Thee so much, and when I was departing from everything
which I thought displeasing unto Thee.  It was when I did this
that Thou, O Lord, didst begin to lay open Thy treasures for Thy
servant.  It seemed as if Thou wert looking for nothing else but
that I should be willing and ready to receive them; accordingly,
Thou didst begin at once, not only to give them, but also to make
others know that Thou wert giving them.

12. When this was known, there began to prevail a good opinion of
her, of whom all had not yet clearly understood how wicked she
was, though much of that wickedness was plain enough. Calumny and
persecution began at once, and, as I think, with good reason; so
I looked on none of them as an enemy, but made my supplications
to Thee, imploring Thee to consider the grounds they had.
They said that I wished to be a saint, and that I invented
novelties; but I had not then attained in many things even to the
observance of my rule; nor had I come near those excellent and
holy nuns who were in the house,--and I do not believe I ever
shall, if God of His goodness will not do that for me Himself; on
the contrary, I was there only to do away with what was good, and
introduce customs which were not good; at least, I did what I
could to bring them in, and I was very powerful for evil.
Thus it was that they were blameless, when they blamed me.  I do
not mean the nuns only, but the others as well: they told me
truths; for it was Thy will.

13. I was once saying the Office,--I had had this temptation for
some time,--and when I came to these words, "Justus es, Domine,
et rectum judicium tuum," [4] I began to think what a deep truth
it was.  Satan never was strong enough to tempt me in any way to
doubt of Thy goodness, or of any article of the faith: on the
contrary, it seems to me that the more these truths were above
nature, the more firmly I held them, and my devotion grew; when I
thought of Thy omnipotence, I accepted all Thy wonderful works,
and I say it again, I never had a doubt.  Then, as I was thinking
how it could be just in Thee to allow so many, who, as I said,
are Thy most faithful servants, to remain without those
consolations and graces which Thou hast given to me, who am what
I am, Thou, O my Lord, didst answer me: Serve thou Me, and meddle
not with this.

14. This was the first word which I ever heard Thee speak to me,
and it made me greatly afraid.  But as I shall speak
hereafter [5] of this way of hearing, and of other matters, I say
nothing here; for to do so would be to digress from my subject,
and I have already made digressions enough.  I scarcely know what
I have said, nor can it be otherwise; but you, my father, must
bear with these interruptions; for when I consider what God must
have borne with from me, and when I see the state I am in, it is
not strange that I should wander in what I am saying, and what I
have still to say.

15. May it please our Lord that my wanderings may be of this
kind, and may His Majesty never suffer me to have strength to
resist Him even in the least; yea, rather than that, may He
destroy me this moment.  It is evidence enough of His great
compassions, that He has forgiven so much ingratitude, not once,
but often.  He forgave St. Peter once; but I have been forgiven
many times.  Satan had good reasons for tempting me: I ought
never to have pretended to a strict friendship with One, my
hatred of whom I made so public.  Was there ever blindness so
great as mine?  Where could I think I should find help but in
Thee?  What folly to run away from the light, to be for ever
stumbling!  What a proud humility was that which Satan devised
for me, when I ceased to lean upon the pillar, and threw the
staff away which supported me, in order that my fall might not
be great! [6]

16. I make the sign of the cross this moment.  I do not think I
ever escaped so great a danger as this device of Satan, which he
would have imposed upon me in the disguise of humility. [7]
He filled me with such thoughts as these: How could I make my
prayer, who was so wicked, and yet had received so many mercies?
It was enough for me to recite the Office, as all others did; but
as I did not that much well, how could I desire to do more?
I was not reverential enough, and made too little of the mercies
of God.  There was no harm in these thoughts and feelings in
themselves; but to act upon them, that was an exceedingly great
wickedness.  Blessed be Thou, O Lord; for Thou camest to my help.
This seems to me to be in principle the temptation of Judas, only
that Satan did not dare to tempt me so openly.  But he might have
led me by little and little, as he led Judas, to the same pit
of destruction.

17. Let all those who give themselves to prayer, for the love of
God, look well to this.  They should know that when I was
neglecting it, my life was much worse than it had ever been; let
them reflect on the excellent help and the pleasant humility
which Satan provided for me: it was a grave interior disquietude.
But how could my spirit be quiet?  It was going away in its
misery from its true rest.  I remembered the graces and mercies I
had received, and felt that the joys of this world were
loathsome.  I am astonished that I was able to bear it.  It must
have been the hope I had; for, as well as I can remember now, it
is more than twenty-one years ago.  I do not think I ever gave up
my purpose of resuming my prayer; but I was waiting to be very
free from sin first.

18. Oh, how deluded I was in this expectation!  The devil would
have held it out before me till the day of judgment, that he
might then take me with him to hell.  Then, when I applied myself
to prayer and to spiritual reading,--whereby I might perceive
these truths, and the evil nature of the way I was walking in,
and was often importunate with our Lord in tears,--I was so
wicked, that it availed me nothing; when I gave that up, and
wasted my time in amusing myself, in great danger of falling into
sin, and with scanty helps,--and I may venture to say no help at
all, unless it was a help to my ruin,--what could I expect but
that of which I have spoken?

19. I believe that a certain Dominican friar, a most learned man,
has greatly merited in the eyes of God; for it was he who roused
me from this slumber.  He made me--I think I said so
before [8]--go to Communion once a fortnight, and be less given
to evil; I began to be converted, though I did not cease to
offend our Lord all at once: however, as I had not lost my way, I
walked on in it, though slowly, falling and rising again; and he
who does not cease to walk and press onwards, arrives at last,
even if late.  To lose one's way is--so it seems to me--nothing
else but the giving up of prayer.  God, of His mercy, keeps us
from this!

20. It is clear from this,--and, for the love of God, consider it
well,--that a soul, though it may receive great graces from God
in prayer, must never rely on itself, because it may fall, nor
expose itself in any way whatever to any risks of sin.  This
should be well considered because much depends on it; for the
delusion here, wherein Satan is able to entangle us afterwards,
though the grace be really from God, lies in the traitor's making
use of that very grace, so far as he can, for his own purpose,
and particularly against persons not grown strong in virtues, who
are neither mortified nor detached; for these are not at present
strong enough--as I shall explain hereafter [9]--to expose
themselves to dangerous occasions, notwithstanding the noble
desires and resolutions they may have.

21. This doctrine is excellent, and not mine, but the teaching of
God, and accordingly I wish ignorant people like myself knew it;
for even if a soul were in this state, it must not rely so much
upon itself as to go forth to the battle, because it will have
enough to do in defending itself.  Defensive armour is the
present necessity; the soul is not yet strong enough to assail
Satan, and to trample him under foot, as those are who are in the
state of which I shall speak further on. [10]

22. This is the delusion by which Satan prevails: when a soul
sees itself so near unto God, when it sees the difference there
is between the things of heaven and those of earth, and when it
sees the love which our Lord bears it, there grows out of that
love a certain trust and confidence that there is to be no
falling away from that the fruition of which it then possesses.
It seems to see the reward distinctly, as if it were impossible
for it to abandon that which, even in this life, is so delicious
and sweet, for anything so mean and impure as worldly joy.
Through this confidence, Satan robs it of that distrust which it
ought to have in itself; and so, as I have just said, [11] the
soul exposes itself to dangers, and begins, in the fulness of its
zeal, to give away without discretion the fruit of its garden,
thinking that now it has no reason to be afraid for itself.
Yet this does not come out of pride; for the soul clearly
understands that of itself it can do no good thing; but rather
out of an excessive confidence in God, without discretion:
because the soul does not see itself to be unfledged.  It can go
forth out of its nest, and God Himself may take it out, but still
it cannot fly, because the virtues are not strong, and itself has
no experience wherewith to discern the dangers; nor is it aware
of the evil which trusting to itself may do it.

23. This it was that ruined me.  Now, to understand this, and
everything else in the spiritual life, we have great need of a
director, and of conference with spiritual persons.  I fully
believe, with respect to that soul which God raises to this
state, that He will not cease to be gracious to it, nor suffer it
to be lost, if it does not utterly forsake His Majesty.  But when
that soul--as I said--falls, let it look to it again and again,
for the love of our Lord, that Satan deceive it not by tempting
it to give up prayer, as he tempted me, through that false
humility of which I have spoken before, [12] and would gladly
speak of again and again.  Let it rely on the goodness of God,
which is greater than all the evil we can do.  When we,
acknowledging our own vileness, desire to return into His grace,
He remembers our ingratitude no more,--no, not even the graces He
has given us, for the purpose of chastising us, because of our
misuse of them; yea, rather, they help to procure our pardon the
sooner, as of persons who have been members of His household, and
who, as they say, have eaten of His bread.

24. Let them remember His words, and behold what He hath done
unto me, who grew weary of sinning before He grew weary of
forgiving.  He is never weary of giving, nor can His compassion
be exhausted.  Let us not grow weary ourselves of receiving.
May He be blessed for ever, Amen; and may all created things
praise Him!

Chapter XX.


The Difference Between Union and Rapture.  What Rapture Is.
The Blessing It Is to the Soul.  The Effects of It.


1. I wish I could explain, with the help of God, wherein union
differs from rapture, or from transport, or from flight of the
spirit, as they speak, or from a trance, which are all one. [1]
I mean, that all these are only different names for that one and
the same thing, which is also called ecstasy. [2]  It is more
excellent than union, the fruits of it are much greater, and its
other operations more manifold; for union is uniform in the
beginning, the middle, and the end, and is so also interiorly.
But as raptures have ends of a much higher kind, they produce
effects both within and without. [3]  As our Lord has explained
the other matters, so also may He explain this; for certainly, if
He had not shown me in what way and by what means this
explanation was in some measure possible, I should never have
been able to do it.

2. Consider we now that this last water, of which I am speaking,
is so abundant that, were it not that the ground refuses to
receive it, we might suppose that the cloud of His great Majesty
is here raining down upon us on earth.  And when we are giving
Him thanks for this great mercy, drawing near to Him in earnest,
with all our might, then it is our Lord draws up the soul, as the
clouds, so to speak, gather the mists from the face of the earth,
and carries it away out of itself,--I have heard it said that the
clouds, or the sun, draw the mists together, [4]--and as a cloud,
rising up to heaven, takes the soul with Him, and begins to show
it the treasures of the kingdom which He has prepared for it.
I know not whether the comparison be accurate or not; but the
fact is, that is the way in which it is brought about.
During rapture, the soul does not seem to animate the body, the
natural heat of which is perceptibly lessened; the coldness
increases, though accompanied with exceeding joy
and sweetness. [5]

3. A rapture is absolutely irresistible; whilst union, inasmuch
as we are then on our own ground, may be hindered, though that
resistance be painful and violent; it is, however, almost always
impossible.  But rapture, for the most part, is irresistible.
It comes, in general, as a shock, quick and sharp, before you can
collect your thoughts, or help yourself in any way, and you see
and feel it as a cloud, or a strong eagle rising upwards, and
carrying you away on its wings.

4. I repeat it: you feel and see yourself carried away, you know
not whither.  For though we feel how delicious it is, yet the
weakness of our nature makes us afraid at first, and we require a
much more resolute and courageous spirit than in the previous
states, in order to risk everything, come what may, and to
abandon ourselves into the hands of God, and go willingly whither
we are carried, seeing that we must be carried away, however
painful it may be; and so trying is it, that I would very often
resist, and exert all my strength, particularly at those times
when the rapture was coming on me in public.  I did so, too, very
often when I was alone, because I was afraid of delusions.
Occasionally I was able, by great efforts, to make a slight
resistance; but afterwards I was worn out, like a person who had
been contending with a strong giant; at other times it was
impossible to resist at all: my soul was carried away, and almost
always my head with it,--I had no power over it,--and now and
then the whole body as well, so that it was lifted up from
the ground.

5. This has not happened to me often: once, however, it took
place when we were all together in choir, and I, on my knees, on
the point of communicating.  It was a very sore distress to me;
for I thought it a most extraordinary thing, and was afraid it
would occasion much talk; so I commanded the nuns--for it
happened after I was made Prioress--never to speak of it.  But at
other times, the moment I felt that our Lord was about to repeat
the act, and once, in particular, during a sermon,--it was the
feast of our house, some great ladies being present,--I threw
myself on the ground; then the nuns came around me to hold me;
but still the rapture was observed.

6. I made many supplications to our Lord, that He would be
pleased to give me no more of those graces which were outwardly
visible; for I was weary of living under such great restraint,
and because His Majesty could not bestow such graces on me
without their becoming known.  It seems that, of His goodness, He
has been pleased to hear my prayer; for I have never been
enraptured since.  It is true that it was not long ago. [6]

7. It seemed to me, when I tried to make some resistance, as if a
great force beneath my feet lifted me up.  I know of nothing with
which to compare it; but it was much more violent than the other
spiritual visitations, and I was therefore as one ground to
pieces; for it is a great struggle, and, in short, of little use,
whenever our Lord so wills it.  There is no power against
His power.

8. At other times He is pleased to be satisfied when He makes us
see that He is ready to give us this grace, and that it is not He
that withholds it.  Then, when we resist it out of humility, He
produces those very effects which would have resulted if we had
fully consented to it.

9. The effects of rapture are great: one is that the mighty power
of our Lord is manifested; and as we are not strong enough, when
His Majesty wills it, to control either soul or body, so neither
have we any power over it; but, whether we like it or not, we see
that there is one mightier than we are, that these graces are His
gifts, and that of ourselves we can do nothing whatever; and
humility is deeply imprinted in us.  And further, I confess that
it threw me into great fear, very great indeed at first; for when
I saw my body thus lifted up from the earth, how could I help it?
Though the spirit draws it upwards after itself, and that with
great sweetness, if unresisted, the senses are not lost; at
least, I was so much myself as to be able to see that I was being
lifted up.  The majesty of Him who can effect this so manifests
itself, that the hairs of my head stand upright, [7] and a great
fear comes upon me of offending God, who is so mighty.  This fear
is bound up in exceedingly great love, which is acquired anew,
and directed to Him, who, we see, bears so great a love to a worm
so vile, and who seems not to be satisfied with attracting the
soul to Himself in so real a way, but who will have the body
also, though it be mortal and of earth so foul, such as it is
through our sins, which are so great.

10. Rapture leaves behind a certain strange detachment also,
which I shall never be able to describe; I think I can say that
it is in some respects different from--yea, higher than--the
other graces, which are simply spiritual; for though these effect
a complete detachment in spirit from all things, it seems that in
this of rapture our Lord would have the body itself to be
detached also: and thus a certain singular estrangement from the
things of earth is wrought, which makes life much more
distressing.  Afterwards it causes a pain, which we can never
inflict of ourselves, nor remove when once it has come.

11. I should like very much to explain this great pain, and I
believe I shall not be able; however, I will say something if I
can.  And it is to be observed that this is my present state, and
one to which I have been brought very lately, after all the
visions and revelations of which I shall speak, and after that
time, wherein I gave myself to prayer, in which our Lord gave me
so much sweetness and delight. [8]  Even now I have that
sweetness occasionally; but it is the pain of which I speak that
is the most frequent and the most common.  It varies in its
intensity.  I will now speak of it when it is sharpest; for I
shall speak later on [9] of the great shocks I used to feel when
our Lord would throw me into those trances, and which are, in my
opinion, as different from this pain as the most corporeal thing
is from the most spiritual; and I believe that I am not
exaggerating much. For though the soul feels that pain, it is in
company with the body; [10] both soul and body apparently share
it, and it is not attended with that extremity of abandonment
which belongs to this.

12. As I said before, [11] we have no part in causing this pain;
but very often there springs up a desire unexpectedly,--I know
not how it comes,--and because of this desire, which pierces the
soul in a moment, the soul begins to be wearied, so much so that
it rises upwards above itself, and above all created things. God
then so strips it of everything, that, do what it may, there is
nothing on earth that can be its companion.  Neither, indeed,
would it wish to have any; it would rather die in that
loneliness.  If people spoke to it, and if itself made every
effort possible to speak, it would be of little use: the spirit,
notwithstanding all it may do, cannot be withdrawn from that
loneliness; and though God seems, as it were, far away from the
soul at that moment, yet He reveals His grandeurs at times in the
strangest way conceivable.  That way is indescribable; I do not
think any one can believe or comprehend it who has not previously
had experience of it.  It is a communication made, not to
console, but to show the reason why the soul must be weary;
because it is far away from the Good which in itself comprehends
all good.

13. In this communication the desire grows, so also does the
bitterness of that loneliness wherein the soul beholds itself,
suffering a pain so sharp and piercing that, in that very
loneliness in which it dwells, it may literally say of
itself,--and perhaps the royal prophet said so, being in that
very loneliness himself, except that our Lord may have granted to
him, being a saint, to feel it more deeply,--"Vigilavi, et factus
sum sicut passer solitarius in tecto." [12]  These words
presented themselves to me in such a way that I thought I saw
them fulfilled in myself.  It was a comfort to know that others
had felt this extreme loneliness; how much greater my comfort,
when these persons were such as David was!  The soul is then--so
I think--not in itself, but on the house-top, or on the roof,
above itself, and above all created things; for it seems to me to
have its dwelling higher than even in the highest part of itself.

14. On other occasions, the soul seems to be, as it were, in the
utmost extremity of need, asking itself, and saying, "Where is
Thy God?" [13]  And it is to be remembered, that I did not know
how to express in Spanish the meaning of those words.
Afterwards, when I understood what it was, I used to console
myself with the thought, that our Lord, without any effort of
mine, had made me remember them.  At other times, I used to
recollect a saying of St. Paul's, to the effect that he was
crucified to the world. [14] I do not mean that this is true of
me: I know it is not; but I think it is the state of the
enraptured soul.  No consolation reaches it from heaven, and it
is not there itself; it wishes for none from earth, and it is not
there either; but it is, as it were, crucified between heaven and
earth, enduring its passion: receiving no succour from either.

15. Now, the succour it receives from heaven--which, as I have
said, [15] is a most marvellous knowledge of God, above all that
we can desire--brings with it greater pain; for the desire then
so grows, that, in my opinion, its intense painfulness now and
then robs the soul of all sensation; only, it lasts but for a
short time after the senses are suspended.  It seems as if it
were the point of death; only, the agony carries with it so great
a joy, that I know of nothing wherewith to compare it.  It is a
sharp martyrdom, full of sweetness; for if any earthly thing be
then offered to the soul, even though it may be that which it
habitually found most sweet, the soul will have none of it; yea,
it seems to throw it away at once.  The soul sees distinctly that
it seeks nothing but God; yet its love dwells not on any
attribute of Him in particular; it seeks Him as He is, and knows
not what it seeks.  I say that it knows not, because the
imagination forms no representation whatever; and, indeed, as I
think, during much of that time the faculties are at rest.
Pain suspends them then, as joy suspends them in union and in
a trance.

16. O Jesus! oh, that some one would clearly explain this to you,
my father, were it only that you may tell me what it means,
because this is the habitual state of my soul!  Generally, when I
am not particularly occupied, I fall into these agonies of death,
and I tremble when I feel them coming on, because they are not
unto death.  But when I am in them, I then wish to spend therein
all the rest of my life, though the pain be so very great, that I
can scarcely endure it.  Sometimes my pulse ceases, as it were,
to beat at all,--so the sisters say, who sometimes approach me,
and who now understand the matter better,--my bones are racked,
and my hands become so rigid, that I cannot always join them.
Even on the following day I have a pain in my wrists, and over my
whole body, as if my bones were out of joint. [16]  Well, I think
sometimes, if it continues as at present, that it will end, in
the good pleasure of our Lord, by putting an end to my life; for
the pain seems to me sharp enough to cause death; only, I do not
deserve it.

17. All my anxiety at these times is that I should die: I do not
think of purgatory, nor of the great sins I have committed, and
by which I have deserved hell.  I forget everything in my
eagerness to see God; and this abandonment and loneliness seem
preferable to any company in the world.  If anything can be a
consolation in this state, it is to speak to one who has passed
through this trial, seeing that, though the soul may complain of
it, no one seems disposed to believe in it.

18. The soul is tormented also because the pain has increased so
much, that it seeks solitude no longer, as it did before, nor
companionship, unless it be that of those to whom it may make its
complaint.  It is now like a person, who, having a rope around
his neck, and being strangled, tries to breathe. This desire of
companionship seems to me to proceed from our weakness; for, as
pain brings with it the risk of death,--which it certainly does;
for I have been occasionally in danger of death, in my great
sickness and infirmities, as I have said before, [17] and I think
I may say that this pain is as great as any,--so the desire not
to be parted, which possesses soul and body, is that which raises
the cry for succour in order to breathe, and by speaking of it,
by complaining, and distracting itself, causes the soul to seek
means of living very much against the will of the spirit, or the
higher part of the soul, which would not wish to be delivered
from this pain.

19. I am not sure that I am correct in what I say, nor do I know
how to express myself, but to the best of my knowledge it comes
to pass in this way.  See, my father, what rest I can have in
this life, now that what I once had in prayer and
loneliness--therein our Lord used to comfort me--has become in
general a torment of this kind; while, at the same time, it is so
full of sweetness, that the soul, discerning its inestimable
worth, prefers it to all those consolations which it formerly
had.  It seems also to be a safer state, because it is the way of
the cross; and involves, in my opinion, a joy of exceeding worth,
because the state of the body in it is only pain.  It is the soul
that suffers and exults alone in that joy and contentment which
suffering supplies.

20. I know not how this can be, but so it is; it comes from the
hand of our Lord, and, as I said before, [18] is not anything
that I have acquired myself, because it is exceedingly
supernatural, and I think I would not barter it for all the
graces of which I shall speak further on: I do not say for all of
them together, but for any one of them separately.  And it must
not be forgotten that, as I have just said, these impetuosities
came upon me after I had received those graces from our Lord [19]
which I am speaking of now, and all those described in this book,
and it is in this state our Lord keeps me at this moment. [20]

21. In the beginning I was afraid--it happens to me to be almost
always so when our Lord leads me by a new way, until His Majesty
reassures me as I proceed--and so our Lord bade me not to fear,
but to esteem this grace more than all the others He had given
me; for the soul was purified by this pain--burnished, or refined
as gold in the crucible, so that it might be the better enamelled
with His gifts, and the dross burnt away in this life, which
would have to be burnt away in purgatory.

22. I understood perfectly that this pain was a great grace; but
I was much more certain of it now and my confessor tells me I did
well.  And though I was afraid, because I was so wicked, I never
could believe it was anything wrong: on the other hand, the
exceeding greatness of the blessing made me afraid, when I called
to mind how little I had deserved it.  Blessed be our Lord, who
is so good!  Amen.

23. I have, it seems, wandered from my subject; for I began by
speaking of raptures, and that of which I have been speaking is
even more than a rapture, and the effects of it are what I have
described.  Now let us return to raptures, and speak of their
ordinary characteristics.  I have to say that, when the rapture
was over, my body seemed frequently to be buoyant, as if all
weight had departed from it; so much so, that now and then I
scarcely knew that my feet touched the ground.  But during the
rapture itself the body is very often as if it were dead,
perfectly powerless.  It continues in the position it was in when
the rapture came upon it--if sitting, sitting; if the hands were
open, or if they were shut, they will remain open or shut. [21]
For though the senses fail but rarely, it has happened to me
occasionally to lose them wholly--seldom, however, and then only
for a short time.  But in general they are in disorder; and
though they have no power whatever to deal with outward things,
there remains the power of hearing and seeing; but it is as if
the things heard and seen were at a great distance, far away.

24. I do not say that the soul sees and hears when the rapture is
at the highest,--I mean by at the highest, when the faculties are
lost, because profoundly united with God,--for then it neither
sees, nor hears, nor perceives, as I believe; but, as I said of
the previous prayer of union, [22] this utter transformation of
the soul in God continues only for an instant; yet while it
continues no faculty of the soul is aware of it, or knows what is
passing there.  Nor can it be understood while we are living on
the earth--at least, God will not have us understand it, because
we must be incapable of understanding it.  I know it
by experience.

25. You, my father, will ask me: How comes it, then, that a
rapture occasionally lasts so many hours?  What has often
happened to me is this,--I spoke of it before, when writing of
the previous state of prayer, [23]--the rapture is not
continuous, the soul is frequently absorbed, or, to speak more
correctly, our Lord absorbs it in Himself; and when He has held
it thus for a moment, the will alone remains in union with Him.
The movements of the two other faculties seem to me to be like
those of the needle of sun-dials, which is never at rest; yet
when the Sun of Justice will have it so, He can hold it still.

26. This I speak of lasts but a moment; yet, as the impulse and
the upraising of the spirit were vehement, and though the other
faculties bestir themselves again, the will continues absorbed,
and causes this operation in the body, as if it were the absolute
mistress; for now that the two other faculties are restless, and
attempt to disturb it, it takes care--for if it is to have
enemies, the fewer the better--that the senses also shall not
trouble it: and thus it comes to pass that the senses are
suspended; for so our Lord wills it.  And for the most part the
eyes are closed, though we may not wish to close them; and if
occasionally they remain open, as I said just now, the soul
neither discerns nor considers what it sees.

27. What the body then can do here is still less in order that,
when the faculties come together again, there may not be so much
to do.  Let him, therefore, to whom our Lord has granted this
grace, be not discouraged when he finds himself in this
state--the body under constraint for many hours, the
understanding and the memory occasionally astray.  The truth is
that, in general, they are inebriated with the praises of God, or
with searching to comprehend or understand that which has passed
over them.  And yet even for this they are not thoroughly awake,
but are rather like one who has slept long, and dreamed, and is
hardly yet awake.

28. I dwell so long on this point because I know that there are
persons now, even in this place, [24] to whom our Lord is
granting these graces; and if their directors have had no
experience in the matter, they will think, perhaps, that they
must be as dead persons during the trance--and they will think so
the more if they have no learning.  It is piteous to see what
those confessors who do not understand this make people suffer.
I shall speak of it by and by. [25]  Perhaps I do not know what I
am saying.  You, my father, will understand it, if I am at all
correct; for our Lord has admitted you to the experience of it:
yet, because that experience is not very great, it may be,
perhaps, that you have not considered the matter so much as I
have done.

29. So then, though I do all I can, my body has no strength to
move for some time; the soul took it all away.  Very often, too,
he who was before sickly and full of pain remains healthy, and
even stronger; for it is something great that is given to the
soul in rapture; and sometimes, as I have said already, [26] our
Lord will have the body rejoice, because it is obedient in that
which the soul requires of it.  When we recover our
consciousness, the faculties may remain, if the rapture has been
deep, for a day or two, and even for three days, so absorbed, or
as if stunned,--so much so, as to be in appearance no
longer themselves.

30. Here comes the pain of returning to this life; here it is the
wings of the soul grew, to enable it to fly so high: the weak
feathers are fallen off.  Now the standard of Christ is raised up
aloft, which seems to be nothing else but the going up, or the
carrying up, of the Captain of the fort to the highest tower of
it, there to raise up the standard of God.  The soul, as in a
place of safety, looks down on those below; it fears no dangers
now--yea, rather, it courts them, as one assured beforehand of
victory.  It sees most clearly how lightly are the things of this
world to be esteemed, and the nothingness thereof. The soul now
seeks not, and possesses not, any other will but that of doing
our Lord's will, [27] and so it prays Him to let it be so; it
gives to Him the keys of its own will.  Lo, the gardener is now
become the commander of a fortress!  The soul will do nothing but
the will of our Lord; it will not act as the owner even of
itself, nor of anything, not even of a single apple in the
orchard; only, if there be any good thing in the garden, it is at
His Majesty's disposal; for from henceforth the soul will have
nothing of its own,--all it seeks is to do everything for His
glory, and according to His will.

31. This is really the way in which these things come to pass; if
the raptures be true raptures, the fruits and advantages spoken
of abide in the soul; but if they did not, I should have great
doubts about their being from God--yea, rather, I should be
afraid they were those frenzies of which St. Vincent speaks. [28]
I have seen it myself, and I know it by experience, that the soul
in rapture is mistress of everything, and acquires such freedom
in one hour, and even in less, as to be unable to recognize
itself.  It sees distinctly that all this does not belong to it,
neither knows it how it came to possess so great a good; but it
clearly perceives the very great blessing which every one of
these raptures always brings.  No one will believe this who has
not had experience of it, and so they do not believe the poor
soul: they saw it lately so wicked, and now they see it pretend
to things of so high an order; for it is not satisfied with
serving our Lord in the common way,--it must do so forthwith in
the highest way it can.  They consider this a temptation and a
folly; yet they would not be astonished, if they knew that it
comes not from the soul, but from our Lord, to whom it has given
up the keys of its will.

32. For my part, I believe that a soul which has reached this
state neither speaks nor acts of itself, but rather that the
supreme King takes care of all it has to do.  O my God, how clear
is the meaning of those words, and what good reason the Psalmist
had, and all the world will ever have, to pray for the wings of a
dove! [29]  It is plain that this is the flight of the spirit
rising upwards above all created things, and chiefly above
itself: but it is a sweet flight, a delicious flight--a flight
without noise.

33. Oh, what power that soul possesses which our Lord raises to
this state! how it looks down upon everything, entangled by
nothing! how ashamed it is of the time when it was entangled! how
it is amazed at its own blindness! how it pities those who are
still in darkness, especially if they are men of prayer, and have
received consolations from God!  It would like to cry out to
them, that they might be made to see the delusions they are in:
and, indeed, it does so now and then; and then a thousand
persecutions fall upon it as a shower.  People consider it
wanting in humility, and think it means to teach those from whom
it should learn, particularly if it be a woman.  Hence its
condemnation; and not without reason; because they know not how
strong the influence is that moves it.  The soul at times cannot
help itself; nor can it refrain from undeceiving those it loves,
and whom it longs to see delivered out of the prison of this
life; for that state in which the soul itself had been before
neither is, nor seems to be, anything else but a prison.

34. The soul is weary of the days during which it respected
points of honour, and the delusion which led it to believe that
to be honour which the world calls by that name; now it sees it
to be the greatest lie, and that we are all walking therein.
It understands that true honour is not delusive, but real,
esteeming that which is worthy of esteem, and despising that
which is despicable; for everything is nothing, and less than
nothing, whatever passeth away, and is not pleasing unto God.
The soul laughs at itself when it thinks of the time in which it
regarded money, and desired to possess it,--though, as to this, I
verily believe that I never had to confess such a fault; it was
fault enough to have regarded money at all.  If I could purchase
with money the blessings which I possess, I should make much of
it; but it is plain that these blessings are gained by abandoning
all things.

35. What is there that is procurable by this money which we
desire?  Is it anything of worth, and anything lasting?
Why, then, do we desire it?  A dismal resting place it provides,
which costs so dear!  Very often it obtains for us hell itself,
fire everlasting, and torments without end.  Oh, if all men would
but regard it as profitless dross, how peaceful the world would
be! how free from bargaining!  How friendly all men would be one
with another, if no regard were paid to honour and money!
I believe it would be a remedy for everything.

36. The soul sees how blind men are to the nature of
pleasure--how by means of it they provide for themselves trouble
and disquietude even in this life.  What restlessness! how little
satisfaction! what labour in vain!  It sees, too, not only the
cobwebs that cover it, and its great faults, but also the specks
of dirt, however slight they may be; for the sun shines most
clearly; and thus, however much the soul may have laboured at its
own perfection, it sees itself to be very unclean, if the rays of
the sun fall really upon it.  The soul is like water in a vessel,
which appears pellucid when the sun does not shine through it;
but if it does, the water then is found to be full of motes.

37. This comparison is literally correct.  Before the soul fell
into the trance, it thought itself to be careful about not
offending God, and that it did what it could in proportion to its
strength; but now that it has attained to this state, in which
the Sun of Justice shines upon it, and makes it open its eyes, it
beholds so many motes, that it would gladly close them again.
It is not so truly the child of the noble eagle, that it can gaze
upon the sun; but, for the few instants it can keep them open, it
beholds itself wholly unclean.  It remembers the words: "Who
shall be just in Thy presence?" [30]  When it looks on this
Divine Sun, the brightness thereof dazzles it,--when it looks on
itself, its eyes are blinded by the dust: the little dove is
blind.  So it happens very often: the soul is utterly blinded,
absorbed, amazed, dizzy at the vision of so much grandeur.

38. It is in rapture that true humility is acquired--humility
that will never say any good of self, nor suffer others to do so.
The Lord of the garden, not the soul, distributes the fruit
thereof, and so none remains in its hands; all the good it has,
it refers to God; if it says anything about itself, it is for His
glory.  It knows that it possesses nothing here; and even if it
wished, it cannot continue ignorant of that.  It sees this, as it
were, with the naked eye; for, whether it will or not, its eyes
are shut against the things of this world, and open to see
the truth.

raptus superior est præcedentibus orationis gradibus, etiam
oratione unionis ordinariæ, et habet effectus multo

2. "She says that rapture is more excellent than union; that is,
that the soul in a rapture has a greater fruition of God, and
that God takes it then more into His own hands.  That is
evidently so; because in a rapture the soul loses the use of its
exterior and interior faculties.  When she says that union is the
beginning, middle, and end, she means that pure union is almost
always uniform; but that there are degrees in rapture, of which
some are, as it were, the beginning, some the middle, others the
end.  That is the reason why it is called by different names;
some of which denote the least, others the most, perfect form of
it, as it will appear hereafter."--Note in the Spanish edition of

Chapter XXI.


Conclusion of the Subject.  Pain of the Awakening.
Light Against Delusions.


1. To bring this matter to an end, I say that it is not necessary
for the soul to give its consent here; it is already given: the
soul knows that it has given up its will into His hands, [1] and
that it cannot deceive Him, because He knoweth all things.  It is
not here as it is in the world, where all life is full of deceit
and double-dealing.  When you think you have gained one man's
good will, because of the outward show he makes, you afterwards
learn that all was a lie.  No one can live in the midst of so
much scheming, particularly if there be any interests at stake.

2. Blessed, then, is that soul which our Lord draws on to the
understanding of the truth!  Oh, what a state for kings!
How much better it would be for them if they strove for this,
rather than for great dominions!  How justice would prevail under
their rule!  What evils would be prevented, and might have been
prevented already!  Here no man fears to lose life or honour for
the love of God.  What a grand thing this would be to him who is
more bound than those beneath him to regard the honour of our
Lord!--for it is kings whom the crowd must follow.  To make one
step in the propagation of the faith, and to give one ray of
light to heretics, I would forfeit a thousand kingdoms.  And with
good reason: for it is another thing altogether to gain a kingdom
that shall never end, because one drop of the water of that
kingdom, if the soul but tastes it, renders the things of this
world utterly loathsome.

3. If, then, the soul should be wholly engulfed, what then?
O Lord, if Thou wert to give me the right to publish this abroad,
people would not believe me--as they do not believe many who are
able to speak of it in a way very different from mine; but I
should satisfy myself, at least.  I believe I should count my
life as nothing, if I might make others understand but one of
these truths.  I know not what I shall do afterwards, for I
cannot trust myself; though I am what I am, I have a violent
desire, which is wasting me, to say this to those who are in
authority.  And now that I can do no more, I betake myself to
Thee, O my Lord, to implore a remedy for all.  Thou knowest well
that I would gladly divest myself of all the graces which Thou
hast given me,--provided I remained in a condition never to
offend Thee,--and give them up to those who are kings; for I know
it would then be impossible for them to allow what they allow
now, or fail to receive the very greatest blessings.

4. O my God, make kings to understand how far their obligations
reach!  Thou hast been pleased to distinguish them on earth in
such a way that--so I have heard--Thou showest signs in the
heavens when Thou takest any of them away.  Certainly, when I
think of this, my devotion is stirred, because Thou wilt have
them learn, O my King, even from this, that they must imitate
Thee in their lives, seeing that, when they die, signs are
visible in the heavens, as it was when Thou wert dying Thyself.

5. I am very bold; if it be wrong, you, my father, will tear this
out: only believe that I should speak much more to the purpose in
the presence of kings,--if I might, or thought they would listen
to me,--for I recommend them greatly to God, and I wish I might
be of service to them.  All this makes one risk life; for I long
frequently to lose mine,--and that would be to lose a little for
the chance of gaining much; for surely it is not possible to
live, when we see with our eyes the great delusion wherein we are
walking, and the blindness in which we are living.

6. A soul that has attained to this is not limited to the desires
it has to serve God; for His Majesty gives it strength to bring
those desires to good effect.  Nothing can be put before it into
which it will not throw itself, if only it thinks that God may be
served thereby: and yet it is doing nothing, because, as I said
before, [2] it sees clearly that all is nothing, except pleasing
God.  The trial is, that those who are so worthless as I am, have
no trial of the kind.  May it be Thy good pleasure, O my God,
that the time may come in which I may be able to pay one farthing
at least, of the heavy debt I owe Thee!  Do Thou, O Lord, so
dispose matters according to Thy will, that this Thy servant may
do Thee some service.  Other women there have been who did heroic
deeds for Thee; I am good only to talk; and so it has not been
Thy pleasure, O my God, that I should do any thing: all ends in
talk and desires--that is all my service.  And yet even in this I
am not free, because it is possible I might fail altogether.

7. Strengthen Thou my soul, and prepare it, O Good of all good;
and, my Jesus, then ordain Thou the means whereby I may do
something for Thee, so that there may be not even one who can
bear to receive so much, and make no payment in return.  Cost
what it may, O Lord, let me not come before Thee with hands so
empty, [3] seeing that the reward of every one will be according
to his works. [4]  Behold my life, behold my good name and my
will; I have given them all to Thee; I am Thine: dispose of me
according to Thy will.  I see well enough, O Lord, how little I
can do; but now, having drawn near to Thee,--having ascended to
this watchtower, from which the truth may be seen,--and while
Thou departest not from me, I can do all things; but if Thou
departest from me, were it but for a moment, I shall go thither
where I was once--that is, to hell. [5]

8. Oh, what it is for a soul in this state to have to return to
the commerce of the world, to see and look on the farce of this
life, [6] so ill-ordered; to waste its time in attending to the
body by sleeping and eating! [7]  All is wearisome; it cannot run
away,--it sees itself chained and imprisoned; it feels then most
keenly the captivity into which the body has brought us, and the
wretchedness of this life.  It understands the reason why
St. Paul prayed to God to deliver him from it. [8]  The soul
cries with the Apostle, and calls upon God to deliver it, as I
said on another occasion. [9]  But here it often cries with so
much violence, that it seems as if it would go out of the body in
search of its freedom, now that they do not take it away.  It is
as a slave sold into a strange land; and what distresses it most
is, that it cannot find many who make the same complaint and the
same prayer: the desire of life is more common.

9. Oh, if we were utterly detached,--if we never placed our
happiness in anything of this world,--how the pain, caused by
living always away from God, would temper the fear of death with
the desire of enjoying the true life!  Sometimes I consider, if a
person like myself--because our Lord has given this light to me,
whose love is so cold, and whose true rest is so uncertain, for I
have not deserved it by my works--frequently feels her banishment
so much, what the feelings of the Saints must have been.
What must St. Paul and the Magdalene, and others like them, have
suffered, in whom the fire of the love of God has grown so
strong?  Their life must have been a continual martyrdom.
It seems to me that they who bring me any comfort, and whose
conversation is any relief, are those persons in whom I find
these desires--I mean, desires with acts.  I say with acts, for
there are people who think themselves detached, and who say so of
themselves,--and it must be so, for their vocation demands it, as
well as the many years that are passed since some of them began
to walk in the way of perfection,--but my soul distinguishes
clearly, and afar off, between those who are detached in words,
and those who make good those words by deeds.  The little
progress of the former, and the great progress of the latter,
make it plain.  This is a matter which a person of any experience
can see into most clearly.

10. So far, then, of the effects of those raptures which come
from the Spirit of God.  The truth is, that these are greater or
less.  I say less, because in the beginning, though the effects
are wrought, they are not tested by works, and so it cannot be
clear that a person has them; and perfection, too, is a thing of
growth, and of labouring after freedom from the cobwebs of
memory; and this requires some time.  Meanwhile, the greater the
growth of love and humility in the soul, the stronger the perfume
of the flowers of virtues is for itself and for others. The truth
is, that our Lord can so work in the soul in an instant during
these raptures, that but little remains for the soul to do in
order to attain to perfection.  No one, who has not had
experience of it, will ever be able to believe what our Lord now
bestows on the soul.  No effort of ours--so I think--can ever
reach so far.

11. However, I do not mean to say that those persons who during
many years make use of the method prescribed by writers on
prayer,--who discuss the principles thereof, and the means
whereby it may be acquired,--will not, by the help of our Lord,
attain to perfection and great detachment with much labour; but
they will not attain to it so rapidly as by the way of raptures,
in which our Lord works independently of us, draws the soul
utterly away from earth, and gives it dominion over all things
here below, though the merits of that soul may not be greater
than mine were: I cannot use stronger language, for my merits are
as nothing.  Why His Majesty doeth this is, because it is His
pleasure, and He doeth it according to His pleasure; even if the
soul be without the fitting disposition, He disposes it for the
reception of that blessing which He is giving to it.  Although it
be most certain that He never fails to comfort those who do well,
and strive to be detached, still He does not always give these
effects because they have deserved them at His hands by
cultivating the garden, but because it is His will to show His
greatness at times in a soil which is most worthless, as I have
just said, and to prepare it for all good: and all this in such a
way that it seems as if the soul was now, in a manner, unable to
go back and live in sin against God, as it did before.

12. The mind is now so inured to the comprehension of that which
is truth indeed, that everything else seems to it to be but
child's play.  It laughs to itself, at times, when it sees grave
men--men given to prayer, men of religion--make much of points of
honour, which itself is trampling beneath its feet.  They say
that discretion, and the dignity of their callings, require it of
them as a means to do more good; but that soul knows perfectly
well that they would do more good in one day by preferring the
love of God to this their dignity, than they will do in ten years
by considering it.

13. The life of this soul is a life of trouble: the cross is
always there, but the progress it makes is great.  When those who
have to do with it think it has arrived at the summit of
perfection, within a little while they see it much more advanced;
for God is ever giving it grace upon grace.  God is the soul of
that soul now; it is He who has the charge of it; and so He
enlightens it; for He seems to be watching over it, always
attentive to it, that it may not offend Him,--giving it grace,
and stirring it up in His service.  When my soul reached this
state, in which God showed me mercy so great, my wretchedness
came to an end, and our Lord gave me strength to rise above it.
The former occasions of sin, as well as the persons with whom I
was accustomed to distract myself, did me no more harm than if
they had never existed; on the contrary, that which ordinarily
did me harm, helped me on.  Everything contributed to make me
know God more, and to love Him; to make me see how much I owed
Him, as well as to be sorry for being what I had been.

14. I saw clearly that this did not come from myself, that I had
not brought it about by any efforts of my own, and that there was
not time enough for it.  His Majesty, of His mere goodness, had
given me strength for it.  From the time our Lord began to give
me the grace of raptures, until now, this strength has gone on
increasing.  He, of His goodness, hath held me by the hand, that
I might not go back.  I do not think that I am doing anything
myself--certainly I do not; for I see distinctly that all this is
the work of our Lord.  For this reason, it seems to me that the
soul in which our Lord worketh these graces,--if it walks in
humility and fear, always acknowledging the work of our Lord, and
that we ourselves can do, as it were, nothing,--may be thrown
among any companions, and, however distracted and wicked these
may be, will neither be hurt nor disturbed in any way; on the
contrary, as I have just said, that will help it on, and be a
means unto it whereby it may derive much greater profit.

15. Those souls are strong which are chosen by our Lord to do
good to others; still, this their strength is not their own.
When our Lord brings a soul on to this state, He communicates to
it of His greatest secrets by degrees.  True revelations--the
great gifts and visions--come by ecstasies, all tending to make
the soul humble and strong, to make it despise the things of this
world, and have a clearer knowledge of the greatness of the
reward which our Lord has prepared for those who serve Him. [10]

16. May it please His Majesty that the great munificence with
which He hath dealt with me, miserable sinner that I am, may have
some weight with those who shall read this, so that they may be
strong and courageous enough to give up everything utterly for
God.  If His Majesty repays us so abundantly, that even in this
life the reward and gain of those who serve Him become visible,
what will it be in the next?

The Security of Contemplatives Lies in Their Not Ascending to
High Things if Our Lord Does Not Raise Them.  The Sacred Humanity
Must Be the Road to the Highest Contemplation.  A Delusion in
Which the Saint Was Once Entangled.


1. There is one thing I should like to say--I think it important:
and if you, my father, approve, it will serve for a lesson that
possibly may be necessary; for in some books on prayer the
writers say that the soul, though it cannot in its own strength
attain to this state,--because it is altogether a supernatural
work wrought in it by our Lord,--may nevertheless succeed, by
lifting up the spirit above all created things, and raising it
upwards in humility, after some years spent in a purgative life,
and advancing in the illuminative.  I do not very well know what
they mean by illuminative: I understand it to mean the life of
those who are making progress.  And they advise us much to
withdraw from all bodily imagination, and draw near to the
contemplation of the Divinity; for they say that those who have
advanced so far would be embarrassed or hindered in their way to
the highest contemplation, if they regarded even the Sacred
Humanity itself. [1]  They defend their opinion [2] by bringing
forward the words [3] of our Lord to the Apostles, concerning the
coming of the Holy Ghost; I mean that Coming which was after the
Ascension.  If the Apostles had believed, as they believed after
the Coming of the Holy Ghost, that He is both God and Man, His
bodily Presence would, in my opinion, have been no hindrance; for
those words were not said to the Mother of God, though she loved
Him more than all. [4]  They think that, as this work of
contemplation is wholly spiritual, any bodily object whatever can
disturb or hinder it.  They say that the contemplative should
regard himself as being within a definite space, God everywhere
around, and himself absorbed in Him.  This is what we should
aim at.

2. This seems to me right enough now and then; but to withdraw
altogether from Christ, and to compare His divine Body with our
miseries or with any created thing whatever, is what I cannot
endure.  May God help me to explain myself!  I am not
contradicting them on this point, for they are learned and
spiritual persons, understanding what they say: God, too, is
guiding souls by many ways and methods, as He has guided mine.
It is of my own soul that I wish to speak now,--I do not
intermeddle with others,--and of the danger I was in because I
would comply with the directions I was reading.  I can well
believe that he who has attained to union, and advances no
further,--that is, to raptures, visions, and other graces of God
given to souls,--will consider that opinion to be best, as I did
myself: and if I had continued in it, I believe I should never
have reached the state I am in now.  I hold it to be a delusion:
still, it may be that it is I who am deluded.  But I will tell
you what happened to me.

3. As I had no director, I used to read these books, where, by
little and little, I thought I might understand something.
I found out afterwards that, if our Lord had not shown me the
way, I should have learned but little from books; for I
understood really nothing till His Majesty made me learn by
experience: neither did I know what I was doing.  So, in the
beginning, when I attained to some degree of supernatural
prayer,--I speak of the prayer of quiet,--I laboured to remove
from myself every thought of bodily objects; but I did not dare
to lift up my soul, for that I saw would be presumption in me,
who was always so wicked. I thought, however, that I had a sense
of the presence of God: this was true, and I contrived to be in a
state of recollection before Him.  This method of prayer is full
of sweetness, if God helps us in it, and the joy of it is great.
And so, because I was conscious of the profit and delight which
this way furnished me, no one could have brought me back to the
contemplation of the Sacred Humanity; for that seemed to me to be
a real hindrance to prayer.

4. O Lord of my soul, and my Good!  Jesus Christ crucified!
I never think of this opinion, which I then held, without pain; I
believe it was an act of high treason, though done in ignorance.
Hitherto, I had been all my life long so devout to the Sacred
Humanity--for this happened but lately; I mean by lately, that it
was before our Lord gave me the grace of raptures and visions.
I did not continue long of this opinion, [5] and so I returned to
my habit of delighting in our Lord, particularly at Communion.
I wish I could have His picture and image always before my eyes,
since I cannot have Him graven in my soul as deeply as I wish.

5. Is it possible, O my Lord, that I could have had the thought,
if only for an hour, that Thou couldst be a hindrance to my
greatest good?  Whence are all my blessings? are they not from
Thee?  I will not think that I was blamable, for I was very sorry
for it, and it was certainly done in ignorance.  And so it
pleased Thee, in Thy goodness, to succour me, by sending me one
who has delivered me from this delusion; and afterwards by
showing Thyself to me so many times, as I shall relate
hereafter, [6] that I might clearly perceive how great my
delusion was, and also tell it to many persons; which I have
done, as well as describe it as I am doing now.  I believe myself
that this is the reason why so many souls, after advancing to the
prayer of union, make no further progress, and do not attain to
very great liberty of spirit.

6. It seems to me, that there are two considerations on which I
may ground this opinion.  Perhaps I am saying nothing to the
purpose, yet what I say is the result of experience; for my soul
was in a very evil plight, till our Lord enlightened it: all its
joys were but sips; and when it had come forth therefrom, it
never found itself in that company which afterwards it had in
trials and temptations.

7. The first consideration is this: there is a little absence of
humility--so secret and so hidden, that we do not observe it.
Who is there so proud and wretched as I, that, even after
labouring all his life in penances and prayers and persecutions,
can possibly imagine himself not to be exceedingly rich, most
abundantly rewarded, when our Lord permits him to stand with
St. John at the foot of the cross?  I know not into whose head it
could have entered to be not satisfied with this, unless it be
mine, which has gone wrong in every way where it should have gone
right onwards.

8. Then, if our constitution--or perhaps sickness--will not
permit us always to think of His Passion, because it is so
painful, who is to hinder us from thinking of Him risen from the
grave, seeing that we have Him so near us in the Sacrament, where
he is glorified, and where we shall not see Him in His great
weariness--scourged, streaming with blood, faint by the way,
persecuted by those to whom He had done good, and not believed in
by the Apostles?  Certainly it is not always that one can bear to
meditate on sufferings so great as were those He underwent.
Behold Him here, before His ascension into heaven, without pain,
all-glorious, giving strength to some and courage to others.
In the most Holy Sacrament, He is our companion, as if it was not
in His power to withdraw Himself for a moment from us.  And yet
it was in my power to withdraw from Thee, O my Lord, that I might
serve Thee better!  It may be that I knew Thee not when I sinned
against Thee; but how could I, having once known Thee, ever think
I should gain more in this way?  O Lord, what an evil way I took!
and I was going out of the way, if Thou hadst not brought me back
to it.  When I see Thee near me, I see all good things together.
No trial befalls me that is not easy to bear, when I think of
Thee standing before those who judged Thee.

9. With so good a Friend and Captain ever present, Himself the
first to suffer, everything can be borne.  He helps, He
strengthens, He never fails, He is the true Friend.  I see
clearly, and since then have always seen, that if we are to
please God, and if He is to give us His great graces, everything
must pass through the hands of His most Sacred Humanity, in whom
His Majesty said that He is well pleased. [7]  I know this by
repeated experience: our Lord has told it me.  I have seen
clearly that this is the door [8] by which we are to enter, if we
would have His supreme Majesty reveal to us His great secrets.

10. So, then, I would have your reverence seek no other way, even
if you were arrived at the highest contemplation.  This way is
safe.  Our Lord is He by whom all good things come to us; He will
teach you.  Consider His life; that is the best example. What
more can we want than so good a Friend at our side, who will not
forsake us when we are in trouble and distress, as they do who
belong to this world!  Blessed is he who truly loves Him, and who
always has Him near him!  Let us consider the glorious St. Paul,
who seems as if Jesus was never absent from his lips, as if he
had Him deep down in his heart.  After I had heard this of some
great Saints given to contemplation, I considered the matter
carefully; and I see that they walked in no other way.
St. Francis with the stigmata proves it, St. Antony of Padua with
the Infant Jesus; St. Bernard rejoiced in the Sacred Humanity; so
did St. Catherine of Siena, and many others, as your reverence
knows better than I do.

11. This withdrawing from bodily objects must no doubt be good,
seeing that it is recommended by persons who are so spiritual;
but, in my opinion, it ought to be done only when the soul has
made very great progress; for until then it is clear that the
Creator must be sought for through His creatures.  All this
depends on the grace which our Lord distributes to every soul.
I do not intermeddle here.  What I would say is, that the most
Sacred Humanity of Christ is not to be counted among the objects
from which we have to withdraw.  Let this be clearly understood.
I wish I knew how to explain it. [9]

12. When God suspends all the powers of the soul,--as we see He
does in the states of prayer already described,--it is clear
that, whether we wish it or not, this presence is withdrawn.
Be it so, then.  The loss is a blessed one, because it takes
place in order that we may have a deeper fruition of what we seem
to have lost; for at that moment the whole soul is occupied in
loving Him whom the understanding has toiled to know; and it
loves what it has not comprehended, and rejoices in what it could
not have rejoiced in so well, if it had not lost itself, in
order, as I am saying, to gain itself the more.  But that we
should carefully and laboriously accustom ourselves not to strive
with all our might to have always--and please God it be
always!--the most Sacred Humanity before our eyes,--this, I say,
is what seems to me not to be right: it is making the soul, as
they say, to walk in the air; for it has nothing to rest on, how
full soever of God it may think itself to be.

13. It is a great matter for us to have our Lord before us as Man
while we are living and in the flesh.  This is that other
inconvenience which I say must be met with.  The first--I have
already begun to describe it--is a little failure in humility, in
that the soul desires to rise of itself before our Lord raises
it, and is not satisfied with meditation on so excellent a
subject,--seeking to be Mary before it has laboured with Martha.
If our Lord will have a soul to be Mary, even on the first day,
there is nothing to be afraid of; but we must not be self-invited
guests, as I think I said on another occasion. [10]  This little
mote of want of humility, though in appearance a mere nothing,
does a great deal of harm to those who wish to advance
in contemplation.

14. I now come back to the second consideration.  We are not
angels, for we have a body; to seek to make ourselves angels
while we are on the earth, and so much on the earth as I was, is
an act of folly.  In general, our thoughts must have something to
rest on, though the soul may go forth out of itself now and then,
or it may be very often so full of God as to be in need of no
created thing by the help of which it may recollect itself.
But this is not so common a case; for when we have many things to
do, when we are persecuted and in trouble, when we cannot have
much rest, and when we have our seasons of dryness, Christ is our
best Friend; for we regard Him as Man, and behold Him faint and
in trouble, and He is our Companion; and when we shall have
accustomed ourselves in this way, it is very easy to find Him
near us, although there will be occasions from time to time when
we can do neither the one nor the other.

15. For this end, that is useful which I spoke of before: [11] we
must not show ourselves as labouring after spiritual
consolations; come what may, to embrace the cross is the great
thing.  The Lord of all consolation was Himself forsaken: they
left Him alone in His sorrows.  Do not let us forsake Him; for
His hand will help us to rise more than any efforts we can make;
and He will withdraw Himself when He sees it be expedient for us,
and when He pleaseth will also draw the soul forth out of itself,
as I said before. [12]

16. God is greatly pleased when He beholds a soul in its humility
making His Son a Mediator between itself and Him, and yet loving
Him so much as to confess its own unworthiness, even when He
would raise it up to the highest contemplation, and saying with
St. Peter: [13] "Go Thou away from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful
man."  I know this by experience: it was thus that God directed
my soul.  Others may walk, as I said before, [14] by another and
a shorter road.  What I have understood of the matter is this:
that the whole foundation of prayer must be laid in humility, and
that the more a soul humbles itself in prayer, the more God lifts
it up.  I do not remember that He ever showed me any of those
marvellous mercies, of which I shall speak hereafter, [15] at any
other time than when I was as one brought to nothing, [16] by
seeing how wicked I was.  Moreover, His Majesty contrived to make
me understand matters that helped me to know myself, but which I
could never have even imagined of myself.

17. I believe myself that if a soul makes any efforts of its own
to further itself in the way of the prayer of union, and though
it may seem to make immediate progress, it will quickly fall
back, because the foundations were not duly laid.  I fear, too,
that such a soul will never attain to true poverty of spirit,
which consists in seeking consolation or sweetness, not in
prayer,--the consolations of the earth are already
abandoned,--but rather in sorrows, for the love of Him who always
lived in sorrows Himself; [17] and in being calm in the midst of
sorrows and aridities.  Though the soul may feel it in some
measure, there is no disquiet, nor any of that pain which some
persons suffer, who, if they are not always labouring with the
understanding and with a sense of devotion, think everything
lost,--as if their efforts merited so great a blessing!

18. I am not saying that men should not seek to be devout, nor
that they should not stand with great reverence in the presence
of God, but only that they are not to vex themselves if they
cannot find even one good thought, as I said in another
place; [18] for we are unprofitable servants. [19]  What do we
think we can do?  Our Lord grant that we understand this, and
that we may be those little asses who drive the windlass I spoke
of: [20] these, though their eyes are bandaged, and they do not
understand what they are doing, yet draw up more water than the
gardener can draw with all his efforts.  We must walk in liberty
on this road, committing ourselves into the hands of God.  If it
be His Majesty's good pleasure to raise us and place us among His
chamberlains and secret councillors, we must go willingly; if
not, we must serve Him in the lower offices of His house, and not
sit down on the upper seats. [21]  As I have sometimes said, [22]
God is more careful of us than we are ourselves, and knows what
each one of us is fit for.

19. What use is there in governing oneself by oneself, when the
whole will has been given up to God? I think this less endurable
now than in the first state of prayer, and it does much greater
harm; for these blessings are supernatural.  If a man has a bad
voice, let him force himself ever so much to sing, he will never
improve it; but if God gives him a good voice, he has no need to
try it twice.  Let us, then, pray Him always to show His mercy
upon us, with a submissive spirit, yet trusting in the goodness
of God.  And now that the soul is permitted to sit at the feet of
Christ, let it contrive not to quit its place, but keep it
anyhow.  Let it follow the example of the Magdalene; and when it
shall be strong enough, God will lead it into
the wilderness. [23]

20. You, then, my father, must be content with this until you
meet with some one of more experience and better knowledge than I
am.  If you see people who are beginning to taste of God, do not
trust them if they think that they advance more, and have a
deeper fruition of God, when they make efforts of their own.
Oh, when God wills it, how He discovers Himself without these
little efforts of ours!  We may do what we like, but He throws
the spirit into a trance as easily as a giant takes up a straw;
no resistance is possible.  What a thing to believe, that God
will wait till the toad shall fly of itself, when He has already
willed it should do so!  Well, it seems to me still more
difficult and hard for our spirit to rise upwards, if God does
not raise it, seeing that it is burdened with earth, and hindered
in a thousand ways.  Its willingness to rise is of no service to
it; for, though an aptness for flying be more natural to it than
to a toad, yet is it so sunk in the mire as to have lost it by
its own fault.

21. I come, then, to this conclusion: whenever we think of
Christ, we should remind ourselves of the love that made Him
bestow so many graces upon us, and also how great that love is
which our Lord God has shown us, in giving us such a pledge of
the love He bears us; for love draws forth love.  And though we
are only at the very beginning, and exceedingly wicked, yet let
us always labour to keep this in view, and stir ourselves up to
love; for if once our Lord grants us this grace, of having this
love imprinted in our hearts, everything will be easy, and we
shall do great things in a very short time, and with very little
labour.  May His Majesty give us that love,--He knows the great
need we have of it,--for the sake of that love which He bore us,
and of His glorious Son, to whom it cost so much to make it known
to us!  Amen.

22. There is one thing I should like to ask you, my father.
How is it that, when our Lord begins to bestow upon a soul a
grace so great as this of perfect contemplation, it is not, as it
ought to be, perfect at once?  Certainly, it seems it should be
so; for he who receives a grace so great ought never more to seek
consolations on earth.  How is it, I ask, that a soul which has
ecstasies and so far is more accustomed to receive graces, should
yet seem to bring forth fruits still higher and higher,--and the
more so, the more it is detached,--when our Lord might have
sanctified it at once, the moment He came near it?  How is it, I
ask again, that the same Lord brings it to the perfection of
virtue only in the course of time?  I should be glad to learn the
reason, for I know it not.  I do know, however, that in the
beginning, when a trance lasts only the twinkling of an eye, and
is almost imperceptible but for the effects it produces, the
degree of strength which God then gives is very different from
that which He gives when this grace is a trance of
longer duration.

23. Very often, when thinking of this, have I imagined the reason
might be, that the soul does not despise itself all at once, till
our Lord instructs it by degrees, and makes it resolute, and
gives it the strength of manhood, so that it may trample utterly
upon everything.  He gave this strength to the Magdalene in a
moment.  He gives the same grace to others, according to the
measure of their abandonment of themselves into the hands of His
Majesty, that He may do with them as He will. We never thoroughly
believe that God rewards a hundredfold even in this life. [24]

24. I also thought of this comparison: supposing grace given to
those who are far advanced to be the same with that given to
those who are but beginners, we may then liken it to a certain
food of which many persons partake: they who eat a little retain
the savour of it for a moment, they who eat more are nourished by
it, but those who eat much receive life and strength.  Now, the
soul may eat so frequently and so abundantly of this food of life
as to have no pleasure in eating any other food, because it sees
how much good it derives from it.  Its taste is now so formed
upon it, that it would rather not live than have to eat any other
food; for all food but this has no other effect than to take away
the sweet savour which this good food leaves behind.

25. Further, the conversation of good people does not profit us
in one day as much as it does in many; and we may converse with
them long enough to become like them, by the grace of God.
In short, the whole matter is as His Majesty wills.  He gives His
grace to whom He pleases; but much depends on this: he who begins
to receive this grace must make a firm resolution to detach
himself from all things, and esteem this grace according
to reason.

26. It seems also to me as if His Majesty were going about to try
those who love Him,--now one, now another,--revealing Himself in
supreme joy, so as to quicken our belief, if it should be dead,
in what He will give us, saying, Behold! this is but a drop of
the immense sea of blessings; for He leaves nothing undone for
those He loves; and as He sees them receive it, so He gives, and
He gives Himself.  He loves those who love Him.  Oh, how dear He
is!--how good a Friend!  O my soul's Lord, who can find words to
describe what Thou givest to those who trust in Thee, and what
they lose who come to this state, and yet dwell in themselves!
Oh, let not this be so, O my Lord! for Thou doest more than this
when Thou comest to a lodging so mean as mine.  Blessed be Thou
for ever and ever!

27. I now humbly ask you, my father, if you mean to discuss what
I have written on prayer with spiritual persons, to see that they
are so really; for if they be persons who know only one way, or
who have stood still midway, they will not be able to understand
the matter.  There are also some whom God leads at once by the
highest way; these think that others might advance in the same
manner--quiet the understanding, and make bodily objects none of
their means; but these people will remain dry as a stick.
Others, also, there are who, having for a moment attained to the
prayer of quiet, think forthwith that, as they have had the one,
so they may have the other.  These instead of advancing, go back,
as I said before. [25]  So, throughout, experience and discretion
are necessary.  May our Lord, of His goodness, bestow them on us!

Chapter XXIII.


The Saint Resumes the History of Her Life.  Aiming at Perfection.
Means Whereby It May Be Gained.  Instructions for Confessors.


1. I shall now return to that point in my life where I broke
off, [1] having made, I believe, a longer digression than I need
have made, in order that what is still to come may be more
clearly understood.  Henceforth, it is another and a new book,--I
mean, another and a new life.  Hitherto, my life was my own; my
life, since I began to explain these methods of prayer, is the
life which God lived in me,--so it seems to me; for I feel it to
be impossible that I should have escaped in so short a time from
ways and works that were so wicked.  May our Lord be praised, who
has delivered me from myself!

2. When, then, I began to avoid the occasions of sin, and to give
myself more unto prayer, our Lord also began to bestow His graces
upon me, as one who desired, so it seemed, that I too should be
willing to receive them.  His Majesty began to give me most
frequently the grace of the prayer of quiet, and very often that
of union, which lasted some time.  But as, in these days, women
have fallen into great delusions and deceits of Satan, [2] I
began to be afraid, because the joy and sweetness which I felt
were so great, and very often beyond my power to avoid.  On the
other hand, I felt in myself a very deep conviction that God was
with me, especially when I was in prayer.  I saw, too, that I
grew better and stronger thereby.

3. But if I was a little distracted, I began to be afraid, and to
imagine that perhaps it was Satan that suspended my
understanding, making me think it to be good, in order to
withdraw me from mental prayer, hinder my meditation on the
Passion, and debar me the use of my understanding: this seemed to
me, who did not comprehend the matter, to be a grievous loss but,
as His Majesty was pleased to give me light to offend Him no
more, and to understand how much I owed Him, this fear so grew
upon me, that it made me seek diligently for spiritual persons
with whom I might treat of my state.  I had already heard of
some; for the Fathers of the Society of Jesus had come
hither; [3] and I, though I knew none of them, was greatly
attracted by them, merely because I had heard of their way of
life and of prayer; but I did not think myself fit to speak to
them, or strong enough to obey them; and this made me still more
afraid; for to converse with them, and remain what I was, seemed
to me somewhat rude.

4. I spent some time in this state, till, after much inward
contention and fear, I determined to confer with some spiritual
person, to ask him to tell me what that method of prayer was
which I was using, and to show me whether I was in error.  I was
also resolved to do everything I could not to offend God; for the
want of courage of which I was conscious, as I said before, [4]
made me so timid.  Was there ever delusion so great as mine, O my
God, when I withdrew from good in order to become good!
The devil must lay much stress on this in the beginning of a
course of virtue; for I could not overcome my repugnance.
He knows that the whole relief of the soul consists in conferring
with the friends of God.  Hence it was that no time was fixed in
which I should resolve to do this.  I waited to grow better
first, as I did before when I ceased to pray, [5]--and perhaps I
never should have become better; for I had now sunk so deeply
into the petty ways of an evil habit,--I could not convince
myself that they were wrong,--that I needed the help of others,
who should hold out a hand to raise me up.  Blessed be Thou, O
Lord!--for the first hand outstretched to me was Thine.

5. When I saw that my fear was going so far, it struck
me--because I was making progress in prayer--that this must be a
great blessing, or a very great evil; for I understood perfectly
that what had happened was something supernatural, because at
times I was unable to withstand it; to have it when I would was
also impossible.  I thought to myself that there was no help for
it, but in keeping my conscience pure, avoiding every occasion
even of venial sins; for if it was the work of the Spirit of God,
the gain was clear; and if the work of Satan, so long as I strove
to please, and did not offend, our Lord, Satan could do me little
harm; on the contrary, he must lose in the struggle.
Determined on this course, and always praying God to help me,
striving also after purity of conscience for some days, I saw
that my soul had not strength to go forth alone to a perfection
so great.  I had certain attachments to trifles, which, though
not very wrong in themselves, were yet enough to ruin all.

6. I was told of a learned ecclesiastic, [6] dwelling in this
city, whose goodness and pious life our Lord was beginning to
make known to the world.  I contrived to make his acquaintance
through a saintly nobleman [7] living in the same place.
This latter is a married man; but his life is so edifying and
virtuous, so given to prayer, and so full of charity, that the
goodness and perfection of it shine forth in all he does: and
most justly so; for many souls have been greatly blessed through
him, because of his great gifts, which, though his condition of a
layman be a hindrance to him, never lie idle.  He is a man of
great sense, and very gentle with all people; his conversation is
never wearisome, but so sweet and gracious, as well as upright
and holy, that he pleases everybody very much with whom he has
any relations.  He directs it all to the great good of those
souls with whom he converses and he seems to have no other end in
view but to do all he may be permitted to do for all men, and
make them content.

7. This blessed and holy man, then, seems to me, by the pains he
took, to have been the beginning of salvation to my soul.
His humility in his relations with me makes me wonder; for he had
spent, I believe, nearly forty years in prayer,--it may be two or
three years less,--and all his life was ordered with that
perfection which his state admitted.  His wife is so great a
servant of God, and so full of charity, that nothing is lost to
him on her account, [8]--in short, she was the chosen wife of one
who God knew would serve Him so well.  Some of their kindred are
married to some of mine.  Besides, I had also much communication
with another great servant of God, married to one of my
first cousins.

8. It was thus I contrived that the ecclesiastic I speak of, who
was so great a servant of God, and his great friend, should come
to speak to me, intending to confess to him, and to take him for
my director.  When he had brought him to speak to me, I, in the
greatest confusion at finding myself in the presence of so holy a
man, revealed to him the state of my soul, and my way of prayer.
He would not be my confessor; he said that he was very much
occupied: and so, indeed, he was.  He began with a holy
resolution to direct me as if I was strong,--I ought to have been
strong, according to the method of prayer which he saw I
used,--so that I should in nothing offend God.  When I saw that
he was resolved to make me break off at once with the petty ways
I spoke of before, [9] and that I had not the courage to go forth
at once in the perfection he required of me, I was distressed;
and when I perceived that he ordered the affairs of my soul as if
I ought to be perfect at once, I saw that much more care was
necessary in my case.  In a word, I felt that the means he would
have employed were not those by which my soul could be helped
onwards; for they were fitted for a soul more perfect than mine;
and though the graces I had received from God were very many, I
was still at the very beginning in the matter of virtue and
of mortification.

9. I believe certainly, if I had only had this ecclesiastic to
confer with, that my soul would have made no progress; for the
pain it gave me to see that I was not doing--and, as I thought,
could not do--what he told me, was enough to destroy all hope,
and make me abandon the matter altogether.  I wonder at times how
it was that he, being one who had a particular grace for the
direction of beginners in the way of God, was not permitted to
understand my case, or to undertake the care of my soul.  I see
it was all for my greater good, in order that I might know and
converse with persons so holy as the members of the Society
of Jesus.

10. After this, I arranged with that saintly nobleman that he
should come and see me now and then.  It shows how deep his
humility was; for he consented to converse with a person so
wicked as I was.  He began his visits, he encouraged me, and told
me that I ought not to suppose I could give up everything in one
day; God would bring it about by degrees: he himself had for some
years been unable to free himself from some very slight
imperfections.  O humility! what great blessings thou bringest to
those in whom thou dwellest, and to them who draw near to those
who possess thee!  This holy man--for I think I may justly call
him so--told me of weaknesses of his own, in order to help me.
He, in his humility, thought them weaknesses; but, if we consider
his state, they were neither faults nor imperfections; yet, in my
state, it was a very great fault to be subject to them.

11. I am not saying this without a meaning, though I seem to be
enlarging on trifles; but these trifles contribute so much
towards the beginning of the soul's progress and its flight
upwards, though it has no wings, as they say; and yet no one will
believe it who has not had experience of it; but, as I hope in
God that your reverence will help many a soul, I speak of it
here.  My whole salvation depended on his knowing how to treat
me, on his humility, on the charity with which he conversed with
me, and on his patient endurance of me when he saw that I did not
mend my ways at once.  He went on discreetly, by degrees showing
me how to overcome Satan.  My affection for him so grew upon me,
that I never was more at ease than on the day I used to see him.
I saw him, however, very rarely.  When he was long in coming, I
used to be very much distressed, thinking that he would not see
me because I was so wicked.

12. When he found out my great imperfections, they might well
have been sins, though since I conversed with him I am somewhat
improved,--and when I recounted to him, in order to obtain light
from him, the great graces which God had bestowed upon me, he
told me that these things were inconsistent one with another;
that these consolations were given to people who had made great
progress, and led mortified lives; that he could not help being
very much afraid--he thought that the evil spirit might have
something to do in my case; he would not decide that question,
however, but he would have me carefully consider my whole method
of prayer, and then tell him of it.  That was the difficulty: I
did not understand it myself, and so I could tell him nothing of
my prayer; for the grace to understand it--and, understanding it,
to describe it--has only lately been given me of God.
This saying of his, together with the fear I was in, distressed
me exceedingly, and I cried; for certainly I was anxious to
please God, and I could not persuade myself that Satan had
anything to do with it.  But I was afraid, on account of my great
sins, that God might leave me blind, so that I should
understand nothing.

13. Looking into books to see if I could find anything there by
which I might recognise the prayer I practised, I found in one of
them, called the Ascent of the Mount, [10] and in that part of it
which relates to the union of the soul with God, all those marks
which I had in myself, in that I could not think of anything.
This is what I most dwelt on--that I could think of nothing when
I was in prayer.  I marked that passage, and gave him the book,
that he, and the ecclesiastic mentioned before, [11] saint and
servant of God, might consider it, and tell me what I should do.
If they thought it right, I would give up that method of prayer
altogether; for why should I expose myself to danger, when, at
the end of nearly twenty years, during which I had used it, I had
gained nothing, but had fallen into a delusion of the devil?
It was better for me to give it up.  And yet this seemed to me
hard; for I had already discovered what my soul would become
without prayer.  Everything seemed full of trouble.  I was like a
person in the middle of a river, who, in whatever direction he
may turn, fears a still greater danger, and is well-nigh drowned.
This is a very great trial, and I have gone through many like it,
as I shall show hereafter; [12] and though it does not seem to be
of any importance, it will perhaps be advantageous to understand
how the spirit is to be tried.

14. And certainly the affliction to be borne is great, and
caution is necessary, particularly in the case of women,--for our
weakness is great,--and much evil may be the result of telling
them very distinctly that the devil is busy with them; yea,
rather, the matter should be very carefully considered, and they
should be removed out of reach of the dangers that may arise.
They should be advised to keep things secret; and it is
necessary, also, that their secret should be kept.  I am speaking
of this as one to whom it has been a sore trouble; for some of
those with whom I spoke of my prayer did not keep my secret, but,
making inquiries one of another, for a good purpose, did me much
harm; for they made things known which might well have remained
secret, because not intended for every one and it seemed as if I
had made them public myself. [13]

15. I believe that our Lord permitted [14] this to be done
without sin on their part, in order that I might suffer.  I do
not say that they revealed anything I discussed with them in
confession; still, as they were persons to whom, in my fears, I
gave a full account of myself, in order that they might give me
light, I thought they ought to have been silent.  Nevertheless, I
never dared to conceal anything from such persons.  My meaning,
then, is, that women should be directed with much discretion;
their directors should encourage them, and bide the time when our
Lord will help them, as He has helped me.  If He had not, the
greatest harm would have befallen me, for I was in great fear and
dread; and as I suffered from disease of the heart, [15] I am
astonished that all this did not do me a great deal of harm.

16. Then, when I had given him the book, and told the story of my
life and of my sins, the best way I could in general,--for I was
not in confession, because he was a layman; yet I gave him
clearly to understand how wicked I was,--those two servants of
God, with great charity and affection, considered what was best
for me.  When they had made up their minds what to say,--I was
waiting for it in great dread, having begged many persons to pray
to God for me, and I too had prayed much during those days,--the
nobleman came to me in great distress, and said that, in the
opinion of both, I was deluded by an evil spirit; that the best
thing for me to do was to apply to a certain father of the
Society of Jesus, who would come to me if I sent for him, saying
I had need of him; that I ought, in a general confession, to give
him an account of my whole life, and of the state I was in,--and
all with great clearness: God would, in virtue of the Sacrament
of Confession, give him more light concerning me; for those
fathers were very experienced men in matters of spirituality.
Further, I was not to swerve in a single point from the counsels
of that father; for I was in great danger, if I had no one to
direct me.

17. This answer so alarmed and distressed me, that I knew not
what to do--I did nothing but cry.  Being in an oratory in great
affliction, not knowing what would become of me, I read in a
book--it seemed as if our Lord had put it into my hands--that
St. Paul said, God is faithful; [16] that He will never permit
Satan to deceive those who love Him.  This gave me great
consolation. I began to prepare for my general confession, and to
write out all the evil and all the good: a history of my life, as
clearly as I understood it, and knew how to make it, omitting
nothing whatever.  I remember, when I saw I had written so much
evil, and scarcely anything that was good, that I was exceedingly
distressed and sorrowful.  It pained me, also, that the nuns of
the community should see me converse with such holy persons as
those of the Society of Jesus; for I was afraid of my own
wickedness, and I thought I should be obliged to cease from it,
and give up my amusements; and that if I did not do so, I should
grow worse: so I persuaded the sacristan and the portress to tell
no one of it.  This was of little use, after all; for when I was
called down there was one at the door, as it happened, who told
it to the whole convent.  But what difficulties and what terrors
Satan troubles them with who would draw near unto God!

18. I communicated the whole state of my soul to that servant of
God [17] and he was a great servant of His, and very prudent.
He understood all I told him, explained it to me, and encouraged
me greatly.  He said that all was very evidently the work of the
Spirit of God; only it was necessary for me to go back again to
my prayer, because I was not well grounded, and had not begun to
understand what mortification meant,--that was true, for I do not
think I knew it even by name,--that I was by no means to give up
prayer; on the contrary, I was to do violence to myself in order
to practise it, because God had bestowed on me such special
graces as made it impossible to say whether it was, or was not,
the will of our Lord to do good to many through me. He went
further, for he seems to have prophesied of that which our Lord
afterwards did with me, and said that I should be very much to
blame if I did not correspond with the graces which God bestowed
upon me.  It seems to me that the Holy Ghost was speaking by his
mouth in order to heal my soul, so deep was the impression he
made.  He made me very much ashamed of myself, and directed me by
a way which seemed to change me altogether.  What a grand thing
it is to understand a soul!  He told me to make my prayer every
day on some mystery of the Passion, and that I should profit by
it, and to fix my thoughts on the Sacred Humanity only, resisting
to the utmost of my power those recollections and delights, to
which I was not to yield in any way till he gave me further
directions in the matter.

19. He left me consoled and fortified: our Lord came to my
succour and to his, so that he might understand the state I was
in, and how he was to direct me.  I made a firm resolution not to
swerve from anything he might command me, and to this day I have
kept it.  Our Lord be praised, who has given me grace to be
obedient to my confessors, [18] however imperfectly!--and they
have almost always been those blessed men of the Society of
Jesus; though, as I said, I have but imperfectly obeyed them.
My soul began to improve visibly, as I am now going to say.

Chapter XXIV.


Progress Under Obedience.  Her Inability to Resist the Graces
of God.  God Multiplies His Graces.


1. After this my confession, my soul was so docile that, as it
seems to me, there was nothing in the world I was not prepared to
undertake.  I began at once to make a change in many things,
though my confessor never pressed me--on the contrary, he seemed
to make light of it all.  I was the more influenced by this,
because he led me on by the way of the love of God; he left me
free, and did not press me, unless I did so myself, out of love.
I continued thus nearly two months, doing all I could to resist
the sweetness and graces that God sent.  As to my outward life,
the change was visible; for our Lord gave me courage to go
through with certain things, of which those who knew me--and even
those in the community--said that they seemed to them extreme;
and, indeed, compared with what I had been accustomed to do, they
were extreme: people, therefore, had reason to say so.  Yet, in
those things which were of obligation, considering the habit I
wore, and the profession I had made, I was still deficient.
By resisting the sweetness and joys which God sent me, I gained
this, that His Majesty taught me Himself; for, previously, I used
to think that, in order to obtain sweetness in prayer, it was
necessary for me to hide myself in secret places, and so I
scarcely dared to stir.  Afterwards, I saw how little that was to
the purpose; for the more I tried to distract myself, the more
our Lord poured over me that sweetness and joy which seemed to me
to be flowing around me, so that I could not in any way escape
from it: and so it was.  I was so careful about this resistance,
that it was a pain to me.  But our Lord was more careful to show
His mercies, and during those two months to reveal Himself more
than before, so that I might the better comprehend that it was no
longer in my power to resist Him.

2. I began with a renewed love of the most Sacred Humanity; my
prayer began to be solid, like a house, the foundations of which
are strong; and I was inclined to practise greater penance,
having been negligent in this matter hitherto because of my great
infirmities.  The holy man who heard my confession told me that
certain penances would not hurt me, and that God perhaps sent me
so much sickness because I did no penance; His Majesty would
therefore impose it Himself.  He ordered me to practise certain
acts of mortification not very pleasant for me. [1] I did so,
because I felt that our Lord was enjoining it all, and giving him
grace to command me in such a way as to make me obedient
unto him.

3. My soul was now sensitive to every offence I committed against
God, however slight it might be; so much so, that if I had any
superfluity about me, I could not recollect myself in prayer till
I had got rid of it.  I prayed earnestly that our Lord would hold
me by the hand, and not suffer me to fall again, now that I was
under the direction of His servants.  I thought that would be a
great evil, and that they would lose their credit through me.

4. At this time, Father Francis, who was Duke of Gandia, [2] came
here; he had left all he possessed some years before, and had
entered the Society of Jesus.  My confessor, and the nobleman of
whom I spoke before, [3] contrived that he should visit me, in
order that I might speak to him, and give him an account of my
way of prayer; for they knew him to be greatly favoured and
comforted of God: he had given up much, and was rewarded for it
even in this life.  When he had heard me, he said to me that it
was the work of the Spirit of God, [4] and that he thought it was
not right now to prolong that resistance; that hitherto it had
been safe enough,--only, I should always begin my prayer by
meditating on some part of the Passion and that if our Lord
should then raise up my spirit, I should make no resistance, but
suffer His Majesty to raise it upwards, I myself not seeking it.
He gave both medicine and advice, as one who had made great
progress himself; for experience is very important in these
matters.  He said that further resistance would be a mistake.
I was exceedingly consoled; so, too, was the nobleman, who
rejoiced greatly when he was told that it was the work of God.
He always helped me and gave me advice according to his
power,--and that power was great.

5. At this time, they changed my confessor's residence.  I felt
it very much, for I thought I should go back to my wickedness,
and that it was not possible to find another such as he.  My soul
was, as it were, in a desert, most sorrowful and afraid.  I knew
not what to do with myself.  One of my kinswomen contrived to get
me into her house, and I contrived at once to find another
confessor, [5] in the Society of Jesus.  It pleased our Lord that
I should commence a friendship with a noble lady, [6] a widow,
much given to prayer, who had much to do with the fathers.
She made her own confessor [7] hear me, and I remained in her
house some days.  She lived near, and I delighted in the many
conferences I had with the fathers; for merely by observing the
holiness of their way of life, I felt that my soul
profited exceedingly.

6. This father began by putting me in the way of greater
perfection.  He used to say to me, that I ought to leave nothing
undone that I might be wholly pleasing unto God.  He was,
however, very prudent and very gentle at the same time; for my
soul was not at all strong, but rather very weak, especially as
to giving up certain friendships, though I did not offend God by
them: there was much natural affection in them, and I thought it
would be an act of ingratitude if I broke them off.  And so, as I
did not offend God, I asked him if I must be ungrateful.  He told
me to lay the matter before God for a few days, and recite the
hymn, "Veni, Creator," that God might enlighten me as to the
better course.  One day, having prayed for some time, and
implored our Lord to help me to please Him in all things, I began
the hymn; and as I was saying it, I fell into a trance--so
suddenly, that I was, as it were, carried out of myself.  I could
have no doubt about it, for it was most plain.

7. This was the first time that our Lord bestowed on me the grace
of ecstasy.  I heard these words: "I will not have thee converse
with men, but with angels."  This made me wonder very much; for
the commotion of my spirit was great, and these words were
uttered in the very depth of my soul.  They made me
afraid,--though, on the other hand, they gave me great comfort,
which, when I had lost the fear,--caused, I believe, by the
strangeness of the visitation,--remained with me.

8. Those words have been fulfilled; for I have never been able to
form friendship with, nor have any comfort in, nor any particular
love for, any persons whatever except those who, as I believe,
love God, and who strive to serve Him.  It has not been in my
power to do it.  It is nothing to me that they are my kindred, or
my friends, if I do not know them to be lovers of God, or persons
given to prayer.  It is to me a painful cross to converse with
any one.  This is the truth, so far as I can judge. [8]
From that day forth, I have had courage so great as to leave all
things for God, who in one moment--and it seems to me but a
moment--was pleased to change His servant into another person.
Accordingly, there was no necessity for laying further commands
upon me in this matter.  When my confessor saw how much I clung
to these friendships, he did not venture to bid me distinctly to
give them up.  He must have waited till our Lord did the work--as
He did Himself.  Nor did I think myself that I could succeed; for
I had tried before, and the pain it gave me was so great that I
abandoned the attempt, on the ground that there was nothing
unseemly in those attachments.  Now our Lord set me at liberty,
and gave me strength also to use it.

9. So I told my confessor of it, and gave up everything,
according to his advice.  It did a great deal of good to those
with whom I used to converse, to see my determination.  God be
blessed for ever! Who in one moment set me free, while I had been
for many years making many efforts, and had never succeeded, very
often also doing such violence to myself as injured my health;
but, as it was done by Him Who is almighty, and the true Lord of
all, it gave me no pain whatever.


1. The Saint now treated her body with extreme severity,
disciplining herself even unto blood (Reforma, vol. i. lib. i. c.
xx. § 4).

2. St. Francis de Borja came to Avila, where St. Teresa lived, in
1557 (De la Fuente).  This passage must have been written after
the foundation of St. Joseph, for it was not in the first Life,
as the Saint says, ch. x. § 11, that he kept secret the names of
herself and all others.

3. Ch. xxiii. § 6.

4. See Relation, viii. § 6.

5. Who he was is not certainly known.  The Bollandists decline to
give an opinion: but F. Bouix thinks it was F. Ferdinand Alvarez,
who became her confessor on the removal of F. Juan de Padranos,
and that it was to him she confessed till she placed herself
under the direction of F. Baltasar Alvarez, the confessor of Doña
Guiomar, as it is stated in the next paragraph,--unless the
confessor there mentioned was F. Ferdinand.

6. Doña Guiomar de Ulloa.  See below, ch. xxxii. § 13.

7. If this confessor was F. Baltasar Alvarez, the Saint, F. Bouix
observes, passes rapidly over the history of the year 1557, and
the greater part, perhaps, of 1558; for F. Baltasar was ordained
priest only in the latter year.

Chapter XXV.


Divine Locutions.  Discussions on That Subject.


1. It will be as well, I think, to explain these locutions of
God, and to describe what the soul feels when it receives them,
in order that you, my father, may understand the matter; for ever
since that time of which I am speaking, when our Lord granted me
that grace, it has been an ordinary occurrence until now, as will
appear by what I have yet to say. [1]

2. The words are very distinctly formed; but by the bodily ear
they are not heard.  They are, however, much more clearly
understood than they would be if they were heard by the ear.
It is impossible not to understand them, whatever resistance we
may offer.  When we wish not to hear anything in this world, we
can stop our ears, or give attention to something else: so that,
even if we do hear, at least we can refuse to understand.
In this locution of God addressed to the soul there is no escape,
for in spite of ourselves we must listen; and the understanding
must apply itself so thoroughly to the comprehension of that
which God wills we should hear, that it is nothing to the purpose
whether we will it or not; for it is His will, Who can do all
things.  We should understand that His will must be done; and He
reveals Himself as our true Lord, having dominion over us.
I know this by much experience; for my resistance lasted nearly
two years, [2] because of the great fear I was in: and even now I
resist occasionally; but it is of no use.

3. I should like to explain the delusions which may happen here,
though he who has had much experience will run little or no risk,
I think; but the experience must be great.  I should like to
explain also how those locutions which come from the Good Spirit
differ from those which come from an evil spirit; and, further,
how they may be but an apprehension of the understanding,--for
that is possible,--or even words which the mind addressed to
itself.  I do not know if it be so but even this very day I
thought it possible.  I know by experience in many ways, when
these locutions come from God.  I have been told things two or
three years beforehand, which have all come to pass; and in none
of them have I been hitherto deceived.  There are also other
things in which the Spirit of God may be clearly traced, as I
shall relate by and by. [3]

4. It seems to me that a person commending a matter to God with
great love and earnestness may think that he hears in some way or
other whether his prayer will be granted or not, and this is
quite possible; but he who has heard the divine locution will see
clearly enough what this is, because there is a great difference
between the two.  If it be anything which the understanding has
fashioned, however cunningly it may have done so, he sees that it
is the understanding which has arranged that locution, and that
it is speaking of itself.  This is nothing else but a word
uttered by one, and listened to by another: in that case, the
understanding will see that it has not been listening only, but
also forming the words; and the words it forms are something
indistinct, fantastic, and not clear like the divine locutions.
It is in our power to turn away our attention from these
locutions of our own, just as we can be silent when we are
speaking; but, with respect to the former, that cannot be done.

5. There is another test more decisive still.  The words formed
by the understanding effect nothing; but, when our Lord speaks,
it is at once word and work; and though the words may not be
meant to stir up our devotion, but are rather words of reproof,
they dispose a soul at once, strengthen it, make it tender, give
it light, console and calm it; and if it should be in dryness, or
in trouble and uneasiness, all is removed, as if by the action of
a hand, and even better; for it seems as if our Lord would have
the soul understand that He is all-powerful, and that His words
are deeds.

6. It seems to me that there is as much difference between these
two locutions as there is between speaking and listening, neither
more nor less; for when I speak, as I have just said, [4] I go on
with my understanding arranging what I am saying; but if I am
spoken to by others, I do nothing else but listen, without any
labour.  The human locution is as something which we cannot well
make out, as if we were half asleep; but the divine locution is a
voice so clear that not a syllable of its utterance is lost.
It may occur, too, when the understanding and the soul are so
troubled and distracted that they cannot form one sentence
correctly; and yet grand sentences, perfectly arranged, such as
the soul in its most recollected state never could have formed,
are uttered, and at the first word, as I said, [5] change it
utterly.  Still less could it have formed them if they are
uttered in an ecstasy, when the faculties of the soul are
suspended; for how should the soul then comprehend anything, when
it remembers nothing?--yea, rather, how can it remember them
then, when the memory can hardly do anything at all, and the
imagination is, as it were, suspended?

7. But it is to be observed, that if we see visions and hear
words it never is as at the time when the soul is in union in the
very rapture itself,--so it seems to me.  At that moment, as I
have shown,--I think it was when I was speaking of the second
water, [6]--all the faculties of the soul are suspended; and, as
I think, neither vision, nor understanding, nor hearing, is
possible at that time.  The soul is then wholly in the power of
another; and in that instant--a very brief one, in my
opinion--our Lord leaves it free for nothing whatever; but when
this instant is passed, the soul continuing still entranced, then
is the time of which I am speaking; for the faculties, though not
completely suspended, are so disposed that they are scarcely
active, being, as it were, absorbed, and incapable of making
any reflections.

8. There are so many ways of ascertaining the nature of these
locutions, that if a person be once deceived, he will not be
deceived often.  I mean, that a soul accustomed to them, and on
its guard, will most clearly see what they are; for, setting
other considerations aside which prove what I have said, the
human locution produces no effect, neither does the soul accept
it,--though it must admit the other, whether we like it or
not,--nor does it believe it; on the contrary, it is known to be
a delusion of the understanding, and is therefore put away as we
would put away the ravings of a lunatic.

9. But as to the divine locution, we listen to that as we do to a
person of great holiness, learning, or authority, whom we know to
be incapable of uttering a falsehood.  And yet this is an
inadequate illustration; for these locutions proceed occasionally
in such great majesty that, without our recollecting who it is
that utters them, they make us tremble if they be words of
reproof, and die of love if words of love.  They are also, as I
have said, [7] matters of which the memory has not the least
recollection; and expressions so full are uttered so rapidly,
that much time must have been spent in arranging them, if we
formed them ourselves; and so it seems to me that we cannot
possibly be ignorant at the time that we have never formed them
ourselves at all.

10. There is no reason, therefore, why I should dwell longer on
this matter.  It is a wonder to me that any experienced person,
unless he deliberately chooses to do so, can fall into delusions.
It has often happened to me, when I had doubts, to distrust what
I had heard, and to think that it was all imagination,--but this
I did afterwards: for at the moment that is impossible,--and at a
later time to see the whole fulfilled; for our Lord makes the
words dwell in the memory so that they cannot be forgotten.
Now, that which comes forth from our understanding is, as it
were, the first movement of thought, which passes away and is
forgotten; but the divine locution is a work done; and though
some of it may be forgotten, and time have lapsed, yet is not so
wholly forgotten that the memory loses all traces of what was
once spoken,--unless, indeed, after very long time, or unless the
locution were words of grace or of instruction.  But as to
prophetic words, they are never forgotten, in my opinion; at
least, I have never forgotten any,--and yet my memory is weak.

11. I repeat it, unless a soul be so wicked as to pretend that it
has these locutions, which would be a great sin, and say that it
hears divine words when it hears nothing of the kind, it cannot
possibly fail to see clearly that itself arranges the words, and
utters them to itself.  That seems to me altogether impossible
for any soul that has ever known the Spirit of God.  If it has
not, it may continue all its life long in this delusion, and
imagine that it hears and understands, though I know not how that
can be.  A soul desires to hear these locutions, or it does not;
if it does not, it is distressed because it hears them, and is
unwilling to listen to them, because of a thousand fears which
they occasion, and for many other reasons it has for being quiet
in prayer without these interruptions.  How is it that the
understanding has time enough to arrange these locutions?
They require time.

12. But, on the other side, the divine locutions instruct us
without loss of time, and we understand matters which seem to
require a month on our part to arrange.  The understanding
itself, and the soul, stand amazed at some of the things we
understand.  So it is; and he who has any experience of it will
see that what I am saying is literally true.  I give God thanks
that I have been able thus to explain it.  I end by saying that,
in my opinion, we may hear the locutions that proceed from the
understanding whenever we like, and think that we hear them
whenever we pray.  But it is not so with the divine locutions:
for many days I may desire to hear them, and I cannot; and at
other times, even when I would not, as I said before, [8] hear
them, I must.  It seems to me that any one disposed to deceive
people by saying that he heard from God that which he has
invented himself, might as easily say that he heard it with his
bodily ears.  It is most certainly true that I never imagined
there was any other way of hearing or understanding till I had
proof of it in myself; and so, as I have said before, [9] it gave
me trouble enough.

13. Locutions that come from Satan not only do not leave any good
effects behind, but do leave evil effects.  This has happened to
me; but not more than two or three times.  Our Lord warned me at
once that they came from Satan.  Over and above the great aridity
which remains in the soul after these evil locutions, there is
also a certain disquiet, such as I have had on many other
occasions, when, by our Lord's permission, I fell into great
temptations and travail of soul in diverse ways; and though I am
in trouble often enough, as I shall show hereafter, [10] yet this
disquiet is such that I know not whence it comes; only the soul
seems to resist, is troubled and distressed, without knowing why;
for the words of Satan are good, and not evil.  I am thinking
whether this may not be so because one spirit is conscious of the
presence of another.

14. The sweetness and joy which Satan gives are, in my opinion,
of a very different kind.  By means of these sweetnesses he may
deceive any one who does not, or who never did, taste of the
sweetness of God,--by which I mean a certain sweet, strong,
impressive, delightsome, and calm refreshing.  Those little,
fervid bursts of tears, and other slight emotions,--for at the
first breath of persecution these flowers wither,--I do not call
devotion, though they are a good beginning, and are holy
impressions; but they are not a test to determine whether these
locutions come from a good or an evil spirit.  It is therefore
best for us to proceed always with great caution; for those
persons who have advanced in prayer only so far as this may most
easily fall into delusions, if they have visions or revelations.
For myself, I never had a single vision or revelation till God
had led me on to the prayer of union,--unless it be on that
occasion, of which I have spoken before, [11] now many years ago,
when I saw our Lord.  Oh, that His Majesty had been pleased to
let me then understand that it was a true vision, as I have since
understood it was! it would have been no slight blessing to me.

15. After these locutions of the evil one, the soul is never
gentle, but is, as it were, terrified, and greatly disgusted.

16. I look upon it as a most certain truth, that the devil will
never deceive, and that God will not suffer him to deceive, the
soul which has no confidence whatever in itself; which is strong
in faith, and resolved to undergo a thousand deaths for any one
article of the creed; which in its love of the faith, infused of
God once for all,--a faith living and strong,--always labours,
seeking for further light on this side and on that, to mould
itself on the teaching of the Church, as one already deeply
grounded in the truth.  No imaginable revelations, not even if it
saw the heavens open, could make that soul swerve in any degree
from the doctrine of the Church.  If, however, it should at any
time find itself wavering even in thought on this point, or
stopping to say to itself, If God says this to me, it may be
true, as well as what He said to the Saints--the soul must not be
sure of it.  I do not mean that it so believes, only that Satan
has taken the first step towards tempting it; and the giving way
to the first movements of a thought like this is evidently most
wrong.  I believe, however, that these first movements will not
take place if the soul is so strong in the matter--as that soul
is to whom our Lord sends these graces--that it seems as if it
could crush the evil spirits in defence of the very least of the
truths which the Church holds.

17. If the soul does not discern this great strength in itself,
and if the particular devotion or vision help it not onwards,
then it must not look upon it as safe.  For though at first the
soul is conscious of no harm, great harm may by degrees ensue;
because, so far as I can see, and by experience understand, that
which purports to come from God is received only in so far as it
corresponds with the sacred writings; but if it varies therefrom
ever so little, I am incomparably more convinced that it comes
from Satan than I am now convinced it comes from God, however
deep that conviction may be.  In this case, there is no need to
ask for signs, nor from what spirit it proceeds, because this
varying is so clear a sign of the devil's presence, that if all
the world were to assure me that it came from God, I would not
believe it.  The fact is, that all good seems to be lost out of
sight, and to have fled from the soul, when the devil has spoken
to it; the soul is thrown into a state of disgust, and is
troubled, able to do no good thing whatever--for if it conceives
good desires, they are not strong; its humility is fictitious,
disturbed, and without sweetness.  Any one who has ever tasted of
the Spirit of God will, I think, understand it.

18. Nevertheless, Satan has many devices; and so there is nothing
more certain than that it is safer to be afraid, and always on
our guard, under a learned director, from whom nothing is
concealed.  If we do this, no harm can befall us, though much has
befallen me through the excessive fears which possessed some
people.  For instance, it happened so once to me, when many
persons in whom I had great confidence, and with good reason, had
assembled together,--five or six in number, I think,--and all
very great servants of God.  It is true, my relations were with
one of them only; but by his orders made my state known to the
others.  They had many conferences together about my necessities;
for they had great affection for me, and were afraid I was under
a delusion.  I, too, was very much afraid whenever I was not
occupied in prayer; but when I prayed, and our Lord bestowed His
graces upon me, I was instantly reassured.  My confessor told me
they were all of opinion that I was deceived by Satan; that I
must communicate less frequently, and contrive to distract myself
in such a way as to be less alone.

19. I was in great fear myself, as I have just said, and my
disease of the heart [12] contributed thereto, so that very often
I did not dare to remain alone in my cell during the day.  When I
found so many maintain this, and myself unable to believe them, I
had at once a most grievous scruple; for it seemed to me that I
had very little humility, especially as they all led lives
incomparably better than mine: they were also learned men.
Why should I not believe them?  I did all I could to believe
them.  I reflected on my wicked life, and therefore what they
said to me must be true.

20. In this distress, I quitted the church, [13] and entered an
oratory.  I had not been to Communion for many days, nor had I
been alone, which was all my comfort.  I had no one to speak to,
for every one was against me.  Some, I thought, made a mock of me
when I spoke to them of my prayer, as if I were a person under
delusions of the imagination; others warned my confessor to be on
his guard against me; and some said it was clear the whole was an
operation of Satan.  My confessor, though he agreed with them for
the sake of trying me, as I understood afterwards, always
comforted me: and he alone did so.  He told me that, if I did not
offend God, my prayer, even if it was the work of Satan, could do
me no harm; that I should be delivered from it.  He bade me pray
much to God: he himself, and all his penitents, and many others
did so earnestly; I, too, with all my might, and as many as I
knew to be servants of God, prayed that His Majesty would be
pleased to lead me by another way.  This lasted, I think, about
two years; and this was the subject of my continual prayer to
our Lord.

21. But there was no comfort for me when I thought of the
possibility that Satan could speak to me so often.  Now that I
was never alone for prayer, our Lord made me recollected even
during conversation: He spoke what He pleased,--I could not avoid
it; and, though it distressed me, I was forced to listen.  I was
by myself, having no one in whom I could find any comfort; unable
to pray or read, like a person stunned by heavy trials, and by
the dread that the evil one had deluded me; utterly disquieted
and wearied, not knowing what would become of me.  I have been
occasionally--yea, very often--in distress, but never before in
distress so great.  I was in this state for four or five hours;
there was no comfort for me, either from heaven or on earth--only
our Lord left me to suffer, afraid of a thousand dangers.

22. O my Lord, how true a friend art Thou! how powerful!
Thou showest Thy power when Thou wilt; and Thou dost will it
always, if only we will it also.  Let the whole creation praise
Thee, O Thou Lord of the world!  Oh, that a voice might go forth
over all the earth, proclaiming Thy faithfulness to those who
love Thee! All things fail; but Thou, Lord of all, never failest!
They who love Thee, oh, how little they have to suffer! oh, how
gently, how tenderly, how sweetly Thou, O my Lord, dealest with
them! Oh, that no one had ever been occupied with any other love
than Thine!  It seems as if Thou didst subject those who love
Thee to a severe trial: but it is in order that they may learn,
in the depths of that trial, the depths of Thy love.  O my God,
oh, that I had understanding and learning, and a new language, in
order to magnify Thy works, according to the knowledge of them
which my soul possesses!  Everything fails me, O my Lord; but if
Thou wilt not abandon me, I will never fail Thee.  Let all the
learned rise up against me,--let the whole creation persecute
me,--let the evil spirits torment me,--but do Thou, O Lord, fail
me not; for I know by experience now the blessedness of that
deliverance which Thou dost effect for those who trust only in
Thee.  In this distress,--for then I had never had a single
vision,--these Thy words alone were enough to remove it, and give
me perfect peace: "Be not afraid, my daughter: it is I; and I
will not abandon thee.  Fear not." [14]

23. It seems to me that, in the state I was in then, many hours
would have been necessary to calm me, and that no one could have
done it.  Yet I found myself, through these words alone, tranquil
and strong, courageous and confident, at rest and enlightened; in
a moment, my soul seemed changed, and I felt I could maintain
against all the world that my prayer was the work of God.
Oh, how good is God! how good is our Lord, and how powerful!
He gives not counsel only, but relief as well.  His words are
deeds. O my God! as He strengthens our faith, love grows.  So it
is, in truth; for I used frequently to recollect how our Lord,
when the tempest arose, commanded the winds to be still over the
sea. [15] So I said to myself: Who is He, that all my faculties
should thus obey Him?  Who is He, that gives light in such
darkness in a moment; who softens a heart that seemed to be made
of stone; who gives the waters of sweet tears, where for a long
time great dryness seems to have prevailed; who inspires these
desires; who bestows this courage?  What have I been thinking of?
what am I afraid of? what is it?  I desire to serve this my Lord;
I aim at nothing else but His pleasure; I seek no joy, no rest,
no other good than that of doing His will.  I was so confident
that I had no other desire, that I could safely assert it.

24. Seeing, then, that our Lord is so powerful,--as I see and
know He is,--and that the evil spirits are His slaves, of which
there can be no doubt, because it is of faith,--and I a servant
of this our Lord and King,--what harm can Satan do unto me?
Why have I not strength enough to fight against all hell?  I took
up the cross in my hand,--I was changed in a moment into another
person, and it seemed as if God had really given me courage
enough not to be afraid of encountering all the evil spirits.
It seemed to me that I could, with the cross, easily defeat them
altogether.  So I cried out, Come on, all of you; I am the
servant of our Lord: I should like to see what you can do
against me.

25. And certainly they seemed to be afraid of me, for I was left
in peace: I feared them so little, that the terrors, which until
now oppressed me, quitted me altogether; and though I saw them
occasionally,--I shall speak of this by and by, [16]--I was never
again afraid of them--on the contrary, they seemed to be afraid
of me. [17]  I found myself endowed with a certain authority over
them, given me by the Lord of all, so that I cared no more for
them than for flies.  They seem to be such cowards; for their
strength fails them at the sight of any one who despises them.
These enemies have not the courage to assail any but those whom
they see ready to give in to them, or when God permits them to do
so, for the greater good of His servants, whom they may try
and torment.

26. May it please His Majesty that we fear Him whom we ought to
fear, [18] and understand that one venial sin can do us more harm
than all hell together; for that is the truth.  The evil spirits
keep us in terror, because we expose ourselves to the assaults of
terror by our attachments to honours, possessions, and pleasures.
For then the evil spirits, uniting themselves with us,--we become
our own enemies when we love and seek what we ought to hate,--do
us great harm.  We ourselves put weapons into their hands, that
they may assail us; those very weapons with which we should
defend ourselves.  It is a great pity.  But if, for the love of
God, we hated all this, and embraced the cross, and set about His
service in earnest, Satan would fly away before such realities,
as from the plague.  He is the friend of lies, and a lie
himself. [19]  He will have nothing to do with those who walk in
the truth.  When he sees the understanding of any one obscured,
he simply helps to pluck out his eyes; if he sees any one already
blind, seeking peace in vanities,--for all the things of this
world are so utterly vanity, that they seem to be but the
playthings of a child,--he sees at once that such a one is a
child; he treats him as a child, and ventures to wrestle with
him--not once, but often.

27. May it please our Lord that I be not one of these; and may
His Majesty give me grace to take that for peace which is really
peace, that for honour which is really honour, and that for
delight which is really a delight.  Let me never mistake one
thing for another--and then I snap my fingers at all the devils,
for they shall be afraid of me.  I do not understand those
terrors which make us cry out, Satan, Satan! when we may say,
God, God! and make Satan tremble.  Do we not know that he cannot
stir without the permission of God?  What does it mean?  I am
really much more afraid of those people who have so great a fear
of the devil, than I am of the devil himself.  Satan can do me no
harm whatever, but they can trouble me very much, particularly if
they be confessors.  I have spent some years of such great
anxiety, that even now I am amazed that I was able to bear it.
Blessed be our Lord, who has so effectually helped me!

How the Fears of the Saint Vanished.  How She Was Assured That
Her Prayer Was the Work of the Holy Spirit.


1. I look upon the courage which our Lord has implanted in me
against evil spirits as one of the greatest mercies which He has
bestowed upon me; for a cowardly soul, afraid of anything but sin
against God, is a very unseemly thing, when we have on our side
the King omnipotent, our Lord most high, who can do all things,
and subjects all things to Himself.  There is nothing to be
afraid of if we walk, as I said before, [1] in the truth, in the
sight of His Majesty, with a pure conscience.  And for this end,
as I said in the same place, I would have myself all fears, that
I may not for one instant offend Him who in that instant is able
to destroy us.  If His Majesty is pleased with us, whoever
resists us--be he who he may--will be utterly disappointed.

2. It may be so, you will say; but, then, where is that soul so
just as to please Him in everything?--and that is the reason why
we are afraid.  Certainly it is not my soul, which is most
wretched, unprofitable, and full of misery.  God is not like man
in His ways; He knows our weakness.  But the soul perceives, by
the help of certain great signs, whether it loves God of a truth;
for the love of those souls who have come to this state is not
hidden as it was at first, but is full of high impulses, and of
longings for the vision of God, as I shall show hereafter--or
rather, as I have shown already. [2]  Everything wearies,
everything distresses, everything torments the soul, unless it be
suffered with God, or for God.  There is no rest which is not a
weariness, because the soul knows itself to be away from its true
rest; and so love is made most manifest, and, as I have just
said, impossible to hide.

3. It happened to me, on another occasion to be grievously tried,
and much spoken against on account of a certain affair,--of which
I will speak hereafter, [3]--by almost everybody in the place
where I am living, and by the members of my Order.  When I was in
this distress, and afflicted by many occasions of disquiet
wherein I was placed, our Lord spoke to me, saying: "What art
thou afraid of? knowest thou not that I am almighty?  I will do
what I have promised thee."  And so, afterwards, was it done.
I found myself at once so strong, that I could have undertaken
anything, so it seemed, immediately, even if I had to endure
greater trials for His service, and had to enter on a new state
of suffering.  These locutions are so frequent, that I cannot
count them; many of them are reproaches, and He sends them when I
fall into imperfections.  They are enough to destroy a soul.
They correct me, however; for His Majesty--as I said
before [4]--gives both counsel and relief.  There are others
which bring my former sins into remembrance,--particularly when
He is about to bestow upon me some special grace,--in such a way
that the soul beholds itself as being really judged; for those
reproaches of God put the truth before it so distinctly, that it
knows not what to do with itself.  Some are warnings against
certain dangers to myself or others; many of them are prophecies
of future things, three or four years beforehand; and all of them
have been fulfilled: some of them I could mention.  Here, then,
are so many reasons for believing that they come from God, as
make it impossible, I believe, for anybody to mistake them.

4. The safest course in these things is to declare, without fail,
the whole state of the soul, together with the graces our Lord
gives me, to a confessor who is learned, and obey him.  I do so;
and if I did not, I should have no peace.  Nor is it right that
we women, who are unlearned, should have any: there can be no
danger in this, but rather great profit.  This is what our Lord
has often commanded me to do, and it is what I have often done.
I had a confessor [5] who mortified me greatly, and now and then
distressed me: he tried me heavily, for he disquieted me
exceedingly; and yet he was the one who, I believe, did me the
most good.  Though I had a great affection for him, I was
occasionally tempted to leave him; I thought that the pain he
inflicted on me disturbed my prayer.  Whenever I was resolved on
leaving him, I used to feel instantly that I ought not to do so;
and one reproach of our Lord would press more heavily upon me
than all that my confessor did.  Now and then, I was worn
out--torture on the one hand, reproaches on the other.
I required it all, for my will was but little subdued.  Our Lord
said to me once, that there was no obedience where there was no
resolution to suffer; that I was to think of His sufferings, and
then everything would be easy.

5. One of my confessors, to whom I went in the beginning, advised
me once, now that my spiritual state was known to be the work of
God, to keep silence, and not speak of these things to any one,
on the ground that it was safer to keep these graces secret.
To me, the advice seemed good, because I felt it so much whenever
I had to speak of them to my confessor; [6] I was also so ashamed
of myself, that I felt it more keenly at times to speak of them
than I should have done in confessing grave sins, particularly
when the graces I had to reveal were great.  I thought they did
not believe me, and that they were laughing at me.  I felt it so
much,--for I look on this as an irreverent treatment of the
marvels of God,--that I was glad to be silent. I learned then
that I had been ill-advised by that confessor, because I ought
never to hide anything from my confessor; for I should find great
security if I told everything; and if I did otherwise, I might at
any time fall into delusions. [7]

6. Whenever our Lord commanded me to do one thing in prayer, and
if my confessor forbade it, our Lord Himself told me to obey my
confessor.  His Majesty afterwards would change the mind of that
confessor, so that he would have me do what he had forbidden
before.  When we were deprived of many books written in Spanish,
and forbidden to read them,--I felt it deeply, for some of these
books were a great comfort to me, and I could not read them in
Latin,--our Lord said to me, "Be not troubled; I will give thee a
living book."  I could not understand why this was said to me,
for at that time I had never had a vision. [8]  But, a very few
days afterwards, I understood it well enough; for I had so much
to think of, and such reasons for self-recollection in what I saw
before me and our Lord dealt so lovingly with me, in teaching me
in so many ways, that I had little or no need whatever of books.
His Majesty has been to me a veritable Book, in which I saw all
truth.  Blessed be such a Book, which leaves behind an impression
of what is read therein, and in such a way that it cannot
be forgotten!

7. Who can look upon our Lord, covered with wounds, and bowed
down under persecutions, without accepting, loving, and longing
for them?  Who can behold but a part of that glory which He will
give to those who serve Him without confessing that all he may
do, and all he may suffer, are altogether as nothing, when we may
hope for such a reward?  Who can look at the torments of lost
souls without acknowledging the torments of this life to be
joyous delights in comparison, and confessing how much they owe
to our Lord in having saved them so often from the place of
torments? [9]  But as, by the help of God, I shall speak more at
large of certain things, I wish now to go on with the story of my
life.  Our Lord grant that I have been clear enough in what I
have hitherto said!  I feel assured that he will understand me
who has had experience herein, and that he will see I have
partially succeeded; but as to him who has had no such
experience, I should not be surprised if he regarded it all as
folly.  It is enough for him that it is I who say it, in order to
be free from blame; neither will I blame any one who shall so
speak of it.  Our Lord grant that I may never fail to do His
will!  Amen.

Chapter XXVII.


The Saint Prays to Be Directed by a Different Way.
Intellectual Visions.


1. I now resume the story of my life.  I was in great pain and
distress; and many prayers, as I said, [1] were made on my
behalf, that our Lord would lead me by another and a safer way;
for this, they told me, was so suspicious.  The truth is, that
though I was praying to God for this, and wished I had a desire
for another way, yet, when I saw the progress I was making, I was
unable really to desire a change,--though I always prayed for
it,--excepting on those occasions when I was extremely cast down
by what people said to me, and by the fears with which they
filled me.

2. I felt that I was wholly changed; I could do nothing but put
myself in the hands of God: He knew what was expedient for me;
let Him do with me according to His will in all things.  I saw
that by this way I was directed heavenwards, and that formerly I
was going down to hell.  I could not force myself to desire a
change, nor believe that I was under the influence of Satan.
Though I was doing all I could to believe the one and to desire
the other, it was not in my power to do so.  I offered up all my
actions, if there should be any good in them, for this end; I had
recourse to the Saints for whom I had a devotion, that they might
deliver me from the evil one; I made novenas; I commended myself
to St. Hilarion, to the Angel St. Michael, to whom I had recently
become devout, for this purpose; and many other Saints I
importuned, that our Lord might show me the way,--I mean, that
they might obtain this for me from His Majesty.

3. At the end of two years spent in prayer by myself and others
for this end, namely, that our Lord would either lead me by
another way, or show the truth of this,--for now the locutions of
our Lord were extremely frequent,--this happened to me.  I was in
prayer one day,--it was the feast of the glorious
St. Peter, [2]--when I saw Christ close by me, or, to speak more
correctly, felt Him; for I saw nothing with the eyes of the body,
nothing with the eyes of the soul.  He seemed to me to be close
beside me; and I saw, too, as I believe, that it was He who was
speaking to me. As I was utterly ignorant that such a vision was
possible, [3] I was extremely afraid at first, and did nothing
but weep; however, when He spoke to me but one word to reassure
me, I recovered myself, and was, as usual, calm and comforted,
without any fear whatever.  Jesus Christ seemed to be by my side
continually, and, as the vision was not imaginary, I saw no form;
but I had a most distinct feeling that He was always on my right
hand, a witness of all I did; and never at any time, if I was but
slightly recollected, or not too much distracted, could I be
ignorant of His near presence. [4]

4. I went at once to my confessor, [5] in great distress, to tell
him of it.  He asked in what form I saw our Lord.  I told him I
saw no form.  He then said: "How did you know that it was
Christ?"  I replied, that I did not know how I knew it; but I
could not help knowing that He was close beside me,--that I saw
Him distinctly, and felt His presence,--that the recollectedness
of my soul was deeper in the prayer of quiet, and more
continuous,--that the effects thereof were very different from
what I had hitherto experienced,--and that it was most certain.
I could only make comparisons in order to explain myself; and
certainly there are no comparisons, in my opinion, by which
visions of this kind can be described.  Afterwards I learnt from
Friar Peter of Alcantara, a holy man of great spirituality,--of
whom I shall speak by and by, [6]--and from others of great
learning, that this vision was of the highest order, and one with
which Satan can least interfere; and therefore there are no words
whereby to explain,--at least, none for us women, who know so
little: learned men can explain it better.

5. For if I say that I see Him neither with the eyes of the body,
nor with those of the soul,--because it was not an imaginary
vision,--how is it that I can understand and maintain that He
stands beside me, and be more certain of it than if I saw Him?
If it be supposed that it is as if a person were blind, or in the
dark, and therefore unable to see another who is close to him,
the comparison is not exact.  There is a certain likelihood about
it, however, but not much, because the other senses tell him who
is blind of that presence: he hears the other speak or move, or
he touches him; but in these visions there is nothing like this.
The darkness is not felt; only He renders Himself present to the
soul by a certain knowledge of Himself which is more clear than
the sun. [7]  I do not mean that we now see either a sun or any
brightness, only that there is a light not seen, which illumines
the understanding so that the soul may have the fruition of so
great a good.  This vision brings with it great blessings.

6. It is not like that presence of God which is frequently felt,
particularly by those who have attained to the prayer of union
and of quiet, when we seem, at the very commencement of our
prayer, to find Him with whom we would converse, and when we seem
to feel that He hears us by the effects and the spiritual
impressions of great love and faith of which we are then
conscious, as well as by the good resolutions, accompanied by
sweetness, which we then make.  This is a great grace from God;
and let him to whom He has given it esteem it much, because it is
a very high degree of prayer; but it is not vision.  God is
understood to be present there by the effects He works in the
soul: that is the way His Majesty makes His presence felt; but
here, in this vision, it is seen clearly that Jesus Christ is
present, the Son of the Virgin.  In the prayer of union and of
quiet, certain inflowings of the Godhead are present; but in the
vision, the Sacred Humanity also, together with them, is pleased
to be our visible companion, and to do us good.

7. My confessor next asked me, who told me it was Jesus
Christ. [8]  I replied that He often told me so Himself; but,
even before He told me so, there was an impression on my
understanding that it was He; and before this He used to tell me
so, and I saw Him not.  If a person whom I had never seen, but of
whom I had heard, came to speak to me, and I were blind or in the
dark, and told me who he was, I should believe him; but I could
not so confidently affirm that he was that person, as I might do
if I had seen him.  But in this vision I could do so, because so
clear a knowledge is impressed on the soul that all doubt seems
impossible, though He is not seen.  Our Lord wills that this
knowledge be so graven on the understanding, that we can no more
question His presence than we can question that which we see with
our eyes: not so much even; for very often there arises a
suspicion that we have imagined things we think we see; but here,
though there may be a suspicion in the first instant, there
remains a certainty so great, that the doubt has no force
whatever.  So also is it when God teaches the soul in another
way, and speaks to it without speaking, in the way I
have described.

8. There is so much of heaven in this language, that it cannot
well be understood on earth, though we may desire ever so much to
explain it, if our Lord will not teach it experimentally.
Our Lord impresses in the innermost soul that which He wills that
soul to understand; and He manifests it there without images or
formal words, after the manner of the vision I am speaking of.
Consider well this way in which God works, in order that the soul
may understand what He means--His great truths and mysteries; for
very often what I understand, when our Lord explains to me the
vision, which it is His Majesty's pleasure to set before me, is
after this manner; and it seems to me that this is a state with
which the devil can least interfere, for these reasons; but if
these reasons are not good, I must be under a delusion.  The
vision and the language are matters of such pure spirituality,
that there is no toil of the faculties, or of the senses, out of
which--so seems to me--the devil can derive any advantage.

9. It is only at intervals, and for an instant, that this occurs;
for generally--so I think--the senses are not taken away, and the
faculties are not suspended: they preserve their ordinary state.
It is not always so in contemplation; on the contrary, it is very
rarely so; but when it is so, I say that we do nothing whatever
ourselves: no work of ours is then possible; all that is done is
apparently the work of our Lord.  It is as if food had been
received into the stomach which had not first been eaten, and
without our knowing how it entered; but we do know well that it
is there, though we know not its nature, nor who it was that
placed it there.  In this vision, I know who placed it; but I do
not know how He did it.  I neither saw it, nor felt it; I never
had any inclination to desire it, and I never knew before that
such a thing was possible.

10. In the locutions of which I spoke before, [9] God makes the
understanding attentive, though it may be painful to understand
what is said; then the soul seems to have other ears wherewith it
hears; and He forces it to listen, and will not let it be
distracted.  The soul is like a person whose hearing was good,
and who is not suffered to stop his ears, while people standing
close beside him speak to him with a loud voice.  He may be
unwilling to hear, yet hear he must.  Such a person contributes
something of his own; for he attends to what is said to him; but
here there is nothing of the kind: even that little, which is
nothing more than the bare act of listening, which is granted to
it in the other case, is now out of its power.  It finds its food
prepared and eaten; it has nothing more to do but to enjoy it.
It is as if one without ever learning, without taking the pains
even to learn to read, and without studying any subject whatever,
should find himself in possession of all knowledge, not knowing
how or whence it came to him, seeing that he had never taken the
trouble even to learn the alphabet.  This last comparison seems
to me to throw some light on this heavenly gift; for the soul
finds itself learned in a moment, and the mystery of the most
Holy Trinity so clearly revealed to it, together with other most
deep doctrines, that there is no theologian in the world with
whom it would hesitate to dispute for the truth of these matters.

11. It is impossible to describe the surprise of the soul when it
finds that one of these graces is enough to change it utterly,
and make it love nothing but Him who, without waiting for
anything itself might do, renders it fit for blessings so high,
communicates to it His secrets, and treats it with so much
affection and love.  Some of the graces He bestows are liable to
suspicion because they are so marvellous, and given to one who
has deserved them so little--incredible, too, without a most
lively faith.  I intend, therefore, to mention very few of those
graces which our Lord has wrought in me, if I should not be
ordered otherwise; but there are certain visions of which I shall
speak, an account of which may be of some service.  In doing so,
I shall either dispel his fears to whom our Lord sends them, and
who, as I used to do, thinks them impossible, or I shall explain
the way or the road by which our Lord has led me; and that is
what I have been commanded to describe.

12. Now, going back to speak of this way of understanding, what
it is seems to me to be this: it is our Lord's will in every way
that the soul should have some knowledge of what passes in
heaven; and I think that, as the blessed there without speech
understand one another,--I never knew this for certain till our
Lord of His goodness made me see it; He showed it to me in a
trance,--so is it here: God and the soul understand one another,
merely because His Majesty so wills it, without the help of other
means, to express the love there is between them both.  In the
same way on earth, two persons of sound sense, if they love each
other much, can even, without any signs, understand one another
only by their looks.  It must be so here, though we do not see
how, as these two lovers earnestly regard each the other: the
bridegroom says so to the bride in the Canticle, so I believe,
and I have heard that it is spoken of there. [10]

13. Oh, marvellous goodness of God, in that Thou permittest eyes
which have looked upon so much evil as those of my soul to look
upon Thee!  May they never accustom themselves, after looking on
Thee, to look upon vile things again! and may they have pleasure
in nothing but in Thee, O Lord!  Oh, ingratitude of men, how far
will it go!  I know by experience that what I am saying is true,
and that all we can say is exceedingly little, when we consider
what Thou doest to the soul which Thou hast led to such a state
as this.  O souls, you who have begun to pray, and you who
possess the true faith, what can you be in search of even in this
life, let alone that which is for ever, that is comparable to the
least of these graces?  Consider, and it is true, that God gives
Himself to those who give up everything for Him.  God is not an
accepter of persons. [11]  He loves all; there is no excuse for
any one, however wicked he may be, seeing that He hath thus dealt
with me, raising me to the state I am in. Consider, that what I
am saying is not even an iota of what may be said; I say only
that which is necessary to show the kind of the vision and of the
grace which God bestows on the soul; for that cannot be told
which it feels when our Lord admits it to the understanding of
His secrets and of His mighty works.  The joy of this is so far
above all conceivable joys, that it may well make us loathe all
the joys of earth; for they are all but dross; and it is an
odious thing to make them enter into the comparison, even if we
might have them for ever.  Those which our Lord gives, what are
they?  One drop only of the waters of the overflowing river which
He is reserving for us.

14. It is a shame!  And, in truth, I am ashamed of myself; if
shame could have a place in heaven, I should certainly be the
most ashamed there.  Why do we seek blessings and joys so great,
bliss without end, and all at the cost of our good Jesus?
Shall we not at least weep with the daughters of Jerusalem, [12]
if we do not help to carry his cross with the Cyrenean? [13]
Is it by pleasure and idle amusements that we can attain to the
fruition of what He purchased with so much blood?  It is
impossible.  Can we think that we can, by preserving our honour,
which is vanity, recompense Him for the sufferings He endured,
that we might reign with Him for ever?  This is not the way; we
are going by the wrong road utterly, and we shall never arrive
there.  You, my father, must lift up your voice, and utter these
truths aloud, seeing that God has taken from me the power of
doing it.  I should like to utter them to myself for ever.
I listened to them myself, and came to the knowledge of God so
late, as will appear by what I have written, that I am ashamed of
myself when I speak of this; and so I should like to be silent.

15. Of one thing, however, I will speak, and I think of it now
and then,--may it be the good pleasure of our Lord to bring me
on, so that I may have the fruition of it!--what will be the
accidental glory and the joy of the blessed who have entered on
it, when they see that, though they were late, yet they left
nothing undone which it was possible for them to do for God, who
kept nothing back they could give Him, and who gave what they
gave in every way they could, according to their strength and
their measure,--they who had more gave more.  How rich will he be
who gave up all his riches for Christ!  How honourable will he be
who, for His sake, sought no honours whatever, but rather took
pleasure in seeing himself abased!  How wise he will be who
rejoiced when men accounted him as mad!--they did so of Wisdom
Itself! [14]  How few there are of this kind now, because of our
sins!  Now, indeed, they are all gone whom people regarded as
mad, [15] because they saw them perform heroic acts, as true
lovers of Christ.

16. O world, world! how thou art gaining credit because they are
few who know thee!  But do we suppose that God is better pleased
when men account us wise and discreet persons?  We think
forthwith that there is but little edification given when people
do not go about, every one in his degree, with great gravity, in
a dignified way.  Even in the friar, the ecclesiastic, and the
nun, if they wear old and patched garments, we think it a
novelty, and a scandal to the weak; and even if they are very
recollected and given to prayer.  Such is the state of the world,
and so forgotten are matters of perfection, and those grand
impetuosities of the Saints.  More mischief, I think, is done in
this way, than by any scandal that might arise if the religious
showed in their actions, as they proclaim it in words, that the
world is to be held in contempt.  Out of scandals such as this,
our Lord obtains great fruit.  If some people took scandal,
others are filled with remorse: anyhow, we should have before us
some likeness of that which our Lord and His Apostles endured;
for we have need of it now more than ever.

17. And what an excellent likeness in the person of that blessed
friar, Peter of Alcantara, God has just taken from us! [16]
The world cannot bear such perfection now; it is said that men's
health is grown feebler, and that we are not now in those former
times.  But this holy man lived in our day; he had a spirit
strong as those of another age, and so he trampled on the world.
If men do not go about barefooted, nor undergo sharp penances, as
he did, there are many ways, as I have said before, [17] of
trampling on the world; and our Lord teaches them when He finds
the necessary courage. How great was the courage with which His
Majesty filled the Saint I am speaking of!  He did penance--oh,
how sharp it was!--for seven-and-forty years, as all men know.
I should like to speak of it, for I know it to be all true.

18. He spoke of it to me and to another person, from whom he kept
few or no secrets.  As for me, it was the affection he bore me
that led him to speak; for it was our Lord's will that he should
undertake my defence, and encourage me, at a time when I was in
great straits, as I said before, and shall speak of again. [18]
He told me, I think, that for forty years he slept but an hour
and a half out of the twenty-four, and that the most laborious
penance he underwent, when he began, was this of overcoming
sleep.  For that purpose, he was always either kneeling or
standing.  When he slept, he sat down, his head resting against a
piece of wood driven into the wall.  Lie down he could not, if he
wished it; for his cell, as every one knows, was only four feet
and a half in length.  In all these years, he never covered his
head with his hood, even when the sun was hottest, or the rain
heaviest.  He never covered his feet: the only garment he wore
was made of sackcloth, and that was as tight as it could be, with
nothing between it and his flesh; over this, he wore a cloak of
the same stuff.  He told me that, in the severe cold, he used to
take off his cloak, and open the door and the window of his cell,
in order that when he put his cloak on again, after shutting the
door and the window, he might give some satisfaction to his body
in the pleasure it might have in the increased warmth.
His ordinary practice was to eat but once in three days.  He said
to me, "Why are you astonished at it? it is very possible for any
one who is used to it."  One of his companions told me that he
would be occasionally eight days without eating: that must have
been when he was in prayer; for he was subject to trances, and to
the impetuosities of the love of God, of which I was once a
witness myself.

19. His poverty was extreme; and his mortification, from his
youth, was such,--so he told me,--that he was three years in one
of the houses of his Order without knowing how to distinguish one
friar from another, otherwise than by the voice; for he never
raised his eyes: and so, when he was obliged to go from one part
of the house to the other, he never knew the way, unless he
followed the friars.  His journeys, also, were made in the same
way.  For many years, he never saw a woman's face.  He told me
that it was nothing to him then whether he saw it or not: but he
was an aged man when I made his acquaintance; and his weakness
was so great, that he seemed like nothing else but the roots of
trees.  With all his sanctity, he was very agreeable; though his
words were few, unless when he was asked questions; he was very
pleasant to speak to, for he had a most clear understanding.

20. Many other things I should like to say of him, if I were not
afraid, my father, that you will say, Why does she meddle here?
and it is in that fear I have written this.  So I leave the
subject, only saying that his last end was like his
life--preaching to, and exhorting, his brethren.  When he saw
that the end was comes he repeated the Psalm, [19] "Lætatus sum
in his quæ dicta sunt mihi;" and then, kneeling down, he died.

21. Since then, it has pleased our Lord that I should find more
help from him than during his life.  He advises me in many
matters.  I have often seen him in great glory.  The first time
he appeared to me, he said: "O blessed penance, which has merited
so great a reward!" with other things.  A year before his death,
he appeared to me being then far away.  I knew he was about to
die, and so I sent him word to that effect, when he was some
leagues from here.  When he died, he appeared to me, and said
that he was going to his rest.  I did not believe it.  I spoke of
it to some persons, and within eight days came the news that he
was dead--or, to speak more correctly, he had begun to live
for evermore. [20]

22. Behold here, then, how that life of sharp penance is
perfected in such great glory: and now he is a greater comfort to
me, I do believe, than he was on earth.  Our Lord said to me on
one occasion, that persons could not ask Him anything in his
name, and He not hear them.  I have recommended many things to
him that he was to ask of our Lord, and I have seen my petitions
granted.  God be blessed for ever!  Amen.

23. But how I have been talking in order to stir you up never to
esteem anything in this life!--as if you did not know this, or as
if you were not resolved to leave everything, and had already
done it!  I see so much going wrong in the world, that though my
speaking of it is of no other use than to weary me by writing of
it, it is some relief to me that all I am saying makes against
myself.  Our Lord forgive me all that I do amiss herein; and you
too, my father, for wearying you to no purpose.  It seems as if I
would make you do penance for my sins herein.

Chapter XXVIII.


Visions of the Sacred Humanity, and of the Glorified Bodies.
Imaginary Visions.  Great Fruits Thereof When They Come from God.


1. I now resume our subject.  I spent some days, not many, with
that vision [1] continually before me.  It did me so much good,
that I never ceased to pray.  Even when I did cease, I contrived
that it should be in such a way as that I should not displease
Him whom I saw so clearly present, an eye-witness of my acts.
And though I was occasionally afraid, because so much was said to
me about delusions, that fear lasted not long, because our Lord
reassured me.

2. It pleased our Lord, one day that I was in prayer, to show me
His Hands, and His Hands only.  The beauty of them was so great,
that no language can describe it.  This put me in great fear; for
everything that is strange, in the beginning of any new grace
from God, makes me very much afraid.  A few days later, I saw His
divine Face, and I was utterly entranced.  I could not understand
why our Lord showed Himself in this way, seeing that, afterwards,
He granted me the grace of seeing His whole Person.  Later on, I
understood that His Majesty was dealing with me according to the
weakness of my nature.  May He be blessed for ever!  A glory so
great was more than one so base and wicked could bear; and our
merciful Lord, knowing this, ordered it in this way.

3. You will think, my father, that it required no great courage
to look upon Hands and Face so beautiful.  But so beautiful are
glorified bodies, that the glory which surrounds them renders
those who see that which is so supernatural and beautiful beside
themselves.  It was so with me: I was in such great fear,
trouble, and perplexity at the sight.  Afterwards there ensued a
sense of safety and certainty, together with other results, so
that all fear passed immediately away. [2]

4. On one of the feasts of St. Paul, [3] when I was at Mass,
there stood before me the most Sacred Humanity, [4] as painters
represent Him after the resurrection, in great beauty and
majesty, as I particularly described it to you, my father, when
you had insisted on it.  It was painful enough to have to write
about it, for I could not describe it without doing great
violence to myself.  But I described it as well as I could, and
there is no reason why I should now recur to it.  One thing,
however, I have to say: if in heaven itself there were nothing
else to delight our eyes but the great beauty of glorified
bodies, that would be an excessive bliss, particularly the vision
of the Humanity of Jesus Christ our Lord.  If here below, where
His Majesty shows Himself to us according to the measure which
our wretchedness can bear, it is so great, what must it be there,
where the fruition of it is complete!

5. This vision, though imaginary, I never saw with my bodily
eyes, nor, indeed, any other, but only with the eyes of the soul.
Those who understand these things better than I do, say that the
intellectual vision is more perfect than this; and this, the
imaginary vision, much more perfect than those visions which are
seen by the bodily eyes.  The latter kind of visions, they say,
is the lowest; and it is by these that the devil can most delude
us. [5]  I did not know it then; for I wished, when this grace
had been granted me, that it had been so in such a way that I
could see it with my bodily eyes, in order that my confessor
might not say to me that I indulged in fancies.

6. After the vision was over, it happened that I too
imagined--the thought came at once--I had fancied these things;
so I was distressed, because I had spoken of them to my
confessor, thinking that I might have been deceiving him.
There was another lamentation: I went to my confessor, and told
him of my doubts. He would ask me whether I told him the truth so
far as I knew it; or, if not, had I intended to deceive him?
I would reply, that I told the truth; for, to the best of my
belief, I did not lie, nor did I mean anything of the kind;
neither would I tell a lie for the whole world. [6]  This he knew
well enough; and, accordingly, he contrived to quiet me; and I
felt so much the going to him with these doubts, that I cannot
tell how Satan could have put it into my head that I invented
those things for the purpose of tormenting myself.

7. But our Lord made such haste to bestow this grace upon me, and
to declare the reality of it, that all doubts of the vision being
a fancy on my part were quickly taken away, and ever since I see
most clearly how silly I was.  For if I were to spend many years
in devising how to picture to myself anything so beautiful, I
should never be able, nor even know how, to do it for it is
beyond the reach of any possible imagination here below: the
whiteness and brilliancy alone are inconceivable.  It is not a
brilliancy which dazzles, but a delicate whiteness and a
brilliancy infused, furnishing the most excessive delight to the
eyes, never wearied thereby, nor by the visible brightness which
enables us to see a beauty so divine.  It is a light so different
from any light here below, that the very brightness of the sun we
see, in comparison with the brightness and light before our eyes,
seems to be something so obscure, that no one would ever wish to
open his eyes again.

8. It is like most pellucid water running in a bed of crystal,
reflecting the rays of the sun, compared with most muddy water on
a cloudy day, flowing on the surface of the earth.  Not that
there is anything like the sun present here, nor is the light
like that of the sun: this light seems to be natural; and, in
comparison with it, every other light is something artificial.
It is a light which knows no night; but rather, as it is always
light, nothing ever disturbs it.  In short, it is such that no
man, however gifted he may be, can ever, in the whole course of
his life, arrive at any imagination of what it is.  God puts it
before us so instantaneously, that we could not open our eyes in
time to see it, if it were necessary for us to open them at all.
But whether our eyes be open or shut, it makes no difference
whatever; for when our Lord wills, we must see it, whether we
will or not.  No distraction can shut it out, no power can resist
it, nor can we attain to it by any diligence or efforts of our
own.  I know this by experience well, as I shall show you.

9. That which I wish now to speak of is the manner in which our
Lord manifests Himself in these visions.  I do not mean that I am
going to explain how it is that a light so strong can enter the
interior sense, or so distinct an image the understanding, so as
to seem to be really there; for this must be work for learned
men.  Our Lord has not been pleased to let me understand how it
is.  I am so ignorant myself, and so dull of understanding, that,
although people have very much wished to explain it to me, I have
never been able to understand how it can be.

10. This is the truth: though you, my father, may think that I
have a quick understanding, it is not so; for I have found out,
in many ways, that my understanding can take in only, as they
say, what is given to it to eat.  Sometimes my confessor used to
be amazed at my ignorance: and he never explained to me--nor,
indeed, did I desire to understand--how God did this, nor how it
could be.  Nor did I ever ask; though, as I have said, [7] I had
converse for many years with men of great learning.  But I did
ask them if this or that were a sin or not: as for everything
else, the thought that God did it all was enough for me.  I saw
there was no reason to be afraid, but great reason to praise Him.
On the other hand, difficulties increase my devotion; and the
greater the difficulty the greater the increase.

11. I will therefore relate what my experience has shown me; but
how our Lord brought it about, you, my father, will explain
better than I can, and make clear all that is obscure, and beyond
my skill to explain.  Now and then it seemed to me that what I
saw was an image; but most frequently it was not so.  I thought
it was Christ Himself, judging by the brightness in which He was
pleased to show Himself.  Sometimes the vision was so indistinct,
that I thought it was an image; but still not like a picture,
however well painted--and I have seen many good pictures.
It would be absurd to suppose that the one bears any resemblance
whatever to the other, for they differ as a living person differs
from his portrait, which, however well drawn, cannot be lifelike,
for it is plain that it is a dead thing.  But let this pass,
though to the purpose, and literally true.

12. I do not say this by way of comparison, for comparisons are
never exact, but because it is the truth itself, as there is the
same difference here that there is between a living subject and
the portrait thereof, neither more nor less: for if what I saw
was an image, it was a living image,--not a dead man, but the
living Christ: and He makes me see that He is God and man,--not
as He was in the sepulchre, but as He was when He had gone forth
from it, risen from the dead.  He comes at times in majesty so
great, that no one can have any doubt that it is our Lord
Himself, especially after Communion: we know that He is then
present, for faith says so.  He shows Himself so clearly to be
the Lord of that little dwelling-place, that the soul seems to be
dissolved and lost in Christ.  O my Jesus, who can describe the
majesty wherein Thou showest Thyself!  How utterly Thou art the
Lord of the whole world, and of heaven, and of a thousand other
and innumerable worlds and heavens, the creation of which is
possible to Thee!  The soul understands by that majesty wherein
Thou showest Thyself that it is nothing for Thee to be Lord of
all this.

13. Here it is plain, O my Jesus, how slight is the power of all
the devils in comparison with Thine, and how he who is pleasing
unto Thee is able to tread all hell under his feet.  Here we see
why the devils trembled when Thou didst go down to Limbus, and
why they might have longed for a thousand hells still lower, that
they might escape from Thy terrible Majesty.  I see that it is
Thy will the soul should feel the greatness of Thy Majesty, and
the power of Thy most Sacred Humanity, united with Thy Divinity.
Here, too, we see what the day of judgment will be, when we shall
behold the King in His Majesty, and in the rigour of His justice
against the wicked.  Here we learn true humility, imprinted in
the soul by the sight of its own wretchedness, of which now it
cannot be ignorant.  Here, also, is confusion of face, and true
repentance for sins; for though the soul sees that our Lord shows
how He loves it, yet it knows not where to go, and so is
utterly dissolved.

14. My meaning is, that so exceedingly great is the power of this
vision, when our Lord shows the soul much of His grandeur and
majesty, that it is impossible, in my opinion, for any soul to
endure it, if our Lord did not succour it in a most supernatural
way, by throwing it into a trance or ecstasy, whereby the vision
of the divine presence is lost in the fruition thereof.  It is
true that afterwards the vision is forgotten; but there remains
so deep an impression of the majesty and beauty of God, that it
is impossible to forget it, except when our Lord is pleased that
the soul should suffer from aridity and desolation, of which I
shall speak hereafter; [8] for then it seems to forget God
Himself.  The soul is itself no longer, it is always inebriated;
it seems as if a living love of God, of the highest kind, made a
new beginning within it; for though the former vision, which I
said represented God without any likeness of Him, [9] is of a
higher kind, yet because of our weakness, in order that the
remembrance of the vision may last, and that our thoughts may be
well occupied, it is a great matter that a presence so divine
should remain and abide in our imagination. These two kinds of
visions come almost always together, and they do so come; for we
behold the excellency and beauty and glory of the most Holy
Humanity with the eyes of the soul.  And in the other way I have
spoken of,--that of intellectual vision,--we learn how He is God,
is mighty, can do all things, commands all things, governs all
things, and fills all things with His love.

15. This vision is to be esteemed very highly; nor is there, in
my opinion, any risk in it, because the fruits of it show that
the devil has no power here.  I think he tried three or four
times to represent our Lord to me, in this way, by a false image
of Him.  He takes the appearance of flesh, but he cannot
counterfeit the glory which it has when the vision is from God.
Satan makes his representations in order to undo the true vision
which the soul has had: but the soul resists instinctively; is
troubled, disgusted, and restless; it loses that devotion and joy
it previously had, and cannot pray at all.  In the beginning, it
so happened to me three or four times.  These satanic visions are
very different things; and even he who shall have attained to the
prayer of quiet only will, I believe, detect them by those
results of them which I described when I was speaking of
locutions. [10]  They are most easily recognised; and if a soul
consents not to its own delusion, I do not think that Satan will
be able to deceive it, provided it walks in humility and
singleness of heart.  He who shall have had the true vision,
coming from God, detects the false visions at once; for, though
they begin with a certain sweetness and joy, the soul rejects
them of itself; and the joy which Satan ministers must be, I
think, very different--it shows no traces of pure and holy love:
Satan very quickly betrays himself.

16. Thus, then, as I believe, Satan can do no harm to anyone who
has had experience of these things; for it is the most impossible
of all impossible things that all this may be the work of the
imagination.  There is no ground whatever for the supposition;
for the very beauty and whiteness of one of our Lord's Hands [11]
are beyond our imagination altogether.  How is it that we see
present before us, in a moment, what we do not remember, what we
have never thought of, and, moreover, what, in a long space of
time, the imagination could not compass, because, as I have just
said, [12] it far transcends anything we can comprehend in this
life?  This, then, is not possible.  Whether we have any power in
the matter or not will appear by what I am now going to say.

17. If the vision were the work of a man's own
understanding,--setting aside that such a vision would not
accomplish the great results of the true one, nor, indeed, any at
all,--it would be as the act of one who tries to go to sleep, and
yet continues awake, because sleep has not come.  He longs for
it, because of some necessity or weakness in his head: and so he
lulls himself to sleep, and makes efforts to procure it, and now
and then thinks he has succeeded; but, if the sleep be not real,
it will not support him, nor supply strength to his head: on the
contrary, his head will very often be the worse for it.  So will
it be here, in a measure; the soul will be dissipated, neither
sustained nor strengthened; on the contrary, it will be wearied
and disgusted.  But, in the true vision, the riches which abide
in the soul cannot be described; even the body receives health
and comfort.

18. I urged this argument, among others, when they told me that
my visions came from the evil one, and that I imagined them
myself,--and it was very often,--and made use of certain
illustrations, as well as I could, and as our Lord suggested to
me.  But all was to little purpose; for as there were most holy
persons in the place,--in comparison with whom I was a mass of
perdition,--whom God did not lead by this way, they were at once
filled with fear; they thought it all came through my sins.
And so my state was talked about, and came to the knowledge of
many; though I had spoken of it to no one, except my confessor,
or to those to whom he commanded [13] me to speak of it.

19. I said to them once, If they who thus speak of my state were
to tell me that a person with whom I had just conversed, and whom
I knew well, was not that person, but that I was deluding myself,
and that they knew it, I should certainly trust them rather than
my own eyes.  But if that person left with me certain
jewels,--and if, possessing none previously, I held the jewels in
my hand as pledges of a great love,--and if I were now rich,
instead of poor as before,--I should not be able to believe this
that they said, though I might wish it.  These jewels I could now
show them, for all who knew me saw clearly that my soul was
changed,--and so my confessor said; for the difference was very
great in every way--not a pretence, but such as all might most
clearly observe.  As I was formerly so wicked, I said, I could
not believe that Satan, if he wished to deceive me and take me
down to hell, would have recourse to means so adverse to his
purpose as this, of rooting out my faults, implanting virtues and
spiritual strength; for I saw clearly that I had become at once
another person through the instrumentality of these visions.

20. My confessor, who was, as I said before, [14] one of the
fathers of the Society of Jesus, and a really holy man, answered
them in the same way,--so I learnt afterwards.  He was a most
discreet man, and of great humility; but this great humility of
his brought me into serious trouble: for, though he was a man
much given to prayer, and learned, he never trusted his own
judgment, because our Lord was not leading him by this way.
He had, therefore, much to suffer on my account, in many ways.
I knew they used to say to him that he must be on his guard
against me, lest Satan should delude him through a belief in
anything I might say to him.  They gave instances of others who
were deluded. [15]  All this distressed me.  I began to be afraid
I should find no one to hear my confession, [16] and that all
would avoid me.  I did nothing but weep.

21. It was a providence of God that he was willing to stand by me
and hear my confession.  But he was so great a servant of God,
that he would have exposed himself to anything for His sake.
So he told me that if I did not offend God, nor swerve from the
instructions he gave me, there was no fear I should be deserted
by him.  He encouraged me always, and quieted me.  He bade me
never to conceal anything from him; and I never did. [17]
He used to say that, so long as I did this, the devil, if it were
the devil, could not hurt me; on the contrary, out of that evil
which Satan wished to do me, our Lord would bring forth good.
He laboured with all his might to make me perfect.  As I was very
much afraid myself, I obeyed him in everything, though
imperfectly.  He had much to suffer on my account during three
years of trouble and more, because he heard my confession all
that time; for in the great persecutions that fell upon me, and
the many harsh judgments of me which our Lord permitted,--many of
which I did not deserve,--everything was carried to him, and he
was found fault with because of me,--he being all the while
utterly blameless.

22. If he had not been so holy a man, and if our Lord had not
been with him, it would have, been impossible for him to bear so
much; for he had to answer those who regarded me as one going to
destruction; and they would not believe what he said to them.
On the other hand, he had to quiet me, and relieve me of my
fears; when my fears increased, he had again to reassure me; for,
after every vision which was strange to me, our Lord permitted me
to remain in great fear.  All this was the result of my being
then, and of having been, a sinner.  He used to console me out of
his great compassion; and, if he had trusted to his own
convictions, I should not have had so much to suffer; for God
revealed the whole truth to him.  I believe that he received this
light from the Blessed Sacrament.

23. Those servants of God who were not satisfied had many
conversations with me. [18]  As I spoke to them carelessly, so
they misunderstood my meaning in many things.  I had a great
regard for one of them; for my soul owed him more than I can
tell.  He was a most holy man, and I felt it most acutely when I
saw that he did not understand me.  He had a great desire for my
improvement, and hoped our Lord would enlighten me.  So, then,
because I spoke, as I was saying, without careful consideration,
they looked upon me as deficient in humility; and when they
detected any of my faults--they might have detected many--they
condemned me at once.  They used to put certain questions to me,
which I answered simply and carelessly.  Then they concluded
forthwith that I wished to teach them, and that I considered
myself to be a learned woman.  All this was carried to my
confessor,--for certainly they desired my amendment--and so he
would reprimand me.  This lasted some time, and I was distressed
on many sides; but, with the graces which our Lord gave me, I
bore it all.

24. I relate this in order that people may see what a great trial
it is not to find any one who knows this way of the spirit by
experience.  If our Lord had not dealt so favourably with me, I
know not what would have become of me.  There were some things
that were enough to take away my reason; and now and then I was
reduced to such straits that I could do nothing but lift up my
eyes to our Lord. [19]  The contradiction of good people, which a
wretched woman, weak, wicked, and timid as I am, must bear with,
seems to be nothing when thus described; but I, who in the course
of my life passed through very great trials, found this one of
the heaviest. [20]

25. May our Lord grant that I may have pleased His Majesty a
little herein; for I am sure that they pleased Him who condemned
and rebuked me, and that it was all for my great good.

Chapter XXIX.


Of Visions.  The Graces Our Lord Bestowed on the Saint.
The Answers Our Lord Gave Her for Those Who Tried Her.


1. I have wandered far from the subject; for I undertook to
give reasons why the vision was no work of the imagination.
For how can we, by any efforts of ours, picture to ourselves the
Humanity of Christ, and imagine His great beauty?  No little time
is necessary, if our conception is in any way to resemble it.
Certainly, the imagination may be able to picture it, and a
person may for a time contemplate that picture,--the form and the
brightness of it,--and gradually make it more perfect, and so lay
up that image in his memory.  Who can hinder this, seeing that it
could be fashioned by the understanding?  But as to the vision of
which I am speaking, there are no means of bringing it about;
only we must behold it when our Lord is pleased to present it
before us, as He wills and what He wills; and there is no
possibility of taking anything away from it, or of adding
anything to it; nor is there any way of effecting it, whatever we
may do, nor of seeing it when we like, nor of abstaining from
seeing; if we try to gaze upon it--part of the vision in
particular--the vision of Christ is lost at once.

2. For two years and a half God granted me this grace very
frequently; but it is now more than three years since He has
taken away from me its continual presence, through another of a
higher nature, as I shall perhaps explain hereafter. [1]
And though I saw Him speaking to me, and though I was
contemplating His great beauty, and the sweetness with which
those words of His came forth from His divine mouth,--they were
sometimes uttered with severity,--and though I was extremely
desirous to behold the colour of His eyes, or the form of them,
so that I might be able to describe them, yet I never attained to
the sight of them, and I could do nothing for that end; on the
contrary, I lost the vision altogether.  And though I see that He
looks upon me at times with great tenderness, yet so strong is
His gaze, that my soul cannot endure it; I fall into a trance so
deep, that I lose the beautiful vision, in order to have a
greater fruition of it all.

3. Accordingly, willing or not willing, the vision has
nothing to do with it.  Our Lord clearly regards nothing but
humility and confusion of face, the acceptance of what He wishes
to give, and the praise of Himself, the Giver.  This is true of
all visions without exception: we can contribute nothing towards
them--we cannot add to them, nor can we take from them; our own
efforts can neither make nor unmake them.  Our Lord would have us
see most clearly that it is no work of ours, but of His Divine
Majesty; we are therefore the less able to be proud of it: on the
contrary, it makes us humble and afraid; for we see that, as our
Lord can take from us the power of seeing what we would see, so
also can He take from us these mercies and His grace, and we may
be lost for ever.  We must therefore walk in His fear while we
are living in this our exile.

4. Our Lord showed Himself to me almost always as He is
after His resurrection.  It was the same in the Host; only at
those times when I was in trouble, and when it was His will to
strengthen me, did He show His wounds.  Sometimes I saw Him on
the cross, in the Garden, crowned with thorns,--but that was
rarely; sometimes also carrying His cross because of my
necessities,--I may say so,--or those of others; but always in
His glorified body.  Many reproaches and many vexations have I
borne while telling this--many suspicions and much persecution
also.  So certain were they to whom I spoke that I had an evil
spirit, that some would have me exorcised.  I did not care much
for this; but I felt it bitterly when I saw that my confessors
were afraid to hear me, or when I knew that they were told of
anything about me.

5. Notwithstanding all this, I never could be sorry that I
had had these heavenly visions; nor would I exchange even one of
them for all the wealth and all the pleasures of the world.
I always regarded them as a great mercy from our Lord; and to me
they were the very greatest treasure,--of this our Lord assured
me often.  I used to go to Him to complain of all these
hardships; and I came away from prayer consoled, and with renewed
strength.  I did not dare to contradict those who were trying me;
for I saw that it made matters worse, because they looked on my
doing so as a failure in humility.  I spoke of it to my
confessor; he always consoled me greatly when he saw me
in distress.

6. As my visions grew in frequency, one of those who used to
help me before--it was to him I confessed when the
father-minister [2] could not hear me--began to say that I was
certainly under the influence of Satan.  He bade me, now that I
had no power of resisting, always to make the sign of the cross
when I had a vision, to point my finger at it by way of
scorn, [3] and be firmly persuaded of its diabolic nature.  If I
did this, the vision would not recur.  I was to be without fear
on the point; God would watch over me, and take the vision
away. [4]  This was a great hardship for me; for, as I could not
believe that the vision did not come from God, it was a fearful
thing for me to do; and I could not wish, as I said before, that
the visions should be withheld.  However, I did at last as I was
bidden.  I prayed much to our Lord, that He would deliver me from
delusions. I was always praying to that effect, and with many
tears.  I had recourse also to St. Peter and St. Paul; for our
Lord had said to me--it was on their feast that He had appeared
to me the first time [5]--that they would preserve me from
delusion.  I used to see them frequently most distinctly on my
left hand; but that vision was not imaginary.  These glorious
Saints were my very good lords.

7. It was to me a most painful thing to make a show of
contempt whenever I saw our Lord in a vision; for when I saw Him
before me, if I were to be cut in pieces, I could not believe it
was Satan.  This was to me, therefore, a heavy kind of penance;
and accordingly, that I might not be so continually crossing
myself, I used to hold a crucifix in my hand.  This I did almost
always; but I did not always make signs of contempt, because I
felt that too much.  It reminded me of the insults which the Jews
heaped upon Him; and so I prayed Him to forgive me, seeing that I
did so in obedience to him who stood in His stead, and not to lay
the blame on me, seeing that he was one of those whom He had
placed as His ministers in His Church.  He said to me that I was
not to distress myself--that I did well to obey; but He would
make them see the truth of the matter.  He seemed to me to be
angry when they made me give up my prayer. [6]  He told me to say
to them that this was tyranny.  He gave me reasons for believing
that the vision was not satanic; some of them I mean to repeat by
and by.

8. On one occasion,when I was holding in my hand the cross
of my rosary, He took it from me into His own hand.  He returned
it; but it was then four large stones incomparably more precious
than diamonds; for nothing can be compared with what is
supernatural.  Diamonds seem counterfeits and imperfect when
compared with these precious stones.  The five wounds were
delineated on them with most admirable art.  He said to me, that
for the future that cross would appear so to me always; and so it
did.  I never saw the wood of which it was made, but only the
precious stones.  They were seen, however, by no one else,--only
by myself. [7]

9. When they had begun to insist on my putting my visions to
a test like this, and resisting them, the graces I received were
multiplied more and more.  I tried to distract myself; I never
ceased to be in prayer: even during sleep my prayer seemed to be
continual; for now my love grew, I made piteous complaints to our
Lord, and told Him I could not bear it.  Neither was it in my
power--though I desired, and, more than that, even strove--to
give up thinking of Him.  Nevertheless, I obeyed to the utmost of
my power; but my power was little or nothing in the matter; and
our Lord never released me from that obedience; but though He
bade me obey my confessor, He reassured me in another way, and
taught me what I was to say.  He has continued to do so until
now; and He gave me reasons so sufficient, that I felt myself
perfectly safe.

10. Not long afterwards His Majesty began, according to His
promise, to make it clear that it was He Himself who appeared, by
the growth in me of the love of God so strong, that I knew not
who could have infused it; for it was most supernatural, and I
had not attained to it by any efforts of my own.  I saw myself
dying with a desire to see God, and I knew not how to seek that
life otherwise than by dying.  Certain great impetuosities [8] of
love, though not so intolerable as those of which I have spoken
before, [9] nor yet of so great worth, overwhelmed me.  I knew
not what to do; for nothing gave me pleasure, and I had no
control over myself.  It seemed as if my soul were really torn
away from myself.  Oh, supreme artifice of our Lord! how tenderly
didst Thou deal with Thy miserable slave!  Thou didst hide
Thyself from me, and didst yet constrain me with Thy love, with a
death so sweet, that my soul would never wish it over.

11. It is not possible for any one to understand these
impetuosities if he has not experienced them himself.  They are
not an upheaving of the breast, nor those devotional sensations,
not uncommon, which seem on the point of causing suffocation, and
are beyond control.  That prayer is of a much lower order; and
those agitations should be avoided by gently endeavouring to be
recollected; and the soul should be kept in quiet.  This prayer
is like the sobbing of little children, who seem on the point of
choking, and whose disordered senses are soothed by giving them
to drink.  So here reason should draw in the reins, because
nature itself may be contributing to it and we should consider
with fear that all this may not be perfect, and that much
sensuality may be involved in it.  The infant soul should be
soothed by the caresses of love, which shall draw forth its love
in a gentle way, and not, as they say, by force of blows.
This love should be inwardly under control, and not as a caldron,
fiercely boiling because too much fuel has been applied to it,
and out of which everything is lost.  The source of the fire must
be kept under control, and the flame must be quenched in sweet
tears, and not with those painful tears which come out of these
emotions, and which do so much harm.

12. In the beginning, I had tears of this kind.  They left
me with a disordered head and a wearied spirit, and for a day or
two afterwards unable to resume my prayer.  Great discretion,
therefore, is necessary at first, in order that everything may
proceed gently, and that the operations of the spirit may be
within; all outward manifestations should be carefully avoided.

13. These other impetuosities are very different.  It is not
we who apply the fuel; the fire is already kindled, and we are
thrown into it in a moment to be consumed.  It is by no efforts
of the soul that it sorrows over the wound which the absence of
our Lord has inflicted on it; it is far otherwise; for an arrow
is driven into the entrails to the very quick, [10] and into the
heart at times, so that the soul knows not what is the matter
with it, nor what it wishes for.  It understands clearly enough
that it wishes for God, and that the arrow seems tempered with
some herb which makes the soul hate itself for the love of our
Lord, and willingly lose its life for Him.  It is impossible to
describe or explain the way in which God wounds the soul, nor the
very grievous pain inflicted, which deprives it of all
self-consciousness; yet this pain is so sweet, that there is no
joy in the world which gives greater delight.  As I have just
said, [11] the soul would wish to be always dying of this wound.

14. This pain and bliss together carried me out of myself,
and I never could understand how it was.  Oh, what a sight a
wounded soul is!--a soul, I mean, so conscious of it, as to be
able to say of itself that it is wounded for so good a cause; and
seeing distinctly that it never did anything whereby this love
should come to it, and that it does come from that exceeding love
which our Lord bears it.  A spark seems to have fallen suddenly
upon it, that has set it all on fire.  Oh, how often do I
remember, when in this state, those words of David: "Quemadmodum
desiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum"! [12] They seem to me to be
literally true of myself.

15. When these impetuosities are not very violent they seem
to admit of a little mitigation--at least, the soul seeks some
relief, because it knows not what to do--through certain
penances; the painfulness of which, and even the shedding of its
blood, are no more felt than if the body were dead.  The soul
seeks for ways and means to do something that may be felt, for
the love of God; but the first pain is so great, that no bodily
torture I know of can take it away.  As relief is not to be had
here, these medicines are too mean for so high a disease.
Some slight mitigation may be had, and the pain may pass away a
little, by praying God to relieve its sufferings: but the soul
sees no relief except in death, by which it thinks to attain
completely to the fruition of its good.  At other times, these
impetuosities are so violent, that the soul can do neither this
nor anything else; the whole body is contracted, and neither hand
nor foot can be moved: if the body be upright at the time, it
falls down, as a thing that has no control over itself.
It cannot even breathe; all it does is to moan--not loudly,
because it cannot: its moaning, however, comes from a keen sense
of pain.

16. Our Lord was pleased that I should have at times a
vision of this kind: I saw an angel close by me, on my left side,
in bodily form.  This I am not accustomed to see, unless very
rarely.  Though I have visions of angels frequently, yet I see
them only by an intellectual vision, such as I have spoken of
before. [13]  It was our Lord's will that in this vision I should
see the angel in this wise.  He was not large, but small of
stature, and most beautiful--his face burning, as if he were one
of the highest angels, who seem to be all of fire: they must be
those whom we call cherubim. [14]  Their names they never tell
me; but I see very well that there is in heaven so great a
difference between one angel and another, and between these and
the others, that I cannot explain it.

17. I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the
iron's point there seemed to be a little fire.  He appeared to me
to be thrusting it at times into my heart, [15] and to pierce my
very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out
also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God.
The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so
surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could
not wish to be rid of it.  The soul is satisfied now with nothing
less than God.  The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the
body has its share in it, even a large one.  It is a caressing of
love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God,
that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may
think that I am lying. [16]

18. During the days that this lasted, I went about as if
beside myself.  I wished to see, or speak with, no one, but only
to cherish my pain, which was to me a greater bliss than all
created things could give me. [17]

19. I was in this state from time to time, whenever it was
our Lord's pleasure to throw me into those deep trances, which I
could not prevent even when I was in the company of others, and
which, to my deep vexation, came to be publicly known.
Since then, I do not feel that pain so much, but only that which
I spoke of before,--I do not remember the chapter, [18]--which is
in many ways very different from it, and of greater worth.
On the other hand, when this pain, of which I am now speaking,
begins, our Lord seems to lay hold of the soul, and to throw it
into a trance, so that there is no time for me to have any sense
of pain or suffering, because fruition ensues at once.  May He be
blessed for ever, who hath bestowed such great graces on one who
has responded so ill to blessings so great!

Chapter XXX.


St. Peter of Alcantara Comforts the Saint.  Great Temptations and
Interior Trials.


1. When I saw that I was able to do little or nothing towards
avoiding these great impetuosities, I began also to be afraid of
them, because I could not understand how this pain and joy could
subsist together.  I knew it was possible enough for bodily pain
and spiritual joy to dwell together; but the coexistence of a
spiritual pain so excessive as this, and of joy so deep, troubled
my understanding.  Still, I tried to continue my resistance; but
I was so little able, that I was now and then wearied.  I used to
take up the cross for protection, and try to defend myself
against Him who, by the cross, is the Protector of us all.  I saw
that no one understood me.  I saw it very clearly myself, but I
did not dare to say so to any one except my confessor; for that
would have been a real admission that I had no humility.

2. Our Lord was pleased to succour me in a great measure,--and,
for the moment, altogether,--by bringing to the place where I was
that blessed friar, Peter of Alcantara.  Of him I spoke before,
and said something of his penance. [1]  Among other things, I
have been assured that he wore continually, for twenty years, a
girdle made of iron. [2]  He is the author of certain little
books, in Spanish, on prayer, which are now in common use; for,
as he was much exercised therein, his writings are very
profitable to those who are given to prayer.  He kept the first
rule of the blessed St. Francis in all its rigour, and did those
things besides of which I spoke before.

3. When that widow, the servant of God and my friend, of whom I
have already spoken, [3] knew that so great a man had come, she
took her measures.  She knew the straits I was in, for she was an
eye-witness of my afflictions, and was a great comfort to me.
Her faith was so strong, that she could not help believing that
what others said was the work of the devil was really the work of
the Spirit of God; and as she is a person of great sense and
great caution, and one to whom our Lord is very bountiful in
prayer, it pleased His Majesty to let her see what learned men
failed to discern.  My confessors gave me leave to accept relief
in some things from her, because in many ways she was able to
afford it.  Some of those graces which our Lord bestowed on me
fell to her lot occasionally, together with instructions most
profitable for her soul.  So, then, when she knew that the
blessed man was come, without saying a word to me, she obtained
leave from the Provincial for me to stay eight days in her house,
in order that I might the more easily confer with him.  In that
house, and in one church or another, I had many conversations
with him the first time he came here; for, afterwards, I had many
communications with him at diverse times.

4. I gave him an account, as briefly as I could, of my life, and
of my way of prayer, with the utmost clearness in my power.
I have always held to this, to be perfectly frank and exact with
those to whom I make known the state of my soul. [4]  Even my
first impulses I wish them to know; and as for doubtful and
suspicious matters, I used to make the most of them by arguing
against myself.  Thus, then, without equivocation or concealment,
I laid before him the state of my soul.  I saw almost at once
that he understood me, by reason of his own experience.  That was
all I required; for at that time I did not know myself as I do
now,so as to give an account of my state.  It was at a later time
that God enabled me to understand myself, and describe the graces
which His Majesty bestows upon me.  It was necessary, then, that
he who would clearly understand and explain my state should have
had experience of it himself.

5. The light he threw on the matter was of the clearest; for as
to these visions, at least, which were not imaginary, I could not
understand how they could be.  And it seemed that I could not
understand, too, how those could be which I saw with the eyes of
the soul; for, as I said before, [5] those visions only seemed to
me to be of consequence which were seen with the bodily eyes: and
of these I had none.  The holy man enlightened me on the whole
question, explained it to me, and bade me not to be distressed,
but to praise God, and to abide in the full conviction that this
was the work of the Spirit of God; for, saving the faith, nothing
could be more true, and there was nothing on which I could more
firmly rely.  He was greatly comforted in me, was most kind and
serviceable, and ever afterwards took great care of me, and told
me of his own affairs and labours; and when he saw that I had
those very desires which in himself were fulfilled already,--for
our Lord had given me very strong desires,--and also how great my
resolution was, he delighted in conversing with me.

6. To a person whom our Lord has raised to this state, there is
no pleasure or comfort equal to that of meeting with another whom
our Lord has begun to raise in the same way.  At that time,
however, it must have been only a beginning with me, as I
believe; and God grant I may not have gone back now.  He was
extremely sorry for me.  He told me that one of the greatest
trials in this world was that which I had borne,--namely, the
contradiction of good people, [6]--and that more was in reserve
for me: I had need, therefore, of some one--and there was no one
in this city--who understood me; but he would speak to my
confessor, and to that married nobleman, already spoken of, [7]
who was one of those who tormented me most, and who, because of
his great affection for me, was the cause of all these attacks.
He was a holy but timid man, and could not feel safe about me,
because he had seen how wicked I was, and that not long before.
The holy man did so; he spoke to them both, explained the matter,
and gave them reasons why they should reassure themselves, and
disturb me no more.  My confessor was easily satisfied,--not so
the nobleman; for though they were not enough to keep him quiet,
yet they kept him in some measure from frightening me so much as
he used to do.

7. We made an agreement that I should write to him and tell him
how it fared with me, for the future, and that we should pray
much for each other.  Such was his humility, that he held to the
prayers of a wretch like me.  It made me very much ashamed of
myself.  He left me in the greatest consolation and joy, bidding
me continue my prayer with confidence, and without any doubt that
it was the work of God.  If I should have any doubts, for my
greater security, I was to make them known to my confessor, and,
having done so, be in peace.  Nevertheless, I was not able at all
to feel that confidence, for our Lord was leading me by the way
of fear; and so, when they told me that the devil had power over
me, I believed them.  Thus, then, not one of them was able to
inspire me with confidence on the one hand, or fear on the other,
in such a way as to make me believe either of them, otherwise
than as our Lord allowed me.  Accordingly, though the holy friar
consoled and calmed me, I did not rely so much on him as to be
altogether without fear, particularly when our Lord forsook me in
the afflictions of my soul, of which I will now speak.
Nevertheless, as I have said, I was very much consoled.

8. I could not give thanks enough to God, and to my glorious
father St. Joseph, who seemed to me to have brought him here.
He was the commissary-general of the custody [8] of St. Joseph,
to whom, and to our Lady, I used to pray much.

9. I suffered at times--and even still, though not so often--the
most grievous trials, together with bodily pains and afflictions
arising from violent sicknesses; so much so, that I could
scarcely control myself.  At other times, my bodily sickness was
more grievous; and as I had no spiritual pain, I bore it with
great joy: but, when both pains came upon me together, my
distress was so heavy, that I was reduced to sore straits.

10. I forgot all the mercies our Lord had shown me, and
remembered them only as a dream, to my great distress; for my
understanding was so dull, that I had a thousand doubts and
suspicions whether I had ever understood matters aright, thinking
that perhaps all was fancy, and that it was enough for me to have
deceived myself, without also deceiving good men.  I looked upon
myself as so wicked as to have been the cause, by my sins, of all
the evils and all the heresies that had sprung up.  This is but a
false humility, and Satan invented it for the purpose of
disquieting me, and trying whether he could thereby drive my soul
to despair.  I have now had so much experience, that I know this
was his work; so he, seeing that I understand him, does not
torment me in the same way as much as he used to do.  That it is
his work is clear from the restlessness and discomfort with which
it begins, and the trouble it causes in the soul while it lasts;
from the obscurity and distress, the aridity and indisposition
for prayer and for every good work, which it produces.  It seems
to stifle the soul and trammel the body, so as to make them good
for nothing.

11. Now, though the soul acknowledges itself to be miserable, and
though it is painful to us to see ourselves as we are, and though
we have most deep convictions of our own wickedness,--deep as
those spoken of just now, [9] and really felt,--yet true humility
is not attended with trouble; it does not disturb the soul; it
causes neither obscurity nor aridity: on the contrary, it
consoles.  It is altogether different, bringing with it calm,
sweetness, and light.  It is no doubt painful; but, on the other
hand, it is consoling, because we see how great is the mercy of
our Lord in allowing the soul to have that pain, and how well the
soul is occupied.  On the one hand, the soul grieves over its
offences against God; on the other, His compassion makes it glad.
It has light, which makes it ashamed of itself; and it gives
thanks to His Majesty, who has borne with it so long.  That other
humility, which is the work of Satan, furnishes no light for any
good work; it pictures God as bringing upon everything fire and
sword; it dwells upon His justice; and the soul's faith in the
mercy of God--for the power of the devil does not reach so far as
to destroy faith--is of such a nature as to give me no
consolation: on the contrary, the consideration of mercies so
great helps to increase the pain, because I look upon myself as
bound to render greater service.

12. This invention of Satan is one of the most painful, subtle,
and crafty that I have known him to possess; I should therefore
like to warn you, my father, of it, in order that, if Satan
should tempt you herein, you may have some light, and be aware of
his devices, if your understanding should be left at liberty:
because you must not suppose that learning and knowledge are of
any use here; for though I have none of them myself, yet now that
I have escaped out of his hands I see clearly that this is folly.
What I understood by it is this: that it is our Lord's pleasure
to give him leave and license, as He gave him of old to tempt
Job; [10] though in my case, because of my wretchedness, the
temptation is not so sharp.

13. It happened to me to be tempted once in this way; and I
remember it was on the day before the vigil of Corpus Christi,--a
feast to which I have great devotion, though not so great as I
ought to have.  The trial then lasted only till the day of the
feast itself.  But, on other occasions, it continued one, two,
and even three weeks and--I know not--perhaps longer.  But I was
specially liable to it during the Holy Weeks, when it was my
habit to make prayer my joy.  Then the devil seizes on my
understanding in a moment; and occasionally, by means of things
so trivial that I should laugh at them at any other time, he
makes it stumble over anything he likes.  The soul, laid in
fetters, loses all control over itself, and all power of thinking
of anything but the absurdities he puts before it, which, being
more or less unsubstantial, inconsistent, and disconnected, serve
only to stifle the soul, so that it has no power over itself; and
accordingly--so it seems to me--the devils make a football of it,
and the soul is unable to escape out of their hands.  It is
impossible to describe the sufferings of the soul in this state.
It goes about in quest of relief, and God suffers it to find
none.  The light of reason, in the freedom of its will, remains,
but it is not clear; it seems to me as if its eyes were covered
with a veil.  As a person who, having travelled often by a
particular road, knows, though it be night and dark, by his past
experience of it, where he may stumble, and where he ought to be
on his guard against that risk, because he has seen the place by
day, so the soul avoids offending God: it seems to go on by
habit--that is, if we put out of sight the fact that our Lord
holds it by the hand, which is the true explanation of
the matter.

14. Faith is then as dead, and asleep, like all the other
virtues; not lost, however,--for the soul truly believes all that
the church holds; but its profession of the faith is hardly more
than an outward profession of the mouth.  And, on the other hand,
temptations seem to press it down, and make it dull, so that its
knowledge of God becomes to it as that of something which it
hears of far away.  So tepid is its love that, when it hears God
spoken of, it listens and believes that He is what He is, because
the Church so teaches; but it recollects nothing of its own
former experience.  Vocal prayer or solitude is only a greater
affliction, because the interior suffering--whence it comes, it
knows not--is unendurable, and, as it seems to me, in some
measure a counterpart of hell.  So it is, as our Lord showed me
in a vision; [11] for the soul itself is then burning in the
fire, knowing not who has kindled it, nor whence it comes, nor
how to escape it, nor how to put it out: if it seeks relief from
the fire by spiritual reading, it cannot find any, just as if it
could not read at all.  On one occasion, it occurred to me to
read a life of a Saint, that I might forget myself, and be
refreshed with the recital of what he had suffered.  Four or five
times, I read as many lines; and, though they were written in
Spanish, I understood them less at the end than I did when I
began: so I gave it up.  It so happened to me on more occasions
than one, but I have a more distinct recollection of this.

15. To converse with any one is worse, for the devil then sends
so offensive a spirit of bad temper, that I think I could eat
people up; nor can I help myself.  I feel that I do something
when I keep myself under control; or rather our Lord does so,
when He holds back with His hand any one in this state from
saying or doing something that may be hurtful to his neighbours
and offensive to God.  Then, as to going to our confessor, that
is of no use; for the certain result is--and very often has it
happened to me--what I shall now describe.  Though my confessors,
with whom I had to do then, and have to do still, are so holy,
they spoke to me and reproved me with such harshness, that they
were astonished at it afterwards when I told them of it.
They said that they could not help themselves; for, though they
had resolved not to use such language, and though they pitied me
also very much,--yea, even had scruples on the subject, because
of my grievous trials of soul and body,--and were, moreover,
determined to console me, they could not refrain.  They did not
use unbecoming words--I mean, words offensive to God; yet their
words were the most offensive that could be borne with in
confession. They must have aimed at mortifying me.  At other
times, I used to delight in this, and was prepared to bear it;
but it was then a torment altogether.  I used to think, too, that
I deceived them; so I went to them, and cautioned them very
earnestly to be on their guard against me, for it might be that I
deceived them.  I saw well enough that I would not do so
advisedly, nor tell them an untruth; [12] but everything made me
afraid.  One of them, on one occasion, when he had heard me speak
of this temptation, told me not to distress myself; for, even if
I wished to deceive him, he had sense enough not to be deceived.
This gave me great comfort.

16. Sometimes, almost always,--at least, very frequently,--I used
to find rest after Communion; now and then, even, as I drew near
to the most Holy Sacrament, all at once my soul and body would be
so well, that I was amazed. [13]  It seemed to be nothing else but
an instantaneous dispersion of the darkness that covered my soul:
when the sun rose, I saw how silly I had been.

17. On other occasions, if our Lord spoke to me but one word,
saying only, "Be not distressed, have no fear,"--as I said
before, [14]--I was made whole at once; or, if I saw a vision, I
was as if I had never been amiss.  I rejoiced in God, and made my
complaint to Him, because He permitted me to undergo such
afflictions; yet the recompense was great; for almost always,
afterwards, His mercies descended upon me in great abundance.
The soul seemed to come forth as gold out of the crucible, most
refined, and made glorious to behold, our Lord dwelling within
it.  These trials afterwards are light, though they once seemed
to be unendurable; and the soul longs to undergo them again, if
that be more pleasing to our Lord.  And though trials and
persecutions increase, yet, if we bear them without offending our
Lord, rejoicing in suffering for His sake, it will be all the
greater gain: I, however, do not bear them as they ought to be
borne, but rather in a most imperfect way.  At other times, my
trials came upon me--they come still--in another form; and then
it seems to me as if the very possibility of thinking a good
thought, or desiring the accomplishment of it, were utterly taken
from me: both soul and body are altogether useless and a heavy
burden.  However, when I am in this state, I do not suffer from
the other temptations and disquietudes, but only from a certain
loathing of I know not what, and my soul finds pleasure
in nothing.

18. I used to try exterior good works, in order to occupy myself
partly by violence; and I know well how weak a soul is when grace
is hiding itself.  It did not distress me much, because the sight
of my own meanness gave me some satisfaction. On other occasions,
I find myself unable to pray or to fix my thoughts with any
distinctness upon God, or anything that is good, though I may be
alone; but I have a sense that I know Him. It is the
understanding and the imagination, I believe, which hurt me here;
for it seems to me that I have a good will, disposed for all
good; but the understanding is so lost, that it seems to be
nothing else but a raving lunatic, which nobody can restrain, and
of which I am not mistress enough to keep it quiet for
a minute. [15]

19. Sometimes I laugh at myself, and recognise my wretchedness: I
watch my understanding, and leave it alone to see what it will
do.  Glory be to God, for a wonder, it never runs on what is
wrong, but only on indifferent things, considering what is going
on here, or there, or elsewhere.  I see then, more and more, the
exceeding great mercy of our Lord to me, when He keeps this
lunatic bound in the chains of perfect contemplation.  I wonder
what would happen if those people who think I am good knew of my
extravagance.  I am very sorry when I see my soul in such bad
company; I long to see it delivered therefrom, and so I say to
our Lord: When, O my God, shall I see my whole soul praising
Thee, that it may have the fruition of Thee in all its faculties?
Let me be no longer, O Lord, thus torn to pieces, and every one
of them, as it were, running in a different direction.  This has
been often the case with me, but I think that my scanty bodily
health was now and then enough to bring it about.

20. I dwell much on the harm which original sin has done us; that
is, I believe, what has rendered us incapable of the fruition of
so great a good.  My sins, too, must be in fault; for, if I had
not committed so many, I should have been more perfect in
goodness.  Another great affliction which I suffered was this:
all the books which I read on the subject of prayer, I thought I
understood thoroughly, and that I required them no longer,
because our Lord had given me the gift of prayer.  I therefore
ceased to read those books, and applied myself to lives of
Saints, thinking that this would improve me and give me courage;
for I found myself very defective in every kind of service which
the Saints rendered unto God.  Then it struck me that I had very
little humility, when I could think that I had attained to this
degree of prayer; and so, when I could not come to any other
conclusion, I was greatly distressed, until certain learned
persons, and the blessed friar, Peter of Alcantara, told me not
to trouble myself about the matter.

21. I see clearly enough that I have not yet begun to serve God,
though He showers down upon me those very graces which He gives
to many good people.  I am a mass of imperfection, except in
desire and in love; for herein I see well that our Lord has been
gracious to me, in order that I may please Him in some measure.
I really think that I love Him; but my conduct, and the many
imperfections I discern in myself, make me sad.

22. My soul, also, is subject occasionally to a certain
foolishness,--that is the right name to give it,--when I seem to
be doing neither good nor evil, but following in the wake of
others, as they say, without pain or pleasure, indifferent to
life and death, pleasure and pain.  I seem to have no feeling.
The soul seems to me like a little ass, which feeds and thrives,
because it accepts the food which is given it, and eats it
without reflection.  The soul in this state must be feeding on
some great mercies of God, seeing that its miserable life is no
burden to it, and that it bears it patiently but it is conscious
of no sensible movements or results, whereby it may ascertain the
state it is in.

23. It seems to me now like sailing with a very gentle wind, when
one makes much way without knowing how; for in the other states,
so great are the effects, that the soul sees almost at once an
improvement in itself, because the desires instantly are on fire,
and the soul is never satisfied.  This comes from those great
impetuosities of love, spoken of before, [16] in those to whom
God grants them.  It is like those little wells I have seen
flowing, wherein the upheaving of the sand never ceases.
This illustration and comparison seem to me to be a true
description of those souls who attain to this state; their love
is ever active, thinking what it may do; it cannot contain
itself, as the water remains not in the earth, but is continually
welling upwards.  So is the soul, in general; it is not at rest,
nor can it contain itself, because of the love it has: it is so
saturated therewith, that it would have others drink of it,
because there is more than enough for itself, in order that they
might help it to praise God.

24. I call to remembrance--oh, how often!--that living water of
which our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman.  That Gospel [17]
has a great attraction for me; and, indeed, so it had even when I
was a little child, though I did not understand it then as I do
now. I used to pray much to our Lord for that living water; and I
had always a picture of it, representing our Lord at the well,
with this inscription, "Domine, da mihi aquam." [18]

25. This love is also like a great fire, which requires fuel
continually, in order that it may not burn out.  So those souls I
am speaking of, however much it may cost them, will always bring
fuel, in order that the fire may not be quenched.  As for me, I
should be glad, considering what I am, if I had but straw even to
throw upon it.  And so it is with me occasionally--and, indeed,
very often.  At one time, I laugh at myself; and at another, I am
very much distressed.  The inward stirring of my love urges me to
do something for the service of God; and I am not able to do more
than adorn images with boughs and flowers, clean or arrange an
oratory, or some such trifling acts, so that I am ashamed of
myself.  If I undertook any penitential practice, the whole was
so slight, and was done in such a way, that if our Lord did not
accept my good will, I saw it was all worthless, and so I laughed
at myself.  The failure of bodily strength, sufficient to do
something for God, is no light affliction for those souls to whom
He, in His goodness, has communicated this fire of His love in
its fulness.  It is a very good penance; for when souls are not
strong enough to heap fuel on this fire, and die of fear that the
fire may go out, it seems to me that they become fuel themselves,
are reduced to ashes, or dissolved in tears, and burn away: and
this is suffering enough, though it be sweet.

26. Let him, then, praise our Lord exceedingly, who has attained
to this state; who has received the bodily strength requisite for
penance; who has learning, ability, and power to preach, to hear
confessions, and to draw souls unto God.  Such a one neither
knows nor comprehends the blessing he possesses, unless he knows
by experience what it is to be powerless to serve God in
anything, and at the same time to be receiving much from Him.
May He be blessed for ever, and may the angels glorify
Him!  Amen.

27. I know not if I do well to write so much in detail.  But as
you, my father, bade me again not to be troubled by the
minuteness of my account, nor to omit anything, I go on
recounting clearly and truly all I can call to mind.  But I must
omit much; for if I did not, I should have to spend more
time--and, as I said before, [19] I have so little to spend, and
perhaps, after all, nothing will be gained.

Chapter XXXI.


Of Certain Outward Temptations and Appearances of Satan.  Of the
Sufferings Thereby Occasioned.  Counsels for Those Who Go on

Unto Perfection.

1. Now that I have described certain temptations and troubles,
interior and secret, of which Satan was the cause, I will speak
of others which he wrought almost in public, and in which his
presence could not be ignored. [1]

2. I was once in an oratory, when Satan, in an abominable shape,
appeared on my left hand.  I looked at his mouth in particular,
because he spoke, and it was horrible.  A huge flame seemed to
issue out of his body, perfectly bright, without any shadow.
He spoke in a fearful way, and said to me that, though I had
escaped out of his hands, he would yet lay hold of me again.
I was in great terror, made the sign of the cross as well as I
could, and then the form vanished--but it reappeared instantly.
This occurred twice; I did not know what to do; there was some
holy water at hand; I took some, and threw it in the direction of
the figure, and then Satan never returned.

3. On another occasion, I was tortured for five hours with such
terrible pains, such inward and outward sufferings, that it
seemed to me as if I could not bear them.  Those who were with me
were frightened; they knew not what to do, and I could not help
myself.  I am in the habit, when these pains and my bodily
suffering are most unendurable, to make interior acts as well as
I can, imploring our Lord, if it be His will, to give me
patience, and then to let me suffer on, even to the end of the
world.  So, when I found myself suffering so cruelly, I relieved
myself by making those acts and resolutions, in order that I
might be able to endure the pain.  It pleased our Lord to let me
understand that it was the work of Satan; for I saw close beside
me a most frightful little negro, gnashing his teeth in despair
at losing what he attempted to seize.  When I saw him, I laughed,
and had no fear; for there were some then present who were
helpless, and knew of no means whereby so great a pain could be
relieved.  My body, head, and arms were violently shaken; I could
not help myself: but the worst of all was the interior pain, for
I could find no ease in any way.  Nor did I dare to ask for holy
water, lest those who were with me should be afraid, and find out
what the matter really was.

4. I know by frequent experience that there is nothing which puts
the devils to flight like holy water.  They run away before the
sign of the cross also, but they return immediately: great, then,
must be the power of holy water.  As for me, my soul is conscious
of a special and most distinct consolation whenever I take it.
Indeed, I feel almost always a certain refreshing, which I cannot
describe, together with an inward joy, which comforts my whole
soul.  This is no fancy, nor a thing which has occurred once
only; for it has happened very often, and I have watched it very
carefully.  I may compare what I feel with that which happens to
a person in great heat, and very thirsty, drinking a cup of cold
water--his whole being is refreshed.  I consider that everything
ordained by the Church is very important; and I have a joy in
reflecting that the words of the Church are so mighty, that they
endow water with power, so that there shall be so great a
difference between holy water and water that has never been
blessed.  Then, as my pains did not cease, I told them, if they
would not laugh, I would ask for some holy water.  They brought
me some, and sprinkled me with it; but I was no better.  I then
threw some myself in the direction of the negro, when he fled in
a moment.  All my sufferings ceased, just as if some one had
taken them from me with his hand; only I was wearied, as if I had
been beaten with many blows.  It was of great service to me to
learn that if, by our Lord's permission, Satan can do so much
evil to a soul and body not in his power, he can do much more
when he has them in his possession.  It gave me a renewed desire
to be delivered from a fellowship so dangerous.

5. Another time, and not long ago, the same thing happened to me,
though it did not last so long, and I was alone at the moment.
I asked for holy water; and they who came in after the devil had
gone away,--they were two nuns, worthy of all credit, and would
not tell a lie for anything,--perceived a most offensive smell,
like that of brimstone.  I smelt nothing myself; but the odour
lasted long enough to become sensible to them.

6. On another occasion, I was in choir, when, in a moment, I
became profoundly recollected.  I went out in order that the
sisters might know nothing of it; yet those who were near heard
the sound of heavy blows where I was, and I heard voices myself,
as of persons in consultation, but I did not hear what they said:
I was so absorbed in prayer that I understood nothing, neither
was I at all afraid.  This took place almost always when our Lord
was pleased that some soul or other, persuaded by me, advanced in
the spiritual life.  Certainly, what I am now about to describe
happened to me once; there are witnesses to testify to it,
particularly my present confessor, for he saw the account in a
letter.  I did not tell him from whom the letter came, but he
knew perfectly who the person was.

7. There came to me a person who, for two years and a half, had
been living in mortal sin of the most abominable nature I ever
heard.  During the whole of that time, he neither confessed it
nor ceased from it; and yet he said Mass.  He confessed his other
sins but of this one he used to say, How can I confess so foul a
sin?  He wished to give it up, but he could not prevail on
himself to do so.  I was very sorry for him, and it was a great
grief to me to see God offended in such a way.  I promised him
that I would pray to God for his amendment, and get others who
were better than I to do the same.  I wrote to one person, and
the priest undertook to get the letter delivered.  It came to
pass that he made a full confession at the first opportunity; for
our Lord God was pleased, on account of the prayers of those most
holy persons to whom I had recommended him, to have pity on this
soul.  I, too, wretched as I am, did all I could for the
same end.

8. He wrote to me, and said that he was so far improved, that he
had not for some days repeated his sin; but he was so tormented
by the temptation, that it seemed to him as if he were in hell
already, so great were his sufferings.  He asked me to pray to
God for him.  I recommended him to my sisters, through whose
prayers I must have obtained this mercy from our Lord; for they
took the matter greatly to heart; and he was a person whom no one
could find out.  I implored His Majesty to put an end to these
torments and temptations, and to let the evil spirits torment me
instead, provided I did not offend our Lord.  Thus it was that
for one month I was most grievously tormented; and then it was
that these two assaults of Satan, of which I have just spoken,
took place.

9. Our Lord was pleased to deliver him out of this temptation, so
I was informed; for I told him what happened to myself that
month.  His soul gained strength, and he continued free; he could
never give thanks enough to our Lord and to me as if I had been
of any service--unless it be that the belief he had that our Lord
granted me such graces was of some advantage to him.  He said
that, when he saw himself in great straits, he would read my
letters, and then the temptation left him.  He was very much
astonished at my sufferings, and at the manner of his own
deliverance: even I myself am astonished, and I would suffer as
much for many years for the deliverance of that soul.  May our
Lord be praised for ever! for the prayers of those who serve Him
can do great things; and I believe the sisters of this house do
serve Him.  The devils must have been more angry with me only
because I asked them to pray, and because our Lord permitted it
on account of my sins.  At that time, too, I thought the evil
spirits would have suffocated me one night, and when the sisters
threw much holy water about I saw a great troop of them rush away
as if tumbling over a precipice.  These cursed spirits have
tormented me so often, and I am now so little afraid of
them,--because I see they cannot stir without our Lord's
permission,--that I should weary both you, my father, and
myself, if I were to speak of these things in detail.

10. May this I have written be of use to the true servant of God,
who ought to despise these terrors, which Satan sends only to
make him afraid!  Let him understand that each time we despise
those terrors, their force is lessened, and the soul gains power
over them.  There is always some great good obtained; but I will
not speak of it, that I may not be too diffuse.  I will speak,
however, of what happened to me once on the night of All Souls.
I was in an oratory, and, having said one Nocturn, was saying
some very devotional prayers at the end of our Breviary, when
Satan put himself on the book before me, to prevent my finishing
my prayer.  I made the sign of the cross, and he went away.
I then returned to my prayer, and he, too, came back; he did so,
I believe, three times, and I was not able to finish the prayer
without throwing holy water at him.  I saw certain souls at that
moment come forth out of purgatory--they must have been near
their deliverance, and I thought that Satan might in this way
have been trying to hinder their release.  It is very rarely that
I saw Satan assume a bodily form; I know of his presence through
the vision I have spoken of before, [2] the vision wherein no
form is seen.

11. I wish also to relate what follows, for I was greatly alarmed
at it: on Trinity Sunday, in the choir of a certain monastery,
and in a trance, I saw a great fight between evil spirits and the
angels.  I could not make out what the vision meant.  In less
than a fortnight, it was explained clearly enough by the dispute
that took place between persons given to prayer and many who were
not, which did great harm to that house; for it was a dispute
that lasted long and caused much trouble.  On another occasion, I
saw a great multitude of evil spirits round about me, and, at the
same time, a great light, in which I was enveloped, which kept
them from coming near me.  I understood it to mean that God was
watching over me, that they might not approach me so as to make
me offend Him.  I knew the vision was real by what I saw
occasionally in myself.  The fact is, I know now how little power
the evil spirits have, provided I am not out of the grace of God;
I have scarcely any fear of them at all, for their strength is as
nothing, if they do not find the souls they assail give up the
contest, and become cowards; it is in this case that they show
their power.

12. Now and then, during the temptations I am speaking of, it
seemed to me as if all my vanity and weakness in times past had
become alive again within me; so I had reason enough to commit
myself into the hands of God.  Then I was tormented by the
thought that, as these things came back to my memory, I must be
utterly in the power of Satan, until my confessor consoled me;
for I imagined that even the first movement towards an evil
thought ought not to have come near one who had received from our
Lord such great graces as I had.

13. At other times, I was much tormented--and even now I am
tormented--when I saw people make much of me, particularly great
people, and when they spake well of me.  I have suffered, and
still suffer, much in this way.  I think at once of the life of
Christ and of the Saints, and then my life seems the reverse of
theirs, for they received nothing but contempt and ill-treatment.
All this makes me afraid; I dare not lift up my head, and I wish
nobody saw me at all.  It is not thus with me when I am
persecuted; then my soul is so conscious of strength, though the
body suffers, and though I am in other ways afflicted, that I do
not know how this can be; but so it is,--and my soul seems then
to be a queen in its kingdom, having everything under its feet.

14. I had such a thought now and then--and, indeed, for many days
together.  I regarded it as a sign of virtue and of humility; but
I see clearly now it was nothing else but a temptation.
A Dominican friar, of great learning, showed it to me very
plainly. When I considered that the graces which our Lord had
bestowed upon me might come to the knowledge of the public, my
sufferings became so excessive as greatly to disturb my soul.
They went so far, that I made up my mind, while thinking of it,
that I would rather be buried alive than have these things known.
And so, when I began to be profoundly recollected, or to fall
into a trance, which I could not resist even in public, I was so
ashamed of myself, that I would not appear where people might
see me.

15. Once, when I was much distressed at this, our Lord said to
me, What was I afraid of? one of two things must happen--people
would either speak ill of me, or give glory to Him.  He made me
understand by this, that those who believed in the truth of what
was going on in me would glorify Him; and that those who did not
would condemn me without cause: in both ways I should be the
gainer, and I was therefore not to distress myself. [3]  This
made me quite calm, and it comforts me whenever I think of it.

16. This temptation became so excessive, that I wished to leave
the house, and take my dower to another monastery, where
enclosure was more strictly observed than in that wherein I was
at this time.  I had heard great things of that other house,
which was of the same Order as mine; it was also at a great
distance, and it would have been a great consolation to me to
live where I was not known; but my confessor would never let me
go.  These fears deprived me in a great measure of all liberty of
spirit; and I understood afterwards that this was not true
humility, because it disturbed me so much.  And our Lord taught
me this truth; if I was convinced, and certainly persuaded, that
all that was good in me came wholly and only from God, and if it
did not distress me to hear the praises of others,--yea, rather,
if I was pleased and comforted when I saw that God was working in
them,--then neither should I be distressed if He showed forth His
works in me.

17. I fell, too, into another extreme.  I begged of God, and made
it a particular subject of prayer, that it might please His
Majesty, whenever any one saw any good in me, that such a one
might also become acquainted with my sins, in order that he might
see that His graces were bestowed on me without any merit on my
part: and I always greatly desire this.  My confessor told me not
to do it.  But almost to this day, if I saw that any one thought
well of me, I used in a roundabout way, or any how, as I could,
to contrive he should know of my sins: [4] that seemed to relieve
me.  But they have made me very scrupulous on this point.
This, it appears to me, was not an effect of humility, but
oftentimes the result of temptation.  It seemed to me that I was
deceiving everybody--though, in truth, they deceived themselves,
by thinking that there was any good in me. [5]  I did not wish to
deceive them, nor did I ever attempt it, only our Lord permitted
it for some end; and so, even with my confessors, I never
discussed any of these matters if I did not see the necessity of
it, for that would have occasioned very considerable scruples.

18. All these little fears and distresses, and semblance of
humility, I now see clearly were mere imperfections, and the
result of my unmortified life; for a soul left in the hands of
God cares nothing about evil or good report, if it clearly
comprehends, when our Lord is pleased to bestow upon it His
grace, that it has nothing of its own.  Let it trust the Giver;
it will know hereafter why He reveals His gifts, and prepare
itself for persecution, which in these times is sure to come,
when it is our Lord's will it should be known of any one that He
bestows upon him graces such as these; for a thousand eyes are
watching that soul, while a thousand souls of another order are
observed of none.  In truth, there was no little ground for fear,
and that fear should have been mine: I was therefore not humble,
but a coward; for a soul which God permits to be thus seen of men
may well prepare itself to be the world's martyr--because, if it
will not die to the world voluntarily, that very world will
kill it.

19. Certainly, I see nothing in the world that seems to me good
except this, that it tolerates no faults in good people, and
helps them to perfection by dint of complaints against them.
I mean, that it requires greater courage in one not yet perfect
to walk in the way of perfection than to undergo an instant
martyrdom; for perfection is not attained to at once, unless our
Lord grant that grace by a special privilege: yet the world, when
it sees any one beginning to travel on that road, insists on his
becoming perfect at once, and a thousand leagues off detects in
him a fault, which after all may be a virtue.  He who finds fault
is doing the very same thing,--but, in his own case,
viciously,--and he pronounces it to be so wrong in the other.
He who aims at perfection, then, must neither eat nor
sleep,--nor, as they say, even breathe; and the more men respect
such a one, the more do they forget that he is still in the body;
and, though they may consider him perfect, he is living on the
earth, subject to its miseries, however much he may tread them
under his feet. And so, as I have just said, great courage is
necessary here for, though the poor soul have not yet begun to
walk, the world will have it fly; and, though its passions be not
wholly overcome, men will have it that they must be under
restraint, even upon trying occasions, as those of the Saints
are, of whom they read, after they are confirmed in grace.

20. All this is a reason for praising God, and also for great
sorrow of heart, because very many go backwards who, poor souls,
know not how to help themselves; and I too, I believe, would have
gone back also, if our Lord had not so mercifully on His part
done everything for me.  And until He, of His goodness, had done
all, nothing was done by me, as you, my father, may have seen
already, beyond falling and rising again.  I wish I knew how to
explain it, because many souls, I believe, delude themselves in
this matter; they would fly before God gives them wings.

21. I believe I have made this comparison on another
occasion, [6] but it is to the purpose here, for I see certain
souls are very greatly afflicted on that ground.  When these
souls begin, with great fervour, courage, and desire, to advance
in virtue,--some of them, at least outwardly, giving up all for
God,--when they see in others, more advanced than themselves,
greater fruits of virtue given them by our Lord,--for we cannot
acquire these of ourselves,--when they see in all the books
written on prayer and on contemplation an account of what we have
to do in order to attain thereto, but which they cannot
accomplish themselves,--they lose heart.  For instance, they read
that we must not be troubled when men speak ill of us, that we
are to be then more pleased than when they speak well of us; that
we must despise our own good name, be detached from our kindred;
avoid their company, which should be wearisome to us, unless they
be given to prayer; with many other things of the same kind.
The disposition to practise this must be, in my opinion, the gift
of God; for it seems to me a supernatural good, contrary to our
natural inclinations.  Let them not distress themselves; let them
trust in our Lord: what they now desire, His Majesty will enable
them to attain to by prayer, and by doing what they can
themselves; for it is very necessary for our weak nature that we
should have great confidence, that we should not be fainthearted,
nor suppose that, if we do our best, we shall fail to obtain the
victory at last.  And as my experience here is large, I will say,
by way of caution to you, my father, do not think--though it may
seem so--that a virtue is acquired when we have not tested it by
its opposing vice: we must always be suspicious of ourselves, and
never negligent while we live; for much evil clings to us if, as
I said before, [7] grace be not given to us fully to understand
what everything is: and in this life there is nothing without
great risks.

22. I thought a few years ago, not only that I was detached from
my kindred, but that they were a burden to me; and certainly it
was so, for I could not endure their conversation.  An affair of
some importance had to be settled, and I had to remain with a
sister of mine, for whom I had always before had a great
affection.  The conversation we had together, though she is
better than I am, did not please me; for it could not always be
on subjects I preferred, owing to the difference of our
conditions--she being married.  I was therefore as much alone as
I could; yet I felt that her troubles gave me more trouble than
did those of my neighbours, and even some anxiety.  In short, I
found out that I was not so detached as I thought, and that it
was necessary for me to flee from dangerous occasions, in order
that the virtue which our Lord had begun to implant in me might
grow; and so, by His help, I have striven to do from that time
till now.

23. If our Lord bestows any virtue upon us, we must make much of
it, and by no means run the risk of losing it; so it is in those
things which concern our good name, and many other matters.
You, my father, must believe that we are not all of us detached,
though we think we are; it is necessary for us never to be
careless on this point.  If any one detects in himself any
tenderness about his good name, and yet wishes to advance in the
spiritual life, let him believe me and throw this embarrassment
behind his back, for it is a chain which no file can sever; only
the help of God, obtained by prayer and much striving on his
part, can do it.  It seems to me to be a hindrance on the road,
and I am astonished at the harm it does.  I see some persons so
holy in their works, and they are so great as to fill people with
wonder.  O my God, why is their soul still on the earth?  Why has
it not arrived at the summit of perfection?  What does it mean?
What keeps him back who does so much for God?  Oh, there it
is!--self-respect! and the worst of it is, that these persons
will not admit that they have it, merely because Satan now and
then convinces them that they are under an obligation to
observe it.

24. Well, then, let them believe me: for the love of our Lord,
let them give heed to the little ant, who speaks because it is
His pleasure.  If they take not this caterpillar away, though it
does not hurt the whole tree, because some virtues remain, the
worm will eat into every one of them.  Not only is the tree not
beautiful, but it also never thrives, neither does it suffer the
others near it to thrive; for the fruit of good example which it
bears is not sound, and endures but a short time.  I say it again
and again, let our self-respect be ever so slight, it will have
the same result as the missing of a note on the organ when it is
played,--the whole music is out of tune.  It is a thing which
hurts the soul exceedingly in every way, but it is a pestilence
in the way of prayer.

25. Are we striving after union with God? and do we wish to
follow the counsels of Christ,--who was loaded with reproaches
and falsely accused,--and, at the same time, to keep our own
reputation and credit untouched?  We cannot succeed, for these
things are inconsistent one with another.  Our Lord comes to the
soul when we do violence to ourselves, and strive to give up our
rights in many things.  Some will say, I have nothing that I can
give up, nor have I any opportunity of doing so.  I believe that
our Lord will never suffer any one who has made so good a
resolution as this to miss so great a blessing.  His Majesty will
make so many arrangements for him, whereby he may acquire this
virtue,--more frequently, perhaps, than he will like.  Let him
put his hand to the work.  I speak of the little nothings and
trifles which I gave up when I began--or, at least, of some of
them: the straws which I said [8] I threw into the fire; for I am
not able to do more.  All this our Lord accepted: may He be
blessed for evermore!

26. One of my faults was this: I had a very imperfect knowledge
of my Breviary and of my duties in choir, simply because I was
careless and given to vanities; and I knew the other novices
could have taught me.  But I never asked them, that they might
not know how little I knew.  It suggested itself to me at once,
that I ought to set a good example: this is very common.
Now, however, that God has opened my eyes a little, even when I
know a thing, but yet am very slightly in doubt about it, I ask
the children.  I have lost neither honour nor credit by it--on
the contrary, I believe our Lord has been pleased to strengthen
my memory.  My singing of the Office was bad, and I felt it much
if I had not learned the part intrusted to me,--not because I
made mistakes before our Lord, which would have been a virtue,
but because I made them before the many nuns who heard me.  I was
so full of my own reputation, that I was disturbed, and therefore
did not sing what I had to sing even so well as I might have
done.  Afterwards, I ventured, when I did not know it very well,
to say so.  At first, I felt it very much; but afterwards I found
pleasure in doing it.  So, when I began to be indifferent about
its being known that I could not sing well, it gave me no pain at
all, and I sang much better.  This miserable self-esteem took
from me the power of doing that which I regarded as an honour,
for every one regards as honourable that which he likes.

27. By trifles such as these, which are nothing,--and I am
altogether nothing myself, seeing that this gave me pain,--by
little and little, doing such actions, and by such slight
performances,--they become of worth because done for God,--His
Majesty helps us on towards greater things; and so it happened to
me in the matter of humility.  When I saw that all the nuns
except myself were making great progress,--I was always myself
good for nothing,--I used to fold up their mantles when they left
the choir.  I looked on myself as doing service to angels who had
been there praising God.  I did so till they--I know not
how--found it out; and then I was not a little ashamed, because
my virtue was not strong enough to bear that they should know of
it. But the shame arose, not because I was humble, but because I
was afraid they would laugh at me, the matter being so trifling.

28. O Lord, what a shame for me to lay bare so much wickedness,
and to number these grains of sand, which yet I did not raise up
from the ground in Thy service without mixing them with a
thousand meannesses!  The waters of Thy grace were not as yet
flowing beneath them, so as to make them ascend upwards.  O my
Creator, oh, that I had anything worth recounting amid so many
evil things, when I am recounting the great mercies I received at
Thy hands!  So it is, O my Lord.  I know not how my heart could
have borne it, nor how any one who shall read this can help
having me in abhorrence when he sees that mercies so great had
been so ill-requited, and that I have not been ashamed to speak
of these services.  Ah! they are only mine, O my Lord; but I am
ashamed I have nothing else to say of myself; and that it is that
makes me speak of these wretched beginnings, in order that he who
has begun more nobly may have hope that our Lord, who has made
much of mine, will make more of his.  May it please His Majesty
to give me this grace, that I may not remain for ever at the
beginning!  Amen. [9]

Chapter XXXII.


Our Lord Shows St. Teresa the Place Which She Had by Her Sins
Deserved in Hell.  The Torments There.  How the Monastery
of St. Joseph Was Founded.


1. Some considerable time after our Lord had bestowed upon me the
graces I have been describing, and others also of a higher
nature, I was one day in prayer when I found myself in a moment,
without knowing how, plunged apparently into hell.  I understood
that it was our Lord's will I should see the place which the
devils kept in readiness for me, and which I had deserved by my
sins.  It was but a moment, but it seems to me impossible I
should ever forget it even if I were to live many years.

2. The entrance seemed to be by a long narrow pass, like a
furnace, very low, dark, and close.  The ground seemed to be
saturated with water, mere mud, exceedingly foul, sending forth
pestilential odours, and covered with loathsome vermin.  At the
end was a hollow place in the wall, like a closet, and in that I
saw myself confined.  All this was even pleasant to behold in
comparison with what I felt there.  There is no exaggeration in
what I am saying.

3. But as to what I then felt, I do not know where to begin, if I
were to describe it; it is utterly inexplicable.  I felt a fire
in my soul.  I cannot see how it is possible to describe it.
My bodily sufferings were unendurable.  I have undergone most
painful sufferings in this life, and, as the physicians say, the
greatest that can be borne, such as the contraction of my sinews
when I was paralysed, [1] without speaking of others of different
kinds, yea, even those of which I have also spoken, [2] inflicted
on me by Satan; yet all these were as nothing in comparison with
what I felt then, especially when I saw that there would be no
intermission, nor any end to them.

4. These sufferings were nothing in comparison with the anguish
of my soul, a sense of oppression, of stifling, and of pain so
keen, accompanied by so hopeless and cruel an infliction, that I
know not how to speak of it.  If I said that the soul is
continually being torn from the body, it would be nothing, for
that implies the destruction of life by the hands of another but
here it is the soul itself that is tearing itself in pieces.
I cannot describe that inward fire or that despair, surpassing
all torments and all pain.  I did not see who it was that
tormented me, but I felt myself on fire, and torn to pieces, as
it seemed to me; and, I repeat it, this inward fire and despair
are the greatest torments of all.

5. Left in that pestilential place, and utterly without the power
to hope for comfort, I could neither sit nor lie down: there was
no room.  I was placed as it were in a hole in the wall; and
those walls, terrible to look on of themselves, hemmed me in on
every side.  I could not breathe.  There was no light, but all
was thick darkness.  I do not understand how it is; though there
was no light, yet everything that can give pain by being seen
was visible.

6. Our Lord at that time would not let me see more of hell.
Afterwards, I had another most fearful vision, in which I saw the
punishment of certain sins.  They were most horrible to look at;
but, because I felt none of the pain, my terror was not so great.
In the former vision, our Lord made me really feel those
torments, and that anguish of spirit, just as if I had been
suffering them in the body there.  I know not how it was, but I
understood distinctly that it was a great mercy that our Lord
would have me see with mine own eyes the very place from which
His compassion saved me.  I have listened to people speaking of
these things, and I have at other times dwelt on the various
torments of hell, though not often, because my soul made no
progress by the way of fear; and I have read of the diverse
tortures, and how the devils tear the flesh with red-hot pincers.
But all is as nothing before this; it is a wholly different
matter.  In short, the one is a reality, the other a picture; and
all burning here in this life is as nothing in comparison with
the fire that is there.

7. I was so terrified by that vision,--and that terror is on me
even now while I am writing,--that, though it took place nearly
six years ago, [3] the natural warmth of my body is chilled by
fear even now when I think of it.  And so, amid all the pain and
suffering which I may have had to bear, I remember no time in
which I do not think that all we have to suffer in this world is
as nothing.  It seems to me that we complain without reason.
I repeat it, this vision was one of the grandest mercies of our
Lord.  It has been to me of the greatest service, because it has
destroyed my fear of trouble and of the contradiction of the
world, and because it has made me strong enough to bear up
against them, and to give thanks to our Lord, who has been my
Deliverer, as it now seems to me, from such fearful and
everlasting pains.

8. Ever since that time, as I was saying, everything seems
endurable in comparison with one instant of suffering such as
those I had then to bear in hell.  I am filled with fear when I
see that, after frequently reading books which describe in some
manner the pains of hell, I was not afraid of them, nor made any
account of them.  Where was I?  How could I possibly take any
pleasure in those things which led me directly to so dreadful a
place?  Blessed for ever be Thou, O my God! and, oh, how manifest
is it that Thou didst love me much more than I did love Thee!
How often, O Lord, didst Thou save me from that fearful prison!
and how I used to get back to it contrary to Thy will.

9. It was that vision that filled me with the very great distress
which I feel at the sight of so many lost souls,--especially of
the Lutherans,--for they were once members of the Church by
baptism,--and also gave me the most vehement desires for the
salvation of souls; for certainly I believe that, to save even
one from those overwhelming torments, I would most willingly
endure many deaths.  If here on earth we see one whom we
specially love in great trouble or pain, our very nature seems to
bid us compassionate him; and if those pains be great, we are
troubled ourselves.  What, then, must it be to see a soul in
danger of pain, the most grievous of all pains, for ever?
Who can endure it?  It is a thought no heart can bear without
great anguish.  Here we know that pain ends with life at last,
and that there are limits to it; yet the sight of it moves our
compassion so greatly.  That other pain has no ending; and I know
not how we can be calm, when we see Satan carry so many souls
daily away.

10. This also makes me wish that, in a matter which concerns us
so much, we did not rest satisfied with doing less than we can do
on our part,--that we left nothing undone.  May our Lord
vouchsafe to give us His grace for that end!  When I consider
that, notwithstanding my very great wickedness, I took some pains
to please God, and abstained from certain things which I know the
world makes light of,--that, in short, I suffered grievous
infirmities, and with great patience, which our Lord gave me;
that I was not inclined to murmur or to speak ill of anybody;
that I could not--I believe so--wish harm to any one; that I was
not, to the best of my recollection, either avaricious or
envious, so as to be grievously offensive in the sight of God;
and that I was free from many other faults,--for, though so
wicked, I had lived constantly in the fear of God,--I had to look
at the very place which the devils kept ready for me.  It is true
that, considering my faults, I had deserved a still heavier
chastisement; but for all that, I repeat it, the torment was
fearful, and we run a great risk whenever we please ourselves.
No soul should take either rest or pleasure that is liable to
fall every moment into mortal sin.  Let us, then, for the love of
God, avoid all occasions of sin, and our Lord will help us, as He
has helped me.  May it please His Majesty never to let me out of
His hands, lest I should turn back and fall, now that I have seen
the place where I must dwell if I do.  I entreat our Lord, for
His Majesty's sake, never to permit it.  Amen.

11. When I had seen this vision, and had learned other great and
hidden things which our Lord, of His goodness, was pleased to
show me,--namely, the joy of the blessed and the torment of the
wicked,--I longed for the way and the means of doing penance for
the great evil I had done, and of meriting in some degree, so
that I might gain so great a good; and therefore I wished to
avoid all society, and to withdraw myself utterly from the world.
I was in spirit restless, yet my restlessness was not harassing,
but rather pleasant.  I saw clearly that it was the work of God,
and that His Majesty had furnished my soul with fervour, so that
I might be able to digest other and stronger food than I had been
accustomed to eat.  I tried to think what I could do for God, and
thought that the first thing was to follow my vocation to a
religious life, which His Majesty had given me, by keeping my
rule in the greatest perfection possible.

12. Though in that house in which I then lived there were many
servants of God, and God was greatly served therein, yet, because
it was very poor, the nuns left it very often and went to other
places, where, however, we could serve God in all honour and
observances of religion.  The rule also was kept, not in its
original exactness, but according to the custom of the whole
Order, authorised by the Bull of Mitigation.  There were other
inconveniences also: we had too many comforts, as it seemed to
me; for the house was large and pleasant.  But this inconvenience
of going out, though it was I that took most advantage of it, was
a very grievous one for me; for many persons, to whom my
superiors could not say no, were glad to have me with them.
My superiors, thus importuned, commanded me to visit these
persons; and thus it was so arranged that I could not be long
together in the monastery.  Satan, too, must have had a share in
this, in order that I might not be in the house, where I was of
great service to those of my sisters to whom I continually
communicated the instructions which I received from
my confessors.

13. It occurred once to a person with whom I was speaking to say
to me and the others that it was possible to find means for the
foundation of a monastery, if we were prepared to become nuns
like those of the Barefooted Orders. [4]  I, having this desire,
began to discuss the matter with that widowed lady who was my
companion,--I have spoken of her before, [5]--and she had the
same wish that I had.  She began to consider how to provide a
revenue for the home.  I see now that this was not the way,--only
the wish we had to do so made us think it was; but I, on the
other hand, seeing that I took the greatest delight in the house
in which I was then living, because it was very pleasant to me,
and, in my own cell, most convenient for my purpose, still held
back.  Nevertheless, we agreed to commit the matter with all
earnestness to God.

14. One day, after Communion, our Lord commanded me to labour
with all my might for this end.  He made me great promises,--that
the monastery would be certainly built; that He would take great
delight therein; that it should be called St. Joseph's; that
St. Joseph would keep guard at one door, and our Lady at the
other; that Christ would be in the midst of us; that the
monastery would be a star shining in great splendour; that,
though the religious Orders were then relaxed, I was not to
suppose that He was scantily served in them,--for what would
become of the world, if there were no religious in it?--I was to
tell my confessor what He commanded me, and that He asked him not
to oppose nor thwart me in the matter.

15. So efficacious was the vision, and such was the nature of the
words our Lord spoke to me, that I could not possibly doubt that
they came from Him.  I suffered most keenly, because I saw in
part the great anxieties and troubles that the work would cost
me, and I was also very happy in the house I was in then; and
though I used to speak of this matter in past times, yet it was
not with resolution nor with any confidence that the thing could
ever be done.  I saw that I was now in a great strait; and when I
saw that I was entering on a work of great anxiety, I hesitated;
but our Lord spoke of it so often to me, and set before me so
many reasons and motives, which I saw could not be gainsaid,--I
saw, too, that such was His will; so I did not dare do otherwise
than put the whole matter before my confessor, and give him an
account in writing of all that took place.

16. My confessor did not venture definitely to bid me abandon my
purpose; but he saw that naturally there was no way of carrying
it out; because my friend, who was to do it, had very little or
no means available for that end.  He told me to lay the matter
before my superior, [6] and do what he might bid me do.  I never
spoke of my visions to my superior, but that lady who desired to
found the monastery communicated with him.  The Provincial was
very much pleased, for he loves the whole Order, gave her every
help that was necessary, and promised to acknowledge the house.
Then there was a discussion about the revenues of the monastery,
and for many reasons we never would allow more than thirteen
sisters together.  Before we began our arrangements, we wrote to
the holy friar, Peter of Alcantara, telling him all that was
taking place; and he advised us not to abandon our work, and gave
us his sanction on all points.

17. As soon as the affair began to be known here, there fell upon
us a violent persecution, which cannot be very easily
described--sharp sayings and keen jests.  People said it was
folly in me, who was so well off in my monastery; as to my
friend, the persecution was so continuous, that it wearied her.
I did not know what to do, and I thought that people were partly
in the right.  When I was thus heavily afflicted, I commended
myself to God, and His Majesty began to console and encourage me.
He told me that I could then see what the Saints had to go
through who founded the religious Orders: that I had much heavier
persecutions to endure than I could imagine, but I was not to
mind them.  He told me also what I was to say to my friend; and
what surprised me most was, that we were consoled at once as to
the past, and resolved to withstand everybody courageously.
And so it came to pass; for among people of prayer, and indeed in
the whole neighbourhood, there was hardly one who was not against
us, and who did not think our work the greatest folly.

18. There was so much talking and confusion in the very monastery
wherein I was, that the Provincial began to think it hard for him
to set himself against everybody; so he changed his mind, and
would not acknowledge the new house.  He said that the revenue
was not certain, and too little, while the opposition was great.
On the whole, it seemed that he was right; he gave it up at last,
and would have nothing to do with it.  It was a very great pain
to us,--for we seemed now to have received the first blow,--and
in particular to me, to find the Provincial against us; for when
he approved of the plan, I considered myself blameless before
all.  They would not give absolution to my friend, if she did not
abandon the project; for they said she was bound to remove
the scandal.

19. She went to a very learned man, and a very great servant of
God, of the Order of St. Dominic, [7] to whom she gave an account
of all this matter.  This was even before the Provincial had
withdrawn his consent; for in this place we had no one who would
give us advice; and so they said that it all proceeded solely
from our obstinacy.  That lady gave an account of everything, and
told the holy man how much she received from the property of her
husband.  Having, a great desire that he would help us,--for he
was the most learned man here, and there are few in his Order
more learned than he,--I told him myself all we intended to do,
and some of my motives.  I never said a word of any revelation
whatever, speaking only of the natural reasons which influenced
me; for I would not have him give an opinion otherwise than on
those grounds.  He asked us to give him eight days before he
answered, and also if we had made up our minds to abide by what
he might say.  I said we had; but though I said so, and though I
thought so, I never lost a certain confidence that the monastery
would be founded.  My friend had more faith than I; nothing they
could say could make her give it up.  As for myself, though, as I
said, it seemed to me impossible that the work should be finally
abandoned, yet my belief in the truth of the revelation went no
further than in so far as it was not against what is contained in
the sacred writings, nor against the laws of the Church, which we
are bound to keep.  Though the revelation seemed to me to have
come really from God, yet, if that learned man had told me that
we could not go on without offending God and going against our
conscience, I believe I should have given it up, and looked out
for some other way; but our Lord showed me no other way
than this.

20. The servant of God told me afterwards that he had made up his
mind to insist on the abandonment of our project, for he had
already heard the popular cry: moreover, he, as everybody did,
thought it folly; and a certain nobleman also, as soon as he knew
that we had gone to him, had sent him word to consider well what
he was doing, and to give us no help; that when he began to
consider the answer he should make us, and to ponder on the
matter, the object we had in view, our manner of life, and the
Order, he became convinced that it was greatly for the service of
God, and that we must not give it up.  Accordingly, his answer
was that we should make haste to settle the matter.  He told us
how and in what way it was to be done; and if our means were
scanty, we must trust somewhat in God.  If anyone made any
objections, they were to go to him--he would answer them; and in
this way he always helped us, as I shall show by and by. [8]

21. This answer was a great comfort to us; so also was the
conduct of certain holy persons who were usually against us: they
were now pacified, and some of them even helped us.  One of them
was the saintly nobleman [9] of whom I spoke before; [10] he
looked on it--so, indeed, it was--as a means of great perfection,
because the whole foundation was laid in prayer.  He saw also
very many difficulties before us, and no way out of them,--yet he
gave up his own opinion, and admitted that the work might be of
God.  Our Lord Himself must have touched his heart, as He also
did that of the doctor, the priest and servant of God, to whom,
as I said before, [11] I first spoke, who is an example to the
whole city,--being one whom God maintains there for the relief
and progress of many souls: he, too, came now to give us
his assistance.

22. When matters had come to this state, and always with the help
of many prayers, we purchased a house in a convenient spot; and
though it was small, I cared not at all for that, for our Lord
had told me to go into it as well as I could,--that I should see
afterwards what He would do; and how well I have seen it!  I saw,
too, how scanty were our means; and yet I believed our Lord
would order these things by other ways, and be gracious unto us.

Chapter XXXIII.


The Foundation of the Monastery Hindered.  Our Lord Consoles
the Saint.


1. When the matter was in this state--so near its conclusion,
that on the very next day the papers were to be signed--then it
was that the Father Provincial changed his mind.  I believe that
the change was divinely ordered--so it appeared afterwards; for
while so many prayers were made, our Lord was perfecting His work
and arranging its execution in another way.  When the Provincial
refused us, my confessor bade me forthwith to think no more of
it, notwithstanding the great trouble and distress which our Lord
knows it cost me to bring it to this state.  When the work was
given up and abandoned, people were the more convinced that it
was altogether the foolishness of women; and the complaints
against me were multiplied, although I had until then this
commandment of my Provincial to justify me.

2. I was now very much disliked throughout the whole monastery,
because I wished to found another with stricter enclosure.
It was said I insulted my sisters; that I could serve God among
them as well as elsewhere, for there were many among them much
better than I; that I did not love the house, and that it would
have been better if I had procured greater resources for it than
for another.  Some said I ought to be put in prison; others--but
they were not many--defended me in some degree.  I saw well
enough that they were for the most part right, and now and then I
made excuses for myself; though, as I could not tell them the
chief reason, which was the commandment of our Lord, I knew not
what to do, and so was silent.

3. In other respects God was most merciful unto me, for all this
caused me no uneasiness; and I gave up our design with much
readiness and joy, as if it cost me nothing.  No one could
believe it, not even those men of prayer with whom I conversed;
for they thought I was exceedingly pained and sorry: even my
confessor himself could hardly believe it.  I had done, as it
seemed to me, all that was in my power.  I thought myself obliged
to do no more than I had done to fulfil our Lord's commandment,
and so I remained in the house where I was, exceedingly happy and
joyful; though, at the same time, I was never able to give up my
conviction that the work would be done.  I had now no means of
doing it, nor did I know how or when it would be done; but I
firmly believed in its accomplishment.

4. I was much distressed at one time by a letter which my
confessor wrote to me, as if I had done anything in the matter
contrary to his will.  Our Lord also must have meant that
suffering should not fail me there where I should feel it most;
and so, amid the multitude of my persecutions, when, as it seemed
to me, consolations should have come from my confessor, he told
me that I ought to recognise in the result that all was a dream;
that I ought to lead a new life by ceasing to have anything to do
for the future with it, or even to speak of it any more, seeing
the scandal it had occasioned.  He made some further remarks, all
of them very painful.  This was a greater affliction to me than
all the others together.  I considered whether I had done
anything myself, and whether I was to blame for anything that was
an offence unto God; whether all my visions were illusions, all
my prayers a delusion, and I, therefore, deeply deluded and lost.
This pressed so heavily upon me, that I was altogether disturbed
and most grievously distressed.  But our Lord, who never failed
me in all the trials I speak of, so frequently consoled and
strengthened me, that I need not speak of it here.  He told me
then not to distress myself; that I had pleased God greatly, and
had not sinned against Him throughout the whole affair; that I
was to do what my confessors required of me, and be silent on the
subject till the time came to resume it.  I was so comforted and
so happy, that the persecution which had befallen me seemed to be
as nothing at all.

5. Our Lord now showed me what an exceedingly great blessing it
is to be tried and persecuted for His sake; for the growth of the
love of God in my soul, which I now discerned, as well as of many
other virtues, was such as to fill me with wonder.  It made me
unable to abstain from desiring trials, and yet those about me
thought I was exceedingly disheartened; and I must have been so,
if our Lord in that extremity had not succoured me with His great
compassion.  Now was the beginning of those more violent
impetuosities of the love of God of which I have spoken
before, [1] as well as of those profounder trances.  I kept
silence, however, and never spoke of those graces to any one.
The saintly Dominican [2] was as confident as I was that the work
would be done; and as I would not speak of it, in order that
nothing might take place contrary to the obedience I owed my
confessor, he communicated with my companion, and they wrote
letters to Rome and made their preparations.

6. Satan also contrived now that persons should hear one from
another that I had had a revelation in the matter; and people
came to me in great terror, saying that the times were dangerous,
that something might be laid to my charge, and that I might be
taken before the Inquisitors.  I heard this with pleasure, and it
made me laugh, because I never was afraid of them; for I knew
well enough that in matters of faith I would not break the least
ceremony of the Church, that I would expose myself to die a
thousand times rather than that any one should see me go against
it or against any truth of Holy Writ.  So I told them I was not
afraid of that, for my soul must be in a very bad state if there
was anything the matter with it of such a nature as to make me
fear the Inquisition; I would go myself and give myself up, if I
thought there was anything amiss; and if I should be denounced,
our Lord would deliver me, and I should gain much.

7. I had recourse to my Dominican father; for I could rely upon
him, because he was a learned man.  I told him all about my
visions, my way of prayer, the great graces our Lord had given
me, as clearly as I could, and I begged him to consider the
matter well, and tell me if there was anything therein at
variance with the Holy Writings, and give me his opinion on the
whole matter.  He reassured me much, and, I think, profited
himself; for though he was exceedingly good, yet, from this time
forth, he gave himself more and more to prayer, and retired to a
monastery of his Order which was very lonely, that he might apply
himself more effectually to prayer, where he remained more than
two years.  He was dragged out of his solitude by obedience, to
his great sorrow: his superiors required his services; for he was
a man of great ability.  I, too, on my part, felt his retirement
very much, because it was a great loss to me, though I did not
disturb him.  But I knew it was a gain to him; for when I was so
much distressed at his departure, our Lord bade me be comforted,
not to take it to heart, for he was gone under good guidance.

8. So, when he came back, his soul had made such great progress,
and he was so advanced in the ways of the spirit, that he told me
on his return he would not have missed that journey for anything
in the world.  And I, too, could say the same thing; for where he
reassured and consoled me formerly by his mere learning, he did
so now through that spiritual experience he had gained of
supernatural things.  And God, too, brought him here in time; for
He saw that his help would be required in the foundation of the
monastery, which His Majesty willed should be laid.

9. I remained quiet after this for five or six months, neither
thinking nor speaking of the matter; nor did our Lord once speak
to me about it.  I know not why, but I could never rid myself of
the thought that the monastery would be founded.  At the end of
that time, the then Rector [3] of the Society of Jesus having
gone away, His Majesty brought into his place another, [4] of
great spirituality, high courage, strong understanding, and
profound learning, at the very time when I was in great straits.
As he who then heard my confession had a superior over him--the
fathers of the Society are extremely strict about the virtue of
obedience and never stir but in conformity with the will of their
superiors,--so he would not dare, though he perfectly understood
my spirit, and desired the accomplishment of my purpose, to come
to any resolution; and he had many reasons to justify his
conduct.  I was at the same time subject to such great
impetuosities of spirit, that I felt my chains extremely heavy;
nevertheless, I never swerved from the commandment he gave me.

10. One day, when in great distress, because I thought my
confessor did not trust me, our Lord said to me, Be not troubled;
this suffering will soon be over.  I was very much delighted,
thinking I should die shortly; and I was very happy whenever I
recalled those words to remembrance.  Afterwards I saw clearly
that they referred to the coming of the rector of whom I am
speaking, for never again had I any reason to be distressed.
The rector that came never interfered with the father-minister
who was my confessor.  On the contrary, he told him to console
me,--that there was nothing to be afraid of,--and not to direct
me along a road so narrow, but to leave the operations of the
Spirit of God alone; for now and then it seemed as if these great
impetuosities of the spirit took away the very breath of
the soul.

11. The rector came to see me, and my confessor bade me speak to
him in all freedom and openness.  I used to feel the very
greatest repugnance to speak of this matter; but so it was, when
I went into the confessional, I felt in my soul something, I know
not what.  I do not remember to have felt so either before or
after towards any one.  I cannot tell what it was, nor do I know
of anything with which I could compare it.  It was a spiritual
joy, and a conviction in my soul that his soul must understand
mine, that it was in unison with it, and yet, as I have said, I
knew not how.  If I had ever spoken to him, or had heard great
things of him, it would have been nothing out of the way that I
should rejoice in the conviction that he would understand me; but
he had never spoken to me before, nor I to him, and, indeed, he
was a person of whom I had no previous knowledge whatever.

12. Afterwards, I saw clearly that my spirit was not deceived;
for my relations with him were in every way of the utmost service
to me and my soul, because his method of direction is proper for
those persons whom our Lord seems to have led far on the way,
seeing that He makes them run, and not to crawl step by step.
His plan is to render them thoroughly detached and mortified, and
our Lord has endowed him with the highest gifts herein as well as
in many other things beside.  As soon as I began to have to do
with him, I knew his method at once, and saw that he had a pure
and holy soul, with a special grace of our Lord for the
discernment of spirits.  He gave me great consolation.
Shortly after I had begun to speak to him, our Lord began to
constrain me to return to the affair of the monastery, and to lay
before my confessor and the father-rector many reasons and
considerations why they should not stand in my way.  Some of
these reasons made them afraid, for the father-rector never had a
doubt of its being the work of the Spirit of God, because he
regarded the fruits of it with great care and attention.  At
last, after much consideration, they did not dare to
hinder me. [5]

13. My confessor gave me leave to prosecute the work with all my
might.  I saw well enough the trouble I exposed myself to, for I
was utterly alone, and able to do so very little.  We agreed that
it should be carried on with the utmost secrecy; and so I
contrived that one of my sisters, [6] who lived out of the town,
should buy a house, and prepare it as if for herself, with money
which our Lord provided for us. [7]  I made it a great point to
do nothing against obedience; but I knew that if I spoke of it to
my superiors all was lost, as on the former occasion, and worse
even might happen.  In holding the money, in finding the house,
in treating for it, in putting it in order, I had so much to
suffer; and, for the most part, I had to suffer alone, though my
friend did what she could: she could do but little, and that was
almost nothing.  Beyond giving her name and her countenance, the
whole of the trouble was mine; and that fell upon me in so many
ways, that I am astonished now how I could have borne it. [8]
Sometimes, in my affliction, I used to say: O my Lord, how is it
that Thou commandest me to do that which seems impossible?--for,
though I am a woman, yet, if I were free, it might be done; but
when I am tied in so many ways, without money, or the means of
procuring it, either for the purpose of the Brief or for any
other,--what, O Lord, can I do?

14. Once when I was in one of my difficulties, not knowing what
to do, unable to pay the workmen, St. Joseph, my true father and
lord, appeared to me, and gave me to understand that money would
not be wanting, and I must hire the workmen.  So I did, though I
was penniless; and our Lord, in a way that filled those who heard
of it with wonder, provided for me.  The house offered me was too
small,--so much so, that it seemed as if it could never be made
into a monastery,--and I wished to buy another, but had not the
means, and there was neither way nor means to do so. I knew not
what to do.  There was another little house close to the one we
had, which might have formed a small church.  One day, after
Communion, our Lord said to me, I have already bidden thee to go
in anyhow.  And then, as if exclaiming, said: Oh, covetousness of
the human race, thinking that even the whole earth is too little
for it! how often have I slept in the open air, because I had no
place to shelter Me! [9]  I was alarmed, and saw that He had good
reasons to complain.  I went to the little house, arranged the
divisions of it, and found that it would make a sufficient,
though small, monastery.  I did not care now to add to the site
by purchase, and so I did nothing but contrive to have it
prepared in such a way that it could be lived in.  Everything was
coarse, and nothing more was done to it than to render it not
hurtful to health--and that must be done everywhere.

15. As I was going to Communion on her feast, St. Clare appeared
to me in great beauty, and bade me take courage, and go on with
what I had begun; she would help me.  I began to have a great
devotion to St. Clare; and she has so truly kept her word, that a
monastery of nuns of her Order in our neighbourhood helped us to
live; and, what is of more importance, by little and little she
so perfectly fulfilled my desire, that the poverty which the
blessed Saint observes in her own house is observed in this, and
we are living on alms.  It cost me no small labour to have this
matter settled by the plenary sanction and authority of the Holy
Father, [10] so that it shall never be otherwise, and we possess
no revenues.  Our Lord is doing more for us--perhaps we owe it to
the prayers of this blessed Saint; for, without our asking
anybody, His Majesty supplies most abundantly all our wants.
May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.

16. On one of these days--it was the Feast of the Assumption of
our Lady--I was in the church of the monastery of the Order of
the glorious St. Dominic, thinking of the events of my wretched
life, and of the many sins which in times past I had confessed in
that house.  I fell into so profound a trance, that I was as it
were beside myself.  I sat down, and it seemed as if I could
neither see the Elevation nor hear Mass.  This afterwards became
a scruple to me.  I thought then, when I was in that state, that
I saw myself clothed with a garment of excessive whiteness and
splendour.  At first I did not see who was putting it on me.
Afterwards I saw our Lady on my right hand, and my father
St. Joseph on my left, clothing me with that garment.  I was
given to understand that I was then cleansed from my sins.
When I had been thus clad--I was filled with the utmost delight
and joy--our Lady seemed at once to take me by both hands.
She said that I pleased her very much by being devout to the
glorious St. Joseph; that I might rely on it my desires about the
monastery were accomplished, and that our Lord and they too would
be greatly honoured in it; that I was to be afraid of no failure
whatever, though the obedience under which it would be placed
might not be according to my mind, because they would watch over
us, and because her Son had promised to be with us [11]--and, as
a proof of this, she would give me that jewel.  She then seemed
to throw around my neck a most splendid necklace of gold, from
which hung a cross of great value.  The stones and gold were so
different from any in this world, that there is nothing wherewith
to compare them.  The beauty of them is such as can be conceived
by no imagination,--and no understanding can find out the
materials of the robe, nor picture to itself the splendours which
our Lord revealed, in comparison with which all the splendours of
earth, so to say, are a daubing of soot.  This beauty, which I
saw in our Lady, was exceedingly grand, though I did not trace it
in any particular feature, but rather in the whole form of her
face. She was clothed in white and her garments shone with
excessive lustre that was not dazzling, but soft.  I did not see
St. Joseph so distinctly, though I saw clearly that he was there,
as in the visions of which I spoke before, [12] in which nothing
is seen.  Our Lady seemed to be very young.

17. When they had been with me for a while,--I, too, in the
greatest delight and joy, greater than I had ever had before, as
I think, and with which I wished never to part,--I saw them, so
it seemed, ascend up to heaven, attended by a great multitude of
angels.  I was left in great loneliness, though so comforted and
raised up, so recollected in prayer and softened, that I was for
some time unable to move or speak--being, as it were, beside
myself.  I was now possessed by a strong desire to be consumed
for the love of God, and by other affections of the same kind.
Everything took place in such a way that I could never have a
doubt--though I often tried--that the vision came from God. [13]
It left me in the greatest consolation and peace.

18. As to that which the Queen of the Angels spoke about
obedience, it is this: it was painful to me not to subject the
monastery to the Order, and our Lord had told me that it was
inexpedient to do so.  He told me the reasons why it was in no
wise convenient that I should do it but I must send to Rome in a
certain way, which He also explained; He would take care that I
found help there: and so I did.  I sent to Rome, as our Lord
directed me,--for we should never have succeeded otherwise,--and
most favourable was the result.

19. And as to subsequent events, it was very convenient to be
under the Bishop, [14] but at that time I did not know him, nor
did I know what kind of a superior he might be.  It pleased our
Lord that he should be as good and favourable to this house as it
was necessary he should be on account of the great opposition it
met with at the beginning, as I shall show hereafter, [15] and
also for the sake of bringing it to the condition it is now in.
Blessed be He who has done it all!  Amen.

austere and harsh to his subjects, notwithstanding his great
learning: "homini egregie docto ac rebus gestis claro, sed in

Alvarez to make a meditation on Psalm xci. 6: "Quam magnificata
sunt opera Tua."  The Saint obeyed, and the meditation was made.
From that moment, as F. Alvarez afterwards told Father de Ribera
(Life of St. Teresa, i. ch. vii.), there was no further
hesitation on the part of the Saint's confessor.

in Avila, Dec. 31, 1561 (De la Fuente).

8. One day, she went with her sister--she was staying in her
house--to hear a sermon in the church of St. Thomas.  The zealous
preacher denounced visions and revelations; and his observations
were so much to the point, that there was no need of his saying
that they were directed against St. Teresa, who was present.
Her sister was greatly hurt, and persuaded the Saint to return to

Chapter XXXIV.


The Saint Leaves Her Monastery of the Incarnation for a Time, at
the Command of Her Superior.  Consoles an Afflicted Widow.


1. Now, though I was very careful that no one should know what we
were doing, all this work could not be carried on so secretly as
not to come to the knowledge of divers persons; some believed, in
it, others did not, I was in great fear lest the Provincial
should be spoken to about it when he came, and find himself
compelled to order me to give it up; and if he did so, it would
have been abandoned at once.  Our Lord provided against it in
this way.  In a large city, more than twenty leagues distant, was
a lady in great distress on account of her husband's death. [1]
She was in such extreme affliction, that fears were entertained
about her life.  She had heard of me, a poor sinner,--for our
Lord had provided that,--and men spoke well to her of me, for the
sake of other good works which resulted from it.  This lady knew
the Provincial well; and as she was a person of some
consideration, and knew that I lived in a monastery the nuns of
which were permitted to go out, our Lord made her desire much to
see me.  She thought that my presence would be a consolation to
her, and that she could not be comforted otherwise.
She therefore strove by all the means in her power to get me into
her house, sending messages to the Provincial, who was at a
distance far away.

2. The Provincial sent me an order, charging me in virtue of my
obedience to go immediately, with one companion.  I knew of it on
Christmas night.  It caused me some trouble and much suffering to
see that they sent for me because they thought there was some
good in me; I, knowing myself to be so wicked, could not bear it.
I commended myself earnestly to God, and during Matins, or the
greater part of them, was lost in a profound trance.  Our Lord
told me I must go without fail, and give no heed to the opinions
of people, for they were few who would not be rash in their
counsel; and though I should have troubles, yet God would be
served greatly: as to the monastery, it was expedient I should be
absent till the Brief came, because Satan had contrived a great
plot against the coming of the Provincial; that I was to have no
fear,--He would help me.  I repeated this to the rector, and he
told me that I must go by all means, though others were saying I
ought not to go, that it was a trick of Satan to bring some evil
upon me there, and that I ought to send word to the Provincial.

3. I obeyed the rector, and went without fear, because of what I
had understood in prayer, though in the greatest confusion when I
thought of the reasons why they sent for me, and how very much
they were deceived.  It made me more and more importunate with
our Lord that He would not abandon me.  It was a great comfort
that there was a house of the Society of Jesus there whither I
was going, and so I thought I should be in some degree safe under
the direction of those fathers, as I had been here.

4. It was the good pleasure of our Lord that the lady who sent
for me should be so much consoled that a visible improvement was
the immediate result she was comforted every day more and more.
This was very remarkable, because, as I said before, her
suffering had reduced her to great straits.  Our Lord must have
done this in answer to the many prayers which the good people of
my acquaintance made for me, that I might prosper in my work.
She had a profound fear of God, and was so good, that her great
devotion supplied my deficiencies.  She conceived a great
affection for me--I, too, for her, because of her goodness; but
all was as it were a cross for me; for the comforts of her house
were a great torment, and her making so much of me made me
afraid.  I kept my soul continually recollected--I did not dare
to be careless: nor was our Lord careless of me; for while I was
there, He bestowed the greatest graces upon me, and those graces
made me so free, and filled me with such contempt for all I
saw,--and the more I saw, the greater my contempt,--that I never
failed to treat those ladies, whom to serve would have been a
great honour for me, with as much freedom as if I had been
their equal.

5. I derived very great advantages from this, and I said so.
I saw that she was a woman, and as much liable to passion and
weakness as I was; that rank is of little worth, and the higher
it is, the greater the anxiety and trouble it brings.
People must be careful of the dignity of their state, which will
not suffer them to live at ease; they must eat at fixed hours and
by rule, for everything must be according to their state, and not
according to their constitutions; and they have frequently to
take food fitted more for their state than for their liking.

6. So it was that I came to hate the very wish to be a great
lady.  God deliver me from this wicked, artificial life!--though
I believe that this lady, notwithstanding that she was one of the
chief personages of the realm, was a woman of great simplicity,
and that few were more humble than she was.  I was very sorry for
her, for I saw how often she had to submit to much that was
disagreeable to her, because of the requirements of her rank.
Then, as to servants, though this lady had very good servants,
how slight is that little trust that may be put in them!
One must not be conversed with more than another; otherwise, he
who is so favoured is envied by the rest.  This of itself is a
slavery, and one of the lies of the world is that it calls such
persons masters, who, in my eyes, are nothing else but slaves in
a thousand ways.

7. It was our Lord's pleasure that the household of that lady
improved in the service of His Majesty during my stay there,
though I was not exempted from some trials and some jealousies on
the part of some of its members, because of the great affection
their mistress had for me.  They perhaps must have thought I had
some personal interest to serve.  Our Lord must have permitted
such matters, and others of the same kind, to give me trouble, in
order that I might not be absorbed in the comforts which
otherwise I had there; and He was pleased to deliver me out of it
all with great profit to my soul.

8. When I was there, a religious person of great consideration,
and with whom I had conversed occasionally some years ago, [2]
happened to arrive.  When I was at Mass, in a monastery of his
Order, near the house in which I was staying, I felt a longing to
know the state of his soul,--for I wished him to be a great
servant of God,--and I rose up in order to go and speak to him.
But as I was then recollected in prayer, it seemed to me a waste
of time--for what had I to do in that matter?--and so I returned
to my place.  Three times, I think I did this, and at last my
good angel prevailed over the evil one, and I went and asked for
him; and he came to speak to me in one of the confessionals.
We began by asking one another of our past lives, for we had not
seen one another for many years.  I told him that my life had
been one in which my soul had had many trials.  He insisted much
on my telling him what those trials were.  I said that they were
not to be told, and that I was not to tell them.  He replied that
the Dominican father, [3] of whom I have spoken, knew them, and
that, as they were great friends, he could learn them from him,
and so I had better tell them without hesitation.

9. The fact is, that it was not in his power not to insist, nor
in mine, I believe, to refuse to speak; for notwithstanding all
the trouble and shame I used to feel formerly, I spoke of my
state, to him, and to the rector whom I have referred to
before, [4] without any difficulty whatever; on the contrary, it
was a great consolation to me; and so I told him all in
confession.  He seemed to me then more prudent than ever; though
I had always looked upon him as a man of great understanding.
I considered what high gifts and endowments for great services he
had, if he gave himself wholly unto God.  I had this feeling now
for many years, so that I never saw any one who pleased me much
without wishing at once he were given wholly unto God; and
sometimes I feel this so keenly, that I can hardly contain
myself.  Though I long to see everybody serve God, yet my desire
about those who please me is very vehement, and so I importune
our Lord on their behalf.

10. So it happened with respect to this religious.  He asked me
to pray much for him to God.  There was no necessity for his
doing so, because I could not do anything else, and so I went
back to my place where I was in the habit of praying alone, and
began to pray to our Lord, being extremely recollected, in that
my simple, silly way, when I speak without knowing very often
what I am saying.  It is love that speaks, and my soul is so
beside itself, that I do not regard the distance between it and
God.  That love which I know His Majesty has for it makes it
forget itself, and think itself to be one with Him; and so, as
being one with Him, and not divided from Him, the soul speaks
foolishly.  When I had prayed with many tears that the soul of
this religious might serve Him truly,--for, though I considered
it good, it was not enough for me; I would have it much
better,--I remember I said, "O Lord, Thou must not refuse me this
grace; behold him,--he is a fit person to be our friend."

11. Oh, the great goodness and compassion of God!  How He regards
not the words, but the desire and the will with which they are
spoken!  How He suffered such a one as I am to speak so boldly
before His Majesty!  May He be blessed for evermore!

12. I remember that during those hours of prayer on that very
night I was extremely distressed by the thought whether I was in
the grace of God, and that I could never know whether I was so or
not,--not that I wished to know it; I wished, however, to die, in
order that I might not live a life in which I was not sure that I
was not dead in sin, for there could be no death more dreadful
for me than to think that I had sinned against God.  I was in
great straits at this thought.  I implored Him not to suffer me
to fall into sin, with great sweetness, dissolved in tears.
Then I heard that I might console myself, and trust [5] that I
was in a state of grace, because a love of God like mine,
together with the graces and feelings with which His Majesty
filled my soul, was of such a nature as to be inconsistent with a
state of mortal sin.

13. I was now confident that our Lord would grant my prayer as to
that religious.  He bade me repeat certain words to him.  This I
felt much, because I knew not how to speak to him; for this
carrying messages to a third person, as I have said, [6] is what
I have always felt the most, especially when I did not know how
that person would take them, nor whether he would not laugh at
me.  This placed me in great difficulties, but at last I was so
convinced I ought to do it, that I believe I made a promise to
God I would not neglect that message; and because of the great
shame I felt, I wrote it out, and gave it in that way.
The result showed clearly enough that it was a message from God,
for that religious resolved with great earnestness to give
himself to prayer, though he did not do so at once.  Our Lord
would have him for Himself, so He sent me to tell him certain
truths which, without my understanding them, were so much to the
purpose that he was astonished.  Our Lord must have prepared him
to receive them as from His Majesty; and though I am but a
miserable sinner myself, yet I made many supplications to our
Lord to convert him thoroughly, and to make him hate the
pleasures and the things of this life.  And so he did--blessed be
God!--for every time that he spoke to me I was in a manner beside
myself; and if I had not seen it, I should never have believed
that our Lord would have given him in so short a time graces so
matured, and filled him so full of God, that he seemed to be
alive to nothing on earth.

14. May His Majesty hold him in His hand!  If he will go on--and
I trust in our Lord he will do so, now that he is so well
grounded in the knowledge of himself--he will be one of the most
distinguished servants of God, to the great profit of many souls,
because he has in a short time had great experience in spiritual
things: that is a gift of God, which He gives when He will and as
He will, and it depends not on length of time nor extent of
service.  I do not mean that time and service, are not great
helps, but very often our Lord will not give to some in twenty
years the grace of contemplation, while He gives it to others in
one,--His Majesty knoweth why.  We are under a delusion when we
think that in the course of years we shall come to the knowledge
of that which we can in no way attain to but by experience; and
thus many are in error, as I have said [7] when they would
understand spirituality without being spiritual themselves.  I do
not mean that a man who is not spiritual, if he is learned, may
not direct one that is spiritual; but it must be understood that
in outward and inward things, in the order of nature, the
direction must be an act of reason; and in supernatural things,
according to the teaching of the sacred writings.  In other
matters, let him not distress himself, nor think that he can
understand that which he understandeth not; neither let him
quench the Spirit; [8] for now another Master, greater than he,
is directing these souls, so that they are not left without
authority over them.

15. He must not be astonished at this, nor think it impossible:
all things are possible to our Lord; [9] he must strive rather to
strengthen his faith, and humble himself, because in this matter
our Lord imparts perhaps a deeper knowledge to some old woman
than to him, though he may be a very learned man.  Being thus
humble, he will profit souls and himself more than if he affected
to be a contemplative without being so; for, I repeat it, if he
have no experience, if he have not a most profound humility,
whereby he may see that he does not understand, and that the
thing is not for that reason impossible, he will do himself but
little good, and still less to his penitent.  But if he is
humble, let him have no fear that our Lord will allow either the
one or the other to fall into delusion.

16. Now as to this father I am speaking of, as our Lord has given
him light in many things, so has he laboured to find out by study
that which in this matter can be by study ascertained; for he is
a very learned man, and that of which he has no experience
himself he seeks to find out from those who have it,--and our
Lord helps him by increasing his faith, and so he has greatly
benefited himself and some other souls, of whom mine is one.
As our Lord knew the trials I had to undergo, His Majesty seems
to have provided that, when He took away unto Himself some of
those who directed me, others might remain, who helped me in my
great afflictions, and rendered me great services.

17. Our Lord wrought a complete change in this father, so much so
that he scarcely knew himself, so to speak.  He has given him
bodily health, so that he may do penance, such as he never had
before; for he was sickly.  He has given him courage to undertake
good works, with other gifts, so that he seems to have received a
most special vocation from our Lord.  May He be blessed for ever!

18. All these blessings, I believe, came to him through the
graces our Lord bestowed upon him in prayer; for they are real.
It has been our Lord's pleasure already to try him in certain
difficulties, out of which he has come forth like one who knows
the true worth of that merit which is gained by suffering
persecutions.  I trust in the munificence of our Lord that great
good will, by his means, accrue to some of his Order and to the
Order itself.  This is beginning to be understood.  I have had
great visions on the subject, and our Lord has told me wonderful
things of him and of the Rector of the Society of Jesus, whom I
am speaking of, [10] and also of two other religious of the Order
of St. Dominic, particularly of one who, to his own profit, has
actually learned of our Lord certain things which I had formerly
understood of him.  But there were greater things made known of
him to whom I am now referring: one of them I will now relate.

19. I was with him once in the parlour, when in my soul and
spirit I felt what great love burned within him, and became as it
were lost in ecstasy by considering the greatness of God, who had
raised that soul in so short a time to a state so high.  It made
me ashamed of myself when I saw him listen with so much humility
to what I was saying about certain matters of prayer, when I had
so little myself that I could speak on the subject to one like
him.  Our Lord must have borne with me in this on account of the
great desire I had to see that religious making great progress.
My interview with him did me great good,--it seems as if it left
a new fire in my soul, burning with desire to serve our Lord as
in the beginning.  O my Jesus! what is a soul on fire with Thy
love!  How we ought to prize it, and implore our Lord to let it
live long upon earth!  He who has this love should follow after
such souls, if it be possible.

20. It is a great thing for a person ill of this disease to find
another struck down by it,--it comforts him much to see that he
is not alone; they help one another greatly to suffer and to
merit.  They are strong with a double strength who are resolved
to risk a thousand lives for God, and who long for an opportunity
of losing them.  They are like soldiers who, to acquire booty,
and therewith enrich themselves, wish for war, knowing well that
they cannot become rich without it.  This is their work--to
suffer.  Oh, what a blessing it is when our Lord gives light to
understand how great is the gain of suffering for Him!  This is
never understood till we have left all things; for if anybody is
attached to any one thing, that is a proof that he sets some
value upon it; and if he sets any value upon it, it is painful to
be compelled to give it up.  In that case, everything is
imperfect and lost.  The saying is to the purpose here,--he who
follows what is lost, is lost himself; and what greater loss,
what greater blindness, what greater calamity, can there be than
making much of that which is nothing!

21. I now return to that which I had begun to speak of.  I was in
the greatest joy, beholding that soul.  It seemed as if our Lord
would have me see clearly the treasures He had laid up in it; and
so, when I considered the favour our Lord had shown me, in that I
should be the means of so great a good, I recognised my own
unworthiness for such an end.  I thought much of the graces our
Lord had given him, and held myself as indebted for them more
than if they had been given to myself.  So I gave thanks to our
Lord, when I saw that His Majesty had fulfilled my desires and
heard my petition that He would raise up persons like him.
And now my soul, no longer able to bear the joy that filled it,
went forth out of itself, losing itself that it might gain the
more. It lost sight of the reflections it was making; and the
hearing of that divine language which the Holy Ghost seemed to
speak threw me into a deep trance, which almost deprived me of
all sense, though it did not last long.  I saw Christ, in
exceeding great majesty and glory, manifesting His joy at what
was then passing.  He told me as much, and it was His pleasure
that I should clearly see that He was always present at similar
interviews, and how much He was pleased when people thus found
their delight in speaking of Him.

22. On another occasion, when far away from this place, I saw him
carried by angels in great glory.  I understood by that vision
that his soul was making great progress: so it was; for an evil
report was spread abroad against him by one to whom he had
rendered a great service, and whose reputation and whose soul he
had saved.  He bore it with much joy.  He did also other things
greatly to the honour of God, and underwent more persecutions.
I do not think it expedient now to speak further on this point;
if, however, you, my father, who know all, should hereafter think
otherwise, more might be said to the glory of our Lord.

23. All the prophecies spoken of before, [11] relating to this
house, as well as others, of which I shall speak hereafter,
relating to it and to other matters, have been accomplished.
Some of them our Lord revealed to me three years before they
became known, others earlier and others later.  But I always made
them known to my confessor, and to the widow my friend; for I had
leave to communicate with her, as I said before. [12]  She, I
know, repeated them to others, and these know that I lie not.
May God never permit me, in any matter whatever,--much more in
things of this importance,--to say anything but the whole truth!

24. One of my brothers-in-law [13] died suddenly; and as I was in
great distress at this, because he had no opportunity of making
his confession, our Lord said to me in prayer that my sister also
was to die in the same way; that I must go to her, and make her
prepare herself for such an end.  I told this to my confessor;
but as he would not let me go, I heard the same warning again;
and now, when he saw this, he told me I might go, and that I
should lose nothing by going.  My sister was living in the
country; and as I did not tell her why I came, I gave her what
light I could in all things.  I made her go frequently to
confession, and look to her soul in everything.  She was very
good, and did as I asked her.  Four or five years after she had
begun this practice, and keeping a strict watch over her
conscience, she died, with nobody near her, and without being
able to go to confession.  This was a blessing to her, for it was
little more than a week since she had been to her accustomed
confession.  It was a great joy to me when I heard of her death.
She was but a short time in purgatory.

25. I do not think it was quite eight days afterwards when, after
Communion, our Lord appeared to me, and was pleased that I should
see Him receive my sister into glory.  During all those years,
after our Lord had spoken to me, until her death, what I then
learnt with respect to her was never forgotten either by myself
or by my friend, who, when my sister was thus dead, came to me in
great amazement at the fulfilment of the prophecy.  God be
praised for ever, who takes such care of souls that they may not
be lost!

no observation on the alleged discrepancy between the MS. and the
printed text.  The observation of F. Bouix, however, is more
important, and deserves credit,--for Don Vicente may have failed,
through mere inadvertence, to see what F. Bouix saw; and it is
also to be remembered that Don Vicente does not say that the
MS. on this point has been so closely inspected as to throw any
doubt on the positive testimony of F. Bouix.  Six years after
this note was written Don Vicente published a facsimile by
photography of the original text in the handwriting of the Saint,

Chapter XXXV.


The Foundation of the House of St. Joseph.  The Observation of
Holy Poverty Therein.  How the Saint Left Toledo.


1. When I was staying with this lady, [1] already spoken of, in
whose house I remained more than six months, our Lord ordained
that a holy woman [2] of our Order should hear of me, who was
more than seventy leagues away from the place.  She happened to
travel this way, and went some leagues out of her road that she
might see me.  Our Lord had moved her in the same year, and in
the same month of the year, that He had moved me, to found
another monastery of the Order; and as He had given her this
desire, she sold all she possessed, and went to Rome to obtain
the necessary faculties.  She went on foot, and barefooted.
She is a woman of great penance and prayer, and one to whom our
Lord gave many graces; and our Lady appeared to her, and
commanded her to undertake this work.  Her progress in the
service of our Lord was so much greater than mine, that I was
ashamed to stand in her presence.  She showed me Briefs she
brought from Rome, and during the fortnight she remained with me
we laid our plan for the founding of these monasteries.

2. Until I spoke to her, I never knew that our rule, before it
was mitigated, required of us that we should possess nothing; [3]
nor was I going to found a monastery without revenue, [4] for my
intention was that we should be without anxiety about all that
was necessary for us, and I did not think of the many anxieties
which the possession of property brings in its train.  This holy
woman, taught of our Lord, perfectly understood--though she could
not read--what I was ignorant of, notwithstanding my having read
the Constitutions [5] so often; and when she told me of it, I
thought it right, though I feared they would never consent to
this, but would tell me I was committing follies, and that I
ought not to do anything whereby I might bring suffering upon
others.  If this concerned only myself, nothing should have kept
me back,--on the contrary, it would have been my great joy to
think that I was observing the counsels of Christ our Lord; for
His Majesty had already given me great longings for poverty. [6]

3. As for myself, I never doubted that this was the better part;
for I had now for some time wished it were possible in my state
to go about begging, for the love of God--to have no house of my
own, nor anything else.  But I was afraid that others--if our
Lord did not give them the same desire--might live in discontent.
Moreover, I feared that it might be the cause of some
distraction: for I knew some poor monasteries not very
recollected, and I did not consider that their not being
recollected was the cause of their poverty, and that their
poverty was not the cause of their distraction: distraction never
makes people richer, and God never fails those who serve Him.
In short, I was weak in faith; but not so this servant of God.

4. As I took the advice of many in everything, I found scarcely
any one of this opinion--neither my confessor, nor the learned
men to whom I spoke of it.  They gave me so many reasons the
other way, that I did not know what to do.  But when I saw what
the rule required, and that poverty was the more perfect way, I
could not persuade myself to allow an endowment.  And though they
did persuade me now and then that they were right, yet, when I
returned to my prayer, and saw Christ on the cross, so poor and
destitute, I could not bear to be rich, and I implored Him with
tears so to order matters that I might be poor as He was.

5. I found that so many inconveniences resulted from an
endowment, and saw that it was the cause of so much trouble, and
even distraction, that I did nothing but dispute with the
learned.  I wrote to that Dominican friar [7] who was helping us,
and he sent back two sheets by way of reply, full of objections
and theology against my plan, telling me that he had thought much
on the subject.  I answered that, in order to escape from my
vocation, the vow of poverty I had made, and the perfect
observance of the counsels of Christ, I did not want any theology
to help me, and in this case I should not thank him for his
learning.  If I found any one who would help me, it pleased me
much.  The lady in whose house I was staying was a great help to
me in this matter.  Some at first told me that they agreed with
me; afterwards, when they had considered the matter longer, they
found in it so many inconveniences that they insisted on my
giving it up.  I told them that, though they changed their
opinion so quickly, I would abide by the first.

6. At this time, because of my entreaties,--for the lady had
never seen the holy friar, Peter of Alcantara,--it pleased our
Lord to bring him to her house.  As he was a great lover of
poverty, and had lived in it for so many years, he knew well the
treasures it contains, and so he was a great help to me; he
charged me on no account whatever to give up my purpose.
Now, having this opinion and sanction,--no one was better able to
give it, because he knew what it was by long experience,--I  made
up my mind to seek no further advice.

7. One day, when I was very earnestly commending the matter to
God, our Lord told me that I must by no means give up my purpose
of founding the monastery in poverty; it was His will, and the
will of His Father: He would help me.  I was in a trance; and the
effects were such, that I could have no doubt it came from God.
On another occasion, He said to me that endowments bred
confusion, with other things in praise of poverty; and assured me
that whosoever served Him would never be in want of the necessary
means of living: and this want, as I have said, [8] I never
feared myself.  Our Lord changed the dispositions also of the
licentiate,--I am speaking of the Dominican friar, [9]--who, as I
said, wrote to me that I should not found the monastery without
an endowment.  Now, I was in the greatest joy at hearing this;
and having these opinions in my favour, it seemed to me nothing
less than the possession of all the wealth of the world, when I
had resolved to live in poverty for the love of God.

8. At this time, my Provincial withdrew the order and the
obedience, in virtue of which I was staying in that house. [10]
He left it to me to do as I liked: if I wished to return I might
do so; if I wished to remain I might also do so for a certain
time. But during that time the elections in my monastery [11]
would take place and I was told that many of the nuns wished to
lay on me the burden of superiorship.  The very thought of this
alone was a great torment to me; for though I was resolved to
undergo readily any kind of martyrdom for God, I could not
persuade myself at all to accept this; for, putting aside the
great trouble it involved,--because the nuns were so many,--and
other reasons, such as that I never wished for it, nor for any
other office,--on the contrary, had always refused them,--it
seemed to me that my conscience would be in great danger; and so
I praised God that I was not then in my convent.  I wrote to my
friends and asked them not to vote for me.

9. When I was rejoicing that I was not in that trouble, our Lord
said to me that I was on no account to keep away; that as I
longed for a cross, there was one ready for me, and that a heavy
one: that I was not to throw it away, but go on with resolution;
He would help me, and I must go at once.  I was very much
distressed, and did nothing but weep, because I thought that my
cross was to be the office of prioress; and, as I have just said,
I could not persuade myself that it would be at all good for my
soul--nor could I see any means by which it would be.  I told my
confessor of it, and he commanded me to return at once: that to
do so was clearly the most perfect way; and that, because the
heat was very great,--it would be enough if I arrived before the
election,--I might wait a few days, in order that my journey
might do me no harm.

10. But our Lord had ordered it otherwise.  I had to go at once,
because the uneasiness I felt was very great; and I was unable to
pray, and thought I was failing in obedience to the commandments
of our Lord, and that as I was happy and contented where I was, I
would not go to meet trouble.  All my service of God there was
lip-service: why did I, having the opportunity of living in
greater perfection, neglect it?  If I died on the road, let me
die.  Besides, my soul was in great straits, and our Lord had
taken from me all sweetness in prayer.  In short, I was in such a
state of torment, that I begged the lady to let me go; for my
confessor, when he saw the plight I was in, had already told me
to go, God having moved him as He had moved me.  The lady felt my
departure very much, and that was another pain to bear; for it
had cost her much trouble, and diverse importunities of the
Provincial, to have me in her house.

11. I considered it a very great thing for her to have given her
consent, when she felt it so much; but, as she was a person who
feared God exceedingly,--and as I told her, among many other
reasons, that my going away tended greatly to His service, and
held out the hope that I might possibly return,--she gave way,
but with much sorrow.  I was now not sorry myself at coming away,
for I knew that it was an act of greater perfection, and for the
service of God.  So the pleasure I had in pleasing God took away
the pain of quitting that lady,--whom I saw suffering so
keenly,--and others to whom I owed much, particularly my
confessor of the Society of Jesus, in whom I found all I needed.
But the greater the consolations I lost for our Lord's sake, the
greater was my joy in losing them.  I could not understand it,
for I had a clear consciousness of these two contrary
feelings--pleasure, consolation, and joy in that which weighed
down my soul with sadness.  I was joyful and tranquil, and had
opportunities of spending many hours in prayer; and I saw that I
was going to throw myself into a fire; for our Lord had already
told me that I was going to carry a heavy cross,--though I never
thought it would be so heavy as I afterwards found it to be,--yet
I went forth rejoicing.  I was distressed because I had not
already begun the fight, since it was our Lord's will that I
should be in it.  Thus His Majesty gave me strength, and
established it in my weakness. [12]

12. As I have just said, I could not understand how this could
be.  I thought of this illustration: if I were possessed of a
jewel, or any other thing which gave me great pleasure, and it
came to my knowledge that a person whom I loved more than myself,
and whose satisfaction I preferred to my own, wished to have it,
it would give me great pleasure to deprive myself of it, because
I would give all I possessed to please that person.  Now, as the
pleasure of giving pleasure to that person surpasses any pleasure
I have in that jewel myself, I should not be distressed in giving
away that or anything else I loved, nor at the loss of that
pleasure which the possession of it gave me.  So now, though I
wished to feel some distress when I saw that those whom I was
leaving felt my going so much, yet, notwithstanding my naturally
grateful disposition,--which, under other circumstances, would
have been enough to have caused me great pain,--at this time,
though I wished to feel it, I could feel none.

13. The delay of another day was so serious a matter in the
affairs of this holy house, that I know not how they would have
been settled if I had waited.  Oh, God is great!  I am often lost
in wonder when I consider and see the special help which His
Majesty gave me towards the establishment of this little cell of
God,--for such I believe it to be,--the lodging wherein His
Majesty delights; for once, when I was in prayer, He told me that
this house was the paradise of his delight. [13]  It seems, then,
that His Majesty has chosen these whom he has drawn hither, among
whom I am living very much ashamed of myself. [14]  I could not
have even wished for souls such as they are for the purpose of
this house, where enclosure, poverty, and prayer are so strictly
observed; they submit with so much joy and contentment, that
every one of them thinks herself unworthy of the grace of being
received into it,--some of them particularly; for our Lord has
called them out of the vanity and dissipation of the world, in
which, according to its laws, they might have lived contented.
Our Lord has multiplied their joy, so that they see clearly how
He had given them a hundredfold for the one thing they have
left, [15] and for which they cannot thank His Majesty enough.
Others He has advanced from well to better.  To the young He
gives courage and knowledge, so that they may desire nothing
else, and also to understand that to live away from all things in
this life is to live in greater peace even here below.  To those
who are no longer young, and whose health is weak, He gives--and
has given--the strength to undergo the same austerities and
penance with all the others.

14. O my Lord! how Thou dost show Thy power!  There is no need to
seek reasons for Thy will; for with Thee, against all natural
reason, all things are possible: so that thou teachest clearly
there is no need of anything but of loving Thee [16] in earnest,
and really giving up everything for Thee, in order that Thou, O
my Lord, might make everything easy.  It is well said that Thou
feignest to make Thy law difficult: [17] I do not see it, nor do
I feel that the way that leadeth unto Thee is narrow. I see it as
a royal road, and not a pathway; a road upon which whosoever
really enters, travels most securely.  No mountain passes and no
cliffs are near it: these are the occasions of sin. I call that a
pass,--a dangerous pass,--and a narrow road, which has on one
side a deep hollow, into which one stumbles, and on the other a
precipice, over which they who are careless fall, and are dashed
to pieces.  He who loves Thee, O my God, travels safely by the
open and royal road, far away from the precipice: he has scarcely
stumbled at all, when Thou stretchest forth Thy hand to save him.
One fall--yea, many falls--if he does but love Thee, and not the
things of the world, are not enough to make him perish; he
travels in the valley of humility.  I cannot understand what it
is that makes men afraid of the way of perfection.

15. May our Lord of His mercy make us see what a poor security we
have in the midst of dangers so manifest, when we live like the
rest of the world; and that true security consists in striving to
advance in the way of God!  Let us fix our eyes upon Him, and
have no fear that the Sun of justice will ever set, or suffer us
to travel to our ruin by night, unless we first look away from
Him.  People are not afraid of living in the midst of lions,
every one of whom seems eager to tear them: I am speaking of
honours, pleasures, and the like joys, as the world calls them:
and herein the devil seems to make us afraid of ghosts.  I am
astonished a thousand times, and ten thousand times would I
relieve myself by weeping, and proclaim aloud my own great
blindness and wickedness, if, perchance, it might help in some
measure to open their eyes.  May He, who is almighty, of His
goodness open their eyes, and never suffer mine to be
blind again!


1. Doña Luisa de la Cerda.

2. Maria of Jesus was the daughter of a Reporter of Causes in the
Chancery of Granada; but his name and that of his wife are not
known.  Maria married, but became a widow soon afterwards.
She then became a novice in the Carmelite monastery in Granada,
and during her noviciate had revelations, like those of
St. Teresa, about a reform of the Order.  Her confessor made
light of her revelations, and she then referred them to F. Gaspar
de Salazar, a confessor of St. Teresa, who was then in Granada.
He approved of them, and Maria left the noviciate, and went to
Rome with two holy women of the Order of St. Francis.  The three
made the journey on foot, and, moreover, barefooted.  Pope Pius
IV. heard her prayer, and, looking at her torn and bleeding feet,
said to her, "Woman of strong courage, let it be as thou wilt."
She returned to Granada, but both the Carmelites and the city
refused her permission to found her house there, and some went so
far as to threaten to have her publicly whipped.  Doña Leonor de
Mascareñas gave her a house in Alcala de Henares, of which she
took possession Sept. 11, 1562; but the house was formally
constituted July 23, 1563, and subjected to the Bishop ten days
after (Reforma, i. c. 59; and Don Vicente, vol. i. p. 255).
The latter says that the Chronicler is in error when he asserts
that this monastery of Maria of Jesus was endowed.

Incarnation must have been the Constitutions grounded on the

16. When the workmen were busy with the building, a nephew of the
Saint, the child of her sister and Don Juan de Ovalle, was struck
by some falling stones and killed.  The workmen took the child to
his mother: and the Saint, then in the house of Doña Guiomar de
Ulloa, was sent for.  Doña Guiomar took the dead boy into her
arms, gave him to the Saint, saying that it was a grievous blow
to the father and mother, and that she must obtain his life from
God.  The Saint took the body, and, laying it in her lap, ordered
those around her to cease their lamentations, of whom her sister
was naturally the loudest, and be silent.  Then, covering her
face and her body with her veil, she prayed to God, and God gave
the child his life again.  The little boy soon after ran up to
his aunt and thanked her for what she had done. In after years
the child used to say to the Saint that, as she had deprived him
of the bliss of heaven by bringing him back to life, she was
bound to see that he did not suffer loss.  Don Gonzalo died three
years after St. Teresa, when he was twenty-eight years of age
(Reforma, i. c. 42, § 2).

Chapter XXXVI.


The Foundation of the Monastery of St. Joseph.
Persecution and Temptations.  Great Interior Trial of the Saint,
and Her Deliverance.


1. Having now left that city, [1] I travelled in great joy,
resolved to suffer most willingly whatever our Lord might be
pleased to lay upon me.  On the night of my arrival here, [2]
came also from Rome the commission and the Brief for the erection
of the monastery. [3]  I was astonished myself, and so were those
who knew how our Lord hastened my coming, when they saw how
necessary it was, and in what a moment our Lord had brought me
back. [4]  I found here the Bishop and the holy friar, [5] Peter
of Alcantara, and that nobleman, [6] the great servant of God, in
whose house the holy man was staying; for he was a man who was in
the habit of receiving the servants of God in his house.
These two prevailed on the Bishop to accept the monastery, which
was no small thing, because it was founded in poverty; but he was
so great a lover of those whom he saw determined to serve our
Lord, that he was immediately drawn to give them His protection.
It was the approbation of the holy old man, [7] and the great
trouble he took to make now this one, now that one, help us, that
did the whole work.  If I had not come at the moment, as I have
just said, I do not see how it could have been done; for the holy
man was here but a short time,--I think not quite eight
days,--during which he was also ill; and almost immediately
afterwards our Lord took him to Himself. [8]  It seems as if His
Majesty reserved him till this affair was ended, because now for
some time--I think for more than two years--he had been very ill.

2. Everything was done in the utmost secrecy; and if it had not
been so, I do not see how anything could have been done at all;
for the people of the city were against us, as it appeared
afterwards.  Our Lord ordained that one of my brothers-in-law [9]
should be ill, and his wife away, and himself in such straits
that my superiors gave me leave to remain with him.
Nothing, therefore, was found out, though some persons had their
suspicions;--still, they did not believe.  It was very wonderful,
for his illness lasted only no longer than was necessary for our
affair; and when it was necessary he should recover his health,
that I might be disengaged, and he leave the house empty, our
Lord restored him; and he was astonished at it himself. [10]

3. I had much trouble in persuading this person and that to allow
the foundation; I had to nurse the sick man, and obtain from the
workmen the hasty preparation of the house, so that it might have
the form of a monastery; but much remained still to be done.
My friend was not here, [11] for we thought it best she should be
away, in order the better to hide our purpose.  I saw that
everything depended on haste, for many, reasons, one of which was
that I was afraid I might be ordered back to my monastery at any
moment.  I was troubled by so many things, that I suspected my
cross had been sent me, though it seemed but a light one in
comparison with that which I understood our Lord meant me
to carry.

4. When everything was settled, our Lord was pleased that some of
us should take the habit on St. Bartholomew's Day.  The most Holy
Sacrament began to dwell in the house at the same time. [12]
With full sanction and authority, then, our monastery of our most
glorious father St. Joseph was founded in the year 1562. [13]
I was there myself to give the habit, with two nuns [14] of the
house to which we belonged, who happened then to be absent from
it.  As the house which thus became a monastery was that of my
brother-in-law--I said before [15] that he had bought it, for the
purpose of concealing our plan--I was there myself with the
permission of my superiors; and I did nothing without the advice
of learned men, in order that I might not break, in a single
point, my vow of obedience.  As these persons considered what I
was doing to be most advantageous for the whole Order, on many
accounts, they told me--though I was acting secretly, and taking
care my superiors should know nothing--that I might go on.
If they had told me that there was the slightest imperfection in
the whole matter, I would have given up the founding of a
thousand monasteries,--how much more, then, this one!  I am
certain of this; for though I longed to withdraw from everything
more and more, and to follow my rule and vocation in the greatest
perfection and seclusion, yet I wished to do so only
conditionally: for if I should have learnt that it would be for
the greater honour of our Lord to abandon it, I would have done
so, as I did before on one occasion, [16] in all peace
and contentment.

5. I felt as if I were in bliss, when I saw the most Holy
Sacrament reserved, with four poor orphans, [17]--for they were
received without a dowry,--and great servants of God, established
in the house.  It was our aim from the beginning to receive only
those who, by their example, might be the foundation on which we
could build up what we had in view--great perfection and
prayer--and effect a work which I believed to be for the service
of our Lord, and to the honour of the habit of His glorious
Mother. This was my anxiety.  It was also a great consolation to
me that I had done that which our Lord had so often commanded me
to do, and that there was one church more in this city dedicated
to my glorious father St. Joseph.  Not that I thought I had done
anything myself, for I have never thought so, and do not think so
even now; I always looked upon it as the work of our Lord.
My part in it was so full of imperfections, that I look upon
myself rather as a person in fault than as one to whom any thanks
are due.  But it was a great joy to me when I saw His Majesty
make use of me, who am so worthless, as His instrument in so
grand a work.  I was therefore in great joy,--so much so, that I
was, as it were, beside myself, lost in prayer.

6. When all was done--it might have been about three or four
hours afterwards--Satan returned to the spiritual fight against
me, as I shall now relate.  He suggested to me that perhaps I had
been wrong in what I had done; perhaps I had failed in my
obedience, in having brought it about without the commandment of
the Provincial.  I did certainly think that the Provincial would
be displeased because I had placed the monastery under the
jurisdiction of the Bishop [18] without telling him of it
beforehand; though, as he would not acknowledge the monastery
himself, and as I had not changed mine, it seemed to me that
perhaps he would not care much about the matter.  Satan also
suggested whether the nuns would be contented to live in so
strict a house, whether they could always find food, whether I
had not done a silly thing, and what had I to do with it, when I
was already in a monastery?  All our Lord had said to me, all the
opinions I had heard, and all the prayers which had been almost
uninterrupted for more than two years, were completely blotted
out of my memory, just as if they had never been.  The only thing
I remembered was my own opinion; and every virtue, with faith
itself, was then suspended within me, so that I was without
strength to practise any one of them, or to defend myself against
so many blows.

7. The devil also would have me ask myself how I could think of
shutting myself up in so strict a house, when I was subject to so
many infirmities; how could I bear so penitential a life, and
leave a house large and pleasant, where I had been always so
happy, and where I had so many friends?--perhaps I might not like
those of the new monastery; I had taken on myself a heavy
obligation, and might possibly end in despair.  He also suggested
that perhaps it was he himself who had contrived it, in order to
rob me of my peace and rest, so that, being unable to pray, I
might be disquieted, and so lose my soul.  Thoughts of this kind
he put before me; and they were so many, that I could think of
nothing else; and with them came such distress, obscurity, and
darkness of soul as I can never describe.  When I found myself in
this state, I went and placed myself before the most Holy
Sacrament, though I could not pray to Him; so great was my
anguish, that I was like one in the agony of death.  I could not
make the matter known to any one, because no confessor had as yet
been appointed.

8. O my God, how wretched is this life!  No joy is lasting;
everything is liable to change.  Only a moment ago, I do not
think I would have exchanged my joy with any man upon earth; and
the very grounds of that joy so tormented me now, that I knew not
what to do with myself.  Oh, if we did but consider carefully the
events of our life, every one of us would learn from experience
how little we ought to make either of its pleasures or of its
pains!  Certainly this was, I believe, one of the most
distressing moments I ever passed in all my life; my spirit
seemed to forecast the great sufferings in store for me, though
they never were so heavy as this was, if it had continued.
But our Lord would not let His poor servant suffer, for in all my
troubles He never failed to succour me; so it was now.  He gave
me a little light, so that I might see it was the work of the
devil, and might understand the truth,--namely, that it was
nothing else but an attempt on his part to frighten me with his
lies.  So I began to call to mind my great resolutions to serve
our Lord, and my desire to suffer for His sake; and I thought
that if I carried them out, I must not seek to be at rest; that
if I had my trials, they would be meritorious; and that if I had
troubles, and endured them in order to please God, it would serve
me for purgatory.  What was I, then, afraid of?  If I longed for
tribulations, I had them now; and my gain lay in the greatest
opposition.  Why, then, did I fail in courage to serve One to
whom I owed so much?

9. After making these and other reflections, and doing great
violence to myself, I promised before the most Holy Sacrament to
do all in my power to obtain permission to enter this house, and,
if I could do it with a good conscience, to make a vow of
enclosure.  When I had done this, the devil fled in a moment, and
left me calm and peaceful, and I have continued so ever since;
and the enclosure, penances, and other rules of this house are to
me, in their observance, so singularly sweet and light, the joy I
have is so exceedingly great, that I am now and then thinking
what on earth I could have chosen which should be more
delightful.  I know not whether this may not be the cause of my
being in better health than I was ever before, or whether it be
that our Lord, because it is needful and reasonable that I should
do as all the others do, gives me this comfort of keeping the
whole rule, though with some difficulty.  However, all who know
my infirmities, are astonished at my strength.  Blessed be He who
giveth it all, and in whose strength I am strong!

10. Such a contest left me greatly fatigued, and laughing at
Satan; for I saw clearly it was he.  As I have never known what
it is to be discontented because I am a nun--no, not for an
instant--during more than twenty-eight years of religion, I
believe that our Lord suffered me to be thus tempted, that I
might understand how great a mercy He had shown me herein, and
from what torment He had delivered me, and that if I saw any one
in like trouble I might not be alarmed at it, but have pity on
her, and be able to console her.

11. Then, when this was over, I wished to rest myself a little
after our dinner; for during the whole of that night I had
scarcely rested at all, and for some nights previously I had had
much trouble and anxiety, while every day was full of toil; for
the news of what we had done had reached my monastery, and was
spread through the city.  There arose a great outcry, for the
reasons I mentioned before, [19] and there was some apparent
ground for it.  The prioress [20] sent for me to come to her
immediately.  When I received the order, I went at once, leaving
the nuns in great distress.  I saw clearly enough that there were
troubles before me; but as the work was really done, I did not
care much for that.  I prayed and implored our Lord to help me,
and my father St. Joseph to bring me back to his house.
I offered up to him all I was to suffer, rejoicing greatly that I
had the opportunity of suffering for his honour and of doing him
service.  I went persuaded that I should be put in prison at once
but this would have been a great comfort, because I should have
nobody to speak to, and might have some rest and solitude, of
which I was in great need; for so much intercourse with people
had worn me out.

12. When I came and told the prioress what I had done, she was
softened a little.  They all sent for the Provincial, and the
matter was reserved for him.  When he came, I was summoned to
judgment, rejoicing greatly at seeing that I had something to
suffer for our Lord.  I did not think I had offended against His
Majesty, or against my Order, in anything I had done; on the
contrary, I was striving with all my might to exalt my Order, for
which I would willingly have died,--for my whole desire was that
its rule might be observed in all perfection.  I thought of
Christ receiving sentence, and I saw how this of mine would be
less than nothing.  I confessed my fault, as if I had been very
much to blame; and so I seemed to every one who did not know all
the reasons.  After the Provincial had rebuked me sharply--though
not with the severity which my fault deserved, nor according to
the representations made to him--I would not defend myself, for I
was determined to bear it all; on the contrary, I prayed him to
forgive and punish, and be no longer angry with me.

13. I saw well enough that they condemned me on some charges of
which I was innocent, for they said I had founded the monastery
that I might be thought much of, and to make myself a name, and
for other reasons of that kind.  But on other points I understood
clearly that they were speaking the truth, as when they said that
I was more wicked than the other nuns.  They asked, how could I,
who had not kept the rule in that house, think of keeping it in
another of stricter observance?  They said I was giving scandal
in the city, and setting up novelties.  All this neither troubled
nor distressed me in the least, though I did seem to feel it,
lest I should appear to make light of what they were saying.

14. At last the Provincial commanded me to explain my conduct
before the nuns, and I had to do it.  As I was perfectly calm,
and our Lord helped me, I explained everything in such a way that
neither the Provincial nor those who were present found any
reason to condemn me.  Afterwards I spoke more plainly to the
Provincial alone; he was very much satisfied, and promised, if
the new monastery prospered, and the city became quiet, to give
me leave to live in it.  Now the outcry in the city was very
great, as I am going to tell.  Two or three days after this, the
governor, certain members of the council of the city and of the
Chapter, came together, and resolved that the new monastery
should not be allowed to exist, that it was a visible wrong to
the state, that the most Holy Sacrament should be removed, and
that they would not suffer us to go on with our work.

15. They assembled all the Orders--that is, two learned men from
each--to give their opinion.  Some were silent, others condemned;
in the end, they resolved that the monastery should be broken up.
Only one [21]--he was of the Order of St. Dominic, and objected,
not to the monastery itself, but to the foundation of it in
poverty--said that there was no reason why it should be thus
dissolved, that the matter ought to be well considered, that
there was time enough, that it was the affair of the bishop, with
other things of that kind.  This was of great service to us, for
they were angry enough to proceed to its destruction at once, and
it was fortunate they did not.  In short, the monastery must
exist; our Lord was pleased to have it, and all of them could do
nothing against His will.  They gave their reasons, and showed
their zeal for good, and thus, without offending God, made me
suffer together with all those who were in favour of the
monastery; there were not many, but they suffered much
persecution.  The inhabitants were so excited, that they talked
of nothing else; every one condemned me, and hurried to the
Provincial and to my monastery.

16. I was no more distressed by what they said of me than if they
had said nothing; but I was afraid the monastery would be
destroyed: that was painful; so also was it to see those persons
who helped me lose their credit and suffer so much annoyance.
But as to what was said of myself I was rather glad, and if I had
had any faith I should not have been troubled at all.  But a
slight failing in one virtue is enough to put all the others to
sleep. I was therefore extremely distressed during the two days
on which those assemblies of which I have spoken were held.
In the extremity of my trouble, our Lord said to me: "Knowest
thou not that I am the Almighty? what art thou afraid of?"
He made me feel assured that the monastery would not be broken
up, and I was exceedingly comforted.  The informations taken were
sent up to the king's council, and an order came back for a
report on the whole matter.

17. Here was the beginning of a grand lawsuit: the city sent
delegates to the court, and some must be sent also to defend the
monastery: but I had no money, nor did I know what to do.
Our Lord provided for us for the Father Provincial never ordered
me not to meddle in the matter.  He is so great a lover of all
that is good, that, though he did not help us, he would not be
against our work.  Neither did he authorise me to enter the house
till he saw how it would end.  Those servants of God who were in
it were left alone, and did more by their prayers than I did with
all my negotiations, though the affair needed the utmost
attention.  Now and then everything seemed to fail; particularly
one day, before the Provincial came, when the prioress ordered me
to meddle no more with it, and to give it up altogether.
I betook myself to God, and said, "O Lord, this house is not
mine; it was founded for Thee; and now that there is no one to
take up the cause, do Thou protect it."  I now felt myself in
peace, and as free from anxiety as if the whole world were on my
side in the matter; and at once I looked upon it as safe. [22]

18. A very great servant of God, and a lover of all perfection, a
priest [23] who had helped me always, went to the court on this
business, and took great pains.  That holy nobleman [24] of whom
I have often spoken laboured much on our behalf, and helped us in
every way.  He had much trouble and persecution to endure, and I
always found a father in him, and do so still.  All those who
helped us, our Lord filled with such fervour as made them
consider our affair as their own, as if their own life and
reputation were at stake; and yet it was nothing to them, except
in so far as it regarded the service of our Lord.  His Majesty
visibly helped the priest I have spoken of before, [25] who was
also one of those who gave us great help when the Bishop sent him
as his representative to one of the great meetings.  There he
stood alone against all; at last he pacified them by means of
certain propositions, which obtained us a little respite.
But that was not enough; for they were ready to spend their
lives, if they could but destroy the monastery.  This servant of
God was he who gave the habit and reserved the most Holy
Sacrament, and he was the object of much persecution.
This attack lasted about six months: to relate in detail the
heavy trials we passed through would be too tedious.

19. I wondered at what Satan did against a few poor women, and
also how all people thought that merely twelve women, with a
prioress, could be so hurtful to the city,--for they were not to
be more,--I say this to those who opposed us,--and living such
austere lives; for if any harm or error came of it, it would all
fall upon them.  Harm to the city there could not be in any way;
and yet the people thought there was so much in it, that they
opposed us with a good conscience.  At last they resolved they
would tolerate us if we were endowed, and in consideration of
that would suffer us to remain.  I was so distressed at the
trouble of all those who were on our side--more than at my
own--that I thought it would not be amiss, till the people were
pacified, to accept an endowment, but afterwards to resign it.
At other times, too, wicked and imperfect as I am, I thought that
perhaps our Lord wished it to be so, seeing that, without
accepting it, we could not succeed; and so I consented to
the compromise.

20. The night before the settlement was to be made, I was in
prayer,--the discussion of the terms of it had already
begun,--when our Lord said to me that I must do nothing of the
kind; for if we began with an endowment, they would never allow
us to resign it.  He said some other things also.  The same
night, the holy friar, Peter of Alcantara, appeared to me.
He was then dead. [26]  But he had written to me before his
death--for he knew the great opposition and persecution we had to
bear--that he was glad the foundation was so much spoken against;
it was a sign that our Lord would be exceedingly honoured in the
monastery, seeing that Satan was so earnest against it; and that
I was by no means to consent to an endowment.  He urged this upon
me twice or thrice in that letter, and said that if I persisted
in this everything would succeed according to my wish.

21. At this time I had already seen him twice since his death,
and the great glory he was in, and so I was not afraid,--on the
contrary, I was very glad; for he always appeared as a glorified
body in great happiness, and the vision made me very happy too.
I remember that he told me, the first time I saw him, among other
things, when speaking of the greatness of his joy, that the
penance he had done was a blessed thing for him, in that it had
obtained so great a reward.  But, as I think I have spoken of
this before, [27] I will now say no more than that he showed
himself severe on this occasion: he merely said that I was on no
account to accept an endowment, and asked why it was I did not
take his advice.  He then disappeared. I remained in
astonishment, and the next day told the nobleman--for I went to
him in all my trouble, as to one who did more than others for us
in the matter,--what had taken place, and charged him not to
consent to the endowment, but to let the lawsuit go on.  He was
more firm on this point than I was, and was therefore greatly
pleased; he told me afterwards how much he disliked
the compromise.

22. After this, another personage--a great servant of God, and
with good intentions--came forward, who, now that the matter was
in good train, advised us to put it in the hands of learned men.
This brought on trouble enough; for some of those who helped me
agreed to do so; and this plot of Satan was one of the most
difficult of all to unravel.  Our Lord was my helper throughout.
Writing thus briefly, it is impossible for me to explain what
took place during the two years that passed between the beginning
and the completion of the monastery: the last six months and the
first six months were the most painful.

23. When at last the city was somewhat calm, the licentiate
father, the Dominican friar [28] who helped us, exerted himself
most skilfully on our behalf.  Though not here at the time, our
Lord brought him here at a most convenient moment for our
service, and it seems that His Majesty brought him for that
purpose only.  He told me afterwards that he had no reasons for
coming, and that he heard of our affair as if by chance.
He remained here as long as we wanted him, and on going away he
prevailed, by some means, on the Father Provincial to permit me
to enter this house, and to take with me some of the
nuns [29]--such a permission seemed impossible in so short a time
for the performance of the Divine Office--and the training of
those who were in this house: the day of our coming was a most
joyful day for me. [30]

24. While praying in the church, before I went into the house,
and being as it were in a trance, I saw Christ; who, as it seemed
to me, received me with great affection, placed a crown on my
head, and thanked me for what I had done for His Mother.
On another occasion, when all of us remained in the choir in
prayer after Compline, I saw our Lady in exceeding glory, in a
white mantle, with which she seemed to cover us all.
I understood by that the high degree of glory to which our Lord
would raise the religious of this house.

25. When we had begun to sing the Office, the people began to
have a great devotion to the monastery; more nuns were received,
and our Lord began to stir up those who had been our greatest
persecutors to become great benefactors, and give alms to us.
In this way they came to approve of what they had condemned; and
so, by degrees, they withdrew from the lawsuit, and would say
that they now felt it to be a work of God, since His Majesty had
been pleased to carry it on in the face of so much opposition.
And now there is not one who thinks that it would have been right
not to have founded the monastery: so they make a point of
furnishing us with alms; for without any asking on our part,
without begging of any one, our Lord moves them to, succour us;
and so we always have what is necessary for us, and I trust in
our Lord it will always be so. [31]  As the sisters are few in
number, if they do their duty as our Lord at present by His grace
enables them to do, I am confident that they will always have it,
and that they need not be a burden nor troublesome to anybody;
for our Lord will care for them, as He has hitherto done.

26. It is the greatest consolation to me to find myself among
those who are so detached.  Their occupation is to learn how they
may advance in the service of God.  Solitude is their delight;
and the thought of being visited by any one, even of their
nearest kindred, is a trial, unless it helps them to kindle more
and more their love of the Bridegroom.  Accordingly, none come to
this house who do not aim at this; otherwise they neither give
nor receive any pleasure from their visits.  Their conversation
is of God only; and so he whose conversation is different does
not understand them, and they do not understand him.

27. We keep the rule of our Lady of Carmel, not the rule of the
Mitigation, but as it was settled by Fr. Hugo, Cardinal of Santa
Sabina, and given in the year 1248, in the fifth year of the
pontificate of Innocent IV., Pope.  All the trouble we had to go
through, as it seems to me, will have been endured to
good purpose.

28. And now, though the rule be somewhat severe,--for we never
eat flesh except in cases of necessity, fast eight months in the
year, and practise some other austerities besides, according to
the primitive rule, [32]--yet the sisters think it light on many
points, and so they have other observances, which we have thought
necessary for the more perfect keeping of it.  And I trust in our
Lord that what we have begun will prosper more and more,
according to the promise of His Majesty.

29. The other house, which the holy woman of whom I spoke
before [33] laboured to establish, has been also blessed of our
Lord, and is founded in Alcala: it did not escape serious
opposition, nor fail to endure many trials.  I know that all
duties of religion are observed in it, according to our primitive
rule.  Our Lord grant that all may be to the praise and glory of
Himself and of the glorious Virgin Mary, whose habit we
wear.  Amen.

30. I think you must be wearied, my father, by the tedious
history of this monastery; and yet it is most concise, if you
compare it with our labours, and the wonders which our Lord has
wrought here.  There are many who can bear witness to this on
oath.  I therefore beg of your reverence, for the love of God,
should you think fit to destroy the rest of this my writing, to
preserve that part of it which relates to this monastery, and
give it, when I am dead, to the sisters who may then be living in
it.  It will encourage them greatly, who shall come here both to
serve God and to labour, that what has been thus begun may not
fall to decay, but ever grow and thrive, when they see how much
our Lord has done through one so mean and vile as I.  As our Lord
has been so particularly gracious to us in the foundation of this
house it seems to me that she will do very wrong, and that she
will be heavily chastised of God, who shall be the first to relax
the perfect observance of the rule, which our Lord has here begun
and countenanced, so that it may be kept with so much sweetness:
it is most evident that the observance of it is easy, and that it
can be kept with ease, by the arrangement made for those who long
to be alone with their Bridegroom Christ, in order to live for
ever in Him.

31. This is to be the perpetual aim of those who are here, to be
alone with Him alone.  They are not to be more in number than
thirteen: I know this number to be the best, for I have had many
opinions about it; and I have seen in my own experience, that to
preserve our spirit, living on alms, without asking of anyone, a
larger number would be inexpedient.  May they always believe one
who with much labour, and by the prayers of many people,
accomplished that which must be for the best!  That this is most
expedient for us will be seen from the joy and cheerfulness, and
the few troubles, we have all had in the years we have lived in
this house, as well as from the better health than usual of us
all.  If any one thinks the rule hard, let her lay the fault on
her want of the true spirit, and not on the rule of the house,
seeing that delicate persons, and those not saints,--because they
have the true spirit,--can bear it all with so much sweetness.
Let others go to another monastery, where they may save their
souls in the way of their own spirit.


1. Toledo.

2. Avila.  In the beginning of June, 1562.

3. See ch. xxxiv. § 2.  The Brief was dated Feb. 7, 1562, the
third year of Pius IV. (De la Fuente).

4. The Brief was addressed to Doña Aldonza de Guzman, and to Doña
Guiomar de Ulloa, her daughter.

5. Don Alvaro de Mendoza (De la Fuente).

6. Don Francisco de Salcedo.

7. St. Peter of Alcantara.  "Truly this is the house of
St. Joseph," were the Saint's words when he saw the rising
monastery; "for I see it is the little hospice of Bethlehem" (De
la Fuente).

8. In less than three months, perhaps; for St. Peter died in the
sixty-third year of his age, Oct. 18, 1562, and in less than
eight weeks after the foundation of the monastery of St. Joseph.

9. Don Juan de Ovalle.

10. When he saw that the Saint had made all her arrangements, he
knew the meaning of his illness, and said to her, "It is not
necessary I should be ill any longer" (Ribera, i. c. 8).

11. Doña Guiomar de Ulloa was now in her native place,
Ciudad Toro.

12. The Mass was said by Gaspar Daza.  See infra, § 18; Reforma,
i. c. xlvi. § 3.

13. The bell which the Saint had provided for the convent weighed
less than three pounds, and remained in the monastery for a
hundred years, till it was sent, by order of the General, to the
monastery of Pastrana, where the general chapters were held.
There the friars assembled at the sound of the bell, which rang
for the first Mass of the Carmelite Reform (Reforma,
i. c. xlvi. § 1).

14. They were Doña Ines and Doña Ana de Tapia, cousins of the
Saint.  There were present also Don Gonzalo de Aranda, Don
Francisco Salcedo, Julian of Avila, priest; Doña Juana de
Ahumada, the Saint's sister; with her husband, Juan de Ovalle.
The Saint herself retained her own habit, making no change,
because she had not the permission of her superiors (Reforma,
i. c. xlvi. § 2).

15. Ch. xxxiii. § 13.

16. Ch. xxxiii. § 3.

17. The first of these was Antonia de Henao, a penitent of
St. Peter of Alcantara, and who wished to enter a religious house
far away from Avila, her home.  St. Peter kept her for
St. Teresa.  She was called from this day forth Antonia of the
Holy Ghost.  The second was Maria de la Paz, brought up by Doña
Guiomar de Ulloa.  Her name was Maria of the Cross.  The third
was Ursola de los Santos.  She retained her family name as Ursola
of the Saints.  It was Gaspar Daza who brought her to the Saint.
The fourth was Maria de Avila, sister of Julian the priest, and
she was called Mary of St. Joseph.  It was at this house, too,
that the Saint herself exchanged her ordinary designation of Doña
Teresa de Ahumada for Teresa of Jesus (Reforma, i. c. xlvi. § 2).

18. See Foundations, ch. ii. § 1, and ch. xxxi, § 1.

19. Ch. xxxiii. §§ 1, 2.

20. Of the Incarnation.

21. F. Domingo Bañes, the great commentator on St. Thomas.
On the margin of the MS., Bañes has with his own hand written:
"This was at the end of August, 1562.  I was present, and gave
this opinion.  I am writing this in May" (the day of the month is
not legible) "1575, and the mother has now founded nine
monasteries en gran religion" (De la Fuente).  At this time Bañes
did not know, and had never seen, the Saint; he undertook her
defence simply because he saw that her intentions were good, and
the means she made use of for founding the monastery lawful,
seeing that she had received the commandment to do so from the
Pope. Bañes testifies thus in the depositions made in Salamanca
in 1591 in the Saint's process.  See vol. ii. p. 376 of Don
Vicente's edition.

22. See Ch. xxxix. § 25.

23. Gonzalo de Aranda (De la Fuente).

24. Don Francisco de Salcedo (ibid.).

25. Ch. xxiii. § 6; Gaspar Daza (ibid.).

26. He died Oct. 18, 1562.

27. Ch. xxvii. § 21.

28. "El Padre Presentado, Dominico.  Presentado en algunas
Religiones es cierto titulo de grado que es respeto del Maestro
como Licenciado" (Cobarruvias, in voce Presente).  The father was
Fra Pedro Ibañez.  See ch. xxxviii. § 15.

29. From the monastery of the Incarnation.  These were Ana of
St. John, Ana of All the Angels, Maria Isabel, and Isabel of
St. Paul.  St. Teresa was a simple nun, living under obedience to
the prioress of St. Joseph, Ana of St. John, and intended so to
remain.  But the nuns applied to the Bishop of Avila and to the
Provincial of the Order, who, listening to the complaints of the
sisters, compelled the Saint to be their prioress.  See Reforma,
i. c. xlix. § 4.

30. Mid-Lent of 1563.

31. See Way of Perfection, ch. ii.

32. "Jejunium singulis diebus, exceptis Dominicis, observetis a
Festo Exaltationis Sanctæ Crucis usque ad diem Dominicæ
Resurrectionis, nisi infirmitas vel debilitas corporis, aut alia
justa causa, jejunium solvi suadeat; quia necessitas non habet
legem.  Ab esu carnium abstineatis, nisi pro infirmitatis aut
debilitatis remedio sint sumantur."  That is the tenth section of
the rule.

33. See ch. xxxv. § 1.  Maria of Jesus had founded her house in
Alcala de Henares; but the austerities practised in it, and the
absence of the religious mitigations which long experience had
introduced, were too much for the fervent nuns there assembled.
Maria of Jesus begged Doña Leonor de Mascareñas to persuade
St. Teresa to come to Alcala.  The Saint went to the monastery,
and was received there with joy, and even entreated to take the
house under her own government (Reforma, ii. c. x. §§ 3, 4).



Chapter XXXVII.


The Effects of the Divine Graces in the Soul.  The Inestimable
Greatness of One Degree of Glory.


1. It is painful to me to recount more of the graces which our
Lord gave me than these already spoken of; and they are so many,
that nobody can believe they were ever given to one so wicked:
but in obedience to our Lord, who has commanded me to do it, [1]
and you, my fathers, I will speak of some of them to His glory.
May it please His Majesty it may be to the profit of some soul!
For if our Lord has been thus gracious to so--miserable a thing
as myself, what will He be to those who shall serve Him truly?
Let all people resolve to please His Majesty, seeing that He
gives such pledges as these even in this life. [2]

2. In the first place, it must be understood that, in those
graces which God bestows on the soul, there are diverse degrees
of joy: for in some visions the joy and sweetness and comfort of
them so far exceed those of others, that I am amazed at the
different degrees of fruition even in this life; for it happens
that the joy and consolation which God gives in a vision or a
trance are so different, that it seems impossible for the soul to
be able to desire anything more in this world: and, so, in fact,
the soul does not desire, nor would it ask for, a greater joy.
Still, since our Lord has made me understand how great a
difference there is in heaven itself between the fruition of one
and that of another, I see clearly enough that here also, when
our Lord wills, He gives not by measure; [3] and so I wish that I
myself observed no measure in serving His Majesty, and in using
my whole life and strength and health therein; and I would not
have any fault of mine rob me of the slightest degree
of fruition.

3. And so I say that if I were asked which I preferred, to endure
all the trials of the world until the end of it, and then receive
one slight degree of glory additional, or without any suffering
of any kind to enter into glory of a slightly lower degree, I
would accept--oh, how willingly!--all those trials for one slight
degree of fruition in the contemplation of the greatness of God;
for I know that he who understands Him best, loves Him and
praises Him best.  I do not mean that I should not be satisfied,
and consider myself most blessed, to be in heaven, even if I
should be in the lowest place; for as I am one who had that place
in hell, it would be a great mercy of our Lord to admit me at
all; and may it please His Majesty to bring me thither, and take
away His eyes from beholding my grievous sins. What I mean is
this,--if it were in my power, even if it cost me everything, and
our Lord gave me the grace to endure much affliction, I would not
through any fault of mine lose one degree of glory.  Ah, wretched
that I am, who by so many faults had forfeited all!

4. It is also to be observed that, in every vision or revelation
which our Lord in His mercy sent me, a great gain accrued to my
soul, and that in some of the visions this gain was very great.
The vision of Christ left behind an impression of His exceeding
beauty, and it remains with me to this day.  One vision alone of
Him is enough to effect this; what, then, must all those visions
have done, which our Lord in His mercy sent me? One exceedingly
great blessing has resulted therefrom, and it is this,--I had one
very grievous fault, which was the source of much evil; namely,
whenever I found anybody well disposed towards myself, and I
liked him, I used to have such an affection for him as compelled
me always to remember and think of him, though I had no intention
of offending God: however, I was pleased to see him, to think of
him and of his good qualities.  All this was so hurtful, that it
brought my soul to the very verge of destruction.

5. But ever since I saw the great beauty [4] of our Lord, I never
saw any one who in comparison with Him seemed even endurable, or
that could occupy my thoughts.  For if I but turn mine eyes
inwardly for a moment to the contemplation of the image which I
have within me, I find myself so free, that from that instant
everything I see is loathsome in comparison with the excellences
and graces of which I had a vision in our Lord.  Neither is there
any sweetness, nor any kind of pleasure, which I can make any
account of, compared with that which comes from hearing but one
word from His divine mouth.  What, then, must it be when I hear
so many?  I look upon it as impossible--unless our Lord, for my
sins, should permit the loss of this remembrance--that I should
have the power to occupy myself with anything in such a way as
that I should not instantly recover my liberty by thinking of
our Lord.

6. This has happened to me with some of my confessors, for I
always have a great affection for those who have the direction of
my soul.  As I really saw in them only the representatives of
God, I thought my will was always there where it is most
occupied; and as I felt very safe in the matter, I always showed
myself glad to see them. [5]  They, on the other hand, servants
of God, and fearing Him, were afraid that I was attaching and
binding myself too much to them, though in a holy way, and
treated me with rudeness.  This took place after I had become so
ready to obey them; for before that time I had no affection
whatever for them.  I used to laugh to myself, when I saw how
much they were deceived.  Though I was not always putting before
them how little I was attached to anybody, as clearly as I was
convinced of it myself, yet I did assure them of it; and they, in
their further relations with me, acknowledged how much I owed to
our Lord in the matter.  These suspicions of me always arose in
the beginning.

7. My love of, and trust in, our Lord, after I had seen Him in a
vision, began to grow, for my converse with Him was so continual.
I saw that, though He was God, He was man also; that He is not
surprised at the frailties of men, that He understands our
miserable nature, liable to fall continually, because of the
first sin, for the reparation of which He had come.  I could
speak to Him as to a friend, though He is my Lord, because I do
not consider Him as one of our earthly Lords, who affect a power
they do not possess, who give audience at fixed hours, and to
whom only certain persons may speak.  If a poor man have any
business with these, it will cost him many goings and comings,
and currying favour with others, together with much pain and
labour before he can speak to them.  Ah, if such a one has
business with a king!  Poor people, not of gentle blood, cannot
approach him, for they must apply to those who are his friends,
and certainly these are not persons who tread the world under
their feet; for they who do this speak the truth, fear nothing,
and ought to fear nothing; they are not courtiers, because it is
not the custom of a court, where they must be silent about those
things they dislike, must not even dare to think about them, lest
they should fall into disgrace.

8. O King of glory, and Lord of all kings! oh, how Thy kingly
dignity is not hedged about by trifles of this kind!  Thy kingdom
is for ever.  We do not require chamberlains to introduce us into
Thy presence.  The very vision of Thy person shows us at once
that Thou alone art to be called Lord.  Thy Majesty is so
manifest that there is no need of a retinue or guard to make us
confess that Thou art King.  An earthly king without attendants
would be hardly acknowledged; and though he might wish ever so
much to be recognised, people will not own him when he appears as
others; it is necessary that his dignity should be visible, if
people are to believe in it.  This is reason enough why kings
should affect so much state; for if they had none, no one would
respect them; this their semblance of power is not in themselves,
and their authority must come to them from others.

9. O my Lord!  O my King! who can describe Thy Majesty?  It is
impossible not to see that Thou art Thyself the great Ruler of
all, that the beholding of Thy Majesty fills men with awe.  But I
am filled with greater awe, O my Lord, when I consider Thy
humility, and the love Thou hast for such as I am.  We can
converse and speak with Thee about everything whenever we will;
and when we lose our first fear and awe at the vision of Thy
Majesty, we have a greater dread of offending Thee,--not arising
out of the fear of punishment, O my Lord, for that is as nothing
in comparison with the loss of Thee!

10. Thus far of the blessings of this vision, without speaking of
others, which abide in the soul when it is past.  If it be from
God, the fruits thereof show it, when the soul receives light;
for, as I have often said, [6] the will of our Lord is that the
soul should be in darkness, and not see this light.  It is,
therefore, nothing to be wondered at that I, knowing myself to be
so wicked as I am, should be afraid.

11. It is only just now it happened to me to be for eight days in
a state wherein it seemed that I did not, and could not, confess
my obligations to God, or remember His mercies; but my soul was
so stupefied, and occupied with I know not what nor how: not that
I had any bad thoughts; only I was so incapable of good thoughts,
that I was laughing at myself, and even rejoicing to see how mean
a soul can be if God is not always working in it. [7]  The soul
sees clearly that God is not away from it in this state, and that
it is not in those  great tribulations which I have spoken of as
being occasionally mine.  Though it heaps up fuel, and does the
little it can do of itself, it cannot make the fire of the love
of God burn: it is a great mercy that even the smoke is visible,
showing that it is not altogether quenched.  Our Lord will return
and kindle it; and until then the soul--though it may lose its
breath in blowing and arranging the fuel--seems to be doing
nothing but putting it out more and more.

12. I believe that now the best course is to be absolutely
resigned, confessing that we can do nothing, and so apply
ourselves--as I said before [8]--to something else which is
meritorious.  Our Lord, it may be, takes away from the soul the
power of praying, that it may betake itself to something else,
and learn by experience how little it can do in its own strength.

13. It is true I have this day been rejoicing in our Lord, and
have dared to complain of His Majesty.  I said unto Him: How is
it, O my God, that it is not enough for Thee to detain me in this
wretched life, and that I should have to bear with it for the
love of Thee, and be willing to live where everything hinders the
fruition of Thee; where, besides, I must eat and sleep, transact
business, and converse with every one, and all for Thy love? how
is it, then,--for Thou well knowest, O my Lord, all this to be
the greatest torment unto me,--that, in the rare moments when I
am with Thee, Thou hidest Thyself from me?  How is this
consistent with Thy compassion?  How can that love Thou hast for
me endure this?  I believe, O Lord, if it were possible for me to
hide myself from Thee, as Thou hidest Thyself from me--I think
and believe so--such is Thy love, that Thou wouldest not endure
it at my hands.  But Thou art with me, and seest me always.  O my
Lord, I beseech Thee look to this; it must not be; a wrong is
done to one who loves Thee so much.

14. I happened to utter these words, and others of the same kind,
when I should have been thinking rather how my place in hell was
pleasant in comparison with the place I deserved.  But now and
then my love makes me foolish, so that I lose my senses; only it
is with all the sense I have that I make these complaints, and
our Lord bears it all.  Blessed be so good a King!

15. Can we be thus bold with the kings of this world?  And yet I
am not surprised that we dare not thus speak to a king, for it is
only reasonable that men should be afraid of him, or even to the
great lords who are his representatives.  The world is now come
to such a state, that men's lives ought to be longer than they
are if we are to learn all the new customs and ceremonies of good
breeding, and yet spend any time in the service of God.  I bless
myself at the sight of what is going on.  The fact is, I did not
know how I was to live when I came into this house.
Any negligence in being much more ceremonious with people than
they deserve is not taken as a jest; on the contrary, they look
upon it as an insult deliberately offered; so that it becomes
necessary for you to satisfy them of your good intentions, if
there happens, as I have said, to have been any negligence; and
even then, God grant they may believe you.

16. I repeat it,--I certainly did not know how to live; for my
poor soul was worn out.  It is told to employ all its thoughts
always on God, and that it is necessary to do so if it would
avoid many dangers.  On the other hand, it finds it will not do
to fail in any one point of the world's law, under the penalty of
affronting those who look upon these things as touching their
honour.  I was worn out in unceasingly giving satisfaction to
people; for, though I tried my utmost, I could not help failing
in many ways in matters which, as I have said, are not slightly
thought of in the world.

17. Is it true that in religious houses no explanations are
necessary, for it is only reasonable we should be excused these
observances?  Well, that is not so; for there are people who say
that monasteries ought to be courts in politeness and
instruction.  I certainly cannot understand it.  I thought that
perhaps some saint may have said that they ought to be courts to
teach those who wish to be the courtiers of heaven, and that
these people misunderstood their meaning; for if a man be careful
to please God continually, and to hate the world, as he ought to
do, I do not see how he can be equally careful to please those
who live in the world in these matters which are continually
changing.  If they could be learnt once for all, it might be
borne with: but as to the way of addressing letters, there ought
to be a professor's chair founded, from which lectures should be
given, so to speak, teaching us how to do it; for the paper
should on one occasion be left blank in one corner, and on
another in another corner; and a man must be addressed as the
illustrious who was not hitherto addressed as the magnificent.

18. I know not where this will stop: I am not yet fifty, and yet
I have seen so many changes during my life, that I do not know
how to live.  What will they do who are only just born, and who
may live many years?  Certainly I am sorry for those spiritual
people who, for certain holy purposes, are obliged to live in the
world; the cross they have to carry is a dreadful one.  If they
could all agree together, and make themselves ignorant, and be
willing to be considered so in these sciences, they would set
themselves free from much trouble.  But what folly am I about!
from speaking of the greatness of God I am come to speak of the
meanness of the world!  Since our Lord has given me the grace to
quit it, I wish to leave it altogether.   Let them settle these
matters who maintain these follies with so much labour.
God grant that in the next life, where there is no changing, we
may not have to pay for them!  Amen.

Chapter XXXVIII.


Certain Heavenly Secrets, Visions, and Revelations.  The Effects
of Them in Her Soul.


1. One night I was so unwell that I thought I might be excused
making my prayer; so I took my rosary, that I might employ myself
in vocal prayer, trying not to be recollected in my
understanding, though outwardly I was recollected, being in my
oratory.  These little precautions are of no use when our Lord
will have it otherwise.  I remained there but a few moments thus,
when I was rapt in spirit with such violence that I could make no
resistance whatever.  It seemed to me that I was taken up to
heaven; and the first persons I saw there were my father and my
mother.  I saw other things also; but the time was no longer than
that in which the Ave Maria might be said, and I was amazed at
it, looking on it all as too great a grace for me.  But as to the
shortness of the time, it might have been longer, only it was all
done in a very short space.

2. I was afraid it might be an illusion; but as I did not think
so, I knew not what to do, because I was very much ashamed to go
to my confessor about it.  It was not, as it seemed to me,
because I was humble, but because I thought he would laugh at me,
and say: Oh, what a St. Paul!--she sees the things of heaven; or
a St. Jerome.  And because these glorious Saints had had such
visions, I was so much the more afraid, and did nothing but cry;
for I did not think it possible for me to see what they saw.
At last, though I felt it exceedingly, I went to my confessor;
for I never dared to keep secret anything of this kind, however
much it distressed me to speak of them, owing to the great fear I
had of being deceived.  When my confessor saw how much I was
suffering, he consoled me greatly, and gave me plenty of good
reasons why I should have no fear.

3. It happened, also, as time went on, and it happens now from
time to time, that our Lord showed me still greater secrets.
The soul, even if it would, has neither the means not the power
to see more than what He shows it; and so, each time, I saw
nothing more than what our Lord was pleased to let me see.
But such was the vision, that the least part of it was enough to
make my soul amazed, and to raise it so high that it esteems and
counts as nothing all the things of this life.  I wish I could
describe, in some measure, the smallest portion of what I saw;
but when I think of doing it, I find it impossible; for the mere
difference alone between the light we have here below, and that
which is seen in a vision,--both being light,--is so great, that
there is no comparison between them; the brightness of the sun
itself seems to be something exceedingly loathsome.  In a word,
the imagination, however strong it may be, can neither conceive
nor picture to itself this light, nor any one of the things which
our Lord showed me in a joy so supreme that it cannot be
described; for then all the senses exult so deeply and so sweetly
that no description is possible; and so it is better to say
nothing more.

4. I was in this state once for more than an hour, our Lord
showing me wonderful things.  He seemed as if He would not leave
me.  He said to me, "See, My daughter, what they lose who are
against Me; do not fail to tell them of it."  Ah, my Lord, how
little good my words will do them, who are made blind by their
own conduct, if Thy Majesty will not give them light!  Some, to
whom Thou hast given it, there are, who have profited by the
knowledge of Thy greatness; but as they see it revealed to one so
wicked and base as I am, I look upon it as a great thing if there
should be any found to believe me.  Blessed be Thy name, and
blessed be Thy compassion; for I can trace, at least in my own
soul, a visible improvement.  Afterwards I wished I had continued
in that trance for ever, and that I had not returned to
consciousness, because of an abiding sense of contempt for
everything here below; all seemed to be filth; and I see how
meanly we employ ourselves who are detained on earth.

5. When I was staying with that lady of whom I have been
speaking, [1] it happened to me once when I was suffering from my
heart,--for, as I have said, [2] I suffered greatly at one time,
though not so much now,--that she, being a person of great
charity, brought out her jewels set in gold, and precious stones
of great price, and particularly a diamond, which she valued very
much.  She thought this might amuse me; but I laughed to myself,
and was very sorry to see what men made much of; for I thought of
what our Lord had laid up for us, and considered how impossible
it was for me, even if I made the effort, to have any
appreciation whatever of such things, provided our Lord did not
permit me to forget what He was keeping for us.

6. A soul in this state attains to a certain freedom, which is so
complete that none can understand it who does not possess it.
It is a real and true detachment, independent of our efforts; God
effects it all Himself; for His Majesty reveals the truth in such
a way, that it remains so deeply impressed on our souls as to
make it clear that we of ourselves could not thus acquire it in
so short a time.

7. The fear of death, also, was now very slight in me, who had
always been in great dread of it; now it seems to me that death
is a very light thing for one who serves God, because the soul is
in a moment delivered thereby out of its prison, and at rest.
This elevation of the spirit, and the vision of things so high,
in these trances seem to me to have a great likeness to the
flight of the soul from the body, in that it finds itself in a
moment in the possession of these good things.  We put aside the
agonies of its dissolution, of which no great account is to be
made; for they who love God in truth, and are utterly detached
from the things of this life, must die with the
greater sweetness.

8. It seems to me, also, that the rapture was a great help to
recognise our true home, and to see that we are pilgrims
here; [3] it is a great thing to see what is going on there and
to know where we have to live; for if a person has to go and
settle in another country, it is a great help to him, in
undergoing the fatigues of his journey, that he has discovered it
to be a country where he may live in the most perfect peace.
Moreover, it makes it easy for us to think of the things of
heaven, and to have our conversation there. [4]  It is a great
gain, because the mere looking up to heaven makes the soul
recollected; for as our Lord has been pleased to reveal heaven in
some degree, my soul dwells upon it in thought; and it happens
occasionally that they who are about me, and with whom I find
consolation, are those whom I know to be living in heaven, and
that I look upon them only as really alive; while those who are
on earth are so dead, that the whole world seems unable to
furnish me with companions, particularly when these impetuosities
of love are upon me. Everything seems a dream, and what I see
with the bodily eyes an illusion.  What I have seen with the eyes
of the soul is that which my soul desires; and as it finds itself
far away from those things, that is death.

9. In a word, it is a very great mercy which our Lord gives to
that soul to which He grants the like visions, for they help it
in much, and also in carrying a heavy cross, since nothing
satisfies it, and everything is against it; and if our Lord did
not now and then suffer these visions to be forgotten, though
they recur again and again to the memory, I know not how life
could be borne.  May He be blessed and praised for ever and ever!
I implore His Majesty by that Blood which His Son shed for me,
now that, of His good pleasure, I know something of these great
blessings, and begin to have the fruition of them, that it may
not be with me as it was with Lucifer, who by his own fault
forfeited it all.  I beseech Thee, for Thine own sake, not to
suffer this; for I am at times in great fear, though at others,
and most frequently, the mercy of God reassures me, for He who
has delivered me from so many sins will not withdraw His hand
from under me, and let me be lost.  I pray you, my father, to beg
this grace for me always.

10. The mercies, then, hitherto described, are not, in my
opinion, so great as those which I am now going to speak of, on
many accounts, because of the great blessings they have brought
with them, and because of the great fortitude which my soul
derived from them; and yet every one separately considered is so
great, that there is nothing to be compared with them.

11. One day--it was the eve of Pentecost--I went after Mass to a
very lonely spot, where I used to pray very often, and began to
read about the feast in the book of a Carthusian; [5] and reading
of the marks by which beginners, proficients, and the perfect may
know that they have the Holy Ghost, it seemed to me, when I had
read of these three states, that by the goodness of God, so far
as I could understand, the Holy Ghost was with me.  I praised God
for it; and calling to mind how on another occasion, when I read
this, I was very deficient,--for I saw most distinctly at that
time how deficient I was then from what I saw I was now,--I
recognised herein the great mercy of our Lord to me, and so began
to consider the place which my sins had earned for me in hell,
and praised God exceedingly, because it seemed as if I did not
know my own soul again, so great a change had come over it.

12. While thinking of these things, my soul was carried away with
extreme violence, and I knew not why.  It seemed as if it would
have gone forth out of the body, for it could not contain itself,
nor was it able to hope for so great a good.  The impetuosity was
so excessive that I had no power left, and, as I think, different
from what I had been used to.  I knew not what ailed my soul, nor
what it desired, for it was so changed.  I leaned for support,
for I could not sit, because my natural strength had
utterly failed.

13. Then I saw over my head a dove, very different from those we
usually see, for it had not the same plumage, but wings formed of
small shells shining brightly.  It was larger than an ordinary
dove; I thought I heard the rustling of its wings.  It hovered
above me during the space of an Ave Maria.  But such was the
state of my soul, that in losing itself it lost also the sight of
the dove.  My spirit grew calm with such a guest; and yet, as I
think, a grace so wonderful might have disturbed and frightened
it; and as it began to rejoice in the vision, it was delivered
from all fear, and with the joy came peace, my soul continuing
entranced.  The joy of this rapture was exceedingly great; and
for the rest of that festal time I was so amazed and bewildered
that I did not know what I was doing, nor how I could have
received so great a grace.  I neither heard nor saw anything, so
to speak, because of my great inward joy.  From that day forth I
perceived in myself a very great progress in the highest love of
God, together with a great increase in the strength of my
virtues.  May He be blessed and praised for ever!  Amen.

14. On another occasion I saw that very dove above the head of
one of the Dominican fathers; but it seemed to me that the rays
and brightness of the wings were far greater.  I understood by
this that he was to draw souls unto God.

15. At another time I saw our Lady putting a cope of exceeding
whiteness on that Licentiate of the same Order, of whom I have
made mention more than once. [6]  She told me that she gave him
that cope in consideration of the service he had rendered her by
helping to found this house, [7] that it was a sign that she
would preserve his soul pure for the future, and that he should
not fall into mortal sin.  I hold it for certain that so it came
to pass, for he died within a few years; his death and the rest
of his life were so penitential, his whole life and death so
holy, that, so far as anything can be known, there cannot be a
doubt on the subject.  One of the friars present at his death
told me that, before he breathed his last, he said to him that
St. Thomas was with him. [8]  He died in great joy, longing to
depart out of this land of exile.

16. Since then he has appeared to me more than once in
exceedingly great glory, and told me certain things.  He was so
given to prayer, that when he was dying, and would have
interrupted it if he could because of his great weakness, he was
not able to do so; for he was often in a trance.  He wrote to me
not long before he died, and asked me what he was to do; for as
soon as he had said Mass he fell into a trance which lasted a
long time, and which he could not hinder.  At last God gave him
the reward of the many services of his whole life.

17. I had certain visions, too, of the great graces which our
Lord bestowed upon that rector of the Society of Jesus, of whom I
have spoken already more than once; [9] but I will not say
anything of them now, lest I should be too tedious.  It was his
lot once to be in great trouble, to suffer great persecution and
distress.  One day, when I was hearing Mass, I saw Christ on the
Cross at the elevation of the Host.  He spoke certain words to
me, which I was to repeat to that father for his comfort,
together with others, which were to warn him beforehand of what
was coming, and to remind him of what He had suffered on his
behalf, and that he must prepare for suffering.  This gave him
great consolation and courage; and everything came to pass
afterwards as our Lord had told me.

18. I have seen great things of members of the Order to which
this father belongs, which is the Society of Jesus, and of the
whole Order itself; I have occasionally seen them in heaven with
white banners in their hands, and I have had other most wonderful
visions, as I am saying, about them, and therefore have a great
veneration for this Order; for I have had a great deal to do with
those who are of it, and I see that their lives are conformed to
that which our Lord gave me to understand about them.

19. One night, when I was in prayer, our Lord spoke to me certain
words, whereby He made me remember the great wickedness of my
past life.  They filled me with shame and distress; for though
they were not spoken with severity, they caused a feeling and a
painfulness which were too much for me: and we feel that we make
greater progress in the knowledge of ourselves when we hear one
of these words, than we can make by a meditation of many days on
our own misery, because these words impress the truth upon us at
the same time in such a way that we cannot resist it.  He set
before me the former inclinations of my will to vanities, and
told me to make much of the desire I now had that my will, which
had been so ill employed, should be fixed on Him, and that He
would accept it.

20. On other occasions He told me to remember how I used to think
it an honourable thing to go against His honour; and, again, to
remember my debt to Him, for when I was most rebellious He was
bestowing His graces upon me.  If I am doing anything wrong--and
my wrong-doings are many--His Majesty makes me see it in such a
way that I am utterly confounded; and as I do so often, that
happens often also.  I have been found fault with by my
confessors occasionally; and on betaking myself to prayer for
consolation, have received a real reprimand.

21. To return to what I was speaking of.  When our Lord made me
remember my wicked life, I wept; for as I considered that I had
then never done any good, I thought He might be about to bestow
upon me some special grace; because most frequently, when I
receive any particular mercy from our Lord, it is when I have
been previously greatly humiliated, in order that I may the more
clearly see how far I am from deserving it.  I think our Lord
must do it for that end.

22. Almost immediately after this I was so raised up in spirit
that I thought myself to be, as it were, out of the body; at
least, I did not know that I was living in it. [10]  I had a
vision of the most Sacred Humanity in exceeding glory, greater
than I had ever seen It in before.  I beheld It in a wonderful
and clear way in the bosom of the Father.  I cannot tell how it
was, for I saw myself, without seeing, as it seemed to me, in the
presence of God.  My amazement was such that I remained, as I
believe, some days before I could recover myself.  I had
continually before me, as present, the Majesty of the Son of God,
though not so distinctly as in the vision.  I understood this
well enough; but the vision remained so impressed on my
imagination, that I could not get rid of it for some time, though
it had lasted but a moment; it is a great comfort to me, and also
a great blessing.

23. I have had this vision on three other occasions, and it is, I
think, the highest vision of all the visions which our Lord in
His mercy showed me.  The fruits of it are the very greatest, for
it seems to purify the soul in a wonderful way, and destroy, as
it were utterly, altogether the strength of our sensual nature.
It is a grand flame of fire, which seems to burn up and
annihilate all the desires of this life.  For though now--glory
be to God!--I had no desire after vanities, I saw clearly in the
vision how all things are vanity, and how hollow are all the
dignities of earth; it was a great lesson, teaching me to raise
up my desires to the Truth alone.  It impresses on the soul a
sense of the presence of God such as I cannot in any way
describe, only it is very different from that which it is in our
own power to acquire on earth.  It fills the soul with profound
astonishment at its own daring, and at any one else being able to
dare to offend His most awful Majesty.

24. I must have spoken now and then of the effects of
visions, [11] and of other matters of the same kind, and I have
already said that the blessings they bring with them are of
various degrees; but those of this vision are the highest of all.
When I went to Communion once I called to mind the exceeding
great majesty of Him I had seen, and considered that it was He
who is present in the most Holy Sacrament, and very often our
Lord was pleased to show Himself to me in the Host; the very
hairs on my head stood, [12] and I thought I should come
to nothing.

25. O my Lord! ah, if Thou didst not throw a veil over Thy
greatness, who would dare, being so foul and miserable, to come
in contact with Thy great Majesty?  Blessed be Thou, O Lord; may
the angels and all creation praise Thee, who orderest all things
according to the measure of our weakness, so that, when we have
the fruition of Thy sovereign mercies, Thy great power may not
terrify us, so that we dare not, being a frail and miserable
race, persevere in that fruition!

26. It might happen to us as it did to the labourer--I know it to
be a certain fact--who found a treasure beyond his expectations,
which were mean.  When he saw himself in possession of it, he was
seized with melancholy, which by degrees brought him to his grave
through simple distress and anxiety of mind, because he did not
know what to do with his treasure.  If he had not found it all at
once, and if others had given him portions of it by degrees,
maintaining him thereby, he might have been more happy than he
had been in his poverty, nor would it have cost him his life.

27. O Thou Treasure of the poor! how marvellously Thou sustainest
souls, showing to them, not all at once, but by little and
little, the abundance of Thy riches!  When I behold Thy great
Majesty hidden beneath that which is so slight as the Host is, I
am filled with wonder, ever since that vision, at Thy great
wisdom; and I know not how it is that our Lord gives me the
strength and courage necessary to draw near to him, were it not
that He who has had such compassion on me, and still has, gives
me strength, nor would it be possible for me to be silent, or
refrain from making known marvels so great.

28. What must be the thoughts of a wretched person such as I am,
full of abominations, and who has spent her life with so little
fear of God, when she draws near to our Lord's great Majesty, at
the moment He is pleased to show Himself to my soul?  How can I
open my mouth, that has uttered so many words against Him, to
receive that most glorious Body, purity and compassion itself?
The love that is visible in His most beautiful Face, sweet and
tender, pains and distresses the soul, because it has not served
Him, more than all the terrors of His Majesty.  What should have
been my thoughts, then, on those two occasions when I saw what I
have described?  Truly, O my Lord and my joy, I am going to say
that in some way, in these great afflictions of my soul, I have
done something in Thy service.  Ah!  I know not what I am saying,
for I am writing this as if the words were not mine, [13] because
I am troubled, and in some measure beside myself, when I call
these things to remembrance.  If these thoughts were really mine,
I might well say that I had done something for Thee, O my Lord;
but as I can have no good thought if Thou givest it not, no
thanks are due to me; I am the debtor, O Lord, and it is Thou who
art the offended One.

29. Once, when I was going to Communion, I saw with the eyes of
the soul, more distinctly than with those of the body, two devils
of most hideous shape; their horns seemed to encompass the throat
of the poor priest; and I beheld my Lord, in that great majesty
of which I have spoken, [14] held in the hands of that priest, in
the Host he was about to give me.  It was plain that those hands
were those of a sinner, and I felt that the soul of that priest
was in mortal sin.  What must it be, O my Lord, to look upon Thy
beauty amid shapes so hideous!  The two devils were so frightened
and cowed in Thy presence, that they seemed as if they would have
willingly run away, hadst Thou but given them leave.  So troubled
was I by the vision, that I knew not how I could go to Communion.
I was also in great fear, for I thought, if the vision was from
God, that His Majesty would not have allowed me to see the evil
state of that soul. [15]

30. Our Lord Himself told me to pray for that priest; that He had
allowed this in order that I might understand the power of the
words of consecration, and how God failed not to be present,
however wicked the priest might be who uttered them; and that I
might see His great goodness in that He left Himself in the very
hands of His enemy, for my good and for the good of all.
I understood clearly how the priests are under greater
obligations to be holy than other persons; and what a horrible
thing it is to receive this most Holy Sacrament unworthily, and
how great is the devil's dominion over a soul in mortal sin.
It did me a great service, and made me fully understand what I
owe to God.  May He be blessed for evermore!

31. At another time I had a vision of a different kind, which
frightened me very much.  I was in a place where a certain person
died, who as I understood had led a very bad life, and that for
many years.  But he had been ill for two years, and in some
respects seemed to have reformed.  He died without confession;
nevertheless, I did not think he would be damned.  When the body
had been wrapped in the winding-sheet, I saw it laid hold of by a
multitude of devils, who seemed to toss it to and fro, and also
to treat it with great cruelty.  I was terrified at the sight,
for they dragged it about with great hooks.  But when I saw it
carried to the grave with all the respect and ceremoniousness
common to all, I began to think of the goodness of God, who would
not allow that person to be dishonoured, but would have the fact
of his being His enemy concealed.

32. I was almost out of my senses at the sight.  During the whole
of the funeral service, I did not see one of the evil spirits.
Afterwards, when the body was about to be laid in the grave, so
great a multitude of them was therein waiting to receive it, that
I was beside myself at the sight, and it required no slight
courage on my part not to betray my distress. I thought of the
treatment which that soul would receive, when the devils had such
power over the wretched body.  Would to God that all who live in
mortal sin might see what I then saw,--it was a fearful sight; it
would go, I believe, a great way towards making them lead
better lives.

33. All this made me know more of what I owe to God, and of the
evils from which He has delivered me.  I was in great terror.
I spoke of it to my confessor, and I thought it might be an
illusion of Satan, in order to take away my good opinion of that
person, who yet was not accounted a very good Christian.
The truth is, that, whether it was an illusion or not, it makes
me afraid whenever I think of it.

34. Now that I have begun to speak of the visions I had
concerning the dead, I will mention some matters which our Lord
was pleased to reveal to me in relation to certain souls.  I will
confine myself to a few for the sake of brevity, and because they
are not necessary; I mean that they are not for our profit.
They told me that one who had been our Provincial--he was then of
another province--was dead.  He was a man of great virtue, with
whom I had had a great deal to do, and to whom I was under many
obligations for certain kindnesses shown me.  When I heard that
he was dead, I was exceedingly troubled, because I trembled for
his salvation, seeing that he had been superior for twenty years.
That is what I dread very much; for the cure of souls seems to me
to be full of danger.  I went to an oratory in great distress,
and gave up to him all the good I had ever done in my whole
life,--it was little enough,--and prayed our Lord that His merits
might fill up what was wanting, in order that this soul might be
delivered up from purgatory.

35. While I was thus praying to our Lord as well as I could, he
seemed to me to rise up from the depths of the earth on my right
hand, and I saw him ascend to heaven in exceeding great joy.
He was a very old man then, but I saw him as if he were only
thirty years old, and I thought even younger, and there was a
brightness in his face.  This vision passed away very quickly;
but I was so exceedingly comforted by it, that I could never
again mourn his death, although many persons were distressed at
it, for he was very much beloved.  So greatly comforted was my
soul, that nothing disturbed it, neither could I doubt the truth
of the vision; I mean that it was no illusion.

36. I had this vision about a fortnight after he was dead;
nevertheless, I did not omit to obtain prayers for him and I
prayed myself, only I could not pray with the same earnestness
that I should have done if I had not seen that vision.  For when
our Lord showed him thus to me, it seemed to me afterwards, when
I prayed for him to His Majesty,--and I could not help it,--that
I was like one who gave alms to a rich man.  Later on I heard an
account of the death he died in our Lord--he was far away from
here; it was one of such great edification, that he left all
wondering to see how recollected, how penitent, and how humble he
was when he died.

37. A nun, who was a great servant of God, died in this house.
On the next day one of the sisters was reciting the lesson in the
Office of the Dead, which was said in choir for that nun's soul,
and I was standing myself to assist her in singing the versicle,
when, in the middle of the lesson, I saw the departed nun as I
believe, in a vision; her soul seemed to rise on my right hand
like the soul of the Provincial, and ascend to heaven.
This vision was not imaginary, like the preceding, but like those
others of which I have spoken before; [16] it is not less
certain, however, than the other visions I had.

38. Another nun died in this same house of mine, she was about
eighteen or twenty years of age, and had always been sickly.
She was a great servant of God, attentive in choir, and a person
of great virtue.  I certainly thought that she would not go to
purgatory, on account of her exceeding merits, because the
infirmities under which she had laboured were many.  While I was
saying the Office, before she was buried,--she had been dead
about four hours,--I saw her rise in the same place and ascend
to heaven.

39. I was once in one of the colleges of the Society of Jesus,
and in one of those great sufferings which, as I have said, [17]
I occasionally had, and still have, both in soul and body, and
then so grievously that I was not able, as it seemed to me, to
have even one good thought.  The night before, one of the
brothers of that house had died in it; and I, as well as I could,
was commending his soul to God, and hearing the Mass which
another father of that Society was saying for him when I became
recollected at once, and saw him go up to heaven in great glory,
and our Lord with him.  I understood that His Majesty went with
him by way of special grace.

40. Another brother of our Order, a good friar, was very ill; and
when I was at Mass, I became recollected and saw him dead,
entering into heaven without going through purgatory.  He died,
as I afterwards learned, at the very time of my vision.  I was
amazed that he had not gone to purgatory.  I understood that,
having become a friar and carefully kept the rule, the Bulls of
the Order had been of use to him, so that he did not pass into
purgatory.  I do not know why I came to have this revealed to me;
I think it must be because I was to learn that it is not enough
for a man to be a friar in his habit--I mean, to wear the
habit--to attain to that state of high perfection which that of a
friar is.

41. I will speak no more of these things, because as I have just
said, [18] there is no necessity for it, though our Lord has been
so gracious to me as to show me much.  But in all the visions I
had, I saw no souls escape purgatory except this Carmelite
father, the holy friar Peter of Alcantara, and that Dominican
father of whom I spoke before. [19]  It pleased our Lord to let
me see the degree of glory to which some souls have been raised,
showing them to me in the places they occupy.  There is a great
difference between one place and another.

Chapter XXXIX.


Other Graces Bestowed on the Saint.  The Promises of Our Lord
to Her.  Divine Locutions and Visions.


1. I was once importuning our Lord exceedingly to restore the
sight of a person who had claims upon me, and who was almost
wholly blind.  I was very sorry for him, and afraid our Lord
would not hear me because of my sins.  He appeared to me as at
other times, and began to show the wound in His left hand; with
the other He drew out the great nail that was in it, and it
seemed to me that, in drawing the nail, He tore the flesh.
The greatness of the pain was manifest, and I was very much
distressed thereat.  He said to me, that He who had borne that
for my sake would still more readily grant what I asked Him, and
that I was not to have any doubts about it.  He promised me there
was nothing I should ask that He would not grant; that He knew I
should ask nothing that was not for His glory, and that He would
grant me what I was now praying for.  Even during the time when I
did not serve Him, I should find, if I considered it, I had asked
nothing that He had not granted in an ampler manner than I had
known how to ask; how much more amply still would He grant what I
asked for, now that He knew I loved Him!  I was not to doubt.
I do not think that eight days passed before our Lord restored
that person to sight.  My confessor knew it forthwith.  It might
be that it was not owing to my prayer; but, as I had had the
vision, I have a certain conviction that it was a grace accorded
to me.  I gave thanks to His Majesty.

2. Again, a person was exceedingly ill of a most painful disease;
but, as I do not know what it was, I do not describe it by its
name here.  What he had gone through for two months was beyond
all endurance; and his pain was so great that he tore his own
flesh.  My confessor, the rector of whom I have spoken, [1] went
to see him; he was very sorry for him, and told me that I must
anyhow go myself and visit him; he was one whom I might visit,
for he was my kinsman.  I went, and was moved to such a tender
compassion for him that I began, with the utmost importunity, to
ask our Lord to restore him to health.  Herein I saw clearly how
gracious our Lord was to me, so far as I could judge; for
immediately, the next day, he was completely rid of that pain.

3. I was once in the deepest distress, because I knew that a
person to whom I was under great obligations was about to commit
an act highly offensive to God and dishonourable to himself.
He was determined upon it.  I was so much harassed by this that I
did not know what to do in order to change his purpose; and it
seemed to me as if nothing could be done.  I implored God, from
the bottom of my heart, to find a way to hinder it; but till I
found it I could find no relief for the pain I felt.  In my
distress, I went to a very lonely hermitage,--one of those
belonging to this monastery,--in which there is a picture of
Christ bound to the pillar; and there, as I was imploring our
Lord to grant me this grace, I heard a voice of exceeding
gentleness, speaking, as it were, in a whisper. [2]  My whole
body trembled, for it made me afraid.  I wished to understand
what was said, but I could not, for it all passed away in
a moment.

4. When my fears had subsided, and that was immediately, I became
conscious of an inward calmness, a joy and delight, which made me
marvel how the mere hearing a voice,--I heard it with my bodily
ears,--without understanding a word, could have such an effect on
the soul.  I saw by this that my prayer was granted; and so it
was; and I was freed from my anxieties about a matter not yet
accomplished, as it afterwards was, as completely as if I saw it
done.  I told my confessors of it, for I had two at this time,
both of them learned men, and great servants of God.

5. I knew of a person who had resolved to serve God in all
earnestness, and had for some days given himself to prayer, in
which he bad received many graces from our Lord, but who had
abandoned his good resolutions because of certain occasions of
sin in which he was involved, and which he would not avoid; they
were extremely perilous.  This caused me the utmost distress,
because the person was one for whom I had a great affection, and
one to whom I owed much.  For more than a month I believe I did
nothing else but pray to God for his conversion.  One day, when I
was in prayer, I saw a devil close by in a great rage, tearing to
pieces some paper which he had in his hands.  That sight consoled
me greatly, because it seemed that my prayer had been heard.
So it was, as I learnt afterwards; for that person had made his
confession with great contrition, and returned to God so
sincerely, that I trust in His Majesty he will always advance
further and further.  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.

6. In answer to my prayers, our Lord has very often rescued souls
from mortal sins and led others on to greater perfection. But as
to the delivering of souls out of purgatory, and other remarkable
acts, so many are the mercies of our Lord herein, that were I to
speak of them I should only weary myself and my reader. But He
has done more by me for the salvation of souls than for the
health of the body.  This is very well known, and there are many
to bear witness to it.

7. At first it made me scrupulous, because I could not help
thinking that our Lord did these things in answer to my prayer; I
say nothing of the chief reason of all--His pure compassion.  But
now these graces are so many, and so well known to others, that
it gives me no pain to think so.  I bless His Majesty, and abase
myself, because I am still more deeply in His debt; and I believe
that He makes my desire to serve Him grow, and my love revive.

8. But what amazes me most is this: however much I may wish to
pray for those graces which our Lord sees not to be expedient, I
cannot do it; and if I try, I do so with little earnestness,
force, and spirit: it is impossible to do more, even if I would.
But it is not so as to those which His Majesty intends to grant.
These I can pray for constantly, and with great importunity;
though I do not carry them in my memory, they seem to present
themselves to me at once. [3]

9. There is a great difference between these two ways of praying,
and I know not how to explain it.  As to the first, when I pray
for those graces which our Lord does not mean to grant,--even
though they concern me very nearly,--I am like one whose tongue
is tied; who, though he would speak, yet cannot; or, if he
speaks, sees that people do not listen to him.  And yet I do not
fail to force myself to pray, though not conscious of that
fervour which I have when praying for those graces which our Lord
intends to give.  In the second case, I am like one who speaks
clearly and intelligibly to another, whom he sees to be a
willing listener.

10. The prayer that is not to be heard is, so to speak, like
vocal prayer; the other is a prayer of contemplation so high that
our Lord shows Himself in such a way as to make us feel He hears
us, and that He delights in our prayer, and that He is about to
grant our petition.  Blessed be He for ever who gives me so much
and to whom I give so little!  For what is he worth, O my Lord,
who does not utterly abase himself to nothing for Thee?  How
much, how much, how much,--I might say so a thousand times,--I
fall short of this!  It is on this account that I do not wish to
live,--though there be other reasons also,--because I do not live
according to the obligations which bind me to Thee.
What imperfections I trace in myself! what remissness in Thy
service! Certainly, I could wish occasionally I had no sense,
that I might be unconscious of the great evil that is in me.
May He who can do all things help me!

11. When I was staying in the house of that lady of whom I have
spoken before, [4] it was necessary for me to be very watchful
over myself, and keep continually in mind the intrinsic vanity of
all the things of this life, because of the great esteem I was
held in, and of the praises bestowed on me.  There was much there
to which I might have become attached, if I had looked only to
myself; but I looked to Him who sees things as they really are,
not to let me go out of His hand.  Now that I speak of seeing
things as they really are, I remember how great a trial it is for
those to whom God has granted a true insight into the things of
earth to have to discuss them with others.  They wear so many
disguises, as our Lord once told me,--and much of what I am
saying of them is not from myself, but rather what my Heavenly
Master has taught me; and therefore, in speaking of them, when I
say distinctly I understood this, or our Lord told me this, I am
very scrupulous neither to add nor to take away one single
syllable; so, when I do not clearly remember everything exactly,
that must be taken as coming from myself, and some things,
perhaps, are so altogether.  I do not call mine that which is
good, for I know there is no other good in me but only that which
our Lord gave me when I was so far from deserving it: I call that
mine which I speak without having had it made known to me
by revelation.

12. But, O my God, how is it that we too often judge even
spiritual things, as we do those of the world, by our own
understanding, wresting them grievously from their true meaning?
We think we may measure our progress by the years which we have
given to the exercise of prayer; we even think we can prescribe
limits to Him who bestows His gifts not by measure [5] when He
wills, and who in six months can give to one more than to another
in many years.  This is a fact which I have so frequently
observed in many persons, that I am surprised how any of us can
deny it.

13. I am certainly convinced that he will not remain under this
delusion who possesses the gift of discerning spirits, and to
whom our Lord has given real humility; for such a one will judge
of them by the fruits, by the good resolutions and love,--and our
Lord gives him light to understand the matter; and herein He
regards the progress and advancement of souls, not the years they
may have spent in prayer; for one person may make greater
progress in six months than another in twenty years, because, as
I said before, our Lord gives to whom He will, particularly to
him who is best disposed.

14. I see this in certain persons of tender years who have come
to this monastery,--God touches their hearts, and gives them a
little light and love.  I speak of that brief interval in which
He gives them sweetness in prayer, and then they wait for nothing
further, and make light of every difficulty, forgetting the
necessity even of food; for they shut themselves up for ever in a
house that is unendowed, as persons who make no account of their
life, for His sake, who, they know, loves them.  They give up
everything, even their own will; and it never enters into their
mind that they might be discontented in so small a house, and
where enclosure is so strictly observed.  They offer themselves
wholly in sacrifice to God.

15. Oh, how willingly do I admit that they are better than I am!
and how I ought to be ashamed of myself before God!  What His
Majesty has not been able to accomplish in me in so many
years,--it is long ago since I began to pray, and He to bestow
His graces upon me,--He accomplished in them in three months, and
in some of them even in three days, though he gives them much
fewer graces than He gave to me: and yet His Majesty rewards them
well; most assuredly they are not sorry for what they have done
for Him.

16. I wish, therefore, we reminded ourselves of those long years
which have gone by since we made our religious profession.  I say
this to those persons, also, who have given themselves long ago
to prayer, but not for the purpose of distressing those who in a
short time have made greater progress than we have made, by
making them retrace their steps, so that they may proceed only as
we do ourselves.  We must not desire those who, because of the
graces God has given them, are flying like eagles, to become like
chickens whose feet are tied.  Let us rather look to His Majesty,
and give these souls the reins, if we see that they are humble;
for our Lord, who has had such compassion upon them, will not let
them fall into the abyss.

17. These souls trust themselves in the hands of God, for the
truth, which they learn by faith, helps them to do it; and shall
not we also trust them to Him, without seeking to measure them by
our measure which is that of our meanness of spirit?  We must not
do it; for if we cannot ascend to the heights of their great love
and courage,--without experience none can comprehend them--let us
humble ourselves, and not condemn them; for, by this seeming
regard to their progress, we hinder our own, and miss the
opportunity our Lord gives us to humble ourselves, to ascertain
our own shortcomings, and learn how much more detached and more
near to God these souls must be than we are, seeing that His
Majesty draws so near to them Himself.

18. I have no other intention here, and I wish to have no other,
than to express my preference for the prayer that in a short time
results in these great effects, which show themselves at once;
for it is impossible they should enable us to leave all things
only to please God, if they were not accompanied with a vehement
love.  I would rather have that prayer than that which lasted
many years, but which at the end of the time, as well as at the
beginning, never issued in a resolution to do anything for God,
with the exception of some trifling services, like a grain of
salt, without weight or bulk, and which a bird might carry away
in its mouth.  Is it not a serious and mortifying thought that we
are making much of certain services which we render our Lord, but
which are too pitiable to be considered, even if they were many
in number?  This is my case, and I am forgetting every moment the
mercies of our Lord.  I do not mean that His Majesty will not
make much of them Himself, for He is good; but I wish I made no
account of them myself, or even perceived that I did them, for
they are nothing worth.

19. But, O my Lord, do Thou forgive me, and blame me not, if I
try to console myself a little with the little I do, seeing that
I do not serve Thee at all; for if I rendered Thee any great
services, I should not think of these trifles.  Blessed are they
who serve Thee in great deeds; if envying these, and desiring to
do what they do, were of any help to me, I should not be so far
behind them as I am in pleasing Thee; but I am nothing worth, O
my Lord; do Thou make me of some worth, Thou who lovest me
so much.

20. During one of those days, when this monastery, which seems to
have cost me some labour, was fully founded by the arrival of the
Brief from Rome, which empowered us to live without an
endowment; [6] and I was comforting myself at seeing the whole
affair concluded, and thinking of all the trouble I had had, and
giving thanks to our Lord for having been pleased to make some
use of me,--it happened that I began to consider all that we had
gone through.  Well, so it was; in every one of my actions, which
I thought were of some service, I traced so many faults and
imperfections, now and then but little courage, very frequently a
want of faith; for until this moment, when I see everything
accomplished, I never absolutely believed; neither, however, on
the other hand, could I doubt what our Lord said to me about the
foundation of this house.  I cannot tell how it was; very often
the matter seemed to me, on the one hand, impossible; and, on the
other hand, I could not be in doubt; I mean, I could not believe
that it would not be accomplished.  In short, I find that our
Lord Himself, on His part, did all the good that was done, while
I did all the evil.  I therefore ceased to think of the matter,
and wished never to be reminded of it again, lest I should do
myself some harm by dwelling on my many faults. Blessed be He
who, when He pleases, draws good out of all my failings!  Amen.

21. I say, then, there is danger in counting the years we have
given to prayer; for, granting that there is nothing in it
against humility, it seems to me to imply something like an
appearance of thinking that we have merited, in some degree, by
the service rendered.  I do not mean that there is no merit in it
at all, nor that it will not be well rewarded; yet if any
spiritual person thinks, because he has given himself to prayer
for many years, that he deserves any spiritual consolations, I am
sure he will never attain to spiritual perfection.  Is it not
enough that a man has merited the protection of God, which keeps
him from committing those sins into which he fell before he began
to pray, but he must also, as they say, sue God for His
own money?

22. This does not seem to me to be deep humility, and yet it may
be that it is; however, I look on it as great boldness, for I,
who have very little humility, have never ventured upon it.
It may be that I never asked for it, because I had never served
Him; perhaps, if I had served Him, I should have been more
importunate than all others with our Lord for my reward.

23. I do not mean that the soul makes no progress in time, or
that God will not reward it, if its prayer has been humble; but I
do mean that we should forget the number of years we have been
praying, because all that we can do is utterly worthless in
comparison with one drop of blood out of those which our Lord
shed for us.  And if the more we serve Him, the more we become
His debtors, what is it, then, we are asking for? for, if we pay
one farthing of the debt, He gives us back a thousand ducats.
For the love of God, let us leave these questions alone, for they
belong to Him.  Comparisons are always bad, even in earthly
things; what, then, must they be in that, the knowledge of which
God has reserved to Himself? His Majesty showed this clearly
enough, when those who came late and those who came early to His
vineyard received the same wages. [7]

24. I have sat down so often to write, and have been so many days
writing these three leaves,--for, as I have said, [8] I had, and
have still, but few opportunities,--that I forgot what I had
begun with, namely, the following vision. [9]

25. I was in prayer, and saw myself on a wide plain all alone.
Round about me stood a great multitude of all kinds of people,
who hemmed me in on every side; all of them seemed to have
weapons of war in their hands, to hurt me; some had spears,
others swords; some had daggers, and others very long rapiers.
In short, I could not move away in any direction without exposing
myself to the hazard of death, and I was alone, without any one
to take my part.  In this my distress of mind, not knowing what
to do, I lifted up my eyes to heaven, and saw Christ, not in
heaven, but high above me in the air, holding out His hand to me,
and there protecting me in such a way that I was no longer afraid
of all that multitude, neither could they, though they wished it,
do me any harm.

26. At first the vision seemed to have no results; but it has
been of the greatest help to me, since I understood what it
meant.  Not long afterwards, I saw myself, as it were, exposed to
the like assault, and I saw that the vision represented the
world, because everything in it takes up arms against the poor
soul.  We need not speak of those who are not great servants of
our Lord, nor of honours, possessions, and pleasures, with other
things of the same nature; for it is clear that the soul, if it
be not watchful, will find itself caught in a net,--at least, all
these things labour to ensnare it; more than this, so also do
friends and relatives, and--what frightens me most--even good
people.  I found myself afterwards so beset on all sides, good
people thinking they were doing good, and I knowing not how to
defend myself, nor what to do.

27. O my God, if I were to say in what way, and in how many ways,
I was tried at that time, even after that trial of which I have
just spoken, what a warning I should be giving to men to hate the
whole world utterly!  It was the greatest of all the persecutions
I had to undergo.  I saw myself occasionally so hemmed in on
every side, that I could do nothing else but lift up my eyes to
heaven, and cry unto God. [10] I recollected well what I had seen
in the vision, and it helped me greatly not to trust much in any
one, for there is no one that can be relied on except God.
In all my great trials, our Lord--He showed it to me--sent always
some one on His part to hold out his hand to help me, as it was
shown to me in the vision, so that I might attach myself to
nothing, but only please our Lord; and this has been enough to
sustain the little virtue I have in desiring to serve Thee: be
Thou blessed for evermore!

28. On one occasion I was exceedingly disquieted and troubled,
unable to recollect myself, fighting and struggling with my
thoughts, running upon matters which did not relate to
perfection; and, moreover, I did not think I was so detached from
all things as I used to be.  When I found myself in this wretched
state, I was afraid that the graces I had received from our Lord
were illusions, and the end was that a great darkness covered my
soul.  In this my distress our Lord began to speak to me: He bade
me not to harass myself, but learn, from the consideration of my
misery, what it would be if He withdrew Himself from me, and that
we were never safe while living in the flesh.  It was given me to
understand how this fighting and struggling are profitable to us,
because of the reward, and it seemed to me as if our Lord were
sorry for us who live in the world.  Moreover, He bade me not to
suppose that He had forgotten me; He would never abandon me, but
it was necessary I should do all that I could myself.

29. Our Lord said all this with great tenderness and sweetness;
He also spoke other most gracious words, which I need not repeat.
His Majesty, further showing His great love for me, said to me
very often: "Thou art Mine, and I am thine."  I am in the habit
of saying myself, and I believe in all sincerity: "What do I care
for myself?--I care only for Thee, O my Lord."

30. These words of our Lord, and the consolation He gives me,
fill me with the utmost shame, when I remember what I am.  I have
said it before, I think, [11] and I still say now and then to my
confessor, that it requires greater courage to receive these
graces than to endure the heaviest trials.  When they come, I
forget, as it were, all I have done, and there is nothing before
me but a picture of my wretchedness, and my understanding can
make no reflections; this, also, seems to me at times to
be supernatural.

31. Sometimes I have such a vehement longing for Communion; I do
not think it can be expressed.  One morning it happened to rain
so much as to make it seem impossible to leave the house.  When I
had gone out, I was so beside myself with that longing, that if
spears had been pointed at my heart, I should have rushed upon
them; the rain was nothing.  When I entered the church I fell
into a deep trance, and saw heaven open--not a door only, as I
used to see at other times.  I beheld the throne which, as I have
told you, my father, I saw at other times, with another throne
above it, whereon, though I saw not, I understood by a certain
inexplicable knowledge that the Godhead dwelt.

32. The throne seemed to me to be supported by certain animals; I
believe I saw the form of them: I thought they might be the
Evangelists.  But how the throne was arrayed, and Him who sat on
it I did not see, but only an exceedingly great multitude of
angels, who seemed to me more beautiful, beyond all comparison,
than those I had seen in heaven.  I thought they were, perhaps,
the seraphim or cherubim, for they were very different in their
glory, and seemingly all on fire.  The difference is great, as I
said before; [12] and the joy I then felt cannot be described,
either in writing or by word of mouth; it is inconceivable to any
one what has not had experience of it. I felt that everything man
can desire was all there together, and I saw nothing; they told
me, but I know not who, that all I could do there was to
understand that I could understand nothing, and see how
everything was nothing in comparison with that.  So it was; my
soul afterwards was vexed to see that it could rest on any
created thing: how much more, then, if it had any affection
thereto; for everything seemed to me but an ant-hill.
I communicated, and remained during Mass.  I know not how it was:
I thought I had been but a few minutes, and was amazed when the
clock struck; I had been two hours in that trance and joy.

33. I was afterwards amazed at this fire, which seems to spring
forth out of the true love of God; for though I might long for
it, labour for it, and annihilate myself in the effort to obtain
it, I can do nothing towards procuring a single spark of it
myself, because it all comes of the good pleasure of His Majesty,
as I said on another occasion. [13]  It seems to burn up the old
man, with his faults, his lukewarmness, and misery; so that it is
like the phoenix, of which I have read that it comes forth, after
being burnt, out of its own ashes into a new life.  Thus it is
with the soul: it is changed into another, whose desires are
different, and whose strength is great.  It seems to be no longer
what it was before, and begins to walk renewed in purity in the
ways of our Lord.  When I was praying to Him that thus it might
be with me, and that I might begin His service anew, He said to
me: "The comparison thou hast made is good; take care never to
forget it, that thou mayest always labour to advance."

34. Once, when I was doubting, as I said just now, [14] whether
these visions came from God or not, our Lord appeared, and, with
some severity, said to me: "O children of men, how long will you
remain hard of heart!"  I was to examine myself carefully on one
subject,--whether I had given myself up wholly to Him, or not.
If I had,--and it was so,--I was to believe that He would not
suffer me to perish.  I was very much afflicted when He spoke
thus, but He turned to me with great tenderness and sweetness,
and bade me not to distress myself, for He knew already that, so
far as it lay in my power, I would not fail in anything that was
for His service; that He Himself would do what I wished,--and so
He did grant what I was then praying for; that I was to consider
my love for Him, which was daily growing in me, for I should see
by this that these visions did not come from Satan; that I must
not imagine that God would ever allow the devil to have so much
power over the souls of His servants as to give them such
clearness of understanding and such peace as I had.

35. He gave me also to understand that, when such and so many
persons had told me the visions were from God, I should do wrong
if I did not believe them. [15]

36. Once, when I was reciting the psalm Quicumque vult, [16] I
was given to understand the mystery of One God and Three Persons
with so much clearness, that I was greatly astonished and
consoled at the same time.  This was of the greatest help to me,
for it enabled me to know more of the greatness and marvels of
God; and when I think of the most Holy Trinity, or hear It spoken
of, I seem to understand the mystery, and a great joy it is.

37. One day--it was the Feast of the Assumption of the Queen of
the Angels, and our Lady--our Lord was pleased to grant me this
grace.  In a trance He made me behold her going up to heaven, the
joy and solemnity of her reception there, as well as the place
where she now is.  To describe it is more than I can do; the joy
that filled my soul at the sight of such great glory was
excessive.  The effects of the vision were great; it made me long
to endure still greater trials: and I had a vehement desire to
serve our Lady, because of her great merits.

38. Once, in one of the colleges of the Society of Jesus, when
the brothers of the house were communicating, I saw an
exceedingly rich canopy above their heads.  I saw this twice; but
I never saw it when others were receiving Communion.

Visions, Revelations, and Locutions.


1. One day, in prayer, the sweetness of which was so great that,
knowing how unworthy I was of so great a blessing, I began to
think how much I had deserved to be in that place which I had
seen prepared for me in hell,--for, as I said before, [1] I never
forget the way I saw myself there,--as I was thinking of this, my
soul began to be more and more on fire, and I was carried away in
spirit in a way I cannot describe.  It seemed to me as if I had
been absorbed in, and filled with, that grandeur of God which, on
another occasion, I had felt. [2]  In that majesty it was given
me to understand one truth, which is the fulness of all truth,
but I cannot tell how, for I saw nothing.  It was said to me, I
saw not by whom, but I knew well enough it was the Truth Itself:
"This I am doing to thee is not a slight matter; it is one of
those things for which thou owest Me much; for all the evil in
the world comes from ignorance of the truths of the holy writings
in their clear simplicity, of which not one iota shall pass
away." [3]  I thought that I had always believed this, and that
all the faithful also believed it.  Then he said,: "Ah, My
daughter, they are few who love Me in truth; for if men loved Me,
I should not hide My secrets from them.  Knowest thou what it is
to love Me in truth?  It is to admit everything to be a lie which
is not pleasing unto Me.  Now thou dost not understand it, but
thou shalt understand it clearly hereafter, in the profit it will
be to thy soul."

2. Our Lord be praised, so I found it; for after this vision I
look upon everything which does not tend to the service of God as
vanity and lies.  I cannot tell how much I am convinced of this,
nor how sorry I am for those whom I see living in darkness, not
knowing the truth.  I derived other great blessings also from
this, some of which I will here speak of, others I cannot
describe.

3. Our Lord at the same time uttered a special word of most
exceeding graciousness.  I know not how it was done, for I saw
nothing; but I was filled, in a way which also I cannot describe,
with exceeding strength and earnestness of purpose to observe
with all my might everything contained in the divine writings.
I thought that I could rise above every possible hindrance put in
my way.

4. Of this divine truth, which was put before me I know not how,
there remains imprinted within me a truth--I cannot give it a
name--which fills me with a new reverence for God; it gives me a
notion of His Majesty and power in a way which I cannot explain.
I can understand that it is something very high.  I had a very
great desire never to speak of anything but of those deep truths
which far surpass all that is spoken of here in the world,--and
so the living in it began to be painful to me.

5. The vision left me in great tenderness, joy, and humility.
It seemed to me, though I knew not how, that our Lord now gave me
great things; and I had no suspicion whatever of any illusion.
I saw nothing; but I understood how great a blessing it is to
make no account of anything which does not lead us nearer unto
God.  I also understood what it is for a soul to be walking in
the truth, in the presence of the Truth itself.  What I
understood is this: that our Lord gave me to understand that He
is Himself the very Truth.

6. All this I am speaking of I learnt at times by means of words
uttered; at other times I learnt some things without the help of
words, and that more clearly than those other things which were
told me in words.  I understood exceedingly deep truths
concerning the Truth, more than I could have done through the
teaching of many learned men.  It seems to me that learned men
never could have thus impressed upon me, nor so clearly explained
to me, the vanity of this world.

7. The Truth of which I am speaking, and which I was given to
see, is Truth Itself, in Itself.  It has neither beginning nor
end.  All other truths depend on this Truth, as all other loves
depend on this love, and all other grandeurs on this grandeur.
I understood it all, notwithstanding that my words are obscure in
comparison with that distinctness with which it pleased our Lord
to show it to me.  What think you must be the power of His
Majesty, seeing that in so short a time it leaves so great a
blessing and such an impression on the soul?  O Grandeur!
Majesty of mine! what is it Thou art doing, O my Lord Almighty!
Consider who it is to whom Thou givest blessings so great!  Dost
Thou not remember that this my soul has been an abyss of lies and
a sea of vanities, and all my fault?  Though Thou hadst given me
a natural hatred of lying yet I did involve myself in many lying
ways.  How is this, O my God? how can it be that mercies and
graces so great should fall to the lot of one who has so ill
deserved them at Thy hands?

8. Once, when I was with the whole community reciting the Office,
my soul became suddenly recollected, and seemed to me all bright
as a mirror, clear behind, sideways, upwards, and downwards; and
in the centre of it I saw Christ our Lord, as I usually see Him.
It seemed to me that I saw Him distinctly in every part of my
soul, as in a mirror, and at the same time the mirror was all
sculptured--I cannot explain it--in our Lord Himself by a most
loving communication which I can never describe.  I know that
this vision was a great blessing to me, and is still whenever I
remember it, particularly after Communion.

9. I understood by it, that, when a soul is in mortal sin, this
mirror becomes clouded with a thick vapour, and utterly obscured,
so that our Lord is neither visible nor present, though He is
always present in the conservation of its being.  In heretics,
the mirror is, as it were, broken in pieces, and that is worse
than being dimmed.  There is a very great difference between
seeing this and describing it, for it can hardly be explained.
But it has done me great good; it has also made me very sorry on
account of those times when I dimmed the lustre of my soul by my
sins, so that I could not see our Lord.

10. This vision seems to me very profitable to recollected
persons, to teach them to look upon our Lord as being in the
innermost part of their soul.  It is a method of looking upon Him
which penetrates us more thoroughly, and is much more fruitful,
than that of looking upon Him as external to us, as I have said
elsewhere, [4] and as it is laid down in books on prayer, where
they speak of where we are to seek God.  The glorious
St. Augustin, [5] in particular, says so, when he says that
neither in the streets of the city, nor in pleasures, nor in any
place whatever where he sought Him, did he find Him as he found
Him within himself.  This is clearly the best way; we need not go
up to heaven, nor any further than our own selves, for that would
only distress the spirit and distract the soul, and bring but
little fruit.

11. I should like to point out one result of a deep trance; it
may be that some are aware of it.  When the time is over during
which the soul was in union, wherein all its powers were wholly
absorbed,--it lasts, as I have said, [6] but a moment,--the soul
continues still to be recollected, unable to recover itself even
in outward things; for the two powers--the memory and the
understanding--are, as it were, in a frenzy, extremely
disordered.  This, I say, happens occasionally, particularly in
the beginnings.  I am thinking whether it does not result from
this: that our natural weakness cannot endure the vehemence of
the spirit, which is so great, and that the imagination is
enfeebled.  I know it to be so with some.  I think it best for
these to force themselves to give up prayer at that time, and
resume it afterwards, when they may recover what they have lost,
and not do everything at once, for in that case much harm might
come of it.  I know this by experience, as well as the necessity
of considering what our health can bear.

12. Experience is necessary throughout, so also is a spiritual
director; for when the soul has reached this point, there are
many matters which must be referred to the director.  If, after
seeking such a one, the soul cannot find him, our Lord will not
fail that soul, seeing that He has not failed me, who am what I
am: They are not many, I believe, who know by experience so many
things, and without experience it is useless to treat a soul at
all, for nothing will come of it, save only trouble and distress.
But our Lord will take this also into account, and for that
reason it is always best to refer the matter to the director.
I have already more than once said this, [7] and even all I am
saying now, only I do not distinctly remember it; but I do see
that it is of great importance, particularly to women, that they
should go to their confessor, and that he should be a man of
experience herein.  There are many more women than men to whom
our Lord gives these graces; I have heard the holy friar Peter of
Alcantara say so, and, indeed, I know it myself.  He used to say
that women made greater progress in this way than men did; and he
gave excellent reasons for his opinion, all in favour of women;
but there is no necessity for repeating them here.

13. Once, when in prayer, I had a vision, for a moment,--I saw
nothing distinctly, but the vision was most clear,--how all
things are seen in God and how all things are comprehended in
Him.  I cannot in any way explain it, but the vision remains most
deeply impressed on my soul, and is one of those grand graces
which our Lord wrought in me, and one of those which put me to
the greatest shame and confusion whenever I call my sins to
remembrance.  I believe, if it had pleased our Lord that I had
seen this at an earlier time, or if they saw it who sin against
Him, we should have neither the heart nor the daring to do so.
I had the vision, I repeat it, but I cannot say that I saw
anything; however, I must have seen something, seeing that I
explain it by an illustration, only it must have been in a way so
subtile and delicate that the understanding is unable to reach
it, or I am so ignorant in all that relates to these visions,
which seem to be not imaginary.  In some of these visions there
must be something imaginary, only, as the powers of the soul are
then in a trance, they are not able afterwards to retain the
forms, as our Lord showed them to it then, and as He would have
it rejoice in them.

14. Let us suppose the Godhead to be a most brilliant diamond,
much larger than the whole world, or a mirror like that to which
I compared the soul in a former vision, [8] only in a way so high
that I cannot possibly describe it; and that all our actions are
seen in that diamond, which is of such dimensions as to include
everything, because nothing can be beyond it.  It was a fearful
thing for me to see, in so short a time, so many things together
in that brilliant diamond, and a most piteous thing too, whenever
I think of it, to see such foul things as my sins present in the
pure brilliancy of that light.

15. So it is, whenever I remember it, I do not know how to bear
it, and I was then so ashamed of myself that I knew not where to
hide myself.  Oh, that some one could make this plain to those
who commit most foul and filthy sins, that they may remember
their sins are not secret, and that God most justly resents them,
seeing that they are wrought in the very presence of His Majesty,
and that we are demeaning ourselves so irreverently before Him!
I saw, too, how completely hell is deserved for only one mortal
sin, and how impossible it is to understand the exceeding great
wickedness of committing it in the sight of majesty so great, and
how abhorrent to His nature such actions are.  In this we see
more and more of His mercifulness, who, though we all know His
hatred of sin, yet suffers us to live.

16. The vision made me also reflect, that if one such vision as
this fills the souls with such awe, what will it be in the day of
judgment, when His Majesty will appear distinctly, and when we
too shall look on the sins we have committed!  O my God, I have
been, oh, how blind!  I have often been amazed at what I have
written; and you, my father, be you not amazed at anything, but
that I am still living,--I, who see such things, and know myself
to be what I am.  Blessed for ever be He who has borne with me
so long!

17. Once, in prayer, with much recollection, sweetness, and
repose, I saw myself, as it seemed to me, surrounded by angels,
and was close unto God.  I began to intercede with His Majesty on
behalf of the church.  I was given to understand the great
services which a particular Order would render in the latter
days, and the courage with which its members would maintain
the faith.

18. I was praying before the most Holy Sacrament one day; I had a
vision of a Saint, whose Order was in some degree fallen. In his
hands he held a large book, which he opened, and then told me to
read certain words, written in large and very legible letters;
they were to this effect: "In times to come this Order will
flourish; it will have many martyrs." [9]

19. On another occasion, when I was at Matins in choir, six or
seven persons, who seemed to me to be of this Order, appeared and
stood before me with swords in their hands.  The meaning of that,
as I think, is that they are to be defenders of the faith; for at
another time, when I was in prayer, I fell into a trance, and
stood in spirit on a wide plain, where many persons were
fighting; and the members of this Order were fighting with great
zeal.  Their faces were beautiful, and as it were on fire.
Many they laid low on the ground defeated, others they killed.
It seemed to me to be a battle with heretics.

20. I have seen this glorious Saint occasionally, and he has told
me certain things, and thanked me for praying for his Order, and
he has promised to pray for me to our Lord.  I do not say which
Orders these are,--our Lord, if it so pleased Him, could make
them known,--lest the others should be aggrieved.  Let every
Order, or every member of them by himself, labour, that by his
means our Lord would so bless his own Order that it may serve Him
in the present grave necessities of His Church.  Blessed are they
whose lives are so spent.

21. I was once asked by a person to pray God to let him know
whether his acceptance of a bishopric would be for the service of
God.  After Communion our Lord said to me: "When he shall have
clearly and really understood that true dominion consists in
possessing nothing, he may then accept it."  I understood by this
that he who is to be in dignity must be very far from wishing or
desiring it, or at least he must not seek it.

22. These and many other graces our Lord has given, and is giving
continually, to me a sinner.  I do not think it is necessary to
speak of them, because the state of my soul can be ascertained
from what I have written; so also can the spirit which our Lord
has given me.  May He be blessed for ever, who has been so
mindful of me!

23. Our Lord said to me once, consoling me, that I was not to
distress myself,--this He said most lovingly,--because in this
life we could not continue in the same state. [10]  At one time I
should be fervent, at another not; now disquieted, and again at
peace, and tempted; but I must hope in Him, and fear not.

24. I was one day thinking whether it was a want of detachment in
me to take pleasure in the company of those who had the care of
my soul, and to have an affection for them, and to comfort myself
with those whom I see to be very great servants of God. [11]
Our Lord said to me: "It is not a virtue in a sick man to abstain
from thanking and loving the physician who seems to restore him
to health when he is in danger of death.  What should I have done
without these persons?  The conversation of good people was never
hurtful; my words should always be weighed, and holy; and I was
not to cease my relations with them, for they would do me good
rather than harm."

25. This was a great comfort to me, because, now and then, I
wished to abstain from converse with all people; for it seemed to
me that I was attached to them.  Always, in all things, did our
Lord console me, even to the showing me how I was to treat those
who were weak, and some other people also.  Never did He cease to
take care of me.  I am sometimes distressed to see how little I
do in His service, and how I am forced to spend time in taking
care of a body so weak and worthless as mine is, more than
I wish.

26. I was in prayer one night, when it was time to go to sleep.
I was in very great pain, and my usual sickness was coming
on. [12]  I saw myself so great a slave to myself, and, on the
other hand, the spirit asked for time for itself.  I was so much
distressed that I began to weep exceedingly, and to be very
sorry.  This has happened to me not once only, but, as I am
saying, very often; and it seems to make me weary of myself, so
that at the time I hold myself literally in abhorrence.
Habitually, however, I know that I do not hate myself, and I
never fail to take that which I see to be necessary for me.
May our Lord grant that I do not take more than is necessary!--I
am afraid I do.

27. When I was thus distressed, our Lord appeared unto me.
He comforted me greatly, and told me I must do this for His love,
and bear it; my life was necessary now.  And so, I believe, I
have never known real pain since I resolved to serve my Lord and
my Consoler with all my strength; for though he would leave me to
suffer a little, yet He would console me in such a way that I am
doing nothing when I long for troubles.  And it seems to me there
is nothing worth living for but this, and suffering is what I
most heartily pray to God for.  I say to Him sometimes, with my
whole heart: "O Lord, either to die or to suffer!  I ask of Thee
nothing else for myself."  It is a comfort to me to hear the
clock strike, because I seem to have come a little nearer to the
vision of God, in that another hour of my life has passed away.

28. At other times I am in such a state that I do not feel that I
am living, nor yet do I desire to die but I am lukewarm, and
darkness surrounds me on every side, as I said before; [13] for I
am very often in great trouble.  It pleased our Lord that the
graces He wrought in me should be published abroad, [14] as He
told me some years ago they should be.  It was a great pain to
me, and I have borne much on that account even to this day, as
you, my father, know, because every man explains them in his own
sense.  But my comfort herein is that it is not my fault that
they are become known, for I was extremely cautious never to
speak of them but to my confessors, or to persons who I knew had
heard of them from them.  I was silent, however, not out of
humility, but because, as I said before, [15] it gave me great
pain to speak of them even to my confessors.

29. Now, however,--to God be the glory!--though many speak
against me, but out of a zeal for goodness, and though some are
afraid to speak to me, and even to hear my confession, and though
others have much to say about me, because I see that our Lord
willed by this means to provide help for many souls,--and also
because I see clearly and keep in mind how much He would suffer,
if only for the gaining of one,--I do not care about it at all.

30. I know not why it is so, but perhaps the reason may in some
measure be that His Majesty has placed me in this corner out of
the way, where the enclosure is so strict, and where I am as one
that is dead.  I thought that no one would remember me, but I am
not so much forgotten as I wish I was, for I am forced to speak
to some people.  But as I am in a house where none may see me, it
seems as if our Lord had been pleased to bring me to a haven,
which I trust in His Majesty will be secure.  Now that I am out
of the world, with companions holy and few in number, I look down
on the world as from a great height, and care very little what
people say or know about me.  I think much more of one soul's
advancement, even if it were but slight, than of all that people
may say of me; and since I am settled here it has pleased our
Lord that all my desires tend to this.

31. He has made my life to me now a kind of sleep; for almost
always what I see seems to me to be seen as in a dream, nor have
I any great sense either of pleasure or of pain.  If matters
occur which may occasion either, the sense of it passes away so
quickly that it astonishes me, and leaves an impression as if I
had been dreaming,--and this is the simple truth; for if I wished
afterwards to delight in that pleasure, or be sorry over that
pain, it is not in my power to do so: just as a sensible person
feels neither pain nor pleasure in the memory of a dream that is
past; for now our Lord has roused my soul out of that state
which, because I was not mortified nor dead to the things of this
world, made me feel as I did, and His Majesty does not wish me to
become blind again.

32. This is the way I live now, my lord and father; do you, my
father, pray to God that He would take me to Himself, or enable
me to serve Him.  May it please His Majesty that what I have
written may be of some use to you, my father!  I have so little
time, [16] and therefore my trouble has been great in writing;
but it will be a blessed trouble if I have succeeded in saying
anything that will cause one single act of praise to our Lord.
If that were the case, I should look upon myself as sufficiently
rewarded, even if you, my father, burnt at once what I have
written.  I would rather it were not burnt before those three saw
it, whom you, my father, know of, because they are, and have
been, my confessors; for if it be bad, it is right they should
lose the good opinion they have of me; and if it be good, they
are good and learned men, and I know they will recognise its
source, and give praise to Him who hath spoken through me.

33. May His Majesty ever be your protector, and make you so great
a saint that your spirit and light may show the way to me a
miserable creature, so wanting in humility and so bold as to have
ventured to write on subjects so high!  May our Lord grant I have
not fallen into any errors in the matter, for I had the intention
and the desire to be accurate and obedient, and also that through
me He might, in some measure, have glory,--because that is what I
have been praying for these many years; and as my good works are
inefficient for that end, I have ventured to put in order this my
disordered life.  Still, I have not wasted more time, nor given
it more attention, than was necessary for writing it; yet I have
put down all that has happened to me with all the simplicity and
sincerity possible.

34. May our Lord, who is all-powerful, grant--and He can if He
will--that I may attain to the doing of His will in all things!
May He never suffer this soul to be lost, which He so often, in
so many ways, and by so many means, has rescued from hell and
drawn unto Himself!  Amen.


I.H.S.

The Holy Spirit be ever with you, my father. [17]  Amen.
It would not be anything improper if I were to magnify my labour
in writing this, to oblige you to be very careful to recommend me
to our Lord; for indeed I may well do so, considering what I have
gone through in giving this account of myself, and in retracing
my manifold wretchedness.  But, still, I can say with truth that
I felt it more difficult to speak of the graces which I have
received from our Lord than to speak of my offences against His
Majesty.  You, my father, commanded me to write at length; that
is what I have done, on condition that you will do what you
promised, namely, destroy everything in it that has the
appearance of being wrong.  I had not yet read it through after I
had written it, when your reverence sent for it.  Some things in
it may not be very clearly explained, and there may be some
repetitions; for the time I could give to it was so short, that I
could not stop to see what I was writing.  I entreat your
reverence to correct it and have it copied, if it is to be sent
on to the Father-Master, Avila, [18] for perhaps some one may
recognise the handwriting.  I wish very much you would order it
so that he might see it, for I began to write it with a view to
that I shall be greatly comforted if he shall think that I am on
a safe road, now that, so far as it concerns me, there is nothing
more to be done.

Your reverence will do in all things that which to you shall seem
good, and you will look upon yourself as under an obligation to
take care of one who trusts her soul to your keeping.  I will
pray for the soul of your reverence to our Lord, so long as I
live.  You will, therefore, be diligent in His service, in order
that you may be able to help me; for your reverence will see by
what I have written how profitable it is to give oneself, as your
reverence has begun to do, wholly unto Him who gives Himself to
us so utterly without measure.

Blessed be His Majesty for ever!  I hope of His mercy we shall
see one another one day, when we, your reverence and myself,
shall see more clearly the great mercies He has shown us, and
when we shall praise Him for ever and ever.  Amen.  This book was
finished in June, 1562.

preference, setting aside as insufficient the testimony of Fray
Luis of the Assumption, who says he heard himself from the
Venerable Anne of St. Bartholomew that the Order in question is
the Order of our Lady of Mount Carmel.  Don Vicente, the Spanish
editor, rejects the opinion of Ribera, on the ground that it
could not have been truly said of the Dominicans in the sixteenth
century that the Order was in "some degree fallen," for it was in
a most flourishing state.  He therefore was inclined to believe
that the Saint referred to the Augustinians or to the
Franciscans.  But, after he had printed this part of his book, he
discovered among the MSS. in the public library of Madrid a
letter of Anne of St. Bartholomew, addressed to Fray Luis of the
Assumption, in which the saintly companion of St. Teresa says
that the "Order was ours."  Don Vicente has published the letter

St. Teresa Submitted to Her Confessors.




The Relations.


Relation 1.


Sent to St. Peter of Alcantara in 1560 from the Monastery of the
Incarnation, Avila. [1]


1. The method of prayer I observe at present is this: when I am
in prayer, it is very rarely that I can use the understanding,
because the soul becomes at once recollected, remains in repose,
or falls into a trance, so that I cannot in any way have the use
of the faculties and the senses,--so much so, that the hearing
alone is left; but then it does not help me to
understand anything.

2. It often happens, when I am not even thinking of the things of
God, but engaged in other matters, and when prayer seems to be
beyond my power, whatever efforts I might make, because of the
great aridity I am in, bodily pains contributing thereto, that
this recollection or elevation of spirit comes upon me so
suddenly that I cannot withstand it, and the fruits and blessings
it brings with it are in a moment mine: and this, without my
having had a vision, or heard anything, or knowing where I am,
except that when the soul seems to be lost I see it make great
progress, which I could not have made if I had laboured for a
whole year, so great is my gain.

3. At other times certain excessive impetuosities occur,
accompanied with a certain fainting away of the soul for God, so
that I have no control over myself; [2] my life seems to have
come to an end, and so it makes me cry out and call upon God; and
this comes upon me with great vehemence.  Sometimes I cannot
remain sitting, so great is the oppression of the heart; and this
pain comes on without my doing anything to cause it, and the
nature of it is such that my soul would be glad never to be
without it while I live.  And the longings I have are longings
not to live; and they come on because it seems as if I must live
on without being able to find any relief, for relief comes from
the vision of God, which comes by death, and death is what I
cannot take; and with all this my soul thinks that all except
itself are filled with consolations, and that all find help in
their troubles, but not itself.  The distress thus occasioned is
so intense that, if our Lord did not relieve it by throwing it
into a trance, whereby all is made calm, and the soul rests in
great quiet and is satisfied, now by seeing something of that
which it desires, now by hearing other things, it would seem to
be impossible for it to be delivered from this pain.

4. At other times there come upon me certain desires to serve
God, with a vehemence so great that I cannot describe it, and
accompanied with a certain pain at seeing how unprofitable I am.
It seems to me then that there is nothing in the world, neither
death, nor martyrdom, that I could not easily endure.
This conviction, too, is not the result of any reflection, but
comes in a moment.  I am wholly changed, and I know not whence
cometh such great courage.  I think I should live to raise my
voice, and publish to all the world how important it is for men
not to be satisfied with the common way, and how great the good
is that God will give us if we prepare ourselves to receive it.
I say it again, these desires are such that I am melted away in
myself, for I seem to desire what I cannot have.  The body seems
to me to hold me in prison, through its inability to serve God
and my state [3] in anything; for if it were not for the body, I
might do very great things, so far as my strength would allow;
and thus, because I see myself without any power whatever to
serve God, I feel this pain in a way wholly indescribable; the
issue is delight, recollection, and the consolation of God.

5. Again, it has happened, when these longings to serve Him come
upon me, that I wish to do penance, but I am not able.  It would
be a great relief to me, and it does relieve and cheer me, though
what I do is almost nothing, because of my bodily weakness; and
yet, if I were to give way to these my longings, I believe I
should observe no moderation.

6. Sometimes, if I have to speak to any one, I am greatly
distressed, and I suffer so much that it makes me weep
abundantly; for my whole desire is to be alone, and solitude
comforts me, though at times I neither pray nor read, and
conversation--particularly of kindred and connections--seems
oppressive, and myself to be as a slave, except when I speak to
those whose conversation is of prayer and matters of the
soul,--in these I find comfort and joy; [4] yet these
occasionally are too much for me, and I would rather not see
them, but go where I might be alone: though this is not often the
case, for those especially who direct my conscience always
console me.

7. At other times it gives me much pain that I must eat and
sleep, and that I see I cannot forego these things, being less
able to do so than any one.  I submit that I may serve God, and
thus I offer up those actions to him.  Time seems to me too
short, and that I have not enough for my prayer, for I should
never be tired of being alone.  I am always wishing I had time
for reading, for I have been always fond of reading.  I read very
little, for when I take up a book I become recollected through
the pleasure it gives me, and thus my reading is turned into
prayer: and it is but rarely, for I have many occupations; and
though they are good, they do not give me the pleasure which
reading would give.  And thus I am always wishing for more time,
and everything becomes disagreeable, so I believe, because I see
I cannot do what I wish and desire.

8. All these desires, with an increase in virtue, have been given
me by our Lord since He raised me to this prayer of quiet, and
sent these raptures.  I find myself so improved that I look on
myself as being a mass of perdition before this.  These raptures
and visions leave me in possession of the blessings I shall now
speak of; and I maintain that, if there be any good in me, they
are the occasions of it.

9. I have made a very strong resolution never to offend God, not
even venially.  I would rather die a thousand deaths than do
anything of the kind knowingly.  I am resolved never to leave
undone anything I may consider to be the more perfect, or more
for the honour of our Lord, if he who has the care of my soul and
directs me tells me I may do it.  Cost me what pain it might, I
would not leave such an act undone for all the treasure of the
world.  If I were to do so, I do not think I could have the face
to ask anything of God our Lord, or to make my prayer; and yet,
for all this, I have many faults and imperfections.  I am
obedient to my confessor, [5] though imperfectly; but if I know
that he wishes or commands anything, I would not leave that
undone, so far as I understand it; if I did so, I should think
myself under a grievous delusion.

10. I have a longing for poverty, though not free from
imperfection; however, I believe, if I had wealth, I would not
reserve any revenue, nor hoard money for myself, nor do I care
for it; I wish to have only what is necessary.  Nevertheless, I
feel that I am very defective in this virtue; for, though I
desire nothing for myself, I should like to have something to
give away: still, I desire no revenue, nor anything
for myself. [6]

11. In almost all the visions I have had, I have found good, if
it be not a delusion of Satan; herein I submit myself to the
judgment of my confessors.

12. As to fine and beautiful things, such as water, fields,
perfume, music, etc., I think I would rather not have them, so
great is the difference between them and what I am in the habit
of seeing, and so all pleasure in them is gone from me. [7]
Hence it is that I care not for them, unless it be at the first
sight: they never make any further impression; to me they seem
but dirt.

13. If I speak or converse with people in the world--for I cannot
help it--even about prayer, and if the conversation be long,
though to pass away the time, I am under great constraint if it
be not necessary, for it gives me much pain.

14. Amusements, of which I used to be fond, and worldly things,
are all disagreeable to me now, and I cannot look at them.

15. The longings, which I said I have, [8] of loving and serving
and seeing God, are not helped by any reflections, as formerly,
when I thought I was very devout, and shed many tears; but they
flow out of a certain fire and heat so excessive that, I repeat
it, if God did not relieve them by throwing me into a trance,
wherein the soul seems to find itself satisfied, I believe my
life would come to an end at once.

16. When I see persons making great progress, and thus resolved,
detached, and courageous, I love them much; and I should like to
have my conversation with such persons, and I think they help me
on.  People who are afraid, and seemingly cautious in those
things, the doing of which is perfectly reasonable here, seem to
vex me, and drive me to pray to God and the saints to make them
undertake such things as these which now frighten us.  Not that I
am good for anything myself, but because I believe that God helps
those who, for His sake, apply themselves to great things, and
that He never abandons any one who puts his trust in Him only.
And I should like to find any one who would help me to believe
so, and to be without thought about food and raiment, but leave
it all in the hands of God. [9]

17. This leaving in the hands of God the supply of all I need is
not to be understood as excluding all labour on my part, but
merely solicitude--I mean, the solicitude of care.  And since I
have attained to this liberty, it goes well with me, and I labour
to forget myself as much as I can.  I do not think it is a year
ago since our Lord gave me this liberty.

18. Vainglory [10]--glory, be to God!--so far as I know, there is
no reason why I should have any; for I see plainly that in these
things which God sends me I have no part myself; on the contrary,
God makes me conscious of my own wretchedness; for whatever
reflections I might be able to make, I could never come to the
knowledge of such deep truths as I attain to in a single rapture.

19. When I speak of these things a few days after, they seem to
me as if they had happened to another person.  Previously, I
thought it a wrong to me that they should be known to others; but
I see now that I am not therefore any the better, but rather
worse, seeing that I make so little progress after receiving
mercies so great.  And certainly, in every way, it seems to me
that there was not in the world anybody worse than myself; and so
the virtues of others seem to me much more meritorious than mine,
and that I do nothing myself but receive graces, and that God
must give to others at once all that He is now giving unto me;
and I pray Him not to reward me in this life; and so I believe
that God has led me along this way because I am weak and wicked.

20. When I am in prayer, and even almost always when I am able to
reflect at all, I cannot, even if I tried, pray to God for rest,
or desire it; for I see that His life was one of suffering, and
that I ask Him to send me, giving me first the grace to bear it.

21. Everything of this kind, and of the highest perfection, seems
to make so deep an impression on me in prayer, that I am amazed
at the sight of truths so great and so clear that the things of
the world seem to be folly; and so it is necessary for me to take
pains to reflect on the way I demeaned myself formerly in the
things of the world, for it seems to me folly to feel for deaths
and the troubles of the world,--at least, that sorrow for, or
love of, kindred and friends should last long.  I say I have to
take pains when I am considering what I was, and what I used to
feel.

22. If I see people do anything which clearly seems to be sin, I
cannot make up my mind that they have offended God; and if I
dwell upon this at all,--which happens rarely or never,--I never
can make up my mind, though I see it plainly enough.  It seems to
me that everybody is as anxious to serve God as I am.  And herein
God has been very gracious unto me, for I never dwell on an evil
deed, to remember it afterwards and if I do remember it, I see
some virtue or other in that person.  In this way these things
never weary me, except generally: but heresies do; they distress
me very often, and almost always when I think of them they seem
to me to be the only trouble which should be felt.  And also I
feel, when I see people who used to give themselves to prayer
fall away; this gives me pain, but not much, because I strive not
to dwell upon it.

23. I find, also, that I am improved in the matter of that
excessive neatness which I was wont to observe, [11] though not
wholly delivered from it.  I do not discern that I am always
mortified in this; sometimes, however, I do.

24. All this I have described, together with a very constant
dwelling in thought on God, is the ordinary state of my soul, so
far as I can understand it.  And if I must be busy about
something else, without my seeking it, as I said before, [12] I
know not who makes me awake,--and this not always, only when I am
busy with things of importance; and such--glory be to God!--only
at intervals demand my attention, and do not occupy me at
all times.

25. For some days--they are not many, however--for three, or
four, or five, all my good and fervent thoughts, and my visions,
seem to be withdrawn, yea, even forgotten, so that, if I were to
seek for it, I know of no good that can ever have been in me.  It
seems to have been all a dream, or, at least, I can call nothing
to mind.  Bodily pains at the same time distress me.
My understanding is troubled, so that I cannot think at all about
God, neither do I know under what law I live.  If I read
anything, I do not understand it; I seem to be full of faults,
and without any resolution whatever to practise virtue; and the
great resolution I used to have is come to this, that I seem to
be unable to resist the least temptation or slander of the world.
It suggests itself to me then that I am good for nothing, if any
one would have me undertake more than the common duties.  I give
way to sadness, thinking I have deceived all those who trusted me
at all.  I should like to hide myself where nobody could see me;
but my desire for solitude arises from want of courage, not from
love of virtue.  It seems to me that I should like to dispute
with all who contradict me; I am under the influence of these
impressions, only God has been so gracious unto me, that I do not
offend more frequently than I was wont to do, nor do I ask Him to
deliver me from them, but only, if it be His will I should always
suffer thus, to keep me from offending Him; and I submit myself
to His will with my whole heart, and I see that it is a very
great grace bestowed upon me that He does not keep me constantly
in this state.

26. One thing astonishes me; it is that, while I am in this
state, through a single word of those I am in the habit of
hearing, or a single vision, or a little self-recollection,
lasting but an Ave Maria, or through my drawing near to
communicate, I find my soul and body so calm, so sound, the
understanding so clear, and myself possessing all the strength
and all the good desires I usually have.  And this I have had
experience of very often--at least when I go to Communion; it is
more than six months ago that I felt a clear improvement in my
bodily health, [13] and that occasionally brought about through
raptures, and I find it last sometimes more than three hours, at
other times I am much stronger for a whole day; and I do not
think it is fancy, for I have considered the matter, and
reflected on it.  Accordingly, when I am thus recollected, I fear
no illness.  The truth is, that when I pray, as I was accustomed
to do before, I feel no improvement.

27. All these things of which I am speaking make me believe that
it comes from God; for when I see what I once was, that I was in
the way of being lost, and that soon, my soul certainly is
astonished at these things, without knowing whence these virtues
came to me; I did not know myself, and saw that all was a gift,
and not the fruit of my labours.  I understand in all
truthfulness and sincerity, and see that I am not deluded, that
it has been not only the means of drawing me to God in His
service, but of saving me also from hell.  This my confessors
know, who have heard my general confession.

28. Also, when I see any one who knows anything about me, I wish
to let him know my whole life, [14] because my honour seems to me
to consist in the honour of our Lord, and I care for nothing
else.  This He knows well, or I am very blind; for neither
honour, nor life, nor praise, nor good either of body or of soul,
can interest me, nor do I seek or desire any advantage, only His
glory.  I cannot believe that Satan has sought so many means of
making my soul advance, in order to lose it after all.  I do not
hold him to be so foolish.  Nor can I believe it of God, though I
have deserved to fall into delusions because of my sins, that He
has left unheeded so many prayers of so many good people for two
years, and I do nothing else but ask everybody to pray to our
Lord that He would show me if this be for His glory, or lead me
by another way. [15]  I do not believe that these things would
have been permitted by His Majesty to be always going on if they
were not His work.  These considerations, and the reasons of so
many saintly men, give me courage when I am under the pressure of
fear that they are not from God, I being so wicked myself.
But when I am in prayer, and during those days when I am in
repose, and my thoughts fixed on God, if all the learned and holy
men in the world came together and put me to, all conceivable
tortures, and I, too, desirous of agreeing with them, they could
not make me believe that this is the work of Satan, for I cannot.
And when they would have had me believe it, I was afraid, seeing
who it was that said so; and I thought that they must be saying
what was true, and that I, being what I was, must have been
deluded.  But all they had said to me was destroyed by the first
word, or recollection, or vision that came, and I was able to
resist no longer, and believed it was from God. [16]

29. However, I can think that Satan now and then may intermeddle
here, and so it is, as I have seen and said; but he produces
different results, nor can he, as it seems to me, deceive any one
possessed of any experience.  Nevertheless, I say that, though I
do certainly believe this to be from God, I would never do
anything, for any consideration whatever, that is not judged by
him who has the charge of my soul to be for the better service of
our Lord, and I never had any intention but to obey without
concealing anything, for that is my duty.  I am very often
rebuked for my faults, and that in such a way as to pierce me to
the very quick; and I am warned when there is, or when there may
be, any danger in what I am doing.  These rebukes and warnings
have done me much good, in often reminding me of my former sins,
which make me exceedingly sorry.

30. I have been very long, but this is the truth,--that, when I
rise from my prayer, I see that I have received blessings which
seem too briefly described.  Afterwards I fall into many
imperfections, and am unprofitable and very wicked.  And perhaps
I have no perception of what is good, but am deluded; still, the
difference in my life is notorious, and compels me to think over
all I have said--I mean, that which I verily believe I have felt.
These are the perfections which I feel our Lord has wrought in
me, who am so wicked and so imperfect.  I refer it all to your
judgment, my father, for you know the whole state of my soul.


1. Fra Anton. a Sancto Joseph, in his notes on this Relation,
usually published among the letters of the Saint, ed. Doblado,
vol. ii. letter 11, says it was written for St. Peter of
Alcantara when he came to Avila in 1560, at the time when the
Saint was so severely tried by her confessors and the others who
examined her spirit, and were convinced that her prayer was a
delusion of Satan: see the Life, ch. xxv. § 18.  The following
notes were discovered among the papers of the Saint in the
monastery of the Incarnation, and are supposed to refer to this
Relation.  The Chronicler of the Order, Fra Francis a Sancta
Maria, is inclined to the belief that they were written by
St. Peter of Alcantara, to whom the Relation is addressed, and
the more so because Ribera does not claim them for any member of
the Society, notwithstanding the reference to them in §§ 22, 28.

"1. The end God has in view is the drawing a soul to himself;
that of the devil is the withdrawing it from God.  Our Lord never
does anything whereby anyone may be separated from Him, and the
devil does nothing whereby any one may be made to draw near unto
God.  All the visions and the other operations in the soul of
this person draw her nearer unto God, and make her more humble
and obedient.

"2. It is the teaching of St. Thomas that an angel of light may
be recognised by the peace and quietness he leaves in the soul.
She is never visited in this way, but she afterwards abides in
peace and joy; so much so, that all the pleasures of earth
together are not comparable to one of these visitations.

"3. She never commits a fault, nor falls into an imperfection,
without being instantly rebuked by Him who speaks interiorly
to her.

"4. She has never prayed for nor wished for them: all she wishes
for is to do the will of God our Lord in all things.

"5. Everything herein is consistent with the Scriptures and the
teaching of the Church, and most true, according to the most
rigorous principles of scholastic theology.

"6. This soul is most pure and sincere, with the most fervent
desires of being pleasing unto God, and of trampling on every
earthly thing.

"7. She has been told that whatever she shall ask of God, being
good, she shall have.  She has asked much, and things not
convenient to put on paper lest it should be wearisome; all of
which our Lord has granted.

"8. When these operations are from God, they are always directed
to the good of the recipient, to that of the community, or of
some other.  That she has profited by them she knows by
experience, and she knows it, too, of other persons also.

"9. No one converses with her, if he be not in evil dispositions,
who is not moved thereby to devotion, even though she says
nothing about it.

"10. She is growing daily in the perfection of virtues, and
learns by these things the way of a higher perfection.  And thus,
during the whole time in which she had visions, she was making
progress, according to the doctrine of St. Thomas.

"11. The spirit that speaks to her soul never tells her anything
in the way of news, or what is unbecoming, but only that which
tends to edification.

"12. She has been told of some persons that they were full of
devils: but this was for the purpose of enabling her to
understand the state of a soul which has sinned mortally against
our Lord.

"13. The devil's method is, when he attempts to deceive a soul,
to advise that soul never to speak of what he says to it; but the
spirit that speaks to this soul warns her to be open with learned
men, servants of our Lord, and that the devil may deceive her if
she should conceal anything through shame.

"14. So great is the progress of her soul in this way, and the
edification she ministers in the good example given, that more
than forty nuns in her monastery practise great recollection.

"15. These supernatural things occur after long praying, when she
is absorbed in God, on fire with His love, or at Communion.

"16. They kindle in her a most earnest desire to be on the right
road, and to escape the delusions of Satan.

"17. They are in her the cause of the deepest humility; she
understands that what she receives comes to her from the hand of
our Lord, and how little worth she is herself.

"18. When they are withheld, anything that occurs is wont to pain
and distress her; but when she is in this state, she remembers
nothing; all she is conscious of is a great longing for
suffering, and so great is it that she is amazed at it.

"19. They are to her sources of joy and consolation in her
troubles, when people speak ill of her, and in her
infirmities--and she has fearful pains about the heart,
sicknesses, and many other afflictions, all of which leave her
when she has these visions.

"20. With all this, she undergoes great penances, fasting, the
discipline, and mortifications.

"21. All that on earth may give her any pleasure, and her trials,
which are many, she bears with equal tranquillity of mind,
without losing the peace and quiet of her soul.

"22. Her resolution never to offend our Lord is so earnest that
she has made a vow never to leave undone what she knows herself,
or is told by those who understand the matter better, to be the
more perfect.  And though she holds the members of the Society to
be saints, and believes that our Lord made use of them to bestow
on her graces so great, she told me that, if she knew it would be
more perfect to have nothing more to do with them, she would
never speak to them again, nor see them, notwithstanding the fact
that it was through them that her mind had been quieted and
directed in these things.

"23. The sweetnesses she commonly receives, her sense of God, her
languishing with love, are certainly marvellous, and through
these she is wont to be enraptured the whole day long.

"24. She frequently falls into a trance when she hears God spoken
of with devotion and earnestness, and cannot resist the rapture,
do what she can; and in that state her appearance is such that
she excites very great devotion.

"25. She cannot bear to be directed by any one who will not tell
her of her faults, and rebuke her; all that she accepts with
great humility.

"26. Moreover, she cannot endure people who are in a state of
perfection, if they do not labour to become perfect, according to
the spirit of their rule.

"27. She is most detached from her kindred, has no desire to
converse with people, and loves solitude.  She has a great
devotion to the saints, and on their feasts, and on the days on
which the Church celebrates the mysteries of the faith, is filled
with most fervent affections for our Lord.

"28. If all the members of the Society, and all the servants of
God upon earth, tell her that her state is an effect of the
operations of Satan, or were to say so, she is in fear and
trembling before the visions occur; but as soon as she is in
prayer, and recollected, she cannot be persuaded, were they to
tear her into a thousand pieces, that it is any other than God
who is working in her and speaking to her.

"29. God has given her a most wonderfully strong and valiant
spirit: she was once timid; now she tramples on all the evil
spirits.  She has put far away from herself all the littleness
and silliness of women; she is singularly free from scruples, and
most sincere.

"30. Besides, our Lord has given her the gift of most sweet
tears, great compassion for her neighbours, the knowledge of her
own faults, a great reverence for good people, and
self-abasement; and I am certain that she has done good to many,
of whom I am one.

"31. She is continually reminding herself of God, and has a sense
of His presence.  All the locutions have been verified, and every
one of them accomplished; and this is a very great test.

"32. Her visions are a source of great clearness in her
understanding, and an admirable illumination in the things
of God.

"33. It was said to her that she should lead those who were
trying her spirit to look into the Scriptures, and that they
would not find that any soul desirous of pleasing God had been so
long deceived."

Relation II.


To One of Her Confessors, from the House of Doña Luisa de la Cerda,
in 1562. [1]


Jesus.

I think it is more than a year since this was written; God has
all this time protected me with His hand, so that I have not
become worse; on the contrary, I see a great change for the
better in all I have to say: may He be praised for it all!

1. The visions and revelations have not ceased, but they are of a
much higher kind.  Our Lord has taught me a way of prayer,
wherein I find myself far more advanced, more detached from the
things of this life, more courageous, and more free. [2]  I fall
into a trance more frequently, for these ecstasies at times come
upon me with great violence, and in such a way as to be outwardly
visible, I having no power to resist them; and even when I am
with others--for they come in such a way as admits of no
disguising them, unless it be by letting people suppose that, as
I am subject to disease of the heart, they are fainting-fits; I
take great pains, however, to resist them when they are coming
on--sometimes I cannot do it.

2. As to poverty, God seems to have wrought great things in me;
for I would willingly be without even what is necessary, unless
given me as an alms; and therefore my longing is extreme that I
may be in such a state as to depend on alms alone for my food.
It seems to me that to live, when I am certain of food and
raiment without fail, is not so complete an observance of my vow
or of the counsel of Christ as it would be to live where no
revenue is possessed, and I should be in want at times; and as to
the blessings that come with true poverty, they seem to me to be
great, and I would not miss them.  Many times do I find myself
with such great faith, that I do not think God will ever fail
those who serve Him, and without any doubt whatever that there
is, or can be, any time in which His words are not fulfilled: I
cannot persuade myself to the contrary, nor can I have any fear;
and so, when they advise me to accept an endowment, I feel it
keenly, and betake myself unto God.

3. I think I am much more compassionate towards the poor than I
used to be, having a great pity for them and a desire to help
them; for if I regarded only my good will, I should give them
even the habit I wear.  I am not fastidious with respect to them,
even if I had to do with them or touched them with my hands,--and
this I now see is a gift of God; for though I used to give alms
for His love, I had no natural compassion.  I am conscious of a
distinct improvement herein.

4. As to the evil speaking directed against me,--which is
considerable, and highly injurious to me, and done by many,--I
find myself herein also very much the better.  I think that what
they say makes scarcely any more impression upon me than it would
upon an idiot.  I think at times, and nearly always, that it is
just.  I feel it so little that I see nothing in it that I might
offer to God, as I learn by experience that my soul gains greatly
thereby; on the contrary, the evil speaking seems to be a favour.
And thus, the first time I go to prayer, I have no ill-feeling
against them; the first time I hear it, it creates in me a little
resistance, but it neither disturbs nor moves me; on the
contrary, when I see others occasionally disturbed, I am sorry
for them.  So it is, I put myself out of the question; for all
the wrongs of this life seem to me so light, that it is not
possible to feel them, because I imagine myself to be dreaming,
and see that all this will be nothing when I awake.

5. God is giving me more earnest desires, a greater love of
solitude, a much greater detachment, as I said, with the visions;
by these He has made me know what all that is, even if I gave up
all the friends I have, both men and women and kindred.  This is
the least part of it: my kindred are rather a very great
weariness to me; I leave them in all freedom and joy, provided it
be to render the least service unto God; and thus on every side I
find peace.

6. Certain things, about which I have been warned in prayer, have
been perfectly verified.  Thus, considering the graces received
from God, I find myself very much better; but, considering my
service to Him in return, I am exceedingly worthless, for I have
received greater consolation than I have given, though sometimes
that gives me grievous pain.  My penance is very scanty, the
respect shown me great, much against my own will very often. [3]
However in a word, I see that I live an easy, not a penitential,
life; God help me, as He can!

7. It is now nine months, more or less, since I wrote this with
mine own hand; since then I have not turned my back on the graces
which God has given me; I think I have received, so far as I can
see, a much greater liberty of late.  Hitherto I thought I had
need of others, and I had more reliance on worldly helps.  Now I
clearly understand that all men are bunches of dried rosemary,
and that there is no safety in leaning on them, for if they are
pressed by contradictions or evil speaking they break down.
And so I know by experience that the only way not to fall is to
cling to the cross, and put our trust in Him who was nailed
thereto.  I find Him a real Friend, and with Him I find myself
endowed with such might that, God never failing me, I think I
should be able to withstand the whole world if it were
against me.

8. Having a clear knowledge of this truth, I used to be very fond
of being loved by others; now I do not care for that, yea,
rather, their love seems to weary me in some measure, excepting
theirs who take care of my soul, or theirs to whom I think I do
good.  Of the former I wish to be loved, in order that they may
bear with me; and of the latter, that they may be more inclined
to believe me when I tell them that all is vanity.

9. In the very grievous trials, persecutions, and contradictions
of these months, [4] God gave me great courage; and the more
grievous they were, the greater the courage, without weariness in
suffering.  Not only had I no ill-feeling against those who spoke
evil of me, but I had, I believe, conceived a deeper affection
for them.  I know not how it was; certainly it was a gift from
the hand of our Lord.

10. When I desire anything, I am accustomed naturally to desire
it with some vehemence; now my desires are so calm, that I do not
even feel that I am pleased when I see them fulfilled. Sorrow and
joy, excepting in that which relates to prayer, are so moderated,
that I seem to be without sense, and in that state I remain for
some days.

11. The vehement longings to do penance which come, and have
come, upon me are great; and if I do any penance, I feel it to be
so slight in comparison with that longing, that I regard it
sometimes, and almost always, as a special consolation; however,
I do but little, because of my great weakness.

12. It is a very great pain to me very often, and at this moment
most grievous, that I must take food, particularly if I am in
prayer.  It must be very great, for it makes me weep much, and
speak the language of affliction, almost without being aware of
it, and that is what I am not in the habit of doing, for I do not
remember that I ever did so in the very heaviest trials of my
life: I am not a woman in these things, for I have a hard heart.

13. I feel in myself a very earnest desire, more so than usual,
that God may find those who will serve Him, particularly learned
men, in all detachment, and who will not cleave to anything of
this world, for I see it is all a mockery; for when I see the
great needs of the Church, I look upon it as a mockery to be
distressed about aught else.  I do nothing but pray to God for
such men, because I see that one person, who is wholly perfect in
the true fervour of the love of God, will do more good than many
who are lukewarm.

14. In matters concerning the faith, my courage seems to me much
greater.  I think I could go forth alone by myself against the
Lutherans, and convince them of their errors.  I feel very keenly
the loss of so many souls.  I see many persons making great
progress; I see clearly it was the pleasure of God that such
progress should have been helped by me; and I perceive that my
soul, of His goodness, grows daily more and more in His love.

15. I think I could not be led away by vainglory, even if I
seriously tried, and I do not see how I could imagine any one of
my virtues to be mine, for it is not long since I was for many
years without any at all; and now so far as I am concerned, I do
nothing but receive graces, without rendering any service in
return, being the most worthless creature in the world.  And so
it is that I consider at times how all, except myself, make
progress; I am good for nothing in myself.  This is not humility
only, but the simple truth; and the knowledge of my being so
worthless makes me sometimes think with fear that I must be under
some delusion.  Thus I see clearly that all my gain has come
through the revelations and the raptures, in which I am nothing
myself, and do no more to effect them than the canvas does for
the picture painted on it.  This makes me feel secure and be at
rest; and I place myself in the hands of God, and trust my
desires; for I know for certain that my desires are to die for
Him, and to lose all ease, and that whatever may happen.

16. There are days wherein I remember times without number the
words of St. Paul, [5]--though certainly they are not true of
me,--that I have neither life, nor speech, nor will of my own,
but that there is One in me by whom I am directed and made
strong; and I am, as it were, beside myself, and thus life is a
very grievous burden to me.  And the greatest oblation I make to
God, as the highest service on my part, is that I, when I feel it
so painfully to be absent from Him, am willing to live on for the
love of Him.  I would have my life also full of great
tribulations and persecutions; now that I am unprofitable, I
should like to suffer; and I would endure all the tribulations in
the world to gain ever so little more merit--I mean, by a more
perfect doing of His will.

17. Everything that I have learnt in prayer, though it may be two
years previously, I have seen fulfilled.  What I see and
understand of the grandeurs of God, and of the way He has shown
them, is so high, that I scarcely ever begin to think of them but
my understanding fails me,--for I am as one that sees things far
higher than I can understand,--and I become recollected.

18. God so keeps me from offending Him, that I am verily amazed
at times.  I think I discern the great care He takes of me,
without my taking scarcely any care at all, being as I was,
before these things happened to me, a sea of wickedness and sins,
and without a thought that I was mistress enough of myself to
leave them undone.  And the reason why I would have this known is
that the great power of God might be made manifest.  Unto Him be
praise for ever and ever!  Amen.


Jesus.

This Relation here set forth, not in my handwriting, is one that
I gave to my confessor, and which he with his own hand copied,
without adding or diminishing a word.  He was a most spiritual
man and a theologian: I discussed the state of my soul with him,
and he with other learned men, among whom was Father Mancio. [6]
They found nothing in it that is not in perfect agreement with
the holy writings.  This makes me calm now, though, while God is
leading me by this way, I feel that it is necessary for me to put
no trust whatever in myself.  And so I have always done, though
it is painful enough.  You, my father, will be careful that all
this goes under the seal of confession, according to my request.

Relation III.


Of Various Graces Granted to the Saint from the Year 1568 to
1571 Inclusive.


1. When I was in the monastery of Toledo, and some people were
advising me not to allow any but noble persons to be buried
there, [1] our Lord said to me: "Thou wilt be very inconsistent,
My daughter, if thou regardest the laws of the world.  Look at
Me, poor and despised of men: are the great people of the world
likely to be great in My eyes? or is it descent or virtue that is
to make you esteemed?"

2. After Communion, the second day of Lent, in St. Joseph of
Malagon, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me in an imaginary
vision, as He is I wont to do; and when I was looking upon Him I
saw that He had on His head, instead of the crown of thorns, a
crown of great splendour, over the part where the wounds of that
crown must have been.  And as I have a great devotion to the
crowning with thorns, I was exceedingly consoled, and began to
think how great the pain must have been because of the many
wounds, and to be sorrowful.  Our Lord told me not to be sad
because of those wounds, but for the many wounds which men
inflict upon Him now.  I asked Him what I could do by way of
reparation; for I was resolved to do anything.  He replied: "This
is not the time for rest;" that I must hasten on the foundations,
for He would take His rest with the souls which entered the
monasteries; that I must admit all who offered themselves,
because there were many souls that did not serve Him because they
had no place wherein to do it; that those monasteries which were
to be founded in small towns should be like this; that the merit
of those in them would be as great, if they only desired to do
that which was done in the other houses; that I must contrive to
put them all under the jurisdiction of one superior, [2] and take
care that anxieties about means of bodily maintenance did not
destroy interior peace, for He would help us, so that we should
never be in want of food.  Especial care was to be had of the
sick sisters; the prioress who did not provide for and comfort
the sick was like the friends of Job: He sent them sickness for
the good of their souls, and careless superiors risked the
patience of their nuns.  I was to write the history of the
foundation of the monasteries.  I was thinking how there was
nothing to write about in reference to the foundation of Medina,
when He asked me, what more did I want to see than that the
foundation there was miraculous?  By this He meant to say that He
alone had done it, when it seemed impossible. [3]  I resolved to
execute His commands.

3. Our Lord told me something I was to tell another, and as I was
considering how I did not understand it at all,--though I prayed
to Him, and was thinking it might be from Satan,--He said to me
that it was not, and that He Himself would warn me when the
time came.

4. Once, when I was thinking how much more purely they live who
withdraw themselves from all business, and how ill it goes with
me, and how many faults I must be guilty of, when I have business
to transact, I heard this: "It cannot be otherwise, My daughter;
but strive thou always after a good intention in all things, and
detachment; lift up thine eyes to Me, and see that all thine
actions may resemble Mine."

5. Thinking how it was that I scarcely ever fell into a trance of
late in public, I heard this: "It is not necessary now; thou art
sufficiently esteemed for My purpose; we are considering the
weakness of the wicked."

6. One Tuesday after the Ascension, [4] having prayed for awhile
after Communion in great distress, because I was so distracted
that I could fix my mind on nothing, I complained of our poor
nature to our Lord.  The fire began to kindle in my soul, and I
saw, as it seemed to me, the most Holy Trinity [5] distinctly
present in an intellectual vision, whereby my soul understood
through a certain representation, as a figure of the truth, so
far as my dulness could understand, how God is Three and One; and
thus it seemed to me that all the Three Persons spoke to me, that
They were distinctly present in my soul, saying unto me "that
from that day forth I should see that my soul had grown better in
three ways, and that each one of the Three Persons had bestowed
on me a distinct grace,--in charity, in suffering joyfully, in a
sense of that charity in my soul, accompanied with fervour."
I learnt the meaning of those words of our Lord, that the Three
Divine Persons will dwell in the soul that is in a state of
grace. [6]  Afterwards giving thanks to our Lord for so great a
mercy, and finding myself utterly unworthy of it, I asked His
Majesty with great earnestness how it was that He, after showing
such mercies to me, let me go out of His hand, and allowed me to
become so wicked; for on the previous day I had been in great
distress on account of my sins, which I had set before me.  I saw
clearly then how much our Lord on His part had done, ever since
my infancy, to draw me to Himself by means most effectual, and
yet, that all had failed.  Then I had a clear perception of the
surpassing love of God for us, in that He forgives us all this
when we turn to Him, and for me more than for any other, for many
reasons.  The vision of the Three Divine Persons--one God--made
so profound an impression on my soul, that if it had continued it
would have been impossible for me not to be recollected in so
divine a company.  What I saw and heard besides is beyond my
power to describe.

7. Once, when I was about to communicate,--it was shortly before
I had this vision,--the Host being still in the ciborium, for It
had not yet been given me, I saw something like a dove, which
moved its wings with a sound.  It disturbed me so much, and so
carried me away out of myself, that it was with the utmost
difficulty I received the Host.  All this took place in
St. Joseph of Avila.  It was Father Francis Salcedo who was
giving me the most Holy Sacrament.  Hearing Mass another day, I
saw our Lord glorious in the Host; He said to me that his
sacrifice was acceptable unto Him.

8. I heard this once: "The time will come when many miracles will
be wrought in this church; it will be called the holy church."
It was in St. Joseph of Avila, in the year 1571.

9. I retain to this day, which is the Commemoration of St. Paul,
the presence of the Three Persons of which I spoke in the
beginning; [7] they are present almost continually in my soul.
I, being accustomed to the presence of Jesus Christ only, always
thought that the vision of the Three Persons was in some degree a
hindrance, though I know the Three Persons are but One God.
To-day, while thinking of this, our Lord said to me "that I was
wrong in imagining that those things which are peculiar to the
soul can be represented by those of the body; I was to understand
that they were very different, and that the soul had a capacity
for great fruition."  It seemed to me as if this were shown to me
thus: as water penetrates and is drunk in by the sponge, so, it
seemed to me, did the Divinity fill my soul, which in a certain
sense had the fruition and possession of the Three Persons.  And
I heard Him say also: "Labour thou not to hold Me within thyself
enclosed, but enclose thou thyself within Me."  It seemed to me
that I saw the Three Persons within my soul, and communicating
Themselves to all creatures abundantly without ceasing to be
with me.

10. A few days after this, thinking whether they were right who
disapproved of my going out to make new foundations, and whether
it would not be better for me if I occupied myself always with
prayer, I heard this: "During this life, the true gain consists
not in striving after greater joy in Me, but in doing My will."
It seemed to me, considering what St. Paul says about women, how
they should stay at home, [8]--people reminded me lately of this,
and, indeed, I had heard it before,--it might be the will of God
I should do so too.  He said to me: "Tell them they are not to
follow one part of the Scripture by itself, without looking to
the other parts also; perhaps, if they could, they would like to
tie My hands."

11. One day after the octave of the Visitation, in one of the
hermitages of Mount Carmel, praying to God for one of my
brothers, I said to our Lord,--I do not know whether it was only
in thought or not, for my brother was in a place where his
salvation was in peril,--"If I saw one of Thy brethren, O Lord,
in this danger, what would I not do to help him!"  It seemed to
me there was nothing that I could do which I would not have done.
Our Lord said to me: "O daughter, daughter! the nuns of the
Incarnation are thy sisters, and thou holdest back.
Take courage, then.  Behold, this is what I would have thee do:
it is not so difficult as it seems; and though it seems to thee
that by going thither thy foundations will be ruined, yet it is
by thy going that both these and the monastery of the Incarnation
will gain; resist not, for My power is great." [9]

12. Once, when thinking of the great penance practised by Doña
Catalina de Cardona, [10] and how I might have done more,
considering the desires which our Lord had given me at times, if
it had not been for my obedience to my confessors, I asked myself
whether it would not be as well if I disobeyed them for the
future in this matter.  Our Lord said to me: "No, My daughter;
thou art on the sound and safe road.  Seest thou all her penance?
I think more of thy obedience."

13. Once, when I was in prayer, He showed me by a certain kind of
intellectual vision the condition of a soul in a state of grace:
in its company I saw by intellectual vision the most Holy
Trinity, from whose companionship the soul derived a power which
was a dominion over the whole earth.  I understood the meaning of
those words in the Canticle: "Let my Beloved come into His garden
and eat." [11]  He showed me also the condition of a soul in sin,
utterly powerless, like a person tied and bound and blindfold,
who, though anxious to see, yet cannot, being unable to walk or
to hear, and in grievous obscurity.  I was so exceedingly sorry
for such souls, that, to deliver only one, any trouble seemed to
me light.  I thought it impossible for any one who saw this as I
saw it,--and I can hardly explain it,--willingly to forfeit so
great a good or continue in so evil a state.

14. One day, in very great distress about the state of the Order,
and casting about for means to succour it, our Lord said to me:
"Do thou what is in thy power, and leave Me to Myself, and be not
disquieted by anything; rejoice in the blessing thou hast
received, for it is a very great one.  My Father is pleased with
thee, and the Holy Ghost loves thee."

15. "Thou art ever desiring trials, and, on the other hand,
declining them.  I order things according to what I know thy will
is, and not according to thy sensuality and weakness.  Be strong,
for thou seest how I help thee; I have wished thee to gain this
crown. Thou shalt see the Order of the Virgin greatly advanced in
thy days."  I heard this from our Lord about the middle of
February, 1571.

16. On the eve of St. Sebastian, the first year of my being in
the monastery of the Incarnation [12] as prioress there, at the
beginning of the Salve, I saw the Mother of God descend with a
multitude of angels to the stall of the prioress, where the image
of our Lady is, and sit there herself.  I think I did not see the
image then, but only our Lady.  She seemed to be like that
picture of her which the Countess [13] gave me; but I had no time
to ascertain this, because I fell at once into a trance.
Multitudes of angels seemed to me to be above the canopies of the
stalls, and on the desks in front of them; but I saw no bodily
forms, for the vision was intellectual.  She remained there
during the Salve, and said to me: "Thou hast done well to place
me here; I will be present when the sisters sing the praises of
my Son, and will offer them to Him."  After this I remained in
that prayer which I still practise, and which is that of keeping
my soul in the company of the most Holy Trinity; and it seemed to
me that the Person of the Father drew me to Himself, and spoke to
me most comfortable words.  Among them were these, while showing
how He loved me: "I give thee My Son, and the Holy Ghost, and the
Virgin: what canst thou give Me?" [14]

17. On the octave of the Holy Ghost, our Lord was gracious unto
me, and gave me hopes of this house, [15] that it would go on
improving--I mean the souls that are in it.

18. On the feast of the Magdalene, our Lord again confirmed a
grace I had received in Toledo, electing me, in the absence of a
certain person, in her place.

19. In the monastery of the Incarnation, and in the second year
of my being prioress there, on the octave of St. Martin, when I
was going to Communion, the Father, Fr. John of the
Cross, [16]--divided the Host between me and another sister.
I thought it was done, not because there was any want of Hosts,
but that he wished to mortify me because I had told him how much
I delighted in Hosts of a large size.  Yet I was not ignorant
that the size of the Host is of no moment; for I knew that our
Lord is whole and entire in the smallest particle.  His Majesty
said to me: "Have no fear, My daughter; for no one will be able
to separate thee from Me,"--giving me to understand that the size
of the Host mattered not.

20. Then appearing to me, as on other occasions, in an imaginary
vision, most interiorly, He held out His right hand and said:
"Behold this nail! it is the pledge of thy being My bride from
this day forth.  Until now thou hadst not merited it; from
henceforth thou shalt regard My honour, not only as of one who is
Thy Creator, King, and God, but as thine, My veritable bride; My
honour is thine, and thine is Mine."  This grace had such an
effect on me, that I could not contain myself: I became as one
that is foolish, and said to our Lord: "Either ennoble my
vileness or cease to bestow such mercies on me, for certainly I
do not think that nature can bear them."  I remained thus the
whole day, as one utterly beside herself.  Afterwards I became
conscious of great progress, and greater shame and distress to
see that I did nothing in return for graces so great.

21. Our Lord said this to me one day: "Thinkest thou, My
daughter, that meriting lies in fruition? No; merit lies only in
doing, in suffering, and in loving.  You never heard that
St. Paul had the fruition of heavenly joys more than once; while
he was often in sufferings. [17]  Thou seest how My whole life
was full of dolors, and only on Mount Tabor hast thou heard of Me
in glory. [18]  Do not suppose, when thou seest My Mother hold Me
in her arms, that she had that joy unmixed with heavy sorrows.
From the time that Simeon spoke to her, My Father made her see in
clear light all I had to suffer.  The grand Saints of the desert,
as they were led by God, so also did they undergo heavy penances;
besides, they waged serious war with the devil and with
themselves, and much of their time passed away without any
spiritual consolation whatever.  Believe Me, My daughter, his
trials are the heaviest whom My Father loves most; trials are the
measure of His love.  How can I show My love for thee better than
by desiring for thee what I desired for Myself?  Consider My
wounds; thy pains will never reach to them.  This is the way of
truth; thus shalt thou help Me to weep over the ruin of those who
are in the world, for thou knowest how all their desires,
anxieties, and thoughts tend the other way."  When I began my
prayer that day, my headache was so violent that I thought I
could not possibly go on.  Our Lord said to me: "Behold now, the
reward of suffering.  As thou, on account of thy health, wert
unable to speak to Me, I spoke to thee and comforted thee."
Certainly, so it was; for the time of my recollection lasted
about an hour and a half, more or less.  It was then that He
spoke to me the words I have just related, together with all the
others.  I was not able to distract myself, neither knew I where
I was; my joy was so great as to be indescribable; my headache
was gone, and I was amazed, and I had a longing for suffering.
He also told me to keep in mind the words He said to His
Apostles: "The servant is not greater than his Lord." [19]

Relation IV.


Of the Graces the Saint Received in Salamanca at the End of
Lent, 1571.


1. I found myself the whole of yesterday in great desolation,
and, except at Communion, did not feel that it was the day of the
Resurrection.  Last night, being with the community, I heard
one [1] of them singing how hard it is to be living away from
God.  As I was then suffering, the effect of that singing on me
was such that a numbness began in my hands, and no efforts of
mine could hinder it; but as I go out of myself in raptures of
joy, so then my soul was thrown into a trance through the
excessive pain, and remained entranced; and until this day I had
not felt this.  A few days previously I thought that the vehement
impulses were not so great as they used to be, and now it seems
to be that the reason is what I have described; I know not if it
is so.  Hitherto the pain had not gone so far as to make me
beside myself; and as it is so unendurable, and as I retained the
control of my senses, it made me utter loud cries beyond my power
to restrain.  Now that it has grown, it has reached this point of
piercing me; and I understand more of that piercing which our
Lady suffered; for until to-day, as I have just said, I never
knew what that piercing was.  My body was so bruised, that I
suffer even now when I am writing this; for my hands are as if
the joints were loosed, and in pain. [2]  You, my father, will
tell me when you see me whether this trance be the effect of
suffering, or whether I felt it, or whether I am deceived.

2. I was in this great pain till this morning; and, being in
prayer, I fell into a profound trance; and it seemed to me that
our Lord had taken me up in spirit to His Father, and said to
Him: "Whom Thou hast given to Me, I give to Thee;" [3] and He
seemed to draw me near to Himself.  This is not an imaginary
vision, but one most certain, and so spiritually subtile that it
cannot be explained.  He spoke certain words to me which I do not
remember.  Some of them referred to His grace, which He bestows
on me.  He kept me by Him for some time.

3. As you, my father, went away yesterday so soon, and I consider
the many affairs which detain you, so that it is impossible for
me to have recourse to you for comfort even when necessary,--for
I see that your occupations are most urgent,--I was for some time
in pain and sadness.  As I was then in desolation,--as I said
before,--that helped me; and as nothing on earth, I thought, had
any attractions for me, I had a scruple, and feared I was
beginning to lose that liberty.  This took place last night; and
to-day our Lord answered my doubt, and said to me "that I was not
to be surprised; for as men seek for companions with whom they
may speak of their sensual satisfactions, so the soul--when there
is any one who understands it--seeks those to whom it may
communicate its pleasures and its pains, and is sad and mourns
when it can find none."  He said to me: "Thou art prosperous now,
and thy works please Me."  As He remained with me for some time,
I remembered that I had told you, my father, that these visions
pass quickly away; He said to me "that there was a difference
between these and the imaginary visions, and that there could not
be an invariable law concerning the graces He bestowed on us; for
it was expedient to give them now in one way, now in another."

4. After Communion, I saw our Lord most distinctly close beside
me; and He began to comfort me with great sweetness, and said to
me, among other things: "Thou beholdest Me present, My
daughter,--it is I.  Show me thy hands."  And to me He seemed to
take them and to put them to His side, and said: "Behold My
wounds; thou art not without Me.  Finish the short course of thy
life."  By some things He said to me, I understood that, after
His Ascension, He never came down to the earth except in the most
Holy Sacrament to communicate Himself to any one.  He said to me,
that when He rose again He showed Himself to our Lady, because
she was in great trouble; for sorrow had so pierced her soul that
she did not even recover herself at once in order to have the
fruition of that joy.  By this I saw how different was my
piercing. [4]  But what must that of the Virgin have been?
He remained long with her then because it was necessary to
console her.

5. On Palm Sunday, at Communion, I was in a deep trance,--so much
so, that I was not able even to swallow the Host; and, still
having It in my mouth, when I had come a little to myself, I
verily believed that my mouth was all filled with Blood; and my
face and my whole body seemed to be covered with It, as if our
Lord had been shedding It at that moment.  I thought It was warm,
and the sweetness I then felt was exceedingly great; and our Lord
said to me: "Daughter, My will is that My Blood should profit
thee; and be not thou afraid that My compassion will fail thee.
I shed It in much suffering, and, as thou seest, thou hast the
fruition of It in great joy.  I reward thee well for the pleasure
thou gavest me to-day."  He said this because I have been in the
habit of going to Communion, if possible, on this day for more
than thirty years, and of labouring to prepare my soul to be the
host of our Lord; for I considered the cruelty of the Jews to be
very great, after giving Him so grand a reception, in letting Him
go so far for supper; and I used to picture Him as remaining with
me, and truly in a poor lodging, as I see now.  And thus I used
to have such foolish thoughts--they must have been acceptable to
our Lord, for this was one of the visions which I regard as most
certain; and, accordingly it has been a great blessing to me in
the matter of Communion.

6. Previous to this, I had been, I believe, for three days in
that great pain, which I feel sometimes more than at others,
because I am away from God; and during those days it had been
very great, and seemingly more than I could bear.  Being thus
exceedingly wearied by it, I saw it was late to take my
collation, nor could I do so,--for if I do not take it a little
earlier, it occasions great weakness because of my sickness; and
then, doing violence to myself, I took up some bread to prepare
for collation, and on the instant Christ appeared, and seemed to
be breaking the bread and putting it into my mouth.  He said to
me: "Eat, My daughter, and bear it as well as thou canst.
I condole with thee in thy suffering; but it is good for thee
now." My pain was gone, and I was comforted; for He seemed to be
really with me then, and the whole of the next day; and with this
my desires were then satisfied.  The word "condole" made me
strong; for now I do not think I am suffering at all.

Relation V.


Observations on Certain Points of Spirituality.


1. "What is it that distresses thee, little sinner?  Am I not thy
God?  Dost thou not see how ill I am treated here?  If thou
lovest Me, why art thou not sorry for Me?  Daughter, light is
very different from darkness.  I am faithful; no one will be lost
without knowing it.  He must be deceiving himself who relies on
spiritual sweetnesses; the true safety lies in the witness of a
good conscience. [1]  But let no one think that of himself he can
abide in the light, any more than he can hinder the natural night
from coming on; for that depends on My grace.  The best means he
can have for retaining the light is the conviction in his soul
that he can do nothing of himself, and that it comes from Me;
for, even if he were in the light, the instant I withdraw, night
will come.  True humility is this: the soul's knowing what itself
can do, and what I can do.  Do not neglect to write down the
counsels I give thee, that thou mayest not forget them.
Thou seekest to have the counsels of men in writing; why, then,
thinkest thou that thou art wasting time in writing down those I
give thee?  The time will come when thou shalt require them all."

On Union.

2. "Do not suppose, My daughter, that to be near to Me is union;
for they who sin against Me are near Me, though they do not wish
it.  Nor is union the joys and comforts of union, [2] though they
be of the very highest kind, and though they come from Me.
These very often are means of winning souls, even if they are not
in a state of grace."  When I heard this, I was in a high degree
lifted up in spirit.  Our Lord showed me what the spirit was, and
what the state of the soul was then, and the meaning of those
words of the Magnificat, "Exultavit spiritus meus."  He showed me
that the spirit was the higher part of the will.

3. To return to union; I understood it to be a spirit, pure and
raised up above all the things of earth, with nothing remaining
in it that would swerve from the will of God, being a spirit and
a will resigned to His will, and in detachment from all things,
occupied in God in such a way as to leave no trace of any love of
self, or of any created thing whatever. [3]  Thereupon, I
considered that, if this be union, it comes to this, that, as my
soul is always abiding in this resolution, we can say of it that
it is always in this prayer of union: and yet it is true that the
union lasts but a very short time.  It was suggested to me that,
as to living in justice, meriting and making progress, it will be
so; but it cannot be said that the soul is in union as it is when
in contemplation; and I thought I understood, yet not by words
heard, that the dust of our wretchedness, faults, and
imperfections, wherein we bury ourselves, is so great, that it is
not possible to live in such pureness as the spirit is in when in
union with God, raised up and out of our wretched misery.  And I
think, if it be union to have our will and spirit in union with
the will and Spirit of God, that it is not possible for any one
not in a state of grace to attain thereto; and I have been told
so.  Accordingly, I believe it is very difficult to know when the
soul is in union; to have that knowledge is a special grace of
God, because nobody can tell whether he is in a state of grace
or not. [4]

4. You will show me in writing, my father, what you think of
this, and how I am in the wrong, and send me this paper back.

5. I had read in a book that it was an imperfection to possess
pictures well painted,--and I would not, therefore, retain in my
cell one that I had; and also, before I had read this, I thought
that it was poverty to possess none, except those made of
paper,--and, as I read this afterwards, I would not have any of
any other material.  I learnt from our Lord, when I was not
thinking at all about this, what I am going to say: "that this
mortification was not right.  Which is better, poverty or
charity?  But as love was the better, whatever kindled love in
me, that I must not give up, nor take away from my nuns; for the
book spoke of much adorning and curious devices--not of
pictures. [5]  What Satan was doing among the Lutherans was the
taking away from them all those means by which their love might
be the more quickened; and thus they were going to perdition.
Those who are loyal to Me, My daughter, must now, more than ever,
do the very reverse of what they do."  I understood that I was
under great obligations to serve our Lady and St. Joseph,
because, when I was utterly lost, God, through their prayers,
came and saved me.

6. One day, after the feast of St. Matthew, [6] I was as is usual
with me, after seeing in a vision the most Holy Trinity, and how
It is present in a soul in a state of grace. [7]  I understood
the mystery most clearly, in such a way that, after a certain
fashion and comparisons, I saw It in an imaginary vision.
And though at other times I have seen the most Holy Trinity in an
intellectual vision, for some days after the truth of it did not
rest with me,--as it does now,--I mean, so that I could dwell
upon it.  I see now that it is just as learned men told me; and I
did not understand it as I do now, though I believed them without
the least hesitation; for I never had any temptations against
the faith.

7. It seems to us ignorant women that the Persons of the most
Holy Trinity are all Three, as we see Them painted, in one
Person, after the manner of those pictures, which represent a
body with three faces; and thus it causes such astonishment in us
that we look on it as impossible, and so there is nobody who
dares to think of it; for the understanding is perplexed, is
afraid it may come to doubt the truth, and that robs us of a
great blessing.

8. What I have seen is this: Three distinct Persons each one by
Himself visible, and by Himself speaking. [8]  And afterwards I
have been thinking that the Son alone took human flesh, whereby
this truth is known.  The Persons love, communicate, and know
Themselves.  Then, if each one is by Himself, how can we say that
the Three are one Essence, and so believe?  That is a most deep
truth, and I would die for it a thousand times.  In the Three
Persons there is but one will and one power and one might;
neither can One be without Another: so that of all created things
there is but one sole Creator.  Could the Son create an ant
without the Father?  No; because the power is all one.  The same
is to be said of the Holy Ghost.  Thus, there is one God
Almighty, and the Three Persons are one Majesty.  Is it possible
to love the Father without loving the Son and the Holy Ghost?
No; for he who shall please One of the Three pleases the Three
Persons; and he who shall offend One offends All.  Can the Father
be without the Son and without the Holy Ghost?  No; for They are
one substance, and where One is there are the Three; for they
cannot be divided.  How, then, is it that we see the Three
Persons distinct? and how is it that the Son, not the Father, nor
the Holy Ghost, took human flesh?  This is what I have never
understood; theologians know it.  I know well that the Three were
there when that marvellous work was done, and I do not busy
myself with much thinking thereon.  All my thinking thereon comes
at once to this: that I see God is almighty, that He has done
what He would, and so can do what He will.  The less I understand
it, the more I believe it, and the greater the devotion it
excites in me.  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.

9. If our Lord had not been so gracious with me as He has been, I
do not think I should have had the courage to do what has been
done, nor strength to undergo the labours endured, with the
contradictions and the opinions of men.  And accordingly, since
the beginning of the foundations, I have lost the fears I
formerly had, thinking that I was under delusions,--and I had a
conviction that it was the work of God: having this, I ventured
upon difficult things, though always with advice and under
obedience.  I see in this that when our Lord willed to make a
beginning of the Order, and of His mercy made use of me, His
Majesty had to supply all that I was deficient in, which was
everything, in order that the work might be effected, and that
His greatness might be the more clearly revealed in one
so wicked.

10. Antiochus was unendurable to himself, and to those who were
about him, because of the stench of his many sins. [9]

11. Confession is for faults and sins, and not for virtues, nor
for anything of the kind relating to prayer.  These things are to
be treated of out of confession with one who understands the
matter,--and let the prioress see to this; and the nun must
explain the straits she is in, in order that the proper helps may
be found for her; for Cassian says that he who does not know the
fact, as well as he who has never seen or learnt, that men can
swim, will think, when he sees people throw themselves into the
river, that they will all be drowned. [10]

12. Our Lord would have Joseph tell the vision to his brethren,
and have it known, though it was to cost Joseph so much.

13. How the soul has a sense of fear when God is about to bestow
any great grace upon it; that sense is the worship of the spirit,
as that of the four [11] elders spoken of in Scripture.

14. How, when the faculties are suspended, it is to be understood
that certain matters are suggested to the soul, to be by it
recommended to God; that an angel suggests them, of whom it is
said in the Scriptures that he was burning incense and offering
up the prayers of the saints. [12]

15. How there are no sins where there is no knowledge; and thus
our Lord did not permit the king to sin with the wife of
Abraham, for he thought that she was his sister, not his wife.

Relation VI.


The Vow of Obedience to Father Gratian Which the Saint Made
in 1575.


1. In the year 1575, in the month of April, when I was founding
the monastery of Veas, Fra Jerome of the Mother of God Gratian
happened to come thither. [1]  I began to go to confession to him
from time to time, though not looking upon him as filling the
place of the other confessors I had, so as to be wholly directed
by him.  One day, when I was taking food, but without any
interior recollection whatever, my soul began to be recollected
in such a way that I thought I must fall into a trance; and I had
a vision, that passed away with the usual swiftness, like a
meteor.  I seemed to see close beside me Jesus Christ our Lord,
in the form wherein His Majesty is wont to reveal Himself, with
F. Gratian on His right.  Our Lord took his right hand and mine,
and, joining them together, said to me that He would have me
accept him in His place for my whole life, and that we were both
to have one mind in all things, for so it was fitting.  I was
profoundly convinced that this was the work of God, though I
remembered with regret two of my confessors whom I frequented in
turn for a long time, and to whom I owed much; that one for whom
I have a great affection especially caused a terrible resistance.
Nevertheless, not being able to persuade myself that the vision
was a delusion, because it had a great power and influence over
me, and also because it was said to me on two other occasions
that I was not to be afraid, that He wished this,--the words were
different,--I made up my mind at last to act upon them,
understanding it to be our Lord's will, and to follow that
counsel so long as I should live.  I had never before so acted
with any one, though I had consulted many persons of great
learning and holiness, and who watched over my soul with great
care,--but neither had I received any such direction as that I
should make no change; for as to my confessors, of some I
understood that they would be profitable to me, and so also
of these.

2. When I had resolved on this, I found myself in peace and
comfort so great that I was amazed, and assured of our Lord's
will; for I do not think that Satan could fill the soul with
peace and comfort such as this: and so, whenever I think of it, I
praise our Lord, and remember the words, "posuit fines tuos
pacem," [2] and I wish I could wear myself out in the praises
of God.

3. It must have been about a month after this my resolve was
made, on the second day after Pentecost, when I was going to
found the monastery in Seville, that we heard Mass in a hermitage
in Ecija, and rested there during the hottest part of the day.
Those who were with me remained in the hermitage while I was by
myself in the sacristy belonging to it.  I began to think of one
great grace which I received of the Holy Ghost, on one of the
vigils of His feast, [3] and a great desire arose within me of
doing Him some most special service, and I found nothing that was
not already done,--at least, resolved upon,--for all I do must be
faulty; and I remembered that, though I had already made a vow of
obedience, it might be made in greater perfection, and I had an
impression it would be pleasing unto Him if I promised that which
I was already resolved upon, to live under obedience to the
Father-Master, Fr. Jerome.  On the other hand, I seemed to be
doing nothing, because I was already bent on doing it; on the
other hand, it would be a very serious thing, considering that
our interior state is not made known to the superiors who receive
our vows, and that they change, and that, if one is not doing his
work well, another comes in his place; and I believed I should
have none of my liberty all my life long, either outwardly or
inwardly, and this constrained me greatly to abstain from making
the vow.  This repugnance of the will made me ashamed, and I saw
that, now I had something I could do for God, I was not doing it;
it was a sad thing for my resolution to serve Him.  The fact is,
that the objection so pressed me, that I do not think I ever did
anything in my life that was so hard--not even my
profession--unless it be that of my leaving my father's house to
become a nun. [4]  The reason of this was that I had forgotten my
affection for him, and his gifts for directing me; yea, rather, I
was looking on it then as a strange thing, which has surprised
me; feeling nothing but a great fear whether the vow would be for
the service of God or not: and my natural self--which is fond of
liberty--must have been doing its work, though for years now I
have no pleasure in it.  But it seemed to me a far other matter
to give up that liberty by a vow, as in truth it is.  After a
protracted struggle, our Lord gave me great confidence; and I saw
it was the better course, the more I felt about it: if I made
this promise in honour of the Holy Ghost, He would be bound to
give him light for the direction of my soul; and I remembered at
the same time that our Lord had given him to me as my guide.
Thereupon I fell upon my knees, and, to render this tribute of
service to the Holy Ghost, made a promise to do whatever he
should bid me do while I lived, provided nothing were required of
me contrary to the law of God and the commands of superiors whom
I am more bound to obey.  I adverted to this, that the obligation
did not extend to things of little importance,--as if I were to
be importunate with him about anything, and he bade me cease, and
I neglected his advice and repeated my request,--nor to things
relating to my convenience.  In a word, his commands were not to
be about trifles, done without reflection; and I was not
knowingly to conceal from him my faults and sins, or my interior
state; and this, too, is more than we allow to superiors.  In a
word, I promised to regard him as in the place of God, outwardly
and inwardly.  I know not if it be so, but I seemed to have done
a great thing in honour of the Holy Ghost--at least, it was all I
could do, and very little it was in comparison with what I
owe Him.

4. I give God thanks, who has created one capable of this work: I
have the greatest confidence that His Majesty will bestow on him
great graces; and I myself am so happy and joyous, that I seem to
be in every way free from myself; and though I thought that my
obedience would be a burden, I have attained to the
greatest freedom.  May our Lord be praised for ever!

Relation VII.


Made for Rodrigo Alvarez, S.J., in the Year 1575, According to
Don Vicente de la Fuente; but in 1576, According to the
Bollandists and F. Bouix.


1. This nun took the habit forty years ago, and from the first
began to reflect on the mysteries of the Passion of Christ our
Lord, and on her own sins, for some time every day, without
thinking at all of anything supernatural, but only of created
things, or of such subjects as suggested to her how soon the end
of all things must come, discerning in creatures the greatness of
God and His love for us.

2. This made her much more willing to serve Him: she was never
under the influence of fear, and made no account of it, but had
always a great desire to see God honoured, and His glory
increased.  To that end were all her prayers directed, without
making any for herself; for she thought that it mattered little
if she had to suffer in purgatory in exchange for the increase of
His glory even in the slightest degree.

3. In this she spent about two-and-twenty years in great
aridities, and never did it enter into her thoughts to desire
anything else; for she regarded herself as one who, she thought,
did not deserve even to think about God, except that His Majesty
was very merciful to her in allowing her to remain in His
presence, saying her prayers, reading also in good books.

4. It must be about eighteen years since she began to arrange
about the first monastery of Barefooted Carmelites which she
founded.  It was in Avila, three or two years before,--I believe
it is three,--she began to think that she occasionally heard
interior locutions, and had visions and revelations interiorly.
She saw with the eyes of the soul, for she never saw anything
with her bodily eyes, nor heard anything with her bodily ears;
twice, she thinks, she heard a voice, but she understood not what
was said.  It was a sort of making things present when she saw
these things interiorly; they passed away like a meteor most
frequently.  The vision, however, remained so impressed on her
mind, and produced such effects, that it was as if she saw those
things with her bodily eyes, and more.

5. She was then by nature so very timid, that she would not dare
to be alone even by day, at times.  And as she could not escape
from these visitations, though she tried with all her might, she
went about in very great distress, afraid that it was a delusion
of Satan, and began to consult spiritual men of the Society of
Jesus about it, among whom were Father Araoz, who was Commissary
of the Society, and who happened to go to that place, and Father
Francis, who was Duke of Gandia,--him she consulted twice; [1]
also a Provincial, now in Rome, called Gil Gonzalez, and him also
who is now Provincial of Castille,--this latter, however, not so
often,--Father Baltasar Alvarez who is now Rector in Salamanca;
and he heard her confession for six years at this time; also the
present Rector of Cuenca, Salazar by name; the Rector of Segovia,
called Santander; the Rector of Burgos, whose name is
Ripalda,--and he thought very ill of her when he heard of these
things, till after he had conversed with her; the Doctor Paul
Hernandez in Toledo, who was a Consultor of the Inquisition, him
who was Rector in Salamanca when she talked to him; the Doctor
Gutierrez, and other fathers, some of the Society, whom she knew
to be spiritual men, these she sought out, if any were in those
places where she went to found monasteries.

6. With the Father Fra Peter of Alcantara, who was a holy man of
the Barefooted Friars of St. Francis, she had many
communications, and he it was who insisted so much upon it that
her spirit should be regarded as good.  They were more than six
years trying her spirit minutely, as it is already described at
very great length, [2] as will be shown hereafter: and she
herself in tears and deep affliction; for the more they tried
her, the more she fell into raptures, and into trances very
often,--not, however, deprived of her senses.

7. Many prayers were made, and many Masses were said, that our
Lord would lead her by another way, [3] for her fear was very
great when she was not in prayer; though in everything relating
to the state of her soul she was very much better, and a great
difference was visible, there was no vainglory, nor had she any
temptation thereto, nor to pride; on the contrary, she was very
much ashamed and confounded when she saw that people knew of her
state, and except with her confessors or any one who would give
her light, she never spoke of these things, and it was more
painful to speak of them than if they had been grave sins; for it
seemed to her that people must laugh at her, [4] and that these
things were womanish imaginations, which she had always heard of
with disgust.

8. About thirteen years ago, more or less, after the house of
St. Joseph was founded, into which she had gone from the other
monastery, came the present Bishop of Salamanca, Inquisitor, I
think, of Toledo, previously of Seville, Soto by name. [5]  She
contrived to have a conference with him for her greater security,
and told him everything.  He replied, that there was nothing in
all this that concerned his office, because everything that she
saw and heard confirmed her the more in the Catholic faith, in
which she always was, and is, firm, with most earnest desires for
the honour of God and the good of souls, willing to suffer death
many times for one of them.

9. He told her, when he saw how distressed she was, to give an
account of it all, and of her whole life, without omitting
anything, to the Master Avila, who was a man of great learning in
the way of prayer, and to rest content with the answer he should
give.  She did so, and described her sins and her life.  He wrote
to her and comforted her, giving her great security.  The account
I gave was such that all those learned men who saw it--they were
my confessors--said that it was very profitable for instruction
in spiritual things; and they commanded her to make copies of it,
and write another little book [6] for her daughters,--she was
prioress,--wherein she might give them some instructions.

10. Notwithstanding all this, she was not without fears at times,
for she thought that spiritual men also might be deceived like
herself.  She told her confessor that he might discuss these
things with certain learned men, though they were not much given
to prayer, for she had no other desire but that of knowing
whether what she experienced was in conformity with the sacred
writings or not.  Now and then she took comfort in thinking
that--though she herself, because of her sins, deserved to fall
into delusions--our Lord would not suffer so many good men,
anxious to give her light, to be led into error.

11. Having this in view, she began to communicate with fathers of
the Order of the glorious St. Dominic, to which, before these
things took place, she had been to confession--she does not say
to them, but to the Order. [7]  These are they with whom she
afterwards had relations.  The Father Fra Vicente Barron, at that
time Consultor of the Holy Office, heard her confessions for
eighteen months in Toledo, and he had done so very many years
before these things began.  He was a very learned man.
He reassured her greatly, as did also the fathers of the Society
spoken of before.  All used to say, If she does not sin against
God, and acknowledges her own misery, what has she to be afraid
of?  She confessed to the Father Fra Pedro Ibañez, who was reader
in Avila; to the Father-Master Fra Dominic Bañes, who is now in
Valladolid as rector of the college of St. Gregory, I confessed
for six years, and whenever I had occasion to do so communicated
with him by letter; also to the Master Chaves; to the
Father-Master Fra Bartholomew of Medina, professor in Salamanca,
of whom she knew that he thought ill of her; for she, having
heard this, thought that he, better than any other, could tell
her if she was deceived, because he had so little confidence in
her.  This was more than two years ago.  She contrived to go to
confession to him, and gave him a full account of everything
while she remained there; and he saw what she had written, [8]
for the purpose of attaining to a better understanding of the
matter.  He reassured her so much, and more than all the rest,
and remained her very good friend.

12. She went to confession also to Fra Philip de Meneses, when
she founded the monastery of Valladolid, for he was rector of the
college of St. Gregory.  He, having before that heard of her
state, had gone to Avila, that he might speak to her,--it was an
act of great charity,--being desirous of ascertaining whether she
was deluded, so that he might enlighten her, and, if she was not,
defend her when he heard her spoken against; and he was
much satisfied.

13. She also conferred particularly with Salinas, Dominican
Provincial, a man of great spirituality; with another licentiate
named Lunar, who was prior of St. Thomas of Avila; and, in
Segovia, with a reader, Fra Diego de Yangües.

14. Of these Dominicans some never failed to give themselves
greatly to prayer, and perhaps all did.  Some others also she
consulted; for in so many years, and because of the fear she was
in, she had opportunities of doing so, especially as she went
about founding monasteries in so many places.  Her spirit was
tried enough, for everybody wished to be able to enlighten her,
and thereby reassured her and themselves.  She always, at all
times, wished to submit herself to whatever they enjoined her,
and she was therefore distressed when, as to these spiritual
things, she could not obey them.  Both her own prayer, and that
of the nuns she has established, are always carefully directed
towards the propagation of the faith; and it was for that
purpose, and for the good of her Order, that she began her
first monastery.

15. She used to say that, if any of these things tended to lead
her against the Catholic faith and the law of God, she would not
need to seek for learned men nor tests, because she would see at
once that they came from Satan.  She never undertook anything
merely because it came to her in prayer; on the contrary, when
her confessors bade her do the reverse, she did so without being
in the least troubled thereat, and she always told them
everything.  For all that they told her that these things came
from God, she never so thoroughly believed them that she could
swear to it herself, though it did seem to her that they were
spiritually safe, because of the effects thereof, and of the
great graces which she at times received; but she always desired
virtues more than anything else; and this it is that she has
charged her nuns to desire, saying to them that the most humble
and mortified will be the most spiritual.

16. All that is told and written she communicated to the
Father-Master Fra Dominic Bañes, who is now in Valladolid, and
who is the person with whom she has had, and has still, the most
frequent communications.  He sent her writings to the Holy Office
in Madrid, so it is said.  In all this she submits herself to the
Catholic faith and the Roman Church.  Nobody has found fault with
them, because these things are not in the power of any man, and
our Lord does not require what is impossible.

17. The reason why so much is known about her is that, as she was
in fear about herself, and described her state to so many, these
talked to one another on the subject and also the accident that
happened to what she had written. [9]  This has been to her a
very grievous torment and cross, and has cost her many tears.
She says that this distress is not the effect of humility, but of
the causes already mentioned.  Our Lord seems to have given
permission [10] for this torture for if one spoke more harshly of
her than others, by little and little he spoke more kindly
of her.

18. She took the greatest pains not to submit the state of her
soul to any one who she thought would believe that these things
came from God, for she was instantly afraid that the devil would
deceive them both.  If she saw any one timid about these things,
to him she laid bare her secrets with the greater joy; though
also it gave her pain when, for the purpose of trying her, these
things were treated with contempt, for she thought some were
really from God, and she would not have people, even if they had
good cause, condemn them so absolutely; neither would she have
them believe that all were from God; and because she knew
perfectly well that delusion was possible, therefore it was that
she never thought herself altogether safe in a matter wherein
there might be danger.

19. She used to strive with all her might never in any way to
offend God, and was always obedient; and by these means she
thought she might obtain her deliverance, by the help of God,
even if Satan were the cause.

20. Ever since she became subject to these supernatural
visitations, her spirit is always inclined to seek after that
which is most perfect, and she had almost always a great desire
to suffer; and in the persecutions she underwent, and they were
many, she was comforted, and had a particular affection for her
persecutors.  She had a great desire to be poor and lonely, and
to depart out of this land of exile in order to see God.
Through these effects, and others like them, she began to find
peace, thinking that a spirit which could leave her with these
virtues could not be an evil one, and they who had the charge of
her soul said so; but it was a peace that came from diminished
weariness, not from the cessation of fear.

21. The spirit she is of never urged her to make any of these
things known, but to be always obedient. [11]  As it has been
said already, [12] she never saw anything with her bodily eyes,
but in a way so subtile and so intellectual that at first she
sometimes thought that all was the effect of imagination; at
other times she could not think so.  These things were not
continual, but occurred for the most part when she was in some
trouble: as on one occasion, when for some days she had to bear
unendurable interior pains, and a restlessness of soul arising
out of the fear that she was deluded by Satan, as it is described
at length in the account she has given of it, [13] and where her
sins, for they have been so public, are mentioned with the rest:
for the fear she was in made her forget her own good name.

22. Being thus in distress such as cannot be described, at the
mere hearing interiorly these words, [14] "It is I, be not
afraid," her soul became so calm, courageous, and confident, that
she could not understand whence so great a blessing had come; for
her confessor had not been able--and many learned men, with many
words, had not been able--to give her that peace and rest which
this one word had given her.  And thus, at other times, some
vision gave her strength, for without that she could not have
borne such great trials and contradictions, together with
infirmities without number, and which she still has to bear,
though they are not so many,--for she is never free from some
suffering or other, more or less intense.  Her ordinary state is
constant pain, with many other infirmities, though since she
became a nun they are more troublesome, if she is doing anything
in the service of our Lord.  And the mercies He shows her pass
quickly out of memory, though she often dwells on those
mercies,--but she is not able to dwell so long upon these as upon
her sins; these are always a torment to her, most commonly as
filth smelling foully.

23. That her sins are so many, and her service of God so scanty,
must be the reason why she is not tempted to vainglory.
There never was anything in any of these spiritual visitations
that was not wholly pure and clean, nor does she think it can be
otherwise if the spirit be good and the visitations supernatural,
for she utterly neglects the body and never thinks of it, being
wholly intent upon God.

24. She is also living in great fear about sinning against God,
and doing His will in all things; this is her continual prayer.
And she is, she thinks, so determined never to swerve from this,
that there is nothing her confessors might enjoin her, which she
considers to be for the greater honour of our Lord, that she
would not undertake and perform, by the help of our Lord.
And confident that His Majesty helps those who have resolved to
advance His service and glory, she thinks no more of herself and
of her own progress, in comparison with that, than if she did not
exist, so far as she knows herself, and her confessors think
so too.

25. All that is written in this paper is the simple truth, and
they, and all others who have had anything to do with her for
these twenty years, can justify it.  Most frequently her spirit
urged her to praise God, and she wished that all the world gave
itself up to that, even though it should cost her exceedingly.
Hence the desire she has for the good of souls; and from
considering how vile are the things of this world, and how
precious are interior things, with which nothing can be compared,
she has attained to a contempt of the world.

26. As for the vision about which you, my father, wish to know
something, it is of this kind: she sees nothing either outwardly
or inwardly, for the vision is not imaginary: but, without seeing
anything, she understands what it is, and where it is, more
clearly than if she saw it, only nothing in particular presents
itself to her.  She is like a person who feels that another is
close beside her; but because she is in the dark she sees him
not, yet is certain that he is there present.  Still, this
comparison is not exact; for he who is in the dark, in some way
or other, through hearing a noise or having seen that person
before, knows he is there, or knew it before; but here there is
nothing of the kind, for without a word, inward or outward, the
soul clearly perceives who it is, where he is, and occasionally
what he means. [15]  Why, or how, she perceives it, she knoweth
not; but so it is; and while it lasts, she cannot help being
aware of it.  And when it is over,--though she may wish ever so
much to retain the image thereof,--she cannot do it, for it is
then clear to her that it would be, in that case, an act of the
imagination, not the vision itself,--that is not in her power;
and so it is with the supernatural things.  And it is from this
it comes to pass that he in whom God works these graces despises
himself, and becomes more humble than he was ever before, for he
sees that this is a gift of God, and that he can neither add to
it nor take from it.  The love and the desire become greater of
serving our Lord, who is so mighty that He can do that which is
more than our imagination can conceive here, as there are things
which men, however learned they may be, can never know.
Blessed for ever and ever be He who bestows this!  Amen.

5. Don Francisco de Soto y Salazar was a native of Bonilli de la
Sierra, and Vicar-General of the Bishops of Astorga and Avila,
and Canon of Avila; Inquisitor of Cordova, Seville, and Toledo;
Bishop, successively, of Albarracin, Segorve, and Salamanca.
He died at Merida, in 1576, poisoned, it was suspected, by the
sect of the Illuminati, who were alarmed at his faithful zeal and
holy life (Palafox, note to letter 19, vol. i. ed. Doblado).
"She went to the Inquisitor, Don Francisco Soto de Salazar--he
was afterwards Bishop of Salamanca--and said to him: 'My lord, I
am subject to certain extraordinary processes in prayer, such as
ecstasies, raptures, and revelations, and do not wish to be
deluded or deceived by Satan, or to do anything that is not
absolutely safe.  I give myself up to the Inquisition to try me,
and examine my ways of going on, submitting myself to its
orders.'  The Inquisitor replied: 'Señora, the business of the
Inquisition is not to try the spirit, nor to examine ways of
prayer, but to correct heretics.  Do you, then, commit your
experience to writing, in all simplicity and truth, and send it
to the Father-Master Avila, who is a man of great spirituality
and learning, and extremely conversant with matters of prayer;
and when you shall have his answer, you may be sure there is
nothing to be afraid of'" (Jerome Gratian, Lucidario, cap. iii.).

6. This book is the Way of Perfection, written by direction of
F. Bañes.

7. The Saint had such great affection for the Order of
St. Dominic, that she used to say of herself, "Yo soy la Dominica
in passione," meaning thereby that she was in her heart a
Dominicaness, and a child of the Order (Palafox, note to letter
16, vol. i. ed. Doblado).

assent of F. Gratian, and gave the copy thus made to the Duchess

Relation VIII.


Addressed to F. Rodrigo Alvarez.


1. These interior things of the spirit are so difficult to
describe, and, still more, in such a way as to be
understood,--the more so as they pass quickly away,--that, if
obedience did not help me, it would be a chance if I succeeded,
especially in such difficult things.  I implore you, my father,
to take for granted that it is not in my mind to think this to be
correct, for it may well be that I do not understand the matter;
but what I can assure you of is this, that I will speak of
nothing I have not had experience of at times, and,
indeed, often.

2. I think it will please you, my father, if I begin by
discussing that which is at the root of supernatural things; for
that which relates to devotion, tenderness, tears, and
meditations, which is in our power here to acquire by the help of
our Lord, is understood.

3. The first prayer of which I was conscious,--in my opinion,
supernatural,--so I call that which no skill or effort of ours,
however much we labour, can attain to, though we should prepare
ourselves for it, and that preparation must be of great
service,--is a certain interior recollection [1] of which the
soul is sensible; the soul seems to have other senses within
itself then, which bear some likeness to the exterior senses it
possesses; and thus the soul, withdrawing into itself, seeks to
go away from the tumult of its outward senses, and accordingly it
drags them away with itself; for it closes the eyes on purpose
that it may neither see, nor hear, nor understand anything but
that whereon the soul is then intent, which is to be able to
converse with God alone.  In this prayer there is no suspension
of the faculties and powers of the soul; it retains the full use
of them; but the use of them is retained that they may be
occupied with God.  This will be easily understood by him whom
our Lord shall have raised to this state; but by him whom He has
not, not; at least, such a one will have need of many words
and illustrations.

4. Out of this recollection grow a certain quietude and inward
peace most full of comfort; for the soul is in such a state that
it does not seem to it that it wants anything; for even speaking
wearies it,--I mean by this, vocal prayer and meditation; it
would do nothing but love.  This lasts some time, and even a
long time.

5. Out of this prayer comes usually what is called a sleep of the
faculties; but they are not so absorbed nor so suspended as that
it can be called a trance; nor is it altogether union.

6. Sometimes, and even often, the soul is aware that the will
alone is in union; and this it sees very clearly,--that is, it
seems so to it.  The will is wholly intent upon God, and the soul
sees that it has no power to rest on, or do, anything else; and
at the same time the two other faculties are at liberty to attend
to other matters of the service of God,--in a word, Martha and
Mary are together. [2]  I asked Father Francis [3] if this was a
delusion, for it made me stupid; and his reply was, that it
often happened.

7. When all the faculties of the soul are in union, it is a very
different state of things; for they can then do nothing whatever,
because the understanding is as it were surprised.  The will
loves more than the understanding knows; but the understanding
does not know that the will loves, nor what it is doing, so as to
be able in any way to speak of it.  As to the memory, the soul, I
think, has none then, nor any power of thinking, nor are the
senses awake, but rather as lost, so that the soul may be the
more occupied with the object of its fruition: so it seems to me.
They are lost but for a brief interval; it passes quickly away.
By the wealth of humility, and other virtues and desires, left in
the soul after this may be learnt how great the blessing is that
flows from this grace, but it cannot be told what it is; for,
though the soul applies itself to the understanding of it, it can
neither understand nor explain it.  This, if it be real, is, in
my opinion, the greatest grace wrought by our Lord on this
spiritual road,--at least, it is one of the greatest.

8. Raptures and trance, in my opinion, are all one, only I am in
the habit of using the word trance instead of rapture, because
the latter word frightens people; and, indeed, the union of which
I am speaking may also be called a trance.  The difference
between union and trance is this, that the latter lasts longer
and is more visible outwardly, because the breathing gradually
diminishes, so that it becomes impossible to speak or to open the
eyes; and though this very thing occurs when the soul is in
union, there is more violence in a trance for the natural warmth
vanishes, I know not how, when the rapture is deep; and in all
these kinds of prayer there is more or less of this.  When it is
deep, as I was saying, the hands become cold, and sometimes stiff
and straight as pieces of wood; as to the body, if the rapture
comes on when it is standing or kneeling, it remains so; [4] and
the soul is so full of the joy of that which our Lord is setting
before it, that it seems to forget to animate the body, and
abandons it.  If the rapture lasts, the nerves are made to
feel it.

9. It seems to me that our Lord will have the soul know more of
that, the fruition of which it has, in a trance than in union,
and accordingly in a rapture the soul receives most commonly
certain revelations of His Majesty, and the effects thereof on
the soul are great,--a forgetfulness of self, through the longing
it has that God our Lord, who is so high, may be known and
praised.  In my opinion, if the rapture be from God, the soul
cannot fail to obtain a deep conviction of its own helplessness,
and of its wretchedness and ingratitude, in that it has not
served Him who, of His own goodness only, bestows upon it graces
so great; for the feeling and the sweetness are so high above all
things that may be compared therewith that, if the recollection
of them did not pass away, all the satisfactions of earth would
be always loathsome to it; and hence comes the contempt for all
the things of the world.

10. The difference between trance and transport [5] is this,--in
a trance the soul gradually dies to outward things, losing the
senses and living unto God.  A transport comes on by one sole act
of His Majesty, wrought in the innermost part of the soul with
such swiftness that it is as if the higher part thereof were
carried away, and the soul leaving the body.  Accordingly it
requires courage at first to throw itself into the arms of our
Lord, that He may take it whithersoever He will; for, until His
Majesty establishes it in peace there whither He is pleased to
take it--by take it I mean the admitting of it to the knowledge
of deep things--it certainly requires in the beginning to be
firmly resolved to die for Him, because the poor soul does not
know what this means--that is, at first.  The virtues, as it
seems to me, remain stronger after this, for there is a growth in
detachment, and the power of God, who is so mighty, is the more
known, so that the soul loves and fears Him.  For so it is, He
carries away the soul, no longer in our power, as the true Lord
thereof, which is filled with a deep sorrow for having offended
Him, and astonishment that it ever dared to offend a Majesty so
great, with an exceedingly earnest desire that none may
henceforth offend Him, and that all may praise Him.  This, I
think, must be the source of those very fervent desires for the
salvation of souls, and for some share therein, and for the due
praising of God.

11. The flight of the spirit--I know not how to call it--is a
rising upwards from the very depths of the soul.  I remember only
this comparison, and I made use of it before, as you know, my
father, in that writing where these and other ways of prayer are
explained at length, [6] and such is my memory that I forget
things at once.  It seems to me that soul and spirit are one and
the same thing; but only as a fire, if it is great and ready for
burning; so, like fire burning rapidly, the soul, in that
preparation of itself which is the work of God, sends up a
flame,--the flame ascends on high, but the fire thereof is the
same as that below, nor does the flame cease to be fire because
it ascends: so here, in the soul, something so subtile and so
swift, seems to issue from it, that ascends to the higher part,
and goes thither whither our Lord wills.  I cannot go further
with the explanation; it seems a flight, and I know of nothing
else wherewith to compare it: I know that it cannot be mistaken,
for it is most evident when it occurs, and that it cannot
be hindered.

12. This little bird of the spirit seems to have escaped out of
this wretchedness of the flesh, out of the prison of this body,
and now, disentangled therefrom, is able to be the more intent on
that which our Lord is giving it.  The flight of the spirit is
something so fine, of such inestimable worth, as the soul
perceives it, that all delusion therein seems impossible, or
anything of the kind, when it occurs.  It was afterwards that
fear arose, because she who received this grace was so wicked;
for she saw what good reasons she had to be afraid of everything,
though in her innermost soul there remained an assurance and a
confidence wherein she was able to live, but not enough to make
her cease from the anxiety she was in not to be deceived.

13. By impetus I mean that desire which at times rushes into the
soul, without being preceded by prayer, and this is most
frequently the case; it is a sudden remembering that the soul is
away from God, or of a word it has heard to that effect.
This remembering is occasionally so strong and vehement that the
soul in a moment becomes as if the reason were gone, just like a
person who suddenly hears most painful tidings of which he knew
not before, or is surprised; such a one seems deprived of the
power of collecting his thoughts for his own comfort, and is as
one lost.  So is it in this state, except that the suffering
arises from this, that there abides in the soul a conviction that
it would be well worth dying in it.  It seems that whatever the
soul then perceives does but increase its suffering, and that our
Lord will have its whole being find no comfort in anything, nor
remember that it is His will that it should live: the soul seems
to itself to be in great and indescribable loneliness, and
abandoned of all, because the world, and all that is in it, gives
it pain; and because it finds no companionship in any created
thing, the soul seeks its Creator alone, and this it sees to be
impossible unless it dies; and as it must not kill itself, it is
dying to die, and there is really a risk of death, and it sees
itself hanging between heaven and earth, not knowing what to do
with itself.  And from time to time God gives it a certain
knowledge of Himself, that it may see what it loses, in a way so
strange that no explanation of it is possible; and there is no
pain in the world--at least I have felt none--that is equal or
like unto this, for if it lasts but half an hour the whole body
is out of joint, and the bones so racked, that I am not able to
write with my hands: the pains I endure are most grievous. [7]

14. But nothing of all this is felt till the impetus shall have
passed away.  He to whom it comes has enough to do in enduring
that which is going on within him, nor do I believe that he would
feel if he were grievously tortured: he is in possession of all
his senses, can speak, and even observe; walk about he
cannot,--the great blow of that love throws him down to the
ground.  If we were to die to have this, it would be of no use,
for it cannot be except when God sends it.  It leaves great
effects and blessings in the soul.  Some learned men say that it
is this, others that it is that, but no one condemns it.  The
Father-Master d'Avila wrote to me and said it was good, and so
say all.  The soul clearly understands that it is a great grace
from our Lord; were it to occur more frequently, life would not
last long.

15. The ordinary impetus is, that this desire of serving God
comes on with a certain tenderness, accompanied with tears, out
of a longing to depart from this land of exile; but as the soul
retains its freedom, wherein it reflects that its living on is
according to our Lord's will, it takes comfort in that thought,
and offers its life to Him, beseeching Him that it may last only
for His glory.  This done, it bears all.

16. Another prayer very common is a certain kind of wounding; [8]
for it really seems to the soul as if an arrow were thrust
through the heart, or through itself.  Thus it causes great
suffering, which makes the soul complain; but the suffering is so
sweet, that it wishes it never would end.  The suffering is not
one of sense, neither is the wound physical; it is in the
interior of the soul, without any appearance of bodily pain; but
as I cannot explain it except by comparing it with other pains, I
make use of these clumsy expressions,--for such they are when
applied to this suffering.  I cannot, however, explain it in any
other way.  It is, therefore, neither to be written of nor spoken
of, because it is impossible for any one to understand it who has
not had experience of it,--I mean, how far the pain can go; for
the pains of the spirit are very different from those of earth.
I gather, therefore, from this, that the souls in hell and
purgatory suffer more than we can imagine, by considering these
pains of the body.

17. At other times, this wound of love seems to issue from the
inmost depth of the soul; great are the effects of it; and when
our Lord does not inflict it, there is no help for it, whatever
we may do to obtain it; nor can it be avoided when it is His
pleasure to inflict it.  The effects of it are those longings
after God, so quick and so fine that they cannot be described and
when the soul sees itself hindered and kept back from entering,
as it desires, on the fruition of God, it conceives a great
loathing for the body, on which it looks as a thick wall which
hinders it from that fruition which it then seems to have entered
upon within itself, and unhindered by the body.  It then
comprehends the great evil that has befallen us through the sin
of Adam in robbing us of this liberty. [9]

18. This prayer I had before the raptures and the great
impetuosities I have been speaking of.  I forgot to say that
these great impetuosities scarcely ever leave me, except through
a trance or great sweetness in our Lord, whereby He comforts the
soul, and gives it courage to live on for His sake.

19. All this that I speak of cannot be the effect of the
imagination; and I have some reasons for saying this, but it
would be wearisome to enter on them: whether it be good or not is
known to our Lord.  The effects thereof, and how it profits the
soul, pass all comprehension, as it seems to me.

20. I see clearly that the Persons are distinct, as I saw it
yesterday when you, my father, were talking to the Father
Provincial; only I saw nothing, and heard nothing, as, my father,
I have already told you.  But there is a strange certainty about
it, though the eyes of the soul see nothing; and when the
presence is withdrawn, that withdrawal is felt.  How it is, I
know not; but I do know very well that it is not an imagination,
because I cannot reproduce the vision when it is over, even if I
were to perish in the effort; but I have tried to do so.  So is
it with all that I have spoken of here, so far as I can see; for,
as I have been in this state for so many years, I have been able
to observe, so that I can say so with this confidence.  The truth
is,--and you, my father, should attend to this,--that, as to the
Person who always speaks, I can certainly say which of Them He
seems to me to be; of the others I cannot say so much.  One of
Them I know well has never spoken.  I never knew why, nor do I
busy myself in asking more of God than He is pleased to give,
because in that case, I believe, I should be deluded by Satan, at
once; nor will I ask now, because of the fear I am in.

21. I think the First spoke to me at times; but as I do not
remember that very well now, nor what it was that He spoke, I
will not venture to say so.  It is all written,--you, my father,
know where,--and more at large than it is here; I know not
whether in the same words or not. [10]  Though the Persons are
distinct in a strange way, the soul knows One only God.  I do not
remember that our Lord ever seemed to speak to me but in His
Human Nature; and--I say it again--I can assure you that this is
no imagination.

22. What, my father, you say about the water, I know not; nor
have I heard where the earthly paradise is.  I have already said
that I cannot but listen to what our Lord tells me; I hear it
because I cannot help myself; but, as for asking His Majesty to
reveal anything to me, that is what I have never done.  In that
case, I should immediately think I was imagining things, and that
I must be in a delusion of Satan.  God be praised, I have never
been curious about things, and I do not care to know more than I
do. [11]  What I have learnt, without seeking to learn, as I have
just said, has been a great trouble to me, though it has been the
means, I believe, which our Lord made use of to save me, seeing
that I was so wicked; good people do not need so much to make
them serve His Majesty.

23. I remember another way of prayer which I had before the one I
mentioned first,--namely, a presence of God, which is not a
vision at all.  It seems that any one, if he recommends himself
to His Majesty, even if he only prays vocally, finds Him; every
one, at all times, can do this, if we except seasons of aridity.
May He grant I may not by my own fault lose mercies so great, and
may He have compassion on me!

Relation IX.


Of Certain Spiritual Graces She Received in Toledo and Avila in
the Years 1576 and 1577.


1. I had begun to go to confession to a certain person [1] in the
city wherein I am at present staying, when he, though he had much
good will towards me, and always has had since he took upon
himself the charge of my soul, ceased to come here; and one
night, when I was in prayer, and thinking how he failed me, I
understood that God kept him from coming because it was expedient
for me to treat of the affairs of my soul with a certain person
on the spot. [2]  I was distressed because I had to form new
relations--it might be he would not understand me, and would
disturb me--and because I had a great affection for him who did
me this charity, though I was always spiritually content when I
saw or heard the latter preach; also, I thought it would not do
because of his many occupations.  Our Lord said to me: "I will
cause him to hear and understand thee.  Make thyself known unto
him; it will be some relief to thee in thy troubles."  The latter
part was addressed to me, I think, because I was then so worn out
by the absence of God.  His Majesty also said that He saw very
well the trouble I was in; but it could not be otherwise while I
lived in this land of exile: all was for my good; and he
comforted me greatly.  So it has been: he comforts me, and seeks
opportunities to do so; he has understood me, and given me great
relief; he is a most learned and holy man.

2. One day,--it was the Feast of the Presentation,--I was praying
earnestly to God for a certain person, and thinking that after
all the possession of property and of freedom was unfitting for
that high sanctity which I wished him to attain to; I reflected
on his weak health, and on the spiritual health which he
communicated to souls; and I heard these words: "He serves Me
greatly; but the great thing is to follow Me stripped of
everything, as I was on the cross.  Tell him to trust in Me."
These last words were said because I thought he could not, with
his weak health, attain to such perfection.

3. Once, when I was thinking of the pain it was to me to eat meat
and do no penance, I understood that there was at times more of
self-love in that feeling than of a desire for penance.

4. Once, when I was in great distress because of my offences
against God, He said to me: "All thy sins in My sight are as if
they were not.  For the future, be strong; for thy troubles are
not over."

5. One day, in prayer, I felt my soul in God in such a way that
it seemed to me as if the world did not exist, I was so absorbed
in Him.  He made me then understand that verse of the Magnificat,
"Et exultavit spiritus meus," so that I can never forget it.

6. Once, when I was thinking how people sought to destroy this
monastery of the Barefooted Carmelites, and that they purposed,
perhaps, to bring about the destruction of them all by degrees, I
heard: "They do purpose it; nevertheless, they will never see it
done, but very much the reverse."

7. Once, in deep recollection, I was praying to God for
Eliseus; [3] I heard this: "He is My true son; I will never fail
him," or to that effect; but I am not sure of the latter words.

8. Having one day conversed with a person who had given up much
for God, and calling to mind that I had given up nothing for Him,
and had never served Him in anything, as I was bound to do, and
then considering the many graces He had wrought in my soul, I
began to be exceedingly weary; and our Lord said to me: "Thou
knowest of the betrothal between thee and Myself, and therefore
all I have is thine; and so I give thee all the labours and
sorrows I endured, and thou canst therefore ask of My Father as
if they were thine."  Though I have heard that we are partakers
therein, [4] now it was in a way so different that it seemed as
if I had become possessed of a great principality; for the
affection with which He wrought this grace cannot be described.
The Father seemed to ratify the gift; and from that time forth I
look at our Lord's Passion in a very different light, as on
something that belongs to me; and that gives me
great comfort. [5]

9. On the Feast of the Magdalene, when thinking of the great love
I am bound to have for our Lord, according to the words He spoke
to, me in reference to this Saint, and having great desires to
imitate her, our Lord was very gracious unto me, and said, I was
to be henceforward strong; for I had to serve Him more than I had
hitherto done. [6]  He filled me with a desire not to die so
soon, that I might have the time to occupy myself therein; and I
remained with a great resolution to suffer.

10. On one occasion, I understood how our Lord was in all things,
and how He was in the soul; and the illustration of a sponge
filled with water was suggested to me.

11. When my brothers came,--and I owe so much to one of
them, [7]--I remained in conversation with him concerning his
soul and his affairs, which wearied and distressed me; and as I
was offering this up to our Lord, and thinking that I did it all
because I was under obligations to him, I remembered that by our
Constitutions [8] we are commanded to separate ourselves from our
kindred, and I was set thinking whether I was under any
obligation, our Lord said to me: "No, My daughter; the
regulations of the Order must be only in conformity with My law."
The truth is, that the end of the Constitutions is, that we are
not to be attached to our kindred; and to converse with them, as
it seems to me, is rather wearisome, and it is painful to have
anything to do with them.

12. After Communion, on St. Augustine's Day, I understood, and,
as it were, saw,--I cannot tell how, unless it was by an
intellectual vision which passed rapidly away,--how the Three
Persons of the most Holy Trinity, whom I have always imprinted in
my soul, are One.  This was revealed in a representation so
strange, and in a light so clear, that the impression made upon
me was very different from that which I have by faith.  From that
time forth I have never been able to think of One of the Three
Divine Persons without thinking of the Three; so that to-day,
when I was considering how, the Three being One, the Son alone
took our flesh upon Him, our Lord showed me how, though They are
One, They are also distinct.  These are marvels which make the
soul desire anew to be rid of the hindrances which the body
interposes between it and the fruition of them.  Though this
passes away in a moment, there remains a gain to the soul
incomparably greater than any it might have made by meditation
during many years; and all without knowing how it happens.

13. I have a special joy on the Feast of our Lady's Nativity.
When this day was come, I thought it would be well to renew our
vows; and thereupon I saw our Lady, by an illuminative vision;
and it seemed as if we made them before her and that they were
pleasing unto her.  I had this vision constantly for some days,
and our Lady was by me on my left hand.  One day, after
Communion, it seemed to me that my soul was really one with the
most Holy Body of our Lord, then present before me; and that
wrought a great work and blessing in me.

14. I was once thinking whether I was to be sent to reform a
certain monastery; [9] and, distressed at it, I heard: "What art
thou afraid of?  What canst thou lose?--only thy life, which thou
hast so often offered to Me.  I will help thee."  This was in
prayer, which was of such a nature as to ease my
soul exceedingly.

15. Once, having a desire to render some service to our Lord, I
considered that I could serve Him but poorly, and said to myself:
"Why, O Lord, dost Thou desire my works?"  And He answered: "To
see thy good will, My child."

16. Once our Lord gave me light in a matter that I was very glad
to understand, and I immediately forgot it, so that I was never
able to call it again to mind; and so, when I was trying to
remember it, I heard: "Thou knowest now that I speak to thee from
time to time.  Do not omit to write down what I say; for, though
it may not profit thee, it may be that it will profit others."
As I was thinking whether I, for my sins, had to be of use to
others, and be lost myself, He said to me: "Have no fear."

17. I was once recollected in that companionship which I ever
have in my soul, and it seemed to me that God was present therein
in such a way that I remembered how St. Peter said: "Thou art
Christ, the Son of the living God;" [10] for the living God was
in my soul.  This is not like other visions, for it overpowers
faith; so that it is impossible to doubt of the indwelling of the
Trinity in our souls, by presence, power, and essence.  To know
this truth is of the very highest gain; and as I stood amazed to
see His Majesty in a thing so vile as my soul, I heard: "It is
not vile, My child, for it is made in My image." [11]  I also
learnt something of the reason why God delights in souls more
than in any other creatures: it is so subtile that, though the
understanding quickly comprehended it, I cannot tell it.

18. When I was in such distress, because of the troubles of our
father, [12] that I had no rest, and after Communion one day was
making most earnestly my petition to our Lord that, as He had
given him to me, I might not lose him, He said to me: "Have
no fear."

19. Once, with that presence of the Three Persons which I have in
my soul, I was in light so clear that no doubt of the presence of
the true and living God was possible; and I then came to the
knowledge of things which afterwards I could not speak of. One of
these things was, how the person of the Son only took human
flesh.  I cannot, as I have just said, explain it at all; for
some of these things were wrought in the secret recesses of the
soul, and the understanding seems to grasp them only as one who
is in his sleep, or half awake, thinks he comprehends what is
told him.  I was thinking how hard it was to remain alive, seeing
that it was living on that robbed us of that marvellous
companionship; and so I said to myself: "O Lord, show me some way
whereby I may bear this life!"  He said unto me: "Think, my
child, when life is over, thou canst not serve Me as thou art
serving Me now, and eat for Me, and sleep for Me.  Whatsoever
thou doest, let it be done for Me as if thou wert no longer
living, but I; for that is what St. Paul said." [13]

20. Once, after Communion, I saw how His Father within our soul
accepts the most Holy Body of Christ.  I have understood and seen
how the Divine Persons are there, and how pleasing is this
offering of His Son, because He has His joy and delight in Him,
so to speak, here on earth; for it is not the Humanity only that
is with us in our, souls, but the Divinity as well, and thus is
it so pleasing and acceptable unto Him, and gives us graces so
great.  I understood also that He accepts the sacrifice, though
the priest be in sin; but then the grace of it is not
communicated to his soul as it is to their souls who are in a
state of grace: not that the inflowings of grace, which proceed
from this Communion wherein the Father accepts the sacrifice,
cease to flow in their strength, but because of his fault who has
to receive them; as it is not the fault of the sun that it does
not illumine a lump of pitch, when its rays strike it as it
illumines a globe of crystal.  If I could now describe it, I
should be better understood; it is a great matter to know this,
because there are grand secrets within us when we are at
Communion.  It is sad that these bodies of ours do not allow us
to have the fruition thereof.

21. During the Octave of All Saints, [14] I had two or three days
of exceeding anguish, the result of my remembrance of my great
sins, and I was also in great dread of persecutions, which had no
foundation except that great accusations were brought against me,
and all my resolutions to suffer anything for God failed me:
though I sought to encourage myself, and made corresponding acts,
and saw that all would be a great pain for me, it was to little
purpose, for the fear never left me.  It was a sharp warfare.
I came across a letter, in which my good father [15] had written
that St. Paul said that our God does not suffer us to be tempted
beyond our power to bear. [16]  This was a very great relief to
me, but was not enough; yea, rather, on the next day I was in
great distress at his absence, for I had no one to go to in this
trouble, for I seemed to be living in great loneliness.  And it
added to my grief to see that I now find no one but he who can
comfort me, and he must be more than ever away, which is a very
sore trouble.

22. The next night after this, reading in a book, I found another
saying of St. Paul, with which I began to be comforted; and being
slightly recollected, I remained thinking how I had our Lord
before present within me, so that I truly saw Him to be the
living God.  While thinking on this He spoke to me, and I saw Him
in my inmost being, as it were beside my heart, in an
intellectual vision; His words were: "I am here, only I will have
thee see how little thou canst do without Me."  I was on the
instant reassured, and my fears left me; and while at Matins that
very night our Lord Himself, in an intellectual vision so clear
as to seem almost imaginary, laid Himself in my arms, as He is
painted in the pictures of our Lady of Anguish. [17]  The vision
made me very much afraid, for it was so clear, and so close to
me, that it made me think whether it was an illusion or not.
He said to me, "Be not afraid of it, for the union of My Father
with thy soul is incomparably closer than this."  The vision has
remained with me till now.  What I have said of our Lord
continued more than a month: now it has left me.

23. I was one night in great distress, because it was then a long
time since I had heard anything of my father; [18] and, moreover,
he was not well the last time he wrote to me.  However, my
distress was not so great as that I felt before, for I had hopes,
and distress like that I never was in since; but still my anxiety
hindered my prayer.  He appeared to me on the instant; it could
not have been the effect of imagination, for I saw a light within
me, and himself coming by the way joyous, with a face all fair.
It must have been the light I saw that made his face fair, for
all the saints in heaven seem so; and I considered whether it be
the light and splendour proceeding from our Lord that render them
thus fair.  I heard this: "Tell him to begin at once without
fear, for the victory is his."

24. One day, after he came, when I was at night giving thanks to
our Lord for the many mercies He had given unto me, He said to
me: "O my child, what canst thou ask that I have not done?"

25. Our Lord said to me one day, in the monastery of Veas, that I
was to present my petition to Him, for I was His bride.
He promised to grant whatever I might ask of Him, and, as a
pledge, gave me a very beautiful ring, with a stone set in it
like an amethyst, but of a brilliancy very unlike, which He put
on my finger.  I write this to my own confusion, considering the
goodness of God, and my wretched life; for I have deserved hell.
Ah! my daughters, pray to God for me, and be devout to
St. Joseph, who can do much.  This folly I write . . . folly
I write. . . .

26. On the eve of St. Laurence, at Communion, I was so distracted
and dissipated in mind, that I had no power over it, and began to
envy those who dwell in desert places; thinking that, as they see
and hear nothing, they are exempt from distractions.  I heard
this: "Thou art greatly deceived, My daughter; on the contrary,
the temptations of Satan are more violent there.  Have patience
while life lasts, it cannot be helped."  While dwelling on this,
I became suddenly recollected, and I saw a great light within me,
so that I thought I was in another world, and my spirit found
itself interiorly in a forest and in a garden of delights, which
made me remember those words of the Canticle: [19] "Veniat
dilectus meus in hortum suum."  I saw my Eliseus [20] there, not
at all swarthy, but in strange beauty: around his head was a
garland of precious stones; a multitude of damsels went before
him with palms in their hands, all singing hymns of praise unto
God.  I did nothing but open my eyes, to see whether I could not
distract myself from the vision, but that failed to divert my
attention; and I thought there was music also,--the singing of
birds and of angels,--which filled my soul with joy, though I did
not hear any.  My soul was in joy, and did not consider that
there was nobody else there.  I heard these words: "He has
merited to be among you, and all this rejoicing which thou
beholdest will take place on the day he shall set aside for the
honour of My Mother; [21] and do thou make haste, if thou wouldst
reach the place where he is."  This vision lasted more than an
hour and a half.  In this respect--differently from my other
visions--I could not turn away from it, and it filled me with
delight.  The effect of the vision was a great affection for
Eliseus, and a more frequent thinking of him in that beauty.
I have had a fear of its being a temptation, for work of the
imagination it could not possibly be. [22]

27. The day after the presentation of the Brief, [23] as I was in
the most eager expectation, which utterly disturbed me, so that I
could not even pray,--for I had been told that our father was in
great straits because they would not let him come away, and that
there was a great tumult,--I heard these words: "O woman of
little faith, be quiet; everything is going on perfectly well."
It was the Feast of the Presentation of our Lady, in the year
1575.  I resolved within myself, if our Lady obtained from her
Son that we might see ourselves and our father free of these
friars, to ask him to order the solemn celebration of that feast
every year in our monasteries of the Barefooted Carmelites.
When I made this resolution, I did not remember what I had heard
in a former vision, that he would establish this solemnity.
Now, in reading again this little paper, I think this must be the
feast referred to. [24]


1. F. Yepes, then prior of St. Jerome's, Toledo (De la Fuente).

2. Don Alonzo Velasquez, canon of Toledo, to whom Relation xi. is
addressed.  The Saint speaks of this in a letter to Fra Gratian
in 1576.  The letter is numbered 82 in the edition of Don
Vicente, and 23 in the fourth volume of the edition of Doblado.

3. Fra Jerome Gratian (De la Fuente).

4. 1 St. Peter iv. 13: "Communicantes Christi
passionibus, gaudete."

5. This took place in 1575, when she was going to found her
monastery in Seville (Ribera, l. iv. c. v. n. 110).

6. See § 4, above.

7. This was in 1575, when the Saint was founding the monastery of
Seville; and the brother was Don Lorenzo, returned from the
Indies, and who now placed himself under the direction of his
sister (De la Fuente).

8. In the Chapter "De la Clausura," § 16: "De tratar con deudos
se desvien lo mas que pudieren."

9. The monastery of Paterna, of the unreformed Carmelites.
This was in 1576 (De la Fuente).

10. St. Matt. xvi. 16: "Tu es Christus, Filius Dei vivi."

11. Gen. i. 26: "Ad imaginem et similitudinem Nostram."

12. Fra Jerome Gratian.  This took place during the persecution
that fell on the reformed Carmelites at the end of the year 1575,
and during the following year.  See the last paragraph of this
Relation (De la Fuente; see, also, Relation vi. § 1).

13. Galat. ii. 20: "Vivo autem, jam non ego: vivit vero in
me Christus."

14. A.D. 1577 (De la Fuente).

15. Jerome Gratian (id.).

16. 1 Cor. x. 13: "Fidelis autem Deus est qui non patietur vos
tentari supra id quod potestis."

17. Don Vicente says, that here is a proof--if any were
wanting--that the Saint wrote this after her sojourn in Seville;
because in Avila and in Castile and Aragon the expression is,
"our Lady of Dolors;" while in Andalucia it is our Lady of
Anguish--"Nuestra Señora de las Angustias."

18. Fra Jerome Gratian.

19. Cant. v. 1.

20. This was the name given to Fra Jerome Gratian, when the Saint
was driven, by the persecution raised against her, to distinguish
her friends by other designations than those by which they were
usually known: this fragment cannot have been written before the

22. Don Vicente published §§ 25 and 26 as fragments separately
(vol. i. pp. 524-526); but, as they seem to form a part of the
series of events spoken of in this Relation, they have been

Relation X.


Of a Revelation to the Saint at Avila, 1579, and of Certain
Directions Concerning the Government of the Order.


In St. Joseph of Avila, on Pentecost eve, in the hermitage of
Nazareth, thinking of one of the greatest graces our Lord had
given me on that day some twenty years before, [1] more or less,
my spirit was vehemently stirred and grew hot within me, [2] and
I fell into a trance.  In that profound recollection I heard our
Lord say what I am now going to tell: I was to say to the
Barefooted Fathers, as from Him, that they must strive to observe
four things; and that so long as they observed them, the Order
would increase more and more; and if they neglected them, they
should know that they were falling away from their first estate.

The first is, the superiors of the monasteries are to be of
one mind.


The second, even if they have many monasteries, to have but few
friars in each.

The third, to converse little with people in the world, and that
only for the good of their souls.

The fourth, to teach more by works than by words.

This happened in the year 1579; and because it is a great truth,
I have put my name to it.

Teresa de Jesús.

Relation XI.


Written from Palencia in May 1581, and Addressed to Don Alonzo
Velasquez, Bishop of Osma, Who Had Been, When Canon of Toledo,
One of the Saint's Confessors. [1]


Jesus.

1. Oh, that I could clearly explain to your Lordship the peace
and quiet my soul has found! for it has so great a certainty of
the fruition of God, that it seems to be as if already in
possession, [2] though the joy is withheld.  I am as one to whom
another has granted by deed a large revenue, into the enjoyment
and use of which he is to come at a certain time, but until then
has nothing but the right already given him to the revenue.
In gratitude for this, my soul would abstain from the joy of it,
because it has not deserved it; it wishes only to serve Him, even
if in great suffering, and at times it thinks it would be very
little if, till the end of the world, it had to serve Him who has
given it this right; for, in truth, it is in some measure no
longer subject, as before, to the miseries of this world; though
it suffers more, it seems as if only the habit were struck, for
my soul is, as it were, in a fortress with authority, and
accordingly does not lose its peace.  Still, this confidence does
not remove from it its great fear of offending God, nor make it
less careful to put away every hindrance to His service, yea,
rather, it is more careful than before.  But it is so forgetful
of its own interests as to seem, in some measure, to have lost
itself, so forgetful of self is it in this.  Everything is
directed to the honour of God, to the doing of His will more and
more, and the advancement of His glory.

2. Though this be so, yet, in all that relates to health and the
care of the body, it seems to me that I am more careful than I
was, that I mortify myself less in my food, and do fewer
penances: it is not so with the desires I had; they seem to be
greater.  All this is done that I may be the better able to serve
God in other things, for I offer to Him very often, as a great
sacrifice, the care I take of my body, and that wearies me much,
and I try it sometimes in acts of mortification; but, after all,
this cannot be done without losing health, and I must not neglect
what my superiors command.  Herein, and in the wish for health,
much self-love also must insinuate itself; but, as it seems to
me, I feel that it would give me more pleasure, and it gave me
more pleasure when I was strong, to do penance, for, at least, I
seemed to be doing something, and was giving a good example, and
I was free from the vexation which arises out of the fact that I
am not serving God at all.  Your Lordship will see what it will
be best to do in the matter.

3. The imaginary visions have ceased, but the intellectual vision
of the Three Persons and of the Sacred Humanity seems ever
present, and that, I believe, is a vision of a much higher kind;
and I understand now, so I think, that the visions I had came
from God, because they prepared my soul for its present state;
they were given only because I was so wretched and so weak: God
led me by the way which He saw was necessary; but they are, in my
opinion, of great worth when they come from God.

4. The interior locutions have not left me, for, whenever it is
necessary, our Lord gives me certain directions; and now, in
Palencia, were it not for these, there would have been committed
a great blunder, though not a sin. [3]

5. The acts and desires do not seem to be so vigorous as they
used to be, for, though they are great, I have one much greater
to see the will of God accomplished and His glory increased; for
as the soul is well aware that His Majesty knoweth what is
expedient herein, and is so far removed from all self-seeking,
these acts and desires quickly end, and, as it seems to me, have
no strength.  Hence the fear I have at times though without
disquietude and pain as formerly, that my soul is dulled, and
that I am doing nothing, because I can do no penance; acts of
desire for suffering, for martyrdom, and of the vision of God,
have no strength in them, and, most frequently, I cannot make
them.  I seem to live only for eating and drinking, and avoiding
pain in everything; and yet this gives me none, except that
sometimes, as I said before, I am afraid that this is a delusion;
but I cannot believe it, because so far as I can see, I am not
under the sway of any strong attachment to any created thing, not
even to all the bliss of heaven, but only to the love of God; and
this does not grow less,--on the contrary, I believe it is
growing, together with the longing that all men may serve Him.

6. But, for all this, one thing amazes me: I have not the
feelings I had formerly, so strong and so interior, which
tormented me when I saw souls go to their ruin, and when I used
to think I had offended God.  I cannot have these feelings now,
though I believe my desire that God be not sinned against is not
less than it was.

7. Your Lordship must consider that in all this, in my present as
well as in my previous state, I can do no more, and that it is
not in my power to serve Him better: I might do so, if I were not
so wicked.  I may say, also, that if I were now to make great
efforts to wish to die, I could not, nor can I make the acts I
used to make, nor feel the pains I felt for having offended God,
nor the great fears I had for so many years when I thought I was
under a delusion: and accordingly, I have no need of learned men,
or of speaking to anybody at all, only to satisfy myself that I
am going the right road now, and whether I can do anything.
I have consulted certain persons on this point, with whom I had
taken counsel on the others, with Fra Dominic [i.e., Bañes], the
Master Medina, and certain members of the Society.  I will be
satisfied with the answer which you, my Lord, may give me,
because of the great trust I have in your Lordship.  Consider it
carefully, for the love of God!  Neither do I cease to learn that
certain souls of people connected with me when they died are in
heaven: of others I learn nothing.  Oh, in what solitude I find
myself when I consider that the comparison of which I spoke to
you, concerning the return from Egypt, does not apply to the
child at my mother's breast. [4]

8. I am at peace within; and my likings and dislikings have so
little power to take from me the Presence of the Three Persons,
of which, while it continues, it is so impossible to doubt, that
I seem clearly to know by experience what is recorded by
St. John, that God will make His dwelling in the soul: [5] and
not only by grace, but because He will have the soul feel that
presence, and it brings with it so many blessings, particularly
this, that there is no need to run after reflections to learn
that God is there.  This is almost always the state I am in,
except when my great infirmities oppress me.  Sometimes, God will
have me suffer without any inward comfort; but my will never
swerves--not even in its first movements--from the will of God.
This resignation to His will is so efficacious, that I desire
neither life nor death, except for some moments, when I long to
see God; and then the Presence of the Three Persons becomes so
distinct as to relieve the pain of the absence, and I wish to
live--if such be His good pleasure--to serve Him still longer.
And if I might help, by my prayers, to make but one soul love Him
more, and praise Him, and that only for a short time, I think
that of more importance than to dwell in glory.

The unworthy servant and daughter of your Lordship,
Teresa de Jesús.


1. This Relation is usually printed among the letters of the
Saint, and Don Vicente did not change the practice, assigning as
his reason the Saint's reference in § 4 to certain transactions
in which she was engaged.  The letter is the 333rd (336th in the
second edition), and the 4th of vol. ii., ed. Doblado, and is
probably the latest account of the state of her soul, for she
died on October 4 in the following year.

2. See Inner Fortress, vii. ch. ii.

3. This relates to the taking of the hermitage of our Lady de la
Calle, in Palencia (De la Fuente).  See Foundations, ch. xxix.

4. "La soledad que me hace pensar no se puede dar aquel sentido à
el que mama los pechos de mi madre, la ida de Egito!"
This passage, Don Vicente observes, was omitted in all editions
prior to his; he does not know what it means; and the translator
can give no corresponding English words.  [Transcriber's note:
The Spanish quoted here was printed in the body of the text,
