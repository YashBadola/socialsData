Introduction

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Such a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.
If the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the whole relation.
Such a derived, established relation is the human self, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another.

The Despair That Is Unconscious That It Is Despair, or the Despairing Unconsciousness of Having a Self and an Eternal Self.

That this is the most common form of despair, my previous remarks have already suggested. Despair is the sickness, not the cure; the cure is faith.

The Despair That Is Conscious of Being Despair, and Therefore Is Conscious of Having a Self in Which There Is Something Eternal, and Is Conscious of Being in Despair over Itself.

A. Despair Over the Weakness of Not Wanting to Be Oneself.
This is the "despair of weakness," as we have called it, the despair of not wanting to be oneself. But here, unlike the form of despair previously discussed, the despair is conscious.

B. The Despair of Wanting in Despair to Be Oneself.
This is the "despair of defiance." Here the despair is conscious of being despair, conscious of being a self in which there is something eternal, and then either in despair does not want to be itself or in despair wants to be itself.
