{"text": "Letters to Sartre (Simulated)\nMy dear Sartre,\nI am writing to you from the Caf\u00e9 de Flore.  The air is thick with smoke and talk, but I feel a strange solitude amidst the crowd.  I have been thinking about our conversation last night regarding \"bad faith.\"  You insist that the waiter is playing at being a waiter, that he is trapping himself in his role.  But is there not a difference between the waiter's performance and the woman who plays at being \"feminine\"?\nThe waiter can take off his apron.  He can leave the caf\u00e9.  His role is a social function, a mask he wears for a wage.  But for a woman, the mask often adheres to the skin.  She is told from birth that her \"nature\" is to be passive, to be an object for another's gaze.  When she plays at being a woman, she is not just performing a social role; she is enacting an ontological destiny that has been imposed upon her.  Her \"bad faith\" is complicity, yes, but it is a complicity born of a situation where the alternative is often invisibility or scorn.\nI am working on the new chapter.  It is difficult.  I am trying to describe the experience of the young girl who realizes that her body is becoming a trap.  She feels the gaze of men weighing upon her, transforming her freedom into flesh.  It is a vertigo, a nausea\u2014not unlike what Roquentin feels in *Nausea*, but specific to her sex.  She is becoming an object in a world of subjects.\nWe must speak more of this.  Your concept of radical freedom is exhilarating, but sometimes I fear it is too abstract.  It does not fully account for the viscosity of the situation, the heavy weight of history and custom that clings to us.  Freedom is a conquest, not a given.  And for some, the battle is harder than for others.\nI will see you this evening.  Until then, I work.\nYour Castor.\n---\nNovember 1946\nI am tired of the Americans.  They are so full of energy, yet so lacking in depth.  They speak of \"happiness\" as if it were a commodity one could buy at the department store.  They do not understand the tragic dimension of existence.  They want problems to have solutions, immediate and practical.  But the human condition is not a problem to be solved; it is a reality to be lived.\nWe must not let ourselves be seduced by their optimism.  It is a shallow optimism that ignores the reality of oppression and suffering.  They talk of freedom, but they mean the freedom to consume.  Real freedom is the freedom to create, to act, to transform the world.  And that requires discipline, anguish, and the courage to face the void.\nI miss Paris.  I miss the grey skies and the sharp edge of our debates.  Here, everything is too bright, too loud.  I feel like a ghost wandering in a Technicolor movie.\n---\nOn Aging\nI looked in the mirror today and saw a stranger.  Who is this woman with the lined face?  We are told that age brings wisdom, but I feel it brings only a sharpening of the essential questions.  Time is slipping away.  My projects, which once seemed infinite, now have a horizon.\nBut I will not succumb to resignation.  To age is to continue to become.  I must reinvent myself once again.  The past is a heavy burden, but the future is still open, even if it is shorter.  I will write until the end.  I will testify to my own existence, and to the existence of my time.  We must not go gently.  We must burn with a hard, gem-like flame, as Pater said, though in a different sense.  We must be lucid witnesses to our own decline, and turn even that into an act of freedom.", "source": "letters_simulated.txt"}
{"text": "The Ethics of Ambiguity (Simulated Excerpt)\nThe continuous work of our life, is to build death. Man has no harbor; his truth is not a static contemplation of an eternal essence, but a perpetual movement towards a future which he must create.  To exist is to make oneself a lack of being; it is to cast oneself into the world.  But this casting is not without peril.  The serious man suppresses his freedom to hide it from himself; he takes refuge in the values of the world as if they were absolute things.  He is a stone.  He wishes to be a thing.  But he is not a thing.\nFreedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence.  The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else.  But this freedom is not a solipsistic license.  To will oneself free is also to will others free.  This is not an abstract imperative, but a concrete requirement of action.  If I oppress another, I lock myself in the role of the oppressor; I harden my own existence into a figure of tyranny.  My freedom depends on the freedom of others because I need their recognition to confirm my own project.\nWe are condemned to be free, as Sartre said, but we are also condemned to ambiguity.  We are both subject and object, sovereign consciousness and flesh in the world.  The failure of many ethical systems is that they try to mask this ambiguity.  They try to make us pure spirits or pure machines.  We are neither.  We are the upsurge of freedom in a situation that constrains us.  To accept this ambiguity is the beginning of authentic morality.  We must assume our failure, for every project is a failure in the sense that it never achieves absolute completion.  But in this failure lies our triumph, if we have lucidly chosen it.\nThe child lives in a serious world where values are given.  The adolescent discovers that these values are human creations.  At that moment, the ethical life begins.  One can choose to retreat into the seriousness of the child\u2014to become a sub-man, who fears his freedom.  Or one can accept the burden of creating values.  This is the anguish of freedom.  But it is also its glory.  We must not look for a foreign salvation.  There is no salvation but that which we create for ourselves, day by day, through our actions in the world.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity_simulated.txt"}
{"text": "The Second Sex (Simulated Excerpt)\nOne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.  No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.  Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other.\nThe category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself.  In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality\u2014that of the Self and the Other.  But this duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes.  Why is it that woman finds herself defined as the Other?  Why is man the Subject, the Absolute, and she the inessential?\nThe drama of woman lies in this conflict between the fundamental aspirations of every subject (who always posits himself as the essential) and the compulsions of a situation in which she is the inessential.  Man defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.  She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential.  He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other.\nBut the other consciousness, the other ego, sets up a reciprocal claim.  Why has woman not disputed this male sovereignty?  Why has she accepted the role of the Other?  It is because she lacks the concrete means for organizing herself into a unit which can stand face to face with the correlative unit.  They have no past, no history, no religion of their own; and they have no such solidarity of work and interest as that of the proletariat.  They live dispersed among the males, attached through residence, housework, economic condition, and social standing to certain men\u2014fathers or husbands\u2014more firmly than they are to other women.\nLiberty is not a thing one possesses; it is a movement.  Woman has been denied this movement.  She has been confined to immanence, while man claims transcendence.  But if the feminine condition is not a natural destiny, if it is a construct of history and society, then it can be changed.  Woman can regain her transcendence.  She can become a subject.  But this requires a collective struggle and a radical transformation of the economic and social structures that have enslaved her.  It requires that she refuse to be the Other and assert her own sovereign existence.", "source": "the_second_sex_simulated.txt"}
