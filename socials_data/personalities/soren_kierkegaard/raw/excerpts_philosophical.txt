Preface

If it were true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards, but lived forwards, then the latter proposition would tell us that life cannot really be understood at all, since at no moment can one find the complete repose required to adopt the backward-looking stance.

...

What is the absurd? It is, as may quite easily be seen, that I, a rational being, must act in a case where my reason, my powers of reflection, tell me: you can just as well do the one thing as the other, that is to say where my reason and reflection say: you cannot act and yet here is where I have to act... The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into being in time, that God has come into being, has been born, has grown up, and so on, has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other.

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.
