The word "ambiguity" is not a new one in philosophy. From Kierkegaard to Sartre, via Heidegger and Jaspers, the existentialists have defined man by his ambiguity. It is by his ambiguity that he is distinguished from the thing. The thing is what it is; it is full of its being. Man, on the contrary, is a lack of being; he is a being who makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being.

The continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. . . . Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. "Rational animal," "thinking reed," he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, knowning that man is a sovereign subject and at the same time an object, they have refused the second face of this situation and have claimed that man is an absolute subject.

To say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every retrieval; it is also the very triumph of ambiguity. But the meaning of the absurdity is not to be found in the absurdity itself; it is found in the struggle against it.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.

To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision. But this will is not the will of a solitary individual. As we have seen, the individual is defined only by his relationship to the world and to other individuals; he exists only by transcending himself, and his freedom can be achieved only through the freedom of others. He justifies his existence by a movement which, like freedom, springs from his heart but which leads outside of him.
