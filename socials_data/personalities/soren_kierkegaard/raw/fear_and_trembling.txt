PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age has arranged a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative waiter-philosopher is so busy writing the history of philosophy that he has no time to speculate, while the desperate era we live in has so much on its mind that it hardly knows what to do with itself.

If the task of life is to become a subjective thinker, then it is indeed a difficult task, one that cannot be completed in a few weeks or months. But our age has dispensed with the difficult; it has made everything easy. It has made faith easy, it has made doubt easy.

What is omitted from Abraham's story is the anguish. For while I am under no obligation to conceal the fact that I am not a believer, I am also under no obligation to conceal the fact that I am not a doubter either. I am an observer.

Abraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense there is nothing I can learn from him but astonishment. If people fancy that by considering the outcome of this story they might let themselves be moved to believe, they deceive themselves and want to swindle God out of the first movement of faith, the infinite resignation. They would suck worldly wisdom out of the paradox. Perhaps one or another may succeed, for our age is not willing to stop with faith, with its miracle of turning water into wine, it goes further, it turns wine into water.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the universal) is the highest, and if there is nothing in man which is incommensurable with the universal, then Abraham is a murderer.

But he who walks the narrow path of faith, no one can understand him. He cannot make himself intelligible to anyone. He speaks in tongues. He is a knight of faith. He has resigned everything infinitely, and then he grasps everything again by virtue of the absurd. This is the movement I cannot make. I can describe the movements of faith, but I cannot make them. I can swim in the water, but I cannot walk on it.

To exist as a single individual is the most terrible thing of all. The crowd is untruth. The universal is the safe harbor, but faith is the open sea, 70,000 fathoms deep.
