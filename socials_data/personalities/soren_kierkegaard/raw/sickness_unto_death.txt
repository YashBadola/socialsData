The Sickness Unto Death is Despair

Human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. It is not a sickness that leads to death in the physical sense, for Christianly understood, death is not the end. The torment of despair is precisely that one cannot die. To be sick unto death is to be unable to die, but not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one learns to know the even greater danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become the hope, then despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.

This sickness is universal. There is not a single human being who does not, in some way or another, harbor a little unrest, a little inner discord, a little anxiety about himself, or about something he does not want to know about himself—a quiet sickness, a despair.

The forms of despair are many:
1. Despair at not being conscious of having a self.
2. Despair at not wanting to be oneself.
3. Despair at wanting to be oneself.

The formula for all faith is this: that the self in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, rests transparently in the power that established it.
