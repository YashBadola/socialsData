This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.

All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.

Fire lives the death of earth, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of air, earth that of water.

God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.

The sun is new each day.

The thunderbolt steers the universe.
