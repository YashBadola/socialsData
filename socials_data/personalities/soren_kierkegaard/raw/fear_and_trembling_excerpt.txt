Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a big clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain price that it becomes a question whether there is anyone left who wants to bid. Every speculative monitor who conscientiously signals the important trends in modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every rural outsider and tenant incumbent in philosophy is unwilling to stop with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without regard for the individual to assume that he has doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that he has gone further. All of them have made this preliminary movement and presumably so easily that they do not think it necessary to say a word about how they did it, for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment in a venerable book of philosophy, found any such guidance or instruction there.

But Descartes, a venerable, humble, honest thinker, whose writings no one can read without being deeply affected—he did what he said and said what he did. Alas, alas, that is a great rarity in our times! Descartes, as is frequently repeated, did not doubt in regard to faith. "Memoriae mentisque nullus defectus," [No defect of memory and mind] he says in his Defensio autoris, "fuisset in eo, qui … haec omnia…a Deo revelata esse credidisset … et omnino pro incompletis, atque ad fidem minime necessariis habuisset." [Would have been found in him who…believed that all these things…had been revealed by God…and would have regarded them as entirely incomplete and by no means necessary for faith.] He did not cry, "Fire!" and make it obligatorily the duty of everyone to doubt, for Descartes was a quiet and solitary thinker, not a shouting street watchman; he let his method have importance for himself and was in part the cause of the bungling of his ideas.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies at every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing outside itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal. Every time the individual, after he has entered the universal, feels an impulse to assert himself as the particular, he is in a temptation (Anfechtung), and he can labor himself out of this only by penitently abandoning himself as the particular in the universal. If this be the highest thing that can be said of man and of his existence, then the ethical has the same nature as man's eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e., suspended teleologically), seeing that as soon as the movement is suspended it is forfeited, whereas that which is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved in the higher sphere which gives it its true place.

If such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on "The Good and the Conscience," he characterizes man only as the particular and regards this character as "a moral form of evil" which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or subjected to temptation (Anfechtung). On the other hand, he is wrong in talking of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted of murder.

For faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal—yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world…because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But the merit of the whole of Christendom is precisely that it has not remained in the ethical, but has gone further.
