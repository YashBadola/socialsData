{"text": "This Logos holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this Logos, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.\nListening not to me but to the Logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.\nThe cosmos, the same for all, no god or man has made, but it always was, is, and will be: an ever-living fire, kindling in measures and going out in measures.\nFire is want and satiety.\nAll things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.\nThe thunderbolt steers all things.", "source": "on_nature.txt"}
{"text": "The many are bad, the few are good.\nDonkeys would choose sweepings rather than gold.\nDogs bark at those they do not know.\nTo be wise is the greatest virtue, and wisdom consists in speaking and acting the truth, giving heed to the nature of things.\nOne man is ten thousand to me, if he be the best.\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men, if they have souls that understand not the language.\nThey do not understand how, though at variance with itself, it agrees with itself. It is a backwards-turning attunement like that of the bow and the lyre.", "source": "on_society.txt"}
{"text": "Upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow.\nWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and we are not.\nIt is impossible to step twice into the same river.\nCool things become warm, the warm grows cool, the moist dries, the parched becomes moist.\nThe sun is new each day.", "source": "on_the_river.txt"}
