{"text": "\"What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know, except in so far as a certain understanding must precede every action. The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die.\"\n\"Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\"\n\"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\"\n\"The most common form of despair is not being who you are.\"\n\"To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself.\"\n\"People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\"\n\"Truth is subjectivity.\"\n\"If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!\"\n\"Marry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will regret that too; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\"\n\"It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.\"\n\"The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.\"\n\"There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\"\n\"Listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth \u2014 look at the dying man\u2019s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.\"\n\"I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.\"", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
