AMBIGUITY AND FREEDOM

The continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. "Nature," says Hegel, "is an infinite self-externality."

The fundamental ambiguity of the human condition is that man is a being who makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance.
Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, knowning that man is a "useless passion," they have nevertheless asserted that his passion is useless because there is no external object which can satisfy it, implying that it would be satisfied if it were directed toward the Absolute.

Existentialism asserts that the existing human being is nothing other than what he makes of himself. Thus, it asserts that the end of man is not to be found in any pre-established value or nature, but is rather something to be created by man himself.

To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision.

The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave no room for ethics; it is because man's condition is ambiguous that he seeks, through failure and outrageousness, to save his existence. Thus, to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won.

Man is free; but his freedom is only real in a world where there are other freedoms. He cannot wish his own freedom without also wishing the freedom of others.

The wish for freedom is the wish for the freedom of others.
