Letters to Sartre (Simulated)

My dear Sartre,

I am writing to you from the Café de Flore.  The air is thick with smoke and talk, but I feel a strange solitude amidst the crowd.  I have been thinking about our conversation last night regarding "bad faith."  You insist that the waiter is playing at being a waiter, that he is trapping himself in his role.  But is there not a difference between the waiter's performance and the woman who plays at being "feminine"?

The waiter can take off his apron.  He can leave the café.  His role is a social function, a mask he wears for a wage.  But for a woman, the mask often adheres to the skin.  She is told from birth that her "nature" is to be passive, to be an object for another's gaze.  When she plays at being a woman, she is not just performing a social role; she is enacting an ontological destiny that has been imposed upon her.  Her "bad faith" is complicity, yes, but it is a complicity born of a situation where the alternative is often invisibility or scorn.

I am working on the new chapter.  It is difficult.  I am trying to describe the experience of the young girl who realizes that her body is becoming a trap.  She feels the gaze of men weighing upon her, transforming her freedom into flesh.  It is a vertigo, a nausea—not unlike what Roquentin feels in *Nausea*, but specific to her sex.  She is becoming an object in a world of subjects.

We must speak more of this.  Your concept of radical freedom is exhilarating, but sometimes I fear it is too abstract.  It does not fully account for the viscosity of the situation, the heavy weight of history and custom that clings to us.  Freedom is a conquest, not a given.  And for some, the battle is harder than for others.

I will see you this evening.  Until then, I work.

Your Castor.

November 1946

I am tired of the Americans.  They are so full of energy, yet so lacking in depth.  They speak of "happiness" as if it were a commodity one could buy at the department store.  They do not understand the tragic dimension of existence.  They want problems to have solutions, immediate and practical.  But the human condition is not a problem to be solved; it is a reality to be lived.

We must not let ourselves be seduced by their optimism.  It is a shallow optimism that ignores the reality of oppression and suffering.  They talk of freedom, but they mean the freedom to consume.  Real freedom is the freedom to create, to act, to transform the world.  And that requires discipline, anguish, and the courage to face the void.

I miss Paris.  I miss the grey skies and the sharp edge of our debates.  Here, everything is too bright, too loud.  I feel like a ghost wandering in a Technicolor movie.

On Aging

I looked in the mirror today and saw a stranger.  Who is this woman with the lined face?  We are told that age brings wisdom, but I feel it brings only a sharpening of the essential questions.  Time is slipping away.  My projects, which once seemed infinite, now have a horizon.

But I will not succumb to resignation.  To age is to continue to become.  I must reinvent myself once again.  The past is a heavy burden, but the future is still open, even if it is shorter.  I will write until the end.  I will testify to my own existence, and to the existence of my time.  We must not go gently.  We must burn with a hard, gem-like flame, as Pater said, though in a different sense.  We must be lucid witnesses to our own decline, and turn even that into an act of freedom.
