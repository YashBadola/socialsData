{"text": "Title: Either/Or\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (Victor Eremita)\nDiapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.\n...\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\n...\nMy sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's eyrie is built high up on the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality to seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my booty home. And this booty is a picture I weave into the tapestries at my palace. There I live as a dead man. I immerse everything I have experienced in a baptism of oblivion unto an eternal remembrance. Everything temporal and contingent is forgotten and erased. Then I sit like an old man, grey-haired and thoughtful, and explain the pictures in a soft voice, almost whispering, and at my side a child sits and listens, although he remembers everything before I tell it.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Title: Fear and Trembling\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (Johannes de Silentio)\nPreface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-watcher who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every Assistant Professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to regard it as certain that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to go further. This proceeding they have all performed with such ease that one does not think the least thing of it.\n...\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it, it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nIf this is the highest thing that can be said of man and his existence, then the ethical is of the same nature as man\u2019s eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. suspended teleologically), seeing that as soon as it is suspended it is forfeited, whereas in other cases what is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved precisely in that higher thing which is its telos.\nIf such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his Logic he treats the Good and Conscience as a \u201cform of the abstract,\u201d \u201ca form of the immediate\u201d\u2014but he is wrong in speaking of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted of murder.\nFor faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
