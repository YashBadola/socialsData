The possible corresponds exactly to the future. For freedom the possible is the future, and for time the future is the possible. Corresponding to this in the sphere of the individual life is dread.

The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.

To be a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity’s demand upon him.

Despair is the Sickness Unto Death.

The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die.

The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.

Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.
