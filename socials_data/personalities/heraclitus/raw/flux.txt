Into the same river you could not step twice, for other and still other waters are flowing.
To those entering the same river, other and still other waters flow.
Into the same river we both step and do not step. We both are and are not.
In change is rest.
A mixture separates when not kept in motion.
It disperses and gathers, it comes and goes.
One day is like all.
