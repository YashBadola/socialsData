The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood, however, in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. But despair is precisely the sickness of which one cannot die. To be unable to die is the torment of despair.

The common view is that despair is a rarity. But this is not so. It is quite the opposite. It is the exception that one is not in despair.
