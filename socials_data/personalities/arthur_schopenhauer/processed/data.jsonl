Schopenhauer, the pessimist, had a\nsufficiently optimistic conviction that his message to the world would\nultimately be listened to--a conviction that never failed him during a\nlifetime of disappointments, of neglect in quarters where perhaps he\nwould have most cherished appreciation; a conviction that only showed\nsome signs of being justified a few years before his death. Schopenhauer\nwas no opportunist; he was not even conciliatory; he never hesitated to\ndeclare his own faith in himself, in his principles, in his philosophy;\nhe did not ask to be listened to as a matter of courtesy but as a\nright--a right for which he would struggle, for which he fought, and\nwhich has in the course of time, it may be admitted, been conceded to\nhim.\nAlthough everything that Schopenhauer wrote was written more or less as\nevidence to support his main philosophical thesis, his unifying\nphilosophical principle, the essays in this volume have an interest, if\nnot altogether apart, at least of a sufficiently independent interest to\nenable them to be considered on their own merits, without relation to\nhis main idea. And in dissociating them, if one may do so for a moment\n(their author would have scarcely permitted it!), one feels that one\nenters a field of criticism in which opinions can scarcely vary. So far\nas his philosophy is concerned, this unanimity does not exist; he is one\nof the best abused amongst philosophers; he has many times been\nexplained and condemned exhaustively, and no doubt this will be as many\ntimes repeated. What the trend of his underlying philosophical principal\nwas, his metaphysical explanation of the world, is indicated in almost\nall the following essays, but chiefly in the \"Metaphysics of Love,\" to\nwhich the reader may be referred.\nThese essays are a valuable criticism of life by a man who had a wide\nexperience of life, a man of the world, who possessed an almost inspired\nfaculty of observation. Schopenhauer, of all men, unmistakably observed\nlife at first hand. There is no academic echo in his utterances; he is\nnot one of a school; his voice has no formal intonation; it is deep,\nfull-chested, and rings out its words with all the poignancy of\nindividual emphasis, without bluster, but with unfailing conviction. He\nwas for his time, and for his country, an adept at literary form; but he\nused it only as a means. Complicated as his sentences occasionally are,\nhe says many sharp, many brilliant, many epigrammatic things, he has the\nmanner of the famous essayists, he is paradoxical (how many of his\nparadoxes are now truisms!); one fancies at times that one is almost\nlistening to a creation of Moli\u00e8re, but these fireworks are not merely a\nliterary display, they are used to illumine what he considers to be the\ntruth. _Rien n'est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable_, he\nquotes; he was a deliberate and diligent searcher after truth, always\nstriving to attain the heart of things, to arrive at a knowledge of\nfirst principles. It is, too, not without a sort of grim humour that\nthis psychological vivisectionist attempts to lay bare the skeleton of\nthe human mind, to tear away all the charming little sentiments and\nhypocrisies which in the course of time become a part and parcel of\nhuman life. A man influenced by such motives, and possessing a frank and\ncaustic tongue, was not likely to attain any very large share of popular\nfavour or to be esteemed a companionable sort of person. The fabric of\nsocial life is interwoven with a multitude of delicate evasions, of\nsmall hypocrisies, of matters of tinsel sentiment; social intercourse\nwould be impossible, if it were not so. There is no sort of social\nexistence possible for a person who is ingenuous enough to say always\nwhat he thinks, and, on the whole, one may be thankful that there is\nnot. One naturally enough objects to form the subject of a critical\ndiagnosis and exposure; one chooses for one's friends the agreeable\nhypocrites of life who sustain for one the illusions in which one wishes\nto live. The mere conception of a plain-speaking world is calculated to\nreduce one to the last degree of despair; it is the conception of the\nintolerable. Nevertheless it is good for mankind now and again to have a\nplain speaker, a \"mar feast,\" on the scene; a wizard who devises for us\na spectacle of disillusionment, and lets us for a moment see things as\nhe honestly conceives them to be, and not as we would have them to be.\nBut in estimating the value of a lesson of this sort, we must not be\ncarried too far, not be altogether convinced. We may first take into\naccount the temperament of the teacher; we may ask, is his vision\nperfect? We may indulge in a trifling diagnosis on our own account. And\nin an examination of this sort we find that Schopenhauer stands the test\npretty well, if not with complete success. It strikes us that he suffers\nperhaps a little from a hereditary taint, for we know that there is an\nunmistakable predisposition to hypochondria in his family; we know, for\ninstance, that his paternal grandmother became practically insane\ntowards the end of her life, that two of her children suffered from some\nsort of mental incapacity, and that a third, Schopenhauer's father, was\na man of curious temper and that he probably ended his own life. He\nhimself would also have attached some importance, in a consideration of\nthis sort, to the fact, as he might have put it, that his mother, when\nshe married, acted in the interests of the individual instead of\nunconsciously fulfilling the will of the species, and that the offspring\nof the union suffered in consequence. Still, taking all these things\ninto account, and attaching to them what importance they may be worth,\none is amazed at the clearness of his vision, by his vigorous and at\nmoments subtle perception. If he did not see life whole, what he did see\nhe saw with his own eyes, and then told us all about it with\nunmistakable veracity, and for the most part simply, brilliantly. Too\nmuch importance cannot be attached to this quality of seeing things for\noneself; it is the stamp of a great and original mind; it is the\nprincipal quality of what one calls genius.\nIn possessing Schopenhauer the world possesses a personality the richer;\na somewhat garrulous personality it may be; a curiously whimsical and\nsensitive personality, full of quite ordinary superstitions, of\nextravagant vanities, selfish, at times violent, rarely generous; a man\nwhom during his lifetime nobody quite knew, an isolated creature,\nself-absorbed, solely concerned in his elaboration of the explanation of\nthe world, and possessing subtleties which for the most part escaped the\nperception of his fellows; at once a hermit and a boulevardier. His was\nessentially a great temperament; his whole life was a life of ideas, an\nintellectual life. And his work, the fruit of his life, would seem to be\nstanding the test of all great work--the test of time. It is not a\nlittle curious that one so little realised in his own day, one so little\nlovable and so little loved, should now speak to us from his pages with\nsomething of the force of personal utterance, as if he were actually\nwith us and as if we knew him, even as we know Charles Lamb and Izaak\nWalton, personalities of such a different calibre. And this man whom we\nrealise does not impress us unfavourably; if he is without charm, he is\nsurely immensely interesting and attractive; he is so strong in his\nintellectual convictions, he is so free from intellectual affectations,\nhe is such an ingenuous egotist, so na\u00efvely human; he is so mercilessly\nhonest and independent, and, at times (one may be permitted to think),\nso mistaken.\nR.D.\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\nArthur Schopenhauer was born at No. 117 of the Heiligengeist Strasse, at\nDantzic, on February 22, 1788. His parents on both sides traced their\ndescent from Dutch ancestry, the great-grandfather of his mother having\noccupied some ecclesiastical position at Gorcum. Dr. Gwinner in his\n_Life_ does not follow the Dutch ancestry on the father's side, but\nmerely states that the great-grandfather of Schopenhauer at the\nbeginning of the eighteenth century rented a farm, the Stuthof, in the\nneighbourhood of Dantzic. This ancestor, Andreas Schopenhauer, received\nhere on one occasion an unexpected visit from Peter the Great and\nCatherine, and it is related that there being no stove in the chamber\nwhich the royal pair selected for the night, their host, for the purpose\nof heating it, set fire to several small bottles of brandy which had\nbeen emptied on the stone floor. His son Andreas followed in the\nfootsteps of his father, combining a commercial career with country\npursuits. He died in 1794 at Ohra, where he had purchased an estate, and\nto which he had retired to spend his closing years. His wife (the\ngrandmother of Arthur) survived him for some years, although shortly\nafter his death she was declared insane and incapable of managing her\naffairs. This couple had four sons: the eldest, Michael Andreas, was\nweak-minded; the second, Karl Gottfried, was also mentally weak and had\ndeserted his people for evil companions; the youngest son, Heinrich\nFloris, possessed, however, in a considerable degree the qualities which\nhis brothers lacked. He possessed intelligence, a strong character, and\nhad great commercial sagacity; at the same time, he took a definite\ninterest in intellectual pursuits, reading Voltaire, of whom he was more\nor less a disciple, and other French authors, possessing a keen\nadmiration for English political and family life, and furnishing his\nhouse after an English fashion. He was a man of fiery temperament and\nhis appearance was scarcely prepossessing; he was short and stout; he\nhad a broad face and turned-up nose, and a large mouth. This was the\nfather of our philosopher.\nWhen he was thirty-eight, Heinrich Schopenhauer married, on May 16,\n1785, Johanna Henriette Trosiener, a young lady of eighteen, and\ndaughter of a member of the City Council of Dantzic. She was at this\ntime an attractive, cultivated young person, of a placid disposition,\nwho seems to have married more because marriage offered her a\ncomfortable settlement and assured position in life, than from any\npassionate affection for her wooer, which, it is just to her to say, she\ndid not profess. Heinrich Schopenhauer was so much influenced by English\nideas that he desired that his first child should be born in England;\nand thither, some two years after their marriage, the pair, after making\na _d\u00e9tour_ on the Continent, arrived. But after spending some weeks in\nLondon Mrs. Schopenhauer was seized with home-sickness, and her husband\nacceded to her entreaties to return to Dantzic, where a child, the\nfuture philosopher, was shortly afterwards born. The first five years of\nthe child's life were spent in the country, partly at the Stuthof which\nhad formerly belonged to Andreas Schopenhauer, but had recently come\ninto the possession of his maternal grandfather.\nFive years after the birth of his son, Heinrich Schopenhauer, in\nconsequence of the political crisis, which he seems to have taken keenly\nto heart, in the affairs of the Hanseatic town of Dantzic, transferred\nhis business and his home to Hamburg, where in 1795 a second child,\nAdele, was born. Two years later, Heinrich, who intended to train his\nson for a business life, took him, with this idea, to Havre, by way of\nParis, where they spent a little time, and left him there with M.\nGr\u00e9goire, a commercial connection. Arthur remained at Havre for two\nyears, receiving private instruction with this man's son Anthime, with\nwhom he struck up a strong friendship, and when he returned to Hamburg\nit was found that he remembered but few words of his mother-tongue. Here\nhe was placed in one of the principal private schools, where he remained\nfor three years. Both his parents, but especially his mother, cultivated\nat this time the society of literary people, and entertained at their\nhouse Klopstock and other notable persons. In the summer following his\nreturn home from Havre he accompanied his parents on a continental tour,\nstopping amongst other places at Weimar, where he saw Schiller. His\nmother, too, had considerable literary tastes, and a distinct literary\ngift which, later, she cultivated to some advantage, and which brought\nher in the production of accounts of travel and fiction a not\ninconsiderable reputation. It is, therefore, not surprising that\nliterary tendencies began to show themselves in her son, accompanied by\na growing distaste for the career of commerce which his father wished\nhim to follow. Heinrich Schopenhauer, although deprecating these\ntendencies, considered the question of purchasing a canonry for his son,\nbut ultimately gave up the idea on the score of expense. He then\nproposed to take him on an extended trip to France, where he might meet\nhis young friend Anthime, and then to England, if he would give up the\nidea of a literary calling, and the proposal was accepted.\nIn the spring of 1803, then, he accompanied his parents to London,\nwhere, after spending some time in sight-seeing, he was placed in the\nschool of Mr. Lancaster at Wimbledon. Here he remained for three months,\nfrom July to September, laying the foundation of his knowledge of the\nEnglish language, while his parents proceeded to Scotland. English\nformality, and what he conceived to be English hypocrisy, did not\ncontrast favourably with his earlier and gayer experiences in France,\nand made an extremely unfavourable impression upon his mind; which found\nexpression in letters to his friends and to his mother.\nOn returning to Hamburg after this extended excursion abroad,\nSchopenhauer was placed in the office of a Hamburg senator called\nJenisch, but he was as little inclined as ever to follow a commercial\ncareer, and secretly shirked his work so that he might pursue his\nstudies. A little later a somewhat unexplainable calamity occurred. When\nDantzic ceased to be a free city, and Heinrich Schopenhauer at a\nconsiderable cost and monetary sacrifice transferred his business to\nHamburg, the event caused him much bitterness of spirit. At Hamburg his\nbusiness seems to have undergone fluctuations. Whether these further\naffected his spirit is not sufficiently established, but it is certain,\nhowever, that he developed peculiarities of manner, and that his temper\nbecame more violent. At any rate, one day in April 1805 it was found\nthat he had either fallen or thrown himself into the canal from an upper\nstorey of a granary; it was generally concluded that it was a case of\nsuicide.\nSchopenhauer was seventeen at the time of this catastrophe, by which he\nwas naturally greatly affected. Although by the death of his father the\ninfluence which impelled him to a commercial career was removed, his\nveneration for the dead man remained with him through life, and on one\noccasion found expression in a curious tribute to his memory in a\ndedication (which was not, however, printed) to the second edition of\n_Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung._ \"That I could make use of and\ncultivate in a right direction the powers which nature gave me,\" he\nconcludes, \"that I could follow my natural impulse and think and work\nfor countless others without the help of any one; for that I thank thee,\nmy father, thank thy activity, thy cleverness, thy thrift and care for\nthe future. Therefore I praise thee, my noble father. And every one who\nfrom my work derives any pleasure, consolation, or instruction shall\nhear thy name and know that if Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer had not been\nthe man he was, Arthur Schopenhauer would have been a hundred times\nruined.\"\nThe year succeeding her husband's death, Johanna Schopenhauer removed\nwith her daughter to Weimar, after having attended to the settlement of\nher husband's affairs, which left her in possession of a considerable\nincome. At Weimar she devoted herself to the pursuit of literature, and\nheld twice a week a sort of salon, which was attended by Goethe, the two\nSchlegels, Wieland, Heinrich Meyer, Grimm, and other literary persons of\nnote. Her son meanwhile continued for another year at the \"dead timber\nof the desk,\" when his mother, acting under the advice of her friend\nFernow, consented, to his great joy, to his following his literary bent.\nDuring the next few years we find Schopenhauer devoting himself\nassiduously to acquiring the equipment for a learned career; at first at\nthe Gymnasium at Gotha, where he penned some satirical verses on one of\nthe masters, which brought him into some trouble. He removed in\nconsequence to Weimar, where he pursued his classical studies under the\ndirection of Franz Passow, at whose house he lodged. Unhappily, during\nhis sojourn at Weimar his relations with his mother became strained. One\nfeels that there is a sort of autobiographical interest in his essay on\nwomen, that his view was largely influenced by his relations with his\nmother, just as one feels that his particular argument in his essay on\neducation is largely influenced by the course of his own training.\nOn his coming of age Schopenhauer was entitled to a share of the\npaternal estate, a share which yielded him a yearly income of about\n\u00a3150. He now entered himself at the University of G\u00f6ttingen (October\n1809), enrolling himself as a student of medicine, and devoting himself\nto the study of the natural sciences, mineralogy, anatomy, mathematics,\nand history; later, he included logic, physiology, and ethnography. He\nhad always been passionately devoted to music and found relaxation in\nlearning to play the flute and guitar. His studies at this time did not\npreoccupy him to the extent of isolation; he mixed freely with his\nfellows, and reckoned amongst his friends or acquaintances, F.W. Kreise,\nBunsen, and Ernst Schulze. During one vacation he went on an expedition\nto Cassel and to the Hartz Mountains. It was about this time, and partly\nowing to the influence of Schulze, the author of _Aenesidemus_, and then\na professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, that Schopenhauer came to\nrealise his vocation as that of a philosopher.\nDuring his holiday at Weimar he called upon Wieland, then seventy-eight\nyears old, who, probably prompted by Mrs. Schopenhauer, tried to\ndissuade him from the vocation which he had chosen. Schopenhauer in\nreply said, \"Life is a difficult question; I have decided to spend my\nlife in thinking about it.\" Then, after the conversation had continued\nfor some little time, Wieland declared warmly that he thought that he\nhad chosen rightly. \"I understand your nature,\" he said; \"keep to\nphilosophy.\" And, later, he told Johanna Schopenhauer that he thought\nher son would be a great man some day.\nTowards the close of the summer of 1811 Schopenhauer removed to Berlin\nand entered the University. He here continued his study of the natural\nsciences; he also attended the lectures on the History of Philosophy by\nSchleiermacher, and on Greek Literature and Antiquities by F.A. Wolf,\nand the lectures on \"Facts of Consciousness\" and \"Theory of Science\" by\nFichte, for the last of whom, as we know indeed from frequent references\nin his books, he had no little contempt. A year or so later, when the\nnews of Napoleon's disaster in Russia arrived, the Germans were thrown\ninto a state of great excitement, and made speedy preparations for war.\nSchopenhauer contributed towards equipping volunteers for the army, but\nhe did not enter active service; indeed, when the result of the battle\nof L\u00fctzen was known and Berlin seemed to be in danger, he fled for\nsafety to Dresden and thence to Weimar. A little later we find him at\nRudolstadt, whither he had proceeded in consequence of the recurrence of\ndifferences with his mother, and remained there from June to November\n1813, principally engaged in the composition of an essay, \"A\nPhilosophical Treatise on the Fourfold Root of the Principle of\nSufficient Reason,\" which he offered to the University of Jena as an\nexercise to qualify for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and for\nwhich a diploma was granted. He published this essay at his own cost\ntowards the end of the year, but it seems to have fallen flatly from the\npress, although its arguments attracted the attention and the sympathy\nof Goethe, who, meeting him on his return to Weimar in November,\ndiscussed with him his own theory of colour. A couple of years before,\nGoethe, who was opposed to the Newtonian theory of light, had brought\nout his _Farbenlehre_ (colour theory). In Goethe's diary Schopenhauer's\nname frequently occurs, and on the 24th November 1813 he wrote to\nKnebel: \"Young Schopenhauer is a remarkable and interesting man.... I\nfind him intellectual, but I am undecided about him as far as other\nthings go.\" The result of this association with Goethe was his _Ueber\ndas Sehn und die Farben_ (\"On Vision and Colour\"), published at Leipzig\nin 1816, a copy of which he forwarded to Goethe (who had already seen\nthe MS.) on the 4th May of that year. A few days later Goethe wrote to\nthe distinguished scientist, Dr. Seebeck, asking him to read the work.\nIn Gwinner's _Life_ we find the copy of a letter written in English to\nSir C.L. Eastlake: \"In the year 1830, as I was going to publish in Latin\nthe same treatise which in German accompanies this letter, I went to Dr.\nSeebeck of the Berlin Academy, who is universally admitted to be the\nfirst natural philosopher (in the English sense of the word meaning\nphysiker) of Germany; he is the discoverer of thermo-electricity and of\nseveral physical truths. I questioned him on his opinion on the\ncontroversy between Goethe and Newton; he was extremely cautious and\nmade me promise that I should not print and publish anything of what he\nmight say, and at last, being hard pressed by me, he confessed that\nindeed Goethe was perfectly right and Newton wrong, but that he had no\nbusiness to tell the world so. He has died since, the old coward!\"\nIn May 1814 Schopenhauer removed from Weimar to Dresden, in consequence\nof the recurrence of domestic differences with his mother. This was the\nfinal break between the pair, and he did not see her again during the\nremaining twenty-four years of her life, although they resumed\ncorrespondence some years before her death. It were futile to attempt to\nrevive the dead bones of the cause of these unfortunate differences\nbetween Johanna Schopenhauer and her son. It was a question of opposing\ntemperaments; both and neither were at once to blame. There is no reason\nto suppose that Schopenhauer was ever a conciliatory son, or a\ncompanionable person to live with; in fact, there is plenty to show that\nhe possessed trying and irritating qualities, and that he assumed an\nattitude of criticism towards his mother that could not in any\ncircumstances be agreeable. On the other hand, Anselm Feuerbach in his\n_Memoirs_ furnishes us with a scarcely prepossessing picture of Mrs.\nSchopenhauer: \"Madame Schopenhauer,\" he writes, \"a rich widow. Makes\nprofession of erudition. Authoress. Prattles much and well,\nintelligently; without heart and soul. Self-complacent, eager after\napprobation, and constantly smiling to herself. God preserve us from\nwomen whose mind has shot up into mere intellect.\"\nSchopenhauer meanwhile was working out his philosophical system, the\nidea of his principal philosophical work. \"Under my hands,\" he wrote in\n1813, \"and still more in my mind grows a work, a philosophy which will\nbe an ethics and a metaphysics in one:--two branches which hitherto have\nbeen separated as falsely as man has been divided into soul and body.\nThe work grows, slowly and gradually aggregating its parts like the\nchild in the womb. I became aware of one member, one vessel, one part\nafter another. In other words, I set each sentence down without anxiety\nas to how it will fit into the whole; for I know it has all sprung from\na single foundation. It is thus that an organic whole originates, and\nthat alone will live.... Chance, thou ruler of this sense-world! Let me\nlive and find peace for yet a few years, for I love my work as the\nmother her child. When it is matured and has come to birth, then exact\nfrom me thy duties, taking interest for the postponement. But, if I sink\nbefore the time in this iron age, then grant that these miniature\nbeginnings, these studies of mine, be given to the world as they are and\nfor what they are: some day perchance will arise a kindred spirit, who\ncan frame the members together and 'restore' the fragment of\nantiquity.\"[1]\nBy March 1817 he had completed the preparatory work of his system, and\nbegan to put the whole thing together; a year later _Die Welt als Wille\nund Vorstellung: vier B\u00fccher, nebst einem Anhange, der die Kritik der\nKantischen Philosophie enth\u00e4lt_ (\"The World as Will and Idea; four\nbooks, with an appendix containing a criticism on the philosophy of\nKant\"). Some delay occurring in the publication, Schopenhauer wrote one\nof his characteristically abusive letters to Brockhaus, his publisher,\nwho retorted \"that he must decline all further correspondence with one\nwhose letters, in their divine coarseness and rusticity, savoured more\nof the cabman than of the philosopher,\" and concluded with a hope that\nhis fears that the work he was printing would be good for nothing but\nwaste paper, might not be realised.[2] The work appeared about the end\nof December 1818 with 1819 on the title-page. Schopenhauer had meanwhile\nproceeded in September to Italy, where he revised the final proofs. So\nfar as the reception of the work was concerned there was reason to\nbelieve that the fears of Brockhaus would be realised, as, in fact, they\ncame practically to be. But in the face of this general want of\nappreciation, Schopenhauer had some crumbs of consolation. His sister\nwrote to him in March (he was then staying at Naples) that Goethe \"had\nreceived it with great joy, immediately cut the thick book, and began\n_instantly_ to read it. An hour later he sent me a note to say that he\nthanked you very much and thought that the whole book was good. He\npointed out the most important passages, read them to us, and was\ngreatly delighted.... You are the only author whom Goethe has ever read\nseriously, it seems to me, and I rejoice.\" Nevertheless the book did not\nsell. Sixteen years later Brockhaus informed Schopenhauer that a large\nnumber of copies had been sold at waste paper price, and that he had\neven then a few in stock. Still, during the years 1842-43, Schopenhauer\nwas contemplating the issue of a second edition and making revisions for\nthat purpose; when he had completed the work he took it to Brockhaus,\nand agreed to leave the question of remuneration open. In the following\nyear the second edition was issued (500 copies of the first volume, and\n750 of the second), and for this the author was to receive no\nremuneration. \"Not to my contemporaries,\" says Schopenhauer with fine\nconviction in his preface to this edition, \"not to my compatriots--to\nmankind I commit my now completed work, in the confidence that it will\nnot be without value for them, even if this should be late recognised,\nas is commonly the lot of what is good. For it cannot have been for the\npassing generation, engrossed with the delusion of the moment, that my\nmind, almost against my will, has uninterruptedly stuck to its work\nthrough the course of a long life. And while the lapse of time has not\nbeen able to make me doubt the worth of my work, neither has the lack of\nsympathy; for I constantly saw the false and the bad, and finally the\nabsurd and senseless, stand in universal admiration and honour, and I\nbethought myself that if it were not the case, those who are capable of\nrecognising the genuine and right are so rare that we may look for them\nin vain for some twenty years, then those who are capable of producing\nit could not be so few that their works afterwards form an exception to\nthe perishableness of earthly things; and thus would be lost the\nreviving prospect of posterity which every one who sets before himself a\nhigh aim requires to strengthen him.\"[3]\nWhen Schopenhauer started for Italy Goethe had provided him with a\nletter of introduction to Lord Byron, who was then staying at Venice,\nbut Schopenhauer never made use of the letter; he said that he hadn't\nthe courage to present himself. \"Do you know,\" he says in a letter,\n\"three great pessimists were in Italy at the same time--Byron, Leopardi,\nand myself! And yet not one of us has made the acquaintance of the\nother.\" He remained in Italy until June 1819, when he proceeded to\nMilan, where he received distressing news from his sister to the effect\nthat a Dantzic firm, in which she and her mother had invested all their\ncapital, and in which he himself had invested a little, had become\nbankrupt. Schopenhauer immediately proposed to share his own income with\nthem. But later, when the defaulting firm offered to its creditors a\ncomposition of thirty per cent, Schopenhauer would accept nothing less\nthan seventy per cent in the case of immediate payment, or the whole if\nthe payment were deferred; and he was so indignant at his mother and\nsister falling in with the arrangement of the debtors, that he did not\ncorrespond with them again for eleven years. With reference to this\naffair he wrote: \"I can imagine that from your point of view my\nbehaviour may seem hard and unfair. That is a mere illusion which\ndisappears as soon as you reflect that all I want is merely not to have\ntaken from me what is most rightly and incontestably mine, what,\nmoreover, my whole happiness, my freedom, my learned leisure depend\nupon;--a blessing which in this world people like me enjoy so rarely\nthat it would be almost as unconscientious as cowardly not to defend it\nto the uttermost and maintain it by every exertion. You say, perhaps,\nthat if all your creditors were of this way of thinking, I too should\ncome badly off. But if all men thought as I do, there would be much more\nthinking done, and in that case probably there would be neither\nbankruptcies, nor wars, nor gaming tables.\"[4]\nIn July 1819, when he was at Heidelberg, the idea occurred to him of\nturning university lecturer, and took practical shape the following\nsummer, when he delivered a course of lectures on philosophy at the\nBerlin University. But the experiment was not a success; the course was\nnot completed through the want of attendance, while Hegel at the same\ntime and place was lecturing to a crowded and enthusiastic audience.\nThis failure embittered him, and during the next few years there is\nlittle of any moment in his life to record. There was one incident,\nhowever, to which his detractors would seem to have attached more\nimportance than it was worth, but which must have been sufficiently\ndisturbing to Schopenhauer--we refer to the Marquet affair. It appears\non his returning home one day he found three women gossiping outside his\ndoor, one of whom was a seamstress who occupied another room in the\nhouse. Their presence irritated Schopenhauer (whose sensitiveness in\nsuch matters may be estimated from his essay \"On Noise\"), who, finding\nthem occupying the same position on another occasion, requested them to\ngo away, but the seamstress replied that she was an honest person and\nrefused to move. Schopenhauer disappeared into his apartments and\nreturned with a stick. According to his own account, he offered his arm\nto the woman in order to take her out; but she would not accept it, and\nremained where she was. He then threatened to put her out, and carried\nhis threat into execution by seizing her round the waist and putting her\nout. She screamed, and attempted to return. Schopenhauer now pushed her\nout; the woman fell, and raised the whole house. This woman, Caroline\nLuise Marquet, brought an action against him for damages, alleging that\nhe had kicked and beaten her. Schopenhauer defended his own case, with\nthe result that the action was dismissed. The woman appealed, and\nSchopenhauer, who was contemplating going to Switzerland, did not alter\nhis plans, so that the appeal was heard during his absence, the judgment\nreversed, and he was mulcted in a fine of twenty thalers. But the\nunfortunate business did not end here. Schopenhauer proceeded from\nSwitzerland to Italy, and did not return to Berlin until May 1825.\nCaroline Marquet renewed her complaints before the courts, stating that\nhis ill-usage had occasioned a fever through which she had lost the\npower of one of her arms, that her whole system was entirely shaken, and\ndemanding a monthly allowance as compensation. She won her case; the\ndefendant had to pay three hundred thalers in costs and contribute sixty\nthalers a year to her maintenance while she lived. Schopenhauer on\nreturning to Berlin did what he could to get the judgment reversed, but\nunsuccessfully. The woman lived for twenty years; he inscribed on her\ndeath certificate, \"_Obit anus, obit onus\"_\nThe idea of marriage seems to have more or less possessed Schopenhauer\nabout this time, but he could not finally determine to take the step.\nThere is sufficient to show in the following essays in what light he\nregarded women. Marriage was a debt, he said, contracted in youth and\npaid off in old age. Married people have the whole burden of life to\nbear, while the unmarried have only half, was a characteristically\nselfish apothegm. Had not all the true philosophers been\ncelibates--Descartes, Leibnitz, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Kant? The\nclassic writers were of course not to be considered, because with them\nwoman occupied a subordinate position. Had not all the great poets\nmarried, and with disastrous consequences? Plainly, Schopenhauer was not\nthe person to sacrifice the individual to the will of the species.\nIn August 1831 he made a fortuitous expedition to\nFrankfort-on-the-Main--an expedition partly prompted by the outbreak of\ncholera at Berlin at the time, and partly by the portent of a dream (he\nwas credulous in such matters) which at the beginning of the year had\nintimated his death. Here, however, he practically remained until his\ndeath, leading a quiet, mechanically regular life and devoting his\nthoughts to the development of his philosophic ideas, isolated at first,\nbut as time went on enjoying somewhat greedily the success which had\nbeen denied him in his earlier days. In February 1839 he had a moment of\nelation when he heard from the Scientific Society of Drontheim that he\nhad won the prize for the best essay on the question, \"Whether free will\ncould be proved from the evidence of consciousness,\" and that he had\nbeen elected a member of the Society; and a corresponding moment of\ndespondency when he was informed by the Royal Danish Academy of the\nSciences at Copenhagen, in a similar competition, that his essay on\n\"Whether the source and foundation of ethics was to be sought in an\nintuitive moral idea, and in the analysis of other derivative moral\nconceptions, or in some other principle of knowledge,\" had failed,\npartly on the ground of the want of respect which it showed to the\nopinions of the chief philosophers. He published these essays in 1841\nunder the title of \"The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics,\" and ten\nyears later _Parerga und Paralipomena_ the composition of which had\nengaged his attention for five or six years. The latter work, which\nproved to be his most popular, was refused by three publishers, and when\neventually it was accepted by Hayn of Berlin, the author only received\nten free copies of his work as payment. It is from this book that all\nexcept one of the following essays have been selected; the exception is\n\"The Metaphysics of Love,\" which appears in the supplement of the third\nbook of his principal work. The second edition of _Die Welt als Wille\nund Vorstellung_ appeared in 1844, and was received with growing\nappreciation. Hitherto he had been chiefly known in Frankfort as the son\nof the celebrated Johanna Schopenhauer; now he came to have a following\nwhich, if at first small in numbers, were sufficiently enthusiastic, and\nproved, indeed, so far as his reputation was concerned, helpful. Artists\npainted his portrait; a bust of him was made by Elizabeth Ney. In the\nApril number of the _Westminster Review_ for 1853 John Oxenford, in an\narticle entitled \"Iconoclasm in German Philosophy,\" heralded in England\nhis recognition as a writer and thinker; three years later Saint-Ren\u00e9\nTaillandier, in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, did a similar service for\nhim in France. One of his most enthusiastic admirers was Richard Wagner,\nwho in 1854 sent him a copy of his _Der Ring der Nibelungen_, with the\ninscription \"In admiration and gratitude.\" The Philosophical Faculty of\nthe University of Leipzic offered a prize for an exposition and\ncriticism of his philosophical system. Two Frenchmen, M. Foucher de\nCareil and M. Challemel Lacour, who visited Schopenhauer during his last\ndays, have given an account of their impressions of the interview, the\nlatter in an article entitled, \"Un Bouddhiste Contemporain en\nAllemagne,\" which appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ for March\n15th, 1870. M. Foucher de Careil gives a charming picture of him:--\"Quand je le vis, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, en 1859, \u00e0 la table de\nl'h\u00f4tel d'Angleterre, \u00e0 Francfort, c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un vieillard, \u00e0\nl'oeil d'un bleu vif et limpide, \u00e0 la l\u00e8vre mince et l\u00e9g\u00e8rement\nsarcastique, autour de laquelle errait un fin sourire, et dont le\nvaste front, estomp\u00e9 de deux touffes de cheveux blancs sur les\nc\u00f4t\u00e9s, relevait d'un cachet de noblesse et de distinction la\nphysionomie petillante d'esprit et de malice. Les habits, son jabot\nde dentelle, sa cravate blanche rappelaient un vieillard de la fin\ndu r\u00e8gne de Louis XV; ses mani\u00e8res \u00e9taient celles d'un homme de\nbonne compagnie. Habituellement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 et d'un naturel craintif\njusqu'\u00e0 la m\u00e9fiance, il ne se livrait qu'avec ses intimes ou les\n\u00e9trangers de passage \u00e0 Francfort. Ses mouvements \u00e9taient vifs et\ndevenaient d'une p\u00e9tulance extraordinaire dans la conversation; il\nfuyait les discussions et les vains combats de paroles, mais c'\u00e9tait\npour mieux jouir du charme d'une causerie intime. Il poss\u00e9dait et\nparlait avec une \u00e9gale perfection quatre langues: le fran\u00e7ais,\nl'anglais, l'allemand, l'italien et passablement l'espagnol. Quand\nil causait, la verve du vieillard brodait sur le canevas un peu\nlourd de l'allemand ses brilliantes arabesques latines, grecques,\nfran\u00e7aises, anglaises, italiennes. C'\u00e9tait un entrain, une pr\u00e9cision\net des sailles, une richesse de citations, une exactitude de d\u00e9tails\nqui faisait couler les heures; et quelquefois le petit cercle de ses\nintimes l'\u00e9coutait jusqu'\u00e0 minuit, sans qu'un moment de fatigue se\nf\u00fbt peint sur ses traits ou que le feu de son regard se f\u00fbt un\ninstant amorti. Sa parole nette et accentu\u00e9e captivait l'auditoire:\nelle peignait et analysait tout ensemble; une sensibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9licate\nen augmentait le feu; elle \u00e9tait exacte et pr\u00e9cise sur toutes sortes\nde sujets.\"\nSchopenhauer died on the 20th September 1860, in his seventy-third year,\npeacefully, alone as he had lived, but not without warning. One day in\nApril, taking his usual brisk walk after dinner, he suffered from\npalpitation of the heart, he could scarcely breathe. These symptoms\ndeveloped during the next few months, and Dr. Gwinner advised him to\ndiscontinue his cold baths and to breakfast in bed; but Schopenhauer,\nnotwithstanding his early medical training, was little inclined to\nfollow medical advice. To Dr. Gwinner, on the evening of the 18th\nSeptember, when he expressed a hope that he might be able to go to\nItaly, he said that it would be a pity if he died now, as he wished to\nmake several important additions to his _Parerga_; he spoke about his\nworks and of the warm recognition with which they had been welcomed in\nthe most remote places. Dr. Gwinner had never before found him so eager\nand gentle, and left him reluctantly, without, however, the least\npremonition that he had seen him for the last time. On the second\nmorning after this interview Schopenhauer got up as usual, and had his\ncold bath and breakfast. His servant had opened the window to let in the\nmorning air and had then left him. A little later Dr. Gwinner arrived\nand found him reclining in a corner of the sofa; his face wore its\ncustomary expression; there was no sign of there having been any\nstruggle with death. There had been no struggle with death; he had died,\nas he had hoped he would die, painlessly, easily.\nIn preparing the above notice the writer has to acknowledge her\nindebtedness to Dr. Gwinner's _Life_ and Professor Wallace's little work\non the same subject, as well as to the few other authorities that have\nbeen available.--THE TRANSLATOR.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[1] Wallace's _Life_, pp. 95, 96.\n[2] Wallace, p. 108.\n[3] Haldane and Kemp's _The World as Will and Idea_.\n[4] Wallace, p. 145.\nESSAYS OF SCHOPENHAUER.\nON AUTHORSHIP AND STYLE.\nThere are, first of all, two kinds of authors: those who write for the\nsubject's sake, and those who write for writing's sake. The first kind\nhave had thoughts or experiences which seem to them worth communicating,\nwhile the second kind need money and consequently write for money. They\nthink in order to write, and they may be recognised by their spinning\nout their thoughts to the greatest possible length, and also by the way\nthey work out their thoughts, which are half-true, perverse, forced, and\nvacillating; then also by their love of evasion, so that they may seem\nwhat they are not; and this is why their writing is lacking in\ndefiniteness and clearness.\nConsequently, it is soon recognised that they write for the sake of\nfilling up the paper, and this is the case sometimes with the best\nauthors; for example, in parts of Lessing's _Dramaturgie_, and even in\nmany of Jean Paul's romances. As soon as this is perceived the book\nshould be thrown away, for time is precious. As a matter of fact, the\nauthor is cheating the reader as soon as he writes for the sake of\nfilling up paper; because his pretext for writing is that he has\nsomething to impart. Writing for money and preservation of copyright\nare, at bottom, the ruin of literature. It is only the man who writes\nabsolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth\nwriting. What an inestimable advantage it would be, if, in every branch\nof literature, there existed only a few but excellent books! This can\nnever come to pass so long as money is to be made by writing. It seems\nas if money lay under a curse, for every author deteriorates directly he\nwrites in any way for the sake of money. The best works of great men all\ncome from the time when they had to write either for nothing or for very\nlittle pay. This is confirmed by the Spanish proverb: _honra y provecho\nno caben en un saco_ (Honour and money are not to be found in the same\npurse). The deplorable condition of the literature of to-day, both in\nGermany and other countries, is due to the fact that books are written\nfor the sake of earning money. Every one who is in want of money sits\ndown and writes a book, and the public is stupid enough to buy it. The\nsecondary effect of this is the ruin of language.\nA great number of bad authors eke out their existence entirely by the\nfoolishness of the public, which only will read what has just been\nprinted. I refer to journalists, who have been appropriately so-called.\nIn other words, it would be \"day labourer.\"\n*       *       *       *       *\nAgain, it may be said that there are three kinds of authors. In the\nfirst place, there are those who write without thinking. They write from\nmemory, from reminiscences, or even direct from other people's books.\nThis class is the most numerous. In the second, those who think whilst\nthey are writing. They think in order to write; and they are numerous.\nIn the third place, there are those who have thought before they begin\nto write. They write solely because they have thought; and they are\nrare.\nAuthors of the second class, who postpone their thinking until they\nbegin to write, are like a sportsman who goes out at random--he is not\nlikely to bring home very much. While the writing of an author of the\nthird, the rare class, is like a chase where the game has been captured\nbeforehand and cooped up in some enclosure from which it is afterwards\nset free, so many at a time, into another enclosure, where it is not\npossible for it to escape, and the sportsman has now nothing to do but\nto aim and fire--that is to say, put his thoughts on paper. This is the\nkind of sport which yields something.\nBut although the number of those authors who really and seriously think\nbefore they write is small, only extremely few of them think about _the\nsubject itself_; the rest think only about the books written on this\nsubject, and what has been said by others upon it, I mean. In order to\nthink, they must have the more direct and powerful incentive of other\npeople's thoughts. These become their next theme, and therefore they\nalways remain under their influence and are never, strictly speaking,\noriginal. On the contrary, the former are roused to thought through the\n_subject itself_, hence their thinking is directed immediately to it. It\nis only among them that we find the authors whose names become immortal.\nLet it be understood that I am speaking here of writers of the higher\nbranches of literature, and not of writers on the method of distilling\nbrandy.\nIt is only the writer who takes the material on which he writes direct\nout of his own head that is worth reading. Book manufacturers,\ncompilers, and the ordinary history writers, and others like them, take\ntheir material straight out of books; it passes into their fingers\nwithout its having paid transit duty or undergone inspection when it was\nin their heads, to say nothing of elaboration. (How learned many a man\nwould be if he knew everything that was in his own books!) Hence their\ntalk is often of such a vague nature that one racks one's brains in vain\nto understand of _what_ they are really thinking. They are not thinking\nat all. The book from which they copy is sometimes composed in the same\nway: so that writing of this kind is like a plaster cast of a cast of a\ncast, and so on, until finally all that is left is a scarcely\nrecognisable outline of the face of Antinous. Therefore, compilations\nshould be read as seldom as possible: it is difficult to avoid them\nentirely, since compendia, which contain in a small space knowledge that\nhas been collected in the course of several centuries, are included in\ncompilations.\nNo greater mistake can be made than to imagine that what has been\nwritten latest is always the more correct; that what is written later on\nis an improvement on what was written previously; and that every change\nmeans progress. Men who think and have correct judgment, and people who\ntreat their subject earnestly, are all exceptions only. Vermin is the\nrule everywhere in the world: it is always at hand and busily engaged in\ntrying to improve in its own way upon the mature deliberations of the\nthinkers. So that if a man wishes to improve himself in any subject he\nmust guard against immediately seizing the newest books written upon it,\nin the assumption that science is always advancing and that the older\nbooks have been made use of in the compiling of the new. They have, it\nis true, been used; but how? The writer often does not thoroughly\nunderstand the old books; he will, at the same time, not use their exact\nwords, so that the result is he spoils and bungles what has been said in\na much better and clearer way by the old writers; since they wrote from\ntheir own lively knowledge of the subject. He often leaves out the best\nthings they have written, their most striking elucidations of the\nmatter, their happiest remarks, because he does not recognise their\nvalue or feel how pregnant they are. It is only what is stupid and\nshallow that appeals to him. An old and excellent book is frequently\nshelved for new and bad ones; which, written for the sake of money, wear\na pretentious air and are much eulogised by the authors' friends. In\nscience, a man who wishes to distinguish himself brings something new to\nmarket; this frequently consists in his denouncing some principle that\nhas been previously held as correct, so that he may establish a wrong\none of his own. Sometimes his attempt is successful for a short time,\nwhen a return is made to the old and correct doctrine. These innovators\nare serious about nothing else in the world than their own priceless\nperson, and it is this that they wish to make its mark. They bring this\nquickly about by beginning a paradox; the sterility of their own heads\nsuggests their taking the path of negation; and truths that have long\nbeen recognised are now denied--for instance, the vital power, the\nsympathetic nervous system, _generatio equivoca_, Bichat's distinction\nbetween the working of the passions and the working of intelligence, or\nthey return to crass atomism, etc., etc. Hence _the course of science is\noften retrogressive_.\nTo this class of writers belong also those translators who, besides\ntranslating their author, at the same time correct and alter him, a\nthing that always seems to me impertinent. Write books yourself which\nare worth translating and leave the books of other people as they are.\nOne should read, if it is possible, the real authors, the founders and\ndiscoverers of things, or at any rate the recognised great masters in\nevery branch of learning, and buy second-hand _books_ rather than read\ntheir _contents_ in new ones.\nIt is true that _inventis aliquid addere facile est_, therefore a man,\nafter having studied the principles of his subject, will have to make\nhimself acquainted with the more recent information written upon it. In\ngeneral, the following rule holds good here as elsewhere, namely: what\nis new is seldom good; because a good thing is only new for a short\ntime.\nWhat the address is to a letter the _title_ should be to a book--that\nis, its immediate aim should be to bring the book to that part of the\npublic that will be interested in its contents. Therefore, the title\nshould be effective, and since it is essentially short, it should be\nconcise, laconic, pregnant, and if possible express the contents in a\nword. Therefore a title that is prolix, or means nothing at all, or that\nis indirect or ambiguous, is bad; so is one that is false and\nmisleading: this last may prepare for the book the same fate as that\nwhich awaits a wrongly addressed letter. The worst titles are those that\nare stolen, such titles that is to say that other books already bear;\nfor in the first place they are a plagiarism, and in the second a most\nconvincing proof of an absolute want of originality. A man who has not\nenough originality to think out a new title for his book will be much\nless capable of giving it new contents. Akin to these are those titles\nwhich have been imitated, in other words, half stolen; for instance, a\nlong time after I had written \"On Will in Nature,\" Oersted wrote \"On\nMind in Nature.\"\n*       *       *       *       *\nA book can never be anything more than the impression of its author's\nthoughts. The value of these thoughts lies either in the _matter about\nwhich_ he has thought, or in the _form_ in which he develops his\nmatter--that is to say, _what_ he has thought about it.\nThe matter of books is very various, as also are the merits conferred on\nbooks on account of their matter. All matter that is the outcome of\nexperience, in other words everything that is founded on fact, whether\nit be historical or physical, taken by itself and in its widest sense,\nis included in the term matter. It is the _motif_ that gives its\npeculiar character to the book, so that a book can be important whoever\nthe author may have been; while with form the peculiar character of a\nbook rests with the author of it. The subjects may be of such a nature\nas to be accessible and well known to everybody; but the form in which\nthey are expounded, _what_ has been thought about them, gives the book\nits value, and this depends upon the author. Therefore if a book, from\nthis point of view, is excellent and without a rival, so also is its\nauthor. From this it follows that the merit of a writer worth reading is\nall the greater the less he is dependent on matter--and the better known\nand worn out this matter, the greater will be his merit. The three great\nGrecian tragedians, for instance, all worked at the same subject.\nSo that when a book becomes famous one should carefully distinguish\nwhether it is so on account of its matter or its form.\nQuite ordinary and shallow men are able to produce books of very great\nimportance because of their _matter_, which was accessible to them\nalone. Take, for instance, books which give descriptions of foreign\ncountries, rare natural phenomena, experiments that have been made,\nhistorical events of which they were witnesses, or have spent both time\nand trouble in inquiring into and specially studying the authorities for\nthem.\nOn the other hand, it is on _form_ that we are dependent, where the\nmatter is accessible to every one or very well known; and it is what has\nbeen thought about the matter that will give any value to the\nachievement; it will only be an eminent man who will be able to write\nanything that is worth reading. For the others will only think what is\npossible for every other man to think. They give the impress of their\nown mind; but every one already possesses the original of this\nimpression.\nHowever, the public is very much more interested in matter than in form,\nand it is for this very reason that it is behindhand in any high degree\nof culture. It is most laughable the way the public reveals its liking\nfor matter in poetic works; it carefully investigates the real events or\npersonal circumstances of the poet's life which served to give the\n_motif_ of his works; nay, finally, it finds these more interesting than\nthe works themselves; it reads more about Goethe than what has been\nwritten by Goethe, and industriously studies the legend of Faust in\npreference to Goethe's _Faust_ itself. And when B\u00fcrger said that \"people\nwould make learned expositions as to who Leonora really was,\" we see\nthis literally fulfilled in Goethe's case, for we now have many learned\nexpositions on Faust and the Faust legend. They are and will remain of a\npurely material character. This preference for matter to form is the\nsame as a man ignoring the shape and painting of a fine Etruscan vase in\norder to make a chemical examination of the clay and colours of which it\nis made. The attempt to be effective by means of the matter used,\nthereby ministering to this evil propensity of the public, is absolutely\nto be censured in branches of writing where the merit must lie expressly\nin the form; as, for instance, in poetical writing. However, there are\nnumerous bad dramatic authors striving to fill the theatre by means of\nthe matter they are treating. For instance, they place on the stage any\nkind of celebrated man, however stripped of dramatic incidents his life\nmay have been, nay, sometimes without waiting until the persons who\nappear with him are dead.\nThe distinction between matter and form, of which I am here speaking, is\ntrue also in regard to conversation. It is chiefly intelligence,\njudgment, wit, and vivacity that enable a man to converse; they give\nform to the conversation. However, the _matter_ of the conversation must\nsoon come into notice--in other words, _that_ about which one can talk\nto the man, namely, his knowledge. If this is very small, it will only\nbe his possessing the above-named formal qualities in a quite\nexceptionally high degree that will make his conversation of any value,\nfor his matter will be restricted to things concerning humanity and\nnature, which are known generally. It is just the reverse if a man is\nwanting in these formal qualities, but has, on the other hand, knowledge\nof such a kind that it lends value to his conversation; this value,\nhowever, will then entirely rest on the matter of his conversation, for,\naccording to the Spanish proverb, _mas sabe el necio en su casa, que el\nsabio en la agena_.\nA thought only really lives until it has reached the boundary line of\nwords; it then becomes petrified and dies immediately; yet it is as\neverlasting as the fossilised animals and plants of former ages. Its\nexistence, which is really momentary, may be compared to a crystal the\ninstant it becomes crystallised.\nAs soon as a thought has found words it no longer exists in us or is\nserious in its deepest sense.\nWhen it begins to exist for others it ceases to live in us; just as a\nchild frees itself from its mother when it comes into existence. The\npoet has also said:\n\"Ihr m\u00fcsst mich nicht durch Widerspruch verwirren!\n_Sobald man spricht, beginnt man schon zu irren_.\"\nThe pen is to thought what the stick is to walking, but one walks most\neasily without a stick, and thinks most perfectly when no pen is at\nhand. It is only when a man begins to get old that he likes to make use\nof a stick and his pen.\nA hypothesis that has once gained a position in the mind, or been born\nin it, leads a life resembling that of an organism, in so far as it\nreceives from the outer world matter only that is advantageous and\nhomogeneous to it; on the other hand, matter that is harmful and\nheterogeneous to it is either rejected, or if it must be received, cast\noff again entirely.\nAbstract and indefinite terms should be employed in satire only as they\nare in algebra, in place of concrete and specified quantities. Moreover,\nit should be used as sparingly as the dissecting knife on the body of a\nliving man. At the risk of forfeiting his life it is an unsafe\nexperiment.\nFor a work to become _immortal_ it must possess so many excellences that\nit will not be easy to find a man who understands and values them _all_;\nso that there will be in all ages men who recognise and appreciate some\nof these excellences; by this means the credit of the work will be\nretained throughout the long course of centuries and ever-changing\ninterests, for, as it is appreciated first in this sense, then in that,\nthe interest is never exhausted.\nAn author like this, in other words, an author who has a claim to live\non in posterity, can only be a man who seeks in vain his like among his\ncontemporaries over the wide world, his marked distinction making him a\nstriking contrast to every one else. Even if he existed through several\ngenerations, like the wandering Jew, he would still occupy the same\nposition; in short, he would be, as Ariosto has put it, _lo fece natura,\ne poi ruppe lo stampo_. If this were not so, one would not be able to\nunderstand why his thoughts should not perish like those of other men.\nIn almost every age, whether it be in literature or art, we find that if\na thoroughly wrong idea, or a fashion, or a manner is in vogue, it is\nadmired. Those of ordinary intelligence trouble themselves inordinately\nto acquire it and put it in practice. An intelligent man sees through it\nand despises it, consequently he remains out of the fashion. Some years\nlater the public sees through it and takes the sham for what it is\nworth; it now laughs at it, and the much-admired colour of all these\nworks of fashion falls off like the plaster from a badly-built wall: and\nthey are in the same dilapidated condition. We should be glad and not\nsorry when a fundamentally wrong notion of which we have been secretly\nconscious for a long time finally gains a footing and is proclaimed both\nloudly and openly. The falseness of it will soon be felt and eventually\nproclaimed equally loudly and openly. It is as if an abscess had burst.\nThe man who publishes and edits an article written by an anonymous\ncritic should be held as immediately responsible for it as if he had\nwritten it himself; just as one holds a manager responsible for bad work\ndone by his workmen. In this way the fellow would be treated as he\ndeserves to be--namely, without any ceremony.\nAn anonymous writer is a literary fraud against whom one should\nimmediately cry out, \"Wretch, if you do not wish to admit what it is you\nsay against other people, hold your slanderous tongue.\"\nAn anonymous criticism carries no more weight than an anonymous letter,\nand should therefore be looked upon with equal mistrust. Or do we wish\nto accept the assumed name of a man, who in reality represents a\n_soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme_, as a guarantee for the veracity of his friends?\nThe little honesty that exists among authors is discernible in the\nunconscionable way they misquote from the writings of others. I find\nwhole passages in my works wrongly quoted, and it is only in my\nappendix, which is absolutely lucid, that an exception is made. The\nmisquotation is frequently due to carelessness, the pen of such people\nhas been used to write down such trivial and banal phrases that it goes\non writing them out of force of habit. Sometimes the misquotation is due\nto impertinence on the part of some one who wants to improve upon my\nwork; but a bad motive only too often prompts the misquotation--it is\nthen horrid baseness and roguery, and, like a man who commits forgery,\nhe loses the character for being an honest man for ever.\nStyle is the physiognomy of the mind. It is a more reliable key to\ncharacter than the physiognomy of the body. To imitate another person's\nstyle is like wearing a mask. However fine the mask, it soon becomes\ninsipid and intolerable because it is without life; so that even the\nugliest living face is better. Therefore authors who write in Latin and\nimitate the style of the old writers essentially wear a mask; one\ncertainly hears what they say, but one cannot watch their\nphysiognomy--that is to say their style. One observes, however, the\nstyle in the Latin writings of men _who think for themselves_, those who\nhave not deigned to imitate, as, for instance, Scotus Erigena, Petrarch,\nBacon, Descartes, Spinoza, etc.\nAffectation in style is like making grimaces. The language in which a\nman writes is the physiognomy of his nation; it establishes a great many\ndifferences, beginning from the language of the Greeks down to that of\nthe Caribbean islanders.\nWe should seek for the faults in the style of another author's works, so\nthat we may avoid committing the same in our own.\nIn order to get a provisional estimate of the value of an author's\nproductions it is not exactly necessary to know the matter on which he\nhas thought or what it is he has thought about it,--this would compel\none to read the whole of his works,--but it will be sufficient to know\n_how_ he has thought. His _style_ is an exact expression of _how_ he has\nthought, of the essential state and general _quality_ of his thoughts.\nIt shows the _formal_ nature--which must always remain the same--of all\nthe thoughts of a man, whatever the subject on which he has thought or\nwhat it is he has said about it. It is the dough out of which all his\nideas are kneaded, however various they may be. When Eulenspiegel was\nasked by a man how long he would have to walk before reaching the next\nplace, and gave the apparently absurd answer _Walk_, his intention was\nto judge from the man's walking how far he would go in a given time. And\nso it is when I have read a few pages of an author, I know about how far\nhe can help me.\nIn the secret consciousness that this is the condition of things, every\nmediocre writer tries to mask his own natural style. This instantly\nnecessitates his giving up all idea of being _na\u00efve_, a privilege which\nbelongs to superior minds sensible of their superiority, and therefore\nsure of themselves. For instance, it is absolutely impossible for men of\nordinary intelligence to make up their minds to write as they think;\nthey resent the idea of their work looking too simple. It would always\nbe of some value, however. If they would only go honestly to work and in\na simple way express the few and ordinary ideas they have really\nthought, they would be readable and even instructive in their own\nsphere. But instead of that they try to appear to have thought much more\ndeeply than is the case. The result is, they put what they have to say\ninto forced and involved language, create new words and prolix periods\nwhich go round the thought and cover it up. They hesitate between the\ntwo attempts of communicating the thought and of concealing it. They\nwant to make it look grand so that it has the appearance of being\nlearned and profound, thereby giving one the idea that there is much\nmore in it than one perceives at the moment. Accordingly, they sometimes\nput down their thoughts in bits, in short, equivocal, and paradoxical\nsentences which appear to mean much more than they say (a splendid\nexample of this kind of writing is furnished by Schelling's treatises on\nNatural Philosophy); sometimes they express their thoughts in a crowd of\nwords and the most intolerable diffuseness, as if it were necessary to\nmake a sensation in order to make the profound meaning of their phrases\nintelligible--while it is quite a simple idea if not a trivial one\n(examples without number are supplied in Fichte's popular works and in\nthe philosophical pamphlets of a hundred other miserable blockheads that\nare not worth mentioning), or else they endeavour to use a certain style\nin writing which it has pleased them to adopt--for example, a style that\nis so thoroughly _Kat' e'xochae'u_ profound and scientific, where one is\ntortured to death by the narcotic effect of long-spun periods that are\nvoid of all thought (examples of this are specially supplied by those\nmost impertinent of all mortals, the Hegelians in their Hegel newspaper\ncommonly known as _Jahrb\u00fccher der wissenschaftlichen Literatur)_; or\nagain, they aim at an intellectual style where it seems then as if they\nwish to go crazy, and so on. All such efforts whereby they try to\npostpone the _nascetur ridiculus mus_ make it frequently difficult to\nunderstand what they really mean. Moreover, they write down words, nay,\nwhole periods, which mean nothing in themselves, in the hope, however,\nthat some one else will understand something from them. Nothing else is\nat the bottom of all such endeavours but the inexhaustible attempt which\nis always venturing on new paths, to sell words for thoughts, and by\nmeans of new expressions, or expressions used in a new sense, turns of\nphrases and combinations of all kinds, to produce the appearance of\nintellect in order to compensate for the want of it which is so\npainfully felt. It is amusing to see how, with this aim in view, first\nthis mannerism and then that is tried; these they intend to represent\nthe mask of intellect: this mask may possibly deceive the inexperienced\nfor a while, until it is recognised as being nothing but a dead mask,\nwhen it is laughed at and exchanged for another.\nWe find a writer of this kind sometimes writing in a dithyrambic style,\nas if he were intoxicated; at other times, nay, on the very next page,\nhe will be high-sounding, severe, and deeply learned, prolix to the last\ndegree of dulness, and cutting everything very small, like the late\nChristian Wolf, only in a modern garment. The mask of unintelligibility\nholds out the longest; this is only in Germany, however, where it was\nintroduced by Fichte, perfected by Schelling, and attained its highest\nclimax finally in Hegel, always with the happiest results. And yet\nnothing is easier than to write so that no one can understand; on the\nother hand, nothing is more difficult than to express learned ideas so\nthat every one must understand them. All the arts I have cited above are\nsuperfluous if the writer really possesses any intellect, for it allows\na man to show himself as he is and verifies for all time what Horace\nsaid: _Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons_.\nBut this class of authors is like certain workers in metal, who try a\nhundred different compositions to take the place of gold, which is the\nonly metal that can never have a substitute. On the contrary, there is\nnothing an author should guard against more than the apparent endeavour\nto show more intellect than he has; because this rouses the suspicion in\nthe reader that he has very little, since a man always affects\nsomething, be its nature what it may, that he does not really possess.\nAnd this is why it is praise to an author to call him na\u00efve, for it\nsignifies that he may show himself as he is. In general, na\u00efvet\u00e9\nattracts, while anything that is unnatural everywhere repels. We also\nfind that every true thinker endeavours to express his thoughts as\npurely, clearly, definitely, and concisely as ever possible. This is why\nsimplicity has always been looked upon as a token, not only of truth,\nbut also of genius. Style receives its beauty from the thought\nexpressed, while with those writers who only pretend to think it is\ntheir thoughts that are said to be fine because of their style. Style is\nmerely the silhouette of thought; and to write in a vague or bad style\nmeans a stupid or confused mind.\nHence, the first rule--nay, this in itself is almost sufficient for a\ngood style--is this, _that the author should have something to say_. Ah!\nthis implies a great deal. The neglect of this rule is a fundamental\ncharacteristic of the philosophical, and generally speaking of all the\nreflective authors in Germany, especially since the time of Fichte. It\nis obvious that all these writers wish _to appear_ to have something to\nsay, while they have nothing to say. This mannerism was introduced by\nthe pseudo-philosophers of the Universities and may be discerned\neverywhere, even among the first literary notabilities of the age. It is\nthe mother of that forced and vague style which seems to have two, nay,\nmany meanings, as well as of that prolix and ponderous style, _le stile\nempes\u00e9_; and of that no less useless bombastic style, and finally of\nthat mode of concealing the most awful poverty of thought under a babble\nof inexhaustible chatter that resembles a clacking mill and is just as\nstupefying: one may read for hours together without getting hold of a\nsingle clearly defined and definite idea. The _Halleschen_, afterwards\ncalled the _Deutschen Jahrb\u00fccher_, furnishes almost throughout excellent\nexamples of this style of writing. The Germans, by the way, from force\nof habit read page after page of all kinds of such verbiage without\ngetting any definite idea of what the author really means: they think it\nall very proper and do not discover that he is writing merely for the\nsake of writing. On the other hand, a good author who is rich in ideas\nsoon gains the reader's credit of having really and truly _something to\nsay_; and this gives the intelligent reader patience to follow him\nattentively. An author of this kind will always express himself in the\nsimplest and most direct manner, for the very reason that he really has\nsomething to say; because he wishes to awaken in the reader the same\nidea he has in his own mind and no other. Accordingly he will be able to\nsay with Boileau--\n\"Ma pens\u00e9e au grand jour partout s'offre et s'expose,\nEt mon vers, bien ou mal, dit toujours quelque chose;\"\nwhile of those previously described writers it may be said, in the words\nof the same poet, _et qui parlant beaucoup ne disent jamais rien_. It is\nalso a characteristic of such writers to avoid, if it is possible,\nexpressing themselves _definitely_, so that they may be always able in\ncase of need to get out of a difficulty; this is why they always choose\nthe more _abstract_ expressions: while people of intellect choose the\nmore _concrete_; because the latter bring the matter closer to view,\nwhich is the source of all evidence. This preference for abstract\nexpressions may be confirmed by numerous examples: a specially\nridiculous example is the following. Throughout German literature of the\nlast ten years we find \"to condition\" almost everywhere used in place of\n\"to cause\" or \"to effect.\" Since it is more abstract and indefinite it\nsays less than it implies, and consequently leaves a little back door\nopen to please those whose secret consciousness of their own incapacity\ninspires them with a continual fear of all _definite_ expressions. While\nwith other people it is merely the effect of that national tendency to\nimmediately imitate everything that is stupid in literature and wicked\nin life; this is shown in either case by the quick way in which it\nspreads. The Englishman depends on his own judgment both in what he\nwrites and what he does, but this applies less to the German than to any\nother nation. In consequence of the state of things referred to, the\nwords \"to cause\" and \"to effect\" have almost entirely disappeared from\nthe literature of the last ten years, and people everywhere talk of \"to\ncondition.\" The fact is worth mentioning because it is\ncharacteristically ridiculous. Everyday authors are only half conscious\nwhen they write, a fact which accounts for their want of intellect and\nthe tediousness of their writings; they do not really themselves\nunderstand the meaning of their own words, because they take ready-made\nwords and learn them. Hence they combine whole phrases more than\nwords--_phrases banales_. This accounts for that obviously\ncharacteristic want of clearly defined thought; in fact, they lack the\ndie that stamps their thoughts, they have no clear thought of their own;\nin place of it we find an indefinite, obscure interweaving of words,\ncurrent phrases, worn-out terms of speech, and fashionable expressions.\nThe result is that their foggy kind of writing is like print that has\nbeen done with old type. On the other hand, intelligent people _really_\nspeak to us in their writings, and this is why they are able to both\nmove and entertain us. It is only intelligent writers who place\nindividual words together with a full consciousness of their use and\nselect them with deliberation. Hence their style of writing bears the\nsame relation to that of those authors described above, as a picture\nthat is really painted does to one that has been executed with stencil.\nIn the first instance every word, just as every stroke of the brush, has\nsome special significance, while in the other everything is done\nmechanically. The same distinction may be observed in music. For it is\nthe omnipresence of intellect that always and everywhere characterises\nthe works of the genius; and analogous to this is Lichtenberg's\nobservation, namely, that Garrick's soul was omnipresent in all the\nmuscles of his body. With regard to the tediousness of the writings\nreferred to above, it is to be observed in general that there are two\nkinds of tediousness--an objective and a subjective. The _objective_\nform of tediousness springs from the deficiency of which we have been\nspeaking--that is to say, where the author has no perfectly clear\nthought or knowledge to communicate. For if a writer possesses any clear\nthought or knowledge it will be his aim to communicate it, and he will\nwork with this end in view; consequently the ideas he furnishes are\neverywhere clearly defined, so that he is neither diffuse, unmeaning,\nnor confused, and consequently not tedious. Even if his fundamental idea\nis wrong, yet in such a case it will be clearly thought out and well\npondered; in other words, it is at least formally correct, and the\nwriting is always of some value. While, for the same reason, a work that\nis objectively _tedious_ is at all times without value. Again,\n_subjective_ tediousness is merely relative: this is because the reader\nis not interested in the subject of the work, and that what he takes an\ninterest in is of a very limited nature. The most excellent work may\ntherefore be tedious subjectively to this or that person, just as, _vice\nvers\ufffd_, the worst work may be subjectively diverting to this or that\nperson: because he is interested in either the subject or the writer of\nthe book.\nIt would be of general service to German authors if they discerned that\nwhile a man should, if possible, think like a great mind, he should\nspeak the same language as every other person. Men should use common\nwords to say uncommon things, but they do the reverse. We find them\ntrying to envelop trivial ideas in grand words and to dress their very\nordinary thoughts in the most extraordinary expressions and the most\noutlandish, artificial, and rarest phrases. Their sentences perpetually\nstalk about on stilts. With regard to their delight in bombast, and to\ntheir writing generally in a grand, puffed-up, unreal, hyperbolical, and\nacrobatic style, their prototype is Pistol, who was once impatiently\nrequested by Falstaff, his friend, to \"say what you have to say, _like a\nman of this world_!\"[5]\nThere is no expression in the German language exactly corresponding to\n_stile empes\u00e9_; but the thing itself is all the more prevalent. When\ncombined with unnaturalness it is in works what affected gravity,\ngrandness, and unnaturalness are in social intercourse; and it is just\nas intolerable. Poverty of intellect is fond of wearing this dress; just\nas stupid people in everyday life are fond of assuming gravity and\nformality.\nA man who writes in this _prezi\u00f6s_ style is like a person who dresses\nhimself up to avoid being mistaken for or confounded with the mob; a\ndanger which a _gentleman_, even in his worst clothes, does not run.\nHence just as a plebeian is recognised by a certain display in his dress\nand his _tir\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre \u00e9pingles_, so is an ordinary writer recognised by\nhis style.\nIf a man has something to say that is worth saying, he need not envelop\nit in affected expressions, involved phrases, and enigmatical\ninnuendoes; but he may rest assured that by expressing himself in a\nsimple, clear, and na\u00efve manner he will not fail to produce the right\neffect. A man who makes use of such artifices as have been alluded to\nbetrays his poverty of ideas, mind, and knowledge.\nNevertheless, it is a mistake to attempt to write exactly as one speaks.\nEvery style of writing should bear a certain trace of relationship with\nthe monumental style, which is, indeed, the ancestor of all styles; so\nthat to write as one speaks is just as faulty as to do the reverse, that\nis to say, to try and speak as one writes. This makes the author\npedantic, and at the same time difficult to understand.\nObscurity and vagueness of expression are at all times and everywhere a\nvery bad sign. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred they arise from\nvagueness of thought, which, in its turn, is almost always fundamentally\ndiscordant, inconsistent, and therefore wrong. When a right thought\nsprings up in the mind it strives after clearness of expression, and it\nsoon attains it, for clear thought easily finds its appropriate\nexpression. A man who is capable of thinking can express himself at all\ntimes in clear, comprehensible, and unambiguous words. Those writers who\nconstruct difficult, obscure, involved, and ambiguous phrases most\ncertainly do not rightly know what it is they wish to say: they have\nonly a dull consciousness of it, which is still struggling to put itself\ninto thought; they also often wish to conceal from themselves and other\npeople that in reality they have nothing to say. Like Fichte, Schelling,\nand Hegel, they wish to appear to know what they do not know, to think\nwhat they do not think, and to say what they do not say.\nWill a man, then, who has something real to impart endeavour to say it\nin a clear or an indistinct way? Quintilian has already said, _plerumque\naccidit ut faciliora sint ad intelligendum et lucidiora multo, quae a\ndoctissimo quoque dicuntur.... Erit ergo etiam obscurior, quo quisque\ndeterior_.\nA man's way of expressing himself should not be _enigmatical_, but he\nshould know whether he has something to say or whether he has not. It is\nan uncertainty of expression which makes German writers so dull. The\nonly exceptional cases are those where a man wishes to express something\nthat is in some respect of an illicit nature. As anything that is\nfar-fetched generally produces the reverse of what the writer has aimed\nat, so do words serve to make thought comprehensible; but only up to a\ncertain point. If words are piled up beyond this point they make the\nthought that is being communicated more and more obscure. To hit that\npoint is the problem of style and a matter of discernment; for every\nsuperfluous word prevents its purpose being carried out. Voltaire means\nthis when he says: _l'adjectif est l'ennemi du substantif_. (But, truly,\nmany authors try to hide their poverty of thought under a superfluity of\nwords.)\nAccordingly, all prolixity and all binding together of unmeaning\nobservations that are not worth reading should be avoided. A writer must\nbe sparing with the reader's time, concentration, and patience; in this\nway he makes him believe that what he has before him is worth his\ncareful reading, and will repay the trouble he has spent upon it. It is\nalways better to leave out something that is good than to write down\nsomething that is not worth saying. Hesiod's \u03c0\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03c5 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2[6]\nfinds its right application. In fact, not to say everything! _Le secret\npour \u00eatre ennuyeux, c'est de tout dire_. Therefore, if possible, the\nquintessence only! the chief matter only! nothing that the reader would\nthink for himself. The use of many words in order to express little\nthought is everywhere the infallible sign of mediocrity; while to clothe\nmuch thought in a few words is the infallible sign of distinguished\nminds.\nTruth that is naked is the most beautiful, and the simpler its\nexpression the deeper is the impression it makes; this is partly because\nit gets unobstructed hold of the hearer's mind without his being\ndistracted by secondary thoughts, and partly because he feels that here\nhe is not being corrupted or deceived by the arts of rhetoric, but that\nthe whole effect is got from the thing itself. For instance, what\ndeclamation on the emptiness of human existence could be more impressive\nthan Job's: _Homo, natus de muliere, brevi vivit tempore, repletus\nmultis miseriis, qui, tanquam flos, egreditur et conteritur, et fugit\nvelut umbra_. It is for this very reason that the na\u00efve poetry of Goethe\nis so incomparably greater than the rhetorical of Schiller. This is also\nwhy many folk-songs have so great an effect upon us. An author should\nguard against using all unnecessary rhetorical adornment, all useless\namplification, and in general, just as in architecture he should guard\nagainst an excess of decoration, all superfluity of expression--in other\nwords, he must aim at _chastity_ of style. Everything that is redundant\nhas a harmful effect. The law of simplicity and na\u00efvet\u00e9 applies to all\nfine art, for it is compatible with what is most sublime.\nTrue brevity of expression consists in a man only saying what is worth\nsaying, while avoiding all diffuse explanations of things which every\none can think out for himself; that is, it consists in his correctly\ndistinguishing between what is necessary and what is superfluous. On the\nother hand, one should never sacrifice clearness, to say nothing of\ngrammar, for the sake of being brief. To impoverish the expression of a\nthought, or to obscure or spoil the meaning of a period for the sake of\nusing fewer words shows a lamentable want of judgment. And this is\nprecisely what that false brevity nowadays in vogue is trying to do, for\nwriters not only leave out words that are to the purpose, but even\ngrammatical and logical essentials.[7]\n_Subjectivity_, which is an error of style in German literature, is,\nthrough the deteriorated condition of literature and neglect of old\nlanguages, becoming more common. By _subjectivity_ I mean when a writer\nthinks it sufficient for himself to know what he means and wants to say,\nand it is left to the reader to discover what is meant. Without\ntroubling himself about his reader, he writes as if he were holding a\nmonologue; whereas it should be a dialogue, and, moreover, a dialogue in\nwhich he must express himself all the more clearly as the questions of\nthe reader cannot be heard. And it is for this very reason that style\nshould not be subjective but objective, and for it to be objective the\nwords must be written in such a way as to directly compel the reader to\nthink precisely the same as the author thought. This will only be the\ncase when the author has borne in mind that thoughts, inasmuch as they\nfollow the law of gravity, pass more easily from head to paper than from\npaper to head. Therefore the journey from paper to head must be helped\nby every means at his command. When he does this his words have a purely\nobjective effect, like that of a completed oil painting; while the\nsubjective style is not much more certain in its effect than spots on\nthe wall, and it is only the man whose fantasy is accidentally aroused\nby them that sees figures; other people only see blurs. The difference\nreferred to applies to every style of writing as a whole, and it is also\noften met with in particular instances; for example, I read in a book\nthat has just been published: _I have not written to increase the number\nof existing books_. This means exactly the opposite of what the writer\nhad in view, and is nonsense into the bargain.\nA man who writes carelessly at once proves that he himself puts no great\nvalue on his own thoughts. For it is only by being convinced of the\ntruth and importance of our thoughts that there arises in us the\ninspiration necessary for the inexhaustible patience to discover the\nclearest, finest, and most powerful expression for them; just as one\nputs holy relics or priceless works of art in silvern or golden\nreceptacles. It was for this reason that the old writers--whose\nthoughts, expressed in their own words, have lasted for thousands of\nyears and hence bear the honoured title of classics--wrote with\nuniversal care. Plato, indeed, is said to have written the introduction\nto his _Republic_ seven times with different modifications. On the other\nhand, the Germans are conspicuous above all other nations for neglect of\nstyle in writing, as they are for neglect of dress, both kinds of\nslovenliness which have their source in the German national character.\nJust as neglect of dress betrays contempt for the society in which a man\nmoves, so does a hasty, careless, and bad style show shocking disrespect\nfor the reader, who then rightly punishes it by not reading the book.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[5] Schopenhauer here gives an example of this bombastic style which\nwould be of little interest to English readers.--TRANSLATOR.\n[6] _Opera et dies_, v. 40.\n[7] Schopenhauer here at length points out various common errors in the\nwriting and speaking of German which would lose significance in a\ntranslation.--TR.\nON NOISE.\nKant has written a treatise on _The Vital Powers_; but I should like to\nwrite a dirge on them, since their lavish use in the form of knocking,\nhammering, and tumbling things about has made the whole of my life a\ndaily torment. Certainly there are people, nay, very many, who will\nsmile at this, because they are not sensitive to noise; it is precisely\nthese people, however, who are not sensitive to argument, thought,\npoetry or art, in short, to any kind of intellectual impression: a fact\nto be assigned to the coarse quality and strong texture of their brain\ntissues. On the other hand, in the biographies or in other records of\nthe personal utterances of almost all great writers, I find complaints\nof the pain that noise has occasioned to intellectual men. For example,\nin the case of Kant, Goethe, Lichtenberg, Jean Paul; and indeed when no\nmention is made of the matter it is merely because the context did not\nlead up to it. I should explain the subject we are treating in this way:\nIf a big diamond is cut up into pieces, it immediately loses its value\nas a whole; or if an army is scattered or divided into small bodies, it\nloses all its power; and in the same way a great intellect has no more\npower than an ordinary one as soon as it is interrupted, disturbed,\ndistracted, or diverted; for its superiority entails that it\nconcentrates all its strength on one point and object, just as a concave\nmirror concentrates all the rays of light thrown upon it. Noisy\ninterruption prevents this concentration. This is why the most eminent\nintellects have always been strongly averse to any kind of disturbance,\ninterruption and distraction, and above everything to that violent\ninterruption which is caused by noise; other people do not take any\nparticular notice of this sort of thing. The most intelligent of all the\nEuropean nations has called \"Never interrupt\" the eleventh commandment.\nBut noise is the most impertinent of all interruptions, for it not only\ninterrupts our own thoughts but disperses them. Where, however, there is\nnothing to interrupt, noise naturally will not be felt particularly.\nSometimes a trifling but incessant noise torments and disturbs me for a\ntime, and before I become distinctly conscious of it I feel it merely as\nthe effort of thinking becomes more difficult, just as I should feel a\nweight on my foot; then I realise what it is.\nBut to pass from _genus_ to _species_, the truly infernal cracking of\nwhips in the narrow resounding streets of a town must be denounced as\nthe most unwarrantable and disgraceful of all noises. It deprives life\nof all peace and sensibility. Nothing gives me so clear a grasp of the\nstupidity and thoughtlessness of mankind as the tolerance of the\ncracking of whips. This sudden, sharp crack which paralyses the brain,\ndestroys all meditation, and murders thought, must cause pain to any one\nwho has anything like an idea in his head. Hence every crack must\ndisturb a hundred people applying their minds to some activity, however\ntrivial it may be; while it disjoints and renders painful the\nmeditations of the thinker; just like the executioner's axe when it\nsevers the head from the body. No sound cuts so sharply into the brain\nas this cursed cracking of whips; one feels the prick of the whip-cord\nin one's brain, which is affected in the same way as the _mimosa pudica_\nis by touch, and which lasts the same length of time. With all respect\nfor the most holy doctrine of utility, I do not see why a fellow who is\nremoving a load of sand or manure should obtain the privilege of killing\nin the bud the thoughts that are springing up in the heads of about ten\nthousand people successively. (He is only half-an-hour on the road.)\nHammering, the barking of dogs, and the screaming of children are\nabominable; but it is _only_ the cracking of a whip that is the true\nmurderer of thought. Its object is to destroy every favourable moment\nthat one now and then may have for reflection. If there were no other\nmeans of urging on an animal than by making this most disgraceful of all\nnoises, one would forgive its existence. But it is quite the contrary:\nthis cursed cracking of whips is not only unnecessary but even useless.\nThe effect that it is intended to have on the horse mentally becomes\nquite blunted and ineffective; since the constant abuse of it has\naccustomed the horse to the crack, he does not quicken his pace for it.\nThis is especially noticeable in the unceasing crack of the whip which\ncomes from an empty vehicle as it is being driven at its slowest rate to\npick up a fare. The slightest touch with the whip would be more\neffective. Allowing, however, that it were absolutely necessary to\nremind the horse of the presence of the whip by continually cracking it,\na crack that made one hundredth part of the noise would be sufficient.\nIt is well known that animals in regard to hearing and seeing notice the\nslightest indications, even indications that are scarcely perceptible to\nourselves. Trained dogs and canary birds furnish astonishing examples of\nthis. Accordingly, this cracking of whips must be regarded as something\npurely wanton; nay, as an impudent defiance, on the part of those who\nwork with their hands, offered to those who work with their heads. That\nsuch infamy is endured in a town is a piece of barbarity and injustice,\nthe more so as it could be easily removed by a police notice requiring\nevery whip cord to have a knot at the end of it. It would do no harm to\ndraw the proletariat's attention to the classes above him who work with\ntheir heads; for he has unbounded fear of any kind of head work. A\nfellow who rides through the narrow streets of a populous town with\nunemployed post-horses or cart-horses, unceasingly cracking with all his\nstrength a whip several yards long, instantly deserves to dismount and\nreceive five really good blows with a stick. If all the philanthropists\nin the world, together with all the legislators, met in order to bring\nforward their reasons for the total abolition of corporal punishment, I\nwould not be persuaded to the contrary.\nBut we can see often enough something that is even still worse. I mean a\ncarter walking alone, and without any horses, through the streets\nincessantly cracking his whip. He has become so accustomed to the crack\nin consequence of its unwarrantable toleration. Since one looks after\none's body and all its needs in a most tender fashion, is the thinking\nmind to be the only thing that never experiences the slightest\nconsideration or protection, to say nothing of respect? Carters,\nsack-bearers (porters), messengers, and such-like, are the beasts of\nburden of humanity; they should be treated absolutely with justice,\nfairness, forbearance and care, but they ought not to be allowed to\nthwart the higher exertions of the human race by wantonly making a\nnoise. I should like to know how many great and splendid thoughts these\nwhips have cracked out of the world. If I had any authority, I should\nsoon produce in the heads of these carters an inseparable _nexus\nidearum_ between cracking a whip and receiving a whipping.\nLet us hope that those nations with more intelligence and refined\nfeelings will make a beginning, and then by force of example induce the\nGermans to do the same.[8] Meanwhile, hear what Thomas Hood says of them\n(_Up the Rhine)_: \"_For a musical people they are the most noisy I ever\nmet with_\" That they are so is not due to their being more prone to\nmaking a noise than other people, but to their insensibility, which\nsprings from obtuseness; they are not disturbed by it in reading or\nthinking, because they do not think; they only smoke, which is their\nsubstitute for thought. The general toleration of unnecessary noise, for\ninstance, of the clashing of doors, which is so extremely ill-mannered\nand vulgar, is a direct proof of the dulness and poverty of thought that\none meets with everywhere. In Germany it seems as though it were planned\nthat no one should think for noise; take the inane drumming that goes on\nas an instance. Finally, as far as the literature treated of in this\nchapter is concerned, I have only one work to recommend, but it is an\nexcellent one: I mean a poetical epistle in _terzo rimo_ by the famous\npainter Bronzino, entitled \"_De' Romori: a Messer Luca Martini_\" It\ndescribes fully and amusingly the torture to which one is put by the\nmany kinds of noises of a small Italian town. It is written in\ntragicomic style. This epistle is to be found in _Opere burlesche del\nBerni, Aretino ed altri,_ vol. ii. p. 258, apparently published in\nUtrecht in 1771.\nThe nature of our intellect is such that _ideas_ are said to spring by\nabstraction from _observations_, so that the latter are in existence\nbefore the former. If this is really what takes place, as is the case\nwith a man who has merely his own experience as his teacher and book, he\nknows quite well which of his observations belong to and are represented\nby each of his ideas; he is perfectly acquainted with both, and\naccordingly he treats everything correctly that comes before his notice.\nWe might call this the natural mode of education.\nOn the other hand, an artificial education is having one's head crammed\nfull of ideas, derived from hearing others talk, from learning and\nreading, before one has anything like an extensive knowledge of the\nworld as it is and as one sees it. The observations which produce all\nthese ideas are said to come later on with experience; but until then\nthese ideas are applied wrongly, and accordingly both things and men are\njudged wrongly, seen wrongly, and treated wrongly. And so it is that\neducation perverts the mind; and this is why, after a long spell of\nlearning and reading, we enter the world, in our youth, with views that\nare partly simple, partly perverted; consequently we comport ourselves\nwith an air of anxiety at one time, at another of presumption. This is\nbecause our head is full of ideas which we are now trying to make use\nof, but almost always apply wrongly. This is the result of \u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\n\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (putting the cart before the horse), since we are directly\nopposing the natural development of our mind by obtaining ideas first\nand observations last; for teachers, instead of developing in a boy his\nfaculties of discernment and judgment, and of thinking for himself,\nmerely strive to stuff his head full of other people's thoughts.\nSubsequently, all the opinions that have sprung from misapplied ideas\nhave to be rectified by a lengthy experience; and it is seldom that they\nare completely rectified. This is why so few men of learning have such\nsound common sense as is quite common among the illiterate.\n*       *       *       *       *\nFrom what has been said, the principal point in education is that _one's\nknowledge of the world begins at the right end;_ and the attainment of\nwhich might be designated as the aim of all education. But, as has been\npointed out, this depends principally on the observation of each thing\npreceding the idea one forms of it; further, that narrow ideas precede\nbroader; so that the whole of one's instruction is given in the order\nthat the ideas themselves during formation must have followed. But\ndirectly this order is not strictly adhered to, imperfect and\nsubsequently wrong ideas spring up; and finally there arises a perverted\nview of the world in keeping with the nature of the individual--a view\nsuch as almost every one holds for a long time, and most people to the\nend of their lives. If a man analyses his own character, he will find\nthat it was not until he reached a very ripe age, and in some cases\nquite unexpectedly, that he was able to rightly and clearly understand\nmany matters of a quite simple nature.\nPreviously, there had been an obscure point in his knowledge of the\nworld which had arisen through his omitting something in his early\neducation, whether he had been either artificially educated by men or\njust naturally by his own experience. Therefore one should try to find\nout the strictly natural course of knowledge, so that by keeping\nmethodically to it children may become acquainted with the affairs of\nthe world, without getting false ideas into their heads, which\nfrequently cannot be driven out again. In carrying this out, one must\nnext take care that children do not use words with which they connect no\nclear meaning. Even children have, as a rule, that unhappy tendency of\nbeing satisfied with words instead of wishing to understand things, and\nof learning words by heart, so that they may make use of them when they\nare in a difficulty. This tendency clings to them afterwards, so that\nthe knowledge of many learned men becomes mere verbosity.\nHowever, the principal thing must always be to let one's observations\nprecede one's ideas, and not the reverse as is usually and unfortunately\nthe case; which may be likened to a child coming into the world with its\nfeet foremost, or a rhyme begun before thinking of its reason. While the\nchild's mind has made a very few observations one inculcates it with\nideas and opinions, which are, strictly speaking, prejudices. His\nobservations and experience are developed through this ready-made\napparatus instead of his ideas being developed out of his own\nobservations. In viewing the world one sees many things from many sides,\nconsequently this is not such a short or quick way of learning as that\nwhich makes use of abstract ideas, and quickly comes to a decision about\neverything; therefore preconceived ideas will not be rectified until\nlate, or it may be they are never rectified. For, when a man's view\ncontradicts his ideas, he will reject at the outset what it renders\nevident as one-sided, nay, he will deny it and shut his eyes to it, so\nthat his preconceived ideas may remain unaffected. And so it happens\nthat many men go through life full of oddities, caprices, fancies, and\nprejudices, until they finally become fixed ideas. He has never\nattempted to abstract fundamental ideas from his own observations and\nexperience, because he has got everything ready-made from other people;\nand it is for this very reason that he and countless others are so\ninsipid and shallow. Instead of such a system, the natural system of\neducation should be employed in educating children. No idea should be\nimpregnated but what has come through the medium of observations, or at\nany rate been verified by them. A child would have fewer ideas, but they\nwould be well-grounded and correct. It would learn to measure things\naccording to its own standard and not according to another's. It would\nthen never acquire a thousand whims and prejudices which must be\neradicated by the greater part of subsequent experience and education.\nIts mind would henceforth be accustomed to thoroughness and clearness;\nthe child would rely on its own judgment, and be free from prejudices.\nAnd, in general, children should not get to know life, in any aspect\nwhatever, from the copy before they have learnt it from the original.\nInstead, therefore, of hastening to place mere books in their hands, one\nshould make them gradually acquainted with things and the circumstances\nof human life, and above everything one should take care to guide them\nto a clear grasp of reality, and to teach them to obtain their ideas\ndirectly from the real world, and to form them in keeping with it--but\nnot to get them from elsewhere, as from books, fables, or what others\nhave said--and then later to make use of such ready-made ideas in real\nlife. The result will be that their heads are full of chimeras and that\nsome will have a wrong comprehension of things, and others will\nfruitlessly endeavour to remodel the world according to those chimeras,\nand so get on to wrong paths both in theory and practice. For it is\nincredible how much harm is done by false notions which have been\nimplanted early in life, only to develop later on into prejudices; the\nlater education which we get from the world and real life must be\nemployed in eradicating these early ideas. And this is why, as is\nrelated by Diogenes Laertius, Antisthenes gave the following answer:\n\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ad\u03c6\u03b7, \"\u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd.\"\n(_Interrogatus quaenam esset disciplina maxime necessaria, Mala, inquit,\ndediscere_.)\n*       *       *       *       *\nChildren should be kept from all kinds of instruction that may make\nerrors possible until their sixteenth year, that is to say, from\nphilosophy, religion, and general views of every description; because it\nis the errors that are acquired in early days that remain, as a rule,\nineradicable, and because the faculty of judgment is the last to arrive\nat maturity. They should only be interested in such things that make\nerrors impossible, such as mathematics, in things which are not very\ndangerous, such as languages, natural science, history, and so forth; in\ngeneral, the branches of knowledge which are to be taken up at any age\nmust be within reach of the intellect at that age and perfectly\ncomprehensible to it. Childhood and youth are the time for collecting\ndata and getting to know specially and thoroughly individual and\nparticular things. On the other hand, all judgment of a general nature\nmust at that time be suspended, and final explanations left alone. One\nshould leave the faculty of judgment alone, as it only comes with\nmaturity and experience, and also take care that one does not anticipate\nit by inculcating prejudice, when it will be crippled for ever.\nOn the contrary, the memory is to be specially exercised, as it has its\ngreatest strength and tenacity in youth; however, what has to be\nretained must be chosen with the most careful and scrupulous\nconsideration. For as it is what we have learnt well in our youth that\nlasts, we should take the greatest possible advantage of this precious\ngift. If we picture to ourselves how deeply engraven on our memory the\npeople are whom we knew during the first twelve years of our life, and\nhow indelibly imprinted are also the events of that time, and most of\nthe things that we then experienced, heard, or learnt, the idea of\nbasing education on this susceptibility and tenacity of the youthful\nmind will seem natural; in that the mind receives its impressions\naccording to a strict method and a regular system. But because the years\nof youth that are assigned to man are only few, and the capacity for\nremembering, in general, is always limited (and still more so the\ncapacity for remembering of the individual), everything depends on the\nmemory being filled with what is most essential and important in any\ndepartment of knowledge, to the exclusion of everything else. This\nselection should be made by the most capable minds and masters in every\nbranch of knowledge after the most mature consideration, and the result\nof it established. Such a selection must be based on a sifting of\nmatters which are necessary and important for a man to know in general,\nand also for him to know in a particular profession or calling.\nKnowledge of the first kind would have to be divided into graduated\ncourses, like an encyclop\u00e6dia, corresponding to the degree of general\nculture which each man has attained in his external circumstances; from\na course restricted to what is necessary for primary instruction up to\nthe matter contained in every branch of the philosophical faculty.\nKnowledge of the second kind would, however, be reserved for him who had\nreally mastered the selection in all its branches. The whole would give\na canon specially devised for intellectual education, which naturally\nwould require revision every ten years. By such an arrangement the\nyouthful power of the memory would be put to the best advantage, and it\nwould furnish the faculty of judgment with excellent material when it\nappeared later on.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhat is meant by maturity of knowledge is that state of perfection to\nwhich any one individual is able to bring it, when an exact\ncorrespondence has been effected between the whole of his abstract ideas\nand his own personal observations: whereby each of his ideas rests\ndirectly or indirectly on a basis of observation, which alone gives it\nany real value; and likewise he is able to place every observation that\nhe makes under the right idea corresponding to it.\n_Maturity_ of knowledge is the work of experience alone, and\nconsequently of time. For the knowledge we acquire from our own\nobservation is, as a rule, distinct from that we get through abstract\nideas; the former is acquired in the natural way, while the latter comes\nthrough good and bad instruction and what other people have told to us.\nConsequently, in youth there is generally little harmony and connection\nbetween our ideas, which mere expressions have fixed, and our real\nknowledge, which has been acquired by observation. Later they both\ngradually approach and correct each other; but maturity of knowledge\ndoes not exist until they have become quite incorporated. This maturity\nis quite independent of that other kind of perfection, the standard of\nwhich may be high or low, I mean the perfection to which the capacities\nof an individual may be brought; it is not based on a correspondence\nbetween the abstract and intuitive knowledge, but on the degree of\nintensity of each.\nThe most necessary thing for the practical man is the attainment of an\nexact and thorough knowledge of _what is really going on in the world;_\nbut it is also the most irksome, for a man may continue studying until\nold age without having learnt all that is to be learnt; while one can\nmaster the most important things in the sciences in one's youth. In\ngetting such a knowledge of the world, it is as a novice that the boy\nand youth have the first and most difficult lessons to learn; but\nfrequently even the matured man has still much to learn. The study is of\nconsiderable difficulty in itself, but it is made doubly difficult by\n_novels_, which depict the ways of the world and of men who do not exist\nin real life. But these are accepted with the credulity of youth, and\nbecome incorporated with the mind; so that now, in the place of purely\nnegative ignorance, a whole framework of wrong ideas, which are\npositively wrong, crops up, subsequently confusing the schooling of\nexperience and representing the lesson it teaches in a false light. If\nthe youth was previously in the dark, he will now be led astray by a\nwill-o'-the-wisp: and with a girl this is still more frequently the\ncase. They have been deluded into an absolutely false view of life by\nreading novels, and expectations have been raised that can never be\nfulfilled. This generally has the most harmful effect on their whole\nlives. Those men who had neither time nor opportunity to read novels in\ntheir youth, such as those who work with their hands, have decided\nadvantage over them. Few of these novels are exempt from reproach--nay,\nwhose effect is contrary to bad. Before all others, for instance, _Gil\nBlas_ and the other works of Le Sage (or rather their Spanish\noriginals); further, _The Vicar of Wakefield_, and to some extent the\nnovels of Walter Scott. _Don Quixote_ may be regarded as a satirical\npresentation of the error in question.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[8] According to a notice from the Munich Society for the Protection of\nAnimals, the superfluous whipping and cracking were strictly forbidden\nin Nuremberg in December 1858.\nON READING AND BOOKS.\nIgnorance is degrading only when it is found in company with riches.\nWant and penury restrain the poor man; his employment takes the place of\nknowledge and occupies his thoughts: while rich men who are ignorant\nlive for their pleasure only, and resemble a beast; as may be seen\ndaily. They are to be reproached also for not having used wealth and\nleisure for that which lends them their greatest value.\nWhen we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental\nprocess. It is the same as the pupil, in learning to write, following\nwith his pen the lines that have been pencilled by the teacher.\nAccordingly, in reading, the work of thinking is, for the greater part,\ndone for us. This is why we are consciously relieved when we turn to\nreading after being occupied with our own thoughts. But, in reading, our\nhead is, however, really only the arena of some one else's thoughts. And\nso it happens that the person who reads a great deal--that is to say,\nalmost the whole day, and recreates himself by spending the intervals in\nthoughtless diversion, gradually loses the ability to think for himself;\njust as a man who is always riding at last forgets how to walk. Such,\nhowever, is the case with many men of learning: they have read\nthemselves stupid. For to read in every spare moment, and to read\nconstantly, is more paralysing to the mind than constant manual work,\nwhich, at any rate, allows one to follow one's own thoughts. Just as a\nspring, through the continual pressure of a foreign body, at last loses\nits elasticity, so does the mind if it has another person's thoughts\ncontinually forced upon it. And just as one spoils the stomach by\noverfeeding and thereby impairs the whole body, so can one overload and\nchoke the mind by giving it too much nourishment. For the more one reads\nthe fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a\ntablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to\nreflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one\nhas read if one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later,\nwhat has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost.\nIndeed, it is the same with mental as with bodily food: scarcely the\nfifth part of what a man takes is assimilated; the remainder passes off\nin evaporation, respiration, and the like.\nFrom all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are\nnothing more than footprints in the sand: one sees the road the man has\ntaken, but in order to know what he saw on the way, one requires his\neyes.\n*       *       *       *       *\nNo literary quality can be attained by reading writers who possess it:\nbe it, for example, persuasiveness, imagination, the gift of drawing\ncomparisons, boldness or bitterness, brevity or grace, facility of\nexpression or wit, unexpected contrasts, a laconic manner, na\u00efvet\u00e9, and\nthe like. But if we are already gifted with these qualities--that is to\nsay, if we possess them _potentia_--we can call them forth and bring\nthem to consciousness; we can discern to what uses they are to be put;\nwe can be strengthened in our inclination, nay, may have courage, to use\nthem; we can judge by examples the effect of their application and so\nlearn the correct use of them; and it is only after we have accomplished\nall this that we _actu_ possess these qualities. This is the only way in\nwhich reading can form writing, since it teaches us the use to which we\ncan put our own natural gifts; and in order to do this it must be taken\nfor granted that these qualities are in us. Without them we learn\nnothing from reading but cold, dead mannerisms, and we become mere\nimitators.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe health officer should, in the interest of one's eyes, see that the\nsmallness of print has a fixed minimum, which must not be exceeded. When\nI was in Venice in 1818, at which time the genuine Venetian chain was\nstill being made, a goldsmith told me that those who made the _catena\nfina_ turned blind at thirty.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAs the strata of the earth preserve in rows the beings which lived in\nformer times, so do the shelves of a library preserve in a like manner\nthe errors of the past and expositions concerning them. Like those\ncreatures, they too were full of life in their time and made a great\ndeal of noise; but now they are stiff and fossilised, and only of\ninterest to the literary palaeontologist.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAccording to Herodotus, Xerxes wept at the sight of his army, which was\ntoo extensive for him to scan, at the thought that a hundred years hence\nnot one of all these would be alive. Who would not weep at the thought\nin looking over a big catalogue that of all these books not one will be\nin existence in ten years' time?\nIt is the same in literature as in life. Wherever one goes one\nimmediately comes upon the incorrigible mob of humanity. It exists\neverywhere in legions; crowding, soiling everything, like flies in\nsummer. Hence the numberless bad books, those rank weeds of literature\nwhich extract nourishment from the corn and choke it.\nThey monopolise the time, money, and attention which really belong to\ngood books and their noble aims; they are written merely with a view to\nmaking money or procuring places. They are not only useless, but they do\npositive harm. Nine-tenths of the whole of our present literature aims\nsolely at taking a few shillings out of the public's pocket, and to\naccomplish this, author, publisher, and reviewer have joined forces.\nThere is a more cunning and worse trick, albeit a profitable one.\n_Litt\u00e9rateurs_, hack-writers, and productive authors have succeeded,\ncontrary to good taste and the true culture of the age, in bringing the\nworld _elegante_ into leading-strings, so that they have been taught to\nread _a tempo_ and all the same thing--namely, _the newest books_ order\nthat they may have material for conversation in their social circles.\nBad novels and similar productions from the pen of writers who were once\nfamous, such as Spindler, Bulwer, Eug\u00e8ne Sue, and so on, serve this\npurpose. But what can be more miserable than the fate of a reading\npublic of this kind, that feels always impelled to read the latest\nwritings of extremely commonplace authors who write for money only, and\ntherefore exist in numbers? And for the sake of this they merely know by\nname the works of the rare and superior writers, of all ages and\ncountries.\nLiterary newspapers, since they print the daily smatterings of\ncommonplace people, are especially a cunning means for robbing from the\naesthetic public the time which should be devoted to the genuine\nproductions of art for the furtherance of culture.\nHence, in regard to our subject, the art of _not_ reading is highly\nimportant. This consists in not taking a book into one's hand merely\nbecause it is interesting the great public at the time--such as\npolitical or religious pamphlets, novels, poetry, and the like, which\nmake a noise and reach perhaps several editions in their first and last\nyears of existence. Remember rather that the man who writes for fools\nalways finds a large public: and only read for a limited and definite\ntime exclusively the works of great minds, those who surpass other men\nof all times and countries, and whom the voice of fame points to as\nsuch. These alone really educate and instruct.\nOne can never read too little of bad, or too much of good books: bad\nbooks are intellectual poison; they destroy the mind.\nIn order to read what is good one must make it a condition never to read\nwhat is bad; for life is short, and both time and strength limited.\n*       *       *       *       *\nBooks are written sometimes about this, sometimes about that great\nthinker of former times, and the public reads these books, but not the\nworks of the man himself. This is because it wants to read only what has\njust been printed, and because _similis simili gaudet_, and it finds the\nshallow, insipid gossip of some stupid head of to-day more homogeneous\nand agreeable than the thoughts of great minds. I have to thank fate,\nhowever, that a fine epigram of A.B. Schlegel, which has since been my\nguiding star, came before my notice as a youth:\n\"Leset fleizig die Alten, die wahren eigentlich Alten\nWas die Neuen davon sagen bedeutet nicht viel.\"\nOh, how like one commonplace mind is to another! How they are all\nfashioned in one form! How they all think alike under similar\ncircumstances, and never differ! This is why their views are so personal\nand petty. And a stupid public reads the worthless trash written by\nthese fellows for no other reason than that it has been printed to-day,\nwhile it leaves the works of great thinkers undisturbed on the\nbookshelves.\nIncredible are the folly and perversity of a public that will leave\nunread writings of the noblest and rarest of minds, of all times and all\ncountries, for the sake of reading the writings of commonplace persons\nwhich appear daily, and breed every year in countless numbers like\nflies; merely because these writings have been printed to-day and are\nstill wet from the press. It would be better if they were thrown on one\nside and rejected the day they appeared, as they must be after the lapse\nof a few years. They will then afford material for laughter as\nillustrating the follies of a former time.\nIt is because people will only read what is _the newest_ instead of what\nis the best of all ages, that writers remain in the narrow circle of\nprevailing ideas, and that the age sinks deeper and deeper in its own\nmire.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThere are at all times two literatures which, although scarcely known to\neach other, progress side by side--the one real, the other merely\napparent. The former grows into literature that _lasts_. Pursued by\npeople who live _for_ science or poetry, it goes its way earnestly and\nquietly, but extremely slowly; and it produces in Europe scarcely a\ndozen works in a century, which, however, are _permanent_. The other\nliterature is pursued by people who live _on_ science or poetry; it goes\nat a gallop amid a great noise and shouting of those taking part, and\nbrings yearly many thousand works into the market. But after a few years\none asks, Where are they? where is their fame, which was so great\nformerly? This class of literature may be distinguished as fleeting, the\nother as permanent.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt would be a good thing to buy books if one could also buy the time to\nread them; but one usually confuses the purchase of books with the\nacquisition of their contents. To desire that a man should retain\neverything he has ever read, is the same as wishing him to retain in his\nstomach all that he has ever eaten. He has been bodily nourished on what\nhe has eaten, and mentally on what he has read, and through them become\nwhat he is. As the body assimilates what is homogeneous to it, so will a\nman _retain_ what _interests_ him; in other words, what coincides with\nhis system of thought or suits his ends. Every one has aims, but very\nfew have anything approaching a system of thought. This is why such\npeople do not take an objective interest in anything, and why they learn\nnothing from what they read: they remember nothing about it.\n_Repetitio est mater studiorum_. Any kind of important book should\nimmediately be read twice, partly because one grasps the matter in its\nentirety the second time, and only really understands the beginning when\nthe end is known; and partly because in reading it the second time one's\ntemper and mood are different, so that one gets another impression; it\nmay be that one sees the matter in another light.\nWorks are the quintessence of a mind, and are therefore always of by far\ngreater value than conversation, even if it be the conversation of the\ngreatest mind. In every essential a man's works surpass his conversation\nand leave it far behind. Even the writings of an ordinary man may be\ninstructive, worth reading, and entertaining, for the simple reason that\nthey are the quintessence of that man's mind--that is to say, the\nwritings are the result and fruit of his whole thought and study; while\nwe should be dissatisfied with his conversation. Accordingly, it is\npossible to read books written by people whose conversation would give\nus no satisfaction; so that the mind will only by degrees attain high\nculture by finding entertainment almost entirely in books, and not in\nmen.\nThere is nothing that so greatly recreates the mind as the works of the\nold classic writers. Directly one has been taken up, even if it is only\nfor half-an-hour, one feels as quickly refreshed, relieved, purified,\nelevated, and strengthened as if one had refreshed oneself at a mountain\nstream. Is this due to the perfections of the old languages, or to the\ngreatness of the minds whose works have remained unharmed and untouched\nfor centuries? Perhaps to both combined. This I know, directly we stop\nlearning the old languages (as is at present threatening) a new class of\nliterature will spring up, consisting of writing that is more barbaric,\nstupid, and worthless than has ever yet existed; that, in particular,\nthe German language, which possesses some of the beauties of the old\nlanguages, will be systematically spoilt and stripped by these worthless\ncontemporary scribblers, until, little by little, it becomes\nimpoverished, crippled, and reduced to a miserable jargon.\nHalf a century is always a considerable time in the history of the\nuniverse, for the matter which forms it is always shifting; something is\nalways taking place. But the same length of time in literature often\ngoes for nothing, because nothing has happened; unskilful attempts don't\ncount; so that we are exactly where we were fifty years previously.\nTo illustrate this: imagine the progress of knowledge among mankind in\nthe form of a planet's course. The false paths the human race soon\nfollows after any important progress has been made represent the\nepicycles in the Ptolemaic system; after passing through any one of them\nthe planet is just where it was before it entered it. The great minds,\nhowever, which really bring the race further on its course, do not\naccompany it on the epicycles which it makes every time. This explains\nwhy posthumous fame is got at the expense of contemporary fame, and\n_vice vers\u00e2_. We have an instance of such an epicycle in the philosophy\nof Fichte and Schelling, crowned by Hegel's caricature of it. This\nepicycle issued from the limit to which philosophy had been finally\nbrought by Kant, where I myself took it up again later to carry it\nfurther. In the interim the false philosophers I have mentioned, and\nsome others, passed through their epicycle, which has just been\nterminated; hence the people who accompanied them are conscious of being\nexactly at the point from which they started.\nThis condition of things shows why the scientific, literary, and\nartistic spirit of the age is declared bankrupt about every thirty\nyears. During that period the errors have increased to such an extent\nthat they fall under the weight of their absurdity; while at the same\ntime the opposition to them has become stronger. At this point there is\na crash, which is followed by an error in the opposite direction. To\nshow the course that is taken in its periodical return would be the true\npractical subject of the history of literature; little notice is taken\nof it, however. Moreover, through the comparative shortness of such\nperiods, the data of remote times are with difficulty collected; hence\nthe matter can be most conveniently observed in one's own age. An\nexample of this taken from physical science is found in Werter's\nNeptunian geology. But let me keep to the example already quoted above,\nfor it is nearest to us. In German philosophy Kant's brilliant period\nwas immediately followed by another period, which aimed at being\nimposing rather than convincing. Instead of being solid and clear, it\naimed at being brilliant and hyperbolical, and, in particular,\nunintelligible; instead of seeking truth, it intrigued. Under these\ncircumstances philosophy could make no progress. Ultimately the whole\nschool and its method became bankrupt. For the audacious, sophisticated\nnonsense on the one hand, and the unconscionable praise on the other of\nHegel and his fellows, as well as the apparent object of the whole\naffair, rose to such a pitch that in the end the charlatanry of the\nthing was obvious to everybody; and when, in consequence of certain\nrevelations, the protection that had been given it by the upper classes\nwas withdrawn, it was talked about by everybody. This most miserable of\nall the philosophies that have ever existed dragged down with it into\nthe abyss of discredit the systems of Fichte and Schelling, which had\npreceded it. So that the absolute philosophical futility of the first\nhalf of the century following upon Kant in Germany is obvious; and yet\nthe Germans boast of their gift for philosophy compared with foreigners,\nespecially since an English writer, with malicious irony, called them _a\nnation of thinkers_.\nThose who want an example of the general scheme of epicycles taken from\nthe history of art need only look at the School of Sculpture which\nflourished in the last century under Bernini, and especially at its\nfurther cultivation in France. This school represented commonplace\nnature instead of antique beauty, and the manners of a French minuet\ninstead of antique simplicity and grace. It became bankrupt when, under\nWinckelmann's direction, a return was made to the antique school.\nAnother example is supplied in the painting belonging to the first\nquarter of this century. Art was regarded merely as a means and\ninstrument of mediaeval religious feeling, and consequently\necclesiastical subjects alone were chosen for its themes. These,\nhowever, were treated by painters who were wanting in earnestness of\nfaith, and in their delusion they took for examples Francesco Francia,\nPietro Perugino, Angelico da Fiesole, and others like them, even holding\nthem in greater esteem than the truly great masters who followed. In\nview of this error, and because in poetry an analogous effort had at the\nsame time met with favour, Goethe wrote his parable _Pfaffenspiel_. This\nschool, reputedly capricious, became bankrupt, and was followed by a\nreturn to nature, which made itself known in _genre_ pictures and scenes\nof life of every description, even though it strayed sometimes into\nvulgarity.\nIt is the same with the progress of the human mind in the _history of\nliterature_, which is for the most part like the catalogue of a cabinet\nof deformities; the spirit in which they keep the longest is pigskin. We\ndo not need to look there for the few who have been born shapely; they\nare still alive, and we come across them in every part of the world,\nlike immortals whose youth is ever fresh. They alone form what I have\ndistinguished as _real_ literature, the history of which, although poor\nin persons, we learn from our youth up out of the mouths of educated\npeople, and not first of all from compilations. As a specific against\nthe present prevailing monomania for reading literary histories, so that\none may be able to chatter about everything without really knowing\nanything, let me refer you to a passage from Lichtenberg which is well\nworth reading (vol. ii. p. 302 of the old edition).\nBut I wish some one would attempt a _tragical history of literature_,\nshowing how the greatest writers and artists have been treated during\ntheir lives by the various nations which have produced them and whose\nproudest possessions they are. It would show us the endless fight which\nthe good and genuine works of all periods and countries have had to\ncarry on against the perverse and bad. It would depict the martyrdom of\nalmost all those who truly enlightened humanity, of almost all the great\nmasters in every kind of art; it would show us how they, with few\nexceptions, were tormented without recognition, without any to share\ntheir misery, without followers; how they existed in poverty and misery\nwhilst fame, honour, and riches fell to the lot of the worthless; it\nwould reveal that what happened to them happened to Esau, who, while\nhunting the deer for his father, was robbed of the blessing by Jacob\ndisguised in his brother's coat; and how through it all the love of\ntheir subject kept them up, until at last the trying fight of such a\nteacher of the human race is ended, the immortal laurel offered to him,\nand the time come when it can be said of him\n\"Der schwere Panzer wird zum Fl\u00fcgelkleide\nKurz ist der Schmerz, unendlich ist die Freude.\"\nTHE EMPTINESS OF EXISTENCE.\nThis emptiness finds its expression in the whole form of existence, in\nthe infiniteness of Time and Space as opposed to the finiteness of the\nindividual in both; in the flitting present as the only manner of real\nexistence; in the dependence and relativity of all things; in constantly\nBecoming without Being; in continually wishing without being satisfied;\nin an incessant thwarting of one's efforts, which go to make up life,\nuntil victory is won. _Time_, and the _transitoriness_ of all things,\nare merely the form under which the will to live, which as the\nthing-in-itself is imperishable, has revealed to Time the futility of\nits efforts. Time is that by which at every moment all things become as\nnothing in our hands, and thereby lose all their true value.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhat _has been_ exists no more; and exists just as little as that which\nhas _never_ been. But everything that exists _has been_ in the next\nmoment. Hence something belonging to the present, however unimportant it\nmay be, is superior to something important belonging to the past; this\nis because the former is a _reality_ and related to the latter as\nsomething is to nothing.\nA man to his astonishment all at once becomes conscious of existing\nafter having been in a state of non-existence for many thousands of\nyears, when, presently again, he returns to a state of non-existence for\nan equally long time. This cannot possibly be true, says the heart; and\neven the crude mind, after giving the matter its consideration, must\nhave some sort of presentiment of the ideality of time. This ideality of\ntime, together with that of space, is the key to every true system of\nmetaphysics, because it finds room for quite another order of things\nthan is to be found in nature. This is why Kant is so great.\nOf every event in our life it is only for a moment that we can say that\nit _is_; after that we must say for ever that it _was_. Every evening\nmakes us poorer by a day. It would probably make us angry to see this\nshort space of time slipping away, if we were not secretly conscious in\nthe furthest depths of our being that the spring of eternity belongs to\nus, and that in it we are always able to have life renewed.\nReflections of the nature of those above may, indeed, establish the\nbelief that to enjoy the present, and to make this the purpose of one's\nlife, is the greatest _wisdom_; since it is the present alone that is\nreal, everything else being only the play of thought. But such a purpose\nmight just as well be called the greatest _folly_, for that which in the\nnext moment exists no more, and vanishes as completely as a dream, can\nnever be worth a serious effort.\n*       *       *       *       *\nOur existence is based solely on the ever-fleeting present. Essentially,\ntherefore, it has to take the form of continual motion without there\never being any possibility of our finding the rest after which we are\nalways striving. It is the same as a man running downhill, who falls if\nhe tries to stop, and it is only by his continuing to run on that he\nkeeps on his legs; it is like a pole balanced on one's finger-tips, or\nlike a planet that would fall into its sun as soon as it stopped\nhurrying onwards. Hence unrest is the type of existence.\nIn a world like this, where there is no kind of stability, no\npossibility of anything lasting, but where everything is thrown into a\nrestless whirlpool of change, where everything hurries on, flies, and is\nmaintained in the balance by a continual advancing and moving, it is\nimpossible to imagine happiness. It cannot dwell where, as Plato says,\n_continual Becoming and never Being_ is all that takes place. First of\nall, no man is happy; he strives his whole life long after imaginary\nhappiness, which he seldom attains, and if he does, then it is only to\nbe disillusioned; and as a rule he is shipwrecked in the end and enters\nthe harbour dismasted. Then it is all the same whether he has been happy\nor unhappy in a life which was made up of a merely ever-changing present\nand is now at an end.\nMeanwhile it surprises one to find, both in the world of human beings\nand in that of animals, that this great, manifold, and restless motion\nis sustained and kept going by the medium of two simple impulses--hunger\nand the instinct of sex, helped perhaps a little by boredom--and that\nthese have the power to form the _primum mobile_ of so complex a\nmachinery, setting in motion the variegated show!\nLooking at the matter a little closer, we see at the very outset that\nthe existence of inorganic matter is being constantly attacked by\nchemical forces which eventually annihilates it. While organic existence\nis only made possible by continual change of matter, to keep up a\nperpetual supply of which it must consequently have help from without.\nTherefore organic life is like balancing a pole on one's hand; it must\nbe kept in continual motion, and have a constant supply of matter of\nwhich it is continually and endlessly in need. Nevertheless it is only\nby means of this organic life that consciousness is possible.\nAccordingly this is a _finite existence_, and its antithesis would be an\n_infinite_, neither exposed to any attack from without nor in want of\nhelp from without, and hence \u1f00\u03b5\u03af \u1f61\u03c3\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f44\u03bd, in eternal rest; \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u03b5\n\u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, without change, without time, and without\ndiversity; the negative knowledge of which is the fundamental note of\nPlato's philosophy. The denial of the will to live reveals the way to\nsuch a state as this.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe scenes of our life are like pictures in rough mosaic, which have no\neffect at close quarters, but must be looked at from a distance in order\nto discern their beauty. So that to obtain something we have desired is\nto find out that it is worthless; we are always living in expectation of\nbetter things, while, at the same time, we often repent and long for\nthings that belong to the past. We accept the present as something that\nis only temporary, and regard it only as a means to accomplish our aim.\nSo that most people will find if they look back when their life is at an\nend, that they have lived their lifelong _ad interim_, and they will be\nsurprised to find that something they allowed to pass by unnoticed and\nunenjoyed was just their life--that is to say, it was the very thing in\nthe expectation of which they lived. And so it may be said of man in\ngeneral that, befooled by hope, he dances into the arms of death.\nThen again, there is the insatiability of each individual will; every\ntime it is satisfied a new wish is engendered, and there is no end to\nits eternally insatiable desires.\nThis is because the Will, taken in itself, is the lord of worlds; since\neverything belongs to it, it is not satisfied with a portion of\nanything, but only with the whole, which, however, is endless. Meanwhile\nit must excite our pity when we consider how extremely little this lord\nof the world receives, when it makes its appearance as an individual;\nfor the most part only just enough to maintain the body. This is why man\nis so very unhappy.\nIn the present age, which is intellectually impotent and remarkable for\nits veneration of what is bad in every form--a condition of things which\nis quite in keeping with the coined word \"Jetztzeit\" (present time), as\npretentious as it is cacophonic--the pantheists make bold to say that\nlife is, as they call it, \"an end-in itself.\" If our existence in this\nworld were an end-in-itself, it would be the most absurd end that was\never determined; even we ourselves or any one else might have imagined\nit.\nLife presents itself next as a task, the task, that is, of subsisting\n_de gagner sa vie_. If this is solved, then that which has been won\nbecomes a burden, and involves the second task of its being got rid of\nin order to ward off boredom, which, like a bird of prey, is ready to\nfall upon any life that is secure from want.\nSo that the first task is to win something, and the second, after the\nsomething has been won, to forget about it, otherwise it becomes a\nburden.\nThat human life must be a kind of mistake is sufficiently clear from the\nfact that man is a compound of needs, which are difficult to satisfy;\nmoreover, if they are satisfied, all he is granted is a state of\npainlessness, in which he can only give himself up to boredom. This is a\nprecise proof that existence in itself has no value, since boredom is\nmerely the feeling of the emptiness of life. If, for instance, life, the\nlonging for which constitutes our very being, had in itself any positive\nand real value, boredom could not exist; mere existence in itself would\nsupply us with everything, and therefore satisfy us. But our existence\nwould not be a joyous thing unless we were striving after something;\ndistance and obstacles to be overcome then represent our aim as\nsomething that would satisfy us--an illusion which vanishes when our aim\nhas been attained; or when we are engaged in something that is of a\npurely intellectual nature, when, in reality, we have retired from the\nworld, so that we may observe it from the outside, like spectators at a\ntheatre. Even sensual pleasure itself is nothing but a continual\nstriving, which ceases directly its aim is attained. As soon as we are\nnot engaged in one of these two ways, but thrown back on existence\nitself, we are convinced of the emptiness and worthlessness of it; and\nthis it is we call boredom. That innate and ineradicable craving for\nwhat is out of the common proves how glad we are to have the natural and\ntedious course of things interrupted. Even the pomp and splendour of the\nrich in their stately castles is at bottom nothing but a futile attempt\nto escape the very essence of existence, _misery_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThat the most perfect manifestation of the _will to live_, which\npresents itself in the extremely subtle and complicated machinery of the\nhuman organism, must fall to dust and finally deliver up its whole being\nto dissolution, is the na\u00efve way in which Nature, invariably true and\ngenuine, declares the whole striving of the will in its very essence to\nbe of no avail. If it were of any value in itself, something\nunconditioned, its end would not be non-existence. This is the dominant\nnote of Goethe's beautiful song:\n\"Hoch auf dem alten Thurme steht\nDes Helden edler Geist.\"\nThat man is nothing but a phenomenon, that he is\nnot-the-thing-in-itself--I mean that he is not \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f44\u03bd--is proved by\nthe fact that _death is a necessity_.\nAnd how different the beginning of our life is to the end! The former is\nmade up of deluded hopes, sensual enjoyment, while the latter is pursued\nby bodily decay and the odour of death.\nThe road dividing the two, as far as our well-being and enjoyment of\nlife are concerned, is downhill; the dreaminess of childhood, the\njoyousness of youth, the troubles of middle age, the infirmity and\nfrequent misery of old age, the agonies of our last illness, and finally\nthe struggle with death--do all these not make one feel that existence\nis nothing but a mistake, the consequences of which are becoming\ngradually more and more obvious?\nIt would be wisest to regard life as a _desenga\u00f1o_, a delusion; that\neverything is intended to be so is sufficiently clear.\nOur life is of a microscopical nature; it is an indivisible point which,\ndrawn out by the powerful lenses of Time and Space, becomes considerably\nmagnified.\nTime is an element in our brain which by the means of duration gives a\nsemblance of reality to the _absolutely empty existence_ of things and\nourselves.\nHow foolish it is for a man to regret and deplore his having made no use\nof past opportunities, which might have secured him this or that\nhappiness or enjoyment! What is there left of them now? Only the ghost\nof a remembrance! And it is the same with everything that really falls\nto our lot. So that the _form of time_ itself, and how much is reckoned\non it, is a definite way of proving to us the vanity of all earthly\nenjoyment.\nOur existence, as well as that of all animals, is not one that lasts, it\nis only temporary, merely an _existentia fluxa_, which may be compared\nto a water-mill in that it is constantly changing.\nIt is true that the _form_ of the body lasts for a time, but only on\ncondition that the matter is constantly changing, that the old matter is\nthrown off and new added. And it is the chief work of all living\ncreatures to secure a constant supply of suitable matter. At the same\ntime, they are conscious that their existence is so fashioned as to last\nonly for a certain time, as has been said. This is why they attempt,\nwhen they are taking leave of life, to hand it over to some one else who\nwill take their place. This attempt takes the form of the sexual\ninstinct in self-consciousness, and in the consciousness of other things\npresents itself objectively--that is, in the form of genital instinct.\nThis instinct may be compared to the threading of a string of pearls;\none individual succeeding another as rapidly as the pearls on the\nthread. If we, in imagination, hasten on this succession, we shall see\nthat the matter is constantly changing in the whole row just as it is\nchanging in each pearl, while it retains the same form: we will then\nrealise that we have only a quasi-existence. That it is only Ideas which\nexist, and the shadow-like nature of the thing corresponding to them, is\nthe basis of Plato's teachings.\nThat we are nothing but _phenomena_ as opposed to the thing-in-itself is\nconfirmed, exemplified, and made clear by the fact that the _conditio\nsine qua non_ of our existence is a continual flowing off and flowing to\nof matter which, as nourishment, is a constant need. So that we resemble\nsuch phenomena as smoke, fire, or a jet of water, all of which die out\nor stop directly there is no supply of matter. It may be said then that\nthe _will to live_ presents itself in the form of _pure phenomena_ which\nend _in nothing_. This nothingness, however, together with the\nphenomena, remain within the boundary of the _will to live_ and are\nbased on it. I admit that this is somewhat obscure.\nIf we try to get a general view of humanity at a glance, we shall see\neverywhere a constant fighting and mighty struggling for life and\nexistence; that mental and bodily strength is taxed to the utmost, and\nopposed by threatening and actual dangers and woes of every kind.\nAnd if we consider the price that is paid for all this, existence, and\nlife itself, it will be found that there has been an interval when\nexistence was free from pain, an interval, however, which was\nimmediately followed by boredom, and which in its turn was quickly\nterminated by fresh cravings.\nThat boredom is immediately followed by fresh needs is a fact which is\nalso true of the cleverer order of animals, because life has _no true\nand genuine value_ in itself, but is kept _in motion_ merely through the\nmedium of needs and illusion. As soon as there are no needs and illusion\nwe become conscious of the absolute barrenness and emptiness of\nexistence.\nIf one turns from contemplating the course of the world at large, and in\nparticular from the ephemeral and mock existence of men as they follow\neach other in rapid succession, to the _detail_ of _life_, how like a\ncomedy it seems!\nIt impresses us in the same way as a drop of water, crowded with\n_infusoria_, seen through a microscope, or a little heap of cheese-mites\nthat would otherwise be invisible. Their activity and struggling with\neach other in such little space amuse us greatly. And it is the same in\nthe little span of life--great and earnest activity produces a comic\neffect.\nNo man has ever felt perfectly happy in the present; if he had it would\nhave intoxicated him.\nON WOMEN.\nThese few words of Jouy, _Sans les femmes le commencement de notre vie\nseroit priv\u00e9 de secours, le milieu de plaisirs et la fin de\nconsolation_, more exactly express, in my opinion, the true praise of\nwoman than Schiller's poem, _W\u00fcrde der Frauen_, which is the fruit of\nmuch careful thought and impressive because of its antithesis and use of\ncontrast. The same thing is more pathetically expressed by Byron in\n_Sardanapalus_, Act i, Sc. 2:--\n\"The very first\nOf human life must spring from woman's breast,\nYour first small words are taught you from her lips,\nYour first tears quench'd by her, and your last sighs\nToo often breathed out in a woman's hearing,\nWhen men have shrunk from the ignoble care\nOf watching the last hour of him who led them.\"\nBoth passages show the right point of view for the appreciation of\nwomen.\nOne need only look at a woman's shape to discover that she is not\nintended for either too much mental or too much physical work. She pays\nthe debt of life not by what she does but by what she suffers--by the\npains of child-bearing, care for the child, and by subjection to man, to\nwhom she should be a patient and cheerful companion. The greatest\nsorrows and joys or great exhibition of strength are not assigned to\nher; her life should flow more quietly, more gently, and less\nobtrusively than man's, without her being essentially happier or\nunhappier.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWomen are directly adapted to act as the nurses and educators of our\nearly childhood, for the simple reason that they themselves are\nchildish, foolish, and short-sighted--in a word, are big children all\ntheir lives, something intermediate between the child and the man, who\nis a man in the strict sense of the word. Consider how a young girl will\ntoy day after day with a child, dance with it and sing to it; and then\nconsider what a man, with the very best intentions in the world, could\ndo in her place.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWith girls, Nature has had in view what is called in a dramatic sense a\n\"striking effect,\" for she endows them for a few years with a richness\nof beauty and a, fulness of charm at the expense of the rest of their\nlives; so that they may during these years ensnare the fantasy of a man\nto such a degree as to make him rush into taking the honourable care of\nthem, in some kind of form, for a lifetime--a step which would not\nseem sufficiently justified if he only considered the matter.\nAccordingly, Nature has furnished woman, as she has the rest of her\ncreatures, with the weapons and implements necessary for the protection\nof her existence and for just the length of time that they will be of\nservice to her; so that Nature has proceeded here with her usual\neconomy. Just as the female ant after coition loses her wings, which\nthen become superfluous, nay, dangerous for breeding purposes, so for\nthe most part does a woman lose her beauty after giving birth to one or\ntwo children; and probably for the same reasons.\nThen again we find that young girls in their hearts regard their\ndomestic or other affairs as secondary things, if not as a mere jest.\nLove, conquests, and all that these include, such as dressing, dancing,\nand so on, they give their serious attention.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe nobler and more perfect a thing is, the later and slower is it in\nreaching maturity. Man reaches the maturity of his reasoning and mental\nfaculties scarcely before he is eight-and-twenty; woman when she is\neighteen; but hers is reason of very narrow limitations. This is why\nwomen remain children all their lives, for they always see only what is\nnear at hand, cling to the present, take the appearance of a thing for\nreality, and prefer trifling matters to the most important. It is by\nvirtue of man's reasoning powers that he does not live in the present\nonly, like the brute, but observes and ponders over the past and future;\nand from this spring discretion, care, and that anxiety which we so\nfrequently notice in people. The advantages, as well as the\ndisadvantages, that this entails, make woman, in consequence of her\nweaker reasoning powers, less of a partaker in them. Moreover, she is\nintellectually short-sighted, for although her intuitive understanding\nquickly perceives what is near to her, on the other hand her circle of\nvision is limited and does not embrace anything that is remote; hence\neverything that is absent or past, or in the future, affects women in a\nless degree than men. This is why they have greater inclination for\nextravagance, which sometimes borders on madness. Women in their hearts\nthink that men are intended to earn money so that they may spend it, if\npossible during their husband's lifetime, but at any rate after his\ndeath.\nAs soon as he has given them his earnings on which to keep house they\nare strengthened in this belief. Although all this entails many\ndisadvantages, yet it has this advantage--that a woman lives more in the\npresent than a man, and that she enjoys it more keenly if it is at all\nbearable. This is the origin of that cheerfulness which is peculiar to\nwoman and makes her fit to divert man, and in case of need, to console\nhim when he is weighed down by cares. To consult women in matters of\ndifficulty, as the Germans used to do in old times, is by no means a\nmatter to be overlooked; for their way of grasping a thing is quite\ndifferent from ours, chiefly because they like the shortest way to the\npoint, and usually keep their attention fixed upon what lies nearest;\nwhile we, as a rule, see beyond it, for the simple reason that it lies\nunder our nose; it then becomes necessary for us to be brought back to\nthe thing in order to obtain a near and simple view. This is why women\nare more sober in their judgment than we, and why they see nothing more\nin things than is really there; while we, if our passions are roused,\nslightly exaggerate or add to our imagination.\nIt is because women's reasoning powers are weaker that they show more\nsympathy for the unfortunate than men, and consequently take a kindlier\ninterest in them. On the other hand, women are inferior to men in\nmatters of justice, honesty, and conscientiousness. Again, because their\nreasoning faculty is weak, things clearly visible and real, and\nbelonging to the present, exercise a power over them which is rarely\ncounteracted by abstract thoughts, fixed maxims, or firm resolutions, in\ngeneral, by regard for the past and future or by consideration for what\nis absent and remote. Accordingly they have the first and principal\nqualities of virtue, but they lack the secondary qualities which are\noften a necessary instrument in developing it. Women may be compared in\nthis respect to an organism that has a liver but no gall-bladder.[9] So\nthat it will be found that the fundamental fault in the character of\nwomen is that they have no \"_sense of justice_.\" This arises from their\ndeficiency in the power of reasoning already referred to, and\nreflection, but is also partly due to the fact that Nature has not\ndestined them, as the weaker sex, to be dependent on strength but on\ncunning; this is why they are instinctively crafty, and have an\nineradicable tendency to lie. For as lions are furnished with claws and\nteeth, elephants with tusks, boars with fangs, bulls with horns, and the\ncuttlefish with its dark, inky fluid, so Nature has provided woman for\nher protection and defence with the faculty of dissimulation, and all\nthe power which Nature has given to man in the form of bodily strength\nand reason has been conferred on woman in this form. Hence,\ndissimulation is innate in woman and almost as characteristic of the\nvery stupid as of the clever. Accordingly, it is as natural for women to\ndissemble at every opportunity as it is for those animals to turn to\ntheir weapons when they are attacked; and they feel in doing so that in\na certain measure they are only making use of their rights. Therefore a\nwoman who is perfectly truthful and does not dissemble is perhaps an\nimpossibility. This is why they see through dissimulation in others so\neasily; therefore it is not advisable to attempt it with them. From the\nfundamental defect that has been stated, and all that it involves,\nspring falseness, faithlessness, treachery, ungratefulness, and so on.\nIn a court of justice women are more often found guilty of perjury than\nmen. It is indeed to be generally questioned whether they should be\nallowed to take an oath at all. From time to time there are repeated\ncases everywhere of ladies, who want for nothing, secretly pocketing and\ntaking away things from shop counters.\n*       *       *       *       *\nNature has made it the calling of the young, strong, and handsome men to\nlook after the propagation of the human race; so that the species may\nnot degenerate. This is the firm will of Nature, and it finds its\nexpression in the passions of women. This law surpasses all others in\nboth age and power. Woe then to the man who sets up rights and interests\nin such a way as to make them stand in the way of it; for whatever he\nmay do or say, they will, at the first significant onset, be\nunmercifully annihilated. For the secret, unformulated, nay, unconscious\nbut innate moral of woman is: _We are justified in deceiving those who,\nbecause they care a little for us_,--_that is to say for the\nindividual_,--_imagine they have obtained rights over the species. The\nconstitution, and consequently the welfare of the species, have been put\ninto our hands and entrusted to our care through the medium of the next\ngeneration which proceeds from us; let us fulfil our duties\nconscientiously_.\nBut women are by no means conscious of this leading principle _in\nabstracto_, they are only conscious of it _in concreto_, and have no\nother way of expressing it than in the manner in which they act when the\nopportunity arrives. So that their conscience does not trouble them so\nmuch as we imagine, for in the darkest depths of their hearts they are\nconscious that in violating their duty towards the individual they have\nall the better fulfilled it towards the species, whose claim upon them\nis infinitely greater. (A fuller explanation of this matter may be found\nin vol. ii., ch. 44, in my chief work, _Die Welt als Wille und\nVorstellung_.)\nBecause women in truth exist entirely for the propagation of the race,\nand their destiny ends here, they live more for the species than for the\nindividual, and in their hearts take the affairs of the species more\nseriously than those of the individual. This gives to their whole being\nand character a certain frivolousness, and altogether a certain tendency\nwhich is fundamentally different from that of man; and this it is which\ndevelops that discord in married life which is so prevalent and almost\nthe normal state.\nIt is natural for a feeling of mere indifference to exist between men,\nbut between women it is actual enmity. This is due perhaps to the fact\nthat _odium figulinum_ in the case of men, is limited to their everyday\naffairs, but with women embraces the whole sex; since they have only one\nkind of business. Even when they meet in the street, they look at each\nother like Guelphs and Ghibellines. And it is quite evident when two\nwomen first make each other's acquaintance that they exhibit more\nconstraint and dissimulation than two men placed in similar\ncircumstances. This is why an exchange of compliments between two women\nis much more ridiculous than between two men. Further, while a man will,\nas a rule, address others, even those inferior to himself, with a\ncertain feeling of consideration and humanity, it is unbearable to see\nhow proudly and disdainfully a lady of rank will, for the most part,\nbehave towards one who is in a lower rank (not employed in her service)\nwhen she speaks to her. This may be because differences of rank are much\nmore precarious with women than with us, and consequently more quickly\nchange their line of conduct and elevate them, or because while a\nhundred things must be weighed in our case, there is only one to be\nweighed in theirs, namely, with which man they have found favour; and\nagain, because of the one-sided nature of their vocation they stand in\ncloser relationship to each other than men do; and so it is they try to\nrender prominent the differences of rank.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt is only the man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual instinct\nthat could give that stunted, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and\nshort-legged race the name of _the fair sex_; for the entire beauty of\nthe sex is based on this instinct. One would be more justified in\ncalling them the _unaesthetic sex_ than the beautiful. Neither for\nmusic, nor for poetry, nor for fine art have they any real or true sense\nand susceptibility, and it is mere mockery on their part, in their\ndesire to please, if they affect any such thing.\nThis makes them incapable of taking a purely objective interest in\nanything, and the reason for it is, I fancy, as follows. A man strives\nto get _direct_ mastery over things either by understanding them or by\ncompulsion. But a woman is always and everywhere driven to _indirect_\nmastery, namely through a man; all her _direct_ mastery being limited to\nhim alone. Therefore it lies in woman's nature to look upon everything\nonly as a means for winning man, and her interest in anything else is\nalways a simulated one, a mere roundabout way to gain her ends,\nconsisting of coquetry and pretence. Hence Rousseau said, _Les femmes,\nen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, n'aiment aucun art, ne se connoissent \u00e0 aucun et n'ont aucun\ng\u00e9nie_ (Lettre \u00e0 d'Alembert, note xx.). Every one who can see through a\nsham must have found this to be the case. One need only watch the way\nthey behave at a concert, the opera, or the play; the childish\nsimplicity, for instance, with which they keep on chattering during the\nfinest passages in the greatest masterpieces. If it is true that the\nGreeks forbade women to go to the play, they acted in a right way; for\nthey would at any rate be able to hear something. In our day it would be\nmore appropriate to substitute _taceat mulier in theatro_ for _taceat\nmulier in ecclesia_; and this might perhaps be put up in big letters on\nthe curtain.\nNothing different can be expected of women if it is borne in mind that\nthe most eminent of the whole sex have never accomplished anything in\nthe fine arts that is really great, genuine, and original, or given to\nthe world any kind of work of permanent value. This is most striking in\nregard to painting, the technique of which is as much within their reach\nas within ours; this is why they pursue it so industriously. Still, they\nhave not a single great painting to show, for the simple reason that\nthey lack that objectivity of mind which is precisely what is so\ndirectly necessary in painting. They always stick to what is subjective.\nFor this reason, ordinary women have no susceptibility for painting at\nall: for _natura non facet saltum_. And Huarte, in his book which has\nbeen famous for three hundred years, _Examen de ingenios para las\nscienzias_, contends that women do not possess the higher capacities.\nIndividual and partial exceptions do not alter the matter; women are and\nremain, taken altogether, the most thorough and incurable philistines;\nand because of the extremely absurd arrangement which allows them to\nshare the position and title of their husbands they are a constant\nstimulus to his _ignoble_ ambitions. And further, it is because they are\nphilistines that modern society, to which they give the tone and where\nthey have sway, has become corrupted. As regards their position, one\nshould be guided by Napoleon's maxim, _Les femmes n'ont pas de rang_;\nand regarding them in other things, Chamfort says very truly: _Elles\nsont faites pour commercer avec nos faiblesses avec notre folie, mais\nnon avec notre raison. Il existe entre elles et les hommes des\nsympathies d'\u00e9piderme et tr\u00e8s-peu de sympathies d'esprit d'\u00e2me et de\ncaract\u00e8re_. They are the _sexus sequior_, the second sex in every\nrespect, therefore their weaknesses should be spared, but to treat women\nwith extreme reverence is ridiculous, and lowers us in their own eyes.\nWhen nature divided the human race into two parts, she did not cut it\nexactly through the middle! The difference between the positive and\nnegative poles, according to polarity, is not merely qualitative but\nalso quantitative. And it was in this light that the ancients and people\nof the East regarded woman; they recognised her true position better\nthan we, with our old French ideas of gallantry and absurd veneration,\nthat highest product of Christian-Teutonic stupidity. These ideas have\nonly served to make them arrogant and imperious, to such an extent as to\nremind one at times of the holy apes in Benares, who, in the\nconsciousness of their holiness and inviolability, think they can do\nanything and everything they please.\nIn the West, the woman, that is to say the \"lady,\" finds herself in a\n_fausse position_; for woman, rightly named by the ancients _sexus\nsequior_, is by no means fit to be the object of our honour and\nveneration, or to hold her head higher than man and to have the same\nrights as he. The consequences of this _fausse position_ are\nsufficiently clear. Accordingly, it would be a very desirable thing if\nthis Number Two of the human race in Europe were assigned her natural\nposition, and the lady-grievance got rid of, which is not only ridiculed\nby the whole of Asia, but would have been equally ridiculed by Greece\nand Rome. The result of this would be that the condition of our social,\ncivil, and political affairs would be incalculably improved. The Salic\nlaw would be unnecessary; it would be a superfluous truism. The European\nlady, strictly speaking, is a creature who should not exist at all; but\nthere ought to be housekeepers, and young girls who hope to become such;\nand they should be brought up not to be arrogant, but to be domesticated\nand submissive. It is exactly because there are _ladies_ in Europe that\nwomen of a lower standing, that is to say, the greater majority of the\nsex, are much more unhappy than they are in the East. Even Lord Byron\nsays (_Letters and Papers_, by Thomas Moore, vol. ii. p. 399), _Thought\nof the state of women under the ancient Greeks--convenient enough.\nPresent state, a remnant of the barbarism of the chivalric and feudal\nages--artificial and unnatural. They ought to mind home--and be well fed\nand clothed--but not mixed in society. Well educated, too, in\nreligion--but to read neither poetry nor politics--nothing but books of\npiety and cookery. Music--drawing--dancing--also a little gardening and\nploughing now and then. I have seen them mending the roads in Epirus\nwith good success. Why not, as well as hay-making and milking_?\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn our part of the world, where monogamy is in force, to marry means to\nhalve one's rights and to double one's duties. When the laws granted\nwoman the same rights as man, they should also have given her a\nmasculine power of reason. On the contrary, just as the privileges and\nhonours which the laws decree to women surpass what Nature has meted out\nto them, so is there a proportional decrease in the number of women who\nreally share these privileges; therefore the remainder are deprived of\ntheir natural rights in so far as the others have been given more than\nNature accords.\nFor the unnatural position of privilege which the institution of\nmonogamy, and the laws of marriage which accompany it, assign to the\nwoman, whereby she is regarded throughout as a full equivalent of the\nman, which she is not by any means, cause intelligent and prudent men to\nreflect a great deal before they make so great a sacrifice and consent\nto so unfair an arrangement. Therefore, whilst among polygamous nations\nevery woman finds maintenance, where monogamy exists the number of\nmarried women is limited, and a countless number of women who are\nwithout support remain over; those in the upper classes vegetate as\nuseless old maids, those in the lower are reduced to very hard work of a\ndistasteful nature, or become prostitutes, and lead a life which is as\njoyless as it is void of honour. But under such circumstances they\nbecome a necessity to the masculine sex; so that their position is\nopenly recognised as a special means for protecting from seduction those\nother women favoured by fate either to have found husbands, or who hope\nto find them. In London alone there are 80,000 prostitutes. Then what\nare these women who have come too quickly to this most terrible end but\nhuman sacrifices on the altar of monogamy? The women here referred to\nand who are placed in this wretched position are the inevitable\ncounterbalance to the European lady, with her pretensions and arrogance.\nHence polygamy is a real benefit to the female sex, taking it _as a\nwhole_. And, on the other hand, there is no reason why a man whose wife\nsuffers from chronic illness, or remains barren, or has gradually become\ntoo old for him, should not take a second. Many people become converts\nto Mormonism for the precise reasons that they condemn the unnatural\ninstitution of monogamy. The conferring of unnatural rights upon women\nhas imposed unnatural duties upon them, the violation of which, however,\nmakes them unhappy. For example, many a man thinks marriage unadvisable\nas far as his social standing and monetary position are concerned,\nunless he contracts a brilliant match. He will then wish to win a woman\nof his own choice under different conditions, namely, under those which\nwill render safe her future and that of her children. Be the conditions\never so just, reasonable, and adequate, and she consents by giving up\nthose undue privileges which marriage, as the basis of civil society,\nalone can bestow, she must to a certain extent lose her honour and lead\na life of loneliness; since human nature makes us dependent on the\nopinion of others in a way that is completely out of proportion to its\nvalue. While, if the woman does not consent, she runs the risk of being\ncompelled to marry a man she dislikes, or of shrivelling up into an old\nmaid; for the time allotted to her to find a home is very short. In view\nof this side of the institution of monogamy, Thomasius's profoundly\nlearned treatise, _de Concubinatu_, is well worth reading, for it shows\nthat, among all nations, and in all ages, down to the Lutheran\nReformation, concubinage was allowed, nay, that it was an institution,\nin a certain measure even recognised by law and associated with no\ndishonour. And it held this position until the Lutheran Reformation,\nwhen it was recognised as another means for justifying the marriage of\nthe clergy; whereupon the Catholic party did not dare to remain\nbehindhand in the matter.\nIt is useless to argue about polygamy, it must be taken as a fact\nexisting everywhere, the _mere regulation_ of which is the problem to be\nsolved. Where are there, then, any real monogamists? We all live, at any\nrate for a time, and the majority of us always, in polygamy.\nConsequently, as each man needs many women, nothing is more just than to\nlet him, nay, make it incumbent upon him to provide for many women. By\nthis means woman will be brought back to her proper and natural place as\na subordinate being, and _the lady_, that monster of European\ncivilisation and Christian-Teutonic stupidity, with her ridiculous claim\nto respect and veneration, will no longer exist; there will still be\n_women_, but no _unhappy women_, of whom Europe is at present full. The\nMormons' standpoint is right.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn India no woman is ever independent, but each one stands under the\ncontrol of her father or her husband, or brother or son, in accordance\nwith the law of Manu.\nIt is certainly a revolting idea that widows should sacrifice themselves\non their husband's dead body; but it is also revolting that the money\nwhich the husband has earned by working diligently for all his life, in\nthe hope that he was working for his children, should be wasted on her\nparamours. _Medium tenuere beati_. The first love of a mother, as that\nof animals and men, is purely _instinctive_, and consequently ceases\nwhen the child is no longer physically helpless. After that, the first\nlove should be reinstated by a love based on habit and reason; but this\noften does not appear, especially where the mother has not loved the\nfather. The love of a father for his children is of a different nature\nand more sincere; it is founded on a recognition of his own inner self\nin the child, and is therefore metaphysical in its origin.\nIn almost every nation, both of the new and old world, and even among\nthe Hottentots, property is inherited by the male descendants alone; it\nis only in Europe that one has departed from this. That the property\nwhich men have with difficulty acquired by long-continued struggling and\nhard work should afterwards come into the hands of women, who, in their\nwant of reason, either squander it within a short time or otherwise\nwaste it, is an injustice as great as it is common, and it should be\nprevented by limiting the right of women to inherit. It seems to me that\nit would be a better arrangement if women, be they widows or daughters,\nonly inherited the money for life secured by mortgage, but not the\nproperty itself or the capital, unless there lacked male descendants. It\nis men who make the money, and not women; therefore women are neither\njustified in having unconditional possession of it nor capable of\nadministrating it. Women should never have the free disposition of\nwealth, strictly so-called, which they may inherit, such as capital,\nhouses, and estates. They need a guardian always; therefore they should\nnot have the guardianship of their children under any circumstances\nwhatever. The vanity of women, even if it should not be greater than\nthat of men, has this evil in it, that it is directed on material\nthings--that is to say, on their personal beauty and then on tinsel,\npomp, and show. This is why they are in their right element in society.\nThis it is which makes them inclined to be _extravagant_, especially\nsince they possess little reasoning power. Accordingly, an ancient\nwriter says, \u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9.[10] Men's vanity, on\nthe other hand, is often directed on non-material advantages, such as\nintellect, learning, courage, and the like. Aristotle explains in the\n_Politics_[11] the great disadvantages which the Spartans brought upon\nthemselves by granting too much to their women, by allowing them the\nright of inheritance and dowry, and a great amount of freedom; and how\nthis contributed greatly to the fall of Sparta. May it not be that the\ninfluence of women in France, which has been increasing since Louis\nXIII.'s time, was to blame for that gradual corruption of the court and\ngovernment which led to the first Revolution, of which all subsequent\ndisturbances have been the result? In any case, the false position of\nthe female sex, so conspicuously exposed by the existence of the \"lady,\"\nis a fundamental defect in our social condition, and this defect,\nproceeding from the very heart of it, must extend its harmful influence\nin every direction. That woman is by nature intended to obey is shown by\nthe fact that every woman who is placed in the unnatural position of\nabsolute independence at once attaches herself to some kind of man, by\nwhom she is controlled and governed; this is because she requires a\nmaster. If she, is young, the man is a lover; if she is old, a priest.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[9] Let me refer to what I have said in my treatise on _The Foundation\nof Morals_, \u00a771.\n[10] Brunck's _Gnomici poetae graeci_ v. 115.\n[11] Bk. I., ch. 9.\nTHINKING FOR ONESELF.\nThe largest library in disorder is not so useful as a smaller but\norderly one; in the same way the greatest amount of knowledge, if it has\nnot been worked out in one's own mind, is of less value than a much\nsmaller amount that has been fully considered. For it is only when a man\ncombines what he knows from all sides, and compares one truth with\nanother, that he completely realises his own knowledge and gets it into\nhis power. A man can only think over what he knows, therefore he should\nlearn something; but a man only knows what he has pondered.\nA man can apply himself of his own free will to reading and learning,\nwhile he cannot to thinking. Thinking must be kindled like a fire by a\ndraught and sustained by some kind of interest in the subject. This\ninterest may be either of a purely objective nature or it may be merely\nsubjective. The latter exists in matters concerning us personally, but\nobjective interest is only to be found in heads that think by nature,\nand to whom thinking is as natural as breathing; but they are very rare.\nThis is why there is so little of it in most men of learning.\nThe difference between the effect that thinking for oneself and that\nreading has on the mind is incredibly great; hence it is continually\ndeveloping that original difference in minds which induces one man to\nthink and another to read. Reading forces thoughts upon the mind which\nare as foreign and heterogeneous to the bent and mood in which it may be\nfor the moment, as the seal is to the wax on which it stamps its\nimprint. The mind thus suffers total compulsion from without; it has\nfirst this and first that to think about, for which it has at the time\nneither instinct nor liking.\nOn the other hand, when a man thinks for himself he follows his own\nimpulse, which either his external surroundings or some kind of\nrecollection has determined at the moment. His visible surroundings do\nnot leave upon his mind _one_ single definite thought as reading does,\nbut merely supply him with material and occasion to think over what is\nin keeping with his nature and present mood. This is why _much_ reading\nrobs the mind of all elasticity; it is like keeping a spring under a\ncontinuous, heavy weight. If a man does not want to think, the safest\nplan is to take up a book directly he has a spare moment.\nThis practice accounts for the fact that learning makes most men more\nstupid and foolish than they are by nature, and prevents their writings\nfrom being a success; they remain, as Pope has said,\n\"For ever reading, never to be read.\"--_Dunciad_ iii. 194.\nMen of learning are those who have read the contents of books. Thinkers,\ngeniuses, and those who have enlightened the world and furthered the\nrace of men, are those who have made direct use of the book of the\nworld.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIndeed, it is only a man's own fundamental thoughts that have truth and\nlife in them. For it is these that he really and completely understands.\nTo read the thoughts of others is like taking the remains of some one\nelse's meal, like putting on the discarded clothes of a stranger.\nThe thought we read is related to the thought which rises in us, as the\nfossilised impress of a prehistoric plant is to a plant budding out in\nspring.\n*       *       *       *       *\nReading is merely a substitute for one's own thoughts. A man allows his\nthoughts to be put into leading-strings.\nFurther, many books serve only to show how many wrong paths there are,\nand how widely a man may stray if he allows himself to be led by them.\nBut he who is guided by his genius, that is to say, he who thinks for\nhimself, who thinks voluntarily and rightly, possesses the compass\nwherewith to find the right course. A man, therefore, should only read\nwhen the source of his own thoughts stagnates; which is often the case\nwith the best of minds.\nIt is sin against the Holy Spirit to frighten away one's own original\nthoughts by taking up a book. It is the same as a man flying from Nature\nto look at a museum of dried plants, or to study a beautiful landscape\nin copperplate. A man at times arrives at a truth or an idea after\nspending much time in thinking it out for himself, linking together his\nvarious thoughts, when he might have found the same thing in a book; it\nis a hundred times more valuable if he has acquired it by thinking it\nout for himself. For it is only by his thinking it out for himself that\nit enters as an integral part, as a living member into the whole system\nof his thought, and stands in complete and firm relation with it; that\nit is fundamentally understood with all its consequences, and carries\nthe colour, the shade, the impress of his own way of thinking; and comes\nat the very moment, just as the necessity for it is felt, and stands\nfast and cannot be forgotten. This is the perfect application, nay,\ninterpretation of Goethe's\n\"Was du ererbt von deinen V\ufffdtern hast\nErwirb es um es zu besitzen.\"\nThe man who thinks for himself learns the authorities for his opinions\nonly later on, when they serve merely to strengthen both them and\nhimself; while the book-philosopher starts from the authorities and\nother people's opinions, therefrom constructing a whole for himself; so\nthat he resembles an automaton, whose composition we do not understand.\nThe other man, the man who thinks for himself, on the other hand, is\nlike a living man as made by nature. His mind is impregnated from\nwithout, which then bears and brings forth its child. Truth that has\nbeen merely learned adheres to us like an artificial limb, a false\ntooth, a waxen nose, or at best like one made out of another's flesh;\ntruth which is acquired by thinking for oneself is like a natural\nmember: it alone really belongs to us. Here we touch upon the difference\nbetween the thinking man and the mere man of learning. Therefore the\nintellectual acquirements of the man who thinks for himself are like a\nfine painting that stands out full of life, that has its light and shade\ncorrect, the tone sustained, and perfect harmony of colour. The\nintellectual attainments of the merely learned man, on the contrary,\nresemble a big palette covered with every colour, at most systematically\narranged, but without harmony, relation, and meaning.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Reading_ is thinking with some one else's head instead of one's own.\nBut to think for oneself is to endeavour to develop a coherent whole, a\nsystem, even if it is not a strictly complete one. Nothing is more\nharmful than, by dint of continual reading, to strengthen the current of\nother people's thoughts. These thoughts, springing from different minds,\nbelonging to different systems, bearing different colours, never flow\ntogether of themselves into a unity of thought, knowledge, insight, or\nconviction, but rather cram the head with a Babylonian confusion of\ntongues; consequently the mind becomes overcharged with them and is\ndeprived of all clear insight and almost disorganised. This condition of\nthings may often be discerned in many men of learning, and it makes them\ninferior in sound understanding, correct judgment, and practical tact to\nmany illiterate men, who, by the aid of experience, conversation, and a\nlittle reading, have acquired a little knowledge from without, and made\nit always subordinate to and incorporated it with their own thoughts.\nThe scientific _thinker_ also does this to a much greater extent.\nAlthough he requires much knowledge and must read a great deal, his mind\nis nevertheless strong enough to overcome it all, to assimilate it, to\nincorporate it with the system of his thoughts, and to subordinate it to\nthe organic relative unity of his insight, which is vast and\never-growing. By this means his own thought, like the bass in an organ,\nalways takes the lead in everything, and is never deadened by other\nsounds, as is the case with purely antiquarian minds; where all sorts of\nmusical passages, as it were, run into each other, and the fundamental\ntone is entirely lost.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe people who have spent their lives in reading and acquired their\nwisdom out of books resemble those who have acquired exact information\nof a country from the descriptions of many travellers. These people can\nrelate a great deal about many things; but at heart they have no\nconnected, clear, sound knowledge of the condition of the country. While\nthose who have spent their life in thinking are like the people who have\nbeen to that country themselves; they alone really know what it is they\nare saying, know the subject in its entirety, and are quite at home in\nit.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe ordinary book-philosopher stands in the same relation to a man who\nthinks for himself as an eye-witness does to the historian; he speaks\nfrom his own direct comprehension of the subject.\nTherefore all who think for themselves hold at bottom much the same\nviews; when they differ it is because they hold different points of\nview, but when these do not alter the matter they all say the same\nthing. They merely express what they have grasped from an objective\npoint of view. I have frequently hesitated to give passages to the\npublic because of their paradoxical nature, and afterwards to my joyful\nsurprise have found the same thoughts expressed in the works of great\nmen of long ago.\nThe book-philosopher, on the other hand, relates what one man has said\nand another man meant, and what a third has objected to, and so on. He\ncompares, weighs, criticises, and endeavours to get at the truth of the\nthing, and in this way resembles the critical historian. For instance,\nhe will try to find out whether Leibnitz was not for some time in his\nlife a follower of Spinoza, etc. The curious student will find striking\nexamples of what I mean in Herbart's _Analytical Elucidation of Morality\nand Natural Right_, and in his _Letters on Freedom_. It surprises us\nthat such a man should give himself so much trouble; for it is evident\nthat if he had fixed his attention on the matter he would soon have\nattained his object by thinking a little for himself.\nBut there is a small difficulty to overcome; a thing of this kind does\nnot depend upon our own will. One can sit down at any time and read, but\nnot--think. It is with thoughts as with men: we cannot always summon\nthem at pleasure, but must wait until they come. Thought about a subject\nmust come of its own accord by a happy and harmonious union of external\nmotive with mental temper and application; and it is precisely that\nwhich never seems to come to these people.\nOne has an illustration of this in matters that concern our personal\ninterest. If we have to come to a decision on a thing of this kind we\ncannot sit down at any particular moment and thrash out the reasons and\narrive at a decision; for often at such a time our thoughts cannot be\nfixed, but will wander off to other things; a dislike to the subject is\nsometimes responsible for this. We should not use force, but wait until\nthe mood appears of itself; it frequently comes unexpectedly and even\nrepeats itself; the different moods which possess us at the different\ntimes throwing another light on the matter. It is this long process\nwhich is understood by _a ripe resolution_. For the task of making up\nour mind must be distributed; much that has been previously overlooked\noccurs to us; the aversion also disappears, for, after examining the\nmatter closer, it seems much more tolerable than it was at first sight.\nAnd in theory it is just the same: a man must wait for the right moment;\neven the greatest mind is not always able to think for itself at all\ntimes. Therefore it is advisable for it to use its spare moments in\nreading, which, as has been said, is a substitute for one's own thought;\nin this way material is imported to the mind by letting another think\nfor us, although it is always in a way which is different from our own.\nFor this reason a man should not read too much, in order that his mind\ndoes not become accustomed to the substitute, and consequently even\nforget the matter in question; that it may not get used to walking in\npaths that have already been trodden, and by following a foreign course\nof thought forget its own. Least of all should a man for the sake of\nreading entirely withdraw his attention from the real world: as the\nimpulse and temper which lead one to think for oneself proceed oftener\nfrom it than from reading; for it is the visible and real world in its\nprimitiveness and strength that is the natural subject of the thinking\nmind, and is able more easily than anything else to rouse it. After\nthese considerations it will not surprise us to find that the thinking\nman can easily be distinguished from the book-philosopher by his marked\nearnestness, directness, and originality, the personal conviction of all\nhis thoughts and expressions: the book-philosopher, on the other hand,\nhas everything second-hand; his ideas are like a collection of old rags\nobtained anyhow; he is dull and pointless, resembling a copy of a copy.\nHis style, which is full of conventional, nay, vulgar phrases and\ncurrent terms, resembles a small state where there is a circulation of\nforeign money because it coins none of its own.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMere experience can as little as reading take the place of thought. Mere\nempiricism bears the same relation to thinking as eating to digestion\nand assimilation. When experience boasts that it alone, by its\ndiscoveries, has advanced human knowledge, it is as though the mouth\nboasted that it was its work alone to maintain the body.\nThe works of all really capable minds are distinguished from all other\nworks by a character of decision and definiteness, and, in consequence,\nof lucidity and clearness. This is because minds like these know\ndefinitely and clearly what they wish to express--whether it be in\nprose, in verse, or in music. Other minds are wanting in this decision\nand clearness, and therefore may be instantly recognised.\nThe characteristic sign of a mind of the highest standard is the\ndirectness of its judgment. Everything it utters is the result of\nthinking for itself; this is shown everywhere in the way it gives\nexpression to its thoughts. Therefore it is, like a prince, an imperial\ndirector in the realm of intellect. All other minds are mere delegates,\nas may be seen by their style, which has no stamp of its own.\nHence every true thinker for himself is so far like a monarch; he is\nabsolute, and recognises nobody above him. His judgments, like the\ndecrees of a monarch, spring from his own sovereign power and proceed\ndirectly from himself. He takes as little notice of authority as a\nmonarch does of a command; nothing is valid unless he has himself\nauthorised it. On the other hand, those of vulgar minds, who are swayed\nby all kinds of current opinions, authorities, and prejudices, are like\nthe people which in silence obey the law and commands.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe people who are so eager and impatient to settle disputed questions,\nby bringing forward authorities, are really glad when they can place the\nunderstanding and insight of some one else in the field in place of\ntheir own, which are deficient. Their number is legion. For, as Seneca\nsays, \"_Unusquisque mavult credere, quam judicare._\"\nThe weapon they commonly use in their controversies is that of\nauthorities: they strike each other with it, and whoever is drawn into\nthe fray will do well not to defend himself with reason and arguments;\nfor against a weapon of this kind they are like horned Siegfrieds,\nimmersed in a flood of incapacity for thinking and judging. They will\nbring forward their authorities as an _argumentum ad verecundiam_ and\nthen cry _victoria_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIn the realm of reality, however fair, happy, and pleasant it may prove\nto be, we always move controlled by the law of gravity, which we must be\nunceasingly overcoming. While in the realm of thought we are disembodied\nspirits, uncontrolled by the law of gravity and free from penury.\nThis is why there is no happiness on earth like that which at the\npropitious moment a fine and fruitful mind finds in itself.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe presence of a thought is like the presence of our beloved. We\nimagine we shall never forget this thought, and that this loved one\ncould never be indifferent to us. But out of sight out of mind! The\nfinest thought runs the risk of being irrevocably forgotten if it is not\nwritten down, and the dear one of being forsaken if we do not marry her.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThere are many thoughts which are valuable to the man who thinks them;\nbut out of them only a few which possess strength to produce either\nrepercussion or reflex action, that is, to win the reader's sympathy\nafter they have been written down. It is what a man has thought out\ndirectly _for himself_ that alone has true value. Thinkers may be\nclassed as follows: those who, in the first place, think for themselves,\nand those who think directly for others. The former thinkers are the\ngenuine, _they think for themselves_ in both senses of the word; they\nare the true _philosophers_; they alone are in earnest. Moreover, the\nenjoyment and happiness of their existence consist in thinking. The\nothers are the _sophists_; they wish to _seem_, and seek their happiness\nin what they hope to get from other people; their earnestness consists\nin this. To which of these two classes a man belongs is soon seen by his\nwhole method and manner. Lichtenberg is an example of the first class,\nwhile Herder obviously belongs to the second.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhen one considers how great and how close to us the _problem of\nexistence_ is,--this equivocal, tormented, fleeting, dream-like\nexistence--so great and so close that as soon as one perceives it, it\novershadows and conceals all other problems and aims;--and when one sees\nhow all men--with a few and rare exceptions--are not clearly conscious\nof the problem, nay, do not even seem to see it, but trouble themselves\nabout everything else rather than this, and live on taking thought only\nfor the present day and the scarcely longer span of their own personal\nfuture, while they either expressly give the problem up or are ready to\nagree with it, by the aid of some system of popular metaphysics, and are\nsatisfied with this;--when one, I say, reflects upon this, so may one be\nof the opinion that man is a _thinking being_ only in a very remote\nsense, and not feel any special surprise at any trait of thoughtlessness\nor folly; but know, rather, that the intellectual outlook of the normal\nman indeed surpasses that of the brute,--whose whole existence resembles\na continual present without any consciousness of the future or the\npast--but, however, not to such an extent as one is wont to suppose.\nAnd corresponding to this, we find in the conversation of most men that\ntheir thoughts are cut up as small as chaff, making it impossible for\nthem to spin out the thread of their discourse to any length. If this\nworld were peopled by really thinking beings, noise of every kind would\nnot be so universally tolerated, as indeed the most horrible and aimless\nform of it is.[12] If Nature had intended man to think she would not\nhave given him ears, or, at any rate, she would have furnished them with\nair-tight flaps like the bat, which for this reason is to be envied.\nBut, in truth, man is like the rest, a poor animal, whose powers are\ncalculated only to maintain him during his existence; therefore he\nrequires to have his ears always open to announce of themselves, by\nnight as by day, the approach of the pursuer.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[12] See Essay on Noise, p. 28.\nSHORT DIALOGUE ON\nTHE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF OUR TRUE BEING BY DEATH.\n_Thrasymachos._ Tell me briefly, what shall I be after my death? Be\nclear and precise.\n_Philalethes._ Everything and nothing.\n_Thras._ That is what I expected. You solve the problem by a\ncontradiction. That trick is played out.\n_Phil._ To answer transcendental questions in language that is made for\nimmanent knowledge must assuredly lead to a contradiction.\n_Thras._ What do you call transcendental knowledge, and what immanent?\nIt is true these expressions are known to me, for my professor used\nthem, but only as predicates of God, and as his philosophy had\nexclusively to do with God, their use was quite appropriate. For\ninstance, if God was in the world, He was immanent; if He was somewhere\noutside it, He was transcendent. That is clear and comprehensible. One\nknows how things stand. But your old-fashioned Kantian doctrine is no\nlonger understood. There has been quite a succession of great men in the\nmetropolis of German learning----\n_Phil. (aside)._ German philosophical nonsense!\n_Thras._----such as the eminent Schleiermacher and that gigantic mind\nHegel; and to-day we have left all that sort of thing behind, or rather\nwe are so far ahead of it that it is out of date and known no more.\nTherefore, what good is it?\n_Phil._ Transcendental knowledge is that which, going beyond the\nboundary of possible experience, endeavours to determine the nature of\nthings as they are in themselves; while immanent knowledge keeps itself\nwithin the boundary of possible experience, therefore it can only apply\nto phenomena. As an individual, with your death there will be an end of\nyou. But your individuality is not your true and final being, indeed it\nis rather the mere expression of it; it is not the thing-in-itself but\nonly the phenomenon presented in the form of time, and accordingly has\nboth a beginning and an end. Your being in itself, on the contrary,\nknows neither time, nor beginning, nor end, nor the limits of a given\nindividuality; hence no individuality can be without it, but it is there\nin each and all. So that, in the first sense, after death you become\nnothing; in the second, you are and remain everything. That is why I\nsaid that after death you would be all and nothing. It is difficult to\ngive you a more exact answer to your question than this and to be brief\nat the same time; but here we have undoubtedly another contradiction;\nthis is because your life is in time and your immortality in eternity.\nHence your immortality may be said to be something that is\nindestructible and yet has no endurance--which is again contradictory,\nyou see. This is what happens when transcendental knowledge is brought\nwithin the boundary of immanent knowledge; in doing this some sort of\nviolence is done to the latter, since it is used for things for which it\nwas not intended.\n_Thras._ Listen; without I retain my individuality I shall not give a\n_sou_ for your immortality.\n_Phil._ Perhaps you will allow me to explain further. Suppose I\nguarantee that you will retain your individuality, on condition,\nhowever, that you spend three months in absolute unconsciousness before\nyou awaken.\n_Thras._ I consent to that.\n_Phil._ Well then, as we have no idea of time when in a perfectly\nunconscious state, it is all the same to us when we are dead whether\nthree months or ten thousand years pass away in the world of\nconsciousness. For in the one case, as in the other, we must accept on\nfaith and trust what we are told when we awake. Accordingly it will be\nall the same to you whether your individuality is restored to you after\nthe lapse of three months or ten thousand years.\n_Thras._ At bottom, that cannot very well be denied.\n_Phil._ But if, at the end of those ten thousand years, some one has\nquite forgotten to waken you, I imagine that you would have become\naccustomed to that long state of non-existence, following such a very\nshort existence, and that the misfortune would not be very great.\nHowever, it is quite certain that you would know nothing about it. And\nagain, it would fully console you to know that the mysterious power\nwhich gives life to your present phenomenon had never ceased for one\nmoment during the ten thousand years to produce other phenomena of a\nlike nature and to give them life.\n_Thras._ Indeed! And so it is in this way that you fancy you can\nquietly, and without my knowing, cheat me of my individuality? But you\ncannot cozen me in this way. I have stipulated for the retaining of my\nindividuality, and neither mysterious forces nor phenomena can console\nme for the loss of it. It is dear to me, and I shall not let it go.\n_Phil._ That is to say, you regard your individuality as something so\nvery delightful, excellent, perfect, and incomparable that there is\nnothing better than it; would you not exchange it for another, according\nto what is told us, that is better and more lasting?\n_Thras._ Look here, be my individuality what it may, it is myself,\n\"For God is God, and I am I.\"\nI--I--I want to exist! That is what I care about, and not an existence\nwhich has to be reasoned out first in order to show that it is mine.\n_Phil._ Look what you are doing! When you say, _I--I--I want to exist_\nyou alone do not say this, but everything, absolutely everything, that\nhas only a vestige of consciousness. Consequently this desire of yours\nis just that which is _not_ individual but which is common to all\nwithout distinction. It does not proceed from individuality, but from\n_existence_ in general; it is the essential in everything that exists,\nnay, it is _that_ whereby anything has existence at all; accordingly it\nis concerned and satisfied only with existence _in general_ and not with\nany definite individual existence; this is not its aim. It has the\nappearance of being so because it can attain consciousness only in an\nindividual existence, and consequently looks as if it were entirely\nconcerned with that. This is nothing but an illusion which has entangled\nthe individual; but by reflection, it can be dissipated and we ourselves\nset free. It is only _indirectly_ that the individual has this great\nlonging for existence; it is the will to live in general that has this\nlonging directly and really, a longing that is one and the same in\neverything. Since, then, existence itself is the free work of the will,\nnay, the mere reflection of it, existence cannot be apart from will, and\nthe latter will be provisionally satisfied with existence in general, in\nso far, namely, as that which is eternally dissatisfied can be\nsatisfied. The will is indifferent to individuality; it has nothing to\ndo with it, although it appears to, because the individual is _only_\ndirectly conscious of will in himself. From this it is to be gathered\nthat the individual carefully guards his own existence; moreover, if\nthis were not so, the preservation of the species would not be assured.\nFrom all this it follows that individuality is not a state of perfection\nbut of limitation; so that to be freed from it is not loss but rather\ngain. Don't let this trouble you any further, it will, forsooth, appear\nto you both childish and extremely ridiculous when you completely and\nthoroughly recognise what you are, namely, that your own existence is\nthe universal will to live.\n_Thras._ You are childish yourself and extremely ridiculous, and so are\nall philosophers; and when a sedate man like myself lets himself in for\na quarter of an hour's talk with such fools, it is merely for the sake\nof amusement and to while away the time. I have more important matters\nto look to now; so, adieu!\nRELIGION.\nA DIALOGUE.\n_Demopheles._ Between ourselves, dear old friend, I am sometimes\ndissatisfied with you in your capacity as philosopher; you talk\nsarcastically about religion, nay, openly ridicule it. The religion of\nevery one is sacred to him, and so it should be to you.\n_Philalethes. Nego consequentiam!_ I don't see at all why I should have\nrespect for lies and frauds because other people are stupid. I respect\ntruth everywhere, and it is precisely for that reason that I cannot\nrespect anything that is opposed to it. My maxim is, _Vigeat veritas, et\npereat mundus_, the same as the lawyer's _Fiat justitia, et pereat\nmundus._ Every profession ought to have an analogous device.\n_Demop._ Then that of the medical profession would be, _Fiant pilulae,\net pereat mundus_, which would be the easiest to carry out.\n_Phil._ Heaven forbid! Everything must be taken _cum grano salis_.\n_Demop._ Exactly; and it is just for that reason that I want you to\naccept religion _cum grano salis_, and to see that the needs of the\npeople must be met according to their powers of comprehension. Religion\naffords the only means of proclaiming and making the masses of crude\nminds and awkward intelligences, sunk in petty pursuits and material\nwork, feel the high import of life. For the ordinary type of man,\nprimarily, has no thought for anything else but what satisfies his\nphysical needs and longings, and accordingly affords him a little\namusement and pastime. Founders of religion and philosophers come into\nthe world to shake him out of his torpidity and show him the high\nsignificance of existence: philosophers for the few, the emancipated;\nfounders of religion for the many, humanity at large. For \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd\n\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, as your friend Plato has said, and you should not\nforget it. Religion is the metaphysics of the people, which by all means\nthey must keep; and hence it must be eternally respected, for to\ndiscredit it means taking it away. Just as there is popular poetry,\npopular wisdom in proverbs, so too there must be popular metaphysics;\nfor mankind requires most certainly _an interpretation of life_, and it\nmust be in keeping with its power of comprehension. So that this\ninterpretation is at all times an allegorical investiture of the truth,\nand it fulfils, as far as practical life and our feelings are\nconcerned--that is to say, as a guidance in our affairs, and as a\ncomfort and consolation in suffering and death--perhaps just as much as\ntruth itself could, if we possessed it. Don't be hurt at its unpolished,\nbaroque, and apparently absurd form, for you, with your education and\nlearning, cannot imagine the roundabout ways that must be used in order\nto make people in their crude state understand deep truths. The various\nreligions are only various forms in which the people grasp and\nunderstand the truth, which in itself they could not grasp, and which is\ninseparable from these forms. Therefore, my dear fellow, don't be\ndispleased if I tell you that to ridicule these forms is both\nnarrow-minded and unjust.\n_Phil._ But is it not equally narrow-minded and unjust to require that\nthere shall be no other metaphysics but this one cut out to meet the\nneeds and comprehension of the people? that its teachings shall be the\nboundary of human researches and the standard of all thought, so that\nthe metaphysics of the few, the emancipated, as you call them, must aim\nat confirming, strengthening, and interpreting the metaphysics of the\npeople? That is, that the highest faculties of the human mind must\nremain unused and undeveloped, nay, be nipped in the bud, so that their\nactivity may not thwart the popular metaphysics? And at bottom are not\nthe claims that religion makes just the same? Is it right to have\ntolerance, nay, gentle forbearance, preached by what is intolerance and\ncruelty itself? Let me remind you of the heretical tribunals,\ninquisitions, religious wars and crusades, of Socrates' cup of poison,\nof Bruno's and Vanini's death in the flames. And is all this to-day\nsomething belonging to the past? What can stand more in the way of\ngenuine philosophical effort, honest inquiry after truth, the noblest\ncalling of the noblest of mankind, than this conventional system of\nmetaphysics invested with a monopoly from the State, whose principles\nare inculcated so earnestly, deeply, and firmly into every head in\nearliest youth as to make them, unless the mind is of miraculous\nelasticity, become ineradicable? The result is that the basis of healthy\nreasoning is once and for all deranged--in other words, its feeble\ncapacity for thinking for itself, and for unbiassed judgment in regard\nto everything to which it might be applied, is for ever paralysed and\nruined.\n_Demop,_ Which really means that the people have gained a conviction\nwhich they will not give up in order to accept yours in its place.\n_Phil._ Ah! if it were only conviction based on insight, one would then\nbe able to bring forward arguments and fight the battle with equal\nweapons. But religions admittedly do not lend themselves to conviction\nafter argument has been brought to bear, but to belief as brought about\nby revelation. The capacity for belief is strongest in childhood;\ntherefore one is most careful to take possession of this tender age. It\nis much more through this than through threats and reports of miracles\nthat the doctrines of belief take root. If in early childhood certain\nfundamental views and doctrines are preached with unusual solemnity and\nin a manner of great earnestness, the like of which has never been seen\nbefore, and if, too, the possibility of a doubt about them is either\ncompletely ignored or only touched upon in order to show that doubt is\nthe first step to everlasting perdition; the result is that the\nimpression will be so profound that, as a rule, that is to say in almost\nevery case, a man will be almost as incapable of doubting the truth of\nthose doctrines as he is of doubting his own existence. Hence it is\nscarcely one in many thousands that has the strength of mind to honestly\nand seriously ask himself--is that true? Those who are able to do this\nhave been more appropriately styled strong minds, _esprits forts_, than\nis imagined. For the commonplace mind, however, there is nothing so\nabsurd or revolting but what, if inoculated in this way, the firmest\nbelief in it will take root. If, for example, the killing of a heretic\nor an infidel were an essential matter for the future salvation of the\nsoul, almost every one would make it the principal object of his life,\nand in dying get consolation and strength from the remembrance of his\nhaving succeeded; just as, in truth, in former times almost every\nSpaniard looked upon an _auto da f\u00e9_ as the most pious of acts and one\nmost pleasing to God.\nWe have an analogy to this in India in the _Thugs_, a religious body\nquite recently suppressed by the English, who executed numbers of them.\nThey showed their regard for religion and veneration for the goddess\nKali by assassinating at every opportunity their own friends and\nfellow-travellers, so that they might obtain their possessions, and they\nwere seriously convinced that thereby they had accomplished something\nthat was praiseworthy and would contribute to their eternal welfare. The\npower of religious dogma, that has been inculcated early, is so great\nthat it destroys conscience, and finally all compassion and sense of\nhumanity. But if you wish to see with your own eyes, and close at hand,\nwhat early inoculation of belief does, look at the English. Look at this\nnation, favoured by nature before all others, endowed before all others\nwith reason, intelligence, power of judgment, and firmness of character;\nlook at these people degraded, nay, made despicable among all others by\ntheir stupid ecclesiastical superstition, which among their other\ncapacities appears like a fixed idea, a monomania. For this they have to\nthank the clergy in whose hands education is, and who take care to\ninculcate all the articles, of belief at the earliest age in such a way\nas to result in a kind of partial paralysis of the brain; this then\nshows itself throughout their whole life in a silly bigotry, making even\nextremely intelligent and capable people among them degrade themselves\nso that they become quite an enigma to us. If we consider how essential\nto such a masterpiece is inoculation of belief in the tender age of\nchildhood, the system of missions appears no longer merely as the height\nof human importunity, arrogance, and impertinence, but also of\nabsurdity; in so far as it does not confine itself to people who are\nstill in the stage of _childhood_, such as the Hottentots, Kaffirs,\nSouth Sea Islanders, and others like them, among whom it has been really\nsuccessful. While, on the other hand, in India the Brahmans receive the\ndoctrines of missionaries either with a smile of condescending approval\nor refuse them with a shrug of their shoulders; and among these people\nin general, notwithstanding the most favourable circumstances, the\nmissionaries' attempts at conversion are usually wrecked. An authentic\nreport in vol. xxi. of the _Asiatic Journal_ of 1826 shows that after so\nmany years of missionary activity in the whole of India (of which the\nEnglish possessions alone amount to one hundred and fifteen million\ninhabitants) there are not more than three hundred living converts to be\nfound; and at the same time it is admitted that the Christian converts\nare distinguished for their extreme immorality. There are only three\nhundred venal and bribed souls out of so many millions. I cannot see\nthat it has gone better with Christianity in India since then, although\nthe missionaries are now trying, contrary to agreement, to work on the\nchildren's minds in schools exclusively devoted to secular English\ninstruction, in order to smuggle in Christianity, against which,\nhowever, the Hindoos are most jealously on their guard. For, as has been\nsaid, childhood is the time, and not manhood, to sow the seeds of\nbelief, especially where an earlier belief has taken root. An acquired\nconviction, however, that is assumed by matured converts serves,\ngenerally, as only the mask for some kind of personal interest. And it\nis the feeling that this could hardly be otherwise that makes a man, who\nchanges his religion at maturity, despised by most people everywhere; a\nfact which reveals that they do not regard religion as a matter of\nreasoned conviction but merely as a belief inoculated in early\nchildhood, before it has been put to any test. That they are right in\nlooking at religion in this way is to be gathered from the fact that it\nis not only the blind, credulous masses, but also the clergy of every\nreligion, who, as such, have studied its sources, arguments, dogmas and\ndifferences, who cling faithfully and zealously as a body to the\nreligion of their fatherland; consequently it is the rarest thing in the\nworld for a priest to change from one religion or creed to another. For\ninstance, we see that the Catholic clergy are absolutely convinced of\nthe truth of all the principles of their Church, and that the\nProtestants are also of theirs, and that both defend the principles of\ntheir confession with like zeal. And yet the conviction is the outcome\nmerely of the country in which each is born: the truth of the Catholic\ndogma is perfectly clear to the clergy of South Germany, the Protestant\nto the clergy of North Germany. If, therefore, these convictions rest on\nobjective reasons, these reasons must be climatic and thrive like\nplants, some only here, some only there. The masses everywhere, however,\naccept on trust and faith the convictions of those who are _locally\nconvinced_.\n_Demop._ That doesn't matter, for essentially it makes no difference.\nFor instance, Protestantism in reality is more suited to the north,\nCatholicism to the south.\n_Phil._ So it appears. Still, I take a higher point of view, and have\nbefore me a more important object, namely, the progress of the knowledge\nof truth among the human race. It is a frightful condition of things\nthat, wherever a man is born, certain propositions are inculcated in his\nearliest youth, and he is assured that under penalty of forfeiting\neternal salvation he may never entertain any doubt about them; in so\nfar, that is, as they are propositions which influence the foundation of\nall our other knowledge and accordingly decide for ever our point of\nview, and if they are false, upset it for ever. Further, as the\ninfluences drawn from these propositions make inroads everywhere into\nthe entire system of our knowledge, the whole of human knowledge is\nthrough and through affected by them. This is proved by every\nliterature, and most conspicuously by that of the Middle Age, but also,\nin too great an extent, by that of the fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies. We see how paralysed even the minds of the first rank of all\nthose epochs were by such false fundamental conceptions; and how\nespecially all insight into the true substance and working of Nature was\nhemmed in on every side. During the whole of the Christian period Theism\nlay like a kind of oppressive nightmare on all intellectual effort, and\non philosophical effort in particular, hindering and arresting all\nprogress. For the men of learning of those epochs, God, devil, angels,\ndemons, hid the whole of Nature; no investigation was carried out to the\nend, no matter sifted to the bottom; everything that was beyond the most\nobvious _causal nexus_ was immediately attributed to these; so that, as\nPomponatius expressed himself at the time, _Certe philosophi nihil\nverisimile habent ad haec, quare necesse est, ad Deum, ad angelos et\ndaemones recurrere._ It is true that there is a suspicion of irony in\nwhat this man says, as his malice in other ways is known, nevertheless\nhe has expressed the general way of thinking of his age. If any one, on\nthe other hand, possessed that rare elasticity of mind which alone\nenabled him to free himself from the fetters, his writings, and he\nhimself with them, were burnt; as happened to Bruno and Vanini. But how\nabsolutely paralysed the ordinary mind is by that early metaphysical\npreparation may be seen most strikingly, and from its most ridiculous\nside, when it undertakes to criticise the doctrines of a foreign belief.\nOne finds the ordinary man, as a rule, merely trying to carefully prove\nthat the dogmas of the foreign belief do not agree with those of his\nown; he labours to explain that not only do they not say the same, but\ncertainly do not mean the same thing as his. With that he fancies in his\nsimplicity that he has proved the falsity of the doctrines of the alien\nbelief. It really never occurs to him to ask the question which of the\ntwo is right; but his own articles of belief are to him as _\u00e0 priori_\ncertain principles. The Rev. Mr. Morrison has furnished an amusing\nexample of this kind in vol. xx. of the _Asiatic Journal_ wherein he\ncriticises the religion and philosophy of the Chinese.\n_Demop._ So that's your higher point of view. But I assure you that\nthere is a higher still. _Primum vivere, deinde philosophari_ is of more\ncomprehensive significance than one supposes at first sight. Before\neverything else, the raw and wicked tendencies of the masses ought to be\nrestrained, in order to protect them from doing anything that is\nextremely unjust, or committing cruel, violent, and disgraceful deeds.\nIf one waited until they recognised and grasped the truth one would\nassuredly come too late. And supposing they had already found truth, it\nwould surpass their powers of comprehension. In any case it would be a\nmere allegorical investiture of truth, a parable, or a myth that would\nbe of any good to them. There must be, as Kant has said, a public\nstandard of right and virtue, nay, this must at all times flutter high.\nIt is all the same in the end what kind of heraldic figures are\nrepresented on it, if they only indicate what is meant. Such an\nallegorical truth is at all times and everywhere, for mankind at large,\na beneficial substitute for an eternally unattainable truth, and in\ngeneral, for a philosophy which it can never grasp; to say nothing of\nits changing its form daily, and not having as yet attained any kind of\ngeneral recognition. Therefore practical aims, my good Philalethes, have\nin every way the advantage of theoretical.\n_Phil._ This closely resembles the ancient advice of Timaeus of Locrus,\nthe Pythagorean: \u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b5\u1f30 \u03ba\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\n\u1f00\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9.[13] And I almost suspect that it is your wish, according to the\nfashion of to-day, to remind me--\n\"Good friend, the time is near\nWhen we may feast off what is good in peace.\"\nAnd your recommendation means that we should take care in time, so that\nthe waves of the dissatisfied, raging masses may not disturb us at\ntable. But the whole of this point of view is as false as it is nowadays\nuniversally liked and praised; this is why I make haste to put in a\nprotest against it. It is _false_ that state, justice, and law cannot be\nmaintained without the aid of religion and its articles of belief, and\nthat justice and police regulations need religion as a complement in\norder to carry out legislative arrangements. It is _false_ if it were\nrepeated a hundred times. For the ancients, and especially the Greeks,\nfurnish us with striking _instantia in contrarium_ founded on fact. They\nhad absolutely nothing of what we understand by religion. They had no\nsacred documents, no dogma to be learnt, and its acceptance advanced by\nevery one, and its principles inculcated early in youth. The servants of\nreligion preached just as little about morals, and the ministers\nconcerned themselves very little about any kind of morality or in\ngeneral about what the people either did or left undone. No such thing.\nBut the duty of the priests was confined merely to temple ceremonies,\nprayers, songs, sacrifices, processions, lustrations, and the like, all\nof which aimed at anything but the moral improvement of the individual.\nThe whole of their so-called religion consisted, and particularly in the\ntowns, in some of the _deorum majorum gentium_ having temples here and\nthere, in which the aforesaid worship was conducted as an affair of\nstate, when in reality it was an affair of police. No one, except the\nfunctionaries engaged, was obliged in any way to be present, or even to\nbelieve in it. In the whole of antiquity there is no trace of any\nobligation to believe in any kind of dogma. It was merely any one who\nopenly denied the existence of the gods or calumniated them that was\npunished; because by so doing he insulted the state which served these\ngods; beyond this every one was allowed to think what he chose of them.\nIf any one wished to win the favour of these gods privately by prayer or\nsacrifice he was free to do so at his own cost and risk; if he did not\ndo it, no one had anything to say against it, and least of all the\nState. Every Roman had his own Lares and Penates at home, which were,\nhowever, at bottom nothing more than the revered portraits of his\nancestors. The ancients had no kind of decisive, clear, and least of all\ndogmatically fixed ideas about the immortality of the soul and a life\nhereafter, but every one in his own way had lax, vacillating, and\nproblematical ideas; and their ideas about the gods were just as\nvarious, individual, and vague. So that the ancients had really no\n_religion_ in our sense of the word. Was it for this reason that anarchy\nand lawlessness reigned among them? Is not law and civil order rather so\nmuch their work, that it still constitutes the foundation of ours? Was\nnot property perfectly secure, although it consisted of slaves for the\ngreater part? And did not this condition of things last longer than a\nthousand years?\nSo I cannot perceive, and must protest against the practical aims and\nnecessity of religion in the sense which you have indicated, and in such\ngeneral favour to-day, namely, as an indispensable foundation of all\nlegislative regulations. For from such a standpoint the pure and sacred\nstriving after light and truth, to say the least, would seem quixotic\nand criminal if it should venture in its feeling of justice to denounce\nthe authoritative belief as a usurper who has taken possession of the\nthrone of truth and maintained it by continuing the deception.\n_Demop._ But religion is not opposed to truth; for it itself teaches\ntruth. Only it must not allow truth to appear in its naked form, because\nits sphere of activity is not a narrow auditory, but the world and\nhumanity at large, and therefore it must conform to the requirements and\ncomprehension of so great and mixed a public; or, to use a medical\nsimile, it must not present it pure, but must as a medium make use of a\nmythical vehicle. Truth may also be compared in this respect to certain\nchemical stuffs which in themselves are gaseous, but which for official\nuses, as also for preservation or transmission, must be bound to a firm,\npalpable base, because they would otherwise volatilise. For example,\nchlorine is for all such purposes applied only in the form of chlorides.\nBut if truth, pure, abstract, and free from anything of a mythical\nnature, is always to remain unattainable by us all, philosophers\nincluded, it might be compared to fluorine, which cannot be presented by\nitself alone, but only when combined with other stuffs. Or, to take a\nsimpler simile, truth, which cannot be expressed in any other way than\nby myth and allegory, is like water that cannot be transported without a\nvessel; but philosophers, who insist upon possessing it pure, are like a\nperson who breaks the vessel in order to get the water by itself. This\nis perhaps a true analogy. At any rate, religion is truth allegorically\nand mythically expressed, and thereby made possible and digestible to\nmankind at large. For mankind could by no means digest it pure and\nunadulterated, just as we cannot live in pure oxygen but require an\naddition of four-fifths of nitrogen. And without speaking figuratively,\nthe profound significance and high aim of life can only be revealed and\nshown to the masses symbolically, because they are not capable of\ngrasping life in its real sense; while philosophy should be like the\nEleusinian mysteries, for the few, the elect.\n_Phil._ I understand. The matter resolves itself into truth putting on\nthe dress of falsehood. But in doing so it enters into a fatal alliance.\nWhat a dangerous weapon is given into the hands of those who have the\nauthority to make use of falsehood as the vehicle of truth! If such is\nthe case, I fear there will be more harm caused by the falsehood than\ngood derived from the truth. If the allegory were admitted to be such, I\nshould say nothing against it; but in that case it would be deprived of\nall respect, and consequently of all efficacy. Therefore the allegory\nmust assert a claim, which it must maintain, to be true in _sensu\nproprio_ while at the most it is true in _sensu allegorico_. Here lies\nthe incurable mischief, the permanent evil; and therefore religion is\nalways in conflict, and always will be with the free and noble striving\nafter pure truth.\n_Demop_. Indeed, no. Care has been taken to prevent that. If religion\nmay not exactly admit its allegorical nature, it indicates it at any\nrate sufficiently.\n_Phil_. And in what way does it do that?\n_Demop_. In its mysteries. _Mystery_ is at bottom only the theological\n_terminus technicus_ for religious allegory. All religions have their\nmysteries. In reality, a mystery is a palpably absurd dogma which\nconceals in itself a lofty truth, which by itself would be absolutely\nincomprehensible to the ordinary intelligence of the raw masses. The\nmasses accept it in this disguise on trust and faith, without allowing\nthemselves to be led astray by its absurdity, which is palpable to them;\nand thereby they participate in the kernel of the matter so far as they\nare able. I may add as an explanation that the use of mystery has been\nattempted even in philosophy; for example, when Pascal, who was pietest,\nmathematician, and philosopher in one, says in this threefold character:\n_God is everywhere centre and nowhere periphery_. Malebranche has also\ntruly remarked, _La libert\u00e9 est un myst\u00e8re_. One might go further, and\nmaintain that in religions everything is really mystery. For it is\nutterly impossible to impart truth in _sensu proprio_ to the multitude\nin its crudity; it is only a mythical and allegorical reflection of it\nthat can fall to its share and enlighten it. Naked truth must not appear\nbefore the eyes of the profane vulgar; it can only appear before them\nclosely veiled. And it is for this reason that it is unfair to demand of\na religion that it should be true in _sensu proprio_, and that, _en\npassant_. Rationalists and Supernaturalists of to-day are so absurd.\nThey both start with the supposition that religion must be the truth;\nand while the former prove that it is not, the latter obstinately\nmaintain that it is; or rather the former cut up and dress the allegory\nin such a way that it could be true in _sensu proprio_ but would in that\ncase become a platitude. The latter wish to maintain, without further\ndressing, that it is true in _sensu proprio_, which, as they should\nknow, can only be carried into execution by inquisitions and the stake.\nWhile in reality, myth and allegory are the essential elements of\nreligion, but under the indispensable condition (because of the\nintellectual limitations of the great masses) that it supplies enough\nsatisfaction to meet those metaphysical needs of mankind which are\nineradicable, and that it takes the place of pure philosophical truth,\nwhich is infinitely difficult, and perhaps never attainable.\n_Phil._ Yes, pretty much in the same way as a wooden leg takes the place\nof a natural one. It supplies what is wanting, does very poor service\nfor it, and claims to be regarded as a natural leg, and is more or less\ncleverly put together. There is a difference, however, for, as a rule,\nthe natural leg was in existence before the wooden one, while religion\neverywhere has gained the start of philosophy.\n_Demop._ That may be; but a wooden leg is of great value to those who\nhave no natural leg. You must keep in view that the metaphysical\nrequirements of man absolutely demand satisfaction; because the horizon\nof his thoughts must be defined and not remain unlimited. A man, as a\nrule, has no faculty of judgment for weighing reasons, and\ndistinguishing between what is true and what is false. Moreover, the\nwork imposed upon him by nature and her requirements leaves him no time\nfor investigations of that kind, or for the education which they\npresuppose. Therefore it is entirely out of the question to imagine he\nwill be convinced by reasons; there is nothing left for him but belief\nand authority. Even if a really true philosophy took the place of\nreligion, at least nine-tenths of mankind would only accept it on\nauthority, so that it would be again a matter of belief; for Plato's\n\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 will always hold good. Authority,\nhowever, is only established by time and circumstances, so that we\ncannot bestow it on that which has only reason to commend it;\naccordingly, we must grant it only to that which has attained it in the\ncourse of history, even if it is only truth represented allegorically.\nThis kind of truth, supported by authority, appeals directly to the\nessentially metaphysical temperament of man--that is, to his need of a\ntheory concerning the riddle of existence, which thrusts itself upon\nhim, and arises from the consciousness that behind the physical in the\nworld there must be a metaphysical, an unchangeable something, which\nserves as the foundation of constant change. It also appeals to the\nwill, fears, and hopes of mortals living in constant need; religion\nprovides them with gods, demons, to whom they call, appease, and\nconciliate. Finally, it appeals to their moral consciousness, which is\nundeniably present, and lends to it that authenticity and support from\nwithout--a support without which it would not easily maintain itself in\nthe struggle against so many temptations. It is exactly from this side\nthat religion provides an inexhaustible source of consolation and\ncomfort in the countless and great sorrows of life, a comfort which does\nnot leave men in death, but rather then unfolds its full efficacy. So\nthat religion is like some one taking hold of the hand of a blind person\nand leading him, since he cannot see for himself; all that the blind\nperson wants is to attain his end, not to see everything as he walks\nalong.\n_Phil._ This side is certainly the brilliant side of religion. If it is\na _fraus_ it is indeed a _pia fraus_; that cannot be denied. Then\npriests become something between deceivers and moralists. For they dare\nnot teach the real truth, as you yourself have quite correctly\nexplained, even if it were known to them; which it is not. There can, at\nany rate, be a true philosophy, but there can be no true religion: I\nmean true in the real and proper understanding of the word, not merely\nin that flowery and allegorical sense which you have described, a sense\nin which every religion would be true only in different degrees. It is\ncertainly quite in harmony with the inextricable admixture of good and\nevil, honesty and dishonesty, goodness and wickedness, magnanimity and\nbaseness, which the world presents everywhere, that the most important,\nthe most lofty, and the most sacred truths can make their appearance\nonly in combination with a lie, nay, can borrow strength from a lie as\nsomething that affects mankind more powerfully; and as revelation must\nbe introduced by a lie. One might regard this fact as the _monogram_ of\nthe moral world. Meanwhile let us not give up the hope that mankind will\nsome day attain that point of maturity and education at which it is able\nto produce a true philosophy on the one hand, and accept it on the\nother. _Simplex sigillum veri_: the naked truth must be so simple and\ncomprehensible that one can impart it to all in its true form without\nany admixture of myth and fable (a pack of lies)--in other words,\nwithout masking it as _religion_.\n_Demop._ You have not a sufficient idea of the wretched capacities of\nthe masses.\n_Phil._ I express it only as a hope; but to give it up is impossible. In\nthat case, if truth were in a simpler and more comprehensible form, it\nwould surely soon drive religion from the position of vicegerent which\nit has so long held. Then religion will have fulfilled her mission and\nfinished her course; she might then dismiss the race which she has\nguided to maturity and herself retire in peace. This will be the\n_euthanasia_ of religion. However, as long as she lives she has two\nfaces, one of truth and one of deceit. According as one looks\nattentively at one or the other one will like or dislike her. Hence\nreligion must be regarded as a necessary evil, its necessity resting on\nthe pitiful weak-mindedness of the great majority of mankind, incapable\nof grasping the truth, and consequently when in extremity requires a\nsubstitute for truth.\n_Demop._ Really, one would think that you philosophers had truth lying\nin readiness, and all that one had to do was to lay hold of it.\n_Phil._ If we have not got it, it is principally to be ascribed to the\npressure under which philosophy, at all periods and in all countries,\nhas been held by religion. We have tried to make not only the expression\nand communication of truth impossible, but even the contemplation and\ndiscovery of it, by giving the minds of children in earliest childhood\ninto the hands of priests to be worked upon; to have the groove in which\ntheir fundamental thoughts are henceforth to run so firmly imprinted, as\nin principal matters, to become fixed and determined for a lifetime. I\nam sometimes shocked to see when I take into my hand the writings of\neven the most intelligent minds of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies, and especially if I have just left my oriental studies, how\nparalysed and hemmed in on all sides they are by Jewish notions.\nPrepared in this way, one cannot form any idea of the true philosophy!\n_Demop._ And if, moreover, this true philosophy were discovered,\nreligion would not cease to exist, as you imagine. There cannot be one\nsystem of metaphysics for everybody; the natural differences of\nintellectual power in addition to those of education make this\nimpossible. The great majority of mankind must necessarily be engaged in\nthat arduous bodily labour which is requisite in order to furnish the\nendless needs of the whole race. Not only does this leave the majority\nno time for education, for learning, or for reflection; but by virtue of\nthe strong antagonism between merely physical and intellectual\nqualities, much excessive bodily labour blunts the understanding and\nmakes it heavy, clumsy, and awkward, and consequently incapable of\ngrasping any other than perfectly simple and palpable matters. At least\nnine-tenths of the human race comes under this category. People require\na system of metaphysics, that is, an account of the world and our\nexistence, because such an account belongs to the most natural\nrequirements of mankind. They require also a popular system of\nmetaphysics, which, in order for it to be this, must combine many rare\nqualities; for instance, it must be exceedingly lucid, and yet in the\nright places be obscure, nay, to a certain extent, impenetrable; then a\ncorrect and satisfying moral system must be combined with its dogmas;\nabove everything, it must bring inexhaustible consolation in suffering\nand death. It follows from this that it can only be true in _sensu\nallegorico_ and not in _sensu proprio_. Further, it must have the\nsupport of an authority which is imposing by its great age, by its\ngeneral recognition, by its documents, together with their tone and\nstatements--qualities which are so infinitely difficult to combine that\nmany a man, if he stopped to reflect, would not be so ready to help to\nundermine a religion, but would consider it the most sacred treasure of\nthe people. If any one wants to criticise religion he should always bear\nin mind the nature of the great masses for which it is destined, and\npicture to himself their complete moral and intellectual inferiority. It\nis incredible how far this inferiority goes and how steadily a spark of\ntruth will continue to glimmer even under the crudest veiling of\nmonstrous fables and grotesque ceremonies, adhering indelibly, like the\nperfume of musk, to everything which has come in contact with it. As an\nillustration of this, look at the profound wisdom which is revealed in\nthe Upanishads, and then look at the mad idolatry in the India of\nto-day, as is revealed in its pilgrimages, processions, and festivities,\nor at the mad and ludicrous doings of the Saniassi of the present time.\nNevertheless, it cannot be denied that in all this madness and absurdity\nthere yet lies something that is hidden from view, something that is in\naccordance with, or a reflection of the profound wisdom that has been\nmentioned. It requires this kind of dressing-up for the great brute\nmasses. In this antithesis we have before us the two poles of\nhumanity:--the wisdom of the individual and the bestiality of the\nmasses, both of which, however, find their point of harmony in the moral\nkingdom. Who has not thought of the saying from the Kurral--\"Vulgar\npeople look like men; but I have never seen anything like them.\" The\nmore highly cultured man may always explain religion to himself _cum\ngrano salis_; the man of learning, the thoughtful mind, may, in secret,\nexchange it for a philosophy. And yet _one_ philosophy would not do for\neverybody; each philosophy by the laws of affinity attracts a public to\nwhose education and mental capacities it is fitted. So there is always\nan inferior metaphysical system of the schools for the educated\nplebeians, and a higher system for the _\u00e9lite_. Kant's lofty doctrine,\nfor example, was degraded to meet the requirements of the schools, and\nruined by Fries, Krug, Salat, and similar people. In short, Goethe's\ndictum is as applicable here as anywhere: _One does not suit all_. Pure\nbelief in revelation and pure metaphysics are for the two extremes; and\nfor the intermediate steps mutual modifications of both in countless\ncombinations and gradations. The immeasurable differences which nature\nand education place between men have made this necessary.\n_Phil._ This point of view reminds me seriously of the mysteries of the\nancients which you have already mentioned; their aim at bottom seems to\nhave lain in remedying the evil arising out of the differences of mental\ncapacities and education. Their plan was to single out of the great\nmultitude a few people, to whom the unveiled truth was absolutely\nincomprehensible, and to reveal the truth to them up to a certain point;\nthen out of these they singled out others to whom they revealed more, as\nthey were able to grasp more; and so on up to the Epopts. And so we got\n\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1. The plan was based on a\ncorrect knowledge of the intellectual inequality of mankind.\n_Demop_. To a certain extent the education in our lower, middle, and\nhigh schools represents the different forms of initiation into the\nmysteries.\n_Phil_. Only in a very approximate way, and this only in so far as\nsubjects of higher knowledge were written about exclusively in Latin.\nBut since that has ceased to be so all the mysteries are profaned.\n_Demop_. However that may be, I wish to remind you, in speaking of\nreligion, that you should grasp it more from the practical and less from\nthe theoretical side. Personified metaphysics may be religion's enemy,\nyet personified morality will be its friend. Perhaps the metaphysics in\nall religions is false; but the morality in all is true. This is to be\nsurmised from the fact that in their metaphysics they contradict each\nother, while in their morality they agree.\n_Phil_. Which furnishes us with a proof of the rule of logic, that a\ntrue conclusion may follow from false premises.\n_Demop_. Well, stick to your conclusion, and be always mindful that\nreligion has two sides. If it can't stand when looked at merely from the\ntheoretical--in other words, from its intellectual side, it appears, on\nthe other hand, from the moral side as the only means of directing,\ntraining, and pacifying those races of animals gifted with reason, whose\nkinship with the ape does not exclude a kinship with the tiger. At the\nsame time religion is, in general, a sufficient satisfaction for their\ndull metaphysical needs. You appear to me to have no proper idea of the\ndifference, wide as the heavens apart, of the profound breach between\nyour learned man, who is enlightened and accustomed to think, and the\nheavy, awkward, stupid, and inert consciousness of mankind's beasts of\nburden, whose thoughts have taken once and for all the direction of fear\nabout their maintenance, and cannot be put in motion in any other; and\nwhose muscular power is so exclusively exercised that the nervous power\nwhich produces intelligence is thereby greatly reduced. People of this\nkind must absolutely have something that they can take hold of on the\nslippery and thorny path of their life, some sort of beautiful fable by\nmeans of which things can be presented to them which their crude\nintelligence could most certainly only understand in picture and\nparable. It is impossible to approach them with subtle explanations and\nfine distinctions. If you think of religion in this way, and bear in\nmind that its aims are extremely practical and only subordinately\ntheoretical, it will seem to you worthy of the highest respect.\n_Phil_. A respect which would finally rest on the principle that the end\nsanctifies the means. However, I am not in favour of a compromise on a\nbasis of that sort. Religion may be an excellent means of curbing and\ncontrolling the perverse, dull, and malicious creatures of the biped\nrace; in the eyes of the friend of truth every _fraus_, be it ever so\n_pia_, must be rejected. It would be an odd way to promote virtue\nthrough the medium of lies and deception. The flag to which I have sworn\nis truth. I shall remain faithful to it everywhere, and regardless of\nsuccess, I shall fight for light and truth. If I see religion hostile, I\nshall--\n_Demop_. But you will not! Religion is not a deception; it is true, and\nthe most important of all truths. But because, as has already been said,\nits doctrines are of such a lofty nature that the great masses cannot\ngrasp them immediately; because, I say, its light would blind the\nordinary eye, does it appear concealed in the veil of allegory and teach\nthat which is not exactly true in itself, but which is true according to\nthe meaning contained in it: and understood in this way religion is the\ntruth.\n_Phil_. That would be very probable, if it were allowed to be true only\nin an allegorical sense. But it claims to be exactly true, and true in\nthe proper sense of the word: herein lies the deception, and it is here\nthat the friend of truth must oppose it.\n_Demop_. But this deception is a _conditio sine qua non_. If religion\nadmitted that it was merely the allegorical meaning in its doctrines\nthat was true, it would be deprived of all efficacy, and such rigorous\ntreatment would put an end to its invaluable and beneficial influence on\nthe morals and feelings of mankind. Instead of insisting on that with\npedantic obstinacy, look at its great achievements in a practical way\nboth as regards morality and feelings, as a guide to conduct, as a\nsupport and consolation to suffering humanity in life and death. How\ngreatly you should guard against rousing suspicion in the masses by\ntheoretical wrangling, and thereby finally taking from them what is an\ninexhaustible source of consolation and comfort to them; which in their\nhard lot they need very much more than we do: for this reason alone,\nreligion ought not to be attacked.\n_Phil_. With this argument Luther could have been beaten out of the\nfield when he attacked the selling of indulgences; for the letters of\nindulgence have furnished many a man with irreparable consolation and\nperfect tranquillity, so that he joyfully passed away with perfect\nconfidence in the little packet of them which he firmly held in his hand\nas he lay dying, convinced that in them he had so many cards of\nadmission into all the nine heavens. What is the use of grounds of\nconsolation and peacefulness over which is constantly hanging the\nDamocles-sword of deception? The truth, my friend, the truth alone holds\ngood, and remains constant and faithful; it is the only solid\nconsolation; it is the indestructible diamond.\n_Demop_. Yes, if you had truth in your pocket to bless us with whenever\nwe asked for it. But what you possess are only metaphysical systems in\nwhich nothing is certain but the headaches they cost. Before one takes\nanything away one must have something better to put in its place.\n_Phil_. I wish you would not continually say that. To free a man from\nerror does not mean to take something from him, but to give him\nsomething. For knowledge that something is wrong is a truth. No error,\nhowever, is harmless; every error will cause mischief sooner or later to\nthe man who fosters it. Therefore do not deceive any one, but rather\nadmit you are ignorant of what you do not know, and let each man form\nhis own dogmas for himself. Perhaps they will not turn out so bad,\nespecially as they will rub against each other and mutually rectify\nerrors; at any rate the various opinions will establish tolerance. Those\nmen who possess both knowledge and capacity may take up the study of\nphilosophy, or even themselves advance the history of philosophy.\n_Demop_. That would be a fine thing! A whole nation of naturalised\nmetaphysicians quarrelling with each other, and _eventualiter_ striking\neach other.\n_Phil_. Well, a few blows here and there are the sauce of life, or at\nleast a very slight evil compared with priestly government--prosecution\nof heretics, plundering of the laity, courts of inquisition, crusades,\nreligious wars, massacres of St. Bartholomew, and the like. They have\nbeen the results of chartered popular metaphysics: therefore I still\nhold that one cannot expect to get grapes from thistles, or good from\nlies and deception.\n_Demop_. How often must I repeat that religion is not a lie, but the\ntruth itself in a mythical, allegorical dress? But with respect to your\nplan of each man establishing his own religion, I had still something to\nsay to you, that a particularism like this is totally and absolutely\nopposed to the nature of mankind, and therefore would abolish all social\norder. Man is an _animal metaphysicum_--in other words, he has\nsurpassingly great metaphysical requirements; accordingly he conceives\nlife above all in its metaphysical sense, and from that standpoint\nwishes to grasp everything. Accordingly, odd as it may sound with regard\nto the uncertainty of all dogmas, accord in the fundamental elements of\nmetaphysics is the principal thing, in so much as it is only among\npeople who hold the same views on this question that a genuine and\nlasting fellowship is possible. As a result of this, nations resemble\nand differ from each other more in religion than in government, or even\nlanguage. Consequently, the fabric of society, the State, will only be\nperfectly firm when it has for a basis a system of metaphysics\nuniversally acknowledged. Such a system, naturally, can only be a\npopular metaphysical one--that is, a religion. It then becomes\nidentified with the government, with all the general expressions of the\nnational life, as well as with all sacred acts of private life. This was\nthe case in ancient India, among the Persians, Egyptians, Jews, also the\nGreeks and Romans, and it is still the case among the Brahman, Buddhist,\nand Mohammedan nations. There, are three doctrines of faith in China, it\nis true, and the one that has spread the most, namely, Buddhism, is\nexactly the doctrine that is least protected by the State; yet there is\na saying in China that is universally appreciated and daily applied,\n_the three doctrines are only one_--in other words, they agree in the\nmain thing. The Emperor confesses all three at the same time, and agrees\nwith them all. Europe is the confederacy of _Christian_ States;\nChristianity is the basis of each of its members and the common bond of\nall; hence Turkey, although it is in Europe, is really not to be\nreckoned in it. Similarly the European princes are such \"by the grace of\nGod,\" and the Pope is the delegate of God; accordingly, as his throne\nwas the highest, he wished all other thrones to be looked upon only as\nheld in fee from him. Similarly Archbishops and Bishops, as such, had\ntemporal authority, just as they have still in England a seat and voice\nin the Upper House; Protestant rulers are, as such, heads of their\nchurches; in England a few years ago this was a girl of eighteen. By the\nrevolt from the Pope, the Reformation shattered the European structure,\nand, in particular, dissolved the true unity of Germany by abolishing\nits common faith; this unity, which had as a matter of fact come to\ngrief, had accordingly to be replaced later by artificial and purely\npolitical bonds. So you see how essentially connected is unity of faith\nwith common order and every state. It is everywhere the support of the\nlaws and the constitution--that is to say, the foundation of the social\nstructure, which would stand with difficulty if faith did not lend power\nto the authority of the government and the importance of the ruler.\n_Phil_. Oh, yes, princes look upon God as a goblin, wherewith to\nfrighten grown-up children to bed when nothing else is of any avail; it\nis for this reason that they depend so much on God. All right; meanwhile\nI should like to advise every ruling lord to read through, on a certain\nday every six months, the fifteenth chapter of the First Book of Samuel,\nearnestly and attentively; so that he may always have in mind what it\nmeans to support the throne on the altar. Moreover, since burning at the\nstake, that _ultima ratio theologorum_, is a thing of the past, this\nmode of government has lost its efficacy. For, as you know, religions\nare like glowworms: before they can shine it must be dark. A certain\ndegree of general ignorance is the condition of every religion, and is\nthe element in which alone it is able to exist. While, as soon as\nastronomy, natural science, geology, history, knowledge of countries and\nnations have spread their light universally, and philosophy is finally\nallowed to speak, every faith which is based on miracle and revelation\nmust perish, and then philosophy will take its place. In Europe the day\nof knowledge and science dawned towards the end of the fifteenth century\nwith the arrival of the modern Greek philosophers, its sun rose higher\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which were so productive,\nand scattered the mists of the Middle Age. In the same proportion, both\nChurch and Faith were obliged to gradually disappear; so that in the\neighteenth century English and French philosophers became direct\nantagonists, until finally, under Frederick the Great, Kant came and\ntook away from religious belief the support it had formerly received\nfrom philosophy, and emancipated the _ancilla theologiae_ in that he\nattacked the question with German thoroughness and perseverance, whereby\nit received a less frivolous, that is to say, a more earnest tone. As a\nresult of this we see in the nineteenth century Christianity very much\nweakened, almost stripped entirely of serious belief, nay, fighting for\nits own existence; while apprehensive princes try to raise it up by an\nartificial stimulant, as the doctor tries to revive a dying man by the\naid of a drug. There is a passage from Condorcet's _Des Progr\u00e8s de\nl'esprit humain_, which seems to have been written as a warning to our\nepoch: _Le z\u00e8le religieux des philosophes et des grands n'\u00e9tait qu'une\nd\u00e9votion politique: et toute religion, qu'on se permet de d\u00e9fendre comme\nune croyance qu'il est utile de laisser au peuple, ne peut plus esp\u00e9rer\nqu'une agonie plus ou moins prolong\u00e9e_. In the whole course of the\nevents which I have pointed out you may always observe that belief and\nknowledge bear the same relation to each other as the two scales of a\nbalance: when the one rises the other must fall. The balance is so\nsensitive that it indicates momentary influences. For example, in the\nbeginning of this century the predatory excursions of French robbers\nunder their leader Buonaparte, and the great efforts that were requisite\nto drive them out and to punish them, had led to a temporary neglect of\nscience, and in consequence to a certain decrease in the general\npropagation of knowledge; the Church immediately began to raise her head\nagain and Faith to be revived, a revival partly of a poetical nature, in\nkeeping with the spirit of the times. On the other hand, in the more\nthan thirty years' peace that followed, leisure and prosperity promoted\nthe building up of science and the spread of knowledge in an exceptional\ndegree, so that the result was what I have said, the dissolution and\nthreatened fall of religion. Perhaps the time which has been so often\npredicted is not far distant, when religion will depart from European\nhumanity, like a nurse whose care the child has outgrown; it is now\nplaced in the hands of a tutor for instruction. For without doubt\ndoctrines of belief that are based only on authority, miracles, and\nrevelation are only of use and suitable to the childhood of humanity.\nThat a race, which all physical and historical data confirm as having\nbeen in existence only about a hundred times the life of a man sixty\nyears old, is still in its first childhood is a fact that every one will\nadmit.\n_Demop_. If instead of prophesying with undisguised pleasure the\ndownfall of Christianity, you would only consider how infinitely\nindebted European humanity is to it, and to the religion which, after\nthe lapse of some time, followed Christianity from its old home in the\nEast! Europe received from it a drift which had hitherto been unknown to\nit--it learnt the fundamental truth that life cannot be an\nend-in-itself, but that the true end of our existence lies beyond it.\nThe Greeks and Romans had placed this end absolutely in life itself, so\nthat, in this sense, they may most certainly be called blind heathens.\nCorrespondingly, all their virtues consist in what is serviceable to the\npublic, in what is useful; and Aristotle says quite na\u00efvely, \"_Those\nvirtues must necessarily be the greatest which are the most useful to\nothers_\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2,\n_Rhetor_. I. c. 9). This is why the ancients considered love for one's\ncountry the greatest virtue, although it is a very doubtful one, as it\nis made up of narrowness, prejudice, vanity, and an enlightened\nself-interest. Preceding the passage that has just been quoted,\nAristotle enumerates all the virtues in order to explain them\nindividually. They are _Justice, Courage, Moderation, Magnificence_\n(\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), _Magnanimity, Liberality, Gentleness, Reasonableness,\nand Wisdom_. How different from the Christian virtues! Even Plato,\nwithout comparison the most transcendental philosopher of pre-Christian\nantiquity, knows no higher virtue than _Justice_; he alone recommends it\nunconditionally and for its own sake, while all the other philosophers\nmake a happy life--_vita beata_--the aim of all virtue; and it is\nacquired through the medium of moral behaviour. Christianity released\nEuropean humanity from its superficial and crude absorption in an\nephemeral, uncertain, and hollow existence.\n... _coelumque tueri\nJussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus_.\nAccordingly, Christianity does not only preach Justice, but the _Love of\nMankind, Compassion, Charity, Reconciliation, Love of one's Enemies,\nPatience, Humility, Renunciation, Faith, and Hope_. Indeed, it went even\nfurther: it taught that the world was of evil and that we needed\ndeliverance; consequently it preached contempt of the world,\nself-denial, chastity, the giving up of one's own will, that is to say,\nturning away from life and its phantom-like pleasures; it taught further\nthe healing power of suffering, and that an instrument of torture is the\nsymbol of Christianity, I willingly admit that this serious and only\ncorrect view of life had spread in other forms throughout Asia thousands\nof years previously, independently of Christianity as it is still; but\nthis view of life was a new and tremendous revelation to European\nhumanity. For it is well known that the population of Europe consists of\nAsiatic races who, driven out from their own country, wandered away, and\nby degrees hit upon Europe: on their long wanderings they lost the\noriginal religion of their homes, and with it the correct view of life;\nand this is why they formed in another climate religions for themselves\nwhich were somewhat crude; especially the worship of Odin, the Druidic\nand the Greek religions, the metaphysical contents of which were small\nand shallow. Meanwhile there developed among the Greeks a quite special,\none might say an instinctive, sense of beauty, possessed by them alone\nof all the nations of the earth that have ever existed--a peculiar,\nfine, and correct sense of beauty, so that in the mouths of their poets\nand in the hands of their artists, their mythology took an exceptionally\nbeautiful and delightful form. On the other hand, the earnest, true, and\nprofound import of life was lost to the Greeks and Romans; they lived\nlike big children until Christianity came and brought them back to the\nserious side of life.\n_Phil_. And to form an idea of the result we need only compare antiquity\nwith the Middle Age that followed--that is, the time of Pericles with\nthe fourteenth century. It is difficult to believe that we have the same\nkind of beings before us. There, the finest development of humanity,\nexcellent constitutional regulations, wise laws, cleverly distributed\noffices, rationally ordered freedom, all the arts, as well as poetry and\nphilosophy, at their best; the creation of works which after thousands\nof years have never been equalled and are almost works of a higher order\nof beings, whom we can never approach; life embellished by the noblest\nfellowship, as is portrayed in the _Banquet_ of Xenophon. And now look\nat this side, if you can. Look at the time when the Church had\nimprisoned the minds, and violence the bodies of men, whereby knights\nand priests could lay the whole weight of life on the common beast of\nburden--the third estate. There you have club-law, feudalism, and\nfanaticism in close alliance, and in their train shocking uncertainty\nand darkness of mind, a corresponding intolerance, discord of faiths,\nreligious wars, crusades, persecution of heretics and inquisitions; as\nthe form of fellowship, chivalry, an amalgam of savagery and\nfoolishness, with its pedantic system of absurd affectations, its\ndegrading superstitions, and apish veneration for women; the survival of\nwhich is gallantry, deservedly requited by the arrogance of women; it\naffords to all Asiatics continual material for laughter, in which the\nGreeks would have joined. In the golden Middle Age the matter went as\nfar as a formal and methodical service of women and enjoined deeds of\nheroism, _cours d'amour_, bombastic Troubadour songs and so forth,\nalthough it is to be observed that these last absurdities, which have an\nintellectual side, were principally at home in France; while among the\nmaterial phlegmatic Germans the knights distinguished themselves more by\ndrinking and robbing. Drinking and hoarding their castles with plunder\nwere the occupations of their lives; and certainly there was no want of\nstupid love-songs in the courts. What has changed the scene so?\nMigration and Christianity.\n_Demop_. It is a good thing you reminded me of it. Migration was the\nsource of the evil, and Christianity the dam on which it broke.\nChristianity was the means of controlling and taming those raw, wild\nhordes who were washed in by the flood of migration. The savage man must\nfirst of all learn to kneel, to venerate, and to obey; it is only after\nthat, that he can be civilised. This was done in Ireland by St. Patrick,\nin Germany by Winifred the Saxon, who was a genuine Boniface. It was\nmigration of nations, this last movement of Asiatic races towards\nEurope, followed only by their fruitless attempts under Attila, Gengis\nKhan, and Timur, and, as a comic after-piece, by the gipsies: it was\nmigration of nations which swept away the humanity of the ancients.\nChristianity was the very principle which worked against this savagery,\njust as later, through the whole of the Middle Age, the Church and its\nhierarchy were extremely necessary to place a limit to the savagery and\nbarbarism of those lords of violence, the princes and knights: it was\nthe ice-breaker of this mighty flood. Still, the general aim of\nChristianity is not so much to make this life pleasant as to make us\nworthy of a better. It looks beyond this span of time, this fleeting\ndream, in order to lead us to eternal salvation. Its tendency is ethical\nin the highest sense of the word, a tendency which had hitherto been\nunknown in Europe; as I have already pointed out to you by comparing the\nmorality and religion of the ancients with those of Christianity.\n_Phil_. That is right so far as theory is concerned; but look at the\npractice. In comparison with the Christian centuries that followed, the\nancient world was undoubtedly less cruel than the Middle Age, with its\ndeaths by frightful torture, its countless burnings at the stake;\nfurther, the ancients were very patient, thought very highly of justice,\nand frequently sacrificed themselves for their country, showed traits of\nmagnanimity of every kind, and such genuine humanity, that, up to the\npresent time, an acquaintance with their doings and thoughts is called\nthe study of Humanity. Religious wars, massacres, crusades,\ninquisitions, as well as other persecutions, the extermination of the\noriginal inhabitants of America and the introduction of African slaves\nin their place, were the fruits of Christianity, and among the ancients\none cannot find anything analogous to this, anything to counterpoise it;\nfor the slaves of the ancients, the _familia_, the _vernae_, were a\nsatisfied race and faithfully devoted to their masters, and as widely\ndistinct from the miserable negroes of the sugar plantations, which are\na disgrace to humanity, as they were in colour. The censurable\ntoleration of pederasty, for which one chiefly reproaches the morality\nof the ancients, is a trifle compared with the Christian horrors I have\ncited, and is not so rare among people of to-day as it appears to be.\nCan you then, taking everything into consideration, maintain that\nhumanity has really become morally better by Christianity?\n_Demop_. If the result has not everywhere corresponded with the purity\nand accuracy of the doctrine, it may be because this doctrine has been\ntoo noble, too sublime for humanity, and its aim set too high: to be\nsure, it was much easier to comply with heathen morality or with the\nMohammedan. It is precisely what is most elevated that is the most open\nto abuse and deception--_abusus optimi pessimus_; and therefore those\nlofty doctrines have sometimes served as a pretext for the most\ndisgraceful transactions and veritable crimes. The downfall of the\nancient institutions, as well as of the arts and sciences of the old\nworld, is, as has been said, to be ascribed to the invasion of foreign\nbarbarians. Accordingly, it was inevitable that ignorance and savagery\ngot the upper hand; with the result that violence and fraud usurped\ntheir dominion, and knights and priests became a burden to mankind. This\nis partly to be explained by the fact that the new religion taught the\nlesson of eternal and not temporal welfare, that simplicity of heart was\npreferable to intellectual knowledge, and it was averse to all worldly\npleasures which are served by the arts and sciences. However, in so far\nas they could be made serviceable to religion they were promoted, and so\nflourished to a certain extent.\n_Phil_. In a very narrow sphere. The sciences were suspicious\ncompanions, and as such were placed under restrictions; while fond\nignorance, that element so necessary to the doctrines of faith, was\ncarefully nourished.\n_Demop_. And yet what humanity had hitherto acquired in the shape of\nknowledge, and handed down in the works of the ancients, was saved from\nruin by the clergy, especially by those in the monasteries. What would\nhave happened if Christianity had not come in just before the migration\nof nations?\n_Phil_. It would really be an extremely useful inquiry if some one, with\nthe greatest frankness and impartiality, tried to weigh exactly and\naccurately the advantages and disadvantages derived from religions. To\ndo this, it would be necessary to have a much greater amount of\nhistorical and psychological data than either of us has at our command.\nAcademies might make it a subject for a prize essay.\n_Demop_. They will take care not to do that.\n_Phil_. I am surprised to hear you say that, for it is a bad look-out\nfor religion. Besides, there are also academies which make it a secret\ncondition in submitting their questions that the prize should be given\nto the competitor who best understands the art of flattering them. If\nwe, then, could only get a statistician to tell us how many crimes are\nprevented yearly by religious motives, and how many by other motives.\nThere would be very few of the former. If a man feels himself tempted to\ncommit a crime, certainly the first thing which presents itself to his\nmind is the punishment he must suffer for it, and the probability that\nhe will be punished; after that comes the second consideration, that his\nreputation is at stake. If I am not mistaken, he will reflect by the\nhour on these two obstacles before religious considerations ever come\ninto his mind. If he can get away from these two first safeguards\nagainst crime, I am convinced that religion _alone_ will very rarely\nkeep him back from it.\n_Demop_. I believe, however, that it will do so very often; especially\nwhen its influence works through the medium of custom, and thereby\nimmediately makes a man shrink from the idea of committing a crime.\nEarly impressions cling to him. As an illustration of what I mean,\nconsider how many a man, and especially if he is of noble birth, will\noften, in order to fulfil some promise, make great sacrifices, which are\ninstigated solely by the fact that his father has often impressed it\nupon him in childhood that \"a man of honour, or a gentleman, or a\ncavalier, always keeps his word inviolate.\"\n_Phil_. And that won't work unless there is a certain innate _probitas_.\nYou must not ascribe to religion what is the result of innate goodness\nof character, by which pity for the one who would be affected by the\ncrime prevents a man from committing it. This is the genuine moral\nmotive, and as such it is independent of all religions.\n_Demop_. But even this moral motive has no effect on the masses unless\nit is invested with a religious motive, which, at any rate, strengthens\nit. However, without any such natural foundation, religious motives\noften in themselves alone prevent crime: this is not a matter of\nsurprise to us in the case of the multitude, when we see that even\npeople of good education sometimes come under the influence, not indeed\nof religious motives, which fundamentally are at least allegorically\ntrue, but of the most absurd superstitions, by which they are guided\nthroughout the whole of their lives; as, for instance, undertaking\nnothing on a Friday, refusing to sit down thirteen at table, obeying\nchance omens, and the like: how much more likely are the masses to be\nguided by such things. You cannot properly conceive the great\nlimitations of the raw mind; its interior is entirely dark, especially\nif, as is often the case, a bad, unjust, and wicked heart is its\nfoundation. Men like these, who represent the bulk of humanity, must be\ndirected and controlled meanwhile, as well as possible, even if it be by\nreally superstitious motives, until they become susceptible to truer and\nbetter ones. Of the direct effect of religion, one may give as an\ninstance a common occurrence in Italy, namely, that of a thief being\nallowed to replace what he has stolen through the medium of his\nconfessor, who makes this the condition of his absolution. Then think of\nthe case of an oath, where religion shows a most decided influence:\nwhether it be because a man places himself expressly in the position of\na mere _moral being_, and as such regards himself as solemnly appealed\nto,--as seems to be the case in France, where the form of the oath is\nmerely \"_je le jure_\"; and among the Quakers, whose solemn \"yea\" or\n\"nay\" takes the place of the oath;--or whether it is because a man\nreally believes he is uttering something that will forfeit his eternal\nhappiness,--a belief which is obviously only the investiture of the\nformer feeling. At any rate, religious motives are a means of awakening\nand calling forth his moral nature. A man will frequently consent to\ntake a false oath, but suddenly refuse to do so when it comes to the\npoint; whereby truth and right come off victorious.\n_Phil_. But false oaths are still oftener sworn, whereby truth and right\nare trodden underfoot with the clear knowledge of all the witnesses of\nthe act. An oath is the jurist's metaphysical _pons asinorum_, and like\nthis should be used as seldom as ever possible. When it cannot be\navoided, it should be taken with great solemnity, always in the presence\nof the clergy--nay, even in a church or in a chapel adjoining the court\nof justice.... This is precisely why the French abstract formulary of\nthe oath is of no value. By the way, you are right to cite the oath as\nan undeniable example of the practical efficacy of religion. I must, in\nspite of everything you have said, doubt whether the efficacy of\nreligion goes much beyond this. Just think, if it were suddenly declared\nby public proclamation that all criminal laws were abolished; I believe\nthat neither you nor I would have the courage to go home from here alone\nunder the protection of religious motives. On the other hand, if in a\nsimilar way all religions were declared to be untrue; we would, under\nthe protection of the laws alone, live on as formerly, without any\nspecial increase in our fears and measures of precaution. But I will\neven go further: religions have very frequently a decidedly demoralising\ninfluence. It may be said generally that duties towards God are the\nreverse of duties towards mankind; and that it is very easy to make up\nfor lack of good behaviour towards men by adulation of God. Accordingly,\nwe see in all ages and countries that the great majority of mankind find\nit much easier to beg admission into Heaven by prayers than to deserve\nit by their actions. In every religion it soon comes to be proclaimed\nthat it is not so much moral actions as faith, ceremonies, and rites of\nevery kind that are the immediate objects of the Divine will; and indeed\nthe latter, especially if they are bound up with the emoluments of the\nclergy, are considered a substitute for the former. The sacrifice of\nanimals in temples, or the saying of masses, the erection of chapels or\ncrosses by the roadside, are soon regarded as the most meritorious\nworks; so that even a great crime may be expiated by them, as also by\npenance, subjection to priestly authority, confessions, pilgrimages,\ndonations to the temple and its priests, the building of monasteries and\nthe like; until finally the clergy appear almost only as mediators in\nthe corruption of the gods. And if things do not go so far as that,\nwhere is the religion whose confessors do not consider prayers, songs of\npraise, and various kinds of devotional exercise, at any rate, a partial\nsubstitute for moral conduct? Look at England, for instance, where the\naudacious priestcraft has mendaciously identified the Christian Sunday\nwith the Jewish Sabbath, in spite of the fact that it was ordained by\nConstantine the Great in opposition to the Jewish Sabbath, and even took\nits name, so that Jehovah's ordinances for the Sabbath--_i.e._, the day\non which the Almighty rested, tired after His six days' work, making it\ntherefore _essentially the last day_ of the week--might be conferred on\nthe Christian Sunday, the _dies solis_, the first day of the week which\nthe sun opens in glory, the day of devotion and joy. The result of this\nfraud is that in England \"Sabbath breaking,\" or the \"desecration of the\nSabbath,\" that is, the slightest occupation, whether it be of a useful\nor pleasurable nature, and any kind of game, music, knitting, or worldly\nbook, are on Sundays regarded as great sins. Must not the ordinary man\nbelieve that if, as his spiritual guides impress upon him, he never\nfails in a \"strict observance of the holy Sabbath and a regular\nattendance on Divine Service,\"--in other words, if he invariably whiles\naway his time on a Sunday, and never fails to sit two hours in church to\nlisten to the same Litany for the thousandth time, and to babble it with\nthe rest _a tempo_, he may reckon on indulgence in here and there little\nsins which he at times allows himself? Those devils in human form, the\nslave-owners and slave-traders in the Free States of North America (they\nshould be called the Slave States), are, in general, orthodox, pious\nAnglicans, who look upon it as a great sin to work on Sundays; and\nconfident in this, and their regular attendance at church, they expect\nto gain eternal happiness. The demoralising influence of religion is\nless problematical than its moral influence. On the other hand, how\ngreat and how certain that moral influence must be to make amends for\nthe horrors and misery which religions, especially the Christian and\nMohammedan religions, have occasioned and spread over the earth! Think\nof the fanaticism, of the endless persecutions, the religious wars, that\nsanguinary frenzy of which the ancients had no idea; then, think of the\nCrusades, a massacre lasting two hundred years, and perfectly\nunwarrantable, with its war-cry, _It is God's will_, so that it might\nget into its possession the grave of one who had preached love and\nendurance; think of the cruel expulsion and extermination of the Moors\nand Jews from Spain; think of the massacres, of the inquisitions and\nother heretical tribunals, the bloody and terrible conquests of the\nMohammedans in three different parts of the world, and the conquest of\nthe Christians in America, whose inhabitants were for the most part, and\nin Cuba entirely, exterminated; according to Las Casas, within forty\nyears twelve million persons were murdered--of course, all _in majorem\nDei gloriam_, and for the spreading of the Gospel, and because,\nmoreover, what was not Christian was not looked upon as human. It is\ntrue I have already touched upon these matters; but when in our day \"the\nLatest News from the Kingdom of God\" is printed, we shall not be tired\nof bringing older news to mind. And in particular, let us not forget\nIndia, that sacred soil, that cradle of the human race, at any rate of\nthe race to which we belong, where first Mohammedans, and later\nChristians, were most cruelly infuriated against the followers of the\noriginal belief of mankind; and the eternally lamentable, wanton, and\ncruel destruction and disfigurement of the most ancient temples and\nimages, still show traces of the monotheistic rage of the Mohammedans,\nas it was carried on from Marmud the Ghaznevid of accursed memory, down\nto Aureng Zeb, the fratricide, whom later the Portuguese Christians\nfaithfully tried to imitate by destroying the temples and the _auto da\nf\u00e9_ of the inquisition at Goa. Let us also not forget the chosen people\nof God, who, after they had, by Jehovah's express and special command,\nstolen from their old and faithful friends in Egypt the gold and silver\nvessels which had been lent to them, made a murderous and predatory\nexcursion into the Promised Land, with Moses at their head, in order to\ntear it from the rightful owners, also at Jehovah's express and repeated\ncommands, knowing no compassion, and relentlessly murdering and\nexterminating all the inhabitants, even the women and children (Joshua\nx., xi.); just because they were not circumcised and did not know\nJehovah, which was sufficient reason to justify every act of cruelty\nagainst them. For the same reason, in former times the infamous roguery\nof the patriarch Jacob and his chosen people against Hamor, King of\nShalem, and his people is recounted to us with glory, precisely because\nthe people were unbelievers. Truly, it is the worst side of religions\nthat the believers of one religion consider themselves allowed\neverything against the sins of every other, and consequently treat them\nwith the utmost viciousness and cruelty; the Mohammedans against the\nChristians and Hindoos; the Christians against the Hindoos, Mohammedans,\nAmericans, Negroes, Jews, heretics, and the like. Perhaps I go too far\nwhen I say _all_ religions; for in compliance with truth, I must add\nthat the fanatical horrors, arising from religion, are only perpetrated\nby the followers of the monotheistic religions, that is, of Judaism and\nits two branches, Christianity and Islamism. The same is not reported of\nthe Hindoos and Buddhists, although we know, for instance, that Buddhism\nwas driven out about the fifth century of our era by the Brahmans from\nits original home in the southernmost part of the Indian peninsula, and\nafterwards spread over the whole of Asia; yet we have, so far as I know,\nno definite information of any deeds of violence, of wars and cruelties\nby which this was brought about. This may, most certainly, be ascribed\nto the obscurity in which the history of those countries is veiled; but\nthe extremely mild character of their religion, which continually\nimpresses upon us to be forbearing towards _every living thing_, as well\nas the circumstance that Brahmanism properly admits no proselytes by\nreason of its caste system, leads us to hope that its followers may\nconsider themselves exempt from shedding blood to any great extent, and\nfrom cruelty in any form. Spence Hardy, in his excellent book on\n_Eastern Monachism_, p. 412, extols the extraordinary tolerance of the\nBuddhists, and adds his assurance that the annals of Buddhism furnish\nfewer examples of religious persecution than those of any other\nreligion. As a matter of fact, intolerance is only essential to\nmonotheism: an only god is by his nature a jealous god, who cannot\npermit any other god to exist. On the other hand, polytheistic gods are\nby their nature tolerant: they live and let live; they willingly\ntolerate their colleagues as being gods of the same religion, and this\ntolerance is afterwards extended to alien gods, who are, accordingly,\nhospitably received, and later on sometimes attain even the same rights\nand privileges; as in the case of the Romans, who willingly accepted and\nvenerated Phrygian, Egyptian, and other foreign gods. Hence it is the\nmonotheistic religions alone that furnish us with religious wars,\npersecutions, and heretical tribunals, and also with the breaking of\nimages, the destruction of idols of the gods; the overthrowing of Indian\ntemples and Egyptian colossi, which had looked on the sun three thousand\nyears; and all this because a jealous God had said: \"_Thou shalt make no\ngraven image_,\" etc. To return to the principal part of the matter: you\nare certainly right in advocating the strong metaphysical needs of\nmankind; but religions appear to me to be not so much a satisfaction as\nan abuse of those needs. At any rate we have seen that, in view of the\nprogress of morality, its advantages are for the most part\nproblematical, while its disadvantages, and especially the enormities\nwhich have appeared in its train, are obvious. Of course the matter\nbecomes quite different if we consider the utility of religion as a\nmainstay of thrones; for in so far as these are bestowed \"by the grace\nof God,\" altar and throne are closely related. Accordingly, every wise\nprince who loves his throne and his family will walk before his people\nas a type of true religion; just as even Machiavelli, in the eighteenth\nchapter of his book, urgently recommended religion to princes. Moreover,\nit may be added that revealed religions are related to philosophy,\nexactly as the sovereigns by the grace of God are to the sovereignty of\nthe people; and hence the two former terms of the parallel are in\nnatural alliance.\n_Demop_. Oh, don't adopt that tone! But consider that in doing so you\nare blowing the trumpet of ochlocracy and anarchy, the arch-enemy of all\nlegislative order, all civilisation, and all humanity.\n_Phil_. You are right. It was only a sophism, or what the fencing-master\ncalls a feint. I withdraw it therefore. But see how disputing can make\neven honest men unjust and malicious. So let us cease.\n_Demop_. It is true I regret, after all the trouble I have taken, that I\nhave not altered your opinion in regard to religion; on the other hand,\nI can assure you that everything you have brought forward has not shaken\nmy conviction of its high value and necessity.\n_Phil_. I believe you; for as it is put in Hudibras:\n\"He that complies against his will\nIs of his own opinion still.\"\nI find consolation, however, in the fact that in controversies and in\ntaking mineral waters, it is the after-effects that are the true ones.\n_Demop_. I hope the after-effect may prove to be beneficial in your\ncase.\n_Phil_. That might be so if I could only digest a Spanish proverb.\n_Demop_. And that is?\n_Phil._ _Detras de la cruz est\u00e1 el Diablo_.\n_Demop_. Which means?\n_Phil_ Wait--\"Behind the cross stands the devil.\"\n_Demop_. Come, don't let us separate from each other with sarcasms, but\nrather let us allow that religion, like Janus, or, better still, like\nthe Brahman god of death, Yama, has two faces, and like him, one very\nfriendly and one very sullen. Each of us, however, has only fixed his\neyes on one.\n_Phil_. You are right, old fellow.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[13] _De Anim. Mundi_, p. 104, d. Steph.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.\nEvery animal, and especially man, requires, in order to exist and get on\nin the world, a certain fitness and proportion between his will and his\nintellect. The more exact and true this fitness and proportion are by\nnature, the easier, safer, and pleasanter it will be for him to get\nthrough the world. At the same time, a mere approximation to this exact\npoint will protect him from destruction. There is, in consequence, a\ncertain scope within the limits of exactness and fitness of this\nso-called proportion. The normal proportion is as follows. As the object\nof the intellect is to be the light and guide of the will on its path,\nthe more violent, impetuous, and passionate the inner force of the will,\nthe more perfect and clear must be the intellect which belongs to it; so\nthat the ardent efforts of the will, the glow of passion, the vehemence\nof affection, may not lead a man astray or drive him to do things that\nhe has not given his consideration or are wrong or will ruin him; which\nwill infallibly be the case when a very strong will is combined with a\nvery weak intellect. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, that is\nto say, a weak and feeble will, can agree and get on with little\nintellect; a moderate will only requires a moderate intellect. In\ngeneral, any disproportion between the will and intellect--that is to\nsay, any deviation from the normal proportion referred to--tends to make\na man unhappy; and the same thing happens when the disproportion is\nreversed. The development of the intellect to an abnormal degree of\nstrength and superiority, thereby making it out of all proportion to the\nwill, a condition which constitutes the essence of true genius, is not\nonly superfluous but actually an impediment to the needs and purposes of\nlife. This means that, in youth, excessive energy in grasping the\nobjective world, accompanied by a lively imagination and little\nexperience, makes the mind susceptible to exaggerated ideas and a prey\neven to chimeras; and this results in an eccentric and even fantastic\ncharacter. And when, later, this condition of mind no longer exists and\nsuccumbs to the teaching of experience, the genius will never feel so\nmuch at home or take up his position in the everyday world or in civic\nlife, and move with the ease of a man of normal intellect; indeed, he is\noften more apt to make curious mistakes. For the ordinary mind is so\nperfectly at home in the narrow circle of its own ideas and way of\ngrasping things that no one can control it in that circle; its\ncapacities always remain true to their original purpose, namely, to look\nafter the service of the will; therefore it applies itself unceasingly\nto this end without ever going beyond it. While the genius, as I have\nstated, is at bottom a _monstrum per excessum_; just as conversely the\npassionate, violent, and unintelligent man, the brainless savage, is a\n_monstrum per dejectum_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe _will_ to _live_, which forms the innermost kernel of every living\nbeing, is most distinctly apparent in the highest, that is to say in the\ncleverest, order of animals, and therefore in them we may see and\nconsider the nature of the will most clearly. For _below_ this order of\nanimals the will is not so prominent, and has a less degree of\nobjectivation; but _above_ the higher order of animals, I mean in men,\nwe get reason, and with reason reflection, and with this the faculty for\ndissimulation, which immediately throws a veil over the actions of the\nwill. But in outbursts of affection and passion the will exhibits itself\nunveiled. This is precisely why passion, when it speaks, always carries\nconviction, whatever the passion may be; and rightly so. For the same\nreason, the passions are the principal theme of poets and the\nstalking-horse of actors. And it is because the will is most striking in\nthe lower class of animals that we may account for our delight in dogs,\napes, cats, etc.; it is the absolute _na\u00efvet\u00e9_ of all their expressions\nwhich charms us so much.\nWhat a peculiar pleasure it affords us to see any free animal looking\nafter its own welfare unhindered, finding its food, or taking care of\nits young, or associating with others of its kind, and so on! This is\nexactly what ought to be and can be. Be it only a bird, I can look at it\nfor some time with a feeling of pleasure; nay, a water-rat or a frog,\nand with still greater pleasure a hedgehog, a weazel, a roe, or a deer.\nThe contemplation of animals delights us so much, principally because we\nsee in them our own existence very _much simplified_.\nThere is only one mendacious creature in the world--man. Every other is\ntrue and genuine, for it shows itself as it is, and expresses itself\njust as it feels. An emblematical or allegorical expression of this\nfundamental difference is to be found in the fact that all animals go\nabout in their natural state; this largely accounts for the happy\nimpression they make on us when we look at them; and as far as I myself\nam concerned, my heart always goes out to them, particularly if they are\nfree animals. Man, on the other hand, by his silly dress becomes a\nmonster; his very appearance is objectionable, enhanced by the unnatural\npaleness of his complexion,--the nauseating effect of his eating meat,\nof his drinking alcohol, his smoking, dissoluteness, and ailments. He\nstands out as a blot on Nature. And it was because the Greeks were\nconscious of this that they restricted themselves as far as possible in\nthe matter of dress.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMuch that is attributed to _force of habit_ ought rather to be put down\nto the constancy and immutability of original, innate character, whereby\nwe always do the _same_ thing under the same circumstances; which\nhappens the first as for the hundredth time in consequence of the same\nnecessity. While _force of habit_, in reality, is solely due to\n_indolence_ seeking to save the intellect and will the work, difficulty,\nand danger of making a fresh choice; so that we are made to do to-day\nwhat we did yesterday and have done a hundred times before, and of which\nwe know that it will gain its end.\nBut the truth of the matter lies deeper; for it can be explained more\nclearly than appears at first sight. The _power of inertia_ applied to\nbodies which may be moved by mechanical means only, becomes _force of\nhabit_ when applied to bodies which are moved by motives. The actions\nwhich we do out of sheer force of habit occur, as a matter of fact,\nwithout any individual separate motive exercised for the particular\ncase; hence we do not really think of them. It was only when each action\nat first took place that it had a motive; after that it became a habit;\nthe secondary after-effect of this motive is the present habit, which is\nsufficient to carry on the action; just as a body, set in motion by a\npush, does not need another push in order to enable it to continue its\nmotion; it will continue in motion for ever if it is not obstructed in\nany way. The same thing applies to animals; training is a habit which is\nforced upon them. The horse draws a cart along contentedly without being\nurged to do so; this motion is still the effect of those lashes with the\nwhip which incited him at first, but which by the law of inertia have\nbecome perpetuated as habit. There is really something more in all this\nthan a mere parable; it is the identity of the thing in question, that\nis to say of the will, at very different degrees of its objectivation,\nby which the same law of motion takes such different forms.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Viva muchos a\ufffdos!_ is the ordinary greeting in Spain, and it is usual\nthroughout the whole world to wish people a long life. It is not a\nknowledge of what life is that explains the origin of such a wish, but\nrather knowledge of what man is in his real nature: namely, _the will to\nlive_.\nThe wish which every one has, that he may be _remembered_ after his\ndeath, and which those people with aspirations have for _posthumous_\nfame, seems to me to arise from this tenacity to life. When they see\nthemselves cut off from every possibility of real existence they\nstruggle after a life which is still within their reach, even if it is\nonly an ideal--that is to say, an unreal one.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWe wish, more or less, to get to the end of everything we are interested\nin or occupied with; we are impatient to get to the end of it, and glad\nwhen it is finished. It is only the general end, the end of all ends,\nthat we wish, as a rule, as far off as possible.\n*       *       *       *       *\nEvery separation gives a foretaste of death, and every meeting a\nforetaste of the resurrection. This explains why even people who were\nindifferent to each other, rejoice so much when they meet again after\nthe lapse of twenty or thirty years.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe deep sorrow we feel on the death of a friend springs from the\nfeeling that in every individual there is a something which we cannot\ndefine, which is his alone and therefore _irreparable. Omne individuum\nineffabile_. The same applies to individual animals. A man who has by\naccident fatally wounded a favourite animal feels the most acute sorrow,\nand the animal's dying look causes him infinite pain.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt is possible for us to grieve over the death of our enemies and\nadversaries, even after the lapse of a long time, almost as much as over\nthe death of our friends--that is to say, if we miss them as witnesses\nof our brilliant success.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThat the sudden announcement of some good fortune may easily have a\nfatal effect on us is due to the fact that our happiness and unhappiness\ndepend upon the relation of our demands to what we get; accordingly, the\ngood things we possess, or are quite sure of possessing, are not felt to\nbe such, because the nature of all enjoyment is really only _negative_,\nand has only the effect of annulling pain; whilst, on the other hand,\nthe nature of pain or evil is really positive and felt immediately. With\nthe possession, or the certain prospect of it, our demands instantly\nrise and increase our desire for further possession and greater\nprospects. But if the mind is depressed by continual misfortune, and the\nclaims reduced to a _minimum_, good fortune that comes suddenly finds no\ncapacity for its acceptance. Neutralised by no previous claims, it now\nhas apparently a positive effect, and accordingly its whole power is\nexercised; hence it may disorganise the mind--that is to say, be fatal\nto it. This is why, as is well known, one is so careful to get a man\nfirst to hope for happiness before announcing it, then to suggest the\nprospect of it, then little by little make it known, until gradually all\nis known to him; every portion of the revelation loses the strength of\nits effect because it is anticipated by a demand, and room is still left\nfor more. In virtue of all this, it might be said that our stomach for\ngood fortune is bottomless, but the entrance to it is narrow. What has\nbeen said does not apply to sudden misfortunes in the same way. Since\nhope always resists them, they are for this reason rarely fatal. That\nfear does not perform an analogous office in cases of good fortune is\ndue to the fact that we are instinctively more inclined to hope than to\nfear; just as our eyes turn of themselves to light in preference to\ndarkness.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Hope_ is to confuse the desire that something should occur with the\nprobability that it will. Perhaps no man is free from this folly of the\nheart, which deranges the intellect's correct estimation of probability\nto such a degree as to make him think the event quite possible, even if\nthe chances are only a thousand to one. And still, an unexpected\nmisfortune is like a speedy death-stroke; while a hope that is always\nfrustrated, and yet springs into life again, is like death by slow\ntorture.\nHe who has given up hope has also given up fear; this is the meaning of\nthe expression _desperate_. It is natural for a man to have faith in\nwhat he wishes, and to have faith in it because he wishes it. If this\npeculiarity of his nature, which is both beneficial and comforting, is\neradicated by repeated hard blows of fate, and he is brought to a\nconverse condition, when he believes that something must happen because\nhe does not wish it, and what he wishes can never happen just because he\nwishes it; this is, in reality, the state which has been called\n_desperation_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThat we are so often mistaken in others is not always precisely due to\nour faulty judgment, but springs, as a rule as Bacon says, from\n_intellectus luminis sicci non est, sec recipit infusionem a voluntate\net affectibus_: for without knowing it, we are influenced for or against\nthem by trifles from the very beginning. It also often lies in the fact\nthat we do not adhere to the qualities which we really discover in them,\nbut conclude from these that there are others which we consider\ninseparable from, or at any rate incompatible with, them. For instance,\nwhen we discern generosity, we conclude there is honesty; from lying we\nconclude there is deception; from deception, stealing, and so on; and\nthis opens the door to many errors, partly because of the peculiarity of\nhuman nature, and partly because of the one-sidedness of our point of\nview. It is true that character is always consistent and connected; but\nthe roots of all its qualities lies too deep to enable one to decide\nfrom special data in a given case which qualities can, and which cannot\nexist together.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe use of the word _person_ in every European language to signify a\nhuman individual is unintentionally appropriate; _persona_ really means\na player's mask, and it is quite certain that no one shows himself as he\nis, but that each wears a mask and plays a _r\ufffdle_. In general, the whole\nof social life is a continual comedy, which the worthy find insipid,\nwhilst the stupid delight in it greatly.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt often happens that we blurt out things that may in some kind of way\nbe harmful to us, but we are silent about things that may make us look\nridiculous; because in this case effect follows very quickly on cause.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe ordinary man who has suffered injustice burns with a desire for\nrevenge; and it has often been said that revenge is sweet. This is\nconfirmed by the many sacrifices made merely for the sake of enjoying\nrevenge, without any intention of making good the injury that one has\nsuffered. The centaur Nessus utilised his last moments in devising an\nextremely clever revenge, and the fact that it was certain to be\neffective sweetened an otherwise bitter death. The same idea, presented\nin a more modern and plausible way, occurs in Bertolotti's novel, _Le\ndue Sorelle_ which has been translated into three languages. Walter\nScott expresses mankind's proneness to revenge in words as powerful as\nthey are true: \"Vengeance is the sweetest morsel to the mouth that ever\nwas cooked in hell!\" I shall now attempt a psychological explanation of\nrevenge. All the suffering that nature, chance, or fate have assigned to\nus does not, _ceteris paribus_, pain us so much as suffering which is\nbrought upon us by the arbitrary will of another. This is due to the\nfact that we regard nature and fate as the original rulers of the world;\nwe look upon what befalls us, through them, as something that might have\nbefallen every one else. Therefore in a case of suffering which arises\nfrom this source, we bemoan the fate of mankind in general more than we\ndo our own. On the other hand, suffering inflicted on us through the\narbitrary will of another is a peculiarly bitter addition to the pain or\ninjury caused, as it involves the consciousness of another's\nsuperiority, whether it be in strength or cunning, as opposed to our own\nweakness. If compensation is possible, it wipes out the injury; but that\nbitter addition, \"I must submit to that from you,\" which often hurts\nmore than the injury itself, is only to be neutralised by vengeance. For\nby injuring the man who has injured us, whether it be by force or\ncunning, we show our superiority, and thereby annul the proof of his.\nThis gives that satisfaction to the mind for which it has been\nthirsting. Accordingly, where there is much pride or vanity there will\nbe a great desire for revenge. But as the fulfilment of every wish\nproves to be more or less a delusion, so is also the wish for revenge.\nThe expected enjoyment is mostly embittered by pity; nay, gratified\nrevenge will often lacerate the heart and torment the mind, for the\nmotive which prompts the feeling of it is no longer active, and what is\nleft is the testimony of our wickedness.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe pain of an ungratified desire is small compared with that of\nrepentance; for the former has to face the immeasurable, open future;\nthe latter the past, which is closed irrevocably.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMoney is human happiness _in abstracto_; so that a man who is no longer\ncapable of enjoying it _in concrete_ gives up his whole heart to it.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMoroseness and melancholy are very opposite in nature; and melancholy is\nmore nearly related to happiness than to moroseness. Melancholy\nattracts; moroseness repels. Hypochondria not only makes us unreasonably\ncross and angry over things concerning the present; not only fills us\nwith groundless fears of imaginative mishaps for the future; but also\ncauses us to unjustly reproach ourselves concerning our actions in the\npast.\nHypochondria causes a man to be always searching for and racking his\nbrain about things that either irritate or torment him. The cause of it\nis an internal morbid depression, combined often with an inward\nrestlessness which is temperamental; when both are developed to their\nutmost, suicide is the result.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhat makes a man hard-hearted is this, that each man has, or fancies he\nhas, sufficient in his own troubles to bear. This is why people placed\nin happier circumstances than they have been used to are sympathetic and\ncharitable. But people who have always been placed in happy\ncircumstances are often the reverse; they have become so estranged to\nsuffering that they have no longer any sympathy with it; and hence it\nhappens that the poor sometimes show themselves more benevolent than the\nrich.\nOn the other hand, what makes a man so very _curious_, as may be seen in\nthe way he will spy into other people's affairs, is boredom, a condition\nwhich is diametrically opposed to suffering;--though envy also often\nhelps in creating curiosity.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAt times, it seems as though we wish for something, and at the same time\ndo not wish for it, so that we are at once both pleased and troubled\nabout it. For instance, if we have to undergo some decisive test in some\naffair or other, in which to come off victorious is of great importance\nto us; we both wish that the time to be tested were here, and yet dread\nthe idea of its coming. If it happens that the time, for once in a way,\nis postponed, we are both pleased and sorry, for although the\npostponement was unexpected, it, however, gives us momentary relief. We\nhave the same kind of feeling when we expect an important letter\ncontaining some decision of moment, and it fails to come.\nIn cases like these we are really controlled by two different motives;\nthe stronger but more remote being the desire to stand the test, and to\nhave the decision given in our favour; the weaker, which is closer at\nhand, the desire to be left in peace and undisturbed for the present,\nand consequently in further enjoyment of the advantage that hoping on in\nuncertainty has over what might possibly be an unhappy issue.\nConsequently, in this case the same happens to our moral vision as to\nour physical, when a smaller object near at hand conceals from view a\nbigger object some distance away.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe course and affairs of our individual life, in view of their true\nmeaning and connection, are like a piece of crude work in mosaic. So\nlong as one stands close in front of it, one cannot correctly see the\nobjects presented, or perceive their importance and beauty; it is only\nby standing some distance away that both come into view. And in the same\nway one often understands the true connection of important events in\none's own life, not while they are happening, or even immediately after\nthey have happened, but only a long time afterwards.\nIs this so, because we require the magnifying power of imagination, or\nbecause a general view can only be got by looking from a distance? or\nbecause one's emotions would otherwise carry one away? or because it is\nonly the school of experience that ripens our judgment? Perhaps all\nthese combined. But it is certain that it is only after many years that\nwe see the actions of others, and sometimes even our own, in their true\nlight. And as it is in one's own life, so it is in history.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhy is it, in spite of all the mirrors in existence, no man really knows\nwhat he looks like, and, therefore, cannot picture in his mind his own\nperson as he pictures that of an acquaintance? This is a difficulty\nwhich is thwarted at the very outset by _gnothi sauton--know thyself_.\nThis is undoubtedly partly due to the fact that a man can only see\nhimself in the glass by looking straight towards it and remaining quite\nstill; whereby the play of the eye, which is so important, and the real\ncharacteristic of the face is, to a great extent, lost. But co-operating\nwith this physical impossibility, there appears to be an ethical\nimpossibility analogous to it. A man cannot regard the reflection of his\nown face in the glass as if it were the face of _some one else_--which\nis the condition of his seeing himself _objectively_. This objective\nview rests with a profound feeling on the egoist's part, as a moral\nbeing, that what he is looking at is _not himself_; which is requisite\nfor his perceiving all his defects as they really are from a purely\nobjective point of view; and not until, then can he see his face\nreflected as it really and truly is. Instead of that, when a man sees\nhis own person in the glass the egoistic side of him always whispers,\n_It is not somebody else, but I myself_, which has the effect of a _noli\nme tangere_, and prevents his taking a purely objective view. Without\nthe leaven of a grain of malice, it does not seem possible to look at\noneself objectively.\n*       *       *       *       *\nNo one knows what capacities he possesses for suffering and doing until\nan opportunity occurs to bring them into play; any more than he imagines\nwhen looking into a perfectly smooth pond with a mirror-like surface,\nthat it can tumble and toss and rush from rock to rock, or leap as high\ninto the air as a fountain;--any more than in ice-cold water he suspects\nlatent warmth.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThat line of Ovid's,\n\"_Pronaque cum spectent animalia cetera terram_,\"\nis only applicable in its true physical sense to animals; but in a\nfigurative and spiritual sense, unfortunately, to the great majority of\nmen too. Their thoughts and aspirations are entirely devoted to physical\nenjoyment and physical welfare, or to various personal interests which\nreceive their importance from their relation to the former; but they\nhave no interests beyond these. This is not only shown in their way of\nliving and speaking, but also in their look, the expression of their\nphysiognomy, their gait and gesticulations; everything about them\nproclaims _in terram prona!_ Consequently it is not to them, but only to\nthose nobler and more highly endowed natures, those men who really think\nand observe things round them, and are the exceptions in the human race,\nthat the following lines are applicable:\n\"_Os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri\nJussitt et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus_.\"\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhy is \"_common_\" an expression of contempt? And why are _\"uncommon,\"\n\"extraordinary,\" \"distinguished,\"_ expressions of approbation? Why is\neverything that is common contemptible?\n_Common_, in its original sense, means that which is peculiar and common\nto the whole species, that is to say that which is innate in the\nspecies. Accordingly, a man who has no more qualities than those of the\nhuman species in general is a \"_common man_\" \"Ordinary man\" is a much\nmilder expression, and is used more in reference to what is\nintellectual, while _common_ is used more in a moral sense.\nWhat value can a being have that is nothing more than like millions of\nits kind? Millions? Nay, an infinitude, an endless number of beings,\nwhich Nature in _secula seculorum_ unceasingly sends bubbling forth from\nher inexhaustible source; as generous with them as the smith with the\ndross that flies round his anvil.\nSo it is evidently only right that a being which has no other qualities\nthan those of the species, should make no claim to any other existence\nthan that confined to and conditioned by the species.\nI have already several times explained[14] that whilst animals have only\nthe generic character, it falls to man's share alone to have an\nindividual character. Nevertheless, in most men there is in reality very\nlittle individual character; and they may be almost all classified. _Ce\nsont des esp\u00e8ces_. Their desires and thoughts, like their faces, are\nthose of the whole species--at any rate, those of the class of men to\nwhich they belong, and they are therefore of a trivial, common nature,\nand exist in thousands. Moreover, as a rule one can tell pretty exactly\nbeforehand what they will say and do. They have no individual stamp:\nthey are like manufactured goods. If, then, their nature is absorbed in\nthat of the species, must not their existence be too? The curse of\nvulgarity reduces man to the level of animals, for his nature and\nexistence are merged in that of the species only. It is taken for\ngranted that anything that is high, great, or noble by its very nature\nstands isolated in a world where no better expression can be found to\nsignify what is base and paltry than the term which I have mentioned as\nbeing generally used--namely, _common_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAccording as our intellectual energy is strained or relaxed will life\nappear to us either so short, petty, and fleeting, that nothing can\nhappen of sufficient importance to affect our feelings; nothing is of\nany importance to us--be it pleasure, riches, or even fame, and however\nmuch we may have failed, we cannot have lost much; or _vice vers\u00e2,_ life\nwill appear so long, so important, so all in all, so grave, and so\ndifficult that we throw ourselves into it with our whole soul, so that\nwe may get a share of its possessions, make ourselves sure of its\nprizes, and carry out our plans. The latter is the immanent view of\nlife; it is what Gracian means by his expression, _tomar muy de veras el\nvivir_ (life is to be taken seriously); while for the former, the\ntranscendental view, Ovid's _non est tanti_ is a good expression;\nPlato's a still better, \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f11\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2\n\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 (_nihil, in rebus humanis, magno studio dignum est_).\nThe former state of mind is the result of the intellect having gained\nascendency over consciousness, where, freed from the mere service of the\nwill, it grasps the phenomena of life objectively, and so cannot fail to\nsee clearly the emptiness and futility of it. On the other hand, it is\nthe _will_ that rules in the other condition of mind, and it is only\nthere to lighten the way to the object of its desires. A man is great or\nsmall according to the predominance of one or the other of these views\nof life.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt is quite certain that many a man owes his life's happiness solely to\nthe circumstance that he possesses a pleasant smile, and so wins the\nhearts of others. However, these hearts would do better to take care to\nremember what Hamlet put down in his tablets--_that one may smile, and\nsmile, and be a villain_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nPeople of great and brilliant capacities think little of admitting or\nexposing their faults and weaknesses. They regard them as something for\nwhich they have paid, and even are of the opinion that these weaknesses,\ninstead of being a disgrace to them, do them honour. This is especially\nthe case when they are errors that are inseparable from their brilliant\ncapacities--_conditiones sine quibus non_, or, as George Sand expressed\nit, _chacun a les d\u00e9fauts de ses vertus_.\nOn the contrary, there are people of good character and irreproachable\nminds, who, rather than admit their few little weaknesses, carefully\nconceal them, and are very sensitive if any reference is made to them;\nand this just because their whole merit consists in the absence of\nerrors and defects; and hence when these errors come to light they are\nimmediately held in less esteem.\n*       *       *       *       *\nModesty, in people of moderate ability, is merely honesty, but in people\nof great talent it is hypocrisy. Hence it is just as becoming in the\nlatter to openly admit the regard they have for themselves, and not to\nconceal the fact that they are conscious of possessing exceptional\ncapabilities, as it is in the former to be modest. Valerius Maximus\ngives some very good examples of this in his chapter _de fiducia sui_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMan even surpasses all the lower order of animals in his capacity for\nbeing trained. Mohammedans are trained to pray five times a day with\ntheir faces turned towards Mecca; and they do it regularly. Christians\nare trained to make the sign of the Cross on certain occasions, and to\nbow, and so forth; so that religion on the whole is a real masterpiece\nof training--that is to say, it trains people what they are to think;\nand the training, as is well known, cannot begin too early. There is no\nabsurdity, however palpable it may be, which may not be fixed in the\nminds of all men, if it is inculcated before they are six years old by\ncontinual and earnest repetition. For it is the same with men as with\nanimals, to train them with perfect success one must begin when they are\nvery young.\nNoblemen are trained to regard nothing more sacred than their word of\nhonour, to believe earnestly, rigidly, and firmly in the inane code of\nknight-errantry, and if necessary to seal their belief by death, and to\nlook upon a king as a being of a higher order. Politeness and\ncompliments, and particularly our courteous attitude towards ladies, are\nthe result of training; and so is our esteem for birth, position, and\ntitle. And so is our displeasure at certain expressions directed against\nus, our displeasure being proportionate to the expression used. The\nEnglishman has been trained to consider his being called no gentleman a\ncrime worthy of death--a liar, a still greater crime; and so, the\nFrenchman, if he is called a coward; a German, if he is called a stupid.\nMany people are trained to be honest in some particular direction,\nwhilst in everything else they exhibit very little honesty; so that many\na man will not steal money, but he will steal everything that will\nafford him enjoyment in an indirect way. Many a shopkeeper will deceive\nwithout scruple, but he will on no condition whatever steal.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe doctor sees mankind in all its weakness; the lawyer in all its\nwickedness; the theologian in all its stupidity.\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Opinion_ obeys the same law as the swing of the pendulum: if it goes\nbeyond the centre of gravity on one side, it must go as far beyond on\nthe other. It is only after a time that it finds the true point of rest\nand remains stationary.\n*       *       *       *       *\nDistance in space decreases the size of things, for it contracts them\nand so makes their defects and deficiencies disappear. This is why\neverything looks so much finer in a contracting mirror or in a _camera\nobscura_ than it is in reality; and the past is affected in the same way\nin the course of time. The scenes and events that happened long ago, as\nwell as the persons who took part in them, become a delight to the\nmemory, which ignores everything that is immaterial and disagreeable.\nThe present possesses no such advantage; it always seems to be\ndefective. And in space, small objects near at hand appear to be big,\nand if they are very near, they cover the whole of our field of vision;\nbut as soon as we stand some little distance away they become minute and\nfinally invisible. And so it is with time: the little affairs and\nmisfortunes of everyday life excite in us emotion, anxiety, vexation,\npassion, for so long as they are quite near us, they appear big,\nimportant, and considerable; but as soon as the inexhaustible stream of\ntime has carried them into the distance they become unimportant; they\nare not worth remembering and are soon forgotten, because their\nimportance merely consisted in being near.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt is only now and then that a man learns something; but he forgets the\nwhole day long.\nOur memory is like a sieve, that with time and use holds less and less;\nin so far, namely, as the older we get, the quicker anything we have\nentrusted to our memory slips through it, while anything that was fixed\nfirmly in it, when we were young, remains. This is why an old man's\nrecollections are the clearer the further they go back, and the less\nclear the nearer they approach the present; so that his memory, like his\neyes, becomes long-sighted (\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03c5\u03c2).\nThat sometimes, and apparently without any reason, long-forgotten scenes\nsuddenly come into the memory, is, in many cases, due to the recurrence\nof a scarcely perceptible odour, of which we were conscious when those\nscenes actually took place; for it is well known that odours more easily\nthan anything else awaken memories, and that, in general, something of\nan extremely trifling nature is all that is necessary to call up a\n_nexus idearum_.\nAnd by the way, I may say that the sense of sight has to do with the\nunderstanding,[15] the sense of hearing with reason,[16] and the sense\nof smell with memory, as we see in the present case. Touch and taste are\nsomething real, and dependent on contact; they have no ideal side.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMemory has also this peculiarity attached to it, that a slight state of\nintoxication very often enhances the remembrance of past times and\nscenes, whereby all the circumstances connected with them are recalled\nmore distinctly than they could be in a state of sobriety; on the other\nhand, the recollection of what one said or did while in a state of\nintoxication is less clear than usual, nay, one does not recollect at\nall if one has been very drunk. Therefore, intoxication enhances one's\nrecollection of the past, while, on the other hand, one remembers little\nof the present, while in that state.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThat arithmetic is the basest of all mental activities is proved by the\nfact that it is the only one that can be accomplished by means of a\nmachine. Take, for instance, the reckoning machines that are so commonly\nused in England at the present time, and solely for the sake of\nconvenience. But all _analysis finitorum et infinitorum_ is\nfundamentally based on calculation. Therefore we may gauge the \"profound\nsense of the mathematician,\" of whom Lichtenberg has made fun, in that\nhe says: \"These so-called professors of mathematics have taken advantage\nof the ingenuousness of other people, have attained the credit of\npossessing profound sense, which strongly resembles the theologians'\nprofound sense of their own holiness.\"\n*       *       *       *       *\nAs a rule, people of very great capacities will get on better with a man\nof extremely limited intelligence than with a man of ordinary\nintelligence; and it is for the same reason that the despot and the\nplebeians, the grandparents and the grandchildren, are natural allies.\n*       *       *       *       *\nI am not surprised that people are bored when they are alone; they\ncannot laugh when they are alone, for such a thing seems foolish to\nthem. Is laughter, then, to be regarded as merely a signal for others, a\nmere sign, like a word? It is a want of imagination and dulness of mind\ngenerally (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2), as Theophrastus puts it, that\nprevents people from laughing when they are alone. The lower animals\nneither laugh when they are alone nor in company.\nNyson, the misanthropist, was surprised as he was laughing to himself by\none of these people, who asked him why he laughed when he was alone.\n\"That is just why I was laughing,\" was the answer.\n*       *       *       *       *\nPeople who do not go to the theatre are like those who make their toilet\nwithout a looking-glass;--but it is still worse to come to a decision\nwithout seeking the advice of a friend. For a man may have the most\ncorrect and excellent judgment in everything else but in his own\naffairs; because here the will at once deranges the intellect. Therefore\na man should seek counsel. A doctor can cure every one but himself; this\nis why he calls in a colleague when he is ill.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe natural gesticulation of everyday life, such as accompanies any kind\nof lively conversation, is a language of its own, and, moreover, is much\nmore universal than the language of words; so far as it is independent\nof words, and the same in all nations; although each nation makes use of\ngesticulation in proportion to its vivacity, and in individual nations,\nthe Italian, for instance, it is supplemented by some few gesticulations\nwhich are merely conventional, and have therefore only local value.\nIts universal use is analogous to logic and grammar, since it expresses\nthe form and not the matter of conversation. However, it is to be\ndistinguished from them since it has not only an intellectual relation\nbut also a moral--that is, it defines the movements of the will. And so\nit accompanies conversation, just as a correctly progressive bass\naccompanies a melody, and serves in the same way to enhance the effect.\nThe most interesting fact about gesticulation is that as soon as\nconversation assumes the same _form_ there is a repetition of the same\ngesture. This is the case, however varied the _matter_, that is to say,\nthe subject-matter, may be. So that I am able to understand quite well\nthe general nature of a conversation--in other words, the mere form and\ntype of it, while looking out of a window--without hearing a word\nspoken. It is unmistakably evident that the speaker is arguing,\nadvancing his reasons, then modifying them, then urging them, and\ndrawing his conclusion in triumph; or it may be he is relating some\nwrong that he has suffered, plainly depicting in strong and condemnatory\nlanguage the stupidity and stubbornness of his opponents; or he is\nspeaking of the splendid plan he has thought out and put in execution,\nexplaining how it became a success, or perhaps failed because fate was\nunfavourable; or perhaps he is confessing that he was powerless to act\nin the matter in question; or recounting that he noticed and saw\nthrough, in good time, the evil schemes that had been organised against\nhim, and by asserting his rights or using force frustrated them and\npunished their author; and a hundred other things of a similar kind. But\nwhat gesticulation alone really conveys to me is the essential\nmatter--be it of a moral or intellectual nature--of the whole\nconversation _in abstracto_. That is to say the quintessence, the true\nsubstance of the conversation, remains identical whatever has brought\nabout the conversation, and consequently whatever the subject-matter of\nit may be.\nThe most interesting and amusing part of the matter, as has been said,\nis the complete identity of the gestures for denoting the same kind of\ncircumstances, even if they are used by most diverse people; just as the\nwords of a language are alike for every one and liable to such\nmodifications as are brought about by a slight difference in accent or\neducation. And yet these standing forms of gesticulation which are\nuniversally observed are certainly the outcome of no convention; they\nare natural and original, a true language of nature, which may have been\nstrengthened by imitation and custom. It is incumbent on an actor, as is\nwell known, and on a public speaker, to a less extent, to make a careful\nstudy of gesture--a study which must principally consist in the\nobservation and imitation of others, for the matter cannot very well be\nbased on abstract rules; with the exception of some quite general\nleading principles--as, for instance, that the gesture must not follow\nthe word, but rather immediately precede it, in order to announce it and\nthereby rouse attention.\nThe English have a peculiar contempt for gesticulation, and regard it as\nsomething undignified and common; this seems to me to be only one of\nthose silly prejudices of English fastidiousness. For it is a language\nwhich nature has given to every one and which every one understands;\ntherefore to abolish and forbid it for no other reason than to gratify\nthat so much extolled, gentlemanly feeling, is a very dubious thing to\ndo.\n*       *       *       *       *\nThe state of human happiness, for the most part, is like certain groups\nof trees, which seen from a distance look wonderfully fine; but if we go\nup to them and among them, their beauty disappears; we do not know\nwherein it lay, for it is only trees that surround us. And so it happens\nthat we often envy the position of others.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[14] _Grundpr. der Ethik_, p. 48; _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_, vol.\ni. p. 338.\n[15] _Vierfache Wurzel_, \u00a7 21.\n[16] _Pererga_, vol. ii. \u00a7 311.\nMETAPHYSICS OF LOVE.\nWe are accustomed to see poets principally occupied with describing the\nlove of the sexes. This, as a rule, is the leading idea of every\ndramatic work, be it tragic or comic, romantic or classic, Indian or\nEuropean. It in no less degree constitutes the greater part of both\nlyric and epic poetry, especially if in these we include the host of\nromances which have been produced every year for centuries in every\ncivilised country in Europe as regularly as the fruits of the earth. All\nthese works are nothing more than many-sided, short, or long\ndescriptions of the passion in question. Moreover, the most successful\ndelineations of love, such, for example, as _Romeo and Juliet, La\nNouvelle H\u00e9loise_, and _Werther_, have attained immortal fame.\nRochefoucauld says that love may be compared to a ghost since it is\nsomething we talk about but have never seen, and Lichtenberg, in his\nessay _Ueber die Macht der Liebe_, disputes and denies its reality and\nnaturalness--but both are in the wrong. For if it were foreign to and\ncontradicted human nature--in other words, if it were merely an\nimaginary caricature, it would not have been depicted with such zeal by\nthe poets of all ages, or accepted by mankind with an unaltered\ninterest; for anything artistically beautiful cannot exist without\ntruth.\n\"_Rien n'est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable_.\"--BOIL.\nExperience, although not that of everyday, verifies that that which as a\nrule begins only as a strong and yet controllable inclination, may\ndevelop, under certain conditions, into a passion, the ardour of which\nsurpasses that of every other. It will ignore all considerations,\novercome all kinds of obstacles with incredible strength and\npersistence. A man, in order to have his love gratified, will\nunhesitatingly risk his life; in fact, if his love is absolutely\nrejected, he will sacrifice his life into the bargain. The Werthers and\nJacopo Ortis do not only exist in romances; Europe produces every year\nat least half-a-dozen like them: _sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi_:\nfor their sufferings are chronicled by the writer of official registers\nor by the reporters of newspapers. Indeed, readers of the police news in\nEnglish and French newspapers will confirm what I have said.\nLove drives a still greater number of people into the lunatic asylum.\nThere is a case of some sort every year of two lovers committing suicide\ntogether because material circumstances happen to be unfavourable to\ntheir union. By the way, I cannot understand how it is that such people,\nwho are confident of each other's love, and expect to find their\ngreatest happiness in the enjoyment of it, do not avoid taking extreme\nsteps, and prefer suffering every discomfort to sacrificing with their\nlives a happiness which is greater than any other they can conceive. As\nfar as lesser phases and passages of love are concerned, all of us have\nthem daily before our eyes, and, if we are not old, the most of us in\nour hearts.\nAfter what has been brought to mind, one cannot doubt either the reality\nor importance of love. Instead, therefore, of wondering why a\nphilosopher for once in a way writes on this subject, which has been\nconstantly the theme of poets, rather should one be surprised that love,\nwhich always plays such an important _r\u00f4le_ in a man's life, has\nscarcely ever been considered at all by philosophers, and that it still\nstands as material for them to make use of.\nPlato has devoted himself more than any one else to the subject of love,\nespecially in the _Symposium_ and the _Phaedrus_; what he has said about\nit, however, comes within the sphere of myth, fable, and raillery, and\nonly applies for the most part to the love of a Greek youth. The little\nthat Rousseau says in his _Discours sur l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9_ is neither true nor\nsatisfactory. Kant's disquisition on love in the third part of his\ntreatise, _Ueber das Gef\u00fchl des Sch\u00f6nen und Erhabenen_, is very\nsuperficial; it shows that he has not thoroughly gone into the subject,\nand therefore it is somewhat untrue. Finally, Platner's treatment of it\nin his _Anthropology_ will be found by every one to be insipid and\nshallow.\nTo amuse the reader, on the other hand, Spinoza's definition deserves to\nbe quoted because of its exuberant na\u00efvet\u00e9: _Amor est titillatio,\nconcomitante idea causae externae_ (_Eth._ iv., prop. 44). It is not my\nintention to be either influenced or to contradict what has been written\nby my predecessors; the subject has forced itself upon me objectively,\nand has of itself become inseparable from my consideration of the world.\nMoreover, I shall expect least approval from those people who are for\nthe moment enchained by this passion, and in consequence try to express\ntheir exuberant feelings in the most sublime and ethereal images. My\nview will seem to them too physical, too material, however metaphysical,\nnay, transcendent it is fundamentally.\nFirst of all let them take into consideration that the creature whom\nthey are idealising to-day in madrigals and sonnets would have been\nignored almost entirely by them if she had been born eighteen years\npreviously.\nEvery kind of love, however ethereal it may seem to be, springs entirely\nfrom the instinct of sex; indeed, it is absolutely this instinct, only\nin a more definite, specialised, and perhaps, strictly speaking, more\nindividualised form. If, bearing this in mind, one considers the\nimportant _r\u00f4le_ which love plays in all its phases and degrees, not\nonly in dramas and novels, but also in the real world, where next to\none's love of life it shows itself as the strongest and most active of\nall motives; if one considers that it constantly occupies half the\ncapacities and thoughts of the younger part of humanity, and is the\nfinal goal of almost every human effort; that it influences adversely\nthe most important affairs; that it hourly disturbs the most earnest\noccupations; that it sometimes deranges even the greatest intellects for\na time; that it is not afraid of interrupting the transactions of\nstatesmen or the investigations of men of learning; that it knows how to\nleave its love-letters and locks of hair in ministerial portfolios and\nphilosophical manuscripts; that it knows equally well how to plan the\nmost complicated and wicked affairs, to dissolve the most important\nrelations, to break the strongest ties; that life, health, riches, rank,\nand happiness are sometimes sacrificed for its sake; that it makes the\notherwise honest, perfidious, and a man who has been hitherto faithful a\nbetrayer, and, altogether, appears as a hostile demon whose object is to\noverthrow, confuse, and upset everything it comes across: if all this is\ntaken into consideration one will have reason to ask--\"Why is there all\nthis noise? Why all this crowding, blustering, anguish, and want? Why\nshould such a trifle play so important a part and create disturbance and\nconfusion in the well-regulated life of mankind?\" But to the earnest\ninvestigator the spirit of truth gradually unfolds the answer: it is not\na trifle one is dealing with; the importance of love is absolutely in\nkeeping with the seriousness and zeal with which it is prosecuted. The\nultimate aim of all love-affairs, whether they be of a tragic or comic\nnature, is really more important than all other aims in human life, and\ntherefore is perfectly deserving of that profound seriousness with which\nit is pursued.\nAs a matter of fact, love determines nothing less than the\n_establishment of the next generation_. The existence and nature of the\n_dramatis personae_ who come on to the scene when we have made our exit\nhave been determined by some frivolous love-affair. As the being, the\n_existentia_ of these future people is conditioned by our instinct of\nsex in general, so is the nature, the _essentia_, of these same people\nconditioned by the selection that the individual makes for his\nsatisfaction, that is to say, by love, and is thereby in every respect\nirrevocably established. This is the key of the problem. In applying it,\nwe shall understand it more fully if we analyse the various degrees of\nlove, from the most fleeting sensation to the most ardent passion; we\nshall then see that the difference arises from the degree of\nindividualisation of the choice. All the love-affairs of the present\ngeneration taken altogether are accordingly the _meditatio compositionis\ngenerationis futurae, e qua iterum pendent innumerae generationes_ of\nmankind. Love is of such high import, because it has nothing to do with\nthe weal or woe of the present individual, as every other matter has; it\nhas to secure the existence and special nature of the human race in\nfuture times; hence the will of the individual appears in a higher\naspect as the will of the species; and this it is that gives a pathetic\nand sublime import to love-affairs, and makes their raptures and\ntroubles transcendent, emotions which poets for centuries have not tired\nof depicting in a variety of ways. There is no subject that can rouse\nthe same interest as love, since it concerns both the weal and woe of\nthe species, and is related to every other which only concerns the\nwelfare of the individual as body to surface.\nThis is why it is so difficult to make a drama interesting if it\npossesses no love motive; on the other hand, the subject is never\nexhausted, although it is constantly being utilised.\nWhat manifests itself in the individual consciousness as instinct of sex\nin general, without being concentrated on any particular individual, is\nvery plainly in itself, in its generalised form, the will to live. On\nthe other hand, that which appears as instinct of sex directed to a\ncertain individual, is in itself the will to live as a definitely\ndetermined individual. In this case the instinct of sex very cleverly\nwears the mask of objective admiration, although in itself it is a\nsubjective necessity, and is, thereby, deceptive. Nature needs these\nstratagems in order to accomplish her ends. The purpose of every man in\nlove, however objective and sublime his admiration may appear to be, is\nto beget a being of a definite nature, and that this is so, is verified\nby the fact that it is not mutual love but possession that is the\nessential. Without possession it is no consolation to a man to know that\nhis love is requited. In fact, many a man has shot himself on finding\nhimself in such a position. On the other hand, take a man who is very\nmuch in love; if he cannot have his love returned he is content simply\nwith possession. Compulsory marriages and cases of seduction corroborate\nthis, for a man whose love is not returned frequently finds consolation\nin giving handsome presents to a woman, in spite of her dislike, or\nmaking other sacrifices, so that he may buy her favour.\nThe real aim of the whole of love's romance, although the persons\nconcerned are unconscious of the fact, is that a particular being may\ncome into the world; and the way and manner in which it is accomplished\nis a secondary consideration. However much those of lofty sentiments,\nand especially of those in love, may refute the gross realism of my\nargument, they are nevertheless in the wrong. For is not the aim of\ndefinitely determining the individualities of the next generation a much\nhigher and nobler aim than that other, with its exuberant sensations and\ntranscendental soap-bubbles? Among all earthly aims is there one that is\neither more important or greater? It alone is in keeping with that\ndeep-rooted feeling inseparable from passionate love, with that\nearnestness with which it appears, and the importance which it attaches\nto the trifles that come within its sphere. It is only in so far as we\nregard _this_ end as the real one that the difficulties encountered, the\nendless troubles and vexations endured, in order to attain the object we\nlove, appear to be in keeping with the matter. For it is the future\ngeneration in its entire individual determination which forces itself\ninto existence through the medium of all this strife and trouble.\nIndeed, the future generation itself is already stirring in the careful,\ndefinite, and apparently capricious selection for the satisfaction of\nthe instinct of sex which we call love. That growing affection of two\nlovers for each other is in reality the will to live of the new being,\nof which they shall become the parents; indeed, in the meeting of their\nyearning glances the life of a new being is kindled, and manifests\nitself as a well-organised individuality of the future. The lovers have\na longing to be really united and made one being, and to live as such\nfor the rest of their lives; and this longing is fulfilled in the\nchildren born to them, in whom the qualities inherited from both, but\ncombined and united in one being, are perpetuated. Contrarily, if a man\nand woman mutually, persistently, and decidedly dislike each other, it\nindicates that they could only bring into the world a badly organised,\ndiscordant, and unhappy being. Therefore much must be attached to\nCalderon's words, when he calls the horrible Semiramis a daughter of the\nair, yet introduces her as a daughter of seduction, after which follows\nthe murder of the husband.\nFinally, it is the will to live presenting itself in the whole species,\nwhich so forcibly and exclusively attracts two individuals of different\nsex towards each other. This will anticipates in the being, of which\nthey shall become the parents, an objectivation of its nature\ncorresponding to its aims. This individual will inherit the father's\nwill and character, the mother's intellect, and the constitution of\nboth. As a rule, however, an individual takes more after the father in\nshape and the mother in stature, corresponding to the law which applies\nto the offspring of animals.... It is impossible to explain the\nindividuality of each man, which is quite exceptional and peculiar to\nhim alone; and it is just as impossible to explain the passion of two\npeople for each other, for it is equally individual and uncommon in\ncharacter; indeed, fundamentally both are one and the same. The former\nis _explicite_ what the latter was _implicite_.\nWe must consider as the origin of a new individual and true _punctum\nsaliens_ of its life the moment when the parents begin to love each\nother--_to fancy each other_, as the English appropriately express it.\nAnd, as has been said, in the meeting of their longing glances\noriginates the first germ of a new being, which, indeed, like all germs,\nis generally crushed out. This new individual is to a certain extent a\nnew (Platonic) Idea; now, as all Ideas strive with the greatest\nvehemence to enter the phenomenal sphere, and to do this, ardently seize\nupon the matter which the law of causality distributes among them all,\nso this particular Idea of a human individuality struggles with the\ngreatest eagerness and vehemence for its realisation in the phenomenal.\nIt is precisely this vehement desire which is the passion of the future\nparents for one another. Love has countless degrees, and its two\nextremes may be indicated as \u1f08\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1;\nnevertheless, in essentials it is the same everywhere.\nAccording to the degree, on the other hand, it will be the more powerful\nthe more _individualised_ it is--that is to say, the more the loved\nindividual, by virtue of all her qualities, is exclusively fit to\nsatisfy the lover's desire and needs determined by her own\nindividuality. If we investigate further we shall understand more\nclearly what this involves. All amorous feeling immediately and\nessentially concentrates itself on health, strength, and beauty, and\nconsequently on youth; because the will above all wishes to exhibit the\nspecific character of the human species as the basis of all\nindividuality. The same applies pretty well to everyday courtship\n(\u1f08\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2). With this are bound up more special requirements,\nwhich we will consider individually later on, and with which, if there\nis any prospect of gratification, there is an increase of passion.\nIntense love, however, springs from a fitness of both individualities\nfor each other; so that the will, that is to say the father's character\nand the mother's intellect combined, exactly complete that individual\nfor which the will to live in general (which exhibits itself in the\nwhole species) has a longing--a longing proportionate to this its\ngreatness, and therefore surpassing the measure of a mortal heart; its\nmotives being in a like manner beyond the sphere of the individual\nintellect. This, then, is the soul of a really great passion. The more\nperfectly two individuals are fitted for each other in the various\nrespects which we shall consider further on, the stronger will be their\npassion for each other. As there are not two individuals exactly alike,\na particular kind of woman must perfectly correspond with a particular\nkind of man--always in view of the child that is to be born. Real,\npassionate love is as rare as the meeting of two people exactly fitted\nfor each other. By the way, it is because there is a possibility of real\npassionate love in us all that we understand why poets have depicted it\nin their works.\nBecause the kernel of passionate love turns on the anticipation of the\nchild to be born and its nature, it is quite possible for friendship,\nwithout any admixture of sexual love, to exist between two young,\ngood-looking people of different sex, if there is perfect fitness of\ntemperament and intellectual capacity. In fact, a certain aversion for\neach other may exist also. The reason of this is that a child begotten\nby them would physically or mentally have discordant qualities. In\nshort, the child's existence and nature would not be in harmony with the\npurposes of the will to live as it presents itself in the species.\nIn an opposite case, where there is no fitness of disposition,\ncharacter, and mental capacity, whereby aversion, nay, even enmity for\neach other exists, it is possible for love to spring up. Love of this\nkind makes them blind to everything; and if it leads to marriage it is a\nvery unhappy one.\nAnd now let us more thoroughly investigate the matter. Egoism is a\nquality so deeply rooted in every personality that it is on egotistical\nends only that one may safely rely in order to rouse the individual to\nactivity.\nTo be sure, the species has a prior, nearer, and greater claim on the\nindividual than the transient individuality itself; and yet even when\nthe individual makes some sort of conscious sacrifice for the\nperpetuation and future of the species, the importance of the matter\nwill not be made sufficiently comprehensible to his intellect, which is\nmainly constituted to regard individual ends.\nTherefore Nature attains her ends by implanting in the individual a\ncertain illusion by which something which is in reality advantageous to\nthe species alone seems to be advantageous to himself; consequently he\nserves the latter while he imagines he is serving himself. In this\nprocess he is carried away by a mere chimera, which floats before him\nand vanishes again immediately, and as a motive takes the place of\nreality. _This illusion is instinct_. In most instances instinct may be\nregarded as the sense of the species which presents to the will whatever\nis of service to the species. But because the will has here become\nindividual it must be deceived in such a manner for it to discern by the\nsense of the _individual_ what the sense of the species has presented to\nit; in other words, imagine it is pursuing ends concerning the\nindividual, when in reality it is pursuing merely general ends (using\nthe word general in its strictest sense).\nOutward manifestation of instinct can be best observed in animals, where\nthe part it plays is most significant; but it is in ourselves alone that\nwe can get to know its internal process, as of everything internal. It\nis true, it is thought that man has scarcely any instinct at all, or at\nany rate has only sufficient instinct when he is born to seek and take\nhis mother's breast. But as a matter of fact man has a very decided,\nclear, and yet complicated instinct--namely, for the selection, both\nearnest and capricious, of another individual, to satisfy his instinct\nof sex. The beauty or ugliness of the other individual has nothing\nwhatever to do with this satisfaction in itself, that is in so far as it\nis a matter of pleasure based upon a pressing desire of the individual.\nThe regard, however, for this satisfaction, which is so zealously\npursued, as well as the careful selection it entails, has obviously\nnothing to do with the chooser himself, although he fancies that it has.\nIts real aim is the child to be born, in whom the type of the species is\nto be preserved in as pure and perfect a form as possible. For instance,\ndifferent phases of degeneration of the human form are the consequences\nof a thousand physical accidents and moral delinquencies; and yet the\ngenuine type of the human form is, in all its parts, always restored;\nfurther, this is accomplished under the guidance of the sense of beauty,\nwhich universally directs the instinct of sex, and without which the\nsatisfaction of the latter would deteriorate to a repulsive necessity.\nAccordingly, every one in the first place will infinitely prefer and\nardently desire those who are most beautiful--in other words, those in\nwhom the character of the species is most purely defined; and in the\nsecond, every one will desire in the other individual those perfections\nwhich he himself lacks, and he will consider imperfections, which are\nthe reverse of his own, beautiful. This is why little men prefer big\nwomen, and fair people like dark, and so on. The ecstasy with which a\nman is filled at the sight of a beautiful woman, making him imagine that\nunion with her will be the greatest happiness, is simply the _sense of\nthe species_. The preservation of the type of the species rests on this\ndistinct preference for beauty, and this is why beauty has such power.\nWe will later on more fully state the considerations which this\ninvolves. It is really instinct aiming at what is best in the species\nwhich induces a man to choose a beautiful woman, although the man\nhimself imagines that by so doing he is only seeking to increase his own\npleasure. As a matter of fact, we have here an instructive solution of\nthe secret nature of all instinct which almost always, as in this case,\nprompts the individual to look after the welfare of the species. The\ncare with which an insect selects a certain flower or fruit, or piece of\nflesh, or the way in which the ichneumon seeks the larva of a strange\ninsect so that it may lay its eggs in _that particular place only_, and\nto secure which it fears neither labour nor danger, is obviously very\nanalogous to the care with which a man chooses a woman of a definite\nnature individually suited to him. He strives for her with such ardour\nthat he frequently, in order to attain his object, will sacrifice his\nhappiness in life, in spite of all reason, by a foolish marriage, by\nsome love-affair which costs him his fortune, honour, and life, even by\ncommitting crimes. And all this in accordance with the will of nature\nwhich is everywhere sovereign, so that he may serve the species in the\nmost efficient manner, although he does so at the expense of the\nindividual.\nInstinct everywhere works as with the conception of an end, and yet it\nis entirely without one. Nature implants instinct where the acting\nindividual is not capable of understanding the end, or would be\nunwilling to pursue it. Consequently, as a rule, it is only given\nprominently to animals, and in particular to those of the lowest order,\nwhich have the least intelligence. But it is only in such a case as the\none we are at present considering that it is also given to man, who\nnaturally is capable of understanding the end, but would not pursue it\nwith the necessary zeal--that is to say, he would not pursue it at the\ncost of his individual welfare. So that here, as in all cases of\ninstinct, truth takes the form of illusion in order to influence the\nwill....\nAll this, however, on its part throws light upon the instinct of\nanimals. They, too, are undoubtedly carried away by a kind of illusion,\nwhich represents that they are working for their own pleasure, while it\nis for the species that they are working with such industry and\nself-denial. The bird builds its nest; the insect seeks a suitable place\nwherein to lay its eggs, or even hunts for prey, which it dislikes\nitself, but which must be placed beside the eggs as food for the future\nlarvae; the bee, the wasp, and the ant apply themselves to their skilful\nbuilding and extremely complex economy. All of them are undoubtedly\ncontrolled by an illusion which conceals the service of the species\nunder the mask of an egotistical purpose.\nThis is probably the only way in which to make the inner or subjective\nprocess, from which spring all manifestations of instinct, intelligible\nto us. The outer or objective process, however, shows in animals\nstrongly controlled by instinct, as insects for instance, a\npreponderance of the ganglion--_i.e., subjective_ nervous system over\nthe _objective_ or cerebral system. From which it may be concluded that\nthey are controlled not so much by objective and proper apprehension as\nby subjective ideas, which excite desire and arise through the influence\nof the ganglionic system upon the brain; accordingly they are moved by a\ncertain illusion....\nThe great preponderance of brain in man accounts for his having fewer\ninstincts than the lower order of animals, and for even these few easily\nbeing led astray. For instance, the sense of beauty which instinctively\nguides a man in his selection of a mate is misguided when it degenerates\ninto the proneness to pederasty. Similarly, the blue-bottle (_Musca\nvomitoria_), which instinctively ought to place its eggs in putrified\nflesh, lays them in the blossom of the _Arum dracunculus_, because it is\nmisled by the decaying odour of this plant. That an absolutely generic\ninstinct is the foundation of all love of sex may be confirmed by a\ncloser analysis of the subject--an analysis which can hardly be avoided.\nIn the first place, a man in love is by nature inclined to be\ninconstant, while a woman constant. A man's love perceptibly decreases\nafter a certain period; almost every other woman charms him more than\nthe one he already possesses; he longs for change: while a woman's love\nincreases from the very moment it is returned. This is because nature\naims at the preservation of the species, and consequently at as great an\nincrease in it as possible.... This is why a man is always desiring\nother women, while a woman always clings to one man; for nature compels\nher intuitively and unconsciously to take care of the supporter and\nprotector of the future offspring. For this reason conjugal fidelity is\nartificial with the man but natural to a woman. Hence a woman's\ninfidelity, looked at objectively on account of the consequences, and\nsubjectively on account of its unnaturalness, is much more unpardonable\nthan a man's.\nIn order to be quite clear and perfectly convinced that the delight we\ntake in the other sex, however objective it may seem to be, is\nnevertheless merely instinct disguised, in other words, the sense of the\nspecies striving to preserve its type, it will be necessary to\ninvestigate more closely the considerations which influence us in this,\nand go into details, strange as it may seem for these details to figure\nin a philosophical work. These considerations may be classed in the\nfollowing way:--\nThose that immediately concern the type of the species, _id est_,\nbeauty; those that concern other physical qualities; and finally, those\nthat are merely relative and spring from the necessary correction or\nneutralisation of the one-sided qualities and abnormities of the two\nindividuals by each other. Let us look at these considerations\nseparately.\nThe first consideration that influences our choice and feelings is\n_age_....\nThe second consideration is that of _health_: a severe illness may alarm\nus for the time being, but an illness of a chronic nature or even\ncachexy frightens us away, because it would be transmitted.\nThe third consideration is the _skeleton_, since it is the foundation of\nthe type of the _species_. Next to old age and disease, nothing disgusts\nus so much as a deformed shape; even the most beautiful face cannot make\namends for it--in fact, the ugliest face combined with a well-grown\nshape is infinitely preferable. Moreover, we are most keenly sensible of\nevery malformation of the _skeleton_; as, for instance, a stunted,\nshort-legged form, and the like, or a limping gait when it is not the\nresult of some extraneous accident: while a conspicuously beautiful\nfigure compensates for every defect. It delights us. Further, the great\nimportance which is attached to small feet! This is because the size of\nthe foot is an essential characteristic of the species, for no animal\nhas the tarsus and metatarsus combined so small as man; hence the\nuprightness of his gait: he is a plantigrade. And Jesus Sirach has\nsaid[17] (according to the improved translation by Kraus), \"A woman that\nis well grown and has beautiful feet is like pillars of gold in sockets\nof silver.\" The teeth, too, are important, because they are essential\nfor nourishment, and quite peculiarly hereditary.\nThe fourth consideration is a certain _plumpness_, in other words, a\nsuperabundance of the vegetative function, plasticity.... Hence\nexcessive thinness strikingly repels us.... The last consideration that\ninfluences us is a _beautiful face_. Here, too, the bone parts are taken\ninto account before everything else. So that almost everything depends\non a beautiful nose, while a short _retrouss\u00e9_ one will mar all. A\nslight upward or downward turn of the nose has often determined the\nlife's happiness of a great many maidens; and justly so, for the type of\nthe species is at stake.\nA small mouth, by means of small maxillae, is very essential, as it is\nthe specific characteristic of the human face as distinguished from the\nmuzzle of the brutes. A receding, as it were, a cut-away chin is\nparticularly repellent, because _mentum prominulum_ is a characteristic\nbelonging exclusively to our species.\nFinally, we come to the consideration of beautiful eyes and a beautiful\nforehead; they depend upon the psychical qualities, and in particular,\nthe intellectual, which are inherited from the mother. The unconscious\nconsiderations which, on the other hand, influence women in their choice\nnaturally cannot be so accurately specified. In general, we may say the\nfollowing:--That the age they prefer is from thirty to thirty-five. For\ninstance, they prefer men of this age to youths, who in reality possess\nthe highest form of human beauty. The reason for this is that they are\nnot guided by taste but by instinct, which recognises in this particular\nage the acme of generative power. In general, women pay little attention\nto beauty, that is, to beauty of face; they seem to take it upon\nthemselves alone to endow the child with beauty. It is chiefly the\nstrength of a man and the courage that goes with it that attract them,\nfor both of these promise the generation of robust children and at the\nsame time a brave protector for them. Every physical defect in a man,\nany deviation from the type, a woman may, with regard to the child,\neradicate if she is faultless in these parts herself or excels in a\ncontrary direction. The only exceptions are those qualities which are\npeculiar to the man, and which, in consequence, a mother cannot bestow\non her child; these include the masculine build of the skeleton, breadth\nof shoulder, small hips, straight legs, strength of muscle, courage,\nbeard, and so on. And so it happens that a woman frequently loves an\nugly man, albeit she never loves an unmanly man, because she cannot\nneutralise his defects.\nThe second class of considerations that are the source of love are those\ndepending on the psychical qualities. Here we shall find that a woman\nuniversally is attracted by the qualities of a man's heart or character,\nboth of which are inherited from the father. It is mainly firmness of\nwill, determination and courage, and may be honesty and goodness of\nheart too, that win a woman over; while intellectual qualifications\nexercise no direct or instinctive power over her, for the simple reason\nthat these are not inherited from the father. A lack of intelligence\ncarries no weight with her; in fact, a superabundance of mental power or\neven genius, as abnormities, might have an unfavourable effect. And so\nwe frequently find a woman preferring a stupid, ugly, and ill-mannered\nman to one who is well-educated, intellectual, and agreeable. Hence,\npeople of extremely different temperament frequently marry for\nlove--that is to say, _he_ is coarse, strong, and narrow-minded, while\n_she_ is very sensitive, refined, cultured, and aesthetic, and so on; or\n_he_ is genial and clever, and _she_ is a goose.\n\"Sic visum Veneri; cui placet impares\nFormas atque animos sub juga a\u00ebnea\nSaevo mittere cum joco.\"\nThe reason for this is, that she is not influenced by intellectual\nconsiderations, but by something entirely different, namely, instinct.\nMarriage is not regarded as a means for intellectual entertainment, but\nfor the generation of children; it is a union of hearts and not of\nminds. When a woman says that she has fallen in love with a man's mind,\nit is either a vain and ridiculous pretence on her part or the\nexaggeration of a degenerate being. A man, on the other hand, is not\ncontrolled in instinctive love by the _qualities_ of the woman's\n_character_; this is why so many a Socrates has found his Xantippe, as\nfor instance, Shakespeare, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Byron, and others. But here\nwe have the influence of intellectual qualities, because they are\ninherited from the mother; nevertheless their influence is easily\noverpowered by physical beauty, which concerns more essential points,\nand therefore has a more direct effect. By the way, it is for this\nreason that mothers who have either felt or experienced the former\ninfluence have their daughters taught the fine arts, languages, etc., so\nthat they may prove more attractive. In this way they hope by artificial\nmeans to pad the intellect, just as they do their bust and hips if it is\nnecessary to do so. Let it be understood that here we are simply\nspeaking of that attraction which is absolutely direct and instinctive,\nand from which springs real love. That an intelligent and educated woman\nesteems intelligence and brains in a man, and that a man after\ndeliberate reasoning criticises and considers the character of his\n_fiance\u00e9_, are matters which do not concern our present subject. Such\nthings influence a rational selection in marriage, but they do not\ncontrol passionate love, which is our matter.\nUp to the present I have taken into consideration merely the _absolute_\nconsiderations--_id est_, such considerations as apply to every one. I\nnow come to the _relative_ considerations, which are individual, because\nthey aim at rectifying the type of the species which is defectively\npresented and at correcting any deviation from it existing in the person\nof the chooser himself, and in this way lead back to a pure presentation\nof the type. Hence each man loves what he himself is deficient in. The\nchoice that is based on relative considerations--that is, has in view\nthe constitution of the individual--is much more certain, decided, and\nexclusive than the choice that is made after merely absolute\nconsiderations; consequently real passionate love will have its origin,\nas a rule, in these relative considerations, and it will only be the\nordinary phases of love that spring from the absolute. So that it is not\nstereotyped, perfectly beautiful women who are wont to kindle great\npassions. Before a truly passionate feeling can exist, something is\nnecessary that is perhaps best expressed by a metaphor in\nchemistry--namely, the two persons must neutralise each other, like acid\nand alkali to a neutral salt. Before this can be done the following\nconditions are essential. In the first place, all sexuality is\none-sided. This one-sidedness is more definitely expressed and exists in\na higher degree in one person than in another; so that it may be better\nsupplemented and neutralised in each individual by one person than by\nanother of the opposite sex, because the individual requires a\none-sidedness opposite to his own in order to complete the type of\nhumanity in the new individual to be generated, to the constitution of\nwhich everything tends....\nThe following is necessary for this neutralisation of which we are\nspeaking. The particular degree of _his_ manhood must exactly correspond\nto the particular degree of _her_ womanhood in order to exactly balance\nthe one-sidedness of each. Hence the most manly man will desire the most\nwomanly woman, and _vice vers\u00e2_, and so each will want the individual\nthat exactly corresponds to him in degree of sex. Inasmuch as two\npersons fulfil this necessary relation towards each other, it is\ninstinctively felt by them and is the origin, together with the other\n_relative_ considerations, of the higher degrees of love. While,\ntherefore, two lovers are pathetically talking about the harmony of\ntheir souls, the kernel of the conversation is for the most part the\nharmony concerning the individual and its perfection, which obviously is\nof much more importance than the harmony of their souls--which\nfrequently turns out to be a violent discord shortly after marriage.\nWe now come to those other relative considerations which depend on each\nindividual trying to eradicate, through the medium of another, his\nweaknesses, deficiencies, and deviations from the type, in order that\nthey may not be perpetuated in the child that is to be born or develop\ninto absolute abnormities. The weaker a man is in muscular power, the\nmore will he desire a woman who is muscular; and the same thing applies\nto a woman....\nNevertheless, if a big woman choose a big husband, in order, perhaps, to\npresent a better appearance in society, the children, as a rule, suffer\nfor her folly. Again, another very decided consideration is complexion.\nBlonde people fancy either absolutely dark complexions or brown; but it\nis rarely the case _vice vers\u00e2_. The reason for it is this: that fair\nhair and blue eyes are a deviation from the type and almost constitute\nan abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at any rate white horses. They\nare not indigenous to any other part of the world but Europe,--not even\nto the polar regions,--and are obviously of Scandinavian origin. _En\npassant_, it is my conviction that a white skin is not natural to man,\nand that by nature he has either a black or brown skin like our\nforefathers, the Hindoos, and that the white man was never originally\ncreated by nature; and that, therefore, there is no _race_ of white\npeople, much as it is talked about, but every white man is a bleached\none. Driven up into the north, where he was a stranger, and where he\nexisted only like an exotic plant, in need of a hothouse in winter, man\nin the course of centuries became white. The gipsies, an Indian tribe\nwhich emigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition of\nthe Hindoo's complexion to ours. In love, therefore, nature strives to\nreturn to dark hair and brown eyes, because they are the original type;\nstill, a white skin has become second nature, although not to such an\nextent as to make the dark skin of the Hindoo repellent to us.\nFinally, every man tries to find the corrective of his own defects and\naberrations in the particular parts of his body, and the more\nconspicuous the defect is the greater is his determination to correct\nit. This is why snub-nosed persons find an aquiline nose or a\nparrot-like face so indescribably pleasing; and the same thing applies\nto every other part of the body. Men of immoderately long and attenuated\nbuild delight in a stunted and short figure. Considerations of\ntemperament also influence a man's choice. Each prefers a temperament\nthe reverse of his own; but only in so far as his is a decided one.\nA man who is quite perfect in some respect himself does not, it is true,\ndesire and love imperfection in this particular respect, yet he can be\nmore easily reconciled to it than another man, because he himself saves\nthe children from being very imperfect in this particular. For instance,\na man who has a very white skin himself will not dislike a yellowish\ncomplexion, while a man who has a yellowish complexion will consider a\ndazzlingly white skin divinely beautiful. It is rare for a man to fall\nin love with a positively ugly woman, but when he does, it is because\nexact harmony in the degree of sex exists between them, and all her\nabnormities are precisely the opposite to, that is to say, the\ncorrective of his. Love in these circumstances is wont to attain a high\ndegree.\nThe profoundly earnest way in which we criticise and narrowly consider\nevery part of a woman, while she on her part considers us; the\nscrupulously careful way we scrutinise, a woman who is beginning to\nplease us; the fickleness of our choice; the strained attention with\nwhich a man watches his _fianc\u00e9e_; the care he takes not to be deceived\nin any trait; and the great importance he attaches to every more or less\nessential trait,--all this is quite in keeping with the importance of\nthe end. For the child that is to be born will have to bear a similar\ntrait through its whole life; for instance, if a woman stoops but a\nlittle, it is possible for her son to be inflicted with a hunchback; and\nso in every other respect. We are not conscious of all this, naturally.\nOn the contrary, each man imagines that his choice is made in the\ninterest of his own pleasure (which, in reality, cannot be interested in\nit at all); his choice, which we must take for granted is in keeping\nwith his own individuality, is made precisely in the interest of the\nspecies, to maintain the type of which as pure as possible is the secret\ntask. In this case the individual unconsciously acts in the interest of\nsomething higher, that is, the species. This is why he attaches so much\nimportance to things to which he might, nay, would be otherwise\nindifferent. There is something quite singular in the unconsciously\nserious and critical way two young people of different sex look at each\nother on meeting for the first time; in the scrutinising and penetrating\nglances they exchange, in the careful inspection which their various\ntraits undergo. This scrutiny and analysis represent the _meditation of\nthe genius of the species_ on the individual which may be born and the\ncombination of its qualities; and the greatness of their delight in and\nlonging for each other is determined by this meditation. This longing,\nalthough it may have become intense, may possibly disappear again if\nsomething previously unobserved comes to light. And so the genius of the\nspecies meditates concerning the coming race in all who are yet not too\nold. It is Cupid's work to fashion this race, and he is always busy,\nalways speculating, always meditating. The affairs of the individual in\ntheir whole ephemeral totality are very trivial compared with those of\nthis divinity, which concern the species and the coming race; therefore\nhe is always ready to sacrifice the individual regardlessly. He is\nrelated to these ephemeral affairs as an immortal being is to a mortal,\nand his interests to theirs as infinite to finite. Conscious, therefore,\nof administering affairs of a higher order than those that concern\nmerely the weal and woe of the individual, he administers them with\nsublime indifference amid the tumult of war, the bustle of business, or\nthe raging of a plague--indeed, he pursues them into the seclusion of\nthe cloisters.\nIt has been seen that the intensity of love grows with its\nindividuation; we have shown that two individuals may be so physically\nconstituted, that, in order to restore the best possible type of the\nspecies, the one is the special and perfect complement of the other,\nwhich, in consequence, exclusively desires it. In a case of this kind,\npassionate love arises, and as it is bestowed on one object, and one\nonly--that is to say, because it appears in the _special_ service of the\nspecies--it immediately assumes a nobler and sublimer nature. On the\nother hand, mere sexual instinct is base, because, without\nindividuation, it is directed to all, and strives to preserve the\nspecies merely as regards quantity with little regard for quality.\nIntense love concentrated on one individual may develop to such a\ndegree, that unless it is gratified all the good things of this world,\nand even life itself, lose their importance. It then becomes a desire,\nthe intensity of which is like none other; consequently it will make any\nkind of sacrifice, and should it happen that it cannot be gratified, it\nmay lead to madness or even suicide. Besides these unconscious\nconsiderations which are the source of passionate love, there must be\nstill others, which we have not so directly before us. Therefore, we\nmust take it for granted that here there is not only a fitness of\nconstitution but also a special fitness between the man's _will_ and the\nwoman's _intellect_, in consequence of which a perfectly definite\nindividual can be born to them alone, whose existence is contemplated by\nthe genius of the species for reasons to us impenetrable, since they are\nthe very essence of the thing-in-itself. Or more strictly speaking, the\nwill to live desires to objectivise itself in an individual which is\nprecisely determined, and can only be begotten by this particular father\nand this particular mother. This metaphysical yearning of the will in\nitself has immediately, as its sphere of action in the circle of human\nbeings, the hearts of the future parents, who accordingly are seized\nwith this desire. They now fancy that it is for their own sakes they are\nlonging for what at present has purely a metaphysical end, that is to\nsay, for what does not come within the range of things that exist in\nreality. In other words, it is the desire of the future individual to\nenter existence, which has first become possible here, a longing which\nproceeds from the primary source of all being and exhibits itself in the\nphenomenal world as the intense love of the future parents for each\nother, and has little regard for anything outside itself. In fact, love\nis an illusion like no other; it will induce a man to sacrifice\neverything he possesses in the world, in order to obtain this woman, who\nin reality will satisfy him no more than any other. It also ceases to\nexist when the end, which was in reality metaphysical, has been\nfrustrated perhaps by the woman's barrenness (which, according to\nHufeland, is the result of nineteen accidental defects in the\nconstitution), just as it is frustrated daily in millions of crushed\ngerms in which the same metaphysical life-principle struggles to exist;\nthere is no other consolation in this than that there is an infinity of\nspace, time, and matter, and consequently inexhaustible opportunity, at\nthe service of the will to live.\nAlthough this subject has not been treated by Theophrastus Paracelsus,\nand my entire train of thought is foreign to him, yet it must have\npresented itself to him, if even in a cursory way, when he gave\nutterance to the following remarkable words, written in quite a\ndifferent context and in his usual desultory style: _Hi sunt, quos Deus\ncopulavit, ut eam, quae fuit Uriae et David; quamvis ex diametro (sic\nenim sibi humana mens persuadebat) cum justo et legitimo matrimonio\npugnaret hoc ... sed propter Salomonem, qui aliunde nasci non potuit,\nnisi ex Bathseba, conjuncto David semine, quamvis meretrice, conjunxit\neos Deus._[18]\nThe yearning of love, the \u1f31\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, which has been expressed in countless\nways and forms by the poets of all ages, without their exhausting the\nsubject or even doing it justice; this longing which makes us imagine\nthat the possession of a certain woman will bring interminable\nhappiness, and the loss of her, unspeakable pain; this longing and this\npain do not arise from the needs of an ephemeral individual, but are, on\nthe contrary, the sigh of the spirit of the species, discerning\nirreparable means of either gaining or losing its ends. It is the\nspecies alone that has an interminable existence: hence it is capable of\nendless desire, endless gratification, and endless pain. These, however,\nare imprisoned in the heart of a mortal; no wonder, therefore, if it\nseems like to burst, and can find no expression for the announcements of\nendless joy or endless pain. This it is that forms the substance of all\nerotic poetry that is sublime in character, which, consequently, soars\ninto transcendent metaphors, surpassing everything earthly. This is the\ntheme of Petrarch, the material for the St. Preuxs, Werthers, and Jacopo\nOrtis, who otherwise could be neither understood nor explained. This\ninfinite regard is not based on any kind of intellectual, nor, in\ngeneral, upon any real merits of the beloved one; because the lover\nfrequently does not know her well enough; as was the case with Petrarch.\nIt is the spirit of the species alone that can see at a glance of what\n_value_ the beloved one is to _it_ for its purposes. Moreover, great\npassions, as a rule, originate at first sight:\n\"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight.\"\n--SHAKESPEARE, _As You Like It,_ iii. 5.\nCuriously enough, there is a passage touching upon this in _Guzmann de\nAlfarache_, a well-known romance written two hundred and fifty years ago\nby Mateo Aleman: _No es necessario para que uno ame, que pase distancia\nde tiempo, que siga discurso, in haga eleccion, sino que con aquella\nprimera y sola vista, concurran juntamente cierta correspondencia \u00f3\nconsonancia, \u00f3 lo que ac\u00e1 solemos vulgarmente decir, una confrontacion\nde sangre, \u00e0 que por particular influxo suelen mover las estrellas_.\n(For a man to love there is no need for any length of time to pass for\nhim to weigh considerations or make his choice, but only that a certain\ncorrespondence and consonance is encountered on both sides at the first\nand only glance, or that which is ordinarily called _a sympathy of\nblood_, to which a peculiar influence of the stars generally impels.)\nAccordingly, the loss of the beloved one through a rival, or through\ndeath, is the greatest pain of all to those passionately in love; just\nbecause it is of a transcendental nature, since it affects him not\nmerely as an individual, but also assails him in his _essentia aeterna_,\nin the life of the species, in whose special will and service he was\nhere called. This is why jealousy is so tormenting and bitter, and the\ngiving up of the loved one the greatest of all sacrifices. A hero is\nashamed of showing any kind of emotion but that which may be the outcome\nof love; the reason for this is, that when he is in love it is not he,\nbut the species which is grieving. In Calderon's _Zenobia the Great_\nthere is a scene in the second act between Zenobia and Decius where the\nlatter says, _Cielos, luego tu me quieres? Perdiera cien mil victorias,\nVolvi\u00e9rame_, etc. (Heavens! then you love me? For this I would\nsacrifice a thousand victories, etc.) In this case honour, which has\nhitherto outweighed every other interest, is driven out of the field\ndirectly love--_i.e._, the interest of the species--comes into play and\ndiscerns something that will be of decided advantage to itself; for the\ninterest of the species, compared with that of the mere individual,\nhowever important this may be, is infinitely more important. Honour,\nduty, and fidelity succumb to it after they have withstood every other\ntemptation--the menace of death even. We find the same going on in\nprivate life; for instance, a man has less conscience when in love than\nin any other circumstances. Conscience is sometimes put on one side even\nby people who are otherwise honest and straightforward, and infidelity\nrecklessly committed if they are passionately in love--i.e., when the\ninterest of the species has taken possession of them. It would seem,\nindeed, as if they believed themselves conscious of a greater authority\nthan the interests of individuals could ever confer; this is simply\nbecause they are concerned in the interest of the species. Chamfort's\nutterance in this respect is remarkable: _Quand un homme et une femme\nont l'un pour l'autre une passion violente, il me semble toujours que\nquelque soient les obstacles qui les s\u00e9parent, un mari, des parens,\netc.; les deux amans sont l'un \u00e0 l'autre, de par la Nature, qu'ils\ns'appartiennent de droit devin, malgr\u00e9 les lois et les conventions\nhumaines_.... From this standpoint the greater part of the _Decameron_\nseems a mere mocking and jeering on the part of the genius of the\nspecies at the rights and interests of the individual which it treads\nunderfoot. Inequality of rank and all similar relations are put on one\nside with the same indifference and disregarded by the genius of the\nspecies, if they thwart the union of two people passionately in love\nwith one another: it pursues its ends pertaining to endless generations,\nscattering human principles and scruples abroad like chaff.\nFor the same reason, a man will willingly risk every kind of danger, and\neven become courageous, although he may otherwise be faint-hearted. What\na delight we take in watching, either in a play or novel, two young\nlovers fighting for each other--i.e., for the interest of the\nspecies--and their defeat of the old people, who had only in view the\nwelfare of the individual! For the struggling of a pair of lovers seems\nto us so much more important, delightful, and consequently justifiable\nthan any other, as the species is more important than the individual.\nAccordingly, we have as the fundamental subject of almost all comedies\nthe genius of the species with its purposes, running counter to the\npersonal interests of the individuals presented, and, in consequence,\nthreatening to undermine their happiness. As a rule it carries out its\nends, which, in keeping with true poetic justice, satisfies the\nspectator, because the latter feels that the purposes of the species\nwidely surpass those of the individual. Hence he is quite consoled when\nhe finally takes leave of the victorious lovers, sharing with them the\nillusion that they have established their own happiness, while, in\ntruth, they have sacrificed it for the welfare of the species, in\nopposition to the will of the discreet old people.\nIt has been attempted in a few out-of-the-way comedies to reverse this\nstate of things and to effect the happiness of the individuals at the\ncost of the ends of the species; but here the spectator is sensible of\nthe pain inflicted on the genius of the species, and does not find\nconsolation in the advantages that are assured to the individuals.\nTwo very well-known little pieces occur to me as examples of this kind:\n_La reine de 16 ans_, and _Le mariage de raison_.\nIn the love-affairs that are treated in tragedies the lovers, as a rule,\nperish together: the reason for this is that the purposes of the\nspecies, whose tools the lovers were, have been frustrated, as, for\ninstance, in _Romeo and Juliet, Tancred, Don Carlos, Wallenstein, The\nBride of Messina_, and so on.\nA man in love frequently furnishes comic as well as tragic aspects; for\nbeing in the possession of the spirit of the species and controlled by\nit, he no longer belongs to himself, and consequently his line of\nconduct is not in keeping with that of the individual. It is\nfundamentally this that in the higher phases of love gives such a\npoetical and sublime colour, nay, transcendental and hyperphysical turn\nto a man's thoughts, whereby he appears to lose sight of his essentially\nmaterial purpose. He is inspired by the spirit of the species, whose\naffairs are infinitely more important than any which concern mere\nindividuals, in order to establish by special mandate of this spirit the\nexistence of an indefinitely long posterity with _this_ particular and\nprecisely determined nature, which it can receive only from him as\nfather and his loved one as mother, and which, moreover, _as such_ never\ncomes into existence, while the objectivation of the will to live\nexpressly demands this existence. It is the feeling that he is engaged\nin affairs of such transcendent importance that exalts the lover above\neverything earthly, nay, indeed, above himself, and gives such a\nhyperphysical clothing to his physical wishes, that love becomes, even\nin the life of the most prosaic, a poetical episode; and then the affair\noften assumes a comical aspect. That mandate of the will which\nobjectifies itself in the species presents itself in the consciousness\nof the lover under the mask of the anticipation of an infinite\nhappiness, which is to be found in his union with this particular woman.\nThis illusion to a man deeply in love becomes so dazzling that if it\ncannot be attained, life itself not only loses all charm, but appears to\nbe so joyless, hollow, and uninteresting as to make him too disgusted\nwith it to be afraid of the terrors of death; this is why he sometimes\nof his own free will cuts his life short. The will of a man of this kind\nhas become engulfed in that of the species, or the will of the species\nhas obtained so great an ascendency over the will of the individual that\nif such a man cannot be effective in the manifestation of the first, he\ndisdains to be so in the last. The individual in this case is too weak a\nvessel to bear the infinite longing of the will of the species\nconcentrated upon a definite object. When this is the case suicide is\nthe result, and sometimes suicide of the two lovers; unless nature, to\nprevent this, causes insanity, which then enshrouds with its veil the\nconsciousness of so hopeless a condition. The truth of this is confirmed\nyearly by various cases of this description.\nHowever, it is not only unrequited love that leads frequently to a\ntragic end; for requited love more frequently leads to unhappiness than\nto happiness. This is because its demands often so severely clash with\nthe personal welfare of the lover concerned as to undermine it, since\nthe demands are incompatible with the lover's other circumstances, and\nin consequence destroy the plans of life built upon them. Further, love\nfrequently runs counter not only to external circumstances but to the\nindividuality itself, for it may fling itself upon a person who, apart\nfrom the relation of sex, may become hateful, despicable, nay, even\nrepulsive. As the will of the species, however, is so very much stronger\nthan that of the individual, the lover shuts his eyes to all\nobjectionable qualities, overlooks everything, ignores all, and unites\nhimself for ever to the object of his passion. He is so completely\nblinded by this illusion that as soon as the will of the species is\naccomplished the illusion vanishes and leaves in its place a hateful\ncompanion for life. From this it is obvious why we often see very\nintelligent, nay, distinguished men married to dragons and she-devils,\nand why we cannot understand how it was possible for them to make such a\nchoice. Accordingly, the ancients represented _Amor_ as blind. In fact,\nit is possible for a lover to clearly recognise and be bitterly\nconscious of horrid defects in his _fianc\u00e9e's_ disposition and\ncharacter--defects which promise him a life of misery--and yet for him\nnot to be filled with fear:\n\"I ask not, I care not,\nIf guilt's in thy heart;\nI know that I love thee,\nWhatever thou art.\"\nFor, in truth, he is not acting in his own interest but in that of a\nthird person, who has yet to come into existence, albeit he is under the\nimpression that he is acting in his own But it is this very _acting in\nsome one else's interest_ which is everywhere the stamp of greatness and\ngives to passionate love the touch of the sublime, making it a worthy\nsubject for the poet. Finally, a man may both love and hate his beloved\nat the same time. Accordingly, Plato compares a man's love to the love\nof a wolf for a sheep. We have an instance of this kind when a\npassionate lover, in spite of all his exertions and entreaties, cannot\nobtain a hearing upon any terms.\n\"I love and hate her.\"--SHAKESPEARE, _Cymb_. iii. 5.\nWhen hatred is kindled, a man will sometimes go so far as to first kill\nhis beloved and then himself. Examples of this kind are brought before\nour notice yearly in the newspapers. Therefore Goethe says truly:\n\"Bei aller verschm\u00e4hten Liebe, beim h\u00f6llichen Elemente!\nIch wollt', ich w\u00fcsst' was \u00e4rger's, das ich fluchen k\u00f6nnte!\"\nIt is in truth no hyperbole on the part of a lover when he calls his\nbeloved's coldness, or the joy of her vanity, which delights in his\nsuffering, _cruelty_. For he has come under the influence of an impulse\nwhich, akin to the instinct of animals, compels him in spite of all\nreason to unconditionally pursue his end and discard every other; he\ncannot give it up. There has not been one but many a Petrarch, who,\nfailing to have his love requited, has been obliged to drag through life\nas if his feet were either fettered or carried a leaden weight, and give\nvent to his sighs in a lonely forest; nevertheless there was only one\nPetrarch who possessed the true poetic instinct, so that Goethe's\nbeautiful lines are true of him:\n\"Und wenn der Mensch in seiner Quaal verstummt,\nGab mir ein Gott, zu sagen, wie ich leide.\"\nAs a matter of fact, the genius of the species is at continual warfare\nwith the guardian genius of individuals; it is its pursuer and enemy; it\nis always ready to relentlessly destroy personal happiness in order to\ncarry out its ends; indeed, the welfare of whole nations has sometimes\nbeen sacrificed to its caprice. Shakespeare furnishes us with such an\nexample in _Henry VI_ Part III., Act iii., Scenes 2 and 3. This is\nbecause the species, in which lies the germ of our being, has a nearer\nand prior claim upon us than the individual, so that the affairs of the\nspecies are more important than those of the individual. Sensible of\nthis, the ancients personified the genius of the species in Cupid,\nnotwithstanding his having the form of a child, as a hostile and cruel\ngod, and therefore one to be decried as a capricious and despotic demon,\nand yet lord of both gods and men.\n\u03a3\u03c5 \u03b4' \u1f60 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03b5 \u03ba' \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f18\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2.\n(Tu, deorum hominumque tyranne, Amor!)\nMurderous darts, blindness, and wings are Cupid's attributes. The latter\nsignify inconstancy, which as a rule comes with the disillusion\nfollowing possession.\nBecause, for instance, love is based on an illusion and represents what\nis an advantage to the species as an advantage to the individual, the\nillusion necessarily vanishes directly the end of the species has been\nattained. The spirit of the species, which for the time being has got\nthe individual into its possession, now frees him again. Deserted by the\nspirit, he relapses into his original state of narrowness and want; he\nis surprised to find that after all his lofty, heroic, and endless\nattempts to further his own pleasure he has obtained but little; and\ncontrary to his expectation, he finds that he is no happier than he was\nbefore. He discovers that he has been the dupe of the will of the\nspecies. Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus who has been made happy will\ndesert his Ariadne. If Petrarch's passion had been gratified his song\nwould have become silent from that moment, as that of the birds as soon\nas the eggs are laid.\nLet it be said in passing that, however much my metaphysics of love may\ndisplease those in love, the fundamental truth revealed by me would\nenable them more effectually than anything else to overcome their\npassion, if considerations of reason in general could be of any avail.\nThe words of the comic poet of ancient times remain good: _Quae res in\nse neque consilium, neque modum habet ullum, eam consilio regere non\npotes_. People who marry for love do so in the interest of the species\nand not of the individuals. It is true that the persons concerned\nimagine they are promoting their own happiness; but their real aim,\nwhich is one they are unconscious of, is to bring forth an individual\nwhich can be begotten by them alone. This purpose having brought them\ntogether, they ought henceforth to try and make the best of things. But\nit very frequently happens that two people who have been brought\ntogether by this instinctive illusion, which is the essence of\npassionate love, are in every other respect temperamentally different.\nThis becomes apparent when the illusion wears off, as it necessarily\nmust.\nAccordingly, people who marry for love are generally unhappy, for such\npeople look after the welfare of the future generation at the expense of\nthe present. _Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con dolores_ (He who\nmarries for love must live in grief), says the Spanish proverb.\nMarriages _de convenance_, which are generally arranged by the parents,\nwill turn out the reverse. The considerations in this case which control\nthem, whatever their nature may be, are at any rate real and unable to\nvanish of themselves. A marriage of this kind attends to the welfare of\nthe present generation to the detriment of the future, it is true; and\nyet this remains problematical.\nA man who marries for money, and not for love, lives more in the\ninterest of the individual than in that of the species; a condition\nexactly opposed to truth; therefore it is unnatural and rouses a certain\nfeeling of contempt. A girl who against the wish of her parents refuses\nto marry a rich man, still young, and ignores all considerations of\n_convenance_, in order to choose another instinctively to her liking,\nsacrifices her individual welfare to the species. But it is for this\nvery reason that she meets with a certain approval, for she has given\npreference to what was more important and acted in the spirit of nature\n(of the species) more exactly; while the parents advised only in the\nspirit of individual egoism.\nAs the outcome of all this, it seems that to marry means that either the\ninterest of the individual or the interest of the species must suffer.\nAs a rule one or the other is the case, for it is only by the rarest and\nluckiest accident that _convenance_ and passionate love go hand in hand.\nThe wretched condition of most persons physically, morally, and\nintellectually may be partly accounted for by the fact that marriages\nare not generally the result of pure choice and inclination, but of all\nkinds of external considerations and accidental circumstances. However,\nif inclination to a certain degree is taken into consideration, as well\nas convenience, this is as it were a compromise with the genius of the\nspecies. As is well known, happy marriages are few and far between,\nsince marriage is intended to have the welfare of the future generation\nat heart and not the present.\nHowever, let me add for the consolation of the more tender-hearted that\npassionate love is sometimes associated with a feeling of quite another\nkind--namely, real friendship founded on harmony of sentiment, but this,\nhowever, does not exist until the instinct of sex has been extinguished.\nThis friendship will generally spring from the fact that the physical,\nmoral, and intellectual qualities which correspond to and supplement\neach other in two individuals in love, in respect of the child to be\nborn, will also supplement each other in respect of the individuals\nthemselves as opposite qualities of temperament and intellectual\nexcellence, and thereby establish a harmony of sentiment.\nThe whole metaphysics of love which has been treated here is closely\nrelated to my metaphysics in general, and the light it throws upon this\nmay be said to be as follows.\nWe have seen that a man's careful choice, developing through innumerable\ndegrees to passionate love, for the satisfaction of his instinct of sex,\nis based upon the fundamental interest he takes in the constitution of\nthe next generation. This overwhelming interest that he takes verifies\ntwo truths which have been already demonstrated.\nFirst: Man's immortality, which is perpetuated in the future race. For\nthis interest of so active and zealous a nature, which is neither the\nresult of reflection nor intention, springs from the innermost\ncharacteristics and tendencies of our being, could not exist so\ncontinuously or exercise such great power over man if the latter were\nreally transitory and if a race really and totally different to himself\nsucceeded him merely in point of time.\nSecond: That his real nature is more closely allied to the species than\nto the individual. For this interest that he takes in the special nature\nof the species, which is the source of all love, from the most fleeting\nemotion to the most serious passion, is in reality the most important\naffair in each man's life, the successful or unsuccessful issue of which\ntouches him more nearly than anything else. This is why it has been\npre-eminently called the \"affair of the heart.\" Everything that merely\nconcerns one's own person is set aside and sacrificed, if the case\nrequire it, to this interest when it is of a strong and decided nature.\nTherefore in this way man proves that he is more interested in the\nspecies than in the individual, and that he lives more directly in the\ninterest of the species than in that of the individual.\nWhy, then, is a lover so absolutely devoted to every look and turn of\nhis beloved, and ready to make any kind of sacrifice for her? Because\nthe _immortal_ part of him is yearning for her; it is only the _mortal_\npart of him that longs for everything else. That keen and even intense\nlonging for a particular woman is accordingly a direct pledge of the\nimmortality of the essence of our being and of its perpetuity in the\nspecies.\nTo regard this perpetuity as something unimportant and insufficient is\nan error, arising from the fact that in thinking of the continuity of\nthe species we only think of the future existence of beings similar to\nourselves, but in no respect, however, identical with us; and again,\nstarting from knowledge directed towards without, we only grasp the\nouter form of the species as it presents itself to us, and do not take\ninto consideration its inner nature. It is precisely this inner nature\nthat lies at the foundation of our own consciousness as its kernel, and\ntherefore is more direct than our consciousness itself, and as\nthing-in-itself exempt from the _principium individuationis_--is in\nreality identical and the same in all individuals, whether they exist at\nthe same or at different times.\nThis, then, is the will to live--that is to say, it is exactly _that\nwhich_ so intensely desires both life and continuance, and which\naccordingly remains unharmed and unaffected by death. Further, its\npresent state cannot be improved, and while there is life it is certain\nof the unceasing sufferings and death of the individual. The _denial_ of\nthe will to live is reserved to free it from this, as the means by which\nthe individual will breaks away from the stem of the species, and\nsurrenders that existence in it.\nWe are wanting both in ideas and all data as to what it is after that.\nWe can only indicate it as something which is free to be will to live or\nnot to live. Buddhism distinguishes the latter case by the word\n_Nirvana_. It is the point which as such remains for ever impenetrable\nto all human knowledge.\nLooking at the turmoil of life from this standpoint we find all occupied\nwith its want and misery, exerting all their strength in order to\nsatisfy its endless needs and avert manifold suffering, without,\nhowever, daring to expect anything else in return than merely the\npreservation of this tormented individual existence for a short span of\ntime. And yet, amid all this turmoil we see a pair of lovers exchanging\nlonging glances--yet why so secretly, timidly, and stealthily? Because\nthese lovers are traitors secretly striving to perpetuate all this\nmisery and turmoil that otherwise would come to a timely end.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[17] Ch. xxvi. 23.\n[18] _De vita longa_ i. 5.\nPHYSIOGNOMY.\nThat the outside reflects the inner man, and that the face expresses his\nwhole character, is an obvious supposition and accordingly a safe one,\ndemonstrated as it is in the desire people have _to see_ on all\noccasions a man who has distinguished himself by something good or evil,\nor produced some exceptional work; or if this is denied them, at any\nrate to hear from others _what he looks like_. This is why, on the one\nhand, they go to places where they conjecture he is to be found; and on\nthe other, why the press, and especially the English press, tries to\ndescribe him in a minute and striking way; he is soon brought visibly\nbefore us either by a painter or an engraver; and finally, photography,\non that account so highly prized, meets this necessity in a most perfect\nway.\nIt is also proved in everyday life that each one inspects the\nphysiognomy of those he comes in contact with, and first of all secretly\ntries to discover their moral and intellectual character from their\nfeatures. This could not be the case if, as some foolish people state,\nthe outward appearance of a man is of no importance; nay, if the soul is\none thing and the body another, and the latter related to the soul as\nthe coat is to the man himself.\nRather is every human face a hieroglyph, which, to be sure, admits of\nbeing deciphered--nay, the whole alphabet of which we carry about with\nus. Indeed, the face of a man, as a rule, bespeaks more interesting\nmatter than his tongue, for it is the compendium of all which he will\never say, as it is the register of all his thoughts and aspirations.\nMoreover, the tongue only speaks the thoughts of one man, while the face\nexpresses a thought of nature. Therefore it is worth while to observe\neverybody attentively; even if they are not worth talking to. Every\nindividual is worthy of observation as a single thought of nature; so is\nbeauty in the highest degree, for it is a higher and more general\nconception of nature: it is her thought of a species. This is why we are\nso captivated by beauty. It is a fundamental and principal thought of\nNature; whereas the individual is only a secondary thought, a corollary.\nIn secret, everybody goes upon the principle that a man _is_ what he\n_looks_; but the difficulty lies in its application. The ability to\napply it is partly innate and partly acquired by experience; but no one\nunderstands it thoroughly, for even the most experienced may make a\nmistake. Still, it is not the face that deceives, whatever Figaro may\nsay, but it is we who are deceived in reading what is not there. The\ndeciphering of the face is certainly a great and difficult art. Its\nprinciples can never be learnt _in abstracto_. Its first condition is\nthat the man must be looked at from a _purely objective_ point of view;\nwhich is not so easy to do. As soon as, for instance, there is the\nslightest sign of dislike, or affection, or fear, or hope, or even the\nthought of the impression which we ourselves are making on him--in\nshort, as soon as anything of a subjective nature is present, the\nhieroglyphics become confused and falsified. The sound of a language is\nonly heard by one who does not understand it, because in thinking of the\nsignificance one is not conscious of the sign itself; and similarly the\nphysiognomy of a man is only seen by one to whom it is still\nstrange--that is to say, by one who has not become accustomed to his\nface through seeing him often or talking to him. Accordingly it is,\nstrictly speaking, the first glance that gives one a purely objective\nimpression of a face, and makes it possible for one to decipher it. A\nsmell only affects us when we first perceive it, and it is the first\nglass of wine which gives us its real taste; in the same way, it is only\nwhen we see a face for the first time that it makes a full impression\nupon us. Therefore one should carefully attend to the first impression;\none should make a note of it, nay, write it down if the man is of\npersonal importance--that is, if one can trust one's own sense of\nphysiognomy. Subsequent acquaintance and intercourse will erase that\nimpression, but it will be verified one day in the future.\n_En passant_, let us not conceal from ourselves the fact that this first\nimpression is as a rule extremely disagreeable: but how little there is\nin the majority of faces! With the exception of those that are\nbeautiful, good-natured, and intellectual--that is, the very few and\nexceptional,--I believe a new face for the most part gives a sensitive\nperson a sensation akin to a shock, since the disagreeable impression is\npresented in a new and surprising combination.\nAs a rule it is indeed _a sorry sight_. There are individuals whose\nfaces are stamped with such na\u00efve vulgarity and lowness of character,\nsuch an animal limitation of intelligence, that one wonders how they\ncare to go out with such a face and do not prefer to wear a mask. Nay,\nthere are faces a mere glance at which makes one feel contaminated. One\ncannot therefore blame people, who are in a position to do so, if they\nseek solitude and escape the painful sensation of \"_seeing new faces_.\"\nThe _metaphysical_ explanation of this rests on the consideration that\nthe individuality of each person is exactly that by which he should be\nreclaimed and corrected.\nIf any one, on the other hand, will be content with a _psychological_\nexplanation, let him ask himself what kind of physiognomy can be\nexpected in those whose minds, their whole life long, have scarcely ever\nentertained anything but petty, mean, and miserable thoughts, and\nvulgar, selfish, jealous, wicked, and spiteful desires. Each one of\nthese thoughts and desires has left its impress on the face for the\nlength of time it existed; all these marks, by frequent repetition, have\neventually become furrows and blemishes, if one may say so. Therefore\nthe appearance of the majority of people is calculated to give one a\nshock at first sight, and it is only by degrees that one becomes\naccustomed to a face--that is to say, becomes so indifferent to the\nimpression as to be no longer affected by it.\nBut that the predominating facial expression is formed by countless\nfleeting and characteristic contortions is also the reason why the faces\nof intellectual men only become moulded gradually, and indeed only\nattain their sublime expression in old age; whilst portraits of them in\ntheir youth only show the first traces of it. But, on the other hand,\nwhat has just been said about the shock one receives at first sight\ncoincides with the above remark, that it is only at first sight that a\nface makes its true and full impression. In order to get a purely\nobjective and true impression of it, we must stand in no kind of\nrelation to the person, nay, if possible, we must not even have spoken\nto him. Conversation makes one in some measure friendly disposed, and\nbrings us into a certain _rapport_, a reciprocal _subjective_ relation,\nwhich immediately interferes with our taking an objective view. As\neverybody strives to win either respect or friendship for himself, a man\nwho is being observed will immediately resort to every art of\ndissembling, and corrupt us with his airs, hypocrisies, and flatteries;\nso that in a short time we no longer see what the first impression had\nclearly shown us. It is said that \"most people gain on further\nacquaintance\" but what ought to be said is that \"they delude us\" on\nfurther acquaintance. But when these bad traits have an opportunity of\nshowing themselves later on, our first impression generally receives its\njustification. Sometimes a further acquaintance is a hostile one, in\nwhich case it will not be found that people gain by it. Another reason\nfor the apparent advantage of a further acquaintance is, that the man\nwhose first appearance repels us, as soon as we converse with him no\nlonger shows his true being and character, but his education as\nwell--that is to say, not only what he really is by nature, but what he\nhas appropriated from the common wealth of mankind; three-fourths of\nwhat he says does not belong to him, but has been acquired from without;\nso that we are often surprised to hear such a minotaur speak so humanly.\nAnd on a still further acquaintance, the brutality of which his face\ngave promise, will reveal itself in all its glory. Therefore a man who\nis gifted with a keen sense of physiognomy should pay careful attention\nto those verdicts prior to a further acquaintance, and therefore\ngenuine. For the face of a man expresses exactly what he is, and if he\ndeceives us it is not his fault but ours. On the other hand, the words\nof a man merely state what he thinks, more frequently only what he has\nlearnt, or it may be merely what he pretends to think. Moreover, when we\nspeak to him, nay, only hear others speak to him, our attention is taken\naway from his real physiognomy; because it is the substance, that which\nis given fundamentally, and we disregard it; and we only pay attention\nto its pathognomy, its play of feature while speaking. This, however, is\nso arranged that the good side is turned upwards.\nWhen Socrates said to a youth who was introduced to him so that he might\ntest his capabilities, \"Speak so that I may see you\" (taking it for\ngranted that he did not simply mean \"hearing\" by \"seeing\"), he was right\nin so far as it is only in speaking that the features and especially the\neyes of a man become animated, and his intellectual powers and\ncapabilities imprint their stamp on his features: we are then in a\nposition to estimate provisionally the degree and capacity of his\nintelligence; which was precisely Socrates' aim in that case. But, on\nthe other hand, it is to be observed, firstly, that this rule does not\napply to the _moral_ qualities of a man, which lie deeper; and secondly,\nthat what is gained from an _objective_ point of view by the clearer\ndevelopment of a man's countenance while he is speaking, is again from a\n_subjective_ point of view lost, because of the personal relation into\nwhich he immediately enters with us, occasioning a slight fascination,\ndoes not leave us unprejudiced observers, as has already been explained.\nTherefore, from this last standpoint it might be more correct to say:\n\"Do not speak in order that I may see you.\"\nFor to obtain a pure and fundamental grasp of a man's physiognomy one\nmust observe him when he is alone and left to himself. Any kind of\nsociety and conversation with another throw a reflection upon him which\nis not his own, mostly to his advantage; for he thereby is placed in a\ncondition of action and reaction which exalts him. But, on the contrary,\nif he is alone and left to himself immersed in the depths of his own\nthoughts and sensations, it is only then that he is absolutely and\nwholly _himself_. And any one with a keen, penetrating eye for\nphysiognomy can grasp the general character of his whole being at a\nglance. For on his face, regarded in and by itself, is indicated the\nground tone of all his thoughts and efforts, the _arr\u00eat irrevocable_ of\nhis future, and of which he is only conscious when alone.\nThe science of physiognomy is one of the principal means of a knowledge\nof mankind: arts of dissimulation do not come within the range of\nphysiognomy, but within that of mere pathognomy and mimicry. This is\nprecisely why I recommend the physiognomy of a man to be studied when he\nis alone and left to his own thoughts, and before he has been conversed\nwith; partly because it is only then that his physiognomy can be seen\npurely and simply, since in conversation pathognomy immediately steps\nin, and he then resorts to the arts of dissimulation which he has\nacquired; and partly because personal intercourse, even of the slightest\nnature, makes us prejudiced, and in consequence impairs our judgment.\nConcerning our physiognomy in general, it is still to be observed that\nit is much easier to discover the intellectual capacities of a man than\nhis moral character. The intellectual capacities take a much more\noutward direction. They are expressed not only in the face and play of\nhis features, but also in his walk, nay, in every movement, however\nslight it may be. One could perhaps discriminate from behind between a\nblockhead, a fool, and a man of genius. A clumsy awkwardness\ncharacterises every movement of the blockhead; folly imprints its mark\non every gesture, and so do genius and a reflective nature. Hence the\noutcome of La Bruyere's remark: _Il n'y a rien de si d\u00e9li\u00e9, de si\nsimple, et de si imperceptible o\u00f9 il n'y entrent des mani\u00e8res, qui nous\nd\u00e9c\u00e8lent: un sot ni n'entre, ni ne sort, ni ne s'assied, ni ne se l\u00e8ve,\nni ne se tait, ni n'est sur ses jambes, comme un homme d'esprit_. This\naccounts for, by the way, that instinct _stir et prompt_ which,\naccording to Helvetius, ordinary people have of recognising people of\ngenius and of running away from them. This is to be accounted for by the\nfact that the larger and more developed the brain, and the thinner, in\nrelation to it, the spine and nerves, the greater not only is the\nintelligence, but also at the same time the mobility and pliancy of all\nthe limbs; because they are controlled more immediately and decisively\nby the brain; consequently everything depends more on a single thread,\nevery movement of which precisely expresses its purpose. The whole\nmatter is analogous to, nay dependent on, the fact that the higher an\nanimal stands in the scale of development, the easier can it be killed\nby wounding it in a single place. Take, for instance, batrachia: they\nare as heavy, clumsy, and slow in their movements as they are\nunintelligent, and at the same time extremely tenacious of life. This is\nexplained by the fact that with a little brain they have a very thick\nspine and nerves. But gait and movement of the arms are for the most\npart functions of the brain; because the limbs receive their motion, and\neven the slightest modification of it, from the brain through the medium\nof the spinal nerves; and this is precisely why voluntary movements tire\nus. This feeling of fatigue, like that of pain, has its seat in the\nbrain, and not as we suppose in the limbs, hence motion promotes sleep;\non the other hand, those motions that are not excited by the brain, that\nis to say, the involuntary motions of organic life, of the heart and\nlungs, go on without causing fatigue: and as thought as well as motion\nis a function of the brain, the character of its activity is denoted in\nboth, according to the nature of the individual. Stupid people move like\nlay figures, while every joint of intellectual people speaks for itself.\nIntellectual qualities are much better discerned, however, in the face\nthan in gestures and movements, in the shape and size of the forehead,\nin the contraction and movement of the features, and especially in the\neye; from the little, dull, sleepy-looking eye of the pig, through all\ngradations, to the brilliant sparkling eye of the genius. The _look of\nwisdom_, even of the best kind, is different from that of _genius_,\nsince it bears the stamp of serving the will; while that of the latter\nis free from it. Therefore the anecdote which Squarzafichi relates in\nhis life of Petrarch, and has taken from Joseph Brivius, a contemporary,\nis quite credible--namely, that when Petrarch was at the court of\nVisconti, and among many men and titled people, Galeazzo Visconti asked\nhis son, who was still a boy in years and was afterwards the first Duke\nof Milan, to pick out _the wisest man_ of those present. The boy looked\nat every one for a while, when he seized Petrarch's hand and led him to\nhis father, to the great admiration of all present. For nature imprints\nher stamp of dignity so distinctly on the distinguished among mankind\nthat a child can perceive it. Therefore I should advise my sagacious\ncountrymen, if they ever again wish to trumpet a commonplace person as a\ngenius for the period of thirty years, not to choose for that end such\nan inn-keeper's physiognomy as was possessed by Hegel, upon whose face\nnature had written in her clearest handwriting the familiar title,\n_commonplace person_. But what applies to intellectual qualities does\nnot apply to the moral character of mankind; its physiognomy is much\nmore difficult to perceive, because, being of a metaphysical nature, it\nlies much deeper, and although moral character is connected with the\nconstitution and with the organism, it is not so immediately connected,\nhowever, with definite parts of its system as is intellect. Hence, while\neach one makes a public show of his intelligence, with which he is in\ngeneral quite satisfied, and tries to display it at every opportunity,\nthe moral qualities are seldom brought to light, nay, most people\nintentionally conceal them; and long practice makes them acquire great\nmastery in hiding them.\nMeanwhile, as has been explained above, wicked thoughts and worthless\nendeavours gradually leave their traces on the face, and especially the\neyes. Therefore, judging by physiognomy, we can easily guarantee that a\nman will never produce an immortal work; but not that he will never\ncommit a great crime.\nON SUICIDE.\nAs far as I can see, it is only the followers of monotheistic, that is\nof Jewish, religions that regard suicide as a crime. This is the more\nstriking as there is no forbiddance of it, or even positive disapproval\nof it, to be found either in the New Testament or the Old; so that\nteachers of religion have to base their disapprobation of suicide on\ntheir own philosophical grounds; these, however, are so bad that they\ntry to compensate for the weakness of their arguments by strongly\nexpressing their abhorrence of the act--that is to say, by abusing it.\nWe are told that suicide is an act of the greatest cowardice, that it is\nonly possible to a madman, and other absurdities of a similar nature; or\nthey make use of the perfectly senseless expression that it is\n\"_wrong_,\" while it is perfectly clear that no one has such indisputable\nright over anything in the world as over his own person and life.\nSuicide, as has been said, is computed a crime, rendering\ninevitable--especially in vulgar, bigoted England--an ignominious\nburial and the confiscation of the property; this is why the jury almost\nalways bring in the verdict of insanity. Let one's own moral feelings\ndecide the matter for one. Compare the impression made upon one by the\nnews that a friend has committed a crime, say a murder, an act of\ncruelty or deception, or theft, with the news that he has died a\nvoluntary death. Whilst news of the first kind will incite intense\nindignation, the greatest displeasure, and a desire for punishment or\nrevenge, news of the second will move us to sorrow and compassion;\nmoreover, we will frequently have a feeling of admiration for his\ncourage rather than one of moral disapproval, which accompanies a wicked\nact. Who has not had acquaintances, friends, relatives, who have\nvoluntarily left this world? And are we to think of them with horror as\ncriminals? _Nego ac pernego_! I am rather of the opinion that the clergy\nshould be challenged to state their authority for stamping--from the\npulpit or in their writings--as a _crime_ an act which has been\ncommitted by many people honoured and loved by us, and refusing an\nhonourable burial to those who have of their own free will left the\nworld. They cannot produce any kind of Biblical authority, nay, they\nhave no philosophical arguments that are at all valid; and it is\n_reasons_ that we want; mere empty phrases or words of abuse we cannot\naccept. If the criminal law forbids suicide, that is not a reason that\nholds good in the church; moreover, it is extremely ridiculous, for what\npunishment can frighten those who seek death? When a man is punished for\ntrying to commit suicide, it is his clumsy failure that is punished.\nThe ancients were also very far from looking at the matter in this\nlight. Pliny says: \"_Vitam quidem non adeo expetendam censemus, ut\nquoque modo trahenda sit. Quisquis es talis, aeque moriere, etiam cum\nobscoenus vixeris, aut nefandus. Quapropter hoc primum quisque in\nremediis animi sui habeat: ex omnibus bonis, quae homini tribuit natura,\nnullum melius esse tempestiva morte: idque in ea optimum, quod illam\nsibi quisque praestare poterit_.\" He also says: \"_Ne Deum quidem posse\nomnia. Namque nec sibi potest mortem consciscere, si velit, quod homini\ndedit optimum in taniis vitae poenis_,\" etc.\nIn Massilia and on the island of Ceos a hemlock-potion was offered in\npublic by the magistrate to those who could give valid reasons for\nquitting this life. And how many heroes and wise men of ancient times\nhave not ended their lives by a voluntary death! To be sure, Aristotle\nsays \"Suicide is a wrong against the State, although not against the\nperson;\" Stob\u00e6us, however, in his treatise on the Peripatetic ethics\nuses this sentence: _\u03c6\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd\n\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f00\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2.

Further, it is well\nknown that the Hindoos often look upon suicide as a religious act, as,\nfor instance, the self-sacrifice of widows, throwing oneself under the\nwheels of the chariot of the god at Juggernaut, or giving oneself to the\ncrocodiles in the Ganges or casting oneself in the holy tanks in the\ntemples, and so on. It is the same on the stage--that mirror of life.\nFor instance, in the famous Chinese play, _L'Orphelin de la Chine_,[19]\nalmost all the noble characters end by suicide, without indicating\nanywhere or it striking the spectator that they were committing a crime.\nAt bottom it is the same on our own stage; for instance, Palmira in\n_Mahomet_, Mortimer in _Maria Stuart_, Othello, Countess Terzky. Is\nHamlet's monologue the meditation of a criminal? He merely states that\nconsidering the nature of the world, death would be certainly\npreferable, if we were sure that by it we should be annihilated. But\n_there lies the rub_! But the reasons brought to bear against suicide by\nthe priests of monotheistic, that is of Jewish religions, and by those\nphilosophers who adapt themselves to it, are weak sophisms easily\ncontradicted.[20] Hume has furnished the most thorough refutation of\nthem in his _Essay on Suicide_, which did not appear until after his\ndeath, and was immediately suppressed by the shameful bigotry and gross\necclesiastical tyranny existing in England. Hence, only a very few\ncopies of it were sold secretly, and those at a dear price; and for this\nand another treatise of that great man we are indebted to a reprint\npublished at Basle. That a purely philosophical treatise originating\nfrom one of the greatest thinkers and writers of England, which refuted\nwith cold reason the current arguments against suicide, must steal about\nin that country as if it were a fraudulent piece of work until it found\nprotection in a foreign country, is a great disgrace to the English\nnation. At the same time it shows what a good conscience the Church has\non a question of this kind. The only valid moral reason against suicide\nhas been explained in my chief work. It is this: that suicide prevents\nthe attainment of the highest moral aim, since it substitutes a real\nrelease from this world of misery for one that is merely apparent. But\nthere is a very great difference between a mistake and a crime, and it\nis as a crime that the Christian clergy wish to stamp it. Christianity's\ninmost truth is that suffering (the Cross) is the real purpose of life;\nhence it condemns suicide as thwarting this end, while the ancients,\nfrom a lower point of view, approved of it, nay, honoured it. This\nargument against suicide is nevertheless ascetic, and only holds good\nfrom a much higher ethical standpoint than has ever been taken by moral\nphilosophers in Europe. But if we come down from that very high\nstandpoint, there is no longer a valid moral reason for condemning\nsuicide. The extraordinarily active zeal with which the clergy of\nmonotheistic religions attack suicide is not supported either by the\nBible or by any valid reasons; so it looks as if their zeal must be\ninstigated by some secret motive. May it not be that the voluntary\nsacrificing of one's life is a poor compliment to him who said, \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd?[21]\nIn that case it would be another example of the gross optimism of these\nreligions denouncing suicide, in order to avoid being denounced by it.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAs a rule, it will be found that as soon as the terrors of life outweigh\nthe terrors of death a man will put an end to his life. The resistance\nof the terrors of death is, however, considerable; they stand like a\nsentinel at the gate that leads out of life. Perhaps there is no one\nliving who would not have already put an end to his life if this end had\nbeen something that was purely negative, a sudden cessation of\nexistence. But there is something positive about it, namely, the\ndestruction of the body. And this alarms a man simply because his body\nis the manifestation of the will to live.\nMeanwhile, the fight as a rule with these sentinels is not so hard as it\nmay appear to be from a distance; in consequence, it is true, of the\nantagonism between mental and physical suffering. For instance, if we\nsuffer very great bodily pain, or if the pain lasts a long time, we\nbecome indifferent to all other troubles: our recovery is what we desire\nmost dearly. In the same way, great mental suffering makes us insensible\nto bodily suffering: we despise it. Nay, if it outweighs the other, we\nfind it a beneficial distraction, a pause in our mental suffering. And\nso it is that suicide becomes easy; for the bodily pain that is bound up\nwith it loses all importance in the eyes of one who is tormented by\nexcessive mental suffering. This is particularly obvious in the case of\nthose who are driven to commit suicide through some purely morbid and\ndiscordant feeling. They have no feelings to overcome; they do not need\nto rush at it, but as soon as the keeper who looks after them leaves\nthem for two minutes they quickly put an end to their life.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhen in some horrid and frightful dream we reach the highest pitch of\nterror, it awakens us, scattering all the monsters of the night. The\nsame thing happens in the dream of life, when the greatest degree of\nterror compels us to break it off.\n*       *       *       *       *\nSuicide may also be looked upon as an experiment, as a question which\nman puts to Nature and compels her to answer. It asks, what change a\nman's existence and knowledge of things experience through death? It is\nan awkward experiment to make; for it destroys the very consciousness\nthat awaits the answer.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[19] Translated by St. Julien, 1834.\n[20] See my treatise on the _Foundation of Morals_, \u00a7 5.\n[21] Bd.

The\ntranslation of the book has consequently been a matter of no little\ndifficulty. It was found that extensive alteration of the long and\noccasionally involved sentences, however likely to prove conducive to a\nsatisfactory English style, tended not only to obliterate the form of the\noriginal but even to imperil the meaning. Where a choice has had to be\nmade, the alternative of a somewhat slavish adherence to Schopenhauer\u2019s\n_ipsissima verba_ has accordingly been preferred to that of inaccuracy.\nThe result is a piece of work which leaves much to be desired, but which\nhas yet consistently sought to reproduce faithfully the spirit as well as\nthe letter of the original.\nAs regards the rendering of the technical terms about which there has been\nso much controversy, the equivalents used have only been adopted after\ncareful consideration of their meaning in the theory of knowledge. For\nexample, \u201cVorstellung\u201d has been rendered by \u201cidea,\u201d in preference to\n\u201crepresentation,\u201d which is neither accurate, intelligible, nor elegant.\n\u201cIdee,\u201d is translated by the same word, but spelled with a\ncapital,\u2014\u201cIdea.\u201d Again, \u201cAnschauung\u201d has been rendered according to the\ncontext, either by \u201cperception\u201d simply, or by \u201cintuition or perception.\u201d\nNotwithstanding statements to the contrary in the text, the book is\nprobably quite intelligible in itself, apart from the treatise \u201cOn the\nFourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason.\u201d It has, however,\nbeen considered desirable to add an abstract of the latter work in an\nappendix to the third volume of this translation.\nR. B. H.\nJ. K.\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\nI propose to point out here how this book must be read in order to be\nthoroughly understood. By means of it I only intend to impart a single\nthought. Yet, notwithstanding all my endeavours, I could find no shorter\nway of imparting it than this whole book. I hold this thought to be that\nwhich has very long been sought for under the name of philosophy, and the\ndiscovery of which is therefore regarded by those who are familiar with\nhistory as quite as impossible as the discovery of the philosopher\u2019s\nstone, although it was already said by Pliny: _Quam multa fieri non posse,\npriusquam sint facta, judicantur?_ (Hist. nat. 7, 1.)\nAccording as we consider the different aspects of this one thought which I\nam about to impart, it exhibits itself as that which we call metaphysics,\nthat which we call ethics, and that which we call \u00e6sthetics; and certainly\nit must be all this if it is what I have already acknowledged I take it to\nbe.\nA _system of thought_ must always have an architectonic connection or\ncoherence, that is, a connection in which one part always supports the\nother, though the latter does not support the former, in which ultimately\nthe foundation supports all the rest without being supported by it, and\nthe apex is supported without supporting. On the other hand, a _single\nthought_, however comprehensive it may be, must preserve the most perfect\nunity. If it admits of being broken up into parts to facilitate its\ncommunication, the connection of these parts must yet be organic, _i.e._,\nit must be a connection in which every part supports the whole just as\nmuch as it is supported by it, a connection in which there is no first and\nno last, in which the whole thought gains distinctness through every part,\nand even the smallest part cannot be completely understood unless the\nwhole has already been grasped. A book, however, must always have a first\nand a last line, and in this respect will always remain very unlike an\norganism, however like one its content may be: thus form and matter are\nhere in contradiction.\nIt is self-evident that under these circumstances no other advice can be\ngiven as to how one may enter into the thought explained in this work than\n_to read the book twice_, and the first time with great patience, a\npatience which is only to be derived from the belief, voluntarily\naccorded, that the beginning presupposes the end almost as much as the end\npresupposes the beginning, and that all the earlier parts presuppose the\nlater almost as much as the later presuppose the earlier. I say \u201calmost;\u201d\nfor this is by no means absolutely the case, and I have honestly and\nconscientiously done all that was possible to give priority to that which\nstands least in need of explanation from what follows, as indeed generally\nto everything that can help to make the thought as easy to comprehend and\nas distinct as possible. This might indeed to a certain extent be achieved\nif it were not that the reader, as is very natural, thinks, as he reads,\nnot merely of what is actually said, but also of its possible\nconsequences, and thus besides the many contradictions actually given of\nthe opinions of the time, and presumably of the reader, there may be added\nas many more which are anticipated and imaginary. That, then, which is\nreally only misunderstanding, must take the form of active disapproval,\nand it is all the more difficult to recognise that it is misunderstanding,\nbecause although the laboriously-attained clearness of the explanation and\ndistinctness of the expression never leaves the immediate sense of what is\nsaid doubtful, it cannot at the same time express its relations to all\nthat remains to be said. Therefore, as we have said, the first perusal\ndemands patience, founded on confidence that on a second perusal much, or\nall, will appear in an entirely different light. Further, the earnest\nendeavour to be more completely and even more easily comprehended in the\ncase of a very difficult subject, must justify occasional repetition.\nIndeed the structure of the whole, which is organic, not a mere chain,\nmakes it necessary sometimes to touch on the same point twice. Moreover\nthis construction, and the very close connection of all the parts, has not\nleft open to me the division into chapters and paragraphs which I should\notherwise have regarded as very important, but has obliged me to rest\nsatisfied with four principal divisions, as it were four aspects of one\nthought. In each of these four books it is especially important to guard\nagainst losing sight, in the details which must necessarily be discussed,\nof the principal thought to which they belong, and the progress of the\nwhole exposition. I have thus expressed the first, and like those which\nfollow, unavoidable demand upon the reader, who holds the philosopher in\nsmall favour just because he himself is a philosopher.\nThe second demand is this, that the introduction be read before the book\nitself, although it is not contained in the book, but appeared five years\nearlier under the title, \u201c_Ueber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom\nzureichenden Grunde: eine philosophische Abhandlung_\u201d (On the fourfold\nroot of the principle of sufficient reason: a philosophical essay).\nWithout an acquaintance with this introduction and propadeutic it is\nabsolutely impossible to understand the present work properly, and the\ncontent of that essay will always be presupposed in this work just as if\nit were given with it. Besides, even if it had not preceded this book by\nseveral years, it would not properly have been placed before it as an\nintroduction, but would have been incorporated in the first book. As it\nis, the first book does not contain what was said in the earlier essay,\nand it therefore exhibits a certain incompleteness on account of these\ndeficiencies, which must always be supplied by reference to it. However,\nmy disinclination was so great either to quote myself or laboriously to\nstate again in other words what I had already said once in an adequate\nmanner, that I preferred this course, notwithstanding the fact that I\nmight now be able to give the content of that essay a somewhat better\nexpression, chiefly by freeing it from several conceptions which resulted\nfrom the excessive influence which the Kantian philosophy had over me at\nthe time, such as\u2014categories, outer and inner sense, and the like. But\neven there these conceptions only occur because as yet I had never really\nentered deeply into them, therefore only by the way and quite out of\nconnection with the principal matter. The correction of such passages in\nthat essay will consequently take place of its own accord in the mind of\nthe reader through his acquaintance with the present work. But only if we\nhave fully recognised by means of that essay what the principle of\nsufficient reason is and signifies, what its validity extends to, and what\nit does not extend to, and that that principle is not before all things,\nand the whole world merely in consequence of it, and in conformity to it,\na corollary, as it were, of it; but rather that it is merely the form in\nwhich the object, of whatever kind it may be, which is always conditioned\nby the subject, is invariably known so far as the subject is a knowing\nindividual: only then will it be possible to enter into the method of\nphilosophy which is here attempted for the first time, and which is\ncompletely different from all previous methods.\nBut the same disinclination to repeat myself word for word, or to say the\nsame thing a second time in other and worse words, after I have deprived\nmyself of the better, has occasioned another defect in the first book of\nthis work. For I have omitted all that is said in the first chapter of my\nessay \u201cOn Sight and Colour,\u201d which would otherwise have found its place\nhere, word for word. Therefore the knowledge of this short, earlier work\nis also presupposed.\nFinally, the third demand I have to make on the reader might indeed be\ntacitly assumed, for it is nothing but an acquaintance with the most\nimportant phenomenon that has appeared in philosophy for two thousand\nyears, and that lies so near us: I mean the principal writings of Kant. It\nseems to me, in fact, as indeed has already been said by others, that the\neffect these writings produce in the mind to which they truly speak is\nvery like that of the operation for cataract on a blind man: and if we\nwish to pursue the simile further, the aim of my own work may be described\nby saying that I have sought to put into the hands of those upon whom that\noperation has been successfully performed a pair of spectacles suitable to\neyes that have recovered their sight\u2014spectacles of whose use that\noperation is the absolutely necessary condition. Starting then, as I do to\na large extent, from what has been accomplished by the great Kant, I have\nyet been enabled, just on account of my earnest study of his writings, to\ndiscover important errors in them. These I have been obliged to separate\nfrom the rest and prove to be false, in order that I might be able to\npresuppose and apply what is true and excellent in his doctrine, pure and\nfreed from error. But not to interrupt and complicate my own exposition by\na constant polemic against Kant, I have relegated this to a special\nappendix. It follows then, from what has been said, that my work\npresupposes a knowledge of this appendix just as much as it presupposes a\nknowledge of the philosophy of Kant; and in this respect it would\ntherefore be advisable to read the appendix first, all the more as its\ncontent is specially related to the first book of the present work. On the\nother hand, it could not be avoided, from the nature of the case, that\nhere and there the appendix also should refer to the text of the work; and\nthe only result of this is, that the appendix, as well as the principal\npart of the work, must be read twice.\nThe philosophy of Kant, then, is the only philosophy with which a thorough\nacquaintance is directly presupposed in what we have to say here. But if,\nbesides this, the reader has lingered in the school of the divine Plato,\nhe will be so much the better prepared to hear me, and susceptible to what\nI say. And if, indeed, in addition to this he is a partaker of the benefit\nconferred by the Vedas, the access to which, opened to us through the\nUpanishads, is in my eyes the greatest advantage which this still young\ncentury enjoys over previous ones, because I believe that the influence of\nthe Sanscrit literature will penetrate not less deeply than did the\nrevival of Greek literature in the fifteenth century: if, I say, the\nreader has also already received and assimilated the sacred, primitive\nIndian wisdom, then is he best of all prepared to hear what I have to say\nto him. My work will not speak to him, as to many others, in a strange and\neven hostile tongue; for, if it does not sound too vain, I might express\nthe opinion that each one of the individual and disconnected aphorisms\nwhich make up the Upanishads may be deduced as a consequence from the\nthought I am going to impart, though the converse, that my thought is to\nbe found in the Upanishads, is by no means the case.\nBut most readers have already grown angry with impatience, and burst into\nreproaches with difficulty kept back so long. How can I venture to present\na book to the public under conditions and demands the first two of which\nare presumptuous and altogether immodest, and this at a time when there is\nsuch a general wealth of special ideas, that in Germany alone they are\nmade common property through the press, in three thousand valuable,\noriginal, and absolutely indispensable works every year, besides\ninnumerable periodicals, and even daily papers; at a time when especially\nthere is not the least deficiency of entirely original and profound\nphilosophers, but in Germany alone there are more of them alive at the\nsame time, than several centuries could formerly boast of in succession to\neach other? How is one ever to come to the end, asks the indignant reader,\nif one must set to work upon a book in such a fashion?\nAs I have absolutely nothing to advance against these reproaches, I only\nhope for some small thanks from such readers for having warned them in\ntime, so that they may not lose an hour over a book which it would be\nuseless to read without complying with the demands that have been made,\nand which should therefore be left alone, particularly as apart from this\nwe might wager a great deal that it can say nothing to them, but rather\nthat it will always be only _pancorum hominum_, and must therefore quietly\nand modestly wait for the few whose unusual mode of thought may find it\nenjoyable. For apart from the difficulties and the effort which it\nrequires from the reader, what cultured man of this age, whose knowledge\nhas almost reached the august point at which the paradoxical and the false\nare all one to it, could bear to meet thoughts almost on every page that\ndirectly contradict that which he has yet himself established once for all\nas true and undeniable? And then, how disagreeably disappointed will many\na one be if he finds no mention here of what he believes it is precisely\nhere he ought to look for, because his method of speculation agrees with\nthat of a great living philosopher,(1) who has certainly written pathetic\nbooks, and who only has the trifling weakness that he takes all he learned\nand approved before his fifteenth year for inborn ideas of the human mind.\nWho could stand all this? Therefore my advice is simply to lay down the\nbook.\nBut I fear I shall not escape even thus. The reader who has got as far as\nthe preface and been stopped by it, has bought the book for cash, and asks\nhow he is to be indemnified. My last refuge is now to remind him that he\nknows how to make use of a book in several ways, without exactly reading\nit. It may fill a gap in his library as well as many another, where,\nneatly bound, it will certainly look well. Or he can lay it on the\ntoilet-table or the tea-table of some learned lady friend. Or, finally,\nwhat certainly is best of all, and I specially advise it, he can review\nit.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nAnd now that I have allowed myself the jest to which in this two-sided\nlife hardly any page can be too serious to grant a place, I part with the\nbook with deep seriousness, in the sure hope that sooner or later it will\nreach those to whom alone it can be addressed; and for the rest, patiently\nresigned that the same fate should, in full measure, befall it, that in\nall ages has, to some extent, befallen all knowledge, and especially the\nweightiest knowledge of the truth, to which only a brief triumph is\nallotted between the two long periods in which it is condemned as\nparadoxical or disparaged as trivial. The former fate is also wont to\nbefall its author. But life is short, and truth works far and lives long:\nlet us speak the truth.\n_Written at Dresden in August 1818._\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\nNot to my contemporaries, not to my compatriots\u2014to mankind I commit my now\ncompleted work in the confidence that it will not be without value for\nthem, even if this should be late recognised, as is commonly the lot of\nwhat is good. For it cannot have been for the passing generation,\nengrossed with the delusion of the moment, that my mind, almost against my\nwill, has uninterruptedly stuck to its work through the course of a long\nlife. And while the lapse of time has not been able to make me doubt the\nworth of my work, neither has the lack of sympathy; for I constantly saw\nthe false and the bad, and finally the absurd and senseless,(2) stand in\nuniversal admiration and honour, and I bethought myself that if it were\nnot the case those who are capable of recognising the genuine and right\nare so rare that we may look for them in vain for some twenty years, then\nthose who are capable of producing it could not be so few that their works\nafterwards form an exception to the perishableness of earthly things; and\nthus would be lost the reviving prospect of posterity which every one who\nsets before himself a high aim requires to strengthen him.\nWhoever seriously takes up and pursues an object that does not lead to\nmaterial advantages, must not count on the sympathy of his contemporaries.\nFor the most part he will see, however, that in the meantime the\nsuperficial aspect of that object becomes current in the world, and enjoys\nits day; and this is as it should be. The object itself must be pursued\nfor its own sake, otherwise it cannot be attained; for any design or\nintention is always dangerous to insight. Accordingly, as the whole\nhistory of literature proves, everything of real value required a long\ntime to gain acceptance, especially if it belonged to the class of\ninstructive, not entertaining, works; and meanwhile the false flourished.\nFor to combine the object with its superficial appearance is difficult,\nwhen it is not impossible. Indeed that is just the curse of this world of\nwant and need, that everything must serve and slave for these; and\ntherefore it is not so constituted that any noble and sublime effort, like\nthe endeavour after light and truth, can prosper unhindered and exist for\nits own sake. But even if such an endeavour has once succeeded in\nasserting itself, and the conception of it has thus been introduced,\nmaterial interests and personal aims will immediately take possession of\nit, in order to make it their tool or their mask. Accordingly, when Kant\nbrought philosophy again into repute, it had soon to become the tool of\npolitical aims from above, and personal aims from below; although,\nstrictly speaking, not philosophy itself, but its ghost, that passes for\nit. This should not really astonish us; for the incredibly large majority\nof men are by nature quite incapable of any but material aims, indeed they\ncan conceive no others. Thus the pursuit of truth alone is far too lofty\nand eccentric an endeavour for us to expect all or many, or indeed even a\nfew, faithfully to take part in. If yet we see, as for example at present\nin Germany, a remarkable activity, a general moving, writing, and talking\nwith reference to philosophical subjects, we may confidently assume that,\nin spite of solemn looks and assurances, only real, not ideal aims, are\nthe actual _primum mobile_, the concealed motive of such a movement; that\nit is personal, official, ecclesiastical, political, in short, material\nends that are really kept in view, and consequently that mere party ends\nset the pens of so many pretended philosophers in such rapid motion. Thus\nsome design or intention, not the desire of insight, is the guiding star\nof these disturbers of the peace, and truth is certainly the last thing\nthat is thought of in the matter. It finds no partisans; rather, it may\npursue its way as silently and unheeded through such a philosophical riot\nas through the winter night of the darkest century bound in the rigid\nfaith of the church, when it was communicated only to a few alchemists as\nesoteric learning, or entrusted it may be only to the parchment. Indeed I\nmight say that no time can be more unfavourable to philosophy than that in\nwhich it is shamefully misused, on the one hand to further political\nobjects, on the other as a means of livelihood. Or is it believed that\nsomehow, with such effort and such a turmoil, the truth, at which it by no\nmeans aims, will also be brought to light? Truth is no prostitute, that\nthrows herself away upon those who do not desire her; she is rather so coy\na beauty that he who sacrifices everything to her cannot even then be sure\nof her favour.\nIf Governments make philosophy a means of furthering political ends,\nlearned men see in philosophical professorships a trade that nourishes the\nouter man just like any other; therefore they crowd after them in the\nassurance of their good intentions, that is, the purpose of subserving\nthese ends. And they keep their word: not truth, not clearness, not Plato,\nnot Aristotle, but the ends they were appointed to serve are their guiding\nstar, and become at once the criterion of what is true, valuable, and to\nbe respected, and of the opposites of these. Whatever, therefore, does not\nanswer these ends, even if it were the most important and extraordinary\nthings in their department, is either condemned, or, when this seems\nhazardous, suppressed by being unanimously ignored. Look only at their\nzeal against pantheism; will any simpleton believe that it proceeds from\nconviction? And, in general, how is it possible that philosophy, degraded\nto the position of a means of making one\u2019s bread, can fail to degenerate\ninto sophistry? Just because this is infallibly the case, and the rule, \u201cI\nsing the song of him whose bread I eat,\u201d has always held good, the making\nof money by philosophy was regarded by the ancients as the characteristic\nof the sophists. But we have still to add this, that since throughout this\nworld nothing is to be expected, can be demanded, or is to be had for gold\nbut mediocrity, we must be contented with it here also. Consequently we\nsee in all the German universities the cherished mediocrity striving to\nproduce the philosophy which as yet is not there to produce, at its own\nexpense and indeed in accordance with a predetermined standard and aim, a\nspectacle at which it would be almost cruel to mock.\nWhile thus philosophy has long been obliged to serve entirely as a means\nto public ends on the one side and private ends on the other, I have\npursued the course of my thought, undisturbed by them, for more than\nthirty years, and simply because I was obliged to do so and could not help\nmyself, from an instinctive impulse, which was, however, supported by the\nconfidence that anything true one may have thought, and anything obscure\none may have thrown light upon, will appeal to any thinking mind, no\nmatter when it comprehends it, and will rejoice and comfort it. To such an\none we speak as those who are like us have spoken to us, and have so\nbecome our comfort in the wilderness of this life. Meanwhile the object is\npursued on its own account and for its own sake. Now it happens curiously\nenough with philosophical meditations, that precisely that which one has\nthought out and investigated for oneself, is afterwards of benefit to\nothers; not that, however, which was originally intended for others. The\nformer is confessedly nearest in character to perfect honesty; for a man\ndoes not seek to deceive himself, nor does he offer himself empty husks;\nso that all sophistication and all mere talk is omitted, and consequently\nevery sentence that is written at once repays the trouble of reading it.\nThus my writings bear the stamp of honesty and openness so distinctly on\nthe face of them, that by this alone they are a glaring contrast to those\nof three celebrated sophists of the post-Kantian period. I am always to be\nfound at the standpoint of _reflection_, _i.e._, rational deliberation and\nhonest statement, never at that of _inspiration_, called intellectual\nintuition, or absolute thought; though, if it received its proper name, it\nwould be called empty bombast and charlatanism. Working then in this\nspirit, and always seeing the false and bad in universal acceptance, yea,\nbombast(3) and charlatanism(4) in the highest honour, I have long\nrenounced the approbation of my contemporaries. It is impossible that an\nage which for twenty years has applauded a Hegel, that intellectual\nCaliban, as the greatest of the philosophers, so loudly that it echoes\nthrough the whole of Europe, could make him who has looked on at that\ndesirous of its approbation. It has no more crowns of honour to bestow;\nits applause is prostituted, and its censure has no significance. That I\nmean what I say is attested by the fact that if I had in any way sought\nthe approbation of my contemporaries, I would have had to strike out a\nscore of passages which entirely contradict all their opinions, and indeed\nmust in part be offensive to them. But I would count it a crime to\nsacrifice a single syllable to that approbation. My guiding star has, in\nall seriousness, been truth. Following it, I could first aspire only to my\nown approbation, entirely averted from an age deeply degraded as regards\nall higher intellectual efforts, and a national literature demoralised\neven to the exceptions, a literature in which the art of combining lofty\nwords with paltry significance has reached its height. I can certainly\nnever escape from the errors and weaknesses which, in my case as in every\none else\u2019s, necessarily belong to my nature; but I will not increase them\nby unworthy accommodations.\nAs regards this second edition, first of all I am glad to say that after\nfive and twenty years I find nothing to retract; so that my fundamental\nconvictions have only been confirmed, as far as concerns myself at least.\nThe alterations in the first volume therefore, which contains the whole\ntext of the first edition, nowhere touch what is essential. Sometimes they\nconcern things of merely secondary importance, and more often consist of\nvery short explanatory additions inserted here and there. Only the\ncriticism of the Kantian philosophy has received important corrections and\nlarge additions, for these could not be put into a supplementary book,\nsuch as those which are given in the second volume, and which correspond\nto each of the four books that contain the exposition of my own doctrine.\nIn the case of the latter, I have chosen this form of enlarging and\nimproving them, because the five and twenty years that have passed since\nthey were composed have produced so marked a change in my method of\nexposition and in my style, that it would not have done to combine the\ncontent of the second volume with that of the first, as both must have\nsuffered by the fusion. I therefore give both works separately, and in the\nearlier exposition, even in many places where I would now express myself\nquite differently, I have changed nothing, because I desired to guard\nagainst spoiling the work of my earlier years through the carping\ncriticism of age. What in this regard might need correction will correct\nitself in the mind of the reader with the help of the second volume. Both\nvolumes have, in the full sense of the word, a supplementary relation to\neach other, so far as this rests on the fact that one age of human life\nis, intellectually, the supplement of another. It will therefore be found,\nnot only that each volume contains what the other lacks, but that the\nmerits of the one consist peculiarly in that which is wanting in the\nother. Thus, if the first half of my work surpasses the second in what can\nonly be supplied by the fire of youth and the energy of first conceptions,\nthe second will surpass the first by the ripeness and complete elaboration\nof the thought which can only belong to the fruit of the labour of a long\nlife. For when I had the strength originally to grasp the fundamental\nthought of my system, to follow it at once into its four branches, to\nreturn from them to the unity of their origin, and then to explain the\nwhole distinctly, I could not yet be in a position to work out all the\nbranches of the system with the fulness, thoroughness, and elaborateness\nwhich is only reached by the meditation of many years\u2014meditation which is\nrequired to test and illustrate the system by innumerable facts, to\nsupport it by the most different kinds of proof, to throw light on it from\nall sides, and then to place the different points of view boldly in\ncontrast, to separate thoroughly the multifarious materials, and present\nthem in a well-arranged whole. Therefore, although it would, no doubt,\nhave been more agreeable to the reader to have my whole work in one piece,\ninstead of consisting, as it now does, of two halves, which must be\ncombined in using them, he must reflect that this would have demanded that\nI should accomplish at one period of life what it is only possible to\naccomplish in two, for I would have had to possess the qualities at one\nperiod of life that nature has divided between two quite different ones.\nHence the necessity of presenting my work in two halves supplementary to\neach other may be compared to the necessity in consequence of which a\nchromatic object-glass, which cannot be made out of one piece, is produced\nby joining together a convex lens of flint glass and a concave lens of\ncrown glass, the combined effect of which is what was sought. Yet, on the\nother hand, the reader will find some compensation for the inconvenience\nof using two volumes at once, in the variety and the relief which is\nafforded by the handling of the same subject, by the same mind, in the\nsame spirit, but in very different years. However, it is very advisable\nthat those who are not yet acquainted with my philosophy should first of\nall read the first volume without using the supplementary books, and\nshould make use of these only on a second perusal; otherwise it would be\ntoo difficult for them to grasp the system in its connection. For it is\nonly thus explained in the first volume, while the second is devoted to a\nmore detailed investigation and a complete development of the individual\ndoctrines. Even those who should not make up their minds to a second\nreading of the first volume had better not read the second volume till\nafter the first, and then for itself, in the ordinary sequence of its\nchapters, which, at any rate, stand in some kind of connection, though a\nsomewhat looser one, the gaps of which they will fully supply by the\nrecollection of the first volume, if they have thoroughly comprehended it.\nBesides, they will find everywhere the reference to the corresponding\npassages of the first volume, the paragraphs of which I have numbered in\nthe second edition for this purpose, though in the first edition they were\nonly divided by lines.\nI have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my\nphilosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a\nthorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant\u2019s teaching produces\nin the mind of every one who has comprehended it a fundamental change\nwhich is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It\nalone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the\noriginal character of the intellect, which neither Berkeley nor\nMalebranche succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal,\nwhile Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite\nunexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and,\nwe might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it\nundergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in\nanother light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more\npositive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has\nnot mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied,\nis, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the\ngrasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and\nwhich fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of\nphilosophy. Such a man then stands to the man who knows the Kantian\nphilosophy as a minor to a man of full age. That this truth should\nnowadays sound paradoxical, which would not have been the case in the\nfirst thirty years after the appearance of the Critique of Reason, is due\nto the fact that a generation has grown up that does not know Kant\nproperly, because it has never heard more of him than a hasty, impatient\nlecture, or an account at second-hand; and this again is due to the fact\nthat in consequence of bad guidance, this generation has wasted its time\nwith the philosophemes of vulgar, uncalled men, or even of bombastic\nsophists, which are unwarrantably commended to it. Hence the confusion of\nfundamental conceptions, and in general the unspeakable crudeness and\nawkwardness that appears from under the covering of affectation and\npretentiousness in the philosophical attempts of the generation thus\nbrought up. But whoever thinks he can learn Kant\u2019s philosophy from the\nexposition of others makes a terrible mistake. Nay, rather I must\nearnestly warn against such accounts, especially the more recent ones; and\nindeed in the years just past I have met with expositions of the Kantian\nphilosophy in the writings of the Hegelians which actually reach the\nincredible. How should the minds that in the freshness of youth have been\nstrained and ruined by the nonsense of Hegelism, be still capable of\nfollowing Kant\u2019s profound investigations? They are early accustomed to\ntake the hollowest jingle of words for philosophical thoughts, the most\nmiserable sophisms for acuteness, and silly conceits for dialectic, and\ntheir minds are disorganised through the admission of mad combinations of\nwords to which the mind torments and exhausts itself in vain to attach\nsome thought. No Critique of Reason can avail them, no philosophy, they\nneed a _medicina mentis_, first as a sort of purgative, _un petit cours de\nsenscommunologie_, and then one must further see whether, in their case,\nthere can even be any talk of philosophy. The Kantian doctrine then will\nbe sought for in vain anywhere else but in Kant\u2019s own works; but these are\nthroughout instructive, even where he errs, even where he fails. In\nconsequence of his originality, it holds good of him in the highest\ndegree, as indeed of all true philosophers, that one can only come to know\nthem from their own works, not from the accounts of others. For the\nthoughts of any extraordinary intellect cannot stand being filtered\nthrough the vulgar mind. Born behind the broad, high, finely-arched brow,\nfrom under which shine beaming eyes, they lose all power and life, and\nappear no longer like themselves, when removed to the narrow lodging and\nlow roofing of the confined, contracted, thick-walled skull from which\ndull glances steal directed to personal ends. Indeed we may say that minds\nof this kind act like an uneven glass, in which everything is twisted and\ndistorted, loses the regularity of its beauty, and becomes a caricature.\nOnly from their authors themselves can we receive philosophical thoughts;\ntherefore whoever feels himself drawn to philosophy must himself seek out\nits immortal teachers in the still sanctuary of their works. The principal\nchapters of any one of these true philosophers will afford a thousand\ntimes more insight into their doctrines than the heavy and distorted\naccounts of them that everyday men produce, who are still for the most\npart deeply entangled in the fashionable philosophy of the time, or in the\nsentiments of their own minds. But it is astonishing how decidedly the\npublic seizes by preference on these expositions at second-hand. It seems\nreally as if elective affinities were at work here, by virtue of which the\ncommon nature is drawn to its like, and therefore will rather hear what a\ngreat man has said from one of its own kind. Perhaps this rests on the\nsame principle as that of mutual instruction, according to which children\nlearn best from children.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOne word more for the professors of philosophy. I have always been\ncompelled to admire not merely the sagacity, the true and fine tact with\nwhich, immediately on its appearance, they recognised my philosophy as\nsomething altogether different from and indeed dangerous to their own\nattempts, or, in popular language, something that would not suit their\nturn; but also the sure and astute policy by virtue of which they at once\ndiscovered the proper procedure with regard to it, the complete harmony\nwith which they applied it, and the persistency with which they have\nremained faithful to it. This procedure, which further commended itself by\nthe great ease of carrying it out, consists, as is well known, in\naltogether ignoring and thus in secreting\u2014according to Goethe\u2019s malicious\nphrase, which just means the appropriating of what is of weight and\nsignificance. The efficiency of this quiet means is increased by the\nCorybantic shouts with which those who are at one reciprocally greet the\nbirth of their own spiritual children\u2014shouts which compel the public to\nlook and note the air of importance with which they congratulate\nthemselves on the event. Who can mistake the object of such proceedings?\nIs there then nothing to oppose to the maxim, _primum vivere, deinde\nphilosophari_? These gentlemen desire to live, and indeed to live by\nphilosophy. To philosophy they are assigned with their wives and children,\nand in spite of Petrarch\u2019s _povera e nuda vai filosofia_, they have staked\neverything upon it. Now my philosophy is by no means so constituted that\nany one can live by it. It lacks the first indispensable requisite of a\nwell-paid professional philosophy, a speculative theology, which\u2014in spite\nof the troublesome Kant with his Critique of Reason\u2014should and must, it is\nsupposed, be the chief theme of all philosophy, even if it thus takes on\nitself the task of talking straight on of that of which it can know\nabsolutely nothing. Indeed my philosophy does not permit to the professors\nthe fiction they have so cunningly devised, and which has become so\nindispensable to them, of a reason that knows, perceives, or apprehends\nimmediately and absolutely. This is a doctrine which it is only necessary\nto impose upon the reader at starting, in order to pass in the most\ncomfortable manner in the world, as it were in a chariot and four, into\nthat region beyond the possibility of all experience, which Kant has\nwholly and for ever shut out from our knowledge, and in which are found\nimmediately revealed and most beautifully arranged the fundamental dogmas\nof modern, Judaising, optimistic Christianity. Now what in the world has\nmy subtle philosophy, deficient as it is in these essential requisites,\nwith no intentional aim, and unable to afford a means of subsistence,\nwhose pole star is truth alone the naked, unrewarded, unbefriended, often\npersecuted truth, and which steers straight for it without looking to the\nright hand or the left,\u2014what, I say, has this to do with that _alma\nmater_, the good, well-to-do university philosophy which, burdened with a\nhundred aims and a thousand motives, comes on its course cautiously\ntacking, while it keeps before its eyes at all times the fear of the Lord,\nthe will of the ministry, the laws of the established church, the wishes\nof the publisher, the attendance of the students, the goodwill of\ncolleagues, the course of current politics, the momentary tendency of the\npublic, and Heaven knows what besides? Or what has my quiet, earnest\nsearch for truth in common with the noisy scholastic disputations of the\nchair and the benches, the inmost motives of which are always personal\naims. The two kinds of philosophy are, indeed, radically different. Thus\nit is that with me there is no compromise and no fellowship, that no one\nreaps any benefit from my works but the man who seeks the truth alone, and\ntherefore none of the philosophical parties of the day; for they all\nfollow their own aims, while I have only insight into truth to offer,\nwhich suits none of these aims, because it is not modelled after any of\nthem. If my philosophy is to become susceptible of professorial\nexposition, the times must entirely change. What a pretty thing it would\nbe if a philosophy by which nobody could live were to gain for itself\nlight and air, not to speak of the general ear! This must be guarded\nagainst, and all must oppose it as one man. But it is not just such an\neasy game to controvert and refute; and, moreover, these are mistaken\nmeans to employ, because they just direct the attention of the public to\nthe matter, and its taste for the lucubrations of the professors of\nphilosophy might be destroyed by the perusal of my writings. For whoever\nhas tasted of earnest will not relish jest, especially when it is\ntiresome. Therefore the silent system, so unanimously adopted, is the only\nright one, and I can only advise them to stick to it and go on with it as\nlong as it will answer, that is, until to ignore is taken to imply\nignorance; then there will just be time to turn back. Meanwhile it remains\nopen to every one to pluck out a small feather here and there for his own\nuse, for the superfluity of thoughts at home should not be very\noppressive. Thus the ignoring and silent system may hold out a good while,\nat least the span of time I may have yet to live, whereby much is already\nwon. And if, in the meantime, here and there an indiscreet voice has let\nitself be heard, it is soon drowned by the loud talking of the professors,\nwho, with important airs, know how to entertain the public with very\ndifferent things. I advise, however, that the unanimity of procedure\nshould be somewhat more strictly observed, and especially that the young\nmen should be looked after, for they are sometimes so fearfully\nindiscreet. For even so I cannot guarantee that the commended procedure\nwill last for ever, and cannot answer for the final issue. It is a nice\nquestion as to the steering of the public, which, on the whole, is good\nand tractable. Although we nearly at all times see the Gorgiases and the\nHippiases uppermost, although the absurd, as a rule, predominates, and it\nseems impossible that the voice of the individual can ever penetrate\nthrough the chorus of the befooling and the befooled, there yet remains to\nthe genuine works of every age a quite peculiar, silent, slow, and\npowerful influence; and, as if by a miracle, we see them rise at last out\nof the turmoil like a balloon that floats up out of the thick atmosphere\nof this globe into purer regions, where, having once arrived, it remains\nat rest, and no one can draw it down again.\n_Written at Frankfort-on-the-Maine in February 1844._\nFIRST BOOK. THE WORLD AS IDEA.\nFirst Aspect. The Idea Subordinated To The Principle Of Sufficient Reason:\nThe Object Of Experience And Science.\nSors de l\u2019enfance, ami r\u00e9veille toi!\n\u2014_Jean Jacques Rousseau._\n\u00a7 1. \u201cThe world is my idea:\u201d\u2014this is a truth which holds good for\neverything that lives and knows, though man alone can bring it into\nreflective and abstract consciousness. If he really does this, he has\nattained to philosophical wisdom. It then becomes clear and certain to him\nthat what he knows is not a sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a\nsun, a hand that feels an earth; that the world which surrounds him is\nthere only as idea, _i.e._, only in relation to something else, the\nconsciousness, which is himself. If any truth can be asserted _a priori_,\nit is this: for it is the expression of the most general form of all\npossible and thinkable experience: a form which is more general than time,\nor space, or causality, for they all presuppose it; and each of these,\nwhich we have seen to be just so many modes of the principle of sufficient\nreason, is valid only for a particular class of ideas; whereas the\nantithesis of object and subject is the common form of all these classes,\nis that form under which alone any idea of whatever kind it may be,\nabstract or intuitive, pure or empirical, is possible and thinkable. No\ntruth therefore is more certain, more independent of all others, and less\nin need of proof than this, that all that exists for knowledge, and\ntherefore this whole world, is only object in relation to subject,\nperception of a perceiver, in a word, idea. This is obviously true of the\npast and the future, as well as of the present, of what is farthest off,\nas of what is near; for it is true of time and space themselves, in which\nalone these distinctions arise. All that in any way belongs or can belong\nto the world is inevitably thus conditioned through the subject, and\nexists only for the subject. The world is idea.\nThis truth is by no means new. It was implicitly involved in the sceptical\nreflections from which Descartes started. Berkeley, however, was the first\nwho distinctly enunciated it, and by this he has rendered a permanent\nservice to philosophy, even though the rest of his teaching should not\nendure. Kant\u2019s primary mistake was the neglect of this principle, as is\nshown in the appendix. How early again this truth was recognised by the\nwise men of India, appearing indeed as the fundamental tenet of the\nVed\u00e2nta philosophy ascribed to Vyasa, is pointed out by Sir William Jones\nin the last of his essays: \u201cOn the philosophy of the Asiatics\u201d (Asiatic\nResearches, vol. iv. p. 164), where he says, \u201cThe fundamental tenet of the\nVedanta school consisted not in denying the existence of matter, that is,\nof solidity, impenetrability, and extended figure (to deny which would be\nlunacy), but in correcting the popular notion of it, and in contending\nthat it has no essence independent of mental perception; that existence\nand perceptibility are convertible terms.\u201d These words adequately express\nthe compatibility of empirical reality and transcendental ideality.\nIn this first book, then, we consider the world only from this side, only\nso far as it is idea. The inward reluctance with which any one accepts the\nworld as merely his idea, warns him that this view of it, however true it\nmay be, is nevertheless one-sided, adopted in consequence of some\narbitrary abstraction. And yet it is a conception from which he can never\nfree himself. The defectiveness of this view will be corrected in the next\nbook by means of a truth which is not so immediately certain as that from\nwhich we start here; a truth at which we can arrive only by deeper\nresearch and more severe abstraction, by the separation of what is\ndifferent and the union of what is identical. This truth, which must be\nvery serious and impressive if not awful to every one, is that a man can\nalso say and must say, \u201cthe world is my will.\u201d\nIn this book, however, we must consider separately that aspect of the\nworld from which we start, its aspect as knowable, and therefore, in the\nmeantime, we must, without reserve, regard all presented objects, even our\nown bodies (as we shall presently show more fully), merely as ideas, and\ncall them merely ideas. By so doing we always abstract from will (as we\nhope to make clear to every one further on), which by itself constitutes\nthe other aspect of the world. For as the world is in one aspect entirely\n_idea_, so in another it is entirely _will_. A reality which is neither of\nthese two, but an object in itself (into which the thing in itself has\nunfortunately dwindled in the hands of Kant), is the phantom of a dream,\nand its acceptance is an _ignis fatuus_ in philosophy.\n\u00a7 2. That which knows all things and is known by none is the subject. Thus\nit is the supporter of the world, that condition of all phenomena, of all\nobjects which is always pre-supposed throughout experience; for all that\nexists, exists only for the subject. Every one finds himself to be\nsubject, yet only in so far as he knows, not in so far as he is an object\nof knowledge. But his body is object, and therefore from this point of\nview we call it idea. For the body is an object among objects, and is\nconditioned by the laws of objects, although it is an immediate object.\nLike all objects of perception, it lies within the universal forms of\nknowledge, time and space, which are the conditions of multiplicity. The\nsubject, on the contrary, which is always the knower, never the known,\ndoes not come under these forms, but is presupposed by them; it has\ntherefore neither multiplicity nor its opposite unity. We never know it,\nbut it is always the knower wherever there is knowledge.\nSo then the world as idea, the only aspect in which we consider it at\npresent, has two fundamental, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one\nhalf is the object, the forms of which are space and time, and through\nthese multiplicity. The other half is the subject, which is not in space\nand time, for it is present, entire and undivided, in every percipient\nbeing. So that any one percipient being, with the object, constitutes the\nwhole world as idea just as fully as the existing millions could do; but\nif this one were to disappear, then the whole world as idea would cease to\nbe. These halves are therefore inseparable even for thought, for each of\nthe two has meaning and existence only through and for the other, each\nappears with the other and vanishes with it. They limit each other\nimmediately; where the object begins the subject ends. The universality of\nthis limitation is shown by the fact that the essential and hence\nuniversal forms of all objects, space, time, and causality, may, without\nknowledge of the object, be discovered and fully known from a\nconsideration of the subject, _i.e._, in Kantian language, they lie _a\npriori_ in our consciousness. That he discovered this is one of Kant\u2019s\nprincipal merits, and it is a great one. I however go beyond this, and\nmaintain that the principle of sufficient reason is the general expression\nfor all these forms of the object of which we are _a priori_ conscious;\nand that therefore all that we know purely _a priori_, is merely the\ncontent of that principle and what follows from it; in it all our certain\n_a priori_ knowledge is expressed. In my essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason I have shown in detail how every possible object comes\nunder it; that is, stands in a necessary relation to other objects, on the\none side as determined, on the other side as determining: this is of such\nwide application, that the whole existence of all objects, so far as they\nare objects, ideas and nothing more, may be entirely traced to this their\nnecessary relation to each other, rests only in it, is in fact merely\nrelative; but of this more presently. I have further shown, that the\nnecessary relation which the principle of sufficient reason expresses\ngenerally, appears in other forms corresponding to the classes into which\nobjects are divided, according to their possibility; and again that by\nthese forms the proper division of the classes is tested. I take it for\ngranted that what I said in this earlier essay is known and present to the\nreader, for if it had not been already said it would necessarily find its\nplace here.\n\u00a7 3. The chief distinction among our ideas is that between ideas of\nperception and abstract ideas. The latter form just one class of ideas,\nnamely concepts, and these are the possession of man alone of all\ncreatures upon earth. The capacity for these, which distinguishes him from\nall the lower animals, has always been called reason.(5) We shall consider\nthese abstract ideas by themselves later, but, in the first place, we\nshall speak exclusively of the _ideas of perception_. These comprehend the\nwhole visible world, or the sum total of experience, with the conditions\nof its possibility. We have already observed that it is a highly important\ndiscovery of Kant\u2019s, that these very conditions, these forms of the\nvisible world, _i.e._, the absolutely universal element in its perception,\nthe common property of all its phenomena, space and time, even when taken\nby themselves and apart from their content, can, not only be thought in\nthe abstract, but also be directly perceived; and that this perception or\nintuition is not some kind of phantasm arising from constant recurrence in\nexperience, but is so entirely independent of experience that we must\nrather regard the latter as dependent on it, inasmuch as the qualities of\nspace and time, as they are known in _a priori_ perception or intuition,\nare valid for all possible experience, as rules to which it must\ninvariably conform. Accordingly, in my essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, I have treated space and time, because they are\nperceived as pure and empty of content, as a special and independent class\nof ideas. This quality of the universal forms of intuition, which was\ndiscovered by Kant, that they may be perceived in themselves and apart\nfrom experience, and that they may be known as exhibiting those laws on\nwhich is founded the infallible science of mathematics, is certainly very\nimportant. Not less worthy of remark, however, is this other quality of\ntime and space, that the principle of sufficient reason, which conditions\nexperience as the law of causation and of motive, and thought as the law\nof the basis of judgment, appears here in quite a special form, to which I\nhave given the name of the ground of being. In time, this is the\nsuccession of its moments, and in space the position of its parts, which\nreciprocally determine each other _ad infinitum_.\nAny one who has fully understood from the introductory essay the complete\nidentity of the content of the principle of sufficient reason in all its\ndifferent forms, must also be convinced of the importance of the knowledge\nof the simplest of these forms, as affording him insight into his own\ninmost nature. This simplest form of the principle we have found to be\ntime. In it each instant is, only in so far as it has effaced the\npreceding one, its generator, to be itself in turn as quickly effaced. The\npast and the future (considered apart from the consequences of their\ncontent) are empty as a dream, and the present is only the indivisible and\nunenduring boundary between them. And in all the other forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, we shall find the same emptiness, and\nshall see that not time only but also space, and the whole content of both\nof them, _i.e._, all that proceeds from causes and motives, has a merely\nrelative existence, is only through and for another like to itself,\n_i.e._, not more enduring. The substance of this doctrine is old: it\nappears in Heraclitus when he laments the eternal flux of things; in Plato\nwhen he degrades the object to that which is ever becoming, but never\nbeing; in Spinoza as the doctrine of the mere accidents of the one\nsubstance which is and endures. Kant opposes what is thus known as the\nmere phenomenon to the thing in itself. Lastly, the ancient wisdom of the\nIndian philosophers declares, \u201cIt is M\u00e2y\u00e2, the veil of deception, which\nblinds the eyes of mortals, and makes them behold a world of which they\ncannot say either that it is or that it is not: for it is like a dream; it\nis like the sunshine on the sand which the traveller takes from afar for\nwater, or the stray piece of rope he mistakes for a snake.\u201d (These similes\nare repeated in innumerable passages of the Vedas and the Puranas.) But\nwhat all these mean, and that of which they all speak, is nothing more\nthan what we have just considered\u2014the world as idea subject to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason.\n\u00a7 4. Whoever has recognised the form of the principle of sufficient\nreason, which appears in pure time as such, and on which all counting and\narithmetical calculation rests, has completely mastered the nature of\ntime. Time is nothing more than that form of the principle of sufficient\nreason, and has no further significance. Succession is the form of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in time, and succession is the whole nature\nof time. Further, whoever has recognised the principle of sufficient\nreason as it appears in the presentation of pure space, has exhausted the\nwhole nature of space, which is absolutely nothing more than that\npossibility of the reciprocal determination of its parts by each other,\nwhich is called position. The detailed treatment of this, and the\nformulation in abstract conceptions of the results which flow from it, so\nthat they may be more conveniently used, is the subject of the science of\ngeometry. Thus also, whoever has recognised the law of causation, the\naspect of the principle of sufficient reason which appears in what fills\nthese forms (space and time) as objects of perception, that is to say\nmatter, has completely mastered the nature of matter as such, for matter\nis nothing more than causation, as any one will see at once if he\nreflects. Its true being is its action, nor can we possibly conceive it as\nhaving any other meaning. Only as active does it fill space and time; its\naction upon the immediate object (which is itself matter) determines that\nperception in which alone it exists. The consequence of the action of any\nmaterial object upon any other, is known only in so far as the latter acts\nupon the immediate object in a different way from that in which it acted\nbefore; it consists only of this. Cause and effect thus constitute the\nwhole nature of matter; its true being is its action. (A fuller treatment\nof this will be found in the essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\n\u00a7 21, p. 77.) The nature of all material things is therefore very\nappropriately called in German _Wirklichkeit_,(6) a word which is far more\nexpressive than _Realit\u00e4t_. Again, that which is acted upon is always\nmatter, and thus the whole being and essence of matter consists in the\norderly change, which one part of it brings about in another part. The\nexistence of matter is therefore entirely relative, according to a\nrelation which is valid only within its limits, as in the case of time and\nspace.\nBut time and space, each for itself, can be mentally presented apart from\nmatter, whereas matter cannot be so presented apart from time and space.\nThe form which is inseparable from it presupposes space, and the action in\nwhich its very existence consists, always imports some change, in other\nwords a determination in time. But space and time are not only, each for\nitself, presupposed by matter, but a union of the two constitutes its\nessence, for this, as we have seen, consists in action, _i.e._, in\ncausation. All the innumerable conceivable phenomena and conditions of\nthings, might be coexistent in boundless space, without limiting each\nother, or might be successive in endless time without interfering with\neach other: thus a necessary relation of these phenomena to each other,\nand a law which should regulate them according to such a relation, is by\nno means needful, would not, indeed, be applicable: it therefore follows\nthat in the case of all co-existence in space and change in time, so long\nas each of these forms preserves for itself its condition and its course\nwithout any connection with the other, there can be no causation, and\nsince causation constitutes the essential nature of matter, there can be\nno matter. But the law of causation receives its meaning and necessity\nonly from this, that the essence of change does not consist simply in the\nmere variation of things, but rather in the fact that at the _same part of\nspace_ there is now _one thing_ and then _another_, and at _one_ and the\nsame point of time there is _here_ one thing and there _another_: only\nthis reciprocal limitation of space and time by each other gives meaning,\nand at the same time necessity, to a law, according to which change must\ntake place. What is determined by the law of causality is therefore not\nmerely a succession of things in time, but this succession with reference\nto a definite space, and not merely existence of things in a particular\nplace, but in this place at a different point of time. Change, _i.e._,\nvariation which takes place according to the law of causality, implies\nalways a determined part of space and a determined part of time together\nand in union. Thus causality unites space with time. But we found that the\nwhole essence of matter consisted in action, _i.e._, in causation,\nconsequently space and time must also be united in matter, that is to say,\nmatter must take to itself at once the distinguishing qualities both of\nspace and time, however much these may be opposed to each other, and must\nunite in itself what is impossible for each of these independently, that\nis, the fleeting course of time, with the rigid unchangeable perduration\nof space: infinite divisibility it receives from both. It is for this\nreason that we find that co-existence, which could neither be in time\nalone, for time has no contiguity, nor in space alone, for space has no\nbefore, after, or now, is first established through matter. But the\nco-existence of many things constitutes, in fact, the essence of reality,\nfor through it permanence first becomes possible; for permanence is only\nknowable in the change of something which is present along with what is\npermanent, while on the other hand it is only because something permanent\nis present along with what changes, that the latter gains the special\ncharacter of change, _i.e._, the mutation of quality and form in the\npermanence of substance, that is to say, in matter.(7) If the world were\nin space alone, it would be rigid and immovable, without succession,\nwithout change, without action; but we know that with action, the idea of\nmatter first appears. Again, if the world were in time alone, all would be\nfleeting, without persistence, without contiguity, hence without\nco-existence, and consequently without permanence; so that in this case\nalso there would be no matter. Only through the union of space and time do\nwe reach matter, and matter is the possibility of co-existence, and,\nthrough that, of permanence; through permanence again matter is the\npossibility of the persistence of substance in the change of its\nstates.(8) As matter consists in the union of space and time, it bears\nthroughout the stamp of both. It manifests its origin in space, partly\nthrough the form which is inseparable from it, but especially through its\npersistence (substance), the _a priori_ certainty of which is therefore\nwholly deducible from that of space(9) (for variation belongs to time\nalone, but in it alone and for itself nothing is persistent). Matter shows\nthat it springs from time by quality (accidents), without which it never\nexists, and which is plainly always causality, action upon other matter,\nand therefore change (a time concept). The law of this action, however,\nalways depends upon space and time together, and only thus obtains\nmeaning. The regulative function of causality is confined entirely to the\ndetermination of what must occupy _this time and this space_. The fact\nthat we know _a priori_ the unalterable characteristics of matter, depends\nupon this derivation of its essential nature from the forms of our\nknowledge of which we are conscious _a priori_. These unalterable\ncharacteristics are space-occupation, _i.e._, impenetrability, _i.e._,\ncausal action, consequently, extension, infinite divisibility,\npersistence, _i.e._, indestructibility, and lastly mobility: weight, on\nthe other hand, notwithstanding its universality, must be attributed to _a\nposteriori_ knowledge, although Kant, in his \u201cMetaphysical Introduction to\nNatural Philosophy,\u201d p. 71 (p. 372 of Rosenkranz\u2019s edition), treats it as\nknowable _a priori_.\nBut as the object in general is only for the subject, as its idea, so\nevery special class of ideas is only for an equally special quality in the\nsubject, which is called a faculty of perception. This subjective\ncorrelative of time and space in themselves as empty forms, has been named\nby Kant pure sensibility; and we may retain this expression, as Kant was\nthe first to treat of the subject, though it is not exact, for sensibility\npresupposes matter. The subjective correlative of matter or of causation,\nfor these two are the same, is understanding, which is nothing more than\nthis. To know causality is its one function, its only power; and it is a\ngreat one, embracing much, of manifold application, yet of unmistakable\nidentity in all its manifestations. Conversely all causation, that is to\nsay, all matter, or the whole of reality, is only for the understanding,\nthrough the understanding, and in the understanding. The first, simplest,\nand ever-present example of understanding is the perception of the actual\nworld. This is throughout knowledge of the cause from the effect, and\ntherefore all perception is intellectual. The understanding could never\narrive at this perception, however, if some effect did not become known\nimmediately, and thus serve as a starting-point. But this is the affection\nof the animal body. So far, then, the animal body is the _immediate\nobject_ of the subject; the perception of all other objects becomes\npossible through it. The changes which every animal body experiences, are\nimmediately known, that is, felt; and as these effects are at once\nreferred to their causes, the perception of the latter as _objects_\narises. This relation is no conclusion in abstract conceptions; it does\nnot arise from reflection, nor is it arbitrary, but immediate, necessary,\nand certain. It is the method of knowing of the pure understanding,\nwithout which there could be no perception; there would only remain a dull\nplant-like consciousness of the changes of the immediate object, which\nwould succeed each other in an utterly unmeaning way, except in so far as\nthey might have a meaning for the will either as pain or pleasure. But as\nwith the rising of the sun the visible world appears, so at one stroke,\nthe understanding, by means of its one simple function, changes the dull,\nmeaningless sensation into perception. What the eye, the ear, or the hand\nfeels, is not perception; it is merely its data. By the understanding\npassing from the effect to the cause, the world first appears as\nperception extended in space, varying in respect of form, persistent\nthrough all time in respect of matter; for the understanding unites space\nand time in the idea of matter, that is, causal action. As the world as\nidea exists only through the understanding, so also it exists only for the\nunderstanding. In the first chapter of my essay on \u201cLight and Colour,\u201d I\nhave already explained how the understanding constructs perceptions out of\nthe data supplied by the senses; how by comparison of the impressions\nwhich the various senses receive from the object, a child arrives at\nperceptions; how this alone affords the solution of so many phenomena of\nthe senses; the single vision of two eyes, the double vision in the case\nof a squint, or when we try to look at once at objects which lie at\nunequal distances behind each other; and all illusion which is produced by\na sudden alteration in the organs of sense. But I have treated this\nimportant subject much more fully and thoroughly in the second edition of\nthe essay on \u201cThe Principle of Sufficient Reason,\u201d \u00a7 21. All that is said\nthere would find its proper place here, and would therefore have to be\nsaid again; but as I have almost as much disinclination to quote myself as\nto quote others, and as I am unable to explain the subject better than it\nis explained there, I refer the reader to it, instead of quoting it, and\ntake for granted that it is known.\nThe process by which children, and persons born blind who have been\noperated upon, learn to see, the single vision of the double sensation of\ntwo eyes, the double vision and double touch which occur when the organs\nof sense have been displaced from their usual position, the upright\nappearance of objects while the picture on the retina is upside down, the\nattributing of colour to the outward objects, whereas it is merely an\ninner function, a division through polarisation, of the activity of the\neye, and lastly the stereoscope,\u2014all these are sure and incontrovertible\nevidence that perception is not merely of the senses, but\nintellectual\u2014that is, _pure knowledge through the understanding of the\ncause from the effect_, and that, consequently, it presupposes the law of\ncausality, in a knowledge of which all perception\u2014that is to say all\nexperience, by virtue of its primary and only possibility, depends. The\ncontrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which\nwas the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this. For the independence\nof the knowledge of causality of all experience,\u2014that is, its _a priori_\ncharacter\u2014can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon\nit; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner\nhere indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the\nknowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all\nexperience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely\n_a priori_, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a\ncondition. This, however, cannot be deduced in the manner attempted by\nKant, which I have criticised in the essay on \u201cThe Principle of Sufficient\nReason,\u201d \u00a7 23.\n\u00a7 5. It is needful to guard against the grave error of supposing that\nbecause perception arises through the knowledge of causality, the relation\nof subject and object is that of cause and effect. For this relation\nsubsists only between the immediate object and objects known indirectly,\nthus always between objects alone. It is this false supposition that has\ngiven rise to the foolish controversy about the reality of the outer\nworld; a controversy in which dogmatism and scepticism oppose each other,\nand the former appears, now as realism, now as idealism. Realism treats\nthe object as cause, and the subject as its effect. The idealism of Fichte\nreduces the object to the effect of the subject. Since however, and this\ncannot be too much emphasised, there is absolutely no relation according\nto the principle of sufficient reason between subject and object, neither\nof these views could be proved, and therefore scepticism attacked them\nboth with success. Now, just as the law of causality precedes perception\nand experience as their condition, and therefore cannot (as Hume thought)\nbe derived from them, so object and subject precede all knowledge, and\nhence the principle of sufficient reason in general, as its first\ncondition; for this principle is merely the form of all objects, the whole\nnature and possibility of their existence as phenomena: but the object\nalways presupposes the subject; and therefore between these two there can\nbe no relation of reason and consequent. My essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason accomplishes just this: it explains the content of that\nprinciple as the essential form of every object\u2014that is to say, as the\nuniversal nature of all objective existence, as something which pertains\nto the object as such; but the object as such always presupposes the\nsubject as its necessary correlative; and therefore the subject remains\nalways outside the province in which the principle of sufficient reason is\nvalid. The controversy as to the reality of the outer world rests upon\nthis false extension of the validity of the principle of sufficient reason\nto the subject also, and starting with this mistake it can never\nunderstand itself. On the one side realistic dogmatism, looking upon the\nidea as the effect of the object, desires to separate these two, idea and\nobject, which are really one, and to assume a cause quite different from\nthe idea, an object in itself, independent of the subject, a thing which\nis quite inconceivable; for even as object it presupposes subject, and so\nremains its idea. Opposed to this doctrine is scepticism, which makes the\nsame false presupposition that in the idea we have only the effect, never\nthe cause, therefore never real being; that we always know merely the\naction of the object. But this object, it supposes, may perhaps have no\nresemblance whatever to its effect, may indeed have been quite erroneously\nreceived as the cause, for the law of causality is first to be gathered\nfrom experience, and the reality of experience is then made to rest upon\nit. Thus both of these views are open to the correction, firstly, that\nobject and idea are the same; secondly, that the true being of the object\nof perception is its action, that the reality of the thing consists in\nthis, and the demand for an existence of the object outside the idea of\nthe subject, and also for an essence of the actual thing different from\nits action, has absolutely no meaning, and is a contradiction: and that\nthe knowledge of the nature of the effect of any perceived object,\nexhausts such an object itself, so far as it is object, _i.e._, idea, for\nbeyond this there is nothing more to be known. So far then, the perceived\nworld in space and time, which makes itself known as causation alone, is\nentirely real, and is throughout simply what it appears to be, and it\nappears wholly and without reserve as idea, bound together according to\nthe law of causality. This is its empirical reality. On the other hand,\nall causality is in the understanding alone, and for the understanding.\nThe whole actual, that is, active world is determined as such through the\nunderstanding, and apart from it is nothing. This, however, is not the\nonly reason for altogether denying such a reality of the outer world as is\ntaught by the dogmatist, who explains its reality as its independence of\nthe subject. We also deny it, because no object apart from a subject can\nbe conceived without contradiction. The whole world of objects is and\nremains idea, and therefore wholly and for ever determined by the subject;\nthat is to say, it has transcendental ideality. But it is not therefore\nillusion or mere appearance; it presents itself as that which it is, idea,\nand indeed as a series of ideas of which the common bond is the principle\nof sufficient reason. It is according to its inmost meaning quite\ncomprehensible to the healthy understanding, and speaks a language quite\nintelligible to it. To dispute about its reality can only occur to a mind\nperverted by over-subtilty, and such discussion always arises from a false\napplication of the principle of sufficient reason, which binds all ideas\ntogether of whatever kind they may be, but by no means connects them with\nthe subject, nor yet with a something which is neither subject nor object,\nbut only the ground of the object; an absurdity, for only objects can be\nand always are the ground of objects. If we examine more closely the\nsource of this question as to the reality of the outer world, we find that\nbesides the false application of the principle of sufficient reason\ngenerally to what lies beyond its province, a special confusion of its\nforms is also involved; for that form which it has only in reference to\nconcepts or abstract ideas, is applied to perceived ideas, real objects;\nand a ground of knowing is demanded of objects, whereas they can have\nnothing but a ground of being. Among the abstract ideas, the concepts\nunited in the judgment, the principle of sufficient reason appears in such\na way that each of these has its worth, its validity, and its whole\nexistence, here called _truth_, simply and solely through the relation of\nthe judgment to something outside of it, its ground of knowledge, to which\nthere must consequently always be a return. Among real objects, ideas of\nperception, on the other hand, the principle of sufficient reason appears\nnot as the principle of the ground of _knowing_, but of _being_, as the\nlaw of causality: every real object has paid its debt to it, inasmuch as\nit has come to be, _i.e._, has appeared as the effect of a cause. The\ndemand for a ground of knowing has therefore here no application and no\nmeaning, but belongs to quite another class of things. Thus the world of\nperception raises in the observer no question or doubt so long as he\nremains in contact with it: there is here neither error nor truth, for\nthese are confined to the province of the abstract\u2014the province of\nreflection. But here the world lies open for sense and understanding;\npresents itself with naive truth as that which it really is\u2014ideas of\nperception which develop themselves according to the law of causality.\nSo far as we have considered the question of the reality of the outer\nworld, it arises from a confusion which amounts even to a misunderstanding\nof reason itself, and therefore thus far, the question could be answered\nonly by explaining its meaning. After examination of the whole nature of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, of the relation of subject and object,\nand the special conditions of sense perception, the question itself\ndisappeared because it had no longer any meaning. There is, however, one\nother possible origin of this question, quite different from the purely\nspeculative one which we have considered, a specially empirical origin,\nthough the question is always raised from a speculative point of view, and\nin this form it has a much more comprehensible meaning than it had in the\nfirst. We have dreams; may not our whole life be a dream? or more exactly:\nis there a sure criterion of the distinction between dreams and reality?\nbetween phantasms and real objects? The assertion that what is dreamt is\nless vivid and distinct than what we actually perceive is not to the\npoint, because no one has ever been able to make a fair comparison of the\ntwo; for we can only compare the recollection of a dream with the present\nreality. Kant answers the question thus: \u201cThe connection of ideas among\nthemselves, according to the law of causality, constitutes the difference\nbetween real life and dreams.\u201d But in dreams, as well as in real life,\neverything is connected individually at any rate, in accordance with the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in all its forms, and this connection is\nbroken only between life and dreams, or between one dream and another.\nKant\u2019s answer therefore could only run thus:\u2014the _long_ dream (life) has\nthroughout complete connection according to the principle of sufficient\nreason; it has not this connection, however, with _short_ dreams, although\neach of these has in itself the same connection: the bridge is therefore\nbroken between the former and the latter, and on this account we\ndistinguish them.\nBut to institute an inquiry according to this criterion, as to whether\nsomething was dreamt or seen, would always be difficult and often\nimpossible. For we are by no means in a position to trace link by link the\ncausal connection between any experienced event and the present moment,\nbut we do not on that account explain it as dreamt. Therefore in real life\nwe do not commonly employ that method of distinguishing between dreams and\nreality. The only sure criterion by which to distinguish them is in fact\nthe entirely empirical one of awaking, through which at any rate the\ncausal connection between dreamed events and those of waking life, is\ndistinctly and sensibly broken off. This is strongly supported by the\nremark of Hobbes in the second chapter of Leviathan, that we easily\nmistake dreams for reality if we have unintentionally fallen asleep\nwithout taking off our clothes, and much more so when it also happens that\nsome undertaking or design fills all our thoughts, and occupies our dreams\nas well as our waking moments. We then observe the awaking just as little\nas the falling asleep, dream and reality run together and become\nconfounded. In such a case there is nothing for it but the application of\nKant\u2019s criterion; but if, as often happens, we fail to establish by means\nof this criterion, either the existence of causal connection with the\npresent, or the absence of such connection, then it must for ever remain\nuncertain whether an event was dreamt or really happened. Here, in fact,\nthe intimate relationship between life and dreams is brought out very\nclearly, and we need not be ashamed to confess it, as it has been\nrecognised and spoken of by many great men. The Vedas and Puranas have no\nbetter simile than a dream for the whole knowledge of the actual world,\nwhich they call the web of M\u00e2y\u00e2, and they use none more frequently. Plato\noften says that men live only in a dream; the philosopher alone strives to\nawake himself. Pindar says (ii. \u03b7. 135): \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (umbr\u00e6\nsomnium homo), and Sophocles:\u2014\n\u1f48\u03bd\u03c9 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\n\u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u1fbd \u1f41\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03b6\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd, \u1f74 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6\u03b7\u03bd \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd.\u2014Ajax, 125.\n(Nos enim, quicunque vivimus, nihil aliud esse comperio quam simulacra et\nlevem umbram.) Beside which most worthily stands Shakespeare:\u2014\n\u201cWe are such stuff\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\nIs rounded with a sleep.\u201d\u2014_Tempest_, Act iv. Sc. 1.\nLastly, Calderon was so deeply impressed with this view of life that he\nsought to embody it in a kind of metaphysical drama\u2014\u201cLife a Dream.\u201d\nAfter these numerous quotations from the poets, perhaps I also may be\nallowed to express myself by a metaphor. Life and dreams are leaves of the\nsame book. The systematic reading of this book is real life, but when the\nreading hours (that is, the day) are over, we often continue idly to turn\nover the leaves, and read a page here and there without method or\nconnection: often one we have read before, sometimes one that is new to\nus, but always in the same book. Such an isolated page is indeed out of\nconnection with the systematic study of the book, but it does not seem so\nvery different when we remember that the whole continuous perusal begins\nand ends just as abruptly, and may therefore be regarded as merely a\nlarger single page.\nThus although individual dreams are distinguished from real life by the\nfact that they do not fit into that continuity which runs through the\nwhole of experience, and the act of awaking brings this into\nconsciousness, yet that very continuity of experience belongs to real life\nas its form, and the dream on its part can point to a similar continuity\nin itself. If, therefore, we consider the question from a point of view\nexternal to both, there is no distinct difference in their nature, and we\nare forced to concede to the poets that life is a long dream.\nLet us turn back now from this quite independent empirical origin of the\nquestion of the reality of the outer world, to its speculative origin. We\nfound that this consisted, first, in the false application of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason to the relation of subject and object; and\nsecondly, in the confusion of its forms, inasmuch as the principle of\nsufficient reason of knowing was extended to a province in which the\nprinciple of sufficient reason of being is valid. But the question could\nhardly have occupied philosophers so constantly if it were entirely devoid\nof all real content, and if some true thought and meaning did not lie at\nits heart as its real source. Accordingly, we must assume that when the\nelement of truth that lies at the bottom of the question first came into\nreflection and sought its expression, it became involved in these confused\nand meaningless forms and problems. This at least is my opinion, and I\nthink that the true expression of that inmost meaning of the question,\nwhich it failed to find, is this:\u2014What is this world of perception besides\nbeing my idea? Is that of which I am conscious only as idea, exactly like\nmy own body, of which I am doubly conscious, in one aspect as _idea_, in\nanother aspect as _will_? The fuller explanation of this question and its\nanswer in the affirmative, will form the content of the second book, and\nits consequences will occupy the remaining portion of this work.\n\u00a7 6. For the present, however, in this first book we consider everything\nmerely as idea, as object for the subject. And our own body, which is the\nstarting-point for each of us in our perception of the world, we consider,\nlike all other real objects, from the side of its knowableness, and in\nthis regard it is simply an idea. Now the consciousness of every one is in\ngeneral opposed to the explanation of objects as mere ideas, and more\nespecially to the explanation of our bodies as such; for the thing in\nitself is known to each of us immediately in so far as it appears as our\nown body; but in so far as it objectifies itself in the other objects of\nperception, it is known only indirectly. But this abstraction, this\none-sided treatment, this forcible separation of what is essentially and\nnecessarily united, is only adopted to meet the demands of our argument;\nand therefore the disinclination to it must, in the meantime, be\nsuppressed and silenced by the expectation that the subsequent treatment\nwill correct the one-sidedness of the present one, and complete our\nknowledge of the nature of the world.\nAt present therefore the body is for us immediate object; that is to say,\nthat idea which forms the starting-point of the subject\u2019s knowledge;\nbecause the body, with its immediately known changes, precedes the\napplication of the law of causality, and thus supplies it with its first\ndata. The whole nature of matter consists, as we have seen, in its causal\naction. But cause and effect exist only for the understanding, which is\nnothing but their subjective correlative. The understanding, however,\ncould never come into operation if there were not something else from\nwhich it starts. This is simple sensation\u2014the immediate consciousness of\nthe changes of the body, by virtue of which it is immediate object. Thus\nthe possibility of knowing the world of perception depends upon two\nconditions; the first, _objectively expressed_, is the power of material\nthings to act upon each other, to produce changes in each other, without\nwhich common quality of all bodies no perception would be possible, even\nby means of the sensibility of the animal body. And if we wish to express\nthis condition _subjectively_ we say: The understanding first makes\nperception possible; for the law of causality, the possibility of effect\nand cause, springs only from the understanding, and is valid only for it,\nand therefore the world of perception exists only through and for it. The\nsecond condition is the sensibility of animal bodies, or the quality of\nbeing immediate objects of the subject which certain bodies possess. The\nmere modification which the organs of sense sustain from without through\ntheir specific affections, may here be called ideas, so far as these\naffections produce neither pain nor pleasure, that is, have no immediate\nsignificance for the will, and are yet perceived, exist therefore only for\n_knowledge_. Thus far, then, I say that the body is immediately _known_,\nis _immediate object_. But the conception of object is not to be taken\nhere in its fullest sense, for through this immediate knowledge of the\nbody, which precedes the operation of the understanding, and is mere\nsensation, our own body does not exist specifically as _object_, but first\nthe material things which affect it: for all knowledge of an object\nproper, of an idea perceived in space, exists only through and for the\nunderstanding; therefore not before, but only subsequently to its\noperation. Therefore the body as object proper, that is, as an idea\nperceived in space, is first known indirectly, like all other objects,\nthrough the application of the law of causality to the action of one of\nits parts upon another, as, for example, when the eye sees the body or the\nhand touches it. Consequently the form of our body does not become known\nto us through mere feeling, but only through knowledge, only in idea; that\nis to say, only in the brain does our own body first come to appear as\nextended, articulate, organic. A man born blind receives this idea only\nlittle by little from the data afforded by touch. A blind man without\nhands could never come to know his own form; or at the most could infer\nand construct it little by little from the effects of other bodies upon\nhim. If, then, we call the body an immediate object, we are to be\nunderstood with these reservations.\nIn other respects, then, according to what has been said, all animal\nbodies are immediate objects; that is, starting-points for the subject\nwhich always knows and therefore is never known in its perception of the\nworld. Thus the distinctive characteristic of animal life is knowledge,\nwith movement following on motives, which are determined by knowledge,\njust as movement following on stimuli is the distinctive characteristic of\nplant-life. Unorganised matter, however, has no movement except such as is\nproduced by causes properly so called, using the term in its narrowest\nsense. All this I have thoroughly discussed in my essay on the principle\nof sufficient reason, \u00a7 20, in the \u201cEthics,\u201d first essay, iii., and in my\nwork on Sight and Colour, \u00a7 1, to which I therefore refer.\nIt follows from what has been said, that all animals, even the least\ndeveloped, have understanding; for they all know objects, and this\nknowledge determines their movements as motive. Understanding is the same\nin all animals and in all men; it has everywhere the same simple form;\nknowledge of causality, transition from effect to cause, and from cause to\neffect, nothing more; but the degree of its acuteness, and the extension\nof the sphere of its knowledge varies enormously, with innumerable\ngradations from the lowest form, which is only conscious of the causal\nconnection between the immediate object and objects affecting it\u2014that is\nto say, perceives a cause as an object in space by passing to it from the\naffection which the body feels, to the higher grades of knowledge of the\ncausal connection among objects known indirectly, which extends to the\nunderstanding of the most complicated system of cause and effect in\nnature. For even this high degree of knowledge is still the work of the\nunderstanding, not of the reason. The abstract concepts of the reason can\nonly serve to take up the objective connections which are immediately\nknown by the understanding, to make them permanent for thought, and to\nrelate them to each other; but reason never gives us immediate knowledge.\nEvery force and law of nature, every example of such forces and laws, must\nfirst be immediately known by the understanding, must be apprehended\nthrough perception before it can pass into abstract consciousness for\nreason. Hooke\u2019s discovery of the law of gravitation, and the reference of\nso many important phenomena to this one law, was the work of immediate\napprehension by the understanding; and such also was the proof of Newton\u2019s\ncalculations, and Lavoisier\u2019s discovery of acids and their important\nfunction in nature, and also Goethe\u2019s discovery of the origin of physical\ncolours. All these discoveries are nothing more than a correct immediate\npassage from the effect to the cause, which is at once followed by the\nrecognition of the ideality of the force of nature which expresses itself\nin all causes of the same kind; and this complete insight is just an\nexample of that single function of the understanding, by which an animal\nperceives as an object in space the cause which affects its body, and\ndiffers from such a perception only in degree. Every one of these great\ndiscoveries is therefore, just like perception, an operation of the\nunderstanding, an immediate intuition, and as such the work of an instant,\nan _apper\u00e7u_, a flash of insight. They are not the result of a process of\nabstract reasoning, which only serves to make the immediate knowledge of\nthe understanding permanent for thought by bringing it under abstract\nconcepts, _i.e._, it makes knowledge distinct, it puts us in a position to\nimpart it and explain it to others. The keenness of the understanding in\napprehending the causal relations of objects which are known indirectly,\ndoes not find its only application in the sphere of natural science\n(though all the discoveries in that sphere are due to it), but it also\nappears in practical life. It is then called good sense or prudence, as in\nits other application it is better called acuteness, penetration,\nsagacity. More exactly, good sense or prudence signifies exclusively\nunderstanding at the command of the will. But the limits of these\nconceptions must not be too sharply defined, for it is always that one\nfunction of the understanding by means of which all animals perceive\nobjects in space, which, in its keenest form, appears now in the phenomena\nof nature, correctly inferring the unknown causes from the given effects,\nand providing the material from which the reason frames general rules as\nlaws of nature; now inventing complicated and ingenious machines by\nadapting known causes to desired effects; now in the sphere of motives,\nseeing through and frustrating intrigues and machinations, or fitly\ndisposing the motives and the men who are susceptible to them, setting\nthem in motion, as machines are moved by levers and wheels, and directing\nthem at will to the accomplishment of its ends. Deficiency of\nunderstanding is called _stupidity_. It is just _dulness in applying the\nlaw of causality_, incapacity for the immediate apprehension of the\nconcatenations of causes and effects, motives and actions. A stupid person\nhas no insight into the connection of natural phenomena, either when they\nfollow their own course, or when they are intentionally combined, _i.e._,\nare applied to machinery. Such a man readily believes in magic and\nmiracles. A stupid man does not observe that persons, who apparently act\nindependently of each other, are really in collusion; he is therefore\neasily mystified, and outwitted; he does not discern the hidden motives of\nproffered advice or expressions of opinion, &c. But it is always just one\nthing that he lacks\u2014keenness, rapidity, ease in applying the law of\ncausality, _i.e._, power of understanding. The greatest, and, in this\nreference, the most instructive example of stupidity I ever met with, was\nthe case of a totally imbecile boy of about eleven years of age, in an\nasylum. He had reason, because he spoke and comprehended, but in respect\nof understanding he was inferior to many of the lower animals. Whenever I\nvisited him he noticed an eye-glass which I wore round my neck, and in\nwhich the window of the room and the tops of the trees beyond were\nreflected: on every occasion he was greatly surprised and delighted with\nthis, and was never tired of looking at it with astonishment, because he\ndid not understand the immediate causation of reflection.\nWhile the difference in degree of the acuteness of the understanding, is\nvery great between man and man, it is even greater between one species of\nanimal and another. In all species of animals, even those which are\nnearest to plants, there is at least as much understanding as suffices for\nthe inference from the effect on the immediate object, to the indirectly\nknown object as its cause, _i.e._, sufficient for perception, for the\napprehension of an object. For it is this that constitutes them animals,\nas it gives them the power of movement following on motives, and thereby\nthe power of seeking for food, or at least of seizing it; whereas plants\nhave only movement following on stimuli, whose direct influence they must\nawait, or else decay, for they cannot seek after them nor appropriate\nthem. We marvel at the great sagacity of the most developed species of\nanimals, such as the dog, the elephant, the monkey or the fox, whose\ncleverness has been so admirably sketched by Buffon. From these most\nsagacious animals, we can pretty accurately determine how far\nunderstanding can go without reason, _i.e._, abstract knowledge embodied\nin concepts. We could not find this out from ourselves, for in us\nunderstanding and reason always reciprocally support each other. We find\nthat the manifestation of understanding in animals is sometimes above our\nexpectation, and sometimes below it. On the one hand, we are surprised at\nthe sagacity of the elephant, who, after crossing many bridges during his\njourney in Europe, once refused to go upon one, because he thought it was\nnot strong enough to bear his weight, though he saw the rest of the party,\nconsisting of men and horses, go upon it as usual. On the other hand, we\nwonder that the intelligent Orang-outangs, who warm themselves at a fire\nthey have found, do not keep it alight by throwing wood on it; a proof\nthat this requires a deliberation which is not possible without abstract\nconcepts. It is clear that the knowledge of cause and effect, as the\nuniversal form of understanding, belongs to all animals _a priori_,\nbecause to them as to us it is the prior condition of all perception of\nthe outer world. If any one desires additional proof of this, let him\nobserve, for example, how a young dog is afraid to jump down from a table,\nhowever much he may wish to do so, because he foresees the effect of the\nweight of his body, though he has not been taught this by experience. In\njudging of the understanding of animals, we must guard against ascribing\nto it the manifestations of instinct, a faculty which is quite distinct\nboth from understanding and reason, but the action of which is often very\nanalogous to the combined action of the two. We cannot, however, discuss\nthis here; it will find its proper place in the second book, when we\nconsider the harmony or so-called teleology of nature: and the 27th\nchapter of the supplementary volume is expressly devoted to it.\nDeficiency of _understanding_ we call _stupidity_: deficiency in the\napplication of _reason_ to practice we shall recognise later as\n_foolishness_: deficiency of judgment as _silliness_, and lastly, partial\nor entire deficiency of _memory_ as _madness_. But each of these will be\nconsidered in its own place. That which is correctly known by _reason_ is\n_truth_, that is, an abstract judgment on sufficient grounds (Essay on the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason, \u00a7 29 and following paragraphs); that which\nis correctly known by _understanding_ is _reality_, that is correct\ninference from effect on the immediate object to its cause. _Error_ is\nopposed to _truth_, as deception of the _reason_: _illusion_ is opposed to\n_reality_, as deception of the _understanding_. The full discussion of all\nthis will be found in the first chapter of my essay on Light and Colour.\nIllusion takes place when the same effect may be attributed to two causes,\nof which one occurs very frequently, the other very seldom; the\nunderstanding having no data to decide which of these two causes operates\nin any particular case,\u2014for their effects are exactly alike,\u2014always\nassumes the presence of the commoner cause, and as the activity of the\nunderstanding is not reflective and discursive, but direct and immediate,\nthis false cause appears before us as a perceived object, whereas it is\nmerely illusion. I have explained in the essay referred to, how in this\nway double sight and double feeling take place if the organs of sense are\nbrought into an unusual position; and have thus given an incontrovertible\nproof that perception exists only through and for the understanding. As\nadditional examples of such illusions or deceptions of the understanding,\nwe may mention the broken appearance of a stick dipped in water; the\nreflections in spherical mirrors, which, when the surface is convex appear\nsomewhat behind it, and when the surface is concave appear a long way in\nfront of it. To this class also belongs the apparently greater extension\nof the moon at the horizon than at the zenith. This appearance is not\noptical, for as the micrometre proves, the eye receives the image of the\nmoon at the zenith, at an even greater angle of vision than at the\nhorizon. The mistake is due to the understanding, which assumes that the\ncause of the feebler light of the moon and of all stars at the horizon is\nthat they are further off, thus treating them as earthly objects,\naccording to the laws of atmospheric perspective, and therefore it takes\nthe moon to be much larger at the horizon than at the zenith, and also\nregards the vault of heaven as more extended or flattened out at the\nhorizon. The same false application of the laws of atmospheric perspective\nleads us to suppose that very high mountains, whose summits alone are\nvisible in pure transparent air, are much nearer than they really are, and\ntherefore not so high as they are; for example, Mont Blanc seen from\nSalenche. All such illusions are immediately present to us as perceptions,\nand cannot be dispelled by any arguments of the reason. Reason can only\nprevent error, that is, a judgment on insufficient grounds, by opposing to\nit a truth; as for example, the abstract knowledge that the cause of the\nweaker light of the moon and the stars at the horizon is not greater\ndistance, but the denser atmosphere; but in all the cases we have referred\nto, the illusion remains in spite of every abstract explanation. For the\nunderstanding is in itself, even in the case of man, irrational, and is\ncompletely and sharply distinguished from the reason, which is a faculty\nof knowledge that belongs to man alone. The reason can only _know_;\nperception remains free from its influence and belongs to the\nunderstanding alone.\n\u00a7 7. With reference to our exposition up to this point, it must be\nobserved that we did not start either from the object or the subject, but\nfrom the idea, which contains and presupposes them both; for the\nantithesis of object and subject is its primary, universal and essential\nform. We have therefore first considered this form as such; then (though\nin this respect reference has for the most part been made to the\nintroductory essay) the subordinate forms of time, space and causality.\nThe latter belong exclusively to the _object_, and yet, as they are\nessential to the object _as such_, and as the object again is essential to\nthe subject _as such_, they may be discovered from the subject, _i.e._,\nthey may be known _a priori_, and so far they are to be regarded as the\ncommon limits of both. But all these forms may be referred to one general\nexpression, the principle of sufficient reason, as we have explained in\nthe introductory essay.\nThis procedure distinguishes our philosophical method from that of all\nformer systems. For they all start either from the object or from the\nsubject, and therefore seek to explain the one from the other, and this\naccording to the principle of sufficient reason. We, on the contrary, deny\nthe validity of this principle with reference to the relation of subject\nand object, and confine it to the object. It may be thought that the\nphilosophy of identity, which has appeared and become generally known in\nour own day, does not come under either of the alternatives we have named,\nfor it does not start either from the subject or from the object, but from\nthe absolute, known through \u201cintellectual intuition,\u201d which is neither\nobject nor subject, but the identity of the two. I will not venture to\nspeak of this revered identity, and this absolute, for I find myself\nentirely devoid of all \u201cintellectual intuition.\u201d But as I take my stand\nmerely on those manifestoes of the \u201cintellectual intuiter\u201d which are open\nto all, even to profane persons like myself, I must yet observe that this\nphilosophy is not to be excepted from the alternative errors mentioned\nabove. For it does not escape these two opposite errors in spite of its\nidentity of subject and object, which is not thinkable, but only\n\u201cintellectually intuitable,\u201d or to be experienced by a losing of oneself\nin it. On the contrary, it combines them both in itself; for it is divided\ninto two parts, firstly, transcendental idealism, which is just Fichte\u2019s\ndoctrine of the _ego_, and therefore teaches that the object is produced\nby the subject, or evolved out of it in accordance with the principle of\nsufficient reason; secondly, the philosophy of nature, which teaches that\nthe subject is produced little by little from the object, by means of a\nmethod called construction, about which I understand very little, yet\nenough to know that it is a process according to various forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. The deep wisdom itself which that\nconstruction contains, I renounce; for as I entirely lack \u201cintellectual\nintuition,\u201d all those expositions which presuppose it must for me remain\nas a book sealed with seven seals. This is so truly the case that, strange\nto say, I have always been unable to find anything at all in this doctrine\nof profound wisdom but atrocious and wearisome bombast.\nThe systems starting from the object had always the whole world of\nperception and its constitution as their problem; yet the object which\nthey take as their starting-point is not always this whole world of\nperception, nor its fundamental element, matter. On the contrary, a\ndivision of these systems may be made, based on the four classes of\npossible objects set forth in the introductory essay. Thus Thales and the\nIonic school, Democritus, Epicurus, Giordano Bruno, and the French\nmaterialists, may be said to have started from the first class of objects,\nthe real world: Spinoza (on account of his conception of substance, which\nis purely abstract, and exists only in his definition) and, earlier, the\nEleatics, from the second class, the abstract conception: the Pythagoreans\nand Chinese philosophy in Y-King, from the third class, time, and\nconsequently number: and, lastly, the schoolmen, who teach a creation out\nof nothing by the act of will of an extra-mundane personal being, started\nfrom the fourth class of objects, the act of will directed by knowledge.\nOf all systems of philosophy which start from the object, the most\nconsistent, and that which may be carried furthest, is simple materialism.\nIt regards matter, and with it time and space, as existing absolutely, and\nignores the relation to the subject in which alone all this really exists.\nIt then lays hold of the law of causality as a guiding principle or clue,\nregarding it as a self-existent order (or arrangement) of things, _veritas\naeterna_, and so fails to take account of the understanding, in which and\nfor which alone causality is. It seeks the primary and most simple state\nof matter, and then tries to develop all the others from it; ascending\nfrom mere mechanism, to chemism, to polarity, to the vegetable and to the\nanimal kingdom. And if we suppose this to have been done, the last link in\nthe chain would be animal sensibility\u2014that is knowledge\u2014which would\nconsequently now appear as a mere modification or state of matter produced\nby causality. Now if we had followed materialism thus far with clear\nideas, when we reached its highest point we would suddenly be seized with\na fit of the inextinguishable laughter of the Olympians. As if waking from\na dream, we would all at once become aware that its final\nresult\u2014knowledge, which it reached so laboriously, was presupposed as the\nindispensable condition of its very starting-point, mere matter; and when\nwe imagined that we thought matter, we really thought only the subject\nthat perceives matter; the eye that sees it, the hand that feels it, the\nunderstanding that knows it. Thus the tremendous _petitio principii_\nreveals itself unexpectedly; for suddenly the last link is seen to be the\nstarting-point, the chain a circle, and the materialist is like Baron\nM\u00fcnchausen who, when swimming in water on horseback, drew the horse into\nthe air with his legs, and himself also by his cue. The fundamental\nabsurdity of materialism is that it starts from the _objective_, and takes\nas the ultimate ground of explanation something _objective_, whether it be\nmatter in the abstract, simply as it is _thought_, or after it has taken\nform, is empirically given\u2014that is to say, is _substance_, the chemical\nelement with its primary relations. Some such thing it takes, as existing\nabsolutely and in itself, in order that it may evolve organic nature and\nfinally the knowing subject from it, and explain them adequately by means\nof it; whereas in truth all that is objective is already determined as\nsuch in manifold ways by the knowing subject through its forms of knowing,\nand presupposes them; and consequently it entirely disappears if we think\nthe subject away. Thus materialism is the attempt to explain what is\nimmediately given us by what is given us indirectly. All that is\nobjective, extended, active\u2014that is to say, all that is material\u2014is\nregarded by materialism as affording so solid a basis for its explanation,\nthat a reduction of everything to this can leave nothing to be desired\n(especially if in ultimate analysis this reduction should resolve itself\ninto action and reaction). But we have shown that all this is given\nindirectly and in the highest degree determined, and is therefore merely a\nrelatively present object, for it has passed through the machinery and\nmanufactory of the brain, and has thus come under the forms of space, time\nand causality, by means of which it is first presented to us as extended\nin space and ever active in time. From such an indirectly given object,\nmaterialism seeks to explain what is immediately given, the idea (in which\nalone the object that materialism starts with exists), and finally even\nthe will from which all those fundamental forces, that manifest\nthemselves, under the guidance of causes, and therefore according to law,\nare in truth to be explained. To the assertion that thought is a\nmodification of matter we may always, with equal right, oppose the\ncontrary assertion that all matter is merely the modification of the\nknowing subject, as its idea. Yet the aim and ideal of all natural science\nis at bottom a consistent materialism. The recognition here of the obvious\nimpossibility of such a system establishes another truth which will appear\nin the course of our exposition, the truth that all science properly so\ncalled, by which I understand systematic knowledge under the guidance of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, can never reach its final goal, nor\ngive a complete and adequate explanation: for it is not concerned with the\ninmost nature of the world, it cannot get beyond the idea; indeed, it\nreally teaches nothing more than the relation of one idea to another.\nEvery science must start from two principal data. One of these is always\nthe principle of sufficient reason in some form or another, as organon;\nthe other is its special object as problem. Thus, for example, geometry\nhas space as problem, and the ground of existence in space as organon.\nArithmetic has time as problem, and the ground of existence in time as\norganon. Logic has the combination of concepts as such as problem, and the\nground of knowledge as organon. History has the past acts of men treated\nas a whole as problem, and the law of human motives as organon. Natural\nscience has matter as problem, and the law of causality as organon. Its\nend and aim is therefore, by the guidance of causality, to refer all\npossible states of matter to other states, and ultimately to one single\nstate; and again to deduce these states from each other, and ultimately\nfrom one single state. Thus two states of matter stand over against each\nother in natural science as extremes: that state in which matter is\nfurthest from being the immediate object of the subject, and that state in\nwhich it is most completely such an immediate object, _i.e._, the most\ndead and crude matter, the primary element, as the one extreme, and the\nhuman organism as the other. Natural science as chemistry seeks for the\nfirst, as physiology for the second. But as yet neither extreme has been\nreached, and it is only in the intermediate ground that something has been\nwon. The prospect is indeed somewhat hopeless. The chemists, under the\npresupposition that the qualitative division of matter is not, like\nquantitative division, an endless process, are always trying to decrease\nthe number of the elements, of which there are still about sixty; and if\nthey were to succeed in reducing them to two, they would still try to find\nthe common root of these. For, on the one hand, the law of homogeneity\nleads to the assumption of a primary chemical state of matter, which alone\nbelongs to matter as such, and precedes all others which are not\nessentially matter as such, but merely contingent forms and qualities. On\nthe other hand, we cannot understand how this one state could ever\nexperience a chemical change, if there did not exist a second state to\naffect it. Thus the same difficulty appears in chemistry which Epicurus\nmet with in mechanics. For he had to show how the first atom departed from\nthe original direction of its motion. Indeed this contradiction, which\ndevelops entirely of itself and can neither be escaped nor solved, might\nquite properly be set up as a chemical _antinomy_. Thus an antinomy\nappears in the one extreme of natural science, and a corresponding one\nwill appear in the other. There is just as little hope of reaching this\nopposite extreme of natural science, for we see ever more clearly that\nwhat is chemical can never be referred to what is mechanical, nor what is\norganic to what is chemical or electrical. Those who in our own day are\nentering anew on this old, misleading path, will soon slink back silent\nand ashamed, as all their predecessors have done before them. We shall\nconsider this more fully in the second book. Natural science encounters\nthe difficulties which we have cursorily mentioned, in its own province.\nRegarded as philosophy, it would further be materialism; but this, as we\nhave seen, even at its birth, has death in its heart, because it ignores\nthe subject and the forms of knowledge, which are presupposed, just as\nmuch in the case of the crudest matter, from which it desires to start, as\nin that of the organism, at which it desires to arrive. For, \u201cno object\nwithout a subject,\u201d is the principle which renders all materialism for\never impossible. Suns and planets without an eye that sees them, and an\nunderstanding that knows them, may indeed be spoken of in words, but for\nthe idea, these words are absolutely meaningless. On the other hand, the\nlaw of causality and the treatment and investigation of nature which is\nbased upon it, lead us necessarily to the conclusion that, in time, each\nmore highly organised state of matter has succeeded a cruder state: so\nthat the lower animals existed before men, fishes before land animals,\nplants before fishes, and the unorganised before all that is organised;\nthat, consequently, the original mass had to pass through a long series of\nchanges before the first eye could be opened. And yet, the existence of\nthis whole world remains ever dependent upon the first eye that opened,\neven if it were that of an insect. For such an eye is a necessary\ncondition of the possibility of knowledge, and the whole world exists only\nin and for knowledge, and without it is not even thinkable. The world is\nentirely idea, and as such demands the knowing subject as the supporter of\nits existence. This long course of time itself, filled with innumerable\nchanges, through which matter rose from form to form till at last the\nfirst percipient creature appeared,\u2014this whole time itself is only\nthinkable in the identity of a consciousness whose succession of ideas,\nwhose form of knowing it is, and apart from which, it loses all meaning\nand is nothing at all. Thus we see, on the one hand, the existence of the\nwhole world necessarily dependent upon the first conscious being, however\nundeveloped it may be; on the other hand, this conscious being just as\nnecessarily entirely dependent upon a long chain of causes and effects\nwhich have preceded it, and in which it itself appears as a small link.\nThese two contradictory points of view, to each of which we are led with\nthe same necessity, we might again call an _antinomy_ in our faculty of\nknowledge, and set it up as the counterpart of that which we found in the\nfirst extreme of natural science. The fourfold antinomy of Kant will be\nshown, in the criticism of his philosophy appended to this volume, to be a\ngroundless delusion. But the necessary contradiction which at last\npresents itself to us here, finds its solution in the fact that, to use\nKant\u2019s phraseology, time, space, and causality do not belong to the\nthing-in-itself, but only to its phenomena, of which they are the form;\nwhich in my language means this: The objective world, the world as idea,\nis not the only side of the world, but merely its outward side; and it has\nan entirely different side\u2014the side of its inmost nature\u2014its kernel\u2014the\nthing-in-itself. This we shall consider in the second book, calling it\nafter the most immediate of its objective manifestations\u2014will. But the\nworld as idea, with which alone we are here concerned, only appears with\nthe opening of the first eye. Without this medium of knowledge it cannot\nbe, and therefore it was not before it. But without that eye, that is to\nsay, outside of knowledge, there was also no before, no time. Thus time\nhas no beginning, but all beginning is in time. Since, however, it is the\nmost universal form of the knowable, in which all phenomena are united\ntogether through causality, time, with its infinity of past and future, is\npresent in the beginning of knowledge. The phenomenon which fills the\nfirst present must at once be known as causally bound up with and\ndependent upon a sequence of phenomena which stretches infinitely into the\npast, and this past itself is just as truly conditioned by this first\npresent, as conversely the present is by the past. Accordingly the past\nout of which the first present arises, is, like it, dependent upon the\nknowing subject, without which it is nothing. It necessarily happens,\nhowever, that this first present does not manifest itself as the first,\nthat is, as having no past for its parent, but as being the beginning of\ntime. It manifests itself rather as the consequence of the past, according\nto the principle of existence in time. In the same way, the phenomena\nwhich fill this first present appear as the effects of earlier phenomena\nwhich filled the past, in accordance with the law of causality. Those who\nlike mythological interpretations may take the birth of Kronos (\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2),\nthe youngest of the Titans, as a symbol of the moment here referred to at\nwhich time appears, though, indeed it has no beginning; for with him,\nsince he ate his father, the crude productions of heaven and earth cease,\nand the races of gods and men appear upon the scene.\nThis explanation at which we have arrived by following the most consistent\nof the philosophical systems which start from the object, materialism, has\nbrought out clearly the inseparable and reciprocal dependence of subject\nand object, and at the same time the inevitable antithesis between them.\nAnd this knowledge leads us to seek for the inner nature of the world, the\nthing-in-itself, not in either of the two elements of the idea, but in\nsomething quite distinct from it, and which is not encumbered with such a\nfundamental and insoluble antithesis.\nOpposed to the system we have explained, which starts from the object in\norder to derive the subject from it, is the system which starts from the\nsubject and tries to derive the object from it. The first of these has\nbeen of frequent and common occurrence throughout the history of\nphilosophy, but of the second we find only one example, and that a very\nrecent one; the \u201cphilosophy of appearance\u201d of J. G. Fichte. In this\nrespect, therefore, it must be considered; little real worth or inner\nmeaning as the doctrine itself had. It was indeed for the most part merely\na delusion, but it was delivered with an air of the deepest earnestness,\nwith sustained loftiness of tone and zealous ardour, and was defended with\neloquent polemic against weak opponents, so that it was able to present a\nbrilliant exterior and seemed to be something. But the genuine earnestness\nwhich keeps truth always steadfastly before it as its goal, and is\nunaffected by any external influences, was entirely wanting to Fichte, as\nit is to all philosophers who, like him, concern themselves with questions\nof the day. In his case, indeed, it could not have been otherwise. A man\nbecomes a philosopher by reason of a certain perplexity, from which he\nseeks to free himself. This is Plato\u2019s \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, which he calls a \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2. But what distinguishes the false philosopher from the\ntrue is this: the perplexity of the latter arises from the contemplation\nof the world itself, while that of the former results from some book, some\nsystem of philosophy which is before him. Now Fichte belongs to the class\nof the false philosophers. He was made a philosopher by Kant\u2019s doctrine of\nthe thing-in-itself, and if it had not been for this he would probably\nhave pursued entirely different ends, with far better results, for he\ncertainly possessed remarkable rhetorical talent. If he had only\npenetrated somewhat deeply into the meaning of the book that made him a\nphilosopher, \u201cThe Critique of Pure Reason,\u201d he would have understood that\nits principal teaching about mind is this. The principle of sufficient\nreason is not, as all scholastic philosophy maintains, a _veritas\naeterna_\u2014that is to say, it does not possess an unconditioned validity\nbefore, outside of, and above the world. It is relative and conditioned,\nand valid only in the sphere of phenomena, and thus it may appear as the\nnecessary nexus of space and time, or as the law of causality, or as the\nlaw of the ground of knowledge. The inner nature of the world, the\nthing-in-itself can never be found by the guidance of this principle, for\nall that it leads to will be found to be dependent and relative and merely\nphenomenal, not the thing-in-itself. Further, it does not concern the\nsubject, but is only the form of objects, which are therefore not\nthings-in-themselves. The subject must exist along with the object, and\nthe object along with the subject, so that it is impossible that subject\nand object can stand to each other in a relation of reason and consequent.\nBut Fichte did not take up the smallest fragment of all this. All that\ninterested him about the matter was that the system started from the\nsubject. Now Kant had chosen this procedure in order to show the fallacy\nof the prevalent systems, which started from the object, and through which\nthe object had come, to be regarded as a thing-in-itself. Fichte, however,\ntook this departure from the subject for the really important matter, and\nlike all imitators, he imagined that in going further than Kant he was\nsurpassing him. Thus he repeated the fallacy with regard to the subject,\nwhich all the previous dogmatism had perpetrated with regard to the\nobject, and which had been the occasion of Kant\u2019s \u201cCritique\u201d. Fichte then\nmade no material change, and the fundamental fallacy, the assumption of a\nrelation of reason and consequent between object and subject, remained\nafter him as it was before him. The principle of sufficient reason\npossessed as before an unconditioned validity, and the only difference was\nthat the thing-in-itself was now placed in the subject instead of, as\nformerly, in the object. The entire relativity of both subject and object,\nwhich proves that the thing-in-itself, or the inner nature of the world,\nis not to be sought in them at all, but outside of them, and outside\neverything else that exists merely relatively, still remained unknown.\nJust as if Kant had never existed, the principle of sufficient reason is\nto Fichte precisely what it was to all the schoolmen, a _veritas aeterna_.\nAs an eternal fate reigned over the gods of old, so these _aetern\u00e6\nveritates_, these metaphysical, mathematical and metalogical truths, and\nin the case of some, the validity of the moral law also, reigned over the\nGod of the schoolmen. These _veritates_ alone were independent of\neverything, and through their necessity both God and the world existed.\nAccording to the principle of sufficient reason, as such a _veritas\naeterna_, the _ego_ is for Fichte the ground of the world, or of the\n_non-ego_, the object, which is just its consequent, its creation. He has\ntherefore taken good care to avoid examining further or limiting the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. If, however, it is thought I should\nspecify the form of the principle of sufficient reason under the guidance\nof which Fichte derives the _non-ego_ from the _ego_, as a spider spins\nits web out of itself, I find that it is the principle of sufficient\nreason of existence in space: for it is only as referred to this that some\nkind of meaning and sense can be attached to the laboured deductions of\nthe way in which the _ego_ produces and fabricates the _non-ego_ from\nitself, which form the content of the most senseless, and consequently the\nmost wearisome book that was ever written. This philosophy of Fichte,\notherwise not worth mentioning, is interesting to us only as the tardy\nexpression of the converse of the old materialism. For materialism was the\nmost consistent system starting from the object, as this is the most\nconsistent system starting from the subject. Materialism overlooked the\nfact that, with the simplest object, it assumed the subject also; and\nFichte overlooked the fact that with the subject (whatever he may call it)\nhe assumed the object also, for no subject is thinkable without an object.\nBesides this he forgot that all _a priori_ deduction, indeed all\ndemonstration in general, must rest upon some necessity, and that all\nnecessity is based on the principle of sufficient reason, because to be\nnecessary, and to follow from given grounds are convertible\nconceptions.(10) But the principle of sufficient reason is just the\nuniversal form of the object as such. Thus it is in the object, but is not\nvalid before and outside of it; it first produces the object and makes it\nappear in conformity with its regulative principle. We see then that the\nsystem which starts from the subject contains the same fallacy as the\nsystem, explained above, which starts from the object; it begins by\nassuming what it proposes to deduce, the necessary correlative of its\nstarting-point.\nThe method of our own system is _toto genere_ distinct from these two\nopposite misconceptions, for we start neither from the object nor from the\nsubject, but from the _idea_, as the first fact of consciousness. Its\nfirst essential, fundamental form is the antithesis of subject and object.\nThe form of the object again is the principle of sufficient reason in its\nvarious forms. Each of these reigns so absolutely in its own class of\nideas that, as we have seen, when the special form of the principle of\nsufficient reason which governs any class of ideas is known, the nature of\nthe whole class is known also: for the whole class, as idea, is no more\nthan this form of the principle of sufficient reason itself; so that time\nitself is nothing but the principle of existence in it, _i.e._,\nsuccession; space is nothing but the principle of existence in it, _i.e._,\nposition; matter is nothing but causality; the concept (as will appear\nimmediately) is nothing but relation to a ground of knowledge. This\nthorough and consistent relativity of the world as idea, both according to\nits universal form (subject and object), and according to the form which\nis subordinate to this (the principle of sufficient reason) warns us, as\nwe said before, to seek the inner nature of the world in an aspect of it\nwhich is _quite different and quite distinct from the idea_; and in the\nnext book we shall find this in a fact which is just as immediate to every\nliving being as the idea.\nBut we must first consider that class of ideas which belongs to man alone.\nThe matter of these is the concept, and the subjective correlative is\nreason, just as the subjective correlative of the ideas we have already\nconsidered was understanding and sensibility, which are also to be\nattributed to all the lower animals.(11)\n\u00a7 8. As from the direct light of the sun to the borrowed light of the\nmoon, we pass from the immediate idea of perception, which stands by\nitself and is its own warrant, to reflection, to the abstract, discursive\nconcepts of the reason, which obtain their whole content from knowledge of\nperception, and in relation to it. As long as we continue simply to\nperceive, all is clear, firm, and certain. There are neither questions nor\ndoubts nor errors; we desire to go no further, can go no further; we find\nrest in perceiving, and satisfaction in the present. Perception suffices\nfor itself, and therefore what springs purely from it, and remains true to\nit, for example, a genuine work of art, can never be false, nor can it be\ndiscredited through the lapse of time, for it does not present an opinion\nbut the thing itself. But with abstract knowledge, with reason, doubt and\nerror appear in the theoretical, care and sorrow in the practical. In the\nidea of perception, illusion may at moments take the place of the real;\nbut in the sphere of abstract thought, error may reign for a thousand\nyears, impose its yoke upon whole nations, extend to the noblest impulses\nof humanity, and, by the help of its slaves and its dupes, may chain and\nfetter those whom it cannot deceive. It is the enemy against which the\nwisest men of all times have waged unequal war, and only what they have\nwon from it has become the possession of mankind. Therefore it is well to\ndraw attention to it at once, as we already tread the ground to which its\nprovince belongs. It has often been said that we ought to follow truth\neven although no utility can be seen in it, because it may have indirect\nutility which may appear when it is least expected; and I would add to\nthis, that we ought to be just as anxious to discover and to root out all\nerror even when no harm is anticipated from it, because its mischief may\nbe very indirect, and may suddenly appear when we do not expect it, for\nall error has poison at its heart. If it is mind, if it is knowledge, that\nmakes man the lord of creation, there can be no such thing as harmless\nerror, still less venerable and holy error. And for the consolation of\nthose who in any way and at any time may have devoted strength and life to\nthe noble and hard battle against error, I cannot refrain from adding\nthat, so long as truth is absent, error will have free play, as owls and\nbats in the night; but sooner would we expect to see the owls and the bats\ndrive back the sun in the eastern heavens, than that any truth which has\nonce been known and distinctly and fully expressed, can ever again be so\nutterly vanquished and overcome that the old error shall once more reign\nundisturbed over its wide kingdom. This is the power of truth; its\nconquest is slow and laborious, but if once the victory be gained it can\nnever be wrested back again.\nBesides the ideas we have as yet considered, which, according to their\nconstruction, could be referred to time, space, and matter, if we consider\nthem with reference to the object, or to pure sensibility and\nunderstanding (_i.e._, knowledge of causality), if we consider them with\nreference to the subject, another faculty of knowledge has appeared in man\nalone of all earthly creatures, an entirely new consciousness, which, with\nvery appropriate and significant exactness, is called _reflection_. For it\nis in fact derived from the knowledge of perception, and is a reflected\nappearance of it. But it has assumed a nature fundamentally different. The\nforms of perception do not affect it, and even the principle of sufficient\nreason which reigns over all objects has an entirely different aspect with\nregard to it. It is just this new, more highly endowed, consciousness,\nthis abstract reflex of all that belongs to perception in that conception\nof the reason which has nothing to do with perception, that gives to man\nthat thoughtfulness which distinguishes his consciousness so entirely from\nthat of the lower animals, and through which his whole behaviour upon\nearth is so different from that of his irrational fellow-creatures. He far\nsurpasses them in power and also in suffering. They live in the present\nalone, he lives also in the future and the past. They satisfy the needs of\nthe moment, he provides by the most ingenious preparations for the future,\nyea for days that he shall never see. They are entirely dependent on the\nimpression of the moment, on the effect of the perceptible motive; he is\ndetermined by abstract conceptions independent of the present. Therefore\nhe follows predetermined plans, he acts from maxims, without reference to\nhis surroundings or the accidental impression of the moment. Thus, for\nexample, he can make with composure deliberate preparations for his own\ndeath, he can dissemble past finding out, and can carry his secret with\nhim to the grave; lastly, he has an actual choice between several motives;\nfor only in the abstract can such motives, present together in\nconsciousness, afford the knowledge with regard to themselves, that the\none excludes the other, and can thus measure themselves against each other\nwith reference to their power over the will. The motive that overcomes, in\nthat it decides the question at issue, is the deliberate determinant of\nthe will, and is a sure indication of its character. The brute, on the\nother hand, is determined by the present impression; only the fear of\npresent compulsion can constrain its desires, until at last this fear has\nbecome custom, and as such continues to determine it; this is called\ntraining. The brute feels and perceives; man, in addition to this,\n_thinks_ and _knows_: both _will_. The brute expresses its feelings and\ndispositions by gestures and sounds; man communicates his thought to\nothers, or, if he wishes, he conceals it, by means of speech. Speech is\nthe first production, and also the necessary organ of his reason.\nTherefore in Greek and Italian, speech and reason are expressed by the\nsame word; \u1f41 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, _il discorso_. _Vernunft_ is derived from _vernehmen_,\nwhich is not a synonym for the verb to hear, but signifies the\nconsciousness of the meaning of thoughts communicated in words. It is by\nthe help of language alone that reason accomplishes its most important\nachievements,\u2014the united action of several individuals, the planned\nco-operation of many thousands, civilisation, the state; also science, the\nstoring up of experience, the uniting of common properties in one concept,\nthe communication of truth, the spread of error, thoughts and poems,\ndogmas and superstitions. The brute first knows death when it dies, but\nman draws consciously nearer to it every hour that he lives; and this\nmakes life at times a questionable good even to him who has not recognised\nthis character of constant annihilation in the whole of life. Principally\non this account man has philosophies and religions, though it is uncertain\nwhether the qualities we admire most in his conduct, voluntary rectitude\nand nobility of feeling, were ever the fruit of either of them. As results\nwhich certainly belong only to them, and as productions of reason in this\nsphere, we may refer to the marvellous and monstrous opinions of\nphilosophers of various schools, and the extraordinary and sometimes cruel\ncustoms of the priests of different religions.\nIt is the universal opinion of all times and of all nations that these\nmanifold and far-reaching achievements spring from a common principle,\nfrom that peculiar intellectual power which belongs distinctively to man\nand which has been called reason, \u1f41 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd,\n_ratio_. Besides this, no one finds any difficulty in recognising the\nmanifestations of this faculty, and in saying what is rational and what is\nirrational, where reason appears as distinguished from the other faculties\nand qualities of man, or lastly, in pointing out what, on account of the\nwant of reason, we must never expect even from the most sensible brute.\nThe philosophers of all ages may be said to be on the whole at one about\nthis general knowledge of reason, and they have also given prominence to\nseveral very important manifestations of it; such as, the control of the\nemotions and passions, the capacity for drawing conclusions and\nformulating general principles, even such as are true prior to all\nexperience, and so forth. Still all their explanations of the peculiar\nnature of reason are wavering, not clearly defined, discursive, without\nunity and concentration; now laying stress on one manifestation, now on\nanother, and therefore often at variance with each other. Besides this,\nmany start from the opposition between reason and revelation, a\ndistinction which is unknown to philosophy, and which only increases\nconfusion. It is very remarkable that up till now no philosopher has\nreferred these manifold expressions of reason to one simple function which\nwould be recognised in them all, from which they would all be explained,\nand which would therefore constitute the real inner nature of reason. It\nis true that the excellent Locke in the \u201cEssay on the Human Understanding\u201d\n(Book II., ch. xi., \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11), very rightly refers to general concepts\nas the characteristic which distinguishes man from the brutes, and\nLeibnitz quotes this with full approval in the \u201cNouveaux Essais sur\nl\u2019Entendement Humaine\u201d (Book II., ch. xi., \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11.) But when Locke\n(in Book IV., ch. xvii., \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3) comes to the special explanation of\nreason he entirely loses sight of this simple, primary characteristic, and\nhe also falls into a wavering, undetermined, incomplete account of mangled\nand derivative manifestations of it. Leibnitz also, in the corresponding\npart of his work, behaves in a similar manner, only with more confusion\nand indistinctness. In the Appendix, I have fully considered how Kant\nconfused and falsified the conception of the nature of reason. But whoever\nwill take the trouble to go through in this reference the mass of\nphilosophical writing which has appeared since Kant, will find out, that\njust as the faults of princes must be expiated by whole nations, the\nerrors of great minds extend their influence over whole generations, and\neven over centuries; they grow and propagate themselves, and finally\ndegenerate into monstrosities. All this arises from the fact that, as\nBerkeley says, \u201cFew men think; yet all will have opinions.\u201d\nThe understanding has only one function\u2014immediate knowledge of the\nrelation of cause and effect. Yet the perception of the real world, and\nall common sense, sagacity, and inventiveness, however multifarious their\napplications may be, are quite clearly seen to be nothing more than\nmanifestations of that one function. So also the reason has one function;\nand from it all the manifestations of reason we have mentioned, which\ndistinguish the life of man from that of the brutes, may easily be\nexplained. The application or the non-application of this function is all\nthat is meant by what men have everywhere and always called rational and\nirrational.(12)\n\u00a7 9. Concepts form a distinct class of ideas, existing only in the mind of\nman, and entirely different from the ideas of perception which we have\nconsidered up till now. We can therefore never attain to a sensuous and,\nproperly speaking, evident knowledge of their nature, but only to a\nknowledge which is abstract and discursive. It would, therefore, be absurd\nto demand that they should be verified in experience, if by experience is\nmeant the real external world, which consists of ideas of perception, or\nthat they should be brought before the eyes or the imagination like\nobjects of perception. They can only be thought, not perceived, and only\nthe effects which men accomplish through them are properly objects of\nexperience. Such effects are language, preconceived and planned action and\nscience, and all that results from these. Speech, as an object of outer\nexperience, is obviously nothing more than a very complete telegraph,\nwhich communicates arbitrary signs with the greatest rapidity and the\nfinest distinctions of difference. But what do these signs mean? How are\nthey interpreted? When some one speaks, do we at once translate his words\ninto pictures of the fancy, which instantaneously flash upon us, arrange\nand link themselves together, and assume form and colour according to the\nwords that are poured forth, and their grammatical inflections? What a\ntumult there would be in our brains while we listened to a speech, or to\nthe reading of a book? But what actually happens is not this at all. The\nmeaning of a speech is, as a rule, immediately grasped, accurately and\ndistinctly taken in, without the imagination being brought into play. It\nis reason which speaks to reason, keeping within its own province. It\ncommunicates and receives abstract conceptions, ideas that cannot be\npresented in perceptions, which are framed once for all, and are\nrelatively few in number, but which yet encompass, contain, and represent\nall the innumerable objects of the actual world. This itself is sufficient\nto prove that the lower animals can never learn to speak or comprehend,\nalthough they have the organs of speech and ideas of perception in common\nwith us. But because words represent this perfectly distinct class of\nideas, whose subjective correlative is reason, they are without sense and\nmeaning for the brutes. Thus language, like every other manifestation\nwhich we ascribe to reason, and like everything which distinguishes man\nfrom the brutes, is to be explained from this as its one simple\nsource\u2014conceptions, abstract ideas which cannot be presented in\nperception, but are general, and have no individual existence in space and\ntime. Only in single cases do we pass from the conception to the\nperception, do we construct images as _representatives of concepts_ in\nperception, to which, however, they are never adequate. These cases are\nfully discussed in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, \u00a7 28,\nand therefore I shall not repeat my explanation here. It may be compared,\nhowever, with what is said by Hume in the twelfth of his \u201cPhilosophical\nEssays,\u201d p. 244, and by Herder in the \u201cMetacritik,\u201d pt. i. p. 274 (an\notherwise worthless book). The Platonic idea, the possibility of which\ndepends upon the union of imagination and reason, is the principal subject\nof the third book of this work.\nAlthough concepts are fundamentally different from ideas of perception,\nthey stand in a necessary relation to them, without which they would be\nnothing. This relation therefore constitutes the whole nature and\nexistence of concepts. Reflection is the necessary copy or repetition of\nthe originally presented world of perception, but it is a special kind of\ncopy in an entirely different material. Thus concepts may quite properly\nbe called ideas of ideas. The principle of sufficient reason has here also\na special form. Now we have seen that the form under which the principle\nof sufficient reason appears in a class of ideas always constitutes and\nexhausts the whole nature of the class, so far as it consists of ideas, so\nthat time is throughout succession, and nothing more; space is throughout\nposition, and nothing more; matter is throughout causation, and nothing\nmore. In the same way the whole nature of concepts, or the class of\nabstract ideas, consists simply in the relation which the principle of\nsufficient reason expresses in them; and as this is the relation to the\nground of knowledge, the whole nature of the abstract idea is simply and\nsolely its relation to another idea, which is its ground of knowledge.\nThis, indeed, may, in the first instance, be a concept, an abstract idea,\nand this again may have only a similar abstract ground of knowledge; but\nthe chain of grounds of knowledge does not extend _ad infinitum_; it must\nend at last in a concept which has its ground in knowledge of perception;\nfor the whole world of reflection rests on the world of perception as its\nground of knowledge. Hence the class of abstract ideas is in this respect\ndistinguished from other classes; in the latter the principle of\nsufficient reason always demands merely a relation to another idea of the\n_same_ class, but in the case of abstract ideas, it at last demands a\nrelation to an idea of _another_ class.\nThose concepts which, as has just been pointed out, are not immediately\nrelated to the world of perception, but only through the medium of one, or\nit may be several other concepts, have been called by preference\n_abstracta_, and those which have their ground immediately in the world of\nperception have been called _concreta_. But this last name is only loosely\napplicable to the concepts denoted by it, for they are always merely\n_abstracta_, and not ideas of perception. These names, which have\noriginated in a very dim consciousness of the distinctions they imply, may\nyet, with this explanation, be retained. As examples of the first kind of\nconcepts, _i.e._, _abstracta_ in the fullest sense, we may take\n\u201crelation,\u201d \u201cvirtue,\u201d \u201cinvestigation,\u201d \u201cbeginning,\u201d and so on. As examples\nof the second kind, loosely called _concreta_, we may take such concepts\nas \u201cman,\u201d \u201cstone,\u201d \u201chorse,\u201d &c. If it were not a somewhat too pictorial\nand therefore absurd simile, we might very appropriately call the latter\nthe ground floor, and the former the upper stories of the building of\nreflection.(13)\nIt is not, as is commonly supposed, an essential characteristic of a\nconcept that it should contain much under it, that is to say, that many\nideas of perception, or it may be other abstract ideas, should stand to it\nin the relation of its ground of knowledge, _i.e._, be thought through it.\nThis is merely a derived and secondary characteristic, and, as a matter of\nfact, does not always exist, though it must always exist potentially. This\ncharacteristic arises from the fact that a concept is an idea of an idea,\n_i.e._, its whole nature consists in its relation to another idea; but as\nit is not this idea itself, which is generally an idea of perception and\ntherefore belongs to quite a different class, the latter may have\ntemporal, spacial, and other determinations, and in general many relations\nwhich are not thought along with it in the concept. Thus we see that\nseveral ideas which are different in unessential particulars may be\nthought by means of one concept, _i.e._, may be brought under it. Yet this\npower of embracing several things is not an essential but merely an\naccidental characteristic of the concept. There may be concepts through\nwhich only one real object is thought, but which are nevertheless abstract\nand general, by no means capable of presentation individually and as\nperceptions. Such, for example, is the conception which any one may have\nof a particular town which he only knows from geography; although only\nthis one town is thought under it, it might yet be applied to several\ntowns differing in certain respects. We see then that a concept is not\ngeneral because of being abstracted from several objects; but conversely,\nbecause generality, that is to say, non-determination of the particular,\nbelongs to the concept as an abstract idea of the reason, different things\ncan be thought by means of the same one.\nIt follows from what has been said that every concept, just because it is\nabstract and incapable of presentation in perception, and is therefore not\na completely determined idea, has what is called extension or sphere, even\nin the case in which only one real object exists that corresponds to it.\nNow we always find that the sphere of one concept has something in common\nwith the sphere of other concepts. That is to say, part of what is thought\nunder one concept is the same as what is thought under other concepts; and\nconversely, part of what is thought under these concepts is the same as\nwhat is thought under the first; although, if they are really different\nconcepts, each of them, or at least one of them, contains something which\nthe other does not contain; this is the relation in which every subject\nstands to its predicate. The recognition of this relation is called\njudgment. The representation of these spheres by means of figures in\nspace, is an exceedingly happy idea. It first occurred to Gottfried\nPlouquet, who used squares for the purpose. Lambert, although later than\nhim, used only lines, which he placed under each other. Euler carried out\nthe idea completely with circles. Upon what this complete analogy between\nthe relations of concepts, and those of figures in space, ultimately\nrests, I am unable to say. It is, however, a very fortunate circumstance\nfor logic that all the relations of concepts, according to their\npossibility, _i.e._, _a priori_, may be made plain in perception by the\nuse of such figures, in the following way:\u2014\n(1.) The spheres of two concepts coincide: for example the concept of\nnecessity and the concept of following from given grounds, in the same way\nthe concepts of _Ruminantia_ and _Bisulca_ (ruminating and cloven-hoofed\nanimals), also those of vertebrate and red-blooded animals (although there\nmight be some doubt about this on account of the annelida): they are\nconvertible concepts. Such concepts are represented by a single circle\nwhich stands for either of them.\n(2.) The sphere of one concept includes that of the other.\n[Illustration: Category \"horse\" within category \"animal\".]\n(3.) A sphere includes two or more spheres which exclude each other and\nfill it.\n[Illustration: Circle divided into thirds \"right\", \"acute\", and \"obtuse\".]\n(4.) Two spheres include each a part of the other.\n[Illustration: Two overlapping circles, one \"flower\" and one \"red\".]\n(5.) Two spheres lie in a third, but do not fill it.\n[Illustration: A large circle, \"matter\", within which are two other\ncircles, \"water\" and \"earth\".]\nThis last case applies to all concepts whose spheres have nothing\nimmediately in common, for there is always a third sphere, often a much\nwider one, which includes both.\nTo these cases all combinations of concepts may be referred, and from them\nthe entire doctrine of the judgment, its conversion, contraposition,\nequipollence, disjunction (this according to the third figure) may be\ndeduced. From these also may be derived the properties of the judgment,\nupon which Kant based his pretended categories of the understanding, with\nthe exception however of the hypothetical form, which is not a combination\nof concepts, but of judgments. A full account is given in the Appendix of\n\u201cModality,\u201d and indeed of every property of judgments on which the\ncategories are founded.\nWith regard to the possible combinations of concepts which we have given,\nit has only further to be remarked that they may also be combined with\neach other in many ways. For example, the fourth figure with the second.\nOnly if one sphere, which partly or wholly contains another, is itself\ncontained in a third sphere, do these together exemplify the syllogism in\nthe first figure, _i.e._, that combination of judgments, by means of which\nit is known that a concept which is partly or wholly contained in another\nconcept, is also contained in a third concept, which again contains the\nfirst: and also, conversely, the negation; the pictorial representation of\nwhich can, of course, only be two connected spheres which do not lie\nwithin a third sphere. If many spheres are brought together in this way we\nget a long train of syllogisms. This schematism of concepts, which has\nalready been fairly well explained in more than one textbook, may be used\nas the foundation of the doctrine of the judgment, and indeed of the whole\nsyllogistic theory, and in this way the treatment of both becomes very\neasy and simple. Because, through it, all syllogistic rules may be seen in\ntheir origin, and may be deduced and explained. It is not necessary,\nhowever, to load the memory with these rules, as logic is never of\npractical use, but has only a theoretical interest for philosophy. For\nalthough it may be said that logic is related to rational thinking as\nthorough-bass is to music, or less exactly, as ethics is to virtue, or\n\u00e6sthetics to art; we must yet remember that no one ever became an artist\nby the study of \u00e6sthetics; that a noble character was never formed by the\nstudy of ethics; that long before Rameau, men composed correctly and\nbeautifully, and that we do not need to know thorough-bass in order to\ndetect discords: and just as little do we need to know logic in order to\navoid being misled by fallacies. Yet it must be conceded that\nthorough-bass is of the greatest use in the practice of musical\ncomposition, although it may not be necessary for the understanding of it;\nand indeed \u00e6sthetics and even ethics, though in a much less degree, and\nfor the most part negatively, may be of some use in practice, so that we\ncannot deny them all practical worth, but of logic even this much cannot\nbe conceded. It is nothing more than the knowledge in the abstract of what\nevery one knows in the concrete. Therefore we call in the aid of logical\nrules, just as little to enable us to construct a correct argument as to\nprevent us from consenting to a false one, and the most learned logician\nlays aside the rules of logic altogether in his actual thought. This may\nbe explained in the following way. Every science is a system of general\nand therefore abstract truths, laws, and rules with reference to a special\nclass of objects. The individual case coming under these laws is\ndetermined in accordance with this general knowledge, which is valid once\nfor all; because such application of the general principle is far easier\nthan the exhaustive investigation of the particular case; for the general\nabstract knowledge which has once been obtained is always more within our\nreach than the empirical investigation of the particular case. With logic,\nhowever, it is just the other way. It is the general knowledge of the mode\nof procedure of the reason expressed in the form of rules. It is reached\nby the introspection of reason, and by abstraction from all content. But\nthis mode of procedure is necessary and essential to reason, so that it\nwill never depart from it if left to itself. It is, therefore, easier and\nsurer to let it proceed itself according to its nature in each particular\ncase, than to present to it the knowledge abstracted from this procedure\nin the form of a foreign and externally given law. It is easier, because,\nwhile in the case of all other sciences, the general rule is more within\nour reach than the investigation of the particular case taken by itself;\nwith the use of reason, on the contrary, its necessary procedure in a\ngiven case is always more within our reach than the general rule\nabstracted from it; for that which thinks in us is reason itself. It is\nsurer, because a mistake may more easily occur in such abstract knowledge,\nor in its application, than that a process of reason should take place\nwhich would run contrary to its essence and nature. Hence arises the\nremarkable fact, that while in other sciences the particular case is\nalways proved by the rule, in logic, on the contrary, the rule must always\nbe proved from the particular case; and even the most practised logician,\nif he remark that in some particular case he concludes otherwise than the\nrule prescribes, will always expect to find a mistake in the rule rather\nthan in his own conclusion. To desire to make practical use of logic\nmeans, therefore, to desire to derive with unspeakable trouble, from\ngeneral rules, that which is immediately known with the greatest certainty\nin the particular case. It is just as if a man were to consult mechanics\nas to the motion of his body, and physiology as to his digestion; and\nwhoever has learnt logic for practical purposes is like him who would\nteach a beaver to make its own dam. Logic is, therefore, without practical\nutility; but it must nevertheless be retained, because it has\nphilosophical interest as the special knowledge of the organisation and\naction of reason. It is rightly regarded as a definite, self-subsisting,\nself-contained, complete, and thoroughly safe discipline; to be treated\nscientifically for itself alone and independently of everything else, and\ntherefore to be studied at the universities. But it has its real value, in\nrelation to philosophy as a whole, in the inquiry into the nature of\nknowledge, and indeed of rational and abstract knowledge. Therefore the\nexposition of logic should not have so much the form of a practical\nscience, should not contain merely naked arbitrary rules for the correct\nformation of the judgment, the syllogism, &c., but should rather be\ndirected to the knowledge of the nature of reason and the concept, and to\nthe detailed investigation of the principle of sufficient reason of\nknowing. For logic is only a paraphrase of this principle, and, more\nexactly, only of that exemplification of it in which the ground that gives\ntruth to the judgment is neither empirical nor metaphysical, but logical\nor metalogical. Besides the principle of sufficient reason of knowing, it\nis necessary to take account of the three remaining fundamental laws of\nthought, or judgments of metalogical truth, so nearly related to it; and\nout of these the whole science of reason grows. The nature of thought\nproper, that is to say, of the judgment and the syllogism, must be\nexhibited in the combination of the spheres of concepts, according to the\nanalogy of the special schema, in the way shown above; and from all this\nthe rules of the judgment and the syllogism are to be deduced by\nconstruction. The only practical use we can make of logic is in a debate,\nwhen we can convict our antagonist of his intentional fallacies, rather\nthan of his actual mistakes, by giving them their technical names. By thus\nthrowing into the background the practical aim of logic, and bringing out\nits connection with the whole scheme of philosophy as one of its chapters,\nwe do not think that we shall make the study of it less prevalent than it\nis just now. For at the present day every one who does not wish to remain\nuncultured, and to be numbered with the ignorant and incompetent\nmultitude, must study speculative philosophy. For the nineteenth century\nis a philosophical age, though by this we do not mean either that it has\nphilosophy, or that philosophy governs it, but rather that it is ripe for\nphilosophy, and, therefore, stands in need of it. This is a sign of a high\ndegree of civilisation, and indeed, is a definite stage in the culture of\nthe ages.(14)\nThough logic is of so little practical use, it cannot be denied that it\nwas invented for practical purposes. It appears to me to have originated\nin the following way:\u2014As the love of debating developed among the\nEleatics, the Megarics, and the Sophists, and by degrees became almost a\npassion, the confusion in which nearly every debate ended must have made\nthem feel the necessity of a method of procedure as a guide; and for this\na scientific dialectic had to be sought. The first thing which would have\nto be observed would be that both the disputing parties should always be\nagreed on some one proposition, to which the disputed points might be\nreferred. The beginning of the methodical procedure consisted in this,\nthat the propositions admitted on both sides were formally stated to be\nso, and placed at the head of the inquiry. But these propositions were at\nfirst concerned only with the material of the inquiry. It was soon\nobserved that in the process of going back to the truth admitted on both\nsides, and of deducing their assertions from it, each party followed\ncertain forms and laws about which, without any express agreement, there\nwas no difference of opinion. And from this it became evident that these\nmust constitute the peculiar and natural procedure of reason itself, the\nform of investigation. Although this was not exposed to any doubt or\ndifference of opinion, some pedantically systematic philosopher hit upon\nthe idea that it would look well, and be the completion of the method of\ndialectic, if this formal part of all discussion, this regular procedure\nof reason itself, were to be expressed in abstract propositions, just like\nthe substantial propositions admitted on both sides, and placed at the\nbeginning of every investigation, as the fixed canon of debate to which\nreference and appeal must always be made. In this way what had formerly\nbeen followed only by tacit agreement, and instinctively, would be\nconsciously recognised and formally expressed. By degrees, more or less\nperfect expressions were found for the fundamental principles of logic,\nsuch as the principles of contradiction, sufficient reason, excluded\nmiddle, the _dictum de omni et nullo_, as well as the special rules of the\nsyllogism, as for example, _ex meris particularibus aut negativis nihil\nsequitur, a rationato ad rationem non valet consequentia_, and so on. That\nall this was only brought about slowly, and with great pains, and up till\nthe time of Aristotle remained very incomplete, is evident from the\nawkward and tedious way in which logical truths are brought out in many of\nthe Platonic dialogues, and still more from what Sextus Empiricus tells us\nof the controversies of the Megarics, about the easiest and simplest\nlogical rules, and the laborious way in which they were brought into a\ndefinite form (Sext. Emp. adv. Math. l. 8, p. 112). But Aristotle\ncollected, arranged, and corrected all that had been discovered before his\ntime, and brought it to an incomparably greater state of perfection. If we\nthus observe how the course of Greek culture had prepared the way for, and\nled up to the work of Aristotle, we shall be little inclined to believe\nthe assertion of the Persian author, quoted by Sir William Jones with much\napproval, that Kallisthenes found a complete system of logic among the\nIndians, and sent it to his uncle Aristotle (Asiatic Researches, vol. iv.\np. 163). It is easy to understand that in the dreary middle ages the\nAristotelian logic would be very acceptable to the controversial spirit of\nthe schoolmen, which, in the absence of all real knowledge, spent its\nenergy upon mere formulas and words, and that it would be eagerly adopted\neven in its mutilated Arabian form, and presently established as the\ncentre of all knowledge. Though its authority has since declined, yet up\nto our own time logic has retained the credit of a self-contained,\npractical, and highly important science. Indeed, in our own day, the\nKantian philosophy, the foundation-stone of which is taken from logic, has\nexcited a new interest in it; which, in this respect, at any rate, that\nis, as the means of the knowledge of the nature of reason, it deserves.\nCorrect and accurate conclusions may be arrived at if we carefully observe\nthe relation of the spheres of concepts, and only conclude that one sphere\nis contained in a third sphere, when we have clearly seen that this first\nsphere is contained in a second, which in its turn is contained in the\nthird. On the other hand, the art of sophistry lies in casting only a\nsuperficial glance at the relations of the spheres of the concepts, and\nthen manipulating these relations to suit our purposes, generally in the\nfollowing way:\u2014When the sphere of an observed concept lies partly within\nthat of another concept, and partly within a third altogether different\nsphere, we treat it as if it lay entirely within the one or the other, as\nmay suit our purpose. For example, in speaking of passion, we may subsume\nit under the concept of the greatest force, the mightiest agency in the\nworld, or under the concept of the irrational, and this again under the\nconcept of impotency or weakness. We may then repeat the process, and\nstart anew with each concept to which the argument leads us. A concept has\nalmost always several others, which partially come under it, and each of\nthese contains part of the sphere of the first, but also includes in its\nown sphere something more, which is not in the first. But we draw\nattention only to that one of these latter concepts, under which we wish\nto subsume the first, and let the others remain unobserved, or keep them\nconcealed. On the possession of this skill depends the whole art of\nsophistry and all finer fallacies; for logical fallacies such as\n_mentiens_, _velatus_, _cornatus_, &c., are clearly too clumsy for actual\nuse. I am not aware that hitherto any one has traced the nature of all\nsophistry and persuasion back to this last possible ground of its\nexistence, and referred it to the peculiar character of concepts, _i.e._,\nto the procedure of reason itself. Therefore, as my exposition has led me\nto it, though it is very easily understood, I will illustrate it in the\nfollowing table by means of a schema. This table is intended to show how\nthe spheres of concepts overlap each other at many points, and so leave\nroom for a passage from each concept to whichever one we please of several\nother concepts. I hope, however, that no one will be led by this table to\nattach more importance to this little explanation, which I have merely\ngiven in passing, than ought to belong to it, from the nature of the\nsubject. I have chosen as an illustration the concept of travelling. Its\nsphere partially includes four others, to any of which the sophist may\npass at will; these again partly include other spheres, several of them\ntwo or more at once, and through these the sophist takes whichever way he\nchooses, always as if it were the only way, till at last he reaches, in\ngood or evil, whatever end he may have in view. In passing from one sphere\nto another, it is only necessary always to follow the direction from the\ncentre (the given chief concept) to the circumference, and never to\nreverse this process. Such a piece of sophistry may be either an unbroken\nspeech, or it may assume the strict syllogistic form, according to what is\nthe weak side of the hearer. Most scientific arguments, and especially\nphilosophical demonstrations, are at bottom not much more than this, for\nhow else would it be possible, that so much, in different ages, has not\nonly been falsely apprehended (for error itself has a different source),\nbut demonstrated and proved, and has yet afterwards been found to be\nfundamentally wrong, for example, the Leibnitz-Wolfian Philosophy,\nPtolemaic Astronomy, Stahl\u2019s Chemistry, Newton\u2019s Theory of Colours, &c.\n&c.(15)\n\u00a7 10. Through all this, the question presses ever more upon us, how\n_certainty_ is to be attained, how _judgments __ are to be established_,\nwhat constitutes _rational knowledge_, (_wissen_), and _science_, which we\nrank with language and deliberate action as the third great benefit\nconferred by reason.\nReason is feminine in nature; it can only give after it has received. Of\nitself it has nothing but the empty forms of its operation. There is no\nabsolutely pure rational knowledge except the four principles to which I\nhave attributed metalogical truth; the principles of identity,\ncontradiction, excluded middle, and sufficient reason of knowledge. For\neven the rest of logic is not absolutely pure rational knowledge. It\npresupposes the relations and the combinations of the spheres of concepts.\nBut concepts in general only exist after experience of ideas of\nperception, and as their whole nature consists in their relation to these,\nit is clear that they presuppose them. No special content, however, is\npresupposed, but merely the existence of a content generally, and so logic\nas a whole may fairly pass for pure rational science. In all other\nsciences reason has received its content from ideas of perception; in\nmathematics from the relations of space and time, presented in intuition\nor perception prior to all experience; in pure natural science, that is,\nin what we know of the course of nature prior to any experience, the\ncontent of the science proceeds from the pure understanding, _i.e._, from\nthe _a priori_ knowledge of the law of causality and its connection with\nthose pure intuitions or perceptions of space and time. In all other\nsciences everything that is not derived from the sources we have just\nreferred to belongs to experience. Speaking generally, _to know\nrationally_ (_wissen_) means to have in the power of the mind, and capable\nof being reproduced at will, such judgments as have their sufficient\nground of knowledge in something outside themselves, _i.e._, are true.\nThus only abstract cognition is _rational knowledge_ (_wissen_), which is\ntherefore the result of reason, so that we cannot accurately say of the\nlower animals that they _rationally __ know_ (_wissen_) anything, although\nthey have apprehension of what is presented in perception, and memory of\nthis, and consequently imagination, which is further proved by the\ncircumstance that they dream. We attribute consciousness to them, and\ntherefore although the word (_bewusstsein_) is derived from the verb to\nknow rationally (_wissen_), the conception of consciousness corresponds\ngenerally with that of idea of whatever kind it may be. Thus we attribute\nlife to plants, but not consciousness. _Rational knowledge_ (_wissen_) is\ntherefore abstract consciousness, the permanent possession in concepts of\nthe reason, of what has become known in another way.\n\u00a7 11. In this regard the direct opposite of _rational knowledge_ is\nfeeling, and therefore we must insert the explanation of feeling here. The\nconcept which the word feeling denotes has merely a negative content,\nwhich is this, that something which is present in consciousness, _is not a\nconcept_, _is not abstract rational knowledge_. Except this, whatever it\nmay be, it comes under the concept of _feeling_. Thus the immeasurably\nwide sphere of the concept of feeling includes the most different kinds of\nobjects, and no one can ever understand how they come together until he\nhas recognised that they all agree in this negative respect, that they are\nnot _abstract concepts_. For the most diverse and even antagonistic\nelements lie quietly side by side in this concept; for example, religious\nfeeling, feeling of sensual pleasure, moral feeling, bodily feeling, as\ntouch, pain, sense of colour, of sounds and their harmonies and discords,\nfeeling of hate, of disgust, of self-satisfaction, of honour, of disgrace,\nof right, of wrong, sense of truth, \u00e6sthetic feeling, feeling of power,\nweakness, health, friendship, love, &c. &c. There is absolutely nothing in\ncommon among them except the negative quality that they are not abstract\nrational knowledge. But this diversity becomes more striking when the\napprehension of space relations presented _a priori_ in perception, and\nalso the knowledge of the pure understanding is brought under this\nconcept, and when we say of all knowledge and all truth, of which we are\nfirst conscious only intuitively, and have not yet formulated in abstract\nconcepts, we _feel_ it. I should like, for the sake of illustration, to\ngive some examples of this taken from recent books, as they are striking\nproofs of my theory. I remember reading in the introduction to a German\ntranslation of Euclid, that we ought to make beginners in geometry draw\nthe figures before proceeding to demonstrate, for in this way they would\nalready feel geometrical truth before the demonstration brought them\ncomplete knowledge. In the same way Schleiermacher speaks in his \u201cCritique\nof Ethics\u201d of logical and mathematical feeling (p. 339), and also of the\nfeeling of the sameness or difference of two formulas (p. 342). Again\nTennemann in his \u201cHistory of Philosophy\u201d (vol. I., p. 361) says, \u201cOne\n_felt_ that the fallacies were not right, but could not point out the\nmistakes.\u201d Now, so long as we do not regard this concept \u201c_feeling_\u201d from\nthe right point of view, and do not recognise that one negative\ncharacteristic which alone is essential to it, it must constantly give\noccasion for misunderstanding and controversy, on account of the excessive\nwideness of its sphere, and its entirely negative and very limited content\nwhich is determined in a purely one-sided manner. Since then we have in\nGerman the nearly synonymous word _empfindung_ (sensation), it would be\nconvenient to make use of it for bodily feeling, as a sub-species. This\nconcept \u201cfeeling,\u201d which is quite out of proportion to all others,\ndoubtless originated in the following manner. All concepts, and concepts\nalone, are denoted by words; they exist only for the reason, and proceed\nfrom it. With concepts, therefore, we are already at a one-sided point of\nview; but from such a point of view what is near appears distinct and is\nset down as positive, what is farther off becomes mixed up and is soon\nregarded as merely negative. Thus each nation calls all others foreign: to\nthe Greek all others are barbarians; to the Englishman all that is not\nEngland or English is continent or continental; to the believer all others\nare heretics, or heathens; to the noble all others are _roturiers_; to the\nstudent all others are Philistines, and so forth. Now, reason itself,\nstrange as it may seem, is guilty of the same one-sidedness, indeed one\nmight say of the same crude ignorance arising from vanity, for it classes\nunder the one concept, \u201c_feeling_,\u201d every modification of consciousness\nwhich does not immediately belong to its own mode of apprehension, that is\nto say, which is _not an abstract concept_. It has had to pay the penalty\nof this hitherto in misunderstanding and confusion in its own province,\nbecause its own procedure had not become clear to it through thorough\nself-knowledge, for a special faculty of feeling has been set up, and new\ntheories of it are constructed.\n\u00a7 12. _Rational knowledge_ (_wissen_) is then all abstract knowledge,\u2014that\nis, the knowledge which is peculiar to the reason as distinguished from\nthe understanding. Its contradictory opposite has just been explained to\nbe the concept \u201cfeeling.\u201d Now, as reason only reproduces, for knowledge,\nwhat has been received in another way, it does not actually extend our\nknowledge, but only gives it another form. It enables us to know in the\nabstract and generally, what first became known in sense-perception, in\nthe concrete. But this is much more important than it appears at first\nsight when so expressed. For it depends entirely upon the fact that\nknowledge has become rational or abstract knowledge (_wissen_), that it\ncan be safely preserved, that it is communicable and susceptible of\ncertain and wide-reaching application to practice. Knowledge in the form\nof sense-perception is valid only of the particular case, extends only to\nwhat is nearest, and ends with it, for sensibility and understanding can\nonly comprehend one object at a time. Every enduring, arranged, and\nplanned activity must therefore proceed from principles,\u2014that is, from\nabstract knowledge, and it must be conducted in accordance with them.\nThus, for example, the knowledge of the relation of cause and effect\narrived at by the understanding, is in itself far completer, deeper and\nmore exhaustive than anything that can be thought about it in the\nabstract; the understanding alone knows in perception directly and\ncompletely the nature of the effect of a lever, of a pulley, or a\ncog-wheel, the stability of an arch, and so forth. But on account of the\npeculiarity of the knowledge of perception just referred to, that it only\nextends to what is immediately present, the mere understanding can never\nenable us to construct machines and buildings. Here reason must come in;\nit must substitute abstract concepts for ideas of perception, and take\nthem as the guide of action; and if they are right, the anticipated result\nwill happen. In the same way we have perfect knowledge in pure perception\nof the nature and constitution of the parabola, hyperbola, and spiral; but\nif we are to make trustworthy application of this knowledge to the real,\nit must first become abstract knowledge, and by this it certainly loses\nits character of intuition or perception, but on the other hand it gains\nthe certainty and preciseness of abstract knowledge. The differential\ncalculus does not really extend our knowledge of the curve, it contains\nnothing that was not already in the mere pure perception of the curve; but\nit alters the kind of knowledge, it changes the intuitive into an abstract\nknowledge, which is so valuable for application. But here we must refer to\nanother peculiarity of our faculty of knowledge, which could not be\nobserved until the distinction between the knowledge of the senses and\nunderstanding and abstract knowledge had been made quite clear. It is\nthis, that relations of space cannot as such be directly translated into\nabstract knowledge, but only temporal quantities,\u2014that is, numbers, are\nsuitable for this. Numbers alone can be expressed in abstract concepts\nwhich accurately correspond to them, not spacial quantities. The concept\n\u201cthousand\u201d is just as different from the concept \u201cten,\u201d as both these\ntemporal quantities are in perception. We think of a thousand as a\ndistinct multiple of ten, into which we can resolve it at pleasure for\nperception in time,\u2014that is to say, we can count it. But between the\nabstract concept of a mile and that of a foot, apart from any concrete\nperception of either, and without the help of number, there is no accurate\ndistinction corresponding to the quantities themselves. In both we only\nthink of a spacial quantity in general, and if they must be completely\ndistinguished we are compelled either to call in the assistance of\nintuition or perception in space, which would be a departure from abstract\nknowledge, or we must think the difference in _numbers_. If then we wish\nto have abstract knowledge of space-relations we must first translate them\ninto time-relations,\u2014that is, into numbers; therefore only arithmetic, and\nnot geometry, is the universal science of quantity, and geometry must be\ntranslated into arithmetic if it is to be communicable, accurately precise\nand applicable in practice. It is true that a space-relation as such may\nalso be thought in the abstract; for example, \u201cthe sine increases as the\nangle,\u201d but if the quantity of this relation is to be given, it requires\nnumber for its expression. This necessity, that if we wish to have\nabstract knowledge of space-relations (_i.e._, rational knowledge, not\nmere intuition or perception), space with its three dimensions must be\ntranslated into time which has only one dimension, this necessity it is,\nwhich makes mathematics so difficult. This becomes very clear if we\ncompare the perception of curves with their analytical calculation, or the\ntable of logarithms of the trigonometrical functions with the perception\nof the changing relations of the parts of a triangle, which are expressed\nby them. What vast mazes of figures, what laborious calculations it would\nrequire to express in the abstract what perception here apprehends at a\nglance completely and with perfect accuracy, namely, how the co-sine\ndiminishes as the sine increases, how the co-sine of one angle is the sine\nof another, the inverse relation of the increase and decrease of the two\nangles, and so forth. How time, we might say, must complain, that with its\none dimension it should be compelled to express the three dimensions of\nspace! Yet this is necessary if we wish to possess, for application, an\nexpression, in abstract concepts, of space-relations. They could not be\ntranslated directly into abstract concepts, but only through the medium of\nthe pure temporal quantity, number, which alone is directly related to\nabstract knowledge. Yet it is worthy of remark, that as space adapts\nitself so well to perception, and by means of its three dimensions, even\nits complicated relations are easily apprehended, while it eludes the\ngrasp of abstract knowledge; time, on the contrary, passes easily into\nabstract knowledge, but gives very little to perception. Our perceptions\nof numbers in their proper element, mere time, without the help of space,\nscarcely extends as far as ten, and beyond that we have only abstract\nconcepts of numbers, no knowledge of them which can be presented in\nperception. On the other hand, we connect with every numeral, and with all\nalgebraical symbols, accurately defined abstract concepts.\nWe may further remark here that some minds only find full satisfaction in\nwhat is known through perception. What they seek is the reason and\nconsequent of being in space, sensuously expressed; a demonstration after\nthe manner of Euclid, or an arithmetical solution of spacial problems,\ndoes not please them. Other minds, on the contrary, seek merely the\nabstract concepts which are needful for applying and communicating\nknowledge. They have patience and memory for abstract principles,\nformulas, demonstrations in long trains of reasoning, and calculations, in\nwhich the symbols represent the most complicated abstractions. The latter\nseek preciseness, the former sensible perception. The difference is\ncharacteristic.\nThe greatest value of rational or abstract knowledge is that it can be\ncommunicated and permanently retained. It is principally on this account\nthat it is so inestimably important for practice. Any one may have a\ndirect perceptive knowledge through the understanding alone, of the causal\nconnection, of the changes and motions of natural bodies, and he may find\nentire satisfaction in it; but he cannot communicate this knowledge to\nothers until it has been made permanent for thought in concepts. Knowledge\nof the first kind is even sufficient for practice, if a man puts his\nknowledge into practice himself, in an action which can be accomplished\nwhile the perception is still vivid; but it is not sufficient if the help\nof others is required, or even if the action is his own but must be\ncarried out at different times, and therefore requires a pre-conceived\nplan. Thus, for example, a practised billiard-player may have a perfect\nknowledge of the laws of the impact of elastic bodies upon each other,\nmerely in the understanding, merely for direct perception; and for him it\nis quite sufficient; but on the other hand it is only the man who has\nstudied the science of mechanics, who has, properly speaking, a rational\nknowledge of these laws, that is, a knowledge of them in the abstract.\nSuch knowledge of the understanding in perception is sufficient even for\nthe construction of machines, when the inventor of the machine executes\nthe work himself; as we often see in the case of talented workmen, who\nhave no scientific knowledge. But whenever a number of men, and their\nunited action taking place at different times, is required for the\ncompletion of a mechanical work, of a machine, or a building, then he who\nconducts it must have thought out the plan in the abstract, and such\nco-operative activity is only possible through the assistance of reason.\nIt is, however, remarkable that in the first kind of activity, in which we\nhave supposed that one man alone, in an uninterrupted course of action,\naccomplishes something, abstract knowledge, the application of reason or\nreflection, may often be a hindrance to him; for example, in the case of\nbilliard-playing, of fighting, of tuning an instrument, or in the case of\nsinging. Here perceptive knowledge must directly guide action; its passage\nthrough reflection makes it uncertain, for it divides the attention and\nconfuses the man. Thus savages and untaught men, who are little accustomed\nto think, perform certain physical exercises, fight with beasts, shoot\nwith bows and arrows and the like, with a certainty and rapidity which the\nreflecting European never attains to, just because his deliberation makes\nhim hesitate and delay. For he tries, for example, to hit the right\nposition or the right point of time, by finding out the mean between two\nfalse extremes; while the savage hits it directly without thinking of the\nfalse courses open to him. In the same way it is of no use to me to know\nin the abstract the exact angle, in degrees and minutes, at which I must\napply a razor, if I do not know it intuitively, that is, if I have not got\nit in my touch. The knowledge of physiognomy also, is interfered with by\nthe application of reason. This knowledge must be gained directly through\nthe understanding. We say that the expression, the meaning of the\nfeatures, can only be _felt_, that is, it cannot be put into abstract\nconcepts. Every man has his direct intuitive method of physiognomy and\npathognomy, yet one man understands more clearly than another these\n_signatura rerum_. But an abstract science of physiognomy to be taught and\nlearned is not possible; for the distinctions of difference are here so\nfine that concepts cannot reach them; therefore abstract knowledge is\nrelated to them as a mosaic is to a painting by a Van der Werft or a\nDenner. In mosaics, however fine they may be, the limits of the stones are\nalways there, and therefore no continuous passage from one colour to\nanother is possible, and this is also the case with regard to concepts,\nwith their rigidity and sharp delineation; however finely we may divide\nthem by exact definition, they are still incapable of reaching the finer\nmodifications of the perceptible, and this is just what happens in the\nexample we have taken, knowledge of physiognomy.(16)\nThis quality of concepts by which they resemble the stones of a mosaic,\nand on account of which perception always remains their asymptote, is also\nthe reason why nothing good is produced in art by their means. If the\nsinger or the virtuoso attempts to guide his execution by reflection he\nremains silent. And this is equally true of the composer, the painter, and\nthe poet. The concept always remains unfruitful in art; it can only direct\nthe technical part of it, its sphere is science. We shall consider more\nfully in the third book, why all true art proceeds from sensuous\nknowledge, never from the concept. Indeed, with regard to behaviour also,\nand personal agreeableness in society, the concept has only a negative\nvalue in restraining the grosser manifestations of egotism and brutality;\nso that a polished manner is its commendable production. But all that is\nattractive, gracious, charming in behaviour, all affectionateness and\nfriendliness, must not proceed from the concepts, for if it does, \u201cwe feel\nintention, and are put out of tune.\u201d All dissimulation is the work of\nreflection; but it cannot be maintained constantly and without\ninterruption: \u201c_nemo __ potest personam diu ferre fictum_,\u201d says Seneca in\nhis book _de clementia_; and so it is generally found out and loses its\neffect. Reason is needed in the full stress of life, where quick\nconclusions, bold action, rapid and sure comprehension are required, but\nit may easily spoil all if it gains the upper hand, and by perplexing\nhinders the intuitive, direct discovery, and grasp of the right by simple\nunderstanding, and thus induces irresolution.\nLastly, virtue and holiness do not proceed from reflection, but from the\ninner depths of the will, and its relation to knowledge. The exposition of\nthis belongs to another part of our work; this, however, I may remark\nhere, that the dogmas relating to ethics may be the same in the reason of\nwhole nations, but the action of every individual different; and the\nconverse also holds good; action, we say, is guided by _feelings_,\u2014that\nis, simply not by concepts, but as a matter of fact by the ethical\ncharacter. Dogmas occupy the idle reason; but action in the end pursues\nits own course independently of them, generally not according to abstract\nrules, but according to unspoken maxims, the expression of which is the\nwhole man himself. Therefore, however different the religious dogmas of\nnations may be, yet in the case of all of them, a good action is\naccompanied by unspeakable satisfaction, and a bad action by endless\nremorse. No mockery can shake the former; no priest\u2019s absolution can\ndeliver from the latter. Notwithstanding this, we must allow, that for the\npursuit of a virtuous life, the application of reason is needful; only it\nis not its source, but has the subordinate function of preserving\nresolutions which have been made, of providing maxims to withstand the\nweakness of the moment, and give consistency to action. It plays the same\npart ultimately in art also, where it has just as little to do with the\nessential matter, but assists in carrying it out, for genius is not always\nat call, and yet the work must be completed in all its parts and rounded\noff to a whole.(17)\n\u00a7 13. All these discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of the\napplication of reason are intended to show, that although abstract\nrational knowledge is the reflex of ideas of perception, and is founded on\nthem, it is by no means in such entire congruity with them that it could\neverywhere take their place: indeed it never corresponds to them quite\naccurately. And thus, as we have seen, many human actions can only be\nperformed by the help of reason and deliberation, and yet there are some\nwhich are better performed without its assistance. This very incongruity\nof sensuous and abstract knowledge, on account of which the latter always\nmerely approximates to the former, as mosaic approximates to painting, is\nthe cause of a very remarkable phenomenon which, like reason itself, is\npeculiar to human nature, and of which the explanations that have ever\nanew been attempted, are insufficient: I mean _laughter_. On account of\nthe source of this phenomenon, we cannot avoid giving the explanation of\nit here, though it again interrupts the course of our work to do so. The\ncause of laughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the\nincongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been thought\nthrough it in some relation, and laughter itself is just the expression of\nthis incongruity. It often occurs in this way: two or more real objects\nare thought through _one_ concept, and the identity of the concept is\ntransferred to the objects; it then becomes strikingly apparent from the\nentire difference of the objects in other respects, that the concept was\nonly applicable to them from a one-sided point of view. It occurs just as\noften, however, that the incongruity between a single real object and the\nconcept under which, from one point of view, it has rightly been subsumed,\nis suddenly felt. Now the more correct the subsumption of such objects\nunder a concept may be from one point of view, and the greater and more\nglaring their incongruity with it, from another point of view, the greater\nis the ludicrous effect which is produced by this contrast. All laughter\nthen is occasioned by a paradox, and therefore by unexpected subsumption,\nwhether this is expressed in words or in actions. This, briefly stated, is\nthe true explanation of the ludicrous.\nI shall not pause here to relate anecdotes as examples to illustrate my\ntheory; for it is so simple and comprehensible that it does not require\nthem, and everything ludicrous which the reader may remember is equally\nvaluable as a proof of it. But the theory is confirmed and illustrated by\ndistinguishing two species into which the ludicrous is divided, and which\nresult from the theory. Either, we have previously known two or more very\ndifferent real objects, ideas of sense-perception, and have intentionally\nidentified them through the unity of a concept which comprehends them\nboth; this species of the ludicrous is called _wit_. Or, conversely, the\nconcept is first present in knowledge, and we pass from it to reality, and\nto operation upon it, to action: objects which in other respects are\nfundamentally different, but which are all thought in that one concept,\nare now regarded and treated in the same way, till, to the surprise and\nastonishment of the person acting, the great difference of their other\naspects appears: this species of the ludicrous is called _folly_.\nTherefore everything ludicrous is either a flash of wit or a foolish\naction, according as the procedure has been from the discrepancy of the\nobjects to the identity of the concept, or the converse; the former always\nintentional, the latter always unintentional, and from without. To seem to\nreverse the starting-point, and to conceal wit with the mask of folly, is\nthe art of the jester and the clown. Being quite aware of the diversity of\nthe objects, the jester unites them, with secret wit, under one concept,\nand then starting from this concept he receives from the subsequently\ndiscovered diversity of the objects the surprise which he himself\nprepared. It follows from this short but sufficient theory of the\nludicrous, that, if we set aside the last case, that of the jester, wit\nmust always show itself in words, folly generally in actions, though also\nin words, when it only expresses an intention and does not actually carry\nit out, or when it shows itself merely in judgments and opinions.\n_Pedantry_ is a form of folly. It arises in this way: a man lacks\nconfidence in his own understanding, and, therefore, does not wish to\ntrust to it, to recognise what is right directly in the particular case.\nHe, therefore, puts it entirely under the control of the reason, and seeks\nto be guided by reason in everything; that is to say, he tries always to\nproceed from general concepts, rules, and maxims, and to confine himself\nstrictly to them in life, in art, and even in moral conduct. Hence that\nclinging to the form, to the manner, to the expression and word which is\ncharacteristic of pedantry, and which with it takes the place of the real\nnature of the matter. The incongruity then between the concept and reality\nsoon shows itself here, and it becomes evident that the former never\ncondescends to the particular case, and that with its generality and rigid\ndefiniteness it can never accurately apply to the fine distinctions of\ndifference and innumerable modifications of the actual. Therefore, the\npedant, with his general maxims, almost always misses the mark in life,\nshows himself to be foolish, awkward, useless. In art, in which the\nconcept is unfruitful, he produces lifeless, stiff, abortive mannerisms.\nEven with regard to ethics, the purpose to act rightly or nobly cannot\nalways be carried out in accordance with abstract maxims; for in many\ncases the excessively nice distinctions in the nature of the circumstances\nnecessitate a choice of the right proceeding directly from the character;\nfor the application of mere abstract maxims sometimes gives false results,\nbecause the maxims only half apply; and sometimes cannot be carried out,\nbecause they are foreign to the individual character of the actor, and\nthis never allows itself to be entirely discovered; therefore,\ninconsistencies arise. Since then Kant makes it a condition of the moral\nworth of an action, that it shall proceed from pure rational abstract\nmaxims, without any inclination or momentary emotion, we cannot entirely\nabsolve him from the reproach of encouraging moral pedantry. This reproach\nis the significance of Schiller\u2019s epigram, entitled \u201cScruples of\nConscience.\u201d When we speak, especially in connection with politics, of\ndoctrinaires, theorists, savants, and so forth, we mean pedants, that is,\npersons who know the things well in the abstract, but not in the concrete.\nAbstraction consists in thinking away the less general predicates; but it\nis precisely upon these that so much depends in practice.\nTo complete our theory it remains for us to mention a spurious kind of\nwit, the play upon words, the _calembourg_, the pun, to which may be added\nthe equivocation, the _double entendre_, the chief use of which is the\nexpression of what is obscene. Just as the witticism brings two very\ndifferent real objects under one concept, the pun brings two different\nconcepts, by the assistance of accident, under one word. The same contrast\nappears, only familiar and more superficial, because it does not spring\nfrom the nature of things, but merely from the accident of nomenclature.\nIn the case of the witticism the identity is in the concept, the\ndifference in the reality, but in the case of the pun the difference is in\nthe concepts and the identity in the reality, for the terminology is here\nthe reality. It would only be a somewhat far-fetched comparison if we were\nto say that the pun is related to the witticism as the parabola (_sic_) of\nthe upper inverted cone to that of the lower. The misunderstanding of the\nword or the _quid pro quo_ is the unintentional pun, and is related to it\nexactly as folly is to wit. Thus the deaf man often affords occasion for\nlaughter, just as much as the fool, and inferior writers of comedy often\nuse the former for the latter to raise a laugh.\nI have treated laughter here only from the psychical side; with regard to\nthe physical side, I refer to what is said on the subject in the\n\u201cParerga,\u201d vol. II. ch. vi., \u00a7 98.(18)\n\u00a7 14. By means of these various discussions it is hoped that both the\ndifference and the relation between the process of knowledge that belongs\nto the reason, rational knowledge, the concept on the one hand, and the\ndirect knowledge in purely sensuous, mathematical intuition or perception,\nand apprehension by the understanding on the other hand, has been clearly\nbrought out. This remarkable relation of our kinds of knowledge led us\nalmost inevitably to give, in passing, explanations of feeling and of\nlaughter, but from all this we now turn back to the further consideration\nof science as the third great benefit which reason confers on man, the\nother two being speech and deliberate action. The general discussion of\nscience which now devolves upon us, will be concerned partly with its\nform, partly with the foundation of its judgments, and lastly with its\ncontent.\nWe have seen that, with the exception of the basis of pure logic, rational\nknowledge in general has not its source in the reason itself; but having\nbeen otherwise obtained as knowledge of perception, it is stored up in the\nreason, for through reason it has entirely changed its character, and has\nbecome abstract knowledge. All rational knowledge, that is, knowledge that\nhas been raised to consciousness in the abstract, is related to science\nstrictly so called, as a fragment to the whole. Every one has gained a\nrational knowledge of many different things through experience, through\nconsideration of the individual objects presented to him, but only he who\nsets himself the task of acquiring a complete knowledge in the abstract of\na particular class of objects, strives after science. This class can only\nbe marked off by means of a concept; therefore, at the beginning of every\nscience there stands a concept, and by means of it the class of objects\nconcerning which this science promises a complete knowledge in the\nabstract, is separated in thought from the whole world of things. For\nexample, the concept of space-relations, or of the action of unorganised\nbodies upon each other, or of the nature of plants, or of animals, or of\nthe successive changes of the surface of the globe, or of the changes of\nthe human race as a whole, or of the construction of a language, and so\nforth. If science sought to obtain the knowledge of its object, by\ninvestigating each individual thing that is thought through the concept,\ntill by degrees it had learned the whole, no human memory would be equal\nto the task, and no certainty of completeness would be obtainable.\nTherefore, it makes use of that property of concept-spheres explained\nabove, that they include each other, and it concerns itself mainly with\nthe wider spheres which lie within the concept of its object in general.\nWhen the relations of these spheres to each other have been determined,\nall that is thought in them is also generally determined, and can now be\nmore and more accurately determined by the separation of smaller and\nsmaller concept-spheres. In this way it is possible for a science to\ncomprehend its object completely. This path which it follows to knowledge,\nthe path from the general to the particular, distinguishes it from\nordinary rational knowledge; therefore, systematic form is an essential\nand characteristic feature of science. The combination of the most general\nconcept-spheres of every science, that is, the knowledge of its first\nprinciples, is the indispensable condition of mastering it; how far we\nadvance from these to the more special propositions is a matter of choice,\nand does not increase the thoroughness but only the extent of our\nknowledge of the science. The number of the first principles to which all\nthe rest are subordinated, varies greatly in the different sciences, so\nthat in some there is more subordination, in others more co-ordination;\nand in this respect, the former make greater claims upon the judgment, the\nlatter upon the memory. It was known to the schoolmen,(19) that, as the\nsyllogism requires two premises, no science can proceed from a single\nfirst principle which cannot be the subject of further deduction, but must\nhave several, at least two. The specially classifying sciences: Zoology,\nBotany, and also Physics and Chemistry, inasmuch as they refer all\ninorganic action to a few fundamental forces, have most subordination;\nhistory, on the other hand, has really none at all; for the general in it\nconsists merely in the survey of the principal periods, from which,\nhowever, the particular events cannot be deduced, and are only\nsubordinated to them according to time, but according to the concept are\nco-ordinate with them. Therefore, history, strictly speaking, is certainly\nrational knowledge, but is not science. In mathematics, according to\nEuclid\u2019s treatment, the axioms alone are indemonstrable first principles,\nand all demonstrations are in gradation strictly subordinated to them. But\nthis method of treatment is not essential to mathematics, and in fact each\nproposition introduces quite a new space construction, which in itself is\nindependent of those which precede it, and indeed can be completely\ncomprehended from itself, quite independently of them, in the pure\nintuition or perception of space, in which the most complicated\nconstruction is just as directly evident as the axiom; but of this more\nfully hereafter. Meanwhile every mathematical proposition remains always a\nuniversal truth, which is valid for innumerable particular cases; and a\ngraduated process from the simple to the complicated propositions which\nare to be deduced from them, is also essential to mathematics; therefore,\nin every respect mathematics is a science. The completeness of a science\nas such, that is, in respect of form, consists in there being as much\nsubordination and as little co-ordination of the principles as possible.\nScientific talent in general is, therefore, the faculty of subordinating\nthe concept-spheres according to their different determinations, so that,\nas Plato repeatedly counsels, a science shall not be constituted by a\ngeneral concept and an indefinite multiplicity immediately under it, but\nthat knowledge shall descend by degrees from the general to the\nparticular, through intermediate concepts and divisions, according to\ncloser and closer definitions. In Kantian language this is called\nsatisfying equally the law of homogeneity and that of specification. It\narises from this peculiar nature of scientific completeness, that the aim\nof science is not greater certainty\u2014for certainty may be possessed in just\nas high a degree by the most disconnected particular knowledge\u2014but its aim\nis rather the facilitating of rational knowledge by means of its form, and\nthe possibility of the completeness of rational knowledge which this form\naffords. It is therefore a very prevalent but perverted opinion that the\nscientific character of knowledge consists in its greater certainty, and\njust as false is the conclusion following from this, that, strictly\nspeaking, the only sciences are mathematics and logic, because only in\nthem, on account of their purely _a priori_ character, is there\nunassailable certainty of knowledge. This advantage cannot be denied them,\nbut it gives them no special claim to be regarded as sciences; for the\nspecial characteristic of science does not lie in certainty but in the\nsystematic form of knowledge, based on the gradual descent from the\ngeneral to the particular. The process of knowledge from the general to\nthe particular, which is peculiar to the sciences, involves the necessity\nthat in the sciences much should be established by deduction from\npreceding propositions, that is to say, by demonstration; and this has\ngiven rise to the old mistake that only what has been demonstrated is\nabsolutely true, and that every truth requires a demonstration; whereas,\non the contrary, every demonstration requires an undemonstrated truth,\nwhich ultimately supports it, or it may be, its own demonstration.\nTherefore a directly established truth is as much to be preferred to a\ntruth established by demonstration as water from the spring is to water\nfrom the aqueduct. Perception, partly pure _a priori_, as it forms the\nbasis of mathematics, partly empirical _a posteriori_, as it forms the\nbasis of all the other sciences, is the source of all truth and the\nfoundation of all science. (Logic alone is to be excepted, which is not\nfounded upon perception but yet upon _direct_ knowledge by the reason of\nits own laws.) Not the demonstrated judgments nor their demonstrations,\nbut judgments which are created directly out of perception, and founded\nupon it rather than on any demonstrations, are to science what the sun is\nto the world; for all light proceeds from them, and lighted by their light\nthe others give light also. To establish the truth of such primary\njudgments directly from perception, to raise such strongholds of science\nfrom the innumerable multitude of real objects, that is the work of the\n_faculty of judgment_, which consists in the power of rightly and\naccurately carrying over into abstract consciousness what is known in\nperception, and judgment is consequently the mediator between\nunderstanding and reason. Only extraordinary and exceptional strength of\njudgment in the individual can actually advance science; but every one who\nis possessed of a healthy reason is able to deduce propositions from\npropositions, to demonstrate, to draw conclusions. To lay down and make\npermanent for reflection, in suitable concepts, what is known through\nperception, so that, on the one hand, what is common to many real objects\nis thought through _one_ concept, and, on the other hand, their points of\ndifference are each thought through one concept, so that the different\nshall be known and thought as different in spite of a partial agreement,\nand the identical shall be known and thought as identical in spite of a\npartial difference, all in accordance with the end and intention which in\neach case is in view; all this is done by the _faculty of judgment_.\nDeficiency in judgment is _silliness_. The silly man fails to grasp, now\nthe partial or relative difference of concepts which in one aspect are\nidentical, now the identity of concepts which are relatively or partially\ndifferent. To this explanation of the faculty of judgment, moreover,\nKant\u2019s division of it into reflecting and subsuming judgment may be\napplied, according as it passes from the perceived objects to the\nconcepts, or from the latter to the former; in both cases always mediating\nbetween empirical knowledge of the understanding and the reflective\nknowledge of the reason. There can be no truth which could be brought out\nby means of syllogisms alone; and the necessity of establishing truth by\nmeans of syllogisms is merely relative, indeed subjective. Since all\ndemonstration is syllogistic, in the case of a new truth we must first\nseek, not for a demonstration, but for direct evidence, and only in the\nabsence of such evidence is a demonstration to be temporarily made use of.\nNo science is susceptible of demonstration throughout any more than a\nbuilding can stand in the air; all its demonstrations must ultimately rest\nupon what is perceived, and consequently cannot be demonstrated, for the\nwhole world of reflection rests upon and is rooted in the world of\nperception. All primal, that is, original, _evidence_ is a _perception_,\nas the word itself indicates. Therefore it is either empirical or founded\nupon the perception _a priori_ of the conditions of possible experience.\nIn both cases it affords only immanent, not transcendent knowledge. Every\nconcept has its worth and its existence only in its relation, sometimes\nvery indirect, to an idea of perception; what is true of the concepts is\nalso true of the judgments constructed out of them, and of all science.\nTherefore it must in some way be possible to know directly without\ndemonstrations or syllogisms every truth that is arrived at through\nsyllogisms and communicated by demonstrations. This is most difficult in\nthe case of certain complicated mathematical propositions at which we only\narrive by chains of syllogisms; for example, the calculation of the chords\nand tangents to all arcs by deduction from the proposition of Pythagoras.\nBut even such a truth as this cannot essentially and solely rest upon\nabstract principles, and the space-relations which lie at its foundation\nalso must be capable of being so presented _a priori_ in pure intuition or\nperception that the truth of their abstract expression is directly\nestablished. But of mathematical demonstration we shall speak more fully\nshortly.\nIt is true we often hear men speak in a lofty strain of sciences which\nrest entirely upon correct conclusions drawn from sure premises, and which\nare consequently unassailable. But through pure logical reasoning, however\ntrue the premises may be, we shall never receive more than an articulate\nexpression and exposition of what lies already complete in the premises;\nthus we shall only _explicitly_ expound what was already _implicitly_\nunderstood. The esteemed sciences referred to are, however, specially the\nmathematical sciences, particularly astronomy. But the certainty of\nastronomy arises from the fact that it has for its basis the intuition or\nperception of space, which is given _a priori_, and is therefore\ninfallible. All space-relations, however, follow from each other with a\nnecessity (ground of being) which affords _a priori_ certainty, and they\ncan therefore be safely deduced from each other. To these mathematical\nproperties we have only to add one force of nature, gravity, which acts\nprecisely in relation to the masses and the square of the distance; and,\nlastly, the law of inertia, which follows from the law of causality and is\ntherefore true _a priori_, and with it the empirical datum of the motion\nimpressed, once for all, upon each of these masses. This is the whole\nmaterial of astronomy, which both by its simplicity and its certainty\nleads to definite results, which are highly interesting on account of the\nvastness and importance of the objects. For example, if I know the mass of\na planet and the distance of its satellite from it, I can tell with\ncertainty the period of the revolution of the latter according to Kepler\u2019s\nsecond law. But the ground of this law is, that with this distance only\nthis velocity will both chain the satellite to the planet and prevent it\nfrom falling into it. Thus it is only upon such a geometrical basis, that\nis, by means of an intuition or perception _a priori_, and also under the\napplication of a law of nature, that much can be arrived at by means of\nsyllogisms, for here they are merely like bridges from _one_ sensuous\napprehension to others; but it is not so with mere pure syllogistic\nreasoning in the exclusively logical method. The source of the first\nfundamental truths of astronomy is, however, properly induction, that is,\nthe comprehension of what is given in many perceptions in one true and\ndirectly founded judgment. From this, hypotheses are afterwards\nconstructed, and their confirmation by experience, as induction\napproaching to completeness, affords the proof of the first judgment. For\nexample, the apparent motion of the planets is known empirically; after\nmany false hypotheses with regard to the spacial connection of this motion\n(planetary course) the right one was at last found, then the laws which it\nobeyed (the laws of Kepler), and, lastly, the cause of these laws\n(universal gravitation), and the empirically known agreement of all\nobserved cases with the whole of the hypotheses, and with their\nconsequences, that is to say, induction, established them with complete\ncertainty. The invention of the hypotheses was the work of the judgment,\nwhich rightly comprehended the given facts and expressed them accordingly;\nbut induction, that is, a multitude of perceptions, confirmed their truth.\nBut their truth could also be known directly, and by a single empirical\nperception, if we could pass freely through space and had telescopic eyes.\nTherefore, here also syllogisms are not the essential and only source of\nknowledge, but really only a makeshift.\nAs a third example taken from a different sphere we may mention that the\nso-called metaphysical truths, that is, such truths as those to which Kant\nassigns the position of the metaphysical first principles of natural\nscience, do not owe their evidence to demonstration. What is _a priori_\ncertain we know directly; as the form of all knowledge, it is known to us\nwith the most complete necessity. For example, that matter is permanent,\nthat is, can neither come into being nor pass away, we know directly as\nnegative truth; for our pure intuition or perception of space and time\ngives the possibility of motion; in the law of causality the understanding\naffords us the possibility of change of form and quality, but we lack\npowers of the imagination for conceiving the coming into being or passing\naway of matter. Therefore that truth has at all times been evident to all\nmen everywhere, nor has it ever been seriously doubted; and this could not\nbe the case if it had no other ground of knowledge than the abstruse and\nexceedingly subtle proof of Kant. But besides this, I have found Kant\u2019s\nproof to be false (as is explained in the Appendix), and have shown above\nthat the permanence of matter is to be deduced, not from the share which\ntime has in the possibility of experience, but from the share which\nbelongs to space. The true foundation of all truths which in this sense\nare called metaphysical, that is, abstract expressions of the necessary\nand universal forms of knowledge, cannot itself lie in abstract\nprinciples; but only in the immediate consciousness of the forms of the\nidea communicating itself in apodictic assertions _a priori_, and fearing\nno refutation. But if we yet desire to give a proof of them, it can only\nconsist in showing that what is to be proved is contained in some truth\nabout which there is no doubt, either as a part of it or as a\npresupposition. Thus, for example, I have shown that all empirical\nperception implies the application of the law of causality, the knowledge\nof which is hence a condition of all experience, and therefore cannot be\nfirst given and conditioned through experience as Hume thought.\nDemonstrations in general are not so much for those who wish to learn as\nfor those who wish to dispute. Such persons stubbornly deny directly\nestablished insight; now only the truth can be consistent in all\ndirections, and therefore we must show such persons that they admit under\n_one_ form and indirectly, what they deny under another form and directly;\nthat is, the logically necessary connection between what is denied and\nwhat is admitted.\nIt is also a consequence of the scientific form, the subordination of\neverything particular under a general, and so on always to what is more\ngeneral, that the truth of many propositions is only logically\nproved,\u2014that is, through their dependence upon other propositions, through\nsyllogisms, which at the same time appear as proofs. But we must never\nforget that this whole form of science is merely a means of rendering\nknowledge more easy, not a means to greater certainty. It is easier to\ndiscover the nature of an animal, by means of the species to which it\nbelongs, and so on through the genus, family, order, and class, than to\nexamine on every occasion the animal presented to us: but the truth of all\npropositions arrived at syllogistically is always conditioned by and\nultimately dependent upon some truth which rests not upon reasoning but\nupon perception. If this perception were always as much within our reach\nas a deduction through syllogisms, then it would be in every respect\npreferable. For every deduction from concepts is exposed to great danger\nof error, on account of the fact we have considered above, that so many\nspheres lie partly within each other, and that their content is often\nvague or uncertain. This is illustrated by a multitude of demonstrations\nof false doctrines and sophisms of every kind. Syllogisms are indeed\nperfectly certain as regards form, but they are very uncertain on account\nof their matter, the concepts. For, on the one hand, the spheres of these\nare not sufficiently sharply defined, and, on the other hand, they\nintersect each other in so many ways that one sphere is in part contained\nin many others, and we may pass at will from it to one or another of\nthese, and from this sphere again to others, as we have already shown. Or,\nin other words, the minor term and also the middle can always be\nsubordinated to different concepts, from which we may choose at will the\nmajor and the middle, and the nature of the conclusion depends on this\nchoice. Consequently immediate evidence is always much to be preferred to\nreasoned truth, and the latter is only to be accepted when the former is\ntoo remote, and not when it is as near or indeed nearer than the latter.\nAccordingly we saw above that, as a matter of fact, in the case of logic,\nin which the immediate knowledge in each individual case lies nearer to\nhand than deduced scientific knowledge, we always conduct our thought\naccording to our immediate knowledge of the laws of thought, and leave\nlogic unused.(20)\n\u00a7 15. If now with our conviction that perception is the primary source of\nall evidence, and that only direct or indirect connection with it is\nabsolute truth; and further, that the shortest way to this is always the\nsurest, as every interposition of concepts means exposure to many\ndeceptions; if, I say, we now turn with this conviction to mathematics, as\nit was established as a science by Euclid, and has remained as a whole to\nour own day, we cannot help regarding the method it adopts, as strange and\nindeed perverted. We ask that every logical proof shall be traced back to\nan origin in perception; but mathematics, on the contrary, is at great\npains deliberately to throw away the evidence of perception which is\npeculiar to it, and always at hand, that it may substitute for it a\nlogical demonstration. This must seem to us like the action of a man who\ncuts off his legs in order to go on crutches, or like that of the prince\nin the \u201c_Triumph der Empfindsamkeit_\u201d who flees from the beautiful reality\nof nature, to delight in a stage scene that imitates it. I must here refer\nto what I have said in the sixth chapter of the essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, and take for granted that it is fresh and present in\nthe memory of the reader; so that I may link my observations on to it\nwithout explaining again the difference between the mere ground of\nknowledge of a mathematical truth, which can be given logically, and the\nground of being, which is the immediate connection of the parts of space\nand time, known only in perception. It is only insight into the ground of\nbeing that secures satisfaction and thorough knowledge. The mere ground of\nknowledge must always remain superficial; it can afford us indeed rational\nknowledge _that_ a thing is as it is, but it cannot tell _why_ it is so.\nEuclid chose the latter way to the obvious detriment of the science. For\njust at the beginning, for example, when he ought to show once for all how\nin a triangle the angles and sides reciprocally determine each other, and\nstand to each other in the relation of reason and consequent, in\naccordance with the form which the principle of sufficient reason has in\npure space, and which there, as in every other sphere, always affords the\nnecessity that a thing is as it is, because something quite different from\nit, is as it is; instead of in this way giving a thorough insight into the\nnature of the triangle, he sets up certain disconnected arbitrarily chosen\npropositions concerning the triangle, and gives a logical ground of\nknowledge of them, through a laborious logical demonstration, based upon\nthe principle of contradiction. Instead of an exhaustive knowledge of\nthese space-relations we therefore receive merely certain results of them,\nimparted to us at pleasure, and in fact we are very much in the position\nof a man to whom the different effects of an ingenious machine are shown,\nbut from whom its inner connection and construction are withheld. We are\ncompelled by the principle of contradiction to admit that what Euclid\ndemonstrates is true, but we do not comprehend _why_ it is so. We have\ntherefore almost the same uncomfortable feeling that we experience after a\njuggling trick, and, in fact, most of Euclid\u2019s demonstrations are\nremarkably like such feats. The truth almost always enters by the back\ndoor, for it manifests itself _per accidens_ through some contingent\ncircumstance. Often a _reductio ad absurdum_ shuts all the doors one after\nanother, until only one is left through which we are therefore compelled\nto enter. Often, as in the proposition of Pythagoras, lines are drawn, we\ndon\u2019t know why, and it afterwards appears that they were traps which close\nunexpectedly and take prisoner the assent of the astonished learner, who\nmust now admit what remains wholly inconceivable in its inner connection,\nso much so, that he may study the whole of Euclid through and through\nwithout gaining a real insight into the laws of space-relations, but\ninstead of them he only learns by heart certain results which follow from\nthem. This specially empirical and unscientific knowledge is like that of\nthe doctor who knows both the disease and the cure for it, but does not\nknow the connection between them. But all this is the necessary\nconsequence if we capriciously reject the special kind of proof and\nevidence of one species of knowledge, and forcibly introduce in its stead\na kind which is quite foreign to its nature. However, in other respects\nthe manner in which this has been accomplished by Euclid deserves all the\npraise which has been bestowed on him through so many centuries, and which\nhas been carried so far that his method of treating mathematics has been\nset up as the pattern of all scientific exposition. Men tried indeed to\nmodel all the sciences after it, but later they gave up the attempt\nwithout quite knowing why. Yet in our eyes this method of Euclid in\nmathematics can appear only as a very brilliant piece of perversity. But\nwhen a great error in life or in science has been intentionally and\nmethodically carried out with universal applause, it is always possible to\ndiscover its source in the philosophy which prevailed at the time. The\nEleatics first brought out the difference, and indeed often the conflict,\nthat exists between what is perceived, \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd,(21) and what is\nthought, \u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, and used it in many ways in their philosophical\nepigrams, and also in sophisms. They were followed later by the Megarics,\nthe Dialecticians, the Sophists, the New-Academy, and the Sceptics; these\ndrew attention to the illusion, that is to say, to the deception of the\nsenses, or rather of the understanding which transforms the data of the\nsenses into perception, and which often causes us to see things to which\nthe reason unhesitatingly denies reality; for example, a stick broken in\nwater, and such like. It came to be known that sense-perception was not to\nbe trusted unconditionally, and it was therefore hastily concluded that\nonly rational, logical thought could establish truth; although Plato (in\nthe Parmenides), the Megarics, Pyrrho, and the New-Academy, showed by\nexamples (in the manner which was afterwards adopted by Sextus Empiricus)\nhow syllogisms and concepts were also sometimes misleading, and indeed\nproduced paralogisms and sophisms which arise much more easily and are far\nharder to explain than the illusion of sense-perception. However, this\nrationalism, which arose in opposition to empiricism, kept the upper hand,\nand Euclid constructed the science of mathematics in accordance with it.\nHe was compelled by necessity to found the axioms upon evidence of\nperception (\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd), but all the rest he based upon reasoning\n(\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd). His method reigned supreme through all the succeeding\ncenturies, and it could not but do so as long as pure intuition or\nperception, _a priori_, was not distinguished from empirical perception.\nCertain passages from the works of Proclus, the commentator of Euclid,\nwhich Kepler translated into Latin in his book, \u201cDe Harmonia Mundi,\u201d seem\nto show that he fully recognised this distinction. But Proclus did not\nattach enough importance to the matter; he merely mentioned it by the way,\nso that he remained unnoticed and accomplished nothing. Therefore, not\ntill two thousand years later will the doctrine of Kant, which is destined\nto make such great changes in all the knowledge, thought, and action of\nEuropean nations, produce this change in mathematics also. For it is only\nafter we have learned from this great man that the intuitions or\nperceptions of space and time are quite different from empirical\nperceptions, entirely independent of any impression of the senses,\nconditioning it, not conditioned by it, _i.e._, are _a priori_, and\ntherefore are not exposed to the illusions of sense; only after we have\nlearned this, I say, can we comprehend that Euclid\u2019s logical method of\ntreating mathematics is a useless precaution, a crutch for sound legs,\nthat it is like a wanderer who during the night mistakes a bright, firm\nroad for water, and carefully avoiding it, toils over the broken ground\nbeside it, content to keep from point to point along the edge of the\nsupposed water. Only now can we affirm with certainty that what presents\nitself to us as necessary in the perception of a figure, does not come\nfrom the figure on the paper, which is perhaps very defectively drawn, nor\nfrom the abstract concept under which we think it, but immediately from\nthe form of all knowledge of which we are conscious _a priori_. This is\nalways the principle of sufficient reason; here as the form of perception,\n_i.e._, space, it is the principle of the ground of being, the evidence\nand validity of which is, however, just as great and as immediate as that\nof the principle of the ground of knowing, _i.e._, logical certainty. Thus\nwe need not and ought not to leave the peculiar province of mathematics in\norder to put our trust only in logical proof, and seek to authenticate\nmathematics in a sphere which is quite foreign to it, that of concepts. If\nwe confine ourselves to the ground peculiar to mathematics, we gain the\ngreat advantage that in it the rational knowledge _that_ something is, is\none with the knowledge _why_ it is so, whereas the method of Euclid\nentirely separates these two, and lets us know only the first, not the\nsecond. Aristotle says admirably in the Analyt., post. i. 27: \u201c\u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\n\u03b4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1, \u1f21\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f41\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f21 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03bc\u03b7 \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f41\u03c4\u03b9, \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u201d (_Subtilior autem et praestantior ea est\nscientia, qu\u00e2_ QUOD _aliquid sit, et_ CUR _sit una simulque intelligimus\nnon separatim_ QUOD, _et_ CUR _sit_). In physics we are only satisfied\nwhen the knowledge that a thing is as it is is combined with the knowledge\nwhy it is so. To know that the mercury in the Torricellian tube stands\nthirty inches high is not really rational knowledge if we do not know that\nit is sustained at this height by the counterbalancing weight of the\natmosphere. Shall we then be satisfied in mathematics with the _qualitas\nocculta_ of the circle that the segments of any two intersecting chords\nalways contain equal rectangles? That it is so Euclid certainly\ndemonstrates in the 35th Prop. of the Third Book; _why_ it is so remains\ndoubtful. In the same way the proposition of Pythagoras teaches us a\n_qualitas occulta_ of the right-angled triangle; the stilted and indeed\nfallacious demonstration of Euclid forsakes us at the _why_, and a simple\nfigure, which we already know, and which is present to us, gives at a\nglance far more insight into the matter, and firm inner conviction of that\nnecessity, and of the dependence of that quality upon the right angle:\u2014\n[Illustration]\nIn the case of unequal catheti also, and indeed generally in the case of\nevery possible geometrical truth, it is quite possible to obtain such a\nconviction based on perception, because these truths were always\ndiscovered by such an empirically known necessity, and their demonstration\nwas only thought out afterwards in addition. Thus we only require an\nanalysis of the process of thought in the first discovery of a geometrical\ntruth in order to know its necessity empirically. It is the analytical\nmethod in general that I wish for the exposition of mathematics, instead\nof the synthetical method which Euclid made use of. Yet this would have\nvery great, though not insuperable, difficulties in the case of\ncomplicated mathematical truths. Here and there in Germany men are\nbeginning to alter the exposition of mathematics, and to proceed more in\nthis analytical way. The greatest effort in this direction has been made\nby Herr Kosack, teacher of mathematics and physics in the Gymnasium at\nNordhausen, who added a thorough attempt to teach geometry according to my\nprinciples to the programme of the school examination on the 6th of April\n1852.\nIn order to improve the method of mathematics, it is especially necessary\nto overcome the prejudice that demonstrated truth has any superiority over\nwhat is known through perception, or that logical truth founded upon the\nprinciple of contradiction has any superiority over metaphysical truth,\nwhich is immediately evident, and to which belongs the pure intuition or\nperception of space.\nThat which is most certain, and yet always inexplicable, is what is\ninvolved in the principle of sufficient reason, for this principle, in its\ndifferent aspects, expresses the universal form of all our ideas and\nknowledge. All explanation consists of reduction to it, exemplification in\nthe particular case of the connection of ideas expressed generally through\nit. It is thus the principle of all explanation, and therefore it is\nneither susceptible of an explanation itself, nor does it stand in need of\nit; for every explanation presupposes it, and only obtains meaning through\nit. Now, none of its forms are superior to the rest; it is equally certain\nand incapable of demonstration as the principle of the ground of being, or\nof change, or of action, or of knowing. The relation of reason and\nconsequent is a necessity in all its forms, and indeed it is, in general,\nthe source of the concept of necessity, for necessity has no other\nmeaning. If the reason is given there is no other necessity than that of\nthe consequent, and there is no reason that does not involve the necessity\nof the consequent. Just as surely then as the consequent expressed in the\nconclusion follows from the ground of knowledge given in the premises,\ndoes the ground of being in space determine its consequent in space: if I\nknow through perception the relation of these two, this certainty is just\nas great as any logical certainty. But every geometrical proposition is\njust as good an expression of such a relation as one of the twelve axioms;\nit is a metaphysical truth, and as such, just as certain as the principle\nof contradiction itself, which is a metalogical truth, and the common\nfoundation of all logical demonstration. Whoever denies the necessity,\nexhibited for intuition or perception, of the space-relations expressed in\nany proposition, may just as well deny the axioms, or that the conclusion\nfollows from the premises, or, indeed, he may as well deny the principle\nof contradiction itself, for all these relations are equally\nundemonstrable, immediately evident and known _a priori_. For any one to\nwish to derive the necessity of space-relations, known in intuition or\nperception, from the principle of contradiction by means of a logical\ndemonstration is just the same as for the feudal superior of an estate to\nwish to hold it as the vassal of another. Yet this is what Euclid has\ndone. His axioms only, he is compelled to leave resting upon immediate\nevidence; all the geometrical truths which follow are demonstrated\nlogically, that is to say, from the agreement of the assumptions made in\nthe proposition with the axioms which are presupposed, or with some\nearlier proposition; or from the contradiction between the opposite of the\nproposition and the assumptions made in it, or the axioms, or earlier\npropositions, or even itself. But the axioms themselves have no more\nimmediate evidence than any other geometrical problem, but only more\nsimplicity on account of their smaller content.\nWhen a criminal is examined, a _proc\u00e8s-verbal_ is made of his statement in\norder that we may judge of its truth from its consistency. But this is\nonly a makeshift, and we are not satisfied with it if it is possible to\ninvestigate the truth of each of his answers for itself; especially as he\nmight lie consistently from the beginning. But Euclid investigated space\naccording to this first method. He set about it, indeed, under the correct\nassumption that nature must everywhere be consistent, and that therefore\nit must also be so in space, its fundamental form. Since then the parts of\nspace stand to each other in a relation of reason and consequent, no\nsingle property of space can be different from what it is without being in\ncontradiction with all the others. But this is a very troublesome,\nunsatisfactory, and roundabout way to follow. It prefers indirect\nknowledge to direct, which is just as certain, and it separates the\nknowledge that a thing is from the knowledge why it is, to the great\ndisadvantage of the science; and lastly, it entirely withholds from the\nbeginner insight into the laws of space, and indeed renders him\nunaccustomed to the special investigation of the ground and inner\nconnection of things, inclining him to be satisfied with a mere historical\nknowledge that a thing is as it is. The exercise of acuteness which this\nmethod is unceasingly extolled as affording consists merely in this, that\nthe pupil practises drawing conclusions, _i.e._, he practises applying the\nprinciple of contradiction, but specially he exerts his memory to retain\nall those data whose agreement is to be tested. Moreover, it is worth\nnoticing that this method of proof was applied only to geometry and not to\narithmetic. In arithmetic the truth is really allowed to come home to us\nthrough perception alone, which in it consists simply in counting. As the\nperception of numbers is in _time alone_, and therefore cannot be\nrepresented by a sensuous schema like the geometrical figure, the\nsuspicion that perception is merely empirical, and possibly illusive,\ndisappeared in arithmetic, and the introduction of the logical method of\nproof into geometry was entirely due to this suspicion. As time has only\none dimension, counting is the only arithmetical operation, to which all\nothers may be reduced; and yet counting is just intuition or perception _a\npriori_, to which there is no hesitation in appealing here, and through\nwhich alone everything else, every sum and every equation, is ultimately\nproved. We prove, for example, not that (7 + 9 \u00d7 8 - 2)/3 = 42; but we\nrefer to the pure perception in time, counting thus makes each individual\nproblem an axiom. Instead of the demonstrations that fill geometry, the\nwhole content of arithmetic and algebra is thus simply a method of\nabbreviating counting. We mentioned above that our immediate perception of\nnumbers in time extends only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract concept\nof the numbers, fixed by a word, must take the place of the perception;\nwhich does not therefore actually occur any longer, but is only indicated\nin a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by the important assistance\nof the system of figures which enables us to represent all larger numbers\nby the same small ones, intuitive or perceptive evidence of every sum is\nmade possible, even where we make such use of abstraction that not only\nthe numbers, but indefinite quantities and whole operations are thought\nonly in the abstract and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that\nwe do not perform them, but merely symbolise them.\nWe might establish truth in geometry also, through pure _a priori_\nperception, with the same right and certainty as in arithmetic. It is in\nfact always this necessity, known through perception in accordance with\nthe principle of sufficient reason of being, which gives to geometry its\nprincipal evidence, and upon which in the consciousness of every one, the\ncertainty of its propositions rests. The stilted logical demonstration is\nalways foreign to the matter, and is generally soon forgotten, without\nweakening our conviction. It might indeed be dispensed with altogether\nwithout diminishing the evidence of geometry, for this is always quite\nindependent of such demonstration, which never proves anything we are not\nconvinced of already, through another kind of knowledge. So far then it is\nlike a cowardly soldier, who adds a wound to an enemy slain by another,\nand then boasts that he slew him himself.(22)\nAfter all this we hope there will be no doubt that the evidence of\nmathematics, which has become the pattern and symbol of all evidence,\nrests essentially not upon demonstration, but upon immediate perception,\nwhich is thus here, as everywhere else, the ultimate ground and source of\ntruth. Yet the perception which lies at the basis of mathematics has a\ngreat advantage over all other perception, and therefore over empirical\nperception. It is _a priori_, and therefore independent of experience,\nwhich is always given only in successive parts; therefore everything is\nequally near to it, and we can start either from the reason or from the\nconsequent, as we please. Now this makes it absolutely reliable, for in it\nthe consequent is known from the reason, and this is the only kind of\nknowledge that has necessity; for example, the equality of the sides is\nknown as established by the equality of the angles. All empirical\nperception, on the other hand, and the greater part of experience,\nproceeds conversely from the consequent to the reason, and this kind of\nknowledge is not infallible, for necessity only attaches to the consequent\non account of the reason being given, and no necessity attaches to the\nknowledge of the reason from the consequent, for the same consequent may\nfollow from different reasons. The latter kind of knowledge is simply\ninduction, _i.e._, from many consequents which point to one reason, the\nreason is accepted as certain; but as the cases can never be all before\nus, the truth here is not unconditionally certain. But all knowledge\nthrough sense-perception, and the great bulk of experience, has only this\nkind of truth. The affection of one of the senses induces the\nunderstanding to infer a cause of the effect, but, as a conclusion from\nthe consequent to the reason is never certain, illusion, which is\ndeception of the senses, is possible, and indeed often occurs, as was\npointed out above. Only when several of the senses, or it may be all the\nfive, receive impressions which point to the same cause, the possibility\nof illusion is reduced to a minimum; but yet it still exists, for there\nare cases, for example, the case of counterfeit money, in which all the\nsenses are deceived. All empirical knowledge, and consequently the whole\nof natural science, is in the same position, except only the pure, or as\nKant calls it, metaphysical part of it. Here also the causes are known\nfrom the effects, consequently all natural philosophy rests upon\nhypotheses, which are often false, and must then gradually give place to\nmore correct ones. Only in the case of purposely arranged experiments,\nknowledge proceeds from the cause to the effect, that is, it follows the\nmethod that affords certainty; but these experiments themselves are\nundertaken in consequence of hypotheses. Therefore, no branch of natural\nscience, such as physics, or astronomy, or physiology could be discovered\nall at once, as was the case with mathematics and logic, but required and\nrequires the collected and compared experiences of many centuries. In the\nfirst place, repeated confirmation in experience brings the induction,\nupon which the hypothesis rests, so near completeness that in practice it\ntakes the place of certainty, and is regarded as diminishing the value of\nthe hypothesis, its source, just as little as the incommensurability of\nstraight and curved lines diminishes the value of the application of\ngeometry, or that perfect exactness of the logarithm, which is not\nattainable, diminishes the value of arithmetic. For as the logarithm, or\nthe squaring of the circle, approaches infinitely near to correctness\nthrough infinite fractions, so, through manifold experience, the\ninduction, _i.e._, the knowledge of the cause from the effects,\napproaches, not infinitely indeed, but yet so near mathematical evidence,\n_i.e._, knowledge of the effects from the cause, that the possibility of\nmistake is small enough to be neglected, but yet the possibility exists;\nfor example, a conclusion from an indefinite number of cases to all cases,\n_i.e._, to the unknown ground on which all depend, is an induction. What\nconclusion of this kind seems more certain than that all men have the\nheart on the left side? Yet there are extremely rare and quite isolated\nexceptions of men who have the heart upon the right side. Sense-perception\nand empirical science have, therefore, the same kind of evidence. The\nadvantage which mathematics, pure natural science, and logic have over\nthem, as _a priori_ knowledge, rests merely upon this, that the formal\nelement in knowledge upon which all that is _a priori_ is based, is given\nas a whole and at once, and therefore in it we can always proceed from the\ncause to the effect, while in the former kind of knowledge we are\ngenerally obliged to proceed from the effect to the cause. In other\nrespects, the law of causality, or the principle of sufficient reason of\nchange, which guides empirical knowledge, is in itself just as certain as\nthe other forms of the principle of sufficient reason which are followed\nby the _a priori_ sciences referred to above. Logical demonstrations from\nconcepts or syllogisms have the advantage of proceeding from the reason to\nthe consequent, just as much as knowledge through perception _a priori_,\nand therefore in themselves, _i.e._, according to their form, they are\ninfallible. This has greatly assisted to bring demonstration in general\ninto such esteem. But this infallibility is merely relative; the\ndemonstration merely subsumes under the first principles of the science,\nand it is these which contain the whole material truth of science, and\nthey must not themselves be demonstrated, but must be founded on\nperception. In the few _a priori_ sciences we have named above, this\nperception is pure, but everywhere else it is empirical, and is only\nraised to universality through induction. If, then, in the empirical\nsciences also, the particular is proved from the general, yet the general,\non the other hand, has received its truth from the particular; it is only\na store of collected material, not a self-constituted foundation.\nSo much for the foundation of truth. Of the source and possibility of\nerror many explanations have been tried since Plato\u2019s metaphorical\nsolution of the dove-cot where the wrong pigeons are caught, &c.\n(The\u00e6tetus, p. 167, _et seq._) Kant\u2019s vague, indefinite explanation of the\nsource of error by means of the diagram of diagonal motion, will be found\nin the \u201cCritique of Pure Reason,\u201d p. 294 of the first edition, and p. 350\nof the fifth. As truth is the relation of a judgment to its ground of\nknowledge, it is always a problem how the person judging can believe that\nhe has such a ground of knowledge and yet not have it; that is to say, how\nerror, the deception of reason, is possible. I find this possibility quite\nanalogous to that of illusion, or the deception of the understanding,\nwhich has been explained above. My opinion is (and this is what gives this\nexplanation its proper place here) that _every error is an inference from\nthe consequent to the reason_, which indeed is valid when we know that the\nconsequent has that reason and can have no other; but otherwise is not\nvalid. The person who falls into error, either attributes to a consequent\na reason which it cannot have, in which case he shows actual deficiency of\nunderstanding, _i.e._, deficiency in the capacity for immediate knowledge\nof the connection between the cause and the effect, or, as more frequently\nhappens, he attributes to the effect a cause which is possible, but he\nadds to the major proposition of the syllogism, in which he infers the\ncause from the effect, that this effect _always_ results only from this\ncause. Now he could only be assured of this by a complete induction,\nwhich, however, he assumes without having made it. This \u201calways\u201d is\ntherefore too wide a concept, and instead of it he ought to have used\n\u201csometimes\u201d or \u201cgenerally.\u201d The conclusion would then be problematical,\nand therefore not erroneous. That the man who errs should proceed in this\nway is due either to haste, or to insufficient knowledge of what is\npossible, on account of which he does not know the necessity of the\ninduction that ought to be made. Error then is quite analogous to\nillusion. Both are inferences from the effect to the cause; the illusion\nbrought about always in accordance with the law of causality, and by the\nunderstanding alone, thus directly, in perception itself; the error in\naccordance with all the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, and\nby the reason, thus in thought itself; yet most commonly in accordance\nwith the law of causality, as will appear from the three following\nexamples, which may be taken as types or representatives of the three\nkinds of error. (1.) The illusion of the senses (deception of the\nunderstanding) induces error (deception of the reason); for example, if\none mistakes a painting for an alto-relief, and actually takes it for\nsuch; the error results from a conclusion from the following major\npremise: \u201cIf dark grey passes regularly through all shades to white; the\ncause is _always_ the light, which strikes differently upon projections\nand depressions, _ergo_\u2014.\u201d (2.) \u201cIf there is no money in my safe, the\ncause is _always_ that my servant has got a key for it: _ergo_\u2014.\u201d (3.) \u201cIf\na ray of sunlight, broken through a prism, _i.e._, bent up or down,\nappears as a coloured band instead of round and white as before, the cause\nmust always be that light consists of homogeneous rays, differently\ncoloured and refrangible to different degrees, which, when forced asunder\non account of the difference of their refrangibility, give an elongated\nand variously-coloured spectrum: _ergo\u2014bibamus!_\u201d\u2014It must be possible to\ntrace every error to such a conclusion, drawn from a major premise which\nis often only falsely generalised, hypothetical, and founded on the\nassumption that some particular cause is that of a certain effect. Only\ncertain mistakes in counting are to be excepted, and they are not really\nerrors, but merely mistakes. The operation prescribed by the concepts of\nthe numbers has not been carried out in pure intuition or perception, in\ncounting, but some other operation instead of it.\nAs regards the _content_ of the sciences generally, it is, in fact, always\nthe relation of the phenomena of the world to each other, according to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, under the guidance of the _why_, which has\nvalidity and meaning only through this principle. _Explanation_ is the\nestablishment of this relation. Therefore explanation can never go further\nthan to show two ideas standing to each other in the relation peculiar to\nthat form of the principle of sufficient reason which reigns in the class\nto which they belong. If this is done we cannot further be asked the\nquestion, _why_: for the relation proved is that one which absolutely\ncannot be imagined as other than it is, _i.e._, it is the form of all\nknowledge. Therefore we do not ask why 2 + 2 = 4; or why the equality of\nthe angles of a triangle determines the equality of the sides; or why its\neffect follows any given cause; or why the truth of the conclusion is\nevident from the truth of the premises. Every explanation which does not\nultimately lead to a relation of which no \u201cwhy\u201d can further be demanded,\nstops at an accepted _qualitas occulta_; but this is the character of\nevery original force of nature. Every explanation in natural science must\nultimately end with such a _qualitas occulta_, and thus with complete\nobscurity. It must leave the inner nature of a stone just as much\nunexplained as that of a human being; it can give as little account of the\nweight, the cohesion, the chemical qualities, &c., of the former, as of\nthe knowing and acting of the latter. Thus, for example, weight is a\n_qualitas occulta_, for it can be thought away, and does not proceed as a\nnecessity from the form of knowledge; which, on the contrary, is not the\ncase with the law of inertia, for it follows from the law of causality,\nand is therefore sufficiently explained if it is referred to that law.\nThere are two things which are altogether inexplicable,\u2014that is to say, do\nnot ultimately lead to the relation which the principle of sufficient\nreason expresses. These are, first, the principle of sufficient reason\nitself in all its four forms, because it is the principle of all\nexplanation, which has meaning only in relation to it; secondly, that to\nwhich this principle does not extend, but which is the original source of\nall phenomena; the thing-in-itself, the knowledge of which is not subject\nto the principle of sufficient reason. We must be content for the present\nnot to understand this thing-in-itself, for it can only be made\nintelligible by means of the following book, in which we shall resume this\nconsideration of the possible achievements of the sciences. But at the\npoint at which natural science, and indeed every science, leaves things,\nbecause not only its explanation of them, but even the principle of this\nexplanation, the principle of sufficient reason, does not extend beyond\nthis point; there philosophy takes them up and treats them after its own\nmethod, which is quite distinct from the method of science. In my essay on\nthe principle of sufficient reason, \u00a7 51, I have shown how in the\ndifferent sciences the chief guiding clue is one or other form of that\nprinciple; and, in fact, perhaps the most appropriate classification of\nthe sciences might be based upon this circumstance. Every explanation\narrived at by the help of this clue is, as we have said, merely relative;\nit explains things in relation to each other, but something which indeed\nis presupposed is always left unexplained. In mathematics, for example,\nthis is space and time; in mechanics, physics, and chemistry it is matter,\nqualities, original forces and laws of nature; in botany and zoology it is\nthe difference of species, and life itself; in history it is the human\nrace with all its properties of thought and will: in all it is that form\nof the principle of sufficient reason which is respectively applicable. It\nis peculiar to _philosophy_ that it presupposes nothing as known, but\ntreats everything as equally external and a problem; not merely the\nrelations of phenomena, but also the phenomena themselves, and even the\nprinciple of sufficient reason to which the other sciences are content to\nrefer everything. In philosophy nothing would be gained by such a\nreference, as one member of the series is just as external to it as\nanother; and, moreover, that kind of connection is just as much a problem\nfor philosophy as what is joined together by it, and the latter again is\njust as much a problem after its combination has been explained as before\nit. For, as we have said, just what the sciences presuppose and lay down\nas the basis and the limits of their explanation, is precisely and\npeculiarly the problem of philosophy, which may therefore be said to begin\nwhere science ends. It cannot be founded upon demonstrations, for they\nlead from known principles to unknown, but everything is equally unknown\nand external to philosophy. There can be no principle in consequence of\nwhich the world with all its phenomena first came into existence, and\ntherefore it is not possible to construct, as Spinoza wished, a philosophy\nwhich demonstrates _ex firmis principiis_. Philosophy is the most general\nrational knowledge, the first principles of which cannot therefore be\nderived from another principle still more general. The principle of\ncontradiction establishes merely the agreement of concepts, but does not\nitself produce concepts. The principle of sufficient reason explains the\nconnections of phenomena, but not the phenomena themselves; therefore\nphilosophy cannot proceed upon these principles to seek a _causa\nefficiens_ or a _causa finalis_ of the whole world. My philosophy, at\nleast, does not by any means seek to know _whence_ or _wherefore_ the\nworld exists, but merely _what_ the world is. But the _why_ is here\nsubordinated to the _what_, for it already belongs to the world, as it\narises and has meaning and validity only through the form of its\nphenomena, the principle of sufficient reason. We might indeed say that\nevery one knows what the world is without help, for he is himself that\nsubject of knowledge of which the world is the idea; and so far this would\nbe true. But that knowledge is empirical, is in the concrete; the task of\nphilosophy is to reproduce this in the abstract to raise to permanent\nrational knowledge the successive changing perceptions, and in general,\nall that is contained under the wide concept of feeling and merely\nnegatively defined as not abstract, distinct, rational knowledge. It must\ntherefore consist of a statement in the abstract, of the nature of the\nwhole world, of the whole, and of all the parts. In order then that it may\nnot lose itself in the endless multitude of particular judgments, it must\nmake use of abstraction and think everything individual in the universal,\nand its differences also in the universal. It must therefore partly\nseparate and partly unite, in order to present to rational knowledge the\nwhole manifold of the world generally, according to its nature,\ncomprehended in a few abstract concepts. Through these concepts, in which\nit fixes the nature of the world, the whole individual must be known as\nwell as the universal, the knowledge of both therefore must be bound\ntogether to the minutest point. Therefore the capacity for philosophy\nconsists just in that in which Plato placed it, the knowledge of the one\nin the many, and the many in the one. Philosophy will therefore be a\nsum-total of general judgments, whose ground of knowledge is immediately\nthe world itself in its entirety, without excepting anything; thus all\nthat is to be found in human consciousness; it will be _a complete\nrecapitulation, as it were, a reflection, of the world in abstract\nconcepts_, which is only possible by the union of the essentially\nidentical in _one_ concept and the relegation of the different to another.\nThis task was already prescribed to philosophy by Bacon of Verulam when he\nsaid: _ea demum vera est philosophia, quae mundi ipsius voces fidelissime\nreddit, et veluti dictante mundo conscripta est, et nihil aliud est, quam\nejusdem_ SIMULACRUM ET REFLECTIO, _neque addit quidquam de proprio, sed\ntantum iterat et resonat_ (De Augm. Scient., L. 2, c. 13). But we take\nthis in a wider sense than Bacon could then conceive.\nThe agreement which all the sides and parts of the world have with each\nother, just because they belong to a whole, must also be found in this\nabstract copy of it. Therefore the judgments in this sum-total could to a\ncertain extent be deduced from each other, and indeed always reciprocally\nso deduced. Yet to make the first judgment possible, they must all be\npresent, and thus implied as prior to it in the knowledge of the world in\nthe concrete, especially as all direct proof is more certain than indirect\nproof; their harmony with each other by virtue of which they come together\ninto the unity of _one_ thought, and which arises from the harmony and\nunity of the world of perception itself, which is their common ground of\nknowledge, is not therefore to be made use of to establish them, as that\nwhich is prior to them, but is only added as a confirmation of their\ntruth. This problem itself can only become quite clear in being\nsolved.(23)\n\u00a7 16. After this full consideration of reason as a special faculty of\nknowledge belonging to man alone, and the results and phenomena peculiar\nto human nature brought about by it, it still remains for me to speak of\nreason, so far as it is the guide of human action, and in this respect may\nbe called _practical_. But what there is to say upon this point has found\nits place elsewhere in the appendix to this work, where I controvert the\nexistence of the so-called practical reason of Kant, which he (certainly\nvery conveniently) explained as the immediate source of virtue, and as the\nseat of an absolute (_i.e._, fallen from heaven) imperative. The detailed\nand thorough refutation of this Kantian principle of morality I have given\nlater in the \u201cFundamental Problems of Ethics.\u201d There remains, therefore,\nbut little for me to say here about the actual influence of reason, in the\ntrue sense of the word, upon action. At the commencement of our treatment\nof reason we remarked, in general terms, how much the action and behaviour\nof men differs from that of brutes, and that this difference is to be\nregarded as entirely due to the presence of abstract concepts in\nconsciousness. The influence of these upon our whole existence is so\npenetrating and significant that, on account of them, we are related to\nthe lower animals very much as those animals that see are related to those\nthat have no eyes (certain larvae, worms, and zoophytes). Animals without\neyes know only by touch what is immediately present to them in space, what\ncomes into contact with them; those which see, on the contrary, know a\nwide circle of near and distant objects. In the same way the absence of\nreason confines the lower animals to the ideas of perception, _i.e._, the\nreal objects which are immediately present to them in time; we, on the\ncontrary, on account of knowledge in the abstract, comprehend not only the\nnarrow actual present, but also the whole past and future, and the wide\nsphere of the possible; we view life freely on all its sides, and go far\nbeyond the present and the actual. Thus what the eye is in space and for\nsensuous knowledge, reason is, to a certain extent, in time and for inner\nknowledge. But as the visibility of objects has its worth and meaning only\nin the fact that it informs us of their tangibility, so the whole worth of\nabstract knowledge always consists in its relation to what is perceived.\nTherefore men naturally attach far more worth to immediate and perceived\nknowledge than to abstract concepts, to that which is merely thought; they\nplace empirical knowledge before logical. But this is not the opinion of\nmen who live more in words than in deeds, who have seen more on paper and\nin books than in actual life, and who in their greatest degeneracy become\npedants and lovers of the mere letter. Thus only is it conceivable that\nLeibnitz and Wolf and all their successors could go so far astray as to\nexplain knowledge of perception, after the example of Duns Scotus, as\nmerely confused abstract knowledge! To the honour of Spinoza, I must\nmention that his truer sense led him, on the contrary, to explain all\ngeneral concepts as having arisen from the confusion of that which was\nknown in perception (Eth. II., prop. 40, Schol. 1). It is also a result of\nperverted opinion that in mathematics the evidence proper to it was\nrejected, and logical evidence alone accepted; that everything in general\nwhich was not abstract knowledge was comprehended under the wide name of\nfeeling, and consequently was little valued; and lastly that the Kantian\nethics regarded the good will which immediately asserts itself upon\nknowledge of the circumstances, and guides to right and good action as\nmere feeling and emotion, and consequently as worthless and without merit,\nand would only recognise actions which proceed from abstract maxims as\nhaving moral worth.\nThe many-sided view of life as a whole which man, as distinguished from\nthe lower animals, possesses through reason, may be compared to a\ngeometrical, colourless, abstract, reduced plan of his actual life. He,\ntherefore, stands to the lower animals as the navigator who, by means of\nchart, compass, and quadrant, knows accurately his course and his position\nat any time upon the sea, stands to the uneducated sailors who see only\nthe waves and the heavens. Thus it is worth noticing, and indeed\nwonderful, how, besides his life in the concrete, man always lives another\nlife in the abstract. In the former he is given as a prey to all the\nstorms of actual life, and to the influence of the present; he must\nstruggle, suffer, and die like the brute. But his life in the abstract, as\nit lies before his rational consciousness, is the still reflection of the\nformer, and of the world in which he lives; it is just that reduced chart\nor plan to which we have referred. Here in the sphere of quiet\ndeliberation, what completely possessed him and moved him intensely\nbefore, appears to him cold, colourless, and for the moment external to\nhim; he is merely the spectator, the observer. In respect of this\nwithdrawal into reflection he may be compared to an actor who has played\nhis part in one scene, and who takes his place among the audience till it\nis time for him to go upon the stage again, and quietly looks on at\nwhatever may happen, even though it be the preparation for his own death\n(in the piece), but afterwards he again goes on the stage and acts and\nsuffers as he must. From this double life proceeds that quietness peculiar\nto human beings, so very different from the thoughtlessness of the brutes,\nand with which, in accordance with previous reflection, or a formed\ndetermination, or a recognised necessity, a man suffers or accomplishes in\ncold blood, what is of the utmost and often terrible importance to him;\nsuicide, execution, the duel, enterprises of every kind fraught with\ndanger to life, and, in general, things against which his whole animal\nnature rebels. Under such circumstances we see to what an extent reason\nhas mastered the animal nature, and we say to the strong: \u03c3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03bd\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\n\u1f21\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1! (_ferreum certe tibi cor_), Il. 24, 521. Here we can say truly that\nreason manifests itself practically, and thus wherever action is guided by\nreason, where the motives are abstract concepts, wherever we are not\ndetermined by particular ideas of perception, nor by the impression of the\nmoment which guides the brutes, there _practical reason_ shows itself. But\nI have fully explained in the Appendix, and illustrated by examples, that\nthis is entirely different from and unrelated to the ethical worth of\nactions; that rational action and virtuous action are two entirely\ndifferent things; that reason may just as well find itself in connection\nwith great evil as with great good, and by its assistance may give great\npower to the one as well as to the other; that it is equally ready and\nvaluable for the methodical and consistent carrying out of the noble and\nof the bad intention, of the wise as of the foolish maxim; which all\nresults from the constitution of its nature, which is feminine, receptive,\nretentive, and not spontaneous; all this I have shown in detail in the\nAppendix, and illustrated by examples. What is said there would have been\nplaced here, but on account of my polemic against Kant\u2019s pretended\npractical reason I have been obliged to relegate it to the Appendix, to\nwhich I therefore refer.\nThe ideal explained in the _Stoical philosophy_ is the most complete\ndevelopment of _practical reason_ in the true and genuine sense of the\nword; it is the highest summit to which man can attain by the mere use of\nhis reason, and in it his difference from the brutes shows itself most\ndistinctly. For the ethics of Stoicism are originally and essentially, not\na doctrine of virtue, but merely a guide to a rational life, the end and\naim of which is happiness through peace of mind. Virtuous conduct appears\nin it as it were merely by accident, as the means, not as the end.\nTherefore the ethical theory of Stoicism is in its whole nature and point\nof view fundamentally different from the ethical systems which lay stress\ndirectly upon virtue, such as the doctrines of the Vedas, of Plato, of\nChristianity, and of Kant. The aim of Stoical ethics is happiness: \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\n\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (_virtutes omnes finem habere beatitudinem_) it is called\nin the account of the Stoa by Stob\u00e6us (Ecl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 114, and also\np. 138). Yet the ethics of Stoicism teach that happiness can only be\nattained with certainty through inward peace and quietness of spirit\n(\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1), and that this again can only be reached through virtue; this\nis the whole meaning of the saying that virtue is the highest good. But if\nindeed by degrees the end is lost sight of in the means, and virtue is\ninculcated in a way which discloses an interest entirely different from\nthat of one\u2019s own happiness, for it contradicts this too distinctly; this\nis just one of those inconsistencies by means of which, in every system,\nthe immediately known, or, as it is called, felt truth leads us back to\nthe right way in defiance of syllogistic reasoning; as, for example, we\nsee clearly in the ethical teaching of Spinoza, which deduces a pure\ndoctrine of virtue from the egoistical _suum utile qu\u00e6rere_ by means of\npalpable sophisms. According to this, as I conceive the spirit of the\nStoical ethics, their source lies in the question whether the great\nprerogative of man, reason, which, by means of planned action and its\nresults, relieves life and its burdens so much, might not also be capable\nof freeing him at once, directly, _i.e._, through mere knowledge,\ncompletely, or nearly so, of the sorrows and miseries of every kind of\nwhich his life is full. They held that it was not in keeping with the\nprerogative of reason that the nature given with it, which by means of it\ncomprehends and contemplates an infinity of things and circumstances,\nshould yet, through the present, and the accidents that can be contained\nin the few years of a life that is short, fleeting, and uncertain, be\nexposed to such intense pain, to such great anxiety and suffering, as\narise from the tempestuous strain of the desires and the antipathies; and\nthey believed that the due application of reason must raise men above\nthem, and can make them invulnerable. Therefore Antisthenes says: \u0394\u03b5\u03b9\n\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03b7 \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd (_aut mentem parandam, aut laqueum._ Plut. de\nstoic. repugn., c. 14), _i.e._, life is so full of troubles and vexations,\nthat one must either rise above it by means of corrected thoughts, or\nleave it. It was seen that want and suffering did not directly and of\nnecessity spring from not having, but from desiring to have and not\nhaving; that therefore this desire to have is the necessary condition\nunder which alone it becomes a privation not to have and begets pain. \u039f\u03c5\n\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 (_non paupertas dolorem efficit, sed\ncupiditas_), Epict., fragm. 25. Men learned also from experience that it\nis only the hope of what is claimed that begets and nourishes the wish;\ntherefore neither the many unavoidable evils which are common to all, nor\nunattainable blessings, disquiet or trouble us, but only the trifling more\nor less of those things which we can avoid or attain; indeed, not only\nwhat is absolutely unavoidable or unattainable, but also what is merely\nrelatively so, leaves us quite undisturbed; therefore the ills that have\nonce become joined to our individuality, or the good things that must of\nnecessity always be denied us, are treated with indifference, in\naccordance with the peculiarity of human nature that every wish soon dies\nand can no more beget pain if it is not nourished by hope. It followed\nfrom all this that happiness always depends upon the proportion between\nour claims and what we receive. It is all one whether the quantities thus\nrelated be great or small, and the proportion can be established just as\nwell by diminishing the amount of the first as by increasing the amount of\nthe second; and in the same way it also follows that all suffering\nproceeds from the want of proportion between what we demand and expect and\nwhat we get. Now this want of proportion obviously lies only in knowledge,\nand it could be entirely abolished through fuller insight.(24) Therefore\nChrysippus says: \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b6\u1fc3\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd (Stob.\nEcl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 134), that is, one ought to live with a due\nknowledge of the transitory nature of the things of the world. For as\noften as a man loses self-command, or is struck down by a misfortune, or\ngrows angry, or becomes faint-hearted, he shows that he finds things\ndifferent from what he expected, consequently that he was caught in error,\nand did not know the world and life, did not know that the will of the\nindividual is crossed at every step by the chance of inanimate nature and\nthe antagonism of aims and the wickedness of other individuals: he has\ntherefore either not made use of his reason in order to arrive at a\ngeneral knowledge of this characteristic of life, or he lacks judgment, in\nthat he does not recognise in the particular what he knows in general, and\nis therefore surprised by it and loses his self-command.(25) Thus also\nevery keen pleasure is an error and an illusion, for no attained wish can\ngive lasting satisfaction; and, moreover, every possession and every\nhappiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time, and may therefore\nbe demanded back the next hour. All pain rests on the passing away of such\nan illusion; thus both arise from defective knowledge; the wise man\ntherefore holds himself equally aloof from joy and sorrow, and no event\ndisturbs his \u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1.\nIn accordance with this spirit and aim of the Stoa, Epictetus began and\nended with the doctrine as the kernel of his philosophy, that we should\nconsider well and distinguish what depends upon us and what does not, and\ntherefore entirely avoid counting upon the latter, whereby we shall\ncertainly remain free from all pain, sorrow, and anxiety. But that which\nalone is dependent upon us is the will; and here a transition gradually\ntakes place to a doctrine of virtue, for it is observed that as the outer\nworld, which is independent of us, determines good and bad fortune, so\ninner contentment with ourselves, or the absence of it, proceeds from the\nwill. But it was then asked whether we ought to apply the words _bonum_\nand _malum_ to the two former or to the two latter? This was indeed\narbitrary and a matter of choice, and did not make any real difference,\nbut yet the Stoics disputed everlastingly with the Peripatetics and\nEpicureans about it, and amused themselves with the inadmissible\ncomparison of two entirely incommensurable quantities, and the\nantithetical, paradoxical judgments which proceeded from them, and which\nthey flung at each other. The _Paradoxa_ of Cicero afford us an\ninteresting collection of these from the Stoical side.\nZeno, the founder, seems originally to have followed a somewhat different\npath. The starting-point with him was that for the attainment of the\nhighest good, _i.e._, blessedness and spiritual peace, one must live in\nharmony with oneself (\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03be\u1fc3\u03bd; \u03b4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f11\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\n\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03be\u1fc3\u03bd.\u2014_Consonanter vivere: hoc est secundum unam rationem et\nconcordem sibi vivere._ Stob.

They\ntherefore gave it material content by the addition\u2014\u201cto live in harmony\nwith nature\u201d (\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b6\u1fc3\u03bd), which, as Stob\u00e6us mentions in\nanother place, was first added by Kleanthes, and extended the matter very\nmuch on account of the wide sphere of the concept and the vagueness of the\nexpression. For Kleanthes meant the whole of nature in general, while\nChrysippus meant human nature in particular (Diog. Laert., 7, 89). It\nfollowed that what alone was adapted to the latter was virtue, just as the\nsatisfaction of animal desires was adapted to animal natures; and thus\nethics had again to be forcibly united to a doctrine of virtue, and in\nsome way or other established through physics. For the Stoics always aimed\nat unity of principle, as for them God and the world were not dissevered.\nThe ethical system of Stoicism, regarded as a whole, is in fact a very\nvaluable and estimable attempt to use the great prerogative of man,\nreason, for an important and salutary end; to raise him above the\nsuffering and pain to which all life is exposed, by means of a maxim\u2014\n\u201c_Qua ratione queas traducere leniter \u0153vum:_\n_Ne te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,_\n_Ne pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spes,_\u201d\nand thus to make him partake, in the highest degree, of the dignity which\nbelongs to him as a rational being, as distinguished from the brutes; a\ndignity of which, in this sense at any rate, we can speak, though not in\nany other. It is a consequence of my view of the ethical system of\nStoicism that it must be explained at the part of my work at which I\nconsider what reason is and what it can do. But although it may to a\ncertain extent be possible to attain that end through the application of\nreason, and through a purely rational system of ethics, and although\nexperience shows that the happiest men are those purely rational\ncharacters commonly called practical philosophers,\u2014and rightly so, because\njust as the true, that is, the theoretical philosopher carries life into\nthe concept, they carry the concept into life,\u2014yet it is far from the case\nthat perfection can be attained in this way, and that the reason, rightly\nused, can really free us from the burden and sorrow of life, and lead us\nto happiness. Rather, there lies an absolute contradiction in wishing to\nlive without suffering, and this contradiction is also implied in the\ncommonly used expression, \u201cblessed life.\u201d This will become perfectly clear\nto whoever comprehends the whole of the following exposition. In this\npurely rational system of ethics the contradiction reveals itself thus,\nthe Stoic is obliged in his doctrine of the way to the blessed life (for\nthat is what his ethical system always remains) to insert a recommendation\nof suicide (as among the magnificent ornaments and apparel of Eastern\ndespots there is always a costly vial of poison) for the case in which the\nsufferings of the body, which cannot be philosophised away by any\nprinciples or syllogistic reasonings, are paramount and incurable; thus\nits one aim, blessedness, is rendered vain, and nothing remains as a mode\nof escape from suffering except death; in such a case then death must be\nvoluntarily accepted, just as we would take any other medicine. Here then\na marked antagonism is brought out between the ethical system of Stoicism\nand all those systems referred to above which make virtue in itself\ndirectly, and accompanied by the most grievous sorrows, their aim, and\nwill not allow a man to end his life in order to escape from suffering.\nNot one of them, however, was able to give the true reason for the\nrejection of suicide, but they laboriously collected illusory explanations\nfrom all sides: the true reason will appear in the Fourth Book in the\ncourse of the development of our system. But the antagonism referred to\nreveals and establishes the essential difference in fundamental principle\nbetween Stoicism, which is just a special form of end\u00e6monism, and those\ndoctrines we have mentioned, although both are often at one in their\nresults, and are apparently related. And the inner contradiction referred\nto above, with which the ethical system of Stoicism is affected even in\nits fundamental thought, shows itself further in the circumstance that its\nideal, the Stoic philosopher, as the system itself represents him, could\nnever obtain life or inner poetic truth, but remains a wooden, stiff\nlay-figure of which nothing can be made. He cannot himself make use of his\nwisdom, and his perfect peace, contentment, and blessedness directly\ncontradict the nature of man, and preclude us from forming any concrete\nidea of him. When compared with him, how entirely different appear the\novercomers of the world, and voluntary hermits that Indian philosophy\npresents to us, and has actually produced; or indeed, the holy man of\nChristianity, that excellent form full of deep life, of the greatest\npoetic truth, and the highest significance, which stands before us in\nperfect virtue, holiness, and sublimity, yet in a state of supreme\nsuffering.(26)\nSECOND BOOK. THE WORLD AS WILL.\nFirst Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will.\nNos habitat, non tartara, sed nec sidera coeli:\nSpiritus, in nobis qui viget, illa facit.\n\u00a7 17. In the first book we considered the idea merely as such, that is,\nonly according to its general form. It is true that as far as the abstract\nidea, the concept, is concerned, we obtained a knowledge of it in respect\nof its content also, because it has content and meaning only in relation\nto the idea of perception, without which it would be worthless and empty.\nAccordingly, directing our attention exclusively to the idea of\nperception, we shall now endeavour to arrive at a knowledge of its\ncontent, its more exact definition, and the forms which it presents to us.\nAnd it will specially interest us to find an explanation of its peculiar\nsignificance, that significance which is otherwise merely felt, but on\naccount of which it is that these pictures do not pass by us entirely\nstrange and meaningless, as they must otherwise do, but speak to us\ndirectly, are understood, and obtain an interest which concerns our whole\nnature.\nWe direct our attention to mathematics, natural science, and philosophy,\nfor each of these holds out the hope that it will afford us a part of the\nexplanation we desire. Now, taking philosophy first, we find that it is\nlike a monster with many heads, each of which speaks a different language.\nThey are not, indeed, all at variance on the point we are here\nconsidering, the significance of the idea of perception. For, with the\nexception of the Sceptics and the Idealists, the others, for the most\npart, speak very much in the same way of an _object_ which constitutes the\n_basis_ of the idea, and which is indeed different in its whole being and\nnature from the idea, but yet is in all points as like it as one egg is to\nanother. But this does not help us, for we are quite unable to distinguish\nsuch an object from the idea; we find that they are one and the same; for\nevery object always and for ever presupposes a subject, and therefore\nremains idea, so that we recognised objectivity as belonging to the most\nuniversal form of the idea, which is the division into subject and object.\nFurther, the principle of sufficient reason, which is referred to in\nsupport of this doctrine, is for us merely the form of the idea, the\norderly combination of one idea with another, but not the combination of\nthe whole finite or infinite series of ideas with something which is not\nidea at all, and which cannot therefore be presented in perception. Of the\nSceptics and Idealists we spoke above, in examining the controversy about\nthe reality of the outer world.\nIf we turn to mathematics to look for the fuller knowledge we desire of\nthe idea of perception, which we have, as yet, only understood generally,\nmerely in its form, we find that mathematics only treats of these ideas so\nfar as they fill time and space, that is, so far as they are quantities.\nIt will tell us with the greatest accuracy the how-many and the how-much;\nbut as this is always merely relative, that is to say, merely a comparison\nof one idea with others, and a comparison only in the one respect of\nquantity, this also is not the information we are principally in search\nof.\nLastly, if we turn to the wide province of natural science, which is\ndivided into many fields, we may, in the first place, make a general\ndivision of it into two parts. It is either the description of forms,\nwhich I call _Morphology_, or the explanation of changes, which I call\n_Etiology_. The first treats of the permanent forms, the second of the\nchanging matter, according to the laws of its transition from one form to\nanother. The first is the whole extent of what is generally called natural\nhistory. It teaches us, especially in the sciences of botany and zoology,\nthe various permanent, organised, and therefore definitely determined\nforms in the constant change of individuals; and these forms constitute a\ngreat part of the content of the idea of perception. In natural history\nthey are classified, separated, united, arranged according to natural and\nartificial systems, and brought under concepts which make a general view\nand knowledge of the whole of them possible. Further, an infinitely fine\nanalogy both in the whole and in the parts of these forms, and running\nthrough them all (_unit\u00e9 de plan_), is established, and thus they may be\ncompared to innumerable variations on a theme which is not given. The\npassage of matter into these forms, that is to say, the origin of\nindividuals, is not a special part of natural science, for every\nindividual springs from its like by generation, which is everywhere\nequally mysterious, and has as yet evaded definite knowledge. The little\nthat is known on the subject finds its place in physiology, which belongs\nto that part of natural science I have called etiology. Mineralogy also,\nespecially where it becomes geology, inclines towards etiology, though it\nprincipally belongs to morphology. Etiology proper comprehends all those\nbranches of natural science in which the chief concern is the knowledge of\ncause and effect. The sciences teach how, according to an invariable rule,\none condition of matter is necessarily followed by a certain other\ncondition; how one change necessarily conditions and brings about a\ncertain other change; this sort of teaching is called _explanation_. The\nprincipal sciences in this department are mechanics, physics, chemistry,\nand physiology.\nIf, however, we surrender ourselves to its teaching, we soon become\nconvinced that etiology cannot afford us the information we chiefly\ndesire, any more than morphology. The latter presents to us innumerable\nand infinitely varied forms, which are yet related by an unmistakable\nfamily likeness. These are for us ideas, and when only treated in this\nway, they remain always strange to us, and stand before us like\nhieroglyphics which we do not understand. Etiology, on the other hand,\nteaches us that, according to the law of cause and effect, this particular\ncondition of matter brings about that other particular condition, and thus\nit has explained it and performed its part. However, it really does\nnothing more than indicate the orderly arrangement according to which the\nstates of matter appear in space and time, and teach in all cases what\nphenomenon must necessarily appear at a particular time in a particular\nplace. It thus determines the position of phenomena in time and space,\naccording to a law whose special content is derived from experience, but\nwhose universal form and necessity is yet known to us independently of\nexperience. But it affords us absolutely no information about the inner\nnature of any one of these phenomena: this is called a _force of nature_,\nand it lies outside the province of causal explanation, which calls the\nconstant uniformity with which manifestations of such a force appear\nwhenever their known conditions are present, a _law of nature_. But this\nlaw of nature, these conditions, and this appearance in a particular place\nat a particular time, are all that it knows or ever can know. The force\nitself which manifests itself, the inner nature of the phenomena which\nappear in accordance with these laws, remains always a secret to it,\nsomething entirely strange and unknown in the case of the simplest as well\nas of the most complex phenomena. For although as yet etiology has most\ncompletely achieved its aim in mechanics, and least completely in\nphysiology, still the force on account of which a stone falls to the\nground or one body repels another is, in its inner nature, not less\nstrange and mysterious than that which produces the movements and the\ngrowth of an animal. The science of mechanics presupposes matter, weight,\nimpenetrability, the possibility of communicating motion by impact,\ninertia and so forth as ultimate facts, calls them forces of nature, and\ntheir necessary and orderly appearance under certain conditions a law of\nnature. Only after this does its explanation begin, and it consists in\nindicating truly and with mathematical exactness, how, where and when each\nforce manifests itself, and in referring every phenomenon which presents\nitself to the operation of one of these forces. Physics, chemistry, and\nphysiology proceed in the same way in their province, only they presuppose\nmore and accomplish less. Consequently the most complete etiological\nexplanation of the whole of nature can never be more than an enumeration\nof forces which cannot be explained, and a reliable statement of the rule\naccording to which phenomena appear in time and space, succeed, and make\nway for each other. But the inner nature of the forces which thus appear\nremains unexplained by such an explanation, which must confine itself to\nphenomena and their arrangement, because the law which it follows does not\nextend further. In this respect it may be compared to a section of a piece\nof marble which shows many veins beside each other, but does not allow us\nto trace the course of the veins from the interior of the marble to its\nsurface. Or, if I may use an absurd but more striking comparison, the\nphilosophical investigator must always have the same feeling towards the\ncomplete etiology of the whole of nature, as a man who, without knowing\nhow, has been brought into a company quite unknown to him, each member of\nwhich in turn presents another to him as his friend and cousin, and\ntherefore as quite well known, and yet the man himself, while at each\nintroduction he expresses himself gratified, has always the question on\nhis lips: \u201cBut how the deuce do I stand to the whole company?\u201d\nThus we see that, with regard to those phenomena which we know only as our\nideas, etiology can never give us the desired information that shall carry\nus beyond this point. For, after all its explanations, they still remain\nquite strange to us, as mere ideas whose significance we do not\nunderstand. The causal connection merely gives us the rule and the\nrelative order of their appearance in space and time, but affords us no\nfurther knowledge of that which so appears. Moreover, the law of causality\nitself has only validity for ideas, for objects of a definite class, and\nit has meaning only in so far as it presupposes them. Thus, like these\nobjects themselves, it always exists only in relation to a subject, that\nis, conditionally; and so it is known just as well if we start from the\nsubject, _i.e._, _a priori_, as if we start from the object, _i.e._, _a\nposteriori_. Kant indeed has taught us this.\nBut what now impels us to inquiry is just that we are not satisfied with\nknowing that we have ideas, that they are such and such, and that they are\nconnected according to certain laws, the general expression of which is\nthe principle of sufficient reason. We wish to know the significance of\nthese ideas; we ask whether this world is merely idea; in which case it\nwould pass by us like an empty dream or a baseless vision, not worth our\nnotice; or whether it is also something else, something more than idea,\nand if so, what. Thus much is certain, that this something we seek for\nmust be completely and in its whole nature different from the idea; that\nthe forms and laws of the idea must therefore be completely foreign to it;\nfurther, that we cannot arrive at it from the idea under the guidance of\nthe laws which merely combine objects, ideas, among themselves, and which\nare the forms of the principle of sufficient reason.\nThus we see already that we can never arrive at the real nature of things\nfrom without. However much we investigate, we can never reach anything but\nimages and names. We are like a man who goes round a castle seeking in\nvain for an entrance, and sometimes sketching the fa\u00e7ades. And yet this is\nthe method that has been followed by all philosophers before me.\n\u00a7 18. In fact, the meaning for which we seek of that world which is\npresent to us only as our idea, or the transition from the world as mere\nidea of the knowing subject to whatever it may be besides this, would\nnever be found if the investigator himself were nothing more than the pure\nknowing subject (a winged cherub without a body). But he is himself rooted\nin that world; he finds himself in it as an _individual_, that is to say,\nhis knowledge, which is the necessary supporter of the whole world as\nidea, is yet always given through the medium of a body, whose affections\nare, as we have shown, the starting-point for the understanding in the\nperception of that world. His body is, for the pure knowing subject, an\nidea like every other idea, an object among objects. Its movements and\nactions are so far known to him in precisely the same way as the changes\nof all other perceived objects, and would be just as strange and\nincomprehensible to him if their meaning were not explained for him in an\nentirely different way. Otherwise he would see his actions follow upon\ngiven motives with the constancy of a law of nature, just as the changes\nof other objects follow upon causes, stimuli, or motives. But he would not\nunderstand the influence of the motives any more than the connection\nbetween every other effect which he sees and its cause. He would then call\nthe inner nature of these manifestations and actions of his body which he\ndid not understand a force, a quality, or a character, as he pleased, but\nhe would have no further insight into it. But all this is not the case;\nindeed the answer to the riddle is given to the subject of knowledge who\nappears as an individual, and the answer is _will_. This and this alone\ngives him the key to his own existence, reveals to him the significance,\nshows him the inner mechanism of his being, of his action, of his\nmovements. The body is given in two entirely different ways to the subject\nof knowledge, who becomes an individual only through his identity with it.\nIt is given as an idea in intelligent perception, as an object among\nobjects and subject to the laws of objects. And it is also given in quite\na different way as that which is immediately known to every one, and is\nsignified by the word _will_. Every true act of his will is also at once\nand without exception a movement of his body. The act of will and the\nmovement of the body are not two different things objectively known, which\nthe bond of causality unites; they do not stand in the relation of cause\nand effect; they are one and the same, but they are given in entirely\ndifferent ways,\u2014immediately, and again in perception for the\nunderstanding. The action of the body is nothing but the act of the will\nobjectified, _i.e._, passed into perception. It will appear later that\nthis is true of every movement of the body, not merely those which follow\nupon motives, but also involuntary movements which follow upon mere\nstimuli, and, indeed, that the whole body is nothing but objectified will,\n_i.e._, will become idea. All this will be proved and made quite clear in\nthe course of this work. In one respect, therefore, I shall call the body\nthe _objectivity of will_; as in the previous book, and in the essay on\nthe principle of sufficient reason, in accordance with the one-sided point\nof view intentionally adopted there (that of the idea), I called it _the\nimmediate object_. Thus in a certain sense we may also say that will is\nthe knowledge _a priori_ of the body, and the body is the knowledge _a\nposteriori_ of the will. Resolutions of the will which relate to the\nfuture are merely deliberations of the reason about what we shall will at\na particular time, not real acts of will. Only the carrying out of the\nresolve stamps it as will, for till then it is never more than an\nintention that may be changed, and that exists only in the reason _in\nabstracto_. It is only in reflection that to will and to act are\ndifferent; in reality they are one. Every true, genuine, immediate act of\nwill is also, at once and immediately, a visible act of the body. And,\ncorresponding to this, every impression upon the body is also, on the\nother hand, at once and immediately an impression upon the will. As such\nit is called pain when it is opposed to the will; gratification or\npleasure when it is in accordance with it. The degrees of both are widely\ndifferent. It is quite wrong, however, to call pain and pleasure ideas,\nfor they are by no means ideas, but immediate affections of the will in\nits manifestation, the body; compulsory, instantaneous willing or\nnot-willing of the impression which the body sustains. There are only a\nfew impressions of the body which do not touch the will, and it is through\nthese alone that the body is an immediate object of knowledge, for, as\nperceived by the understanding, it is already an indirect object like all\nothers. These impressions are, therefore, to be treated directly as mere\nideas, and excepted from what has been said. The impressions we refer to\nare the affections of the purely objective senses of sight, hearing, and\ntouch, though only so far as these organs are affected in the way which is\nspecially peculiar to their specific nature. This affection of them is so\nexcessively weak an excitement of the heightened and specifically modified\nsensibility of these parts that it does not affect the will, but only\nfurnishes the understanding with the data out of which the perception\narises, undisturbed by any excitement of the will. But every stronger or\ndifferent kind of affection of these organs of sense is painful, that is\nto say, against the will, and thus they also belong to its objectivity.\nWeakness of the nerves shows itself in this, that the impressions which\nhave only such a degree of strength as would usually be sufficient to make\nthem data for the understanding reach the higher degree at which they\ninfluence the will, that is to say, give pain or pleasure, though more\noften pain, which is, however, to some extent deadened and inarticulate,\nso that not only particular tones and strong light are painful to us, but\nthere ensues a generally unhealthy and hypochondriacal disposition which\nis not distinctly understood. The identity of the body and the will shows\nitself further, among other ways, in the circumstance that every vehement\nand excessive movement of the will, _i.e._, every emotion, agitates the\nbody and its inner constitution directly, and disturbs the course of its\nvital functions. This is shown in detail in \u201cWill in Nature,\u201d p. 27 of the\nsecond edition and p. 28 of the third.\nLastly, the knowledge which I have of my will, though it is immediate,\ncannot be separated from that which I have of my body. I know my will, not\nas a whole, not as a unity, not completely, according to its nature, but I\nknow it only in its particular acts, and therefore in time, which is the\nform of the phenomenal aspect of my body, as of every object. Therefore\nthe body is a condition of the knowledge of my will. Thus, I cannot really\nimagine this will apart from my body. In the essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, the will, or rather the subject of willing, is treated\nas a special class of ideas or objects. But even there we saw this object\nbecome one with the subject; that is, we saw it cease to be an object. We\nthere called this union the miracle \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03c7\u03b7\u03bd, and the whole of the\npresent work is to a certain extent an explanation of this. So far as I\nknow my will specially as object, I know it as body. But then I am again\nat the first class of ideas laid down in that essay, _i.e._, real objects.\nAs we proceed we shall see always more clearly that these ideas of the\nfirst class obtain their explanation and solution from those of the fourth\nclass given in the essay, which could no longer be properly opposed to the\nsubject as object, and that, therefore, we must learn to understand the\ninner nature of the law of causality which is valid in the first class,\nand of all that happens in accordance with it from the law of motivation\nwhich governs the fourth class.\nThe identity of the will and the body, of which we have now given a\ncursory explanation, can only be proved in the manner we have adopted\nhere. We have proved this identity for the first time, and shall do so\nmore and more fully in the course of this work. By \u201cproved\u201d we mean raised\nfrom the immediate consciousness, from knowledge in the concrete to\nabstract knowledge of the reason, or carried over into abstract knowledge.\nOn the other hand, from its very nature it can never be demonstrated, that\nis, deduced as indirect knowledge from some other more direct knowledge,\njust because it is itself the most direct knowledge; and if we do not\napprehend it and stick to it as such, we shall expect in vain to receive\nit again in some indirect way as derivative knowledge. It is knowledge of\nquite a special kind, whose truth cannot therefore properly be brought\nunder any of the four rubrics under which I have classified all truth in\nthe essay on the principle of sufficient reason, \u00a7 29, the logical, the\nempirical, the metaphysical, and the metalogical, for it is not, like all\nthese, the relation of an abstract idea to another idea, or to the\nnecessary form of perceptive or of abstract ideation, but it is the\nrelation of a judgment to the connection which an idea of perception, the\nbody, has to that which is not an idea at all, but something _toto genere_\ndifferent, will. I should like therefore to distinguish this from all\nother truth, and call it \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03c7\u03b7\u03bd _philosophical truth_. We can turn\nthe expression of this truth in different ways and say: My body and my\nwill are one;\u2014or, What as an idea of perception I call my body, I call my\nwill, so far as I am conscious of it in an entirely different way which\ncannot be compared to any other;\u2014or, My body is the _objectivity_ of my\nwill;\u2014or, My body considered apart from the fact that it is my idea is\nstill my will, and so forth.(27)\n\u00a7 19. In the first book we were reluctantly driven to explain the human\nbody as merely idea of the subject which knows it, like all the other\nobjects of this world of perception. But it has now become clear that what\nenables us consciously to distinguish our own body from all other objects\nwhich in other respects are precisely the same, is that our body appears\nin consciousness in quite another way _toto genere_ different from idea,\nand this we denote by the word _will_; and that it is just this double\nknowledge which we have of our own body that affords us information about\nit, about its action and movement following on motives, and also about\nwhat it experiences by means of external impressions; in a word, about\nwhat it is, not as idea, but as more than idea; that is to say, what it is\n_in itself_. None of this information have we got directly with regard to\nthe nature, action, and experience of other real objects.\nIt is just because of this special relation to one body that the knowing\nsubject is an individual. For regarded apart from this relation, his body\nis for him only an idea like all other ideas. But the relation through\nwhich the knowing subject is an _individual_, is just on that account a\nrelation which subsists only between him and one particular idea of all\nthose which he has. Therefore he is conscious of this _one_ idea, not\nmerely as an idea, but in quite a different way as a will. If, however, he\nabstracts from that special relation, from that twofold and completely\nheterogeneous knowledge of what is one and the same, then that _one_, the\nbody, is an idea like all other ideas. Therefore, in order to understand\nthe matter, the individual who knows must either assume that what\ndistinguishes that one idea from others is merely the fact that his\nknowledge stands in this double relation to it alone; that insight in two\nways at the same time is open to him only in the case of this one object\nof perception, and that this is to be explained not by the difference of\nthis object from all others, but only by the difference between the\nrelation of his knowledge to this one object, and its relation to all\nother objects. Or else he must assume that this object is essentially\ndifferent from all others; that it alone of all objects is at once both\nwill and idea, while the rest are only ideas, _i.e._, only phantoms. Thus\nhe must assume that his body is the only real individual in the world,\n_i.e._, the only phenomenon of will and the only immediate object of the\nsubject. That other objects, considered merely as _ideas_, are like his\nbody, that is, like it, fill space (which itself can only be present as\nidea), and also, like it, are causally active in space, is indeed\ndemonstrably certain from the law of causality which is _a priori_ valid\nfor ideas, and which admits of no effect without a cause; but apart from\nthe fact that we can only reason from an effect to a cause generally, and\nnot to a similar cause, we are still in the sphere of mere ideas, in which\nalone the law of causality is valid, and beyond which it can never take\nus. But whether the objects known to the individual only as ideas are yet,\nlike his own body, manifestations of a will, is, as was said in the First\nBook, the proper meaning of the question as to the reality of the external\nworld. To deny this is _theoretical egoism_, which on that account regards\nall phenomena that are outside its own will as phantoms, just as in a\npractical reference exactly the same thing is done by practical egoism.\nFor in it a man regards and treats himself alone as a person, and all\nother persons as mere phantoms. Theoretical egoism can never be\ndemonstrably refuted, yet in philosophy it has never been used otherwise\nthan as a sceptical sophism, _i.e._, a pretence. As a serious conviction,\non the other hand, it could only be found in a madhouse, and as such it\nstands in need of a cure rather than a refutation. We do not therefore\ncombat it any further in this regard, but treat it as merely the last\nstronghold of scepticism, which is always polemical. Thus our knowledge,\nwhich is always bound to individuality and is limited by this\ncircumstance, brings with it the necessity that each of us can only _be\none_, while, on the other hand, each of us can _know all_; and it is this\nlimitation that creates the need for philosophy. We therefore who, for\nthis very reason, are striving to extend the limits of our knowledge\nthrough philosophy, will treat this sceptical argument of theoretical\negoism which meets us, as an army would treat a small frontier fortress.\nThe fortress cannot indeed be taken, but the garrison can never sally\nforth from it, and therefore we pass it by without danger, and are not\nafraid to have it in our rear.\nThe double knowledge which each of us has of the nature and activity of\nhis own body, and which is given in two completely different ways, has now\nbeen clearly brought out. We shall accordingly make further use of it as a\nkey to the nature of every phenomenon in nature, and shall judge of all\nobjects which are not our own bodies, and are consequently not given to\nour consciousness in a double way but only as ideas, according to the\nanalogy of our own bodies, and shall therefore assume that as in one\naspect they are idea, just like our bodies, and in this respect are\nanalogous to them, so in another aspect, what remains of objects when we\nset aside their existence as idea of the subject, must in its inner nature\nbe the same as that in us which we call _will_. For what other kind of\nexistence or reality should we attribute to the rest of the material\nworld? Whence should we take the elements out of which we construct such a\nworld? Besides will and idea nothing is known to us or thinkable. If we\nwish to attribute the greatest known reality to the material world which\nexists immediately only in our idea, we give it the reality which our own\nbody has for each of us; for that is the most real thing for every one.\nBut if we now analyse the reality of this body and its actions, beyond the\nfact that it is idea, we find nothing in it except the will; with this its\nreality is exhausted. Therefore we can nowhere find another kind of\nreality which we can attribute to the material world. Thus if we hold that\nthe material world is something more than merely our idea, we must say\nthat besides being idea, that is, in itself and according to its inmost\nnature, it is that which we find immediately in ourselves as _will_. I say\naccording to its inmost nature; but we must first come to know more\naccurately this real nature of the will, in order that we may be able to\ndistinguish from it what does not belong to itself, but to its\nmanifestation, which has many grades. Such, for example, is the\ncircumstance of its being accompanied by knowledge, and the determination\nby motives which is conditioned by this knowledge. As we shall see farther\non, this does not belong to the real nature of will, but merely to its\ndistinct manifestation as an animal or a human being. If, therefore, I\nsay,\u2014the force which attracts a stone to the earth is according to its\nnature, in itself, and apart from all idea, will, I shall not be supposed\nto express in this proposition the insane opinion that the stone moves\nitself in accordance with a known motive, merely because this is the way\nin which will appears in man.(28) We shall now proceed more clearly and in\ndetail to prove, establish, and develop to its full extent what as yet has\nonly been provisionally and generally explained.(29)\n\u00a7 20. As we have said, the will proclaims itself primarily in the\nvoluntary movements of our own body, as the inmost nature of this body, as\nthat which it is besides being object of perception, idea. For these\nvoluntary movements are nothing else than the visible aspect of the\nindividual acts of will, with which they are directly coincident and\nidentical, and only distinguished through the form of knowledge into which\nthey have passed, and in which alone they can be known, the form of idea.\nBut these acts of will have always a ground or reason outside themselves\nin motives. Yet these motives never determine more than what I will at\n_this_ time, in _this_ place, and under _these_ circumstances, not _that_\nI will in general, or _what_ I will in general, that is, the maxims which\ncharacterise my volition generally. Therefore the inner nature of my\nvolition cannot be explained from these motives; but they merely determine\nits manifestation at a given point of time: they are merely the occasion\nof my will showing itself; but the will itself lies outside the province\nof the law of motivation, which determines nothing but its appearance at\neach point of time. It is only under the presupposition of my empirical\ncharacter that the motive is a sufficient ground of explanation of my\naction. But if I abstract from my character, and then ask, why, in\ngeneral, I will this and not that, no answer is possible, because it is\nonly the manifestation of the will that is subject to the principle of\nsufficient reason, and not the will itself, which in this respect is to be\ncalled _groundless_. At this point I presuppose Kant\u2019s doctrine of the\nempirical and intelligible character, and also my own treatment of the\nsubject in \u201cThe Fundamental Problems of Ethics,\u201d pp. 48, 58, and 178, _et\nseq._, of first edition (p. 174, _et seq._, of second edition). I shall\nalso have to speak more fully on the question in the Fourth Book. For the\npresent, I have only to draw attention to this, that the fact of one\nmanifestation being established through another, as here the deed through\nthe motive, does not at all conflict with the fact that its real nature is\nwill, which itself has no _ground_; for as the principle of sufficient\nreason in all its aspects is only the form of knowledge, its validity\nextends only to the idea, to the phenomena, to the visibility of the will,\nbut not to the will itself, which becomes visible.\nIf now every action of my body is the manifestation of an act of will in\nwhich my will itself in general, and as a whole, thus my character,\nexpresses itself under given motives, manifestation of the will must be\nthe inevitable condition and presupposition of every action. For the fact\nof its manifestation cannot depend upon something which does not exist\ndirectly and only through it, which consequently is for it merely\naccidental, and through which its manifestation itself would be merely\naccidental. Now that condition is just the whole body itself. Thus the\nbody itself must be manifestation of the will, and it must be related to\nmy will as a whole, that is, to my intelligible character, whose\nphenomenal appearance in time is my empirical character, as the particular\naction of the body is related to the particular act of the will. The whole\nbody, then, must be simply my will become visible, must be my will itself,\nso far as this is object of perception, an idea of the first class. It has\nalready been advanced in confirmation of this that every impression upon\nmy body also affects my will at once and immediately, and in this respect\nis called pain or pleasure, or, in its lower degrees, agreeable or\ndisagreeable sensation; and also, conversely, that every violent movement\nof the will, every emotion or passion, convulses the body and disturbs the\ncourse of its functions. Indeed we can also give an etiological account,\nthough a very incomplete one, of the origin of my body, and a somewhat\nbetter account of its development and conservation, and this is the\nsubstance of physiology. But physiology merely explains its theme in\nprecisely the same way as motives explain action. Thus the physiological\nexplanation of the functions of the body detracts just as little from the\nphilosophical truth that the whole existence of this body and the sum\ntotal of its functions are merely the objectification of that will which\nappears in its outward actions in accordance with a motive, as the\nestablishment of the individual action through the motive and the\nnecessary sequence of the action from the motive conflicts with the fact\nthat action in general, and according to its nature, is only the\nmanifestation of a will which itself has no ground. If, however,\nphysiology tries to refer even these outward actions, the immediate\nvoluntary movements, to causes in the organism,\u2014for example, if it\nexplains the movement of the muscles as resulting from the presence of\nfluids (\u201clike the contraction of a cord when it is wet,\u201d says Reil in his\n\u201cArchiv f\u00fcr Physiologie,\u201d vol. vi. p. 153), even supposing it really could\ngive a thorough explanation of this kind, yet this would never invalidate\nthe immediately certain truth that every voluntary motion (_functiones\nanimales_) is the manifestation of an act of will. Now, just as little can\nthe physiological explanation of vegetative life (_functiones naturales\nvitales_), however far it may advance, ever invalidate the truth that the\nwhole animal life which thus develops itself is the manifestation of will.\nIn general, then, as we have shown above, no etiological explanation can\never give us more than the necessarily determined position in time and\nspace of a particular manifestation, its necessary appearance there,\naccording to a fixed law; but the inner nature of everything that appears\nin this way remains wholly inexplicable, and is presupposed by every\netiological explanation, and merely indicated by the names, force, or law\nof nature, or, if we are speaking of action, character or will. Thus,\nalthough every particular action, under the presupposition of the definite\ncharacter, necessarily follows from the given motive, and although growth,\nthe process of nourishment, and all the changes of the animal body take\nplace according to necessarily acting causes (stimuli), yet the whole\nseries of actions, and consequently every individual act, and also its\ncondition, the whole body itself which accomplishes it, and therefore also\nthe process through which and in which it exists, are nothing but the\nmanifestation of the will, the becoming visible, _the objectification of\nthe will_. Upon this rests the perfect suitableness of the human and\nanimal body to the human and animal will in general, resembling, though\nfar surpassing, the correspondence between an instrument made for a\npurpose and the will of the maker, and on this account appearing as\ndesign, _i.e._, the teleological explanation of the body. The parts of the\nbody must, therefore, completely correspond to the principal desires\nthrough which the will manifests itself; they must be the visible\nexpression of these desires. Teeth, throat, and bowels are objectified\nhunger; the organs of generation are objectified sexual desire; the\ngrasping hand, the hurrying feet, correspond to the more indirect desires\nof the will which they express. As the human form generally corresponds to\nthe human will generally, so the individual bodily structure corresponds\nto the individually modified will, the character of the individual, and\ntherefore it is throughout and in all its parts characteristic and full of\nexpression. It is very remarkable that Parmenides already gave expression\nto this in the following verses, quoted by Aristotle (Metaph. iii. 5):\u2014\n\u1f49\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\n\u03a4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd; \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\n\u0395\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f41\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03b5\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\n\u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9; \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1.\n(Ut enim cuique complexio membrorum flexibilium se habet, ita mens\nhominibus adest: idem namque est, quod sapit, membrorum natura hominibus,\net omnibus et omni: quod enim plus est, intelligentia est.)(30)\n\u00a7 21. Whoever has now gained from all these expositions a knowledge _in\nabstracto_, and therefore clear and certain, of what every one knows\ndirectly _in concreto_, _i.e._, as feeling, a knowledge that his will is\nthe real inner nature of his phenomenal being, which manifests itself to\nhim as idea, both in his actions and in their permanent substratum, his\nbody, and that his will is that which is most immediate in his\nconsciousness, though it has not as such completely passed into the form\nof idea in which object and subject stand over against each other, but\nmakes itself known to him in a direct manner, in which he does not quite\nclearly distinguish subject and object, yet is not known as a whole to the\nindividual himself, but only in its particular acts,\u2014whoever, I say, has\nwith me gained this conviction will find that of itself it affords him the\nkey to the knowledge of the inmost being of the whole of nature; for he\nnow transfers it to all those phenomena which are not given to him, like\nhis own phenomenal existence, both in direct and indirect knowledge, but\nonly in the latter, thus merely one-sidedly as _idea_ alone. He will\nrecognise this will of which we are speaking not only in those phenomenal\nexistences which exactly resemble his own, in men and animals as their\ninmost nature, but the course of reflection will lead him to recognise the\nforce which germinates and vegetates in the plant, and indeed the force\nthrough which the crystal is formed, that by which the magnet turns to the\nnorth pole, the force whose shock he experiences from the contact of two\ndifferent kinds of metals, the force which appears in the elective\naffinities of matter as repulsion and attraction, decomposition and\ncombination, and, lastly, even gravitation, which acts so powerfully\nthroughout matter, draws the stone to the earth and the earth to the\nsun,\u2014all these, I say, he will recognise as different only in their\nphenomenal existence, but in their inner nature as identical, as that\nwhich is directly known to him so intimately and so much better than\nanything else, and which in its most distinct manifestation is called\n_will_. It is this application of reflection alone that prevents us from\nremaining any longer at the phenomenon, and leads us to the _thing in\nitself_. Phenomenal existence is idea and nothing more. All idea, of\nwhatever kind it may be, all _object_, is _phenomenal_ existence, but the\n_will_ alone is a _thing in itself_. As such, it is throughout not idea,\nbut _toto genere_ different from it; it is that of which all idea, all\nobject, is the phenomenal appearance, the visibility, the objectification.\nIt is the inmost nature, the kernel, of every particular thing, and also\nof the whole. It appears in every blind force of nature and also in the\npreconsidered action of man; and the great difference between these two is\nmerely in the degree of the manifestation, not in the nature of what\nmanifests itself.\n\u00a7 22. Now, if we are to think as an object this thing-in-itself (we wish\nto retain the Kantian expression as a standing formula), which, as such,\nis never object, because all object is its mere manifestation, and\ntherefore cannot be it itself, we must borrow for it the name and concept\nof an object, of something in some way objectively given, consequently of\none of its own manifestations. But in order to serve as a clue for the\nunderstanding, this can be no other than the most complete of all its\nmanifestations, _i.e._, the most distinct, the most developed, and\ndirectly enlightened by knowledge. Now this is the human will. It is,\nhowever, well to observe that here, at any rate, we only make use of a\n_denominatio a potiori_, through which, therefore, the concept of will\nreceives a greater extension than it has hitherto had. Knowledge of the\nidentical in different phenomena, and of difference in similar phenomena,\nis, as Plato so often remarks, a _sine qua non_ of philosophy. But\nhitherto it was not recognised that every kind of active and operating\nforce in nature is essentially identical with will, and therefore the\nmultifarious kinds of phenomena were not seen to be merely different\nspecies of the same genus, but were treated as heterogeneous. Consequently\nthere could be no word to denote the concept of this genus. I therefore\nname the genus after its most important species, the direct knowledge of\nwhich lies nearer to us and guides us to the indirect knowledge of all\nother species. But whoever is incapable of carrying out the required\nextension of the concept will remain involved in a permanent\nmisunderstanding. For by the word _will_ he understands only that species\nof it which has hitherto been exclusively denoted by it, the will which is\nguided by knowledge, and whose manifestation follows only upon motives,\nand indeed merely abstract motives, and thus takes place under the\nguidance of the reason. This, we have said, is only the most prominent\nexample of the manifestation of will. We must now distinctly separate in\nthought the inmost essence of this manifestation which is known to us\ndirectly, and then transfer it to all the weaker, less distinct\nmanifestations of the same nature, and thus we shall accomplish the\ndesired extension of the concept of will. From another point of view I\nshould be equally misunderstood by any one who should think that it is all\nthe same in the end whether we denote this inner nature of all phenomena\nby the word _will_ or by any other. This would be the case if the\nthing-in-itself were something whose existence we merely _inferred_, and\nthus knew indirectly and only in the abstract. Then, indeed, we might call\nit what we pleased; the name would stand merely as the symbol of an\nunknown quantity. But the word _will_, which, like a magic spell,\ndiscloses to us the inmost being of everything in nature, is by no means\nan unknown quantity, something arrived at only by inference, but is fully\nand immediately comprehended, and is so familiar to us that we know and\nunderstand what will is far better than anything else whatever. The\nconcept of will has hitherto commonly been subordinated to that of force,\nbut I reverse the matter entirely, and desire that every force in nature\nshould be thought as will. It must not be supposed that this is mere\nverbal quibbling or of no consequence; rather, it is of the greatest\nsignificance and importance. For at the foundation of the concept of\nforce, as of all other concepts, there ultimately lies the knowledge in\nsense-perception of the objective world, that is to say, the phenomenon,\nthe idea; and the concept is constructed out of this. It is an abstraction\nfrom the province in which cause and effect reign, _i.e._, from ideas of\nperception, and means just the causal nature of causes at the point at\nwhich this causal nature is no further etiologically explicable, but is\nthe necessary presupposition of all etiological explanation. The concept\nwill, on the other hand, is of all possible concepts the only one which\nhas its source _not_ in the phenomenal, _not_ in the mere idea of\nperception, but comes from within, and proceeds from the most immediate\nconsciousness of each of us, in which each of us knows his own\nindividuality, according to its nature, immediately, apart from all form,\neven that of subject and object, and which at the same time is this\nindividuality, for here the subject and the object of knowledge are one.\nIf, therefore, we refer the concept of _force_ to that of _will_, we have\nin fact referred the less known to what is infinitely better known;\nindeed, to the one thing that is really immediately and fully known to us,\nand have very greatly extended our knowledge. If, on the contrary, we\nsubsume the concept of will under that of force, as has hitherto always\nbeen done, we renounce the only immediate knowledge which we have of the\ninner nature of the world, for we allow it to disappear in a concept which\nis abstracted from the phenomenal, and with which we can therefore never\ngo beyond the phenomenal.\n\u00a7 23. The _will_ as a thing in itself is quite different from its\nphenomenal appearance, and entirely free from all the forms of the\nphenomenal, into which it first passes when it manifests itself, and which\ntherefore only concern its _objectivity_, and are foreign to the will\nitself. Even the most universal form of all idea, that of being object for\na subject, does not concern it; still less the forms which are subordinate\nto this and which collectively have their common expression in the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, to which we know that time and space\nbelong, and consequently multiplicity also, which exists and is possible\nonly through these. In this last regard I shall call time and space the\n_principium individuationis_, borrowing an expression from the old\nschoolmen, and I beg to draw attention to this, once for all. For it is\nonly through the medium of time and space that what is one and the same,\nboth according to its nature and to its concept, yet appears as different,\nas a multiplicity of co-existent and successive phenomena. Thus time and\nspace are the _principium individuationis_, the subject of so many\nsubtleties and disputes among the schoolmen, which may be found collected\nin Suarez (Disp. 5, Sect. 3). According to what has been said, the will as\na thing-in-itself lies outside the province of the principle of sufficient\nreason in all its forms, and is consequently completely groundless,\nalthough all its manifestations are entirely subordinated to the principle\nof sufficient reason. Further, it is free from all _multiplicity_,\nalthough its manifestations in time and space are innumerable. It is\nitself one, though not in the sense in which an object is one, for the\nunity of an object can only be known in opposition to a possible\nmultiplicity; nor yet in the sense in which a concept is one, for the\nunity of a concept originates only in abstraction from a multiplicity; but\nit is one as that which lies outside time and space, the _principium\nindividuationis_, _i.e._, the possibility of multiplicity. Only when all\nthis has become quite clear to us through the subsequent examination of\nthe phenomena and different manifestations of the will, shall we fully\nunderstand the meaning of the Kantian doctrine that time, space and\ncausality do not belong to the thing-in-itself, but are only forms of\nknowing.\nThe uncaused nature of will has been actually recognised, where it\nmanifests itself most distinctly, as the will of man, and this has been\ncalled free, independent. But on account of the uncaused nature of the\nwill itself, the necessity to which its manifestation is everywhere\nsubjected has been overlooked, and actions are treated as free, which they\nare not. For every individual action follows with strict necessity from\nthe effect of the motive upon the character. All necessity is, as we have\nalready said, the relation of the consequent to the reason, and nothing\nmore. The principle of sufficient reason is the universal form of all\nphenomena, and man in his action must be subordinated to it like every\nother phenomenon. But because in self-consciousness the will is known\ndirectly and in itself, in this consciousness lies also the consciousness\nof freedom. The fact is, however, overlooked that the individual, the\nperson, is not will as a thing-in-itself, but is a _phenomenon_ of will,\nis already determined as such, and has come under the form of the\nphenomenal, the principle of sufficient reason. Hence arises the strange\nfact that every one believes himself _a priori_ to be perfectly free, even\nin his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence\nanother manner of life, which just means that he can become another\nperson. But _a posteriori_, through experience, he finds to his\nastonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity; that in\nspite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his\nconduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must\ncarry out the very character which he himself condemns, and as it were\nplay the part he has undertaken to the end. I cannot pursue this subject\nfurther at present, for it belongs, as ethical, to another part of this\nwork. In the meantime, I only wish to point out here that the _phenomenon_\nof the will which in itself is uncaused, is yet as such subordinated to\nthe law of necessity, that is, the principle of sufficient reason, so that\nin the necessity with which the phenomena of nature follow each other, we\nmay find nothing to hinder us from recognising in them the manifestations\nof will.\nOnly those changes which have no other ground than a motive, _i.e._, an\nidea, have hitherto been regarded as manifestations of will. Therefore in\nnature a will has only been attributed to man, or at the most to animals;\nfor knowledge, the idea, is of course, as I have said elsewhere, the true\nand exclusive characteristic of animal life. But that the will is also\nactive where no knowledge guides it, we see at once in the instinct and\nthe mechanical skill of animals.(31) That they have ideas and knowledge is\nhere not to the point, for the end towards which they strive as definitely\nas if it were a known motive, is yet entirely unknown to them. Therefore\nin such cases their action takes place without motive, is not guided by\nthe idea, and shows us first and most distinctly how the will may be\nactive entirely without knowledge. The bird of a year old has no idea of\nthe eggs for which it builds a nest; the young spider has no idea of the\nprey for which it spins a web; nor has the ant-lion any idea of the ants\nfor which he digs a trench for the first time. The larva of the\nstag-beetle makes the hole in the wood, in which it is to await its\nmetamorphosis, twice as big if it is going to be a male beetle as if it is\ngoing to be a female, so that if it is a male there may be room for the\nhorns, of which, however, it has no idea. In such actions of these\ncreatures the will is clearly operative as in their other actions, but it\nis in blind activity, which is indeed accompanied by knowledge but not\nguided by it. If now we have once gained insight into the fact, that idea\nas motive is not a necessary and essential condition of the activity of\nthe will, we shall more easily recognise the activity of will where it is\nless apparent. For example, we shall see that the house of the snail is no\nmore made by a will which is foreign to the snail itself, than the house\nwhich we build is produced through another will than our own; but we shall\nrecognise in both houses the work of a will which objectifies itself in\nboth the phenomena\u2014a will which works in us according to motives, but in\nthe snail still blindly as formative impulse directed outwards. In us also\nthe same will is in many ways only blindly active: in all the functions of\nour body which are not guided by knowledge, in all its vital and\nvegetative processes, digestion, circulation, secretion, growth,\nreproduction. Not only the actions of the body, but the whole body itself\nis, as we have shown above, phenomenon of the will, objectified will,\nconcrete will. All that goes on in it must therefore proceed through will,\nalthough here this will is not guided by knowledge, but acts blindly\naccording to causes, which in this case are called _stimuli_.\nI call a _cause_, in the narrowest sense of the word, that state of\nmatter, which, while it introduces another state with necessity, yet\nsuffers just as great a change itself as that which it causes; which is\nexpressed in the rule, \u201caction and reaction are equal.\u201d Further, in the\ncase of what is properly speaking a cause, the effect increases directly\nin proportion to the cause, and therefore also the reaction. So that, if\nonce the mode of operation be known, the degree of the effect may be\nmeasured and calculated from the degree of the intensity of the cause; and\nconversely the degree of the intensity of the cause may be calculated from\nthe degree of the effect. Such causes, properly so called, operate in all\nthe phenomena of mechanics, chemistry, and so forth; in short, in all the\nchanges of unorganised bodies. On the other hand, I call a _stimulus_,\nsuch a cause as sustains no reaction proportional to its effect, and the\nintensity of which does not vary directly in proportion to the intensity\nof its effect, so that the effect cannot be measured by it. On the\ncontrary, a small increase of the stimulus may cause a very great increase\nof the effect, or conversely, it may eliminate the previous effect\naltogether, and so forth. All effects upon organised bodies as such are of\nthis kind. All properly organic and vegetative changes of the animal body\nmust therefore be referred to stimuli, not to mere causes. But the\nstimulus, like every cause and motive generally, never determines more\nthan the point of time and space at which the manifestation of every force\nis to take place, and does not determine the inner nature of the force\nitself which is manifested. This inner nature we know, from our previous\ninvestigation, is will, to which therefore we ascribe both the unconscious\nand the conscious changes of the body. The stimulus holds the mean, forms\nthe transition between the motive, which is causality accompanied\nthroughout by knowledge, and the cause in the narrowest sense. In\nparticular cases it is sometimes nearer a motive, sometimes nearer a\ncause, but yet it can always be distinguished from both. Thus, for\nexample, the rising of the sap in a plant follows upon stimuli, and cannot\nbe explained from mere causes, according to the laws of hydraulics or\ncapillary attraction; yet it is certainly assisted by these, and\naltogether approaches very near to a purely causal change. On the other\nhand, the movements of the _Hedysarum gyrans_ and the _Mimosa pudica_,\nalthough still following upon mere stimuli, are yet very like movements\nwhich follow upon motives, and seem almost to wish to make the transition.\nThe contraction of the pupils of the eyes as the light is increased is due\nto stimuli, but it passes into movement which is due to motive; for it\ntakes place, because too strong lights would affect the retina painfully,\nand to avoid this we contract the pupils. The occasion of an erection is a\nmotive, because it is an idea, yet it operates with the necessity of a\nstimulus, _i.e._, it cannot be resisted, but we must put the idea away in\norder to make it cease to affect us. This is also the case with disgusting\nthings, which excite the desire to vomit. Thus we have treated the\ninstinct of animals as an actual link, of quite a distinct kind, between\nmovement following upon stimuli, and action following upon a known motive.\nNow we might be asked to regard breathing as another link of this kind. It\nhas been disputed whether it belongs to the voluntary or the involuntary\nmovements, that is to say, whether it follows upon motive or stimulus, and\nperhaps it may be explained as something which is between the two.\nMarshall Hall (\u201cOn the Diseases of the Nervous System,\u201d \u00a7 293 sq.)\nexplains it as a mixed function, for it is partly under the influence of\nthe cerebral (voluntary), and partly under that of the spinal\n(non-voluntary) nerves. However, we are finally obliged to number it with\nthe expressions of will which result from motives. For other motives,\n_i.e._, mere ideas, can determine the will to check it or accelerate it,\nand, as is the case with every other voluntary action, it seems to us that\nwe could give up breathing altogether and voluntarily suffocate. And in\nfact we could do so if any other motive influenced the will sufficiently\nstrongly to overcome the pressing desire for air. According to some\naccounts Diogenes actually put an end to his life in this way (Diog.\nLaert. VI. 76). Certain negroes also are said to have done this (F. B.\nOsiander \u201cOn Suicide\u201d [1813] pp. 170-180). If this be true, it affords us\na good example of the influence of abstract motives, _i.e._, of the\nvictory of distinctively rational over merely animal will. For, that\nbreathing is at least partially conditioned by cerebral activity is shown\nby the fact that the primary cause of death from prussic acid is that it\nparalyses the brain, and so, indirectly, restricts the breathing; but if\nthe breathing be artificially maintained till the stupefaction of the\nbrain has passed away, death will not ensue. We may also observe in\npassing that breathing affords us the most obvious example of the fact\nthat motives act with just as much necessity as stimuli, or as causes in\nthe narrowest sense of the word, and their operation can only be\nneutralised by antagonistic motives, as action is neutralised by\nre-action. For, in the case of breathing, the illusion that we can stop\nwhen we like is much weaker than in the case of other movements which\nfollow upon motives; because in breathing the motive is very powerful,\nvery near to us, and its satisfaction is very easy, for the muscles which\naccomplish it are never tired, nothing, as a rule, obstructs it, and the\nwhole process is supported by the most inveterate habit of the individual.\nAnd yet all motives act with the same necessity. The knowledge that\nnecessity is common to movements following upon motives, and those\nfollowing upon stimuli, makes it easier for us to understand that that\nalso which takes place in our bodily organism in accordance with stimuli\nand in obedience to law, is yet, according to its inner nature\u2014will, which\nin all its manifestations, though never in itself, is subordinated to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, that is, to necessity.(32) Accordingly, we\nshall not rest contented with recognising that animals, both in their\nactions and also in their whole existence, bodily structure and\norganisation, are manifestations of will; but we shall extend to plants\nalso this immediate knowledge of the essential nature of things which is\ngiven to us alone. Now all the movements of plants follow upon stimuli;\nfor the absence of knowledge, and the movement following upon motives\nwhich is conditioned by knowledge, constitutes the only essential\ndifference between animals and plants. Therefore, what appears for the\nidea as plant life, as mere vegetation, as blindly impelling force, we\nshall claim, according to its inner nature, for will, and recognise it as\njust that which constitutes the basis of our own phenomenal being, as it\nexpresses itself in our actions, and also in the whole existence of our\nbody itself.\nIt only remains for us to take the final step, the extension of our way of\nlooking at things to all those forces which act in nature in accordance\nwith universal, unchangeable laws, in conformity with which the movements\nof all those bodies take place, which are wholly without organs, and have\ntherefore no susceptibility for stimuli, and have no knowledge, which is\nthe necessary condition of motives. Thus we must also apply the key to the\nunderstanding of the inner nature of things, which the immediate knowledge\nof our own existence alone can give us, to those phenomena of the\nunorganised world which are most remote from us. And if we consider them\nattentively, if we observe the strong and unceasing impulse with which the\nwaters hurry to the ocean, the persistency with which the magnet turns\never to the north pole, the readiness with which iron flies to the magnet,\nthe eagerness with which the electric poles seek to be re-united, and\nwhich, just like human desire, is increased by obstacles; if we see the\ncrystal quickly and suddenly take form with such wonderful regularity of\nconstruction, which is clearly only a perfectly definite and accurately\ndetermined impulse in different directions, seized and retained by\ncrystallisation; if we observe the choice with which bodies repel and\nattract each other, combine and separate, when they are set free in a\nfluid state, and emancipated from the bonds of rigidness; lastly, if we\nfeel directly how a burden which hampers our body by its gravitation\ntowards the earth, unceasingly presses and strains upon it in pursuit of\nits one tendency; if we observe all this, I say, it will require no great\neffort of the imagination to recognise, even at so great a distance, our\nown nature. That which in us pursues its ends by the light of knowledge;\nbut here, in the weakest of its manifestations, only strives blindly and\ndumbly in a one-sided and unchangeable manner, must yet in both cases come\nunder the name of will, as it is everywhere one and the same\u2014just as the\nfirst dim light of dawn must share the name of sunlight with the rays of\nthe full mid-day. For the name _will_ denotes that which is the inner\nnature of everything in the world, and the one kernel of every phenomenon.\nYet the remoteness, and indeed the appearance of absolute difference\nbetween the phenomena of unorganised nature and the will which we know as\nthe inner reality of our own being, arises chiefly from the contrast\nbetween the completely determined conformity to law of the one species of\nphenomena, and the apparently unfettered freedom of the other. For in man,\nindividuality makes itself powerfully felt. Every one has a character of\nhis own; and therefore the same motive has not the same influence over\nall, and a thousand circumstances which exist in the wide sphere of the\nknowledge of the individual, but are unknown to others, modify its effect.\nTherefore action cannot be predetermined from the motive alone, for the\nother factor is wanting, the accurate acquaintance with the individual\ncharacter, and with the knowledge which accompanies it. On the other hand,\nthe phenomena of the forces of nature illustrate the opposite extreme.\nThey act according to universal laws, without variation, without\nindividuality in accordance with openly manifest circumstances, subject to\nthe most exact predetermination; and the same force of nature appears in\nits million phenomena in precisely the same way. In order to explain this\npoint and prove the identity of the _one_ indivisible will in all its\ndifferent phenomena, in the weakest as in the strongest, we must first of\nall consider the relation of the will as thing-in-itself to its phenomena,\nthat is, the relation of the world as will to the world as idea; for this\nwill open to us the best way to a more thorough investigation of the whole\nsubject we are considering in this second book.(33)\n\u00a7 24. We have learnt from the great Kant that time, space, and causality,\nwith their entire constitution, and the possibility of all their forms,\nare present in our consciousness quite independently of the objects which\nappear in them, and which constitute their content; or, in other words,\nthey can be arrived at just as well if we start from the subject as if we\nstart from the object. Therefore, with equal accuracy, we may call them\neither forms of intuition or perception of the subject, or qualities of\nthe object _as object_ (with Kant, phenomenon), _i.e._, _idea_. We may\nalso regard these forms as the irreducible boundary between object and\nsubject. All objects must therefore exist in them, yet the subject,\nindependently of the phenomenal object, possesses and surveys them\ncompletely. But if the objects appearing in these forms are not to be\nempty phantoms, but are to have a meaning, they must refer to something,\nmust be the expression of something which is not, like themselves, object,\nidea, a merely relative existence for a subject, but which exists without\nsuch dependence upon something which stands over against it as a condition\nof its being, and independent of the forms of such a thing, _i.e._, _is\nnot idea_, but a _thing-in-itself_. Consequently it may at least be asked:\nAre these ideas, these objects, something more than or apart from the fact\nthat they are ideas, objects of the subject? And what would they be in\nthis sense? What is that other side of them which is _toto genere_\ndifferent from idea? What is the thing-in-itself? _The will_, we have\nanswered, but for the present I set that answer aside.\nWhatever the thing-in-itself may be, Kant is right in his conclusion that\ntime, space, and causality (which we afterwards found to be forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, the general expression of the forms of the\nphenomenon) are not its properties, but come to it only after, and so far\nas, it has become idea. That is, they belong only to its phenomenal\nexistence, not to itself. For since the subject fully understands and\nconstructs them out of itself, independently of all object, they must be\ndependent upon _existence as idea_ as such, not upon that which becomes\nidea. They must be the form of the idea as such; but not qualities of that\nwhich has assumed this form. They must be already given with the mere\nantithesis of subject and object (not as concepts but as facts), and\nconsequently they must be only the more exact determination of the form of\nknowledge in general, whose most universal determination is that\nantithesis itself. Now, that in the phenomenon, in the object, which is in\nits turn conditioned by time, space and causality, inasmuch as it can only\nbecome idea by means of them, namely _multiplicity_, through co-existence\nand succession, _change_ and _permanence_ through the law of causality,\n_matter_ which can only become idea under the presupposition of causality,\nand lastly, all that becomes idea only by means of these,\u2014all this, I say,\nas a whole, does not in reality belong to that which appears, to that\nwhich has passed into the form of idea, but belongs merely to this form\nitself. And conversely, that in the phenomenon which is not conditioned\nthrough time, space and causality, and which cannot be referred to them,\nnor explained in accordance with them, is precisely that in which the\nthing manifested, the thing-in-itself, directly reveals itself. It follows\nfrom this that the most complete capacity for being known, that is to say,\nthe greatest clearness, distinctness, and susceptibility of exhaustive\nexplanation, will necessarily belong to that which pertains to knowledge\n_as such_, and thus to the _form_ of knowledge; but not to that which in\nitself is not idea, not object, but which has become knowledge only\nthrough entering these forms; in other words, has become idea, object.\nThus only that which depends entirely upon being an object of knowledge,\nupon existing as idea in general and _as such_ (not upon that which\n_becomes_ known, and has only _become_ idea), which therefore belongs\nwithout distinction to everything that is known, and which, on that\naccount, is found just as well if we start from the subject as if we start\nfrom the object,\u2014this alone can afford us without reserve a sufficient,\nexhaustive knowledge, a knowledge which is clear to the very foundation.\nBut this consists of nothing but those forms of all phenomena of which we\nare conscious _a priori_, and which may be generally expressed as the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Now, the forms of this principle which\noccur in knowledge of perception (with which alone we are here concerned)\nare time, space, and causality. The whole of pure mathematics and pure\nnatural science _a priori_ is based entirely upon these. Therefore it is\nonly in these sciences that knowledge finds no obscurity, does not rest\nupon what is incomprehensible (groundless, _i.e._, will), upon what cannot\nbe further deduced. It is on this account that Kant wanted, as we have\nsaid, to apply the name science specially and even exclusively to these\nbranches of knowledge together with logic. But, on the other hand, these\nbranches of knowledge show us nothing more than mere connections,\nrelations of one idea to another, form devoid of all content. All content\nwhich they receive, every phenomenon which fills these forms, contains\nsomething which is no longer completely knowable in its whole nature,\nsomething which can no longer be entirely explained through something\nelse, something then which is groundless, through which consequently the\nknowledge loses its evidence and ceases to be completely lucid. This that\nwithholds itself from investigation, however, is the thing-in-itself, is\nthat which is essentially not idea, not object of knowledge, but has only\nbecome knowable by entering that form. The form is originally foreign to\nit, and the thing-in-itself can never become entirely one with it, can\nnever be referred to mere form, and, since this form is the principle of\nsufficient reason, can never be completely explained. If therefore all\nmathematics affords us an exhaustive knowledge of that which in the\nphenomena is quantity, position, number, in a word, spatial and temporal\nrelations; if all etiology gives us a complete account of the regular\nconditions under which phenomena, with all their determinations, appear in\ntime and space, but, with it all, teaches us nothing more than why in each\ncase this particular phenomenon must appear just at this time here, and at\nthis place now; it is clear that with their assistance we can never\npenetrate to the inner nature of things. There always remains something\nwhich no explanation can venture to attack, but which it always\npresupposes; the forces of nature, the definite mode of operation of\nthings, the quality and character of every phenomenon, that which is\nwithout ground, that which does not depend upon the form of the\nphenomenal, the principle of sufficient reason, but is something to which\nthis form in itself is foreign, something which has yet entered this form,\nand now appears according to its law, a law, however, which only\ndetermines the appearance, not that which appears, only the how, not the\nwhat, only the form, not the content. Mechanics, physics, and chemistry\nteach the rules and laws according to which the forces of impenetrability,\ngravitation, rigidity, fluidity, cohesion, elasticity, heat, light,\naffinity, magnetism, electricity, &c., operate; that is to say, the law,\nthe rule which these forces observe whenever they enter time and space.\nBut do what we will, the forces themselves remain _qualitates occult\u00e6_.\nFor it is just the thing-in-itself, which, because it is manifested,\nexhibits these phenomena, which are entirely different from itself. In its\nmanifestation, indeed, it is completely subordinated to the principle of\nsufficient reason as the form of the idea, but it can never itself be\nreferred to this form, and therefore cannot be fully explained\netiologically, can never be completely fathomed. It is certainly perfectly\ncomprehensible so far as it has assumed that form, that is, so far as it\nis phenomenon, but its inner nature is not in the least explained by the\nfact that it can thus be comprehended. Therefore the more necessity any\nknowledge carries with it, the more there is in it of that which cannot be\notherwise thought or presented in perception\u2014as, for example,\nspace-relations\u2014the clearer and more sufficing then it is, the less pure\nobjective content it has, or the less reality, properly so called, is\ngiven in it. And conversely, the more there is in it which must be\nconceived as mere chance, and the more it impresses us as given merely\nempirically, the more proper objectivity and true reality is there in such\nknowledge, and at the same time, the more that is inexplicable, that is,\nthat cannot be deduced from anything else.\nIt is true that at all times an etiology, unmindful of its real aim, has\nstriven to reduce all organised life to chemism or electricity; all\nchemism, that is to say quality, again to mechanism (action determined by\nthe shape of the atom), this again sometimes to the object of phoronomy,\n_i.e._, the combination of time and space, which makes motion possible,\nsometimes to the object of mere geometry, _i.e._, position in space (much\nin the same way as we rightly deduce the diminution of an effect from the\nsquare of the distance, and the theory of the lever in a purely\ngeometrical manner): geometry may finally be reduced to arithmetic, which,\non account of its one dimension, is of all the forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason, the most intelligible, comprehensible, and completely\nsusceptible of investigation. As instances of the method generally\nindicated here, we may refer to the atoms of Democritus, the vortex of\nDescartes, the mechanical physics of Lesage, which towards the end of last\ncentury tried to explain both chemical affinities and gravitation\nmechanically by impact and pressure, as may be seen in detail in \u201c_Lucr\u00e8ce\nNeutonien_;\u201d Reil\u2019s form and combination as the cause of animal life, also\ntends in this direction. Finally, the crude materialism which even now in\nthe middle of the nineteenth century has been served up again under the\nignorant delusion that it is original, belongs distinctly to this class.\nIt stupidly denies vital force, and first of all tries to explain the\nphenomena of life from physical and chemical forces, and those again from\nthe mechanical effects of the matter, position, form, and motion of\nimagined atoms, and thus seeks to reduce all the forces of nature to\naction and reaction as its thing-in-itself. According to this teaching,\nlight is the mechanical vibration or undulation of an imaginary ether,\npostulated for this end. This ether, if it reaches the eye, beats rapidly\nupon the retina, and gives us the knowledge of colour. Thus, for example,\nfour hundred and eighty-three billion beats in a second give red, and\nseven hundred and twenty-seven billion beats in a second give violet. Upon\nthis theory, persons who are colour-blind must be those who are unable to\ncount the beats, must they not? Such crass, mechanical, clumsy, and\ncertainly knotty theories, which remind one of Democritus, are quite\nworthy of those who, fifty years after the appearance of Goethe\u2019s doctrine\nof colour, still believe in Newton\u2019s homogeneous light, and are not\nashamed to say so. They will find that what is overlooked in the child\n(Democritus) will not be forgiven to the man. They might indeed, some day,\ncome to an ignominious end; but then every one would slink away and\npretend that he never had anything to do with them. We shall soon have to\nspeak again of this false reduction of the forces of nature to each other;\nso much for the present. Supposing this theory were possible, all would\ncertainly be explained and established and finally reduced to an\narithmetical problem, which would then be the holiest thing in the temple\nof wisdom, to which the principle of sufficient reason would at last have\nhappily conducted us. But all content of the phenomenon would have\ndisappeared, and the mere form would remain. The \u201cwhat appears\u201d would be\nreferred to the \u201chow it appears,\u201d and this \u201chow\u201d would be what is _a\npriori_ knowable, therefore entirely dependent on the subject, therefore\nonly for the subject, therefore, lastly, mere phantom, idea and form of\nidea, through and through: no thing-in-itself could be demanded.\nSupposing, then, that this were possible, the whole world would be derived\nfrom the subject, and in fact, that would be accomplished which Fichte\nwanted to _seem_ to accomplish by his empty bombast. But it is not\npossible: phantasies, sophisms, castles in the air, have been constructed\nin this way, but science never. The many and multifarious phenomena in\nnature have been successfully referred to particular original forces, and\nas often as this has been done, a real advance has been made. Several\nforces and qualities, which were at first regarded as different, have been\nderived from each other, and thus their number has been curtailed. (For\nexample, magnetism from electricity.) Etiology will have reached its goal\nwhen it has recognised and exhibited as such all the original forces of\nnature, and established their mode of operation, _i.e._, the law according\nto which, under the guidance of causality, their phenomena appear in time\nand space, and determine their position with regard to each other. But\ncertain original forces will always remain over; there will always remain\nas an insoluble residuum a content of phenomena which cannot be referred\nto their form, and thus cannot be explained from something else in\naccordance with the principle of sufficient reason. For in everything in\nnature there is something of which no ground can ever be assigned, of\nwhich no explanation is possible, and no ulterior cause is to be sought.\nThis is the specific nature of its action, _i.e._, the nature of its\nexistence, its being. Of each particular effect of the thing a cause may\nbe certainly indicated, from which it follows that it must act just at\nthis time and in this place; but no cause can ever be found from which it\nfollows that a thing acts in general, and precisely in the way it does. If\nit has no other qualities, if it is merely a mote in a sunbeam, it yet\nexhibits this unfathomable something, at least as weight and\nimpenetrability. But this, I say, is to the mote what his will is to a\nman; and, like the human will, it is, according to its inner nature, not\nsubject to explanation; nay, more\u2014it is in itself identical with this\nwill. It is true that a motive may be given for every manifestation of\nwill, for every act of will at a particular time and in a particular\nplace, upon which it must necessarily follow, under the presupposition of\nthe character of the man. But no reason can ever be given that the man has\nthis character; that he wills at all; that, of several motives, just this\none and no other, or indeed that any motive at all, moves his will. That\nwhich in the case of man is the unfathomable character which is\npresupposed in every explanation of his actions from motives is, in the\ncase of every unorganised body, its definitive quality\u2014the mode of its\naction, the manifestations of which are occasioned by impressions from\nwithout, while it itself, on the contrary, is determined by nothing\noutside itself, and thus is also inexplicable. Its particular\nmanifestations, through which alone it becomes visible, are subordinated\nto the principle of sufficient reason; it itself is groundless. This was\nin substance rightly understood by the schoolmen, who called it _forma\nsubstantialis_. (Cf. Suarez, Disput. Metaph., disp. xv. sect. 1.)\nIt is a greater and a commoner error that the phenomena which we best\nunderstand are those which are of most frequent occurrence, and which are\nmost universal and simple; for, on the contrary, these are just the\nphenomena that we are most accustomed to see about us, and to be ignorant\nof. It is just as inexplicable to us that a stone should fall to the earth\nas that an animal should move itself. It has been supposed, as we have\nremarked above, that, starting from the most universal forces of nature\n(gravitation, cohesion, impenetrability), it was possible to explain from\nthem the rarer forces, which only operate under a combination of\ncircumstances (for example, chemical quality, electricity, magnetism),\nand, lastly, from these to understand the organism and the life of\nanimals, and even the nature of human knowing and willing. Men resigned\nthemselves without a word to starting from mere _qualitates occult\u00e6_, the\nelucidation of which was entirely given up, for they intended to build\nupon them, not to investigate them. Such an intention cannot, as we have\nalready said, be carried out. But apart from this, such structures would\nalways stand in the air. What is the use of explanations which ultimately\nrefer us to something which is quite as unknown as the problem with which\nwe started? Do we in the end understand more of the inner nature of these\nuniversal natural forces than of the inner nature of an animal? Is not the\none as much a sealed book to us as the other? Unfathomable because it is\nwithout ground, because it is the content, that which the phenomenon is,\nand which can never be referred to the form, to the how, to the principle\nof sufficient reason. But we, who have in view not etiology but\nphilosophy, that is, not relative but unconditioned knowledge of the real\nnature of the world, take the opposite course, and start from that which\nis immediately and most completely known to us, and fully and entirely\ntrusted by us\u2014that which lies nearest to us, in order to understand that\nwhich is known to us only at a distance, one-sidedly and indirectly. From\nthe most powerful, most significant, and most distinct phenomenon we seek\nto arrive at an understanding of those that are less complete and weaker.\nWith the exception of my own body, all things are known to me only on\n_one_ side, that of the idea. Their inner nature remains hidden from me\nand a profound secret, even if I know all the causes from which their\nchanges follow. Only by comparison with that which goes on in me if my\nbody performs an action when I am influenced by a motive\u2014only by\ncomparison, I say, with what is the inner nature of my own changes\ndetermined by external reasons, can I obtain insight into the way in which\nthese lifeless bodies change under the influence of causes, and so\nunderstand what is their inner nature. For the knowledge of the causes of\nthe manifestation of this inner nature affords me merely the rule of its\nappearance in time and space, and nothing more. I can make this comparison\nbecause my body is the only object of which I know not merely the _one_\nside, that of the idea, but also the other side which is called will.\nThus, instead of believing that I would better understand my own\norganisation, and then my own knowing and willing, and my movements\nfollowing upon motives, if I could only refer them to movements due to\nelectrical, chemical, and mechanical causes, I must, seeing that I seek\nphilosophy and not etiology, learn to understand from my own movements\nfollowing upon motives the inner nature of the simplest and commonest\nmovements of an unorganised body which I see following upon causes. I must\nrecognise the inscrutable forces which manifest themselves in all natural\nbodies as identical in kind with that which in me is the will, and as\ndiffering from it only in degree. That is to say, the fourth class of\nideas given in the Essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason must be the\nkey to the knowledge of the inner nature of the first class, and by means\nof the law of motivation I must come to understand the inner meaning of\nthe law of causation.\nSpinoza (Epist. 62) says that if a stone which has been projected through\nthe air had consciousness, it would believe that it was moving of its own\nwill. I add to this only that the stone would be right. The impulse given\nit is for the stone what the motive is for me, and what in the case of the\nstone appears as cohesion, gravitation, rigidity, is in its inner nature\nthe same as that which I recognise in myself as will, and what the stone\nalso, if knowledge were given to it, would recognise as will. In the\npassage referred to, Spinoza had in view the necessity with which the\nstone flies, and he rightly desires to transfer this necessity to that of\nthe particular act of will of a person. I, on the other hand, consider the\ninner being, which alone imparts meaning and validity to all real\nnecessity (_i.e._, effect following upon a cause) as its presupposition.\nIn the case of men this is called character; in the case of a stone it is\ncalled quality, but it is the same in both. When it is immediately known\nit is called will. In the stone it has the weakest, and in man the\nstrongest degree of visibility, of objectivity. St. Augustine recognises,\nwith a true instinct, this identity of the tendencies of all things with\nour own willing, and I cannot refrain from quoting his na\u00efve account of\nthe matter:\u2014\u201c_Si pecora essemus, carnalem vitam et quod secundum sensum\nejusdem est amaremus, idque esset sufficiens bonum nostrum, et secundum\nhoc si esset nobis bene, nihil aliud qu\u00e6reremus. Item, si arbores essemus,\nnihil quidem sentientes motu amare possemus: verumtamen id quasi appetere\nvideremur, quo feracius essemus, uberiusque fructuos\u00e6. Si essemus lapides,\naut fluctus, aut ventus, aut flamma, vel quid ejusmodi, sine ullo quidem\nsensu atque vita, non tamen nobis deesset quasi quidam nostrorum locorum\natque ordinis appetitus. Nam velut amores corporum momenta sunt ponderum,\nsive deorsum gravitate, sive sursum levitate nitantur: ita enim corpus\npondere, sicut animus amore fertur quocunque fertur_\u201d (De Civ. Dei, xi.\n28).\nIt ought further to be mentioned that Euler saw that the inner nature of\ngravitation must ultimately be referred to an \u201cinclination and desire\u201d\n(thus will) peculiar to material bodies (in the 68th letter to the\nPrincess). Indeed, it is just this that makes him averse to the conception\nof gravitation as it existed for Newton, and he is inclined to try a\nmodification of it in accordance with the earlier Cartesian theory, and so\nto derive gravitation from the impact of an ether upon the bodies, as\nbeing \u201cmore rational and more suitable for persons who like clear and\nintelligible principles.\u201d He wishes to banish attraction from physics as a\n_qualitas occulta_. This is only in keeping with the dead view of nature\nwhich prevailed at Euler\u2019s time as the correlative of the immaterial soul.\nIt is only worth noticing because of its bearing upon the fundamental\ntruth established by me, which even at that time this fine intellect saw\nglimmering in the distance. He hastened to turn in time, and then, in his\nanxiety at seeing all the prevalent fundamental views endangered, he\nsought safety in the old and already exploded absurdities.\nWe know that _multiplicity_ in general is necessarily conditioned by space\nand time, and is only thinkable in them. In this respect they are called\nthe _principium individuationis_. But we have found that space and time\nare forms of the principle of sufficient reason. In this principle all our\nknowledge _a priori_ is expressed, but, as we showed above, this _a\npriori_ knowledge, as such, only applies to the knowableness of things,\nnot to the things themselves, _i.e._, it is only our form of knowledge, it\nis not a property of the thing-in-itself. The thing-in-itself is, as such,\nfree from all forms of knowledge, even the most universal, that of being\nan object for the subject. In other words, the thing-in-itself is\nsomething altogether different from the idea. If, now, this\nthing-in-itself is _the will_, as I believe I have fully and convincingly\nproved it to be, then, regarded as such and apart from its manifestation,\nit lies outside time and space, and therefore knows no multiplicity, and\nis consequently _one_. Yet, as I have said, it is not one in the sense in\nwhich an individual or a concept is one, but as something to which the\ncondition of the possibility of multiplicity, the _principium\nindividuationis_, is foreign. The multiplicity of things in space and\ntime, which collectively constitute the objectification of will, does not\naffect the will itself, which remains indivisible notwithstanding it. It\nis not the case that, in some way or other, a smaller part of will is in\nthe stone and a larger part in the man, for the relation of part and whole\nbelongs exclusively to space, and has no longer any meaning when we go\nbeyond this form of intuition or perception. The more and the less have\napplication only to the phenomenon of will, that is, its visibility, its\nobjectification. Of this there is a higher grade in the plant than in the\nstone; in the animal a higher grade than in the plant: indeed, the passage\nof will into visibility, its objectification, has grades as innumerable as\nexist between the dimmest twilight and the brightest sunshine, the loudest\nsound and the faintest echo. We shall return later to the consideration of\nthese grades of visibility which belong to the objectification of the\nwill, to the reflection of its nature. But as the grades of its\nobjectification do not directly concern the will itself, still less is it\nconcerned by the multiplicity of the phenomena of these different grades,\n_i.e._, the multitude of individuals of each form, or the particular\nmanifestations of each force. For this multiplicity is directly\nconditioned by time and space, into which the will itself never enters.\nThe will reveals itself as completely and as much in _one_ oak as in\nmillions. Their number and multiplication in space and time has no meaning\nwith regard to it, but only with regard to the multiplicity of individuals\nwho know in space and time, and who are themselves multiplied and\ndispersed in these. The multiplicity of these individuals itself belongs\nnot to the will, but only to its manifestation. We may therefore say that\nif, _per impossibile_, a single real existence, even the most\ninsignificant, were to be entirely annihilated, the whole world would\nnecessarily perish with it. The great mystic Angelus Silesius feels this\nwhen he says\u2014\n\u201cI know God cannot live an instant without me,\nHe must give up the ghost if I should cease to be.\u201d\nMen have tried in various ways to bring the immeasurable greatness of the\nmaterial universe nearer to the comprehension of us all, and then they\nhave seized the opportunity to make edifying remarks. They have referred\nperhaps to the relative smallness of the earth, and indeed of man; or, on\nthe contrary, they have pointed out the greatness of the mind of this man\nwho is so insignificant\u2014the mind that can solve, comprehend, and even\nmeasure the greatness of the universe, and so forth. Now, all this is very\nwell, but to me, when I consider the vastness of the world, the most\nimportant point is this, that the thing-in-itself, whose manifestation is\nthe world\u2014whatever else it may be\u2014cannot have its true self spread out and\ndispersed after this fashion in boundless space, but that this endless\nextension belongs only to its manifestation. The thing-in-itself, on the\ncontrary, is present entire and undivided in every object of nature and in\nevery living being. Therefore we lose nothing by standing still beside any\nsingle individual thing, and true wisdom is not to be gained by measuring\nout the boundless world, or, what would be more to the purpose, by\nactually traversing endless space. It is rather to be attained by the\nthorough investigation of any individual thing, for thus we seek to arrive\nat a full knowledge and understanding of its true and peculiar nature.\nThe subject which will therefore be fully considered in the next book, and\nwhich has, doubtless, already presented itself to the mind of every\nstudent of Plato, is, that these different grades of the objectification\nof will which are manifested in innumerable individuals, and exist as\ntheir unattained types or as the eternal forms of things, not entering\nthemselves into time and space, which are the medium of individual things,\nbut remaining fixed, subject to no change, always being, never becoming,\nwhile the particular things arise and pass away, always become and never\nare,\u2014that these _grades of the objectification of will_ are, I say, simply\n_Plato\u2019s Ideas_. I make this passing reference to the matter here in order\nthat I may be able in future to use the word _Idea_ in this sense. In my\nwritings, therefore, the word is always to be understood in its true and\noriginal meaning given to it by Plato, and has absolutely no reference to\nthose abstract productions of dogmatising scholastic reason, which Kant\nhas inaptly and illegitimately used this word to denote, though Plato had\nalready appropriated and used it most fitly. By Idea, then, I understand\nevery definite and fixed grade of the objectification of will, so far as\nit is thing-in-itself, and therefore has no multiplicity. These grades are\nrelated to individual things as their eternal forms or prototypes. The\nshortest and most concise statement of this famous Platonic doctrine is\ngiven us by Diogenes Laertes (iii. 12): \u201c\u1f41 \u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9, \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c2\n\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f11\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u1fbd \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\n\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u201d\u2014(\u201c_Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit\nsubsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem\nconsistentia_\u201d). Of Kant\u2019s misuse of the word I take no further notice;\nwhat it is needful to say about it will be found in the Appendix.\n\u00a7 26. The lowest grades of the objectification of will are to be found in\nthose most universal forces of nature which partly appear in all matter\nwithout exception, as gravity and impenetrability, and partly have shared\nthe given matter among them, so that certain of them reign in one species\nof matter and others in another species, constituting its specific\ndifference, as rigidity, fluidity, elasticity, electricity, magnetism,\nchemical properties and qualities of every kind. They are in themselves\nimmediate manifestations of will, just as much as human action; and as\nsuch they are groundless, like human character. Only their particular\nmanifestations are subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason,\nlike the particular actions of men. They themselves, on the other hand,\ncan never be called either effect or cause, but are the prior and\npresupposed conditions of all causes and effects through which their real\nnature unfolds and reveals itself. It is therefore senseless to demand a\ncause of gravity or electricity, for they are original forces. Their\nexpressions, indeed, take place in accordance with the law of cause and\neffect, so that every one of their particular manifestations has a cause,\nwhich is itself again just a similar particular manifestation which\ndetermines that this force must express itself here, must appear in space\nand time; but the force itself is by no means the effect of a cause, nor\nthe cause of an effect. It is therefore a mistake to say \u201cgravity is the\ncause of a stone falling;\u201d for the cause in this case is rather the\nnearness of the earth, because it attracts the stone. Take the earth away\nand the stone will not fall, although gravity remains. The force itself\nlies quite outside the chain of causes and effects, which presupposes\ntime, because it only has meaning in relation to it; but the force lies\noutside time. The individual change always has for its cause another\nchange just as individual as itself, and not the force of which it is the\nexpression. For that which always gives its efficiency to a cause, however\nmany times it may appear, is a force of nature. As such, it is groundless,\n_i.e._, it lies outside the chain of causes and outside the province of\nthe principle of sufficient reason in general, and is philosophically\nknown as the immediate objectivity of will, which is the \u201cin-itself\u201d of\nthe whole of nature; but in etiology, which in this reference is physics,\nit is set down as an original force, _i.e._, a _qualitas occulta_.\nIn the higher grades of the objectivity of will we see individuality\noccupy a prominent position, especially in the case of man, where it\nappears as the great difference of individual characters, _i.e._, as\ncomplete personality, outwardly expressed in strongly marked individual\nphysiognomy, which influences the whole bodily form. None of the brutes\nhave this individuality in anything like so high a degree, though the\nhigher species of them have a trace of it; but the character of the\nspecies completely predominates over it, and therefore they have little\nindividual physiognomy. The farther down we go, the more completely is\nevery trace of the individual character lost in the common character of\nthe species, and the physiognomy of the species alone remains. We know the\nphysiological character of the species, and from that we know exactly what\nis to be expected from the individual; while, on the contrary, in the\nhuman species every individual has to be studied and fathomed for himself,\nwhich, if we wish to forecast his action with some degree of certainty,\nis, on account of the possibility of concealment that first appears with\nreason, a matter of the greatest difficulty. It is probably connected with\nthis difference of the human species from all others, that the folds and\nconvolutions of the brain, which are entirely wanting in birds, and very\nweakly marked in rodents, are even in the case of the higher animals far\nmore symmetrical on both sides, and more constantly the same in each\nindividual, than in the case of human beings.(34) It is further to be\nregarded as a phenomenon of this peculiar individual character which\ndistinguishes men from all the lower animals, that in the case of the\nbrutes the sexual instinct seeks its satisfaction without observable\nchoice of objects, while in the case of man this choice is, in a purely\ninstinctive manner and independent of all reflection, carried so far that\nit rises into a powerful passion. While then every man is to be regarded\nas a specially determined and characterised phenomenon of will, and indeed\nto a certain extent as a special Idea, in the case of the brutes this\nindividual character as a whole is wanting, because only the species has a\nspecial significance. And the farther we go from man, the fainter becomes\nthe trace of this individual character, so that plants have no individual\nqualities left, except such as may be fully explained from the favourable\nor unfavourable external influences of soil, climate, and other accidents.\nFinally, in the inorganic kingdom of nature all individuality disappears.\nThe crystal alone is to be regarded as to a certain extent individual. It\nis a unity of the tendency in definite directions, fixed by\ncrystallisation, which makes the trace of this tendency permanent. It is\nat the same time a cumulative repetition of its primitive form, bound into\nunity by an idea, just as the tree is an aggregate of the single\ngerminating fibre which shows itself in every rib of the leaves, in every\nleaf, in every branch; which repeats itself, and to some extent makes each\nof these appear as a separate growth, nourishing itself from the greater\nas a parasite, so that the tree, resembling the crystal, is a systematic\naggregate of small plants, although only the whole is the complete\nexpression of an individual Idea, _i.e._, of this particular grade of the\nobjectification of will. But the individuals of the same species of\ncrystal can have no other difference than such as is produced by external\naccidents; indeed we can make at pleasure large or small crystals of every\nspecies. The individual, however, as such, that is, with traces of an\nindividual character, does not exist further in unorganised nature. All\nits phenomena are expressions of general forces of nature, _i.e._, of\nthose grades of the objectification of will which do not objectify\nthemselves (as is the case in organised nature), by means of the\ndifference of the individualities which collectively express the whole of\nthe Idea, but show themselves only in the species, and as a whole, without\nany variation in each particular example of it. Time, space, multiplicity,\nand existence conditioned by causes, do not belong to the will or to the\nIdea (the grade of the objectification of will), but only to their\nparticular phenomena. Therefore such a force of nature as, for example,\ngravity or electricity, must show itself as such in precisely the same way\nin all its million phenomena, and only external circumstances can modify\nthese. This unity of its being in all its phenomena, this unchangeable\nconstancy of the appearance of these, whenever, under the guidance of\ncausality, the necessary conditions are present, is called a _law of\nnature_. If such a law is once learned from experience, then the\nphenomenon of that force of nature, the character of which is expressed\nand laid down in it, may be accurately forecast and counted upon. But it\nis just this conformity to law of the phenomena of the lower grades of the\nobjectification of will which gives them such a different aspect from the\nphenomena of the same will in the higher, _i.e._, the more distinct,\ngrades of its objectification, in animals, and in men and their actions,\nwhere the stronger or weaker influence of the individual character and the\nsusceptibility to motives which often remain hidden from the spectator,\nbecause they lie in knowledge, has had the result that the identity of the\ninner nature of the two kinds of phenomena has hitherto been entirely\noverlooked.\nIf we start from the knowledge of the particular, and not from that of the\nIdea, there is something astonishing, and sometimes even terrible, in the\nabsolute uniformity of the laws of nature. It might astonish us that\nnature never once forgets her laws; that if, for example, it has once been\naccording to a law of nature that where certain materials are brought\ntogether under given conditions, a chemical combination will take place,\nor gas will be evolved, or they will go on fire; if these conditions are\nfulfilled, whether by our interposition or entirely by chance (and in this\ncase the accuracy is the more astonishing because unexpected), to-day just\nas well as a thousand years ago, the determined phenomenon will take place\nat once and without delay. We are most vividly impressed with the\nmarvellousness of this fact in the case of rare phenomena, which only\noccur under very complex circumstances, but which we are previously\ninformed will take place if these conditions are fulfilled. For example,\nwhen we are told that if certain metals, when arranged alternately in\nfluid with which an acid has been mixed, are brought into contact, silver\nleaf brought between the extremities of this combination will suddenly be\nconsumed in a green flame; or that under certain conditions the hard\ndiamond turns into carbonic acid. It is the ghostly omnipresence of\nnatural forces that astonishes us in such cases, and we remark here what\nin the case of phenomena which happen daily no longer strikes us, how the\nconnection between cause and effect is really as mysterious as that which\nis imagined between a magic formula and a spirit that must appear when\ninvoked by it. On the other hand, if we have attained to the philosophical\nknowledge that a force of nature is a definite grade of the\nobjectification of will, that is to say, a definite grade of that which we\nrecognise as our own inmost nature, and that this will, in itself, and\ndistinguished from its phenomena and their forms, lies outside time and\nspace, and that, therefore, the multiplicity, which is conditioned by time\nand space, does not belong to it, nor directly to the grade of its\nobjectification, _i.e._, the Idea, but only to the phenomena of the Idea;\nand if we remember that the law of causality has significance only in\nrelation to time and space, inasmuch as it determines the position of the\nmultitude of phenomena of the different Ideas in which the will reveals\nitself, governing the order in which they must appear; if, I say, in this\nknowledge the inner meaning of the great doctrine of Kant has been fully\ngrasped, the doctrine that time, space, and causality do not belong to the\nthing-in-itself, but merely to the phenomenon, that they are only the\nforms of our knowledge, not qualities of things in themselves; then we\nshall understand that this astonishment at the conformity to law and\naccurate operation of a force of nature, this astonishment at the complete\nsameness of all its million phenomena and the infallibility of their\noccurrence, is really like that of a child or a savage who looks for the\nfirst time through a glass with many facets at a flower, and marvels at\nthe complete similarity of the innumerable flowers which he sees, and\ncounts the leaves of each of them separately.\nThus every universal, original force of nature is nothing but a low grade\nof the objectification of will, and we call every such grade an eternal\n_Idea_ in Plato\u2019s sense. But a _law of nature_ is the relation of the Idea\nto the form of its manifestation. This form is time, space, and causality,\nwhich are necessarily and inseparably connected and related to each other.\nThrough time and space the Idea multiplies itself in innumerable\nphenomena, but the order according to which it enters these forms of\nmultiplicity is definitely determined by the law of causality; this law is\nas it were the norm of the limit of these phenomena of different Ideas, in\naccordance with which time, space, and matter are assigned to them. This\nnorm is therefore necessarily related to the identity of the aggregate of\nexisting matter, which is the common substratum of all those different\nphenomena. If all these were not directed to that common matter in the\npossession of which they must be divided, there would be no need for such\na law to decide their claims. They might all at once and together fill a\nboundless space throughout an endless time. Therefore, because all these\nphenomena of the eternal Ideas are directed to one and the same matter,\nmust there be a rule for their appearance and disappearance; for if there\nwere not, they would not make way for each other. Thus the law of\ncausality is essentially bound up with that of the permanence of\nsubstance; they reciprocally derive significance from each other. Time and\nspace, again, are related to them in the same way. For time is merely the\npossibility of conflicting states of the same matter, and space is merely\nthe possibility of the permanence of the same matter under all sorts of\nconflicting states. Accordingly, in the preceding book we explained matter\nas the union of space and time, and this union shows itself as change of\nthe accidents in the permanence of the substance, of which causality or\nbecoming is the universal possibility. And accordingly, we said that\nmatter is through and through causality. We explained the understanding as\nthe subjective correlative of causality, and said matter (and thus the\nwhole world as idea) exists only for the understanding; the understanding\nis its condition, its supporter as its necessary correlative. I repeat all\nthis in passing, merely to call to mind what was demonstrated in the First\nBook, for it is necessary for the complete understanding of these two\nbooks that their inner agreement should be observed, since what is\ninseparably united in the actual world as its two sides, will and idea,\nhas, in order that we might understand each of them more clearly in\nisolation, been dissevered in these two books.\nIt may not perhaps be superfluous to elucidate further by an example how\nthe law of causality has meaning only in relation to time and space, and\nthe matter which consists in the union of the two. For it determines the\nlimits in accordance with which the phenomena of the forces of nature\ndivide themselves in the possession of matter, while the original forces\nof nature, as the immediate objectification of will, which, as a thing in\nitself, is not subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason, lie\noutside these forms, within which alone all etiological explanation has\nvalidity and meaning, and just on that account can never lead us to the\ninner reality of nature. For this purpose let us think of some kind of\nmachine constructed according to the laws of mechanics. Iron weights begin\nthe motion by their gravity; copper wheels resist by their rigidity,\naffect and raise each other and the lever by their impenetrability, and so\non. Here gravity, rigidity, and impenetrability are original unexplained\nforces; mechanics only gives us the condition under which, and the manner\nin which, they manifest themselves, appear, and govern a definite matter,\ntime, and place. If, now, a strong magnet is made to attract the iron of\nthe weight, and overcome its gravity, the movement of the machine stops,\nand the matter becomes forthwith the scene of quite a different force of\nnature\u2014magnetism, of which etiology again gives no further explanation\nthan the condition under which it appears. Or let us suppose that the\ncopper discs of such a machine are laid upon zinc plates, and an acid\nsolution introduced between them. At once the same matter of the machine\nhas become subject to another original force, galvanism, which now governs\nit according to its own laws, and reveals itself in it through its\nphenomena; and etiology can again tell us nothing about this force except\nthe conditions under which, and the laws in accordance with which, it\nmanifests itself. Let us now raise the temperature and add pure acid; the\nwhole machine burns; that is to say, once more an entirely different force\nof nature, chemical energy, asserts at this time and in this place\nirresistible claims to this particular matter, and reveals itself in it as\nIdea, as a definite grade of the objectification of will. The calcined\nmetal thus produced now unites with an acid, and a salt is obtained which\nforms itself into crystals. These are the phenomena of another Idea, which\nin itself is again quite inexplicable, while the appearance of its\nphenomena is dependent upon certain conditions which etiology can give us.\nThe crystals dissolve, mix with other materials, and vegetation springs up\nfrom them\u2014a new phenomenon of will: and so the same permanent matter may\nbe followed _ad infinitum_, to observe how now this and now that natural\nforce obtains a right to it and temporarily takes possession of it, in\norder to appear and reveal its own nature. The condition of this right,\nthe point of time and space at which it becomes valid, is given by\ncausality, but the explanation founded upon this law only extends thus\nfar. The force itself is a manifestation of will, and as such is not\nsubject to the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, that is, it is\ngroundless. It lies outside all time, is omnipresent, and seems as it were\nto wait constantly till the circumstances occur under which it can appear\nand take possession of a definite matter, supplanting the forces which\nhave reigned in it till then. All time exists only for the phenomena of\nsuch a force, and is without significance for the force itself. Through\nthousands of years chemical forces slumber in matter till the contact with\nthe reagents sets them free; then they appear; but time exists only for\nthe phenomena, not for the forces themselves. For thousands of years\ngalvanism slumbered in copper and zinc, and they lay quietly beside\nsilver, which must be consumed in flame as soon as all three are brought\ntogether under the required conditions. Even in the organic kingdom we see\na dry seed preserve the slumbering force through three thousand years, and\nwhen at last the favourable circumstances occur, grow up as a plant.(35)\nIf by this exposition the difference between a force of nature and all its\nphenomena has been made quite distinct; if we have seen clearly that the\nformer is the will itself at this particular grade of its objectification,\nbut that multiplicity comes to phenomena only through time and space, and\nthat the law of causality is nothing but the determination of the position\nof these phenomena in time and space; then we shall recognise the complete\ntruth and the deep meaning of Malebranche\u2019s doctrine of occasional causes\n(_causes occasionelles_). It is well worth while comparing this doctrine\nof his, as he explains it in the \u201c_Recherches de la V\u00e9rite_,\u201d both in the\n3rd Chapter of the second part of the 6th Book, and in the\n_\u00e9claircissements_ appended to this chapter, with this exposition of mine,\nand observing the complete agreement of the two doctrines in the case of\nsuch different systems of thought. Indeed I cannot help admiring how\nMalebranche, though thoroughly involved in the positive dogmas which his\nage inevitably forced upon him, yet, in such bonds and under such a\nburden, hit the truth so happily, so correctly, and even knew how to\ncombine it with these dogmas, at all events verbally.\nFor the power of truth is incredibly great and of unspeakable endurance.\nWe find constant traces of it in all, even the most eccentric and absurd\ndogmas, of different times and different lands,\u2014often indeed in strange\ncompany, curiously mixed up with other things, but still recognisable. It\nis like a plant that germinates under a heap of great stones, but still\nstruggles up to the light, working itself through with many deviations and\nwindings, disfigured, worn out, stunted in its growth,\u2014but yet, to the\nlight.\nIn any case Malebranche is right: every natural cause is only an\noccasional cause. It only gives opportunity or occasion for the\nmanifestation of the one indivisible will which is the \u201cin-itself\u201d of all\nthings, and whose graduated objectification is the whole visible world.\nOnly the appearance, the becoming visible, in this place, at this time, is\nbrought about by the cause and is so far dependent on it, but not the\nwhole of the phenomenon, nor its inner nature. This is the will itself, to\nwhich the principle of sufficient reason has not application, and which is\ntherefore groundless. Nothing in the world has a sufficient cause of its\nexistence generally, but only a cause of existence just here and just now.\nThat a stone exhibits now gravity, now rigidity, now electricity, now\nchemical qualities, depends upon causes, upon impressions upon it from\nwithout, and is to be explained from these. But these qualities\nthemselves, and thus the whole inner nature of the stone which consists in\nthem, and therefore manifests itself in all the ways referred to; thus, in\ngeneral, that the stone is such as it is, that it exists generally\u2014all\nthis, I say, has no ground, but is the visible appearance of the\ngroundless will. Every cause is thus an occasional cause. We have found it\nto be so in nature, which is without knowledge, and it is also precisely\nthe same when motives and not causes or stimuli determine the point at\nwhich the phenomena are to appear, that is to say, in the actions of\nanimals and human beings. For in both cases it is one and the same will\nwhich appears; very different in the grades of its manifestation,\nmultiplied in the phenomena of these grades, and, in respect of these,\nsubordinated to the principle of sufficient reason, but in itself free\nfrom all this. Motives do not determine the character of man, but only the\nphenomena of his character, that is, his actions; the outward fashion of\nhis life, not its inner meaning and content. These proceed from the\ncharacter which is the immediate manifestation of the will, and is\ntherefore groundless. That one man is bad and another good, does not\ndepend upon motives or outward influences, such as teaching and preaching,\nand is in this sense quite inexplicable. But whether a bad man shows his\nbadness in petty acts of injustice, cowardly tricks, and low knavery which\nhe practises in the narrow sphere of his circumstances, or whether as a\nconqueror he oppresses nations, throws a world into lamentation, and sheds\nthe blood of millions; this is the outward form of his manifestation, that\nwhich is unessential to it, and depends upon the circumstances in which\nfate has placed him, upon his surroundings, upon external influences, upon\nmotives; but his decision upon these motives can never be explained from\nthem; it proceeds from the will, of which this man is a manifestation. Of\nthis we shall speak in the Fourth Book. The manner in which the character\ndiscloses its qualities is quite analogous to the way in which those of\nevery material body in unconscious nature are disclosed. Water remains\nwater with its intrinsic qualities, whether as a still lake it reflects\nits banks, or leaps in foam from the cliffs, or, artificially confined,\nspouts in a long jet into the air. All that depends upon external causes;\nthe one form is as natural to it as the other, but it will always show the\nsame form in the same circumstances; it is equally ready for any, but in\nevery case true to its character, and at all times revealing this alone.\nSo will every human character under all circumstances reveal itself, but\nthe phenomena which proceed from it will always be in accordance with the\ncircumstances.\n\u00a7 27. If, from the foregoing consideration of the forces of nature and\ntheir phenomena, we have come to see clearly how far an explanation from\ncauses can go, and where it must stop if it is not to degenerate into the\nvain attempt to reduce the content of all phenomena to their mere form, in\nwhich case there would ultimately remain nothing but form, we shall be\nable to settle in general terms what is to be demanded of etiology as a\nwhole. It must seek out the causes of all phenomena in nature, _i.e._, the\ncircumstances under which they invariably appear. Then it must refer the\nmultitude of phenomena which have various forms in various circumstances\nto what is active in every phenomenon, and is presupposed in the\ncause,\u2014original forces of nature. It must correctly distinguish between a\ndifference of the phenomenon which arises from a difference of the force,\nand one which results merely from a difference of the circumstances under\nwhich the force expresses itself; and with equal care it must guard\nagainst taking the expressions of one and the same force under different\ncircumstances for the manifestations of different forces, and conversely\nagainst taking for manifestations of one and the same force what\noriginally belongs to different forces. Now this is the direct work of the\nfaculty of judgment, and that is why so few men are capable of increasing\nour insight in physics, while all are able to enlarge experience.\nIndolence and ignorance make us disposed to appeal too soon to original\nforces. This is exemplified with an exaggeration that savours of irony in\nthe entities and quidities of the schoolmen. Nothing is further from my\ndesire than to favour their resuscitation. We have just as little right to\nappeal to the objectification of will, instead of giving a physical\nexplanation, as we have to appeal to the creative power of God. For\nphysics demands causes, and the will is never a cause. Its whole relation\nto the phenomenon is not in accordance with the principle of sufficient\nreason. But that which in itself is the will exists in another aspect as\nidea; that is to say, is phenomenon. As such, it obeys the laws which\nconstitute the form of the phenomenon. Every movement, for example,\nalthough it is always a manifestation of will, must yet have a cause from\nwhich it is to be explained in relation to a particular time and space;\nthat is, not in general in its inner nature, but as a _particular_\nphenomenon. In the case of the stone, this is a mechanical cause; in that\nof the movement of a man, it is a motive; but in no case can it be\nwanting. On the other hand, the universal common nature of all phenomena\nof one particular kind, that which must be presupposed if the explanation\nfrom causes is to have any sense and meaning, is the general force of\nnature, which, in physics, must remain a _qualitas occulta_, because with\nit the etiological explanation ends and the metaphysical begins. But the\nchain of causes and effects is never broken by an original force to which\nit has been necessary to appeal. It does not run back to such a force as\nif it were its first link, but the nearest link, as well as the remotest,\npresupposes the original force, and could otherwise explain nothing. A\nseries of causes and effects may be the manifestation of the most\ndifferent kinds of forces, whose successive visible appearances are\nconducted through it, as I have illustrated above by the example of a\nmetal machine. But the difference of these original forces, which cannot\nbe referred to each other, by no means breaks the unity of that chain of\ncauses, and the connection between all its links. The etiology and the\nphilosophy of nature never do violence to each other, but go hand in hand,\nregarding the same object from different points of view. Etiology gives an\naccount of the causes which necessarily produce the particular phenomenon\nto be explained. It exhibits, as the foundation of all its explanations,\nthe universal forces which are active in all these causes and effects. It\naccurately defines, enumerates, and distinguishes these forces, and then\nindicates all the different effects in which each force appears, regulated\nby the difference of the circumstances, always in accordance with its own\npeculiar character, which it discloses in obedience to an invariable rule,\ncalled _a law of nature_. When all this has been thoroughly accomplished\nby physics in every particular, it will be complete, and its work will be\ndone. There will then remain no unknown force in unorganised nature, nor\nany effect, which has not been proved to be the manifestation of one of\nthese forces under definite circumstances, in accordance with a law of\nnature. Yet a law of nature remains merely the observed rule according to\nwhich nature invariably proceeds whenever certain definite circumstances\noccur. Therefore a law of nature may be defined as a fact expressed\ngenerally\u2014_un fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9_\u2014and thus a complete enumeration of all the\nlaws of nature would only be a complete register of facts. The\nconsideration of nature as a whole is thus completed in _morphology_,\nwhich enumerates, compares, and arranges all the enduring forms of\norganised nature. Of the causes of the appearance of the individual\ncreature it has little to say, for in all cases this is procreation (the\ntheory of which is a separate matter), and in rare cases the _generatio\n\u00e6quivoca_. But to this last belongs, strictly speaking, the manner in\nwhich all the lower grades of the objectification of will, that is to say,\nphysical and chemical phenomena, appear as individual, and it is precisely\nthe task of etiology to point out the conditions of this appearance.\nPhilosophy, on the other hand, concerns itself only with the universal, in\nnature as everywhere else. The original forces themselves are here its\nobject, and it recognises in them the different grades of the objectivity\nof will, which is the inner nature, the \u201cin-itself\u201d of this world; and\nwhen it regards the world apart from will, it explains it as merely the\nidea of the subject. But if etiology, instead of preparing the way for\nphilosophy, and supplying its doctrines with practical application by\nmeans of instances, supposes that its aim is rather to deny the existence\nof all original forces, except perhaps _one_, the most general, for\nexample, impenetrability, which it imagines it thoroughly understands, and\nconsequently seeks forcibly to refer all the others to it\u2014it forsakes its\nown province and can only give us error instead of truth. The content of\nnature is supplanted by its form, everything is ascribed to the\ncircumstances which work from without, and nothing to the inner nature of\nthe thing. Now if it were possible to succeed by this method, a problem in\narithmetic would ultimately, as we have already remarked, solve the riddle\nof the universe. But this is the method adopted by those, referred to\nabove, who think that all physiological effects ought to be reduced to\nform and combination, this, perhaps, to electricity, and this again to\nchemism, and chemism to mechanism. The mistake of Descartes, for example,\nand of all the Atomists, was of this last description. They referred the\nmovements of the globe to the impact of a fluid, and the qualities of\nmatter to the connection and form of the atoms, and hence they laboured to\nexplain all the phenomena of nature as merely manifestations of\nimpenetrability and cohesion. Although this has been given up, precisely\nthe same error is committed in our own day by the electrical, chemical,\nand mechanical physiologists, who obstinately attempt to explain the whole\nof life and all the functions of the organism from \u201cform and combination.\u201d\nIn Meckel\u2019s \u201cArchiv f\u00fcr Physiologie\u201d (1820, vol. v. p. 185) we still find\nit stated that the aim of physiological explanation is the reduction of\norganic life to the universal forces with which physics deals. Lamarck\nalso, in his \u201c_Philosophie Zoologique_,\u201d explains life as merely the\neffect of warmth and electricity: _le calorique et la mati\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique\nsuffisent parfaitement pour composer ensemble cette cause essentielle de\nla vie_ (p. 16). According to this, warmth and electricity would be the\n\u201cthing-in-itself,\u201d and the world of animals and plants its phenomenal\nappearance. The absurdity of this opinion becomes glaringly apparent at\nthe 306th and following pages of that work. It is well known that all\nthese opinions, that have been so often refuted, have reappeared quite\nrecently with renewed confidence. If we carefully examine the foundation\nof these views, we shall find that they ultimately involve the\npresupposition that the organism is merely an aggregate of phenomena of\nphysical, chemical, and mechanical forces, which have come together here\nby chance, and produced the organism as a freak of nature without further\nsignificance. The organism of an animal or of a human being would\ntherefore be, if considered philosophically, not the exhibition of a\nspecial Idea, that is, not itself immediate objectivity of the will at a\ndefinite higher grade, but in it would appear only those Ideas which\nobjectify the will in electricity, in chemism, and in mechanism. Thus the\norganism would be as fortuitously constructed by the concurrence of these\nforces as the forms of men and beasts in clouds and stalactites, and would\ntherefore in itself be no more interesting than they are. However, we\nshall see immediately how far the application of physical and chemical\nmodes of explanation to the organism may yet, within certain limits, be\nallowable and useful; for I shall explain that the vital force certainly\navails itself of and uses the forces of unorganised nature; yet these\nforces no more constitute the vital force than a hammer and anvil make a\nblacksmith. Therefore even the most simple example of plant life can never\nbe explained from these forces by any theory of capillary attraction and\nendosmose, much less animal life. The following observations will prepare\nthe way for this somewhat difficult discussion.\nIt follows from all that has been said that it is certainly an error on\nthe part of natural science to seek to refer the higher grades of the\nobjectification of will to the lower; for the failure to recognise, or the\ndenial of, original and self-existing forces of nature is just as wrong as\nthe groundless assumption of special forces when what occurs is merely a\npeculiar kind of manifestation of what is already known. Thus Kant rightly\nsays that it would be absurd to hope for a blade of grass from a Newton,\nthat is, from one who reduced the blade of grass to the manifestations of\nphysical and chemical forces, of which it was the chance product, and\ntherefore a mere freak of nature, in which no special Idea appeared,\n_i.e._, the will did not directly reveal itself in it in a higher and\nspecific grade, but just as in the phenomena of unorganised nature and by\nchance in this form. The schoolmen, who certainly would not have allowed\nsuch a doctrine, would rightly have said that it was a complete denial of\nthe _forma substantialis_, and a degradation of it to the _forma\naccidentalis_. For the _forma substantialis_ of Aristotle denotes exactly\nwhat I call the grade of the objectification of will in a thing. On the\nother hand, it is not to be overlooked that in all Ideas, that is, in all\nforces of unorganised, and all forms of organised nature, it is _one and\nthe same_ will that reveals itself, that is to say, which enters the form\nof the idea and passes into _objectivity_. Its unity must therefore be\nalso recognisable through an inner relationship between all its phenomena.\nNow this reveals itself in the higher grades of the objectification of\nwill, where the whole phenomenon is more distinct, thus in the vegetable\nand animal kingdoms, through the universally prevailing analogy of all\nforms, the fundamental type which recurs in all phenomena. This has,\ntherefore, become the guiding principle of the admirable zoological system\nwhich was originated by the French in this century, and it is most\ncompletely established in comparative anatomy as _l\u2019unit\u00e9 de plan_,\n_l\u2019uniformit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment anatomique_. To discover this fundamental type\nhas been the chief concern, or at any rate the praiseworthy endeavour, of\nthe natural philosophers of the school of Schelling, who have in this\nrespect considerable merit, although in many cases their hunt after\nanalogies in nature degenerated into mere conceits. They have, however,\nrightly shown that that general relationship and family likeness exists\nalso in the Ideas of unorganised nature; for example, between electricity\nand magnetism, the identity of which was afterwards established; between\nchemical attraction and gravitation, and so forth. They specially called\nattention to the fact that _polarity_, that is, the sundering of a force\ninto two qualitatively different and opposed activities striving after\nreunion, which also shows itself for the most part in space as a\ndispersion in opposite directions, is a fundamental type of almost all the\nphenomena of nature, from the magnet and the crystal to man himself. Yet\nthis knowledge has been current in China from the earliest times, in the\ndoctrine of opposition of Yin and Yang. Indeed, since all things in the\nworld are the objectification of one and the same will, and therefore in\ntheir inner nature identical, it must not only be the case that there is\nthat unmistakable analogy between them, and that in every phenomenon the\ntrace, intimation, and plan of the higher phenomenon that lies next to it\nin point of development shows itself, but also because all these forms\nbelong to the world as _idea_, it is indeed conceivable that even in the\nmost universal forms of the idea, in that peculiar framework of the\nphenomenal world space and time, it may be possible to discern and\nestablish the fundamental type, intimation, and plan of what fills the\nforms. It seems to have been a dim notion of this that was the origin of\nthe Cabala and all the mathematical philosophy of the Pythagoreans, and\nalso of the Chinese in Y-king. In the school of Schelling also, to which\nwe have already referred, we find, among their efforts to bring to light\nthe similarity among the phenomena of nature, several attempts (though\nrather unfortunate ones) to deduce laws of nature from the laws of pure\nspace and time. However, one can never tell to what extent a man of genius\nwill realise both endeavours.\nNow, although the difference between phenomenon and thing-in-itself is\nnever lost sight of, and therefore the identity of the will which\nobjectifies itself in all Ideas can never (because it has different grades\nof its objectification) be distorted to mean identity of the particular\nIdeas themselves in which it appears, so that, for example, chemical or\nelectrical attraction can never be reduced to the attraction of\ngravitation, although this inner analogy is known, and the former may be\nregarded as, so to speak, higher powers of the latter, just as little does\nthe similarity of the construction of all animals warrant us in mixing and\nidentifying the species and explaining the more developed as mere\nvariations of the less developed; and although, finally, the physiological\nfunctions are never to be reduced to chemical or physical processes, yet,\nin justification of this procedure, within certain limits, we may accept\nthe following observations as highly probable.\nIf several of the phenomena of will in the lower grades of its\nobjectification\u2014that is, in unorganised nature\u2014come into conflict because\neach of them, under the guidance of causality, seeks to possess a given\nportion of matter, there arises from the conflict the phenomenon of a\nhigher Idea which prevails over all the less developed phenomena\npreviously there, yet in such a way that it allows the essence of these to\ncontinue to exist in a subordinate manner, in that it takes up into itself\nfrom them something which is analogous to them. This process is only\nintelligible from the identity of the will which manifests itself in all\nthe Ideas, and which is always striving after higher objectification. We\nthus see, for example, in the hardening of the bones, an unmistakable\nanalogy to crystallisation, as the force which originally had possession\nof the chalk, although ossification is never to be reduced to\ncrystallisation. The analogy shows itself in a weaker degree in the flesh\nbecoming firm. The combination of humours in the animal body and secretion\nare also analogous to chemical combination and separation. Indeed, the\nlaws of chemistry are still strongly operative in this case, but\nsubordinated, very much modified, and mastered by a higher Idea; therefore\nmere chemical forces outside the organism will never afford us such\nhumours; but\n\u201cEncheiresin natur\u00e6 nennt es die Chemie,\nSpottet ihrer selbst und weiss nicht wie.\u201d\nThe more developed Idea resulting from this victory over several lower\nIdeas or objectifications of will, gains an entirely new character by\ntaking up into itself from every Idea over which it has prevailed a\nstrengthened analogy. The will objectifies itself in a new, more distinct\nway. It originally appears in _generatio \u00e6quivoca_; afterwards in\nassimilation to the given germ, organic moisture, plant, animal, man. Thus\nfrom the strife of lower phenomena the higher arise, swallowing them all\nup, but yet realising in the higher grade the tendency of all the lower.\nHere, then, already the law applies\u2014_Serpens nisi serpentem comederit non\nfit draco._\nI wish it had been possible for me to dispel by clearness of explanation\nthe obscurity which clings to the subject of these thoughts; but I see\nvery well that the reader\u2019s own consideration of the matter must\nmaterially aid me if I am not to remain uncomprehended or misunderstood.\nAccording to the view I have expressed, the traces of chemical and\nphysical modes of operation will indeed be found in the organism, but it\ncan never be explained from them; because it is by no means a phenomenon\neven accidentally brought about through the united actions of such forces,\nbut a higher Idea which has overcome these lower ideas by _subduing\nassimilation_; for the _one_ will which objectifies itself in all Ideas\nalways seeks the highest possible objectification, and has therefore in\nthis case given up the lower grades of its manifestation after a conflict,\nin order to appear in a higher grade, and one so much the more powerful.\nNo victory without conflict: since the higher Idea or objectification of\nwill can only appear through the conquest of the lower, it endures the\nopposition of these lower Ideas, which, although brought into subjection,\nstill constantly strive to obtain an independent and complete expression\nof their being. The magnet that has attracted a piece of iron carries on a\nperpetual conflict with gravitation, which, as the lower objectification\nof will, has a prior right to the matter of the iron; and in this constant\nbattle the magnet indeed grows stronger, for the opposition excites it, as\nit were, to greater effort. In the same way every manifestation of the\nwill, including that which expresses itself in the human organism, wages a\nconstant war against the many physical and chemical forces which, as lower\nIdeas, have a prior right to that matter. Thus the arm falls which for a\nwhile, overcoming gravity, we have held stretched out; thus the pleasing\nsensation of health, which proclaims the victory of the Idea of the\nself-conscious organism over the physical and chemical laws, which\noriginally governed the humours of the body, is so often interrupted, and\nis indeed always accompanied by greater or less discomfort, which arises\nfrom the resistance of these forces, and on account of which the\nvegetative part of our life is constantly attended by slight pain. Thus\nalso digestion weakens all the animal functions, because it requires the\nwhole vital force to overcome the chemical forces of nature by\nassimilation. Hence also in general the burden of physical life, the\nnecessity of sleep, and, finally, of death; for at last these subdued\nforces of nature, assisted by circumstances, win back from the organism,\nwearied even by the constant victory, the matter it took from them, and\nattain to an unimpeded expression of their being. We may therefore say\nthat every organism expresses the Idea of which it is the image, only\nafter we have subtracted the part of its force which is expended in\nsubduing the lower Ideas that strive with it for matter. This seems to\nhave been running in the mind of Jacob B\u00f6hm when he says somewhere that\nall the bodies of men and animals, and even all plants, are really half\ndead. According as the subjection in the organism of these forces of\nnature, which express the lower grades of the objectification of will, is\nmore or less successful, the more or the less completely does it attain to\nthe expression of its Idea; that is to say, the nearer it is to the\n_ideal_ or the further from it\u2014the _ideal_ of beauty in its species.\nThus everywhere in nature we see strife, conflict, and alternation of\nvictory, and in it we shall come to recognise more distinctly that\nvariance with itself which is essential to the will. Every grade of the\nobjectification of will fights for the matter, the space, and the time of\nthe others. The permanent matter must constantly change its form; for\nunder the guidance of causality, mechanical, physical, chemical, and\norganic phenomena, eagerly striving to appear, wrest the matter from each\nother, for each desires to reveal its own Idea. This strife may be\nfollowed through the whole of nature; indeed nature exists only through\nit: \u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f11\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd \u03b7\u03bd \u1f01\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1, \u1f61\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\n\u0395\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2; (nam si non inesset in rebus contentio, unum omnia essent, ut\nait Empedocles. Aris. Metaph., B. 5). Yet this strife itself is only the\nrevelation of that variance with itself which is essential to the will.\nThis universal conflict becomes most distinctly visible in the animal\nkingdom. For animals have the whole of the vegetable kingdom for their\nfood, and even within the animal kingdom every beast is the prey and the\nfood of another; that is, the matter in which its Idea expresses itself\nmust yield itself to the expression of another Idea, for each animal can\nonly maintain its existence by the constant destruction of some other.\nThus the will to live everywhere preys upon itself, and in different forms\nis its own nourishment, till finally the human race, because it subdues\nall the others, regards nature as a manufactory for its use. Yet even the\nhuman race, as we shall see in the Fourth Book, reveals in itself with\nmost terrible distinctness this conflict, this variance with itself of the\nwill, and we find _homo homini lupus_. Meanwhile we can recognise this\nstrife, this subjugation, just as well in the lower grades of the\nobjectification of will. Many insects (especially ichneumon-flies) lay\ntheir eggs on the skin, and even in the body of the larv\u00e6 of other\ninsects, whose slow destruction is the first work of the newly hatched\nbrood. The young hydra, which grows like a bud out of the old one, and\nafterwards separates itself from it, fights while it is still joined to\nthe old one for the prey that offers itself, so that the one snatches it\nout of the mouth of the other (Trembley, Polypod., ii. p. 110, and iii. p.\n165). But the bulldog-ant of Australia affords us the most extraordinary\nexample of this kind; for if it is cut in two, a battle begins between the\nhead and the tail. The head seizes the tail with its teeth, and the tail\ndefends itself bravely by stinging the head: the battle may last for half\nan hour, until they die or are dragged away by other ants. This contest\ntakes place every time the experiment is tried. (From a letter by Howitt\nin the W. Journal, reprinted in Galignani\u2019s Messenger, 17th November\n1855.) On the banks of the Missouri one sometimes sees a mighty oak the\nstem and branches of which are so encircled, fettered, and interlaced by a\ngigantic wild vine, that it withers as if choked. The same thing shows\nitself in the lowest grades; for example, when water and carbon are\nchanged into vegetable sap, or vegetables or bread into blood by organic\nassimilation; and so also in every case in which animal secretion takes\nplace, along with the restriction of chemical forces to a subordinate mode\nof activity. This also occurs in unorganised nature, when, for example,\ncrystals in process of formation meet, cross, and mutually disturb each\nother to such an extent that they are unable to assume the pure\ncrystalline form, so that almost every cluster of crystals is an image of\nsuch a conflict of will at this low grade of its objectification; or\nagain, when a magnet forces its magnetism upon iron, in order to express\nits Idea in it; or when galvanism overcomes chemical affinity, decomposes\nthe closest combinations, and so entirely suspends the laws of chemistry\nthat the acid of a decomposed salt at the negative pole must pass to the\npositive pole without combining with the alkalies through which it goes on\nits way, or turning red the litmus paper that touches it. On a large scale\nit shows itself in the relation between the central body and the planet,\nfor although the planet is in absolute dependence, yet it always resists,\njust like the chemical forces in the organism; hence arises the constant\ntension between centripetal and centrifugal force, which keeps the globe\nin motion, and is itself an example of that universal essential conflict\nof the manifestation of will which we are considering. For as every body\nmust be regarded as the manifestation of a will, and as will necessarily\nexpresses itself as a struggle, the original condition of every world that\nis formed into a globe cannot be rest, but motion, a striving forward in\nboundless space without rest and without end. Neither the law of inertia\nnor that of causality is opposed to this: for as, according to the former,\nmatter as such is alike indifferent to rest and motion, its original\ncondition may just as well be the one as the other, therefore if we first\nfind it in motion, we have just as little right to assume that this was\npreceded by a condition of rest, and to inquire into the cause of the\norigin of the motion, as, conversely, if we found it at rest, we would\nhave to assume a previous motion and inquire into the cause of its\nsuspension. It is, therefore, not needful to seek for a first impulse for\ncentrifugal force, for, according to the hypothesis of Kant and Laplace,\nit is, in the case of the planets, the residue of the original rotation of\nthe central body, from which the planets have separated themselves as it\ncontracted. But to this central body itself motion is essential; it always\ncontinues its rotation, and at the same time rushes forward in endless\nspace, or perhaps circulates round a greater central body invisible to us.\nThis view entirely agrees with the conjecture of astronomers that there is\na central sun, and also with the observed advance of our whole solar\nsystem, and perhaps of the whole stellar system to which our sun belongs.\nFrom this we are finally led to assume a general advance of fixed stars,\ntogether with the central sun, and this certainly loses all meaning in\nboundless space (for motion in absolute space cannot be distinguished from\nrest), and becomes, as is already the case from its striving and aimless\nflight, an expression of that nothingness, that failure of all aim, which,\nat the close of this book, we shall be obliged to recognise in the\nstriving of will in all its phenomena. Thus boundless space and endless\ntime must be the most universal and essential forms of the collective\nphenomena of will, which exist for the expression of its whole being.\nLastly, we can recognise that conflict which we are considering of all\nphenomena of will against each other in simple matter regarded as such;\nfor the real characteristic of matter is correctly expressed by Kant as\nrepulsive and attractive force; so that even crude matter has its\nexistence only in the strife of conflicting forces. If we abstract from\nall chemical differences in matter, or go so far back in the chain of\ncauses and effects that as yet there is no chemical difference, there\nremains mere matter,\u2014the world rounded to a globe, whose life, _i.e._,\nobjectification of will, is now constituted by the conflict between\nattractive and repulsive forces, the former as gravitation pressing from\nall sides towards the centre, the latter as impenetrability always\nopposing the former either as rigidity or elasticity; and this constant\npressure and resistance may be regarded as the objectivity of will in its\nvery lowest grade, and even there it expresses its character.\nWe should see the will express itself here in the lowest grade as blind\nstriving, an obscure, inarticulate impulse, far from susceptible of being\ndirectly known. It is the simplest and the weakest mode of its\nobjectification. But it appears as this blind and unconscious striving in\nthe whole of unorganised nature, in all those original forces of which it\nis the work of physics and chemistry to discover and to study the laws,\nand each of which manifests itself to us in millions of phenomena which\nare exactly similar and regular, and show no trace of individual\ncharacter, but are mere multiplicity through space and time, _i.e._,\nthrough the _principium individuationis_, as a picture is multiplied\nthrough the facets of a glass.\nFrom grade to grade objectifying itself more distinctly, yet still\ncompletely without consciousness as an obscure striving force, the will\nacts in the vegetable kingdom also, in which the bond of its phenomena\nconsists no longer properly of causes, but of stimuli; and, finally, also\nin the vegetative part of the animal phenomenon, in the production and\nmaturing of the animal, and in sustaining its inner economy, in which the\nmanifestation of will is still always necessarily determined by stimuli.\nThe ever-ascending grades of the objectification of will bring us at last\nto the point at which the individual that expresses the Idea could no\nlonger receive food for its assimilation through mere movement following\nupon stimuli. For such a stimulus must be waited for, but the food has now\ncome to be of a more special and definite kind, and with the\never-increasing multiplicity of the individual phenomena, the crowd and\nconfusion has become so great that they interfere with each other, and the\nchance of the individual that is moved merely by stimuli and must wait for\nits food would be too unfavourable. From the point, therefore, at which\nthe animal has delivered itself from the egg or the womb in which it\nvegetated without consciousness, its food must be sought out and selected.\nFor this purpose movement following upon motives, and therefore\nconsciousness, becomes necessary, and consequently it appears as an agent,\n\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7, called in at this stage of the objectification of will for the\nconservation of the individual and the propagation of the species. It\nappears represented by the brain or a large ganglion, just as every other\neffort or determination of the will which objectifies itself is\nrepresented by an organ, that is to say, manifests itself for the idea as\nan organ.(36) But with this means of assistance, this \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7, the _world\nas idea_ comes into existence at a stroke, with all its forms, object and\nsubject, time, space, multiplicity, and causality. The world now shows its\nsecond side. Till now _mere will_, it becomes also _idea_, object of the\nknowing subject. The will, which up to this point followed its tendency in\nthe dark with unerring certainty, has at this grade kindled for itself a\nlight as a means which became necessary for getting rid of the\ndisadvantage which arose from the throng and the complicated nature of its\nmanifestations, and which would have accrued precisely to the most perfect\nof them. The hitherto infallible certainty and regularity with which it\nworked in unorganised and merely vegetative nature, rested upon the fact\nthat it alone was active in its original nature, as blind impulse, will,\nwithout assistance, and also without interruption, from a second and\nentirely different world, the world as idea, which is indeed only the\nimage of its own inner being, but is yet of quite another nature, and now\nencroaches on the connected whole of its phenomena. Hence its infallible\ncertainty comes to an end. Animals are already exposed to illusion, to\ndeception. They have, however, merely ideas of perception, no conceptions,\nno reflection, and they are therefore bound to the present; they cannot\nhave regard for the future. It seems as if this knowledge without reason\nwas not in all cases sufficient for its end, and at times required, as it\nwere, some assistance. For the very remarkable phenomenon presents itself,\nthat the blind working of the will and the activity enlightened by\nknowledge encroach in a most astonishing manner upon each other\u2019s spheres\nin two kinds of phenomena. In the one case we find in the very midst of\nthose actions of animals which are guided by perceptive knowledge and its\nmotives one kind of action which is accomplished apart from these, and\nthus through the necessity of the blindly acting will. I refer to those\nmechanical instincts which are guided by no motive or knowledge, and which\nyet have the appearance of performing their work from abstract rational\nmotives. The other case, which is opposed to this, is that in which, on\nthe contrary, the light of knowledge penetrates into the workshop of the\nblindly active will, and illuminates the vegetative functions of the human\norganism. I mean clairvoyance. Finally, when the will has attained to the\nhighest grade of its objectification, that knowledge of the understanding\ngiven to brutes to which the senses supply the data, out of which there\narises mere perception confined to what is immediately present, does not\nsuffice. That complicated, many-sided, imaginative being, man, with his\nmany needs, and exposed as he is to innumerable dangers, must, in order to\nexist, be lighted by a double knowledge; a higher power, as it were, of\nperceptive knowledge must be given him, and also reason, as the faculty of\nframing abstract conceptions. With this there has appeared reflection,\nsurveying the future and the past, and, as a consequence, deliberation,\ncare, the power of premeditated action independent of the present, and\nfinally, the full and distinct consciousness of one\u2019s own deliberate\nvolition as such. Now if with mere knowledge of perception there arose the\npossibility of illusion and deception, by which the previous infallibility\nof the blind striving of will was done away with, so that mechanical and\nother instincts, as expressions of unconscious will, had to lend their\nhelp in the midst of those that were conscious, with the entrance of\nreason that certainty and infallibility of the expressions of will (which\nat the other extreme in unorganised nature appeared as strict conformity\nto law) is almost entirely lost; instinct disappears altogether;\ndeliberation, which is supposed to take the place of everything else,\nbegets (as was shown in the First Book) irresolution and uncertainty; then\nerror becomes possible, and in many cases obstructs the adequate\nobjectification of the will in action. For although in the character the\nwill has already taken its definite and unchangeable bent or direction, in\naccordance with which volition, when occasioned by the presence of a\nmotive, invariably takes place, yet error can falsify its expressions, for\nit introduces illusive motives that take the place of the real ones which\nthey resemble;(37) as, for example, when superstition forces on a man\nimaginary motives which impel him to a course of action directly opposed\nto the way in which the will would otherwise express itself in the given\ncircumstances. Agamemnon slays his daughter; a miser dispenses alms, out\nof pure egotism, in the hope that he will some day receive an\nhundred-fold; and so on.\nThus knowledge generally, rational as well as merely sensuous, proceeds\noriginally from the will itself, belongs to the inner being of the higher\ngrades of its objectification as a mere \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7, a means of supporting the\nindividual and the species, just like any organ of the body. Originally\ndestined for the service of the will for the accomplishment of its aims,\nit remains almost throughout entirely subjected to its service: it is so\nin all brutes and in almost all men. Yet we shall see in the Third Book\nhow in certain individual men knowledge can deliver itself from this\nbondage, throw off its yoke, and, free from all the aims of will, exist\npurely for itself, simply as a clear mirror of the world, which is the\nsource of art. Finally, in the Fourth Book, we shall see how, if this kind\nof knowledge reacts on the will, it can bring about self-surrender,\n_i.e._, resignation, which is the final goal, and indeed the inmost nature\nof all virtue and holiness, and is deliverance from the world.\n\u00a7 28. We have considered the great multiplicity and diversity of the\nphenomena in which the will objectifies itself, and we have seen their\nendless and implacable strife with each other. Yet, according to the whole\ndiscussion up to this point, the will itself, as thing-in-itself, is by no\nmeans included in that multiplicity and change. The diversity of the\n(Platonic) Ideas, _i.e._, grades of objectification, the multitude of\nindividuals in which each of these expresses itself, the struggle of forms\nfor matter,\u2014all this does not concern it, but is only the manner of its\nobjectification, and only through this has an indirect relation to it, by\nvirtue of which it belongs to the expression of the nature of will for the\nidea. As the magic-lantern shows many different pictures, which are all\nmade visible by one and the same light, so in all the multifarious\nphenomena which fill the world together or throng after each other as\nevents, only _one will_ manifests itself, of which everything is the\nvisibility, the objectivity, and which remains unmoved in the midst of\nthis change; it alone is thing-in-itself; all objects are manifestations,\nor, to speak the language of Kant, phenomena. Although in man, as\n(Platonic) Idea, the will finds its clearest and fullest objectification,\nyet man alone could not express its being. In order to manifest the full\nsignificance of the will, the Idea of man would need to appear, not alone\nand sundered from everything else, but accompanied by the whole series of\ngrades, down through all the forms of animals, through the vegetable\nkingdom to unorganised nature. All these supplement each other in the\ncomplete objectification of will; they are as much presupposed by the Idea\nof man as the blossoms of a tree presuppose leaves, branches, stem, and\nroot; they form a pyramid, of which man is the apex. If fond of similes,\none might also say that their manifestations accompany that of man as\nnecessarily as the full daylight is accompanied by all the gradations of\ntwilight, through which, little by little, it loses itself in darkness; or\none might call them the echo of man, and say: Animal and plant are the\ndescending fifth and third of man, the inorganic kingdom is the lower\noctave. The full truth of this last comparison will only become clear to\nus when, in the following book, we attempt to fathom the deep significance\nof music, and see how a connected, progressive melody, made up of high,\nquick notes, may be regarded as in some sense expressing the life and\nefforts of man connected by reflection, while the unconnected complemental\nnotes and the slow bass, which make up the harmony necessary to perfect\nthe music, represent the rest of the animal kingdom and the whole of\nnature that is without knowledge. But of this in its own place, where it\nwill not sound so paradoxical. We find, however, that the _inner\nnecessity_ of the gradation of its manifestations, which is inseparable\nfrom the adequate objectification of the will, is expressed by an _outer\nnecessity_ in the whole of these manifestations themselves, by reason of\nwhich man has need of the beasts for his support, the beasts in their\ngrades have need of each other as well as of plants, which in their turn\nrequire the ground, water, chemical elements and their combinations, the\nplanet, the sun, rotation and motion round the sun, the curve of the\nellipse, &c., &c. At bottom this results from the fact that the will must\nlive on itself, for there exists nothing beside it, and it is a hungry\nwill. Hence arise eager pursuit, anxiety, and suffering.\nIt is only the knowledge of the unity of will as thing-in-itself, in the\nendless diversity and multiplicity of the phenomena, that can afford us\nthe true explanation of that wonderful, unmistakable analogy of all the\nproductions of nature, that family likeness on account of which we may\nregard them as variations on the same ungiven theme. So in like measure,\nthrough the distinct and thoroughly comprehended knowledge of that\nharmony, that essential connection of all the parts of the world, that\nnecessity of their gradation which we have just been considering, we shall\nobtain a true and sufficient insight into the inner nature and meaning of\nthe undeniable _teleology_ of all organised productions of nature, which,\nindeed, we presupposed _a priori_, when considering and investigating\nthem.\nThis _teleology_ is of a twofold description; sometimes an _inner\nteleology_, that is, an agreement of all the parts of a particular\norganism, so ordered that the sustenance of the individual and the species\nresults from it, and therefore presents itself as the end of that\ndisposition or arrangement. Sometimes, however, there is an _outward\nteleology_, a relation of unorganised to organised nature in general, or\nof particular parts of organised nature to each other, which makes the\nmaintenance of the whole of organised nature, or of the particular animal\nspecies, possible, and therefore presents itself to our judgment as the\nmeans to this end.\n_Inner teleology_ is connected with the scheme of our work in the\nfollowing way. If, in accordance with what has been said, all variations\nof form in nature, and all multiplicity of individuals, belong not to the\nwill itself, but merely to its objectivity and the form of this\nobjectivity, it necessarily follows that the will is indivisible and is\npresent as a whole in every manifestation, although the grades of its\nobjectification, the (Platonic) Ideas, are very different from each other.\nWe may, for the sake of simplicity, regard these different Ideas as in\nthemselves individual and simple acts of the will, in which it expresses\nits nature more or less. Individuals, however, are again manifestations of\nthe Ideas, thus of these acts, in time, space, and multiplicity. Now, in\nthe lowest grades of objectivity, such an act (or an Idea) retains its\nunity in the manifestation; while, in order to appear in higher grades, it\nrequires a whole series of conditions and developments in time, which only\ncollectively express its nature completely. Thus, for example the Idea\nthat reveals itself in any general force of nature has always one single\nexpression, although it presents itself differently according to the\nexternal relations that are present: otherwise its identity could not be\nproved, for this is done by abstracting the diversity that arises merely\nfrom external relations. In the same way the crystal has only _one_\nmanifestation of life, crystallisation, which afterwards has its fully\nadequate and exhaustive expression in the rigid form, the corpse of that\nmomentary life. The plant, however, does not express the Idea, whose\nphenomenon it is, at once and through a single manifestation, but in a\nsuccession of developments of its organs in time. The animal not only\ndevelops its organism in the same manner, in a succession of forms which\nare often very different (metamorphosis), but this form itself, although\nit is already objectivity of will at this grade, does not attain to a full\nexpression of its Idea. This expression must be completed through the\nactions of the animal, in which its empirical character, common to the\nwhole species, manifests itself, and only then does it become the full\nrevelation of the Idea, a revelation which presupposes the particular\norganism as its first condition. In the case of man, the empirical\ncharacter is peculiar to every individual (indeed, as we shall see in the\nFourth Book, even to the extent of supplanting entirely the character of\nthe species, through the self-surrender of the whole will). That which is\nknown as the empirical character, through the necessary development in\ntime, and the division into particular actions that is conditioned by it,\nis, when we abstract from this temporal form of the manifestation the\n_intelligible character_, according to the expression of Kant, who shows\nhis undying merit especially in establishing this distinction and\nexplaining the relation between freedom and necessity, _i.e._, between the\nwill as thing-in-itself and its manifestations in time.(38) Thus the\nintelligible character coincides with the Idea, or, more accurately, with\nthe original act of will which reveals itself in it. So far then, not only\nthe empirical character of every man, but also that of every species of\nanimal and plant, and even of every original force of unorganised nature,\nis to be regarded as the manifestation of an intelligible character, that\nis, of a timeless, indivisible act of will. I should like here to draw\nattention in passing to the na\u00efvet\u00e9 with which every plant expresses and\nlays open its whole character in its mere form, reveals its whole being\nand will. This is why the physiognomy of plants is so interesting; while\nin order to know an animal in its Idea, it is necessary to observe the\ncourse of its action. As for man, he must be fully investigated and\ntested, for reason makes him capable of a high degree of dissimulation.\nThe beast is as much more na\u00efve than the man as the plant is more na\u00efve\nthan the beast. In the beast we see the will to live more naked, as it\nwere, than in the man, in whom it is clothed with so much knowledge, and\nis, moreover, so veiled through the capacity for dissimulation, that it is\nalmost only by chance, and here and there, that its true nature becomes\napparent. In the plant it shows itself quite naked, but also much weaker,\nas mere blind striving for existence without end or aim. For the plant\nreveals its whole being at the first glance, and with complete innocence,\nwhich does not suffer from the fact that it carries its organs of\ngeneration exposed to view on its upper surface, though in all animals\nthey have been assigned to the most hidden part. This innocence of the\nplant results from its complete want of knowledge. Guilt does not lie in\nwilling, but in willing with knowledge. Every plant speaks to us first of\nall of its home, of the climate, and the nature of the ground in which it\nhas grown. Therefore, even those who have had little practice easily tell\nwhether an exotic plant belongs to the tropical or the temperate zone, and\nwhether it grows in water, in marshes, on mountain, or on moorland.\nBesides this, however, every plant expresses the special will of its\nspecies, and says something that cannot be uttered in any other tongue.\nBut we must now apply what has been said to the teleological consideration\nof the organism, so far as it concerns its inner design. If in unorganised\nnature the Idea, which is everywhere to be regarded as a single act of\nwill, reveals itself also in a single manifestation which is always the\nsame, and thus one may say that here the empirical character directly\npartakes of the unity of the intelligible, coincides, as it were, with it,\nso that no inner design can show itself here; if, on the contrary, all\norganisms express their Ideas through a series of successive developments,\nconditioned by a multiplicity of co-existing parts, and thus only the sum\nof the manifestations of the empirical character collectively constitute\nthe expression of the intelligible character; this necessary co-existence\nof the parts and succession of the stages of development does not destroy\nthe unity of the appearing Idea, the act of will which expresses itself;\nnay, rather this unity finds its expression in the necessary relation and\nconnection of the parts and stages of development with each other, in\naccordance with the law of causality. Since it is the will which is one,\nindivisible, and therefore entirely in harmony with itself, that reveals\nitself in the whole Idea as in act, its manifestation, although broken up\ninto a number of different parts and conditions, must yet show this unity\nagain in the thorough agreement of all of these. This is effected by a\nnecessary relation and dependence of all the parts upon each other, by\nmeans of which the unity of the Idea is re-established in the\nmanifestation. In accordance with this, we now recognise these different\nparts and functions of the organism as related to each other reciprocally\nas means and end, but the organism itself as the final end of all.\nConsequently, neither the breaking up of the Idea, which in itself is\nsimple, into the multiplicity of the parts and conditions of the organism,\non the one hand, nor, on the other hand, the re-establishment of its unity\nthrough the necessary connection of the parts and functions which arises\nfrom the fact that they are the cause and effect, the means and end, of\neach other, is peculiar and essential to the appearing will as such, to\nthe thing-in-itself, but only to its manifestation in space, time, and\ncausality (mere modes of the principle of sufficient reason, the form of\nthe phenomenon). They belong to the world as idea, not to the world as\nwill; they belong to the way in which the will becomes object, _i.e._,\nidea at this grade of its objectivity. Every one who has grasped the\nmeaning of this discussion\u2014a discussion which is perhaps somewhat\ndifficult\u2014will now fully understand the doctrine of Kant, which follows\nfrom it, that both the design of organised and the conformity to law of\nunorganised nature are only introduced by our understanding, and therefore\nboth belong only to the phenomenon, not to the thing-in-itself. The\nsurprise, which was referred to above, at the infallible constancy of the\nconformity to law of unorganised nature, is essentially the same as the\nsurprise that is excited by design in organised nature; for in both cases\nwhat we wonder at is only the sight of the original unity of the Idea,\nwhich, for the phenomenon, has assumed the form of multiplicity and\ndiversity.(39)\nAs regards the second kind of teleology, according to the division made\nabove, the _outer_ design, which shows itself, not in the inner economy of\nthe organisms, but in the support and assistance they receive from\nwithout, both from unorganised nature and from each other; its general\nexplanation is to be found in the exposition we have just given. For the\nwhole world, with all its phenomena, is the objectivity of the one\nindivisible will, the Idea, which is related to all other Ideas as harmony\nis related to the single voice. Therefore that unity of the will must show\nitself also in the agreement of all its manifestations. But we can very\nmuch increase the clearness of this insight if we go somewhat more closely\ninto the manifestations of that outer teleology and agreement of the\ndifferent parts of nature with each other, an inquiry which will also\nthrow some light on the foregoing exposition. We shall best attain this\nend by considering the following analogy.\nThe character of each individual man, so far as it is thoroughly\nindividual, and not entirely included in that of the species, may be\nregarded as a special Idea, corresponding to a special act of the\nobjectification of will. This act itself would then be his intelligible\ncharacter, and his empirical character would be the manifestation of it.\nThe empirical character is entirely determined through the intelligible,\nwhich is without ground, _i.e._, as thing-in-itself is not subordinated to\nthe principle of sufficient reason (the form of the phenomenon). The\nempirical character must in the course of life afford us the express image\nof the intelligible, and can only become what the nature of the latter\ndemands. But this property extends only to the essential, not to the\nunessential in the course of life to which it applies. To this unessential\nbelong the detailed events and actions which are the material in which the\nempirical character shows itself. These are determined by outward\ncircumstances, which present the motives upon which the character reacts\naccording to its nature; and as they may be very different, the outward\nform of the manifestation of the empirical character, that is, the\ndefinite actual or historical form of the course of life, will have to\naccommodate itself to their influence. Now this form may be very\ndifferent, although what is essential to the manifestation, its content,\nremains the same. Thus, for example it is immaterial whether a man plays\nfor nuts or for crowns; but whether a man cheats or plays fairly, that is\nthe real matter; the latter is determined by the intelligible character,\nthe former by outward circumstances. As the same theme may be expressed in\na hundred different variations, so the same character may be expressed in\na hundred very different lives. But various as the outward influence may\nbe, the empirical character which expresses itself in the course of life\nmust yet, whatever form it takes, accurately objectify the intelligible\ncharacter, for the latter adapts its objectification to the given material\nof actual circumstances. We have now to assume something analogous to the\ninfluence of outward circumstances upon the life that is determined in\nessential matters by the character, if we desire to understand how the\nwill, in the original act of its objectification, determines the various\nIdeas in which it objectifies itself, that is, the different forms of\nnatural existence of every kind, among which it distributes its\nobjectification, and which must therefore necessarily have a relation to\neach other in the manifestation. We must assume that between all these\nmanifestations of the _one_ will there existed a universal and reciprocal\nadaptation and accommodation of themselves to each other, by which,\nhowever, as we shall soon see more clearly, all time-determination is to\nbe excluded, for the Idea lies outside time. In accordance with this,\nevery manifestation must have adapted itself to the surroundings into\nwhich it entered, and these again must have adapted themselves to it,\nalthough it occupied a much later position in time; and we see this\n_consensus natur\u00e6_ everywhere. Every plant is therefore adapted to its\nsoil and climate, every animal to its element and the prey that will be\nits food, and is also in some way protected, to a certain extent, against\nits natural enemy: the eye is adapted to the light and its refrangibility,\nthe lungs and the blood to the air, the air-bladder of fish to water, the\neye of the seal to the change of the medium in which it must see, the\nwater-pouch in the stomach of the camel to the drought of the African\ndeserts, the sail of the nautilus to the wind that is to drive its little\nbark, and so on down to the most special and astonishing outward\nadaptations.(40) We must abstract however here from all temporal\nrelations, for these can only concern the manifestation of the Idea, not\nthe Idea itself. Accordingly this kind of explanation must also be used\nretrospectively, and we must not merely admit that every species\naccommodated itself to the given environment, but also that this\nenvironment itself, which preceded it in time, had just as much regard for\nthe being that would some time come into it. For it is one and the same\nwill that objectifies itself in the whole world; it knows no time, for\nthis form of the principle of sufficient reason does not belong to it, nor\nto its original objectivity, the Ideas, but only to the way in which these\nare known by the individuals who themselves are transitory, _i.e._, to the\nmanifestation of the Ideas. Thus, time has no significance for our present\nexamination of the manner in which the objectification of the will\ndistributes itself among the Ideas, and the Ideas whose _manifestations_\nentered into the course of time earlier, according to the law of\ncausality, to which as phenomena they are subject, have no advantage over\nthose whose manifestation entered later; nay rather, these last are the\ncompletest objectifications of the will, to which the earlier\nmanifestations must adapt themselves just as much as they must adapt\nthemselves to the earlier. Thus the course of the planets, the tendency to\nthe ellipse, the rotation of the earth, the division of land and sea, the\natmosphere, light, warmth, and all such phenomena, which are in nature\nwhat bass is in harmony, adapted themselves in anticipation of the coming\nspecies of living creatures of which they were to become the supporter and\nsustainer. In the same way the ground adapted itself to the nutrition of\nplants, plants adapted themselves to the nutrition of animals, animals to\nthat of other animals, and conversely they all adapted themselves to the\nnutrition of the ground. All the parts of nature correspond to each other,\nfor it is _one_ will that appears in them all, but the course of time is\nquite foreign to its original and only _adequate objectification_ (this\nexpression will be explained in the following book), the Ideas. Even now,\nwhen the species have only to sustain themselves, no longer to come into\nexistence, we see here and there some such forethought of nature extending\nto the future, and abstracting as it were from the process of time, a\nself-adaptation of what is to what is yet to come. The bird builds the\nnest for the young which it does not yet know; the beaver constructs a dam\nthe object of which is unknown to it; ants, marmots, and bees lay in\nprovision for the winter they have never experienced; the spider and the\nant-lion make snares, as if with deliberate cunning, for future unknown\nprey; insects deposit their eggs where the coming brood finds future\nnourishment. In the spring-time the female flower of the di\u0153cian\nvalisneria unwinds the spirals of its stalk, by which till now it was held\nat the bottom of the water, and thus rises to the surface. Just then the\nmale flower, which grows on a short stalk from the bottom, breaks away,\nand so, at the sacrifice of its life, reaches the surface, where it swims\nabout in search of the female. The latter is fructified, and then draws\nitself down again to the bottom by contracting its spirals, and there the\nfruit grows.(41) I must again refer here to the larva of the male\nstag-beetle, which makes the hole in the wood for its metamorphosis as big\nagain as the female does, in order to have room for its future horns. The\ninstinct of animals in general gives us the best illustration of what\nremains of teleology in nature. For as instinct is an action, like that\nwhich is guided by the conception of an end, and yet is entirely without\nthis; so all construction of nature resembles that which is guided by the\nconception of an end, and yet is entirely without it. For in the outer as\nin the inner teleology of nature, what we are obliged to think as means\nand end is, in every case, _the manifestation of the unity of the one will\nso thoroughly agreeing with itself_, which has assumed multiplicity in\nspace and time for our manner of knowing.\nThe reciprocal adaptation and self-accommodation of phenomena that springs\nfrom this unity cannot, however, annul the inner contradiction which\nappears in the universal conflict of nature described above, and which is\nessential to the will. That harmony goes only so far as to render possible\nthe duration of the world and the different kinds of existences in it,\nwhich without it would long since have perished. Therefore it only extends\nto the continuance of the species, and the general conditions of life, but\nnot to that of the individual. If, then, by reason of that harmony and\naccommodation, the _species_ in organised nature and the _universal\nforces_ in unorganised nature continue to exist beside each other, and\nindeed support each other reciprocally, on the other hand, the inner\ncontradiction of the will which objectifies itself in all these ideas\nshows itself in the ceaseless internecine war of the _individuals_ of\nthese species, and in the constant struggle of the _manifestations_ of\nthese natural forces with each other, as we pointed out above. The scene\nand the object of this conflict is matter, which they try to wrest from\neach other, and also space and time, the combination of which through the\nform of causality is, in fact, matter, as was explained in the First\nBook.(42)\n\u00a7 29. I here conclude the second principal division of my exposition, in\nthe hope that, so far as is possible in the case of an entirely new\nthought, which cannot be quite free from traces of the individuality in\nwhich it originated, I have succeeded in conveying to the reader the\ncomplete certainty that this world in which we live and have our being is\nin its whole nature through and through _will_, and at the same time\nthrough and through _idea_: that this idea, as such, already presupposes a\nform, object and subject, is therefore relative; and if we ask what\nremains if we take away this form, and all those forms which are\nsubordinate to it, and which express the principle of sufficient reason,\nthe answer must be that as something _toto genere_ different from idea,\nthis can be nothing but _will_, which is thus properly the\n_thing-in-itself_. Every one finds that he himself is this will, in which\nthe real nature of the world consists, and he also finds that he is the\nknowing subject, whose idea the whole world is, the world which exists\nonly in relation to his consciousness, as its necessary supporter. Every\none is thus himself in a double aspect the whole world, the microcosm;\nfinds both sides whole and complete in himself. And what he thus\nrecognises as his own real being also exhausts the being of the whole\nworld\u2014the macrocosm; thus the world, like man, is through and through\n_will_, and through and through _idea_, and nothing more than this. So we\nsee the philosophy of Thales, which concerned the macrocosm, unite at this\npoint with that of Socrates, which dealt with the microcosm, for the\nobject of both is found to be the same. But all the knowledge that has\nbeen communicated in the two first books will gain greater completeness,\nand consequently greater certainty, from the two following books, in which\nI hope that several questions that have more or less distinctly arisen in\nthe course of our work will also be sufficiently answered.\nIn the meantime _one_ such question may be more particularly considered,\nfor it can only properly arise so long as one has not fully penetrated the\nmeaning of the foregoing exposition, and may so far serve as an\nillustration of it. It is this: Every will is a will towards something,\nhas an object, an end of its willing; what then is the final end, or\ntowards what is that will striving that is exhibited to us as the\nbeing-in-itself of the world? This question rests, like so many others,\nupon the confusion of the thing-in-itself with the manifestation. The\nprinciple of sufficient reason, of which the law of motivation is also a\nform, extends only to the latter, not to the former. It is only of\nphenomena, of individual things, that a ground can be given, never of the\nwill itself, nor of the Idea in which it adequately objectifies itself. So\nthen of every particular movement or change of any kind in nature, a cause\nis to be sought, that is, a condition that of necessity produced it, but\nnever of the natural force itself which is revealed in this and\ninnumerable similar phenomena; and it is therefore simple\nmisunderstanding, arising from want of consideration, to ask for a cause\nof gravity, electricity, and so on. Only if one had somehow shown that\ngravity and electricity were not original special forces of nature, but\nonly the manifestations of a more general force already known, would it be\nallowable to ask for the cause which made this force produce the phenomena\nof gravity or of electricity here. All this has been explained at length\nabove. In the same way every particular act of will of a knowing\nindividual (which is itself only a manifestation of will as the\nthing-in-itself) has necessarily a motive without which that act would\nnever have occurred; but just as material causes contain merely the\ndetermination that at this time, in this place, and in this matter, a\nmanifestation of this or that natural force must take place, so the motive\ndetermines only the act of will of a knowing being, at this time, in this\nplace, and under these circumstances, as a particular act, but by no means\ndetermines that that being wills in general or wills in this manner; this\nis the expression of his intelligible character, which, as will itself,\nthe thing-in-itself, is without ground, for it lies outside the province\nof the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore every man has permanent\naims and motives by which he guides his conduct, and he can always give an\naccount of his particular actions; but if he were asked why he wills at\nall, or why in general he wills to exist, he would have no answer, and the\nquestion would indeed seem to him meaningless; and this would be just the\nexpression of his consciousness that he himself is nothing but will, whose\nwilling stands by itself and requires more particular determination by\nmotives only in its individual acts at each point of time.\nIn fact, freedom from all aim, from all limits, belongs to the nature of\nthe will, which is an endless striving. This was already touched on above\nin the reference to centrifugal force. It also discloses itself in its\nsimplest form in the lowest grade of the objectification of will, in\ngravitation, which we see constantly exerting itself, though a final goal\nis obviously impossible for it. For if, according to its will, all\nexisting matter were collected in one mass, yet within this mass gravity,\never striving towards the centre, would still wage war with\nimpenetrability as rigidity or elasticity. The tendency of matter can\ntherefore only be confined, never completed or appeased. But this is\nprecisely the case with all tendencies of all phenomena of will. Every\nattained end is also the beginning of a new course, and so on _ad\ninfinitum_. The plant raises its manifestation from the seed through the\nstem and the leaf to the blossom and the fruit, which again is the\nbeginning of a new seed, a new individual, that runs through the old\ncourse, and so on through endless time. Such also is the life of the\nanimal; procreation is its highest point, and after attaining to it, the\nlife of the first individual quickly or slowly sinks, while a new life\nensures to nature the endurance of the species and repeats the same\nphenomena. Indeed, the constant renewal of the matter of every organism is\nalso to be regarded as merely the manifestation of this continual pressure\nand change, and physiologists are now ceasing to hold that it is the\nnecessary reparation of the matter wasted in motion, for the possible\nwearing out of the machine can by no means be equivalent to the support it\nis constantly receiving through nourishment. Eternal becoming, endless\nflux, characterises the revelation of the inner nature of will. Finally,\nthe same thing shows itself in human endeavours and desires, which always\ndelude us by presenting their satisfaction as the final end of will. As\nsoon as we attain to them they no longer appear the same, and therefore\nthey soon grow stale, are forgotten, and though not openly disowned, are\nyet always thrown aside as vanished illusions. We are fortunate enough if\nthere still remains something to wish for and to strive after, that the\ngame may be kept up of constant transition from desire to satisfaction,\nand from satisfaction to a new desire, the rapid course of which is called\nhappiness, and the slow course sorrow, and does not sink into that\nstagnation that shows itself in fearful ennui that paralyses life, vain\nyearning without a definite object, deadening languor. According to all\nthis, when the will is enlightened by knowledge, it always knows what it\nwills now and here, never what it wills in general; every particular act\nof will has its end, the whole will has none; just as every particular\nphenomenon of nature is determined by a sufficient cause so far as\nconcerns its appearance in this place at this time, but the force which\nmanifests itself in it has no general cause, for it belongs to the\nthing-in-itself, to the groundless will. The single example of\nself-knowledge of the will as a whole is the idea as a whole, the whole\nworld of perception. It is the objectification, the revelation, the mirror\nof the will. What the will expresses in it will be the subject of our\nfurther consideration.(43)\nTHIRD BOOK. THE WORLD AS IDEA.\nSecond Aspect.

In the First Book the world was explained as mere _idea_, object for\na subject. In the Second Book we considered it from its other side, and\nfound that in this aspect it is _will_, which proved to be simply that\nwhich this world is besides being idea. In accordance with this knowledge\nwe called the world as idea, both as a whole and in its parts, the\n_objectification of will_, which therefore means the will become object,\n_i.e._, idea. Further, we remember that this objectification of will was\nfound to have many definite grades, in which, with gradually increasing\ndistinctness and completeness, the nature of will appears in the idea,\nthat is to say, presents itself as object. In these grades we already\nrecognised the Platonic Ideas, for the grades are just the determined\nspecies, or the original unchanging forms and qualities of all natural\nbodies, both organised and unorganised, and also the general forces which\nreveal themselves according to natural laws. These Ideas, then, as a whole\nexpress themselves in innumerable individuals and particulars, and are\nrelated to these as archetypes to their copies. The multiplicity of such\nindividuals is only conceivable through time and space, their appearing\nand passing away through causality, and in all these forms we recognise\nmerely the different modes of the principle of sufficient reason, which is\nthe ultimate principle of all that is finite, of all individual existence,\nand the universal form of the idea as it appears in the knowledge of the\nindividual as such. The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, does not come\nunder this principle, and has therefore neither multiplicity nor change.\nWhile the individuals in which it expresses itself are innumerable, and\nunceasingly come into being and pass away, it remains unchanged as one and\nthe same, and the principle of sufficient reason has for it no meaning.\nAs, however, this is the form under which all knowledge of the subject\ncomes, so far as the subject knows as an _individual_, the Ideas lie quite\noutside the sphere of its knowledge. If, therefore, the Ideas are to\nbecome objects of knowledge, this can only happen by transcending the\nindividuality of the knowing subject. The more exact and detailed\nexplanation of this is what will now occupy our attention.\n\u00a7 31. First, however, the following very essential remark. I hope that in\nthe preceding book I have succeeded in producing the conviction that what\nis called in the Kantian philosophy the _thing-in-itself_, and appears\nthere as so significant, and yet so obscure and paradoxical a doctrine,\nand especially on account of the manner in which Kant introduced it as an\ninference from the caused to the cause, was considered a stumbling-stone,\nand, in fact, the weak side of his philosophy,\u2014that this, I say, if it is\nreached by the entirely different way by which we have arrived at it, is\nnothing but the _will_ when the sphere of that conception is extended and\ndefined in the way I have shown. I hope, further, that after what has been\nsaid there will be no hesitation in recognising the definite grades of the\nobjectification of the will, which is the inner reality of the world, to\nbe what Plato called the _eternal Ideas_ or unchangeable forms (\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1fc6); a\ndoctrine which is regarded as the principal, but at the same time the most\nobscure and paradoxical dogma of his system, and has been the subject of\nreflection and controversy of ridicule and of reverence to so many and\nsuch differently endowed minds in the course of many centuries.\nIf now the will is for us the _thing-in-itself_, and the Idea is the\nimmediate objectivity of that will at a definite grade, we find that\nKant\u2019s thing-in-itself, and Plato\u2019s Idea, which to him is the only \u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2\n\u03bf\u03bd, these two great obscure paradoxes of the two greatest philosophers of\nthe West are not indeed identical, but yet very closely related, and only\ndistinguished by a single circumstance. The purport of these two great\nparadoxes, with all inner harmony and relationship, is yet so very\ndifferent on account of the remarkable diversity of the individuality of\ntheir authors, that they are the best commentary on each other, for they\nare like two entirely different roads that conduct us to the same goal.\nThis is easily made clear. What Kant says is in substance this:\u2014\u201cTime,\nspace, and causality are not determinations of the thing-in-itself, but\nbelong only to its phenomenal existence, for they are nothing but the\nforms of our knowledge. Since, however, all multiplicity, and all coming\ninto being and passing away, are only possible through time, space, and\ncausality, it follows that they also belong only to the phenomenon, not to\nthe thing-in-itself. But as our knowledge is conditioned by these forms,\nthe whole of experience is only knowledge of the phenomenon, not of the\nthing-in-itself; therefore its laws cannot be made valid for the\nthing-in-itself. This extends even to our own _ego_, and we know it only\nas phenomenon, and not according to what it may be in itself.\u201d This is the\nmeaning and content of the doctrine of Kant in the important respect we\nare considering. What Plato says is this:\u2014\u201cThe things of this world which\nour senses perceive have no true being; _they always become, they never\nare:_ they have only a relative being; they all exist merely in and\nthrough their relations to each other; their whole being may, therefore,\nquite as well be called a non-being. They are consequently not objects of\na true knowledge (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7), for such a knowledge can only be of what\nexists for itself, and always in the same way; they, on the contrary, are\nonly the objects of an opinion based on sensation (\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1fbd \u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5). So long as we are confined to the perception of these, we are\nlike men who sit in a dark cave, bound so fast that they cannot turn their\nheads, and who see nothing but the shadows of real things which pass\nbetween them and a fire burning behind them, the light of which casts the\nshadows on the wall opposite them; and even of themselves and of each\nother they see only the shadows on the wall. Their wisdom would thus\nconsist in predicting the order of the shadows learned from experience.\nThe real archetypes, on the other hand, to which these shadows correspond,\nthe eternal Ideas, the original forms of all things, can alone be said to\nhave true being (\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bd), because they _always are, but never become nor\npass away_. To them belongs _no multiplicity_; for each of them is\naccording to its nature only one, for it is the archetype itself, of which\nall particular transitory things of the same kind which are named after it\nare copies or shadows. They have also _no coming into being nor passing\naway_, for they are truly being, never becoming nor vanishing, like their\nfleeting shadows. (It is necessarily presupposed, however, in these two\nnegative definitions, that time, space, and causality have no significance\nor validity for these Ideas, and that they do not exist in them.) Of these\nonly can there be true knowledge, for the object of such knowledge can\nonly be that which always and in every respect (thus in-itself) is; not\nthat which is and again is not, according as we look at it.\u201d This is\nPlato\u2019s doctrine. It is clear, and requires no further proof that the\ninner meaning of both doctrines is entirely the same; that both explain\nthe visible world as a manifestation, which in itself is nothing, and\nwhich only has meaning and a borrowed reality through that which expresses\nitself in it (in the one case the thing-in-itself, in the other the Idea).\nTo this last, which has true being, all the forms of that phenomenal\nexistence, even the most universal and essential, are, according to both\ndoctrines, entirely foreign. In order to disown these forms Kant has\ndirectly expressed them even in abstract terms, and distinctly refused\ntime, space, and causality as mere forms of the phenomenon to the\nthing-in-itself. Plato, on the other hand, did not attain to the fullest\nexpression, and has only distinctly refused these forms to his Ideas in\nthat he denies of the Ideas what is only possible through these forms,\nmultiplicity of similar things, coming into being and passing away. Though\nit is perhaps superfluous, I should like to illustrate this remarkable and\nimportant agreement by an example. There stands before us, let us suppose,\nan animal in the full activity of life. Plato would say, \u201cThis animal has\nno true existence, but merely an apparent existence, a constant becoming,\na relative existence which may just as well be called non-being as being.\nOnly the Idea which expresses itself in that animal is truly \u2018being,\u2019 or\nthe animal in-itself (\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), which is dependent upon nothing,\nbut is in and for itself (\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1fbd \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf, \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f61\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2); it has not become, it\nwill not end, but always is in the same way (\u03b1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\n\u03b3\u03c5\u03b3\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd). If now we recognise its Idea in this animal,\nit is all one and of no importance whether we have this animal now before\nus or its progenitor of a thousand years ago, whether it is here or in a\ndistant land, whether it presents itself in this or that manner, position,\nor action; whether, lastly, it is this or any other individual of the same\nspecies; all this is nothing, and only concerns the phenomenon; the Idea\nof the animal alone has true being, and is the object of real knowledge.\u201d\nSo Plato; Kant would say something of this kind, \u201cThis animal is a\nphenomenon in time, space, and causality, which are collectively the\nconditions _a priori_ of the possibility of experience, lying in our\nfaculty of knowledge, not determinations of the thing-in-itself. Therefore\nthis animal as we perceive it at this definite point of time, in this\nparticular place, as an individual in the connection of experience\n(_i.e._, in the chain of causes and effects), which has come into being,\nand will just as necessarily pass away, is not a thing-in-itself, but a\nphenomenon which only exists in relation to our knowledge. To know it as\nwhat it may be in itself, that is to say, independent of all the\ndeterminations which lie in time, space, and causality, would demand\nanother kind of knowledge than that which is possible for us through the\nsenses and the understanding.\u201d\nIn order to bring Kant\u2019s mode of expression nearer the Platonic, we might\nsay: Time, space, and causality are that arrangement of our intellect by\nvirtue of which the _one_ being of each kind which alone really is,\nmanifests itself to us as a multiplicity of similar beings, constantly\nappearing and disappearing in endless succession. The apprehension of\nthings by means of and in accordance with this arrangement is _immanent_\nknowledge; that, on the other hand, which is conscious of the true state\nof the case, is _transcendental_ knowledge. The latter is obtained _in\nabstracto_ through the criticism of pure reason, but in exceptional cases\nit may also appear intuitively. This last is an addition of my own, which\nI am endeavouring in this Third Book to explain.\nIf the doctrine of Kant had ever been properly understood and grasped, and\nsince Kant\u2019s time that of Plato, if men had truly and earnestly reflected\non the inner meaning and content of the teaching of these two great\nmasters, instead of involving themselves in the technicalities of the one\nand writing parodies of the style of the other, they could not have failed\nto discern long ago to what an extent these two great philosophers agree,\nand that the true meaning, the aim of both systems, is the same. Not only\nwould they have refrained from constantly comparing Plato to Leibnitz, on\nwhom his spirit certainly did not rest, or indeed to a well-known\ngentleman who is still alive,(44) as if they wanted to mock the manes of\nthe great thinker of the past; but they would have advanced much farther\nin general, or rather they would not have fallen so disgracefully far\nbehind as they have in the last forty years. They would not have let\nthemselves be led by the nose, to-day by one vain boaster and to-morrow by\nanother, nor would they have opened the nineteenth century, which promised\nso much in Germany, with the philosophical farces that were performed over\nthe grave of Kant (as the ancients sometimes did at the funeral obsequies\nof their dead), and which deservedly called forth the derision of other\nnations, for such things least become the earnest and strait-laced German.\nBut so small is the chosen public of true philosophers, that even students\nwho understand are but scantily brought them by the centuries\u2014\u0395\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b7\n\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, \u03b2\u03b1\u03ba\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (_Thyrsigeri quidem multi,\nBaachi vero pauci_). \u1f29 \u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u1fb3 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd, \u1f41\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\n\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f01\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9; \u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f01\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (_Eam ob\nrem philosophia in infamiam incidit, quad non pro dignitate ipsam\nattingunt: neque enim a spuriis, sad a legitimis erat\nattrectanda_).\u2014Plato.\nMen followed the words,\u2014such words as \u201c_a priori_ ideas,\u201d \u201cforms of\nperception and thought existing in consciousness independently of\nexperience,\u201d \u201cfundamental conceptions of the pure understanding,\u201d &c.,\n&c.,\u2014and asked whether Plato\u2019s Ideas, which were also original\nconceptions, and besides this were supposed to be reminiscences of a\nperception before life of the truly real things, were in some way the same\nas Kant\u2019s forms of perception and thought, which lie _a priori_ in our\nconsciousness. On account of some slight resemblance in the expression of\nthese two entirely different doctrines, the Kantian doctrine of the forms\nwhich limit the knowledge of the individual to the phenomenon, and the\nPlatonic doctrine of Ideas, the knowledge of which these very forms\nexpressly deny, these so far diametrically opposed doctrines were\ncarefully compared, and men deliberated and disputed as to whether they\nwere identical, found at last that they were not the same, and concluded\nthat Plato\u2019s doctrine of Ideas and Kant\u2019s \u201cCritique of Reason\u201d had nothing\nin common. But enough of this.(45)\n\u00a7 32. It follows from our consideration of the subject, that, for us, Idea\nand thing-in-itself are not entirely one and the same, in spite of the\ninner agreement between Kant and Plato, and the identity of the aim they\nhad before them, or the conception of the world which roused them and led\nthem to philosophise. The Idea is for us rather the direct, and therefore\nadequate, objectivity of the thing-in-itself, which is, however, itself\nthe _will_\u2014the will as not yet objectified, not yet become idea. For the\nthing-in-itself must, even according to Kant, be free from all the forms\nconnected with knowing as such; and it is merely an error on his part (as\nis shown in the Appendix) that he did not count among these forms, before\nall others, that of being object for a subject, for it is the first and\nmost universal form of all phenomena, _i.e._, of all idea; he should\ntherefore have distinctly denied objective existence to his\nthing-in-itself, which would have saved him from a great inconsistency\nthat was soon discovered. The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, is\nnecessarily object, something known, an idea, and in that respect is\ndifferent from the thing-in-itself, but in that respect only. It has\nmerely laid aside the subordinate forms of the phenomenon, all of which we\ninclude in the principle of sufficient reason, or rather it has not yet\nassumed them; but it has retained the first and most universal form, that\nof the idea in general, the form of being object for a subject. It is the\nforms which are subordinate to this (whose general expression is the\nprinciple of sufficient reason) that multiply the Idea in particular\ntransitory individuals, whose number is a matter of complete indifference\nto the Idea. The principle of sufficient reason is thus again the form\ninto which the Idea enters when it appears in the knowledge of the subject\nas individual. The particular thing that manifests itself in accordance\nwith the principle of sufficient reason is thus only an indirect\nobjectification of the thing-in-itself (which is the will), for between it\nand the thing-in-itself stands the Idea as the only direct objectivity of\nthe will, because it has assumed none of the special forms of knowledge as\nsuch, except that of the idea in general, _i.e._, the form of being object\nfor a subject. Therefore it alone is the most _adequate objectivity_ of\nthe will or thing-in-itself which is possible; indeed it is the whole\nthing-in-itself, only under the form of the idea; and here lies the ground\nof the great agreement between Plato and Kant, although, in strict\naccuracy, that of which they speak is not the same. But the particular\nthings are no really adequate objectivity of the will, for in them it is\nobscured by those forms whose general expression is the principle of\nsufficient reason, but which are conditions of the knowledge which belongs\nto the individual as such. If it is allowable to draw conclusions from an\nimpossible presupposition, we would, in fact, no longer know particular\nthings, nor events, nor change, nor multiplicity, but would comprehend\nonly Ideas,\u2014only the grades of the objectification of that one will, of\nthe thing-in-itself, in pure unclouded knowledge. Consequently our world\nwould be a _nunc stans_, if it were not that, as knowing subjects, we are\nalso individuals, _i.e._, our perceptions come to us through the medium of\na body, from the affections of which they proceed, and which is itself\nonly concrete willing, objectivity of the will, and thus is an object\namong objects, and as such comes into the knowing consciousness in the\nonly way in which an object can, through the forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason, and consequently already presupposes, and therefore\nbrings in, time, and all other forms which that principle expresses. Time\nis only the broken and piecemeal view which the individual being has of\nthe Ideas, which are outside time, and consequently _eternal_. Therefore\nPlato says time is the moving picture of eternity: \u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f41\n\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2.(46)\n\u00a7 33. Since now, as individuals, we have no other knowledge than that\nwhich is subject to the principle of sufficient reason, and this form of\nknowledge excludes the Ideas, it is certain that if it is possible for us\nto raise ourselves from the knowledge of particular things to that of the\nIdeas, this can only happen by an alteration taking place in the subject\nwhich is analogous and corresponds to the great change of the whole nature\nof the object, and by virtue of which the subject, so far as it knows an\nIdea, is no more individual.\nIt will be remembered from the preceding book that knowledge in general\nbelongs to the objectification of will at its higher grades, and\nsensibility, nerves, and brain, just like the other parts of the organised\nbeing, are the expression of the will at this stage of its objectivity,\nand therefore the idea which appears through them is also in the same way\nbound to the service of will as a means (\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7) for the attainment of its\nnow complicated (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1) aims for sustaining a being of manifold\nrequirements. Thus originally and according to its nature, knowledge is\ncompletely subject to the will, and, like the immediate object, which, by\nmeans of the application of the law of causality, is its starting-point,\nall knowledge which proceeds in accordance with the principle of\nsufficient reason remains in a closer or more distant relation to the\nwill. For the individual finds his body as an object among objects, to all\nof which it is related and connected according to the principle of\nsufficient reason. Thus all investigations of these relations and\nconnections lead back to his body, and consequently to his will. Since it\nis the principle of sufficient reason which places the objects in this\nrelation to the body, and, through it, to the will, the one endeavour of\nthe knowledge which is subject to this principle will be to find out the\nrelations in which objects are placed to each other through this\nprinciple, and thus to trace their innumerable connections in space, time,\nand causality. For only through these is the object _interesting_ to the\nindividual, _i.e._, related to the will. Therefore the knowledge which is\nsubject to the will knows nothing further of objects than their relations,\nknows the objects only so far as they exist at this time, in this place,\nunder these circumstances, from these causes, and with these effects\u2014in a\nword, as particular things; and if all these relations were to be taken\naway, the objects would also have disappeared for it, because it knew\nnothing more about them. We must not disguise the fact that what the\nsciences consider in things is also in reality nothing more than this;\ntheir relations, the connections of time and space, the causes of natural\nchanges, the resemblance of forms, the motives of actions,\u2014thus merely\nrelations. What distinguishes science from ordinary knowledge is merely\nits systematic form, the facilitating of knowledge by the comprehension of\nall particulars in the universal, by means of the subordination of\nconcepts, and the completeness of knowledge which is thereby attained. All\nrelation has itself only a relative existence; for example, all being in\ntime is also non-being; for time is only that by means of which opposite\ndeterminations can belong to the same thing; therefore every phenomenon\nwhich is in time again is not, for what separates its beginning from its\nend is only time, which is essentially a fleeting, inconstant, and\nrelative thing, here called duration. But time is the most universal form\nof all objects of the knowledge which is subject to the will, and the\nprototype of its other forms.\nKnowledge now, as a rule, remains always subordinate to the service of the\nwill, as indeed it originated for this service, and grew, so to speak, to\nthe will, as the head to the body. In the case of the brutes this\nsubjection of knowledge to the will can never be abolished. In the case of\nmen it can be abolished only in exceptional cases, which we shall\npresently consider more closely. This distinction between man and brute is\noutwardly expressed by the difference of the relation of the head to the\nbody. In the case of the lower brutes both are deformed: in all brutes the\nhead is directed towards the earth, where the objects of its will lie;\neven in the higher species the head and the body are still far more one\nthan in the case of man, whose head seems freely set upon his body, as if\nonly carried by and not serving it. This human excellence is exhibited in\nthe highest degree by the Apollo of Belvedere; the head of the god of the\nMuses, with eyes fixed on the far distance, stands so freely on his\nshoulders that it seems wholly delivered from the body, and no more\nsubject to its cares.\n\u00a7 34. The transition which we have referred to as possible, but yet to be\nregarded as only exceptional, from the common knowledge of particular\nthings to the knowledge of the Idea, takes place suddenly; for knowledge\nbreaks free from the service of the will, by the subject ceasing to be\nmerely individual, and thus becoming the pure will-less subject of\nknowledge, which no longer traces relations in accordance with the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, but rests in fixed contemplation of the\nobject presented to it, out of its connection with all others, and rises\ninto it.\nA full explanation is necessary to make this clear, and the reader must\nsuspend his surprise for a while, till he has grasped the whole thought\nexpressed in this work, and then it will vanish of itself.\nIf, raised by the power of the mind, a man relinquishes the common way of\nlooking at things, gives up tracing, under the guidance of the forms of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, their relations to each other, the\nfinal goal of which is always a relation to his own will; if he thus\nceases to consider the where, the when, the why, and the whither of\nthings, and looks simply and solely at the _what_; if, further, he does\nnot allow abstract thought, the concepts of the reason, to take possession\nof his consciousness, but, instead of all this, gives the whole power of\nhis mind to perception, sinks himself entirely in this, and lets his whole\nconsciousness be filled with the quiet contemplation of the natural object\nactually present, whether a landscape, a tree, a mountain, a building, or\nwhatever it may be; inasmuch as he _loses_ himself in this object (to use\na pregnant German idiom), _i.e._, forgets even his individuality, his\nwill, and only continues to exist as the pure subject, the clear mirror of\nthe object, so that it is as if the object alone were there, without any\none to perceive it, and he can no longer separate the perceiver from the\nperception, but both have become one, because the whole consciousness is\nfilled and occupied with one single sensuous picture; if thus the object\nhas to such an extent passed out of all relation to something outside it,\nand the subject out of all relation to the will, then that which is so\nknown is no longer the particular thing as such; but it is the _Idea_, the\neternal form, the immediate objectivity of the will at this grade; and,\ntherefore, he who is sunk in this perception is no longer individual, for\nin such perception the individual has lost himself; but he is _pure_,\nwill-less, painless, timeless _subject of knowledge_. This, which in\nitself is so remarkable (which I well know confirms the saying that\noriginated with Thomas Paine, _Du sublime au ridicule il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un\npas_), will by degrees become clearer and less surprising from what\nfollows. It was this that was running in Spinoza\u2019s mind when he wrote:\n_Meus \u00e6terna est, quatenus res sub \u00e6ternitatis specie __ concipit_ (Eth.\nV. pr. 31, Schol.)(47) In such contemplation the particular thing becomes\nat once the _Idea_ of its species, and the perceiving individual becomes\n_pure subject of knowledge_. The individual, as such, knows only\nparticular things; the pure subject of knowledge knows only Ideas. For the\nindividual is the subject of knowledge in its relation to a definite\nparticular manifestation of will, and in subjection to this. This\nparticular manifestation of will is, as such, subordinated to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in all its forms; therefore, all knowledge\nwhich relates itself to it also follows the principle of sufficient\nreason, and no other kind of knowledge is fitted to be of use to the will\nbut this, which always consists merely of relations to the object. The\nknowing individual as such, and the particular things known by him, are\nalways in some place, at some time, and are links in the chain of causes\nand effects. The pure subject of knowledge and his correlative, the Idea,\nhave passed out of all these forms of the principle of sufficient reason:\ntime, place, the individual that knows, and the individual that is known,\nhave for them no meaning. When an individual knower has raised himself in\nthe manner described to be pure subject of knowledge, and at the same time\nhas raised the observed object to the Platonic Idea, the _world as idea_\nappears complete and pure, and the full objectification of the will takes\nplace, for the Platonic Idea alone is its _adequate objectivity_. The Idea\nincludes object and subject in like manner in itself, for they are its one\nform; but in it they are absolutely of equal importance; for as the object\nis here, as elsewhere, simply the idea of the subject, the subject, which\npasses entirely into the perceived object has thus become this object\nitself, for the whole consciousness is nothing but its perfectly distinct\npicture. Now this consciousness constitutes the whole _world as idea_, for\none imagines the whole of the Platonic Ideas, or grades of the objectivity\nof will, in their series passing through it. The particular things of all\ntime and space are nothing but Ideas multiplied through the principle of\nsufficient reason (the form of the knowledge of the individual as such),\nand thus obscured as regards their pure objectivity. When the Platonic\nIdea appears, in it subject and object are no longer to be distinguished,\nfor the Platonic Idea, the adequate objectivity of will, the true world as\nidea, arises only when the subject and object reciprocally fill and\npenetrate each other completely; and in the same way the knowing and the\nknown individuals, as things in themselves, are not to be distinguished.\nFor if we look entirely away from the true _world as idea_, there remains\nnothing but the _world as will_. The will is the \u201cin-itself\u201d of the\nPlatonic Idea, which fully objectifies it; it is also the \u201cin-itself\u201d of\nthe particular thing and of the individual that knows it, which objectify\nit incompletely. As will, outside the idea and all its forms, it is one\nand the same in the object contemplated and in the individual, who soars\naloft in this contemplation, and becomes conscious of himself as pure\nsubject. These two are, therefore, in themselves not different, for in\nthemselves they are will, which here knows itself; and multiplicity and\ndifference exist only as the way in which this knowledge comes to the\nwill, _i.e._, only in the phenomenon, on account of its form, the\nprinciple of sufficient reason.\nNow the known thing, without me as the subject of knowledge, is just as\nlittle an object, and not mere will, blind effort, as without the object,\nwithout the idea, I am a knowing subject and not mere blind will. This\nwill is in itself, _i.e._, outside the idea, one and the same with mine:\nonly in the world as idea, whose form is always at least that of subject\nand object, we are separated as the known and the knowing individual. As\nsoon as knowledge, the world as idea, is abolished, there remains nothing\nbut mere will, blind effort. That it should receive objectivity, become\nidea, supposes at once both subject and object; but that this should be\npure, complete, and adequate objectivity of the will, supposes the object\nas Platonic Idea, free from the forms of the principle of sufficient\nreason, and the subject as the pure subject of knowledge, free from\nindividuality and subjection to the will.\nWhoever now, has, after the manner referred to, become so absorbed and\nlost in the perception of nature that he only continues to exist as the\npure knowing subject, becomes in this way directly conscious that, as\nsuch, he is the condition, that is, the supporter, of the world and all\nobjective existence; for this now shows itself as dependent upon his\nexistence. Thus he draws nature into himself, so that he sees it to be\nmerely an accident of his own being. In this sense Byron says\u2014\n\u201cAre not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part\nOf me and of my soul, as I of them?\u201d\nBut how shall he who feels this, regard himself as absolutely transitory,\nin contrast to imperishable nature? Such a man will rather be filled with\nthe consciousness, which the Upanishad of the Veda expresses: _H\u00e6 omnes\ncreatur\u00e6 in totum ego sum, et pr\u00e6ter me aliud ens non est_ (Oupnek\u2019hat, i.\n122).(48)\n\u00a7 35. In order to gain a deeper insight into the nature of the world, it\nis absolutely necessary that we should learn to distinguish the will as\nthing-in-itself from its adequate objectivity, and also the different\ngrades in which this appears more and more distinctly and fully, _i.e._,\nthe Ideas themselves, from the merely phenomenal existence of these Ideas\nin the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, the restricted method\nof knowledge of the individual. We shall then agree with Plato when he\nattributes actual being only to the Ideas, and allows only an illusive,\ndream-like existence to things in space and time, the real world for the\nindividual. Then we shall understand how one and the same Idea reveals\nitself in so many phenomena, and presents its nature only bit by bit to\nthe individual, one side after another. Then we shall also distinguish the\nIdea itself from the way in which its manifestation appears in the\nobservation of the individual, and recognise the former as essential and\nthe latter as unessential. Let us consider this with the help of examples\ntaken from the most insignificant things, and also from the greatest. When\nthe clouds move, the figures which they form are not essential, but\nindifferent to them; but that as elastic vapour they are pressed together,\ndrifted along, spread out, or torn asunder by the force of the wind: this\nis their nature, the essence of the forces which objectify themselves in\nthem, the Idea; their actual forms are only for the individual observer.\nTo the brook that flows over stones, the eddies, the waves, the\nfoam-flakes which it forms are indifferent and unessential; but that it\nfollows the attraction of gravity, and behaves as inelastic, perfectly\nmobile, formless, transparent fluid: this is its nature; this, _if known\nthrough perception_, is its Idea; these accidental forms are only for us\nso long as we know as individuals. The ice on the window-pane forms itself\ninto crystals according to the laws of crystallisation, which reveal the\nessence of the force of nature that appears here, exhibit the Idea; but\nthe trees and flowers which it traces on the pane are unessential, and are\nonly there for us. What appears in the clouds, the brook, and the crystal\nis the weakest echo of that will which appears more fully in the plant,\nmore fully still in the beast, and most fully in man. But only the\nessential in all these grades of its objectification constitutes the Idea;\non the other hand, its unfolding or development, because broken up in the\nforms of the principle of sufficient reason into a multiplicity of\nmany-sided phenomena, is unessential to the Idea, lies merely in the kind\nof knowledge that belongs to the individual and has reality only for this.\nThe same thing necessarily holds good of the unfolding of that Idea which\nis the completest objectivity of will. Therefore, the history of the human\nrace, the throng of events, the change of times, the multifarious forms of\nhuman life in different lands and countries, all this is only the\naccidental form of the manifestation of the Idea, does not belong to the\nIdea itself, in which alone lies the adequate objectivity of the will, but\nonly to the phenomenon which appears in the knowledge of the individual,\nand is just as foreign, unessential, and indifferent to the Idea itself as\nthe figures which they assume are to the clouds, the form of its eddies\nand foam-flakes to the brook, or its trees and flowers to the ice.\nTo him who has thoroughly grasped this, and can distinguish between the\nwill and the Idea, and between the Idea and its manifestation, the events\nof the world will have significance only so far as they are the letters\nout of which we may read the Idea of man, but not in and for themselves.\nHe will not believe with the vulgar that time may produce something\nactually new and significant; that through it, or in it, something\nabsolutely real may attain to existence, or indeed that it itself as a\nwhole has beginning and end, plan and development, and in some way has for\nits final aim the highest perfection (according to their conception) of\nthe last generation of man, whose life is a brief thirty years. Therefore\nhe will just as little, with Homer, people a whole Olympus with gods to\nguide the events of time, as, with Ossian, he will take the forms of the\nclouds for individual beings; for, as we have said, both have just as much\nmeaning as regards the Idea which appears in them. In the manifold forms\nof human life and in the unceasing change of events, he will regard the\nIdea only as the abiding and essential, in which the will to live has its\nfullest objectivity, and which shows its different sides in the\ncapacities, the passions, the errors and the excellences of the human\nrace; in self-interest, hatred, love, fear, boldness, frivolity,\nstupidity, slyness, wit, genius, and so forth, all of which crowding\ntogether and combining in thousands of forms (individuals), continually\ncreate the history of the great and the little world, in which it is all\nthe same whether they are set in motion by nuts or by crowns. Finally, he\nwill find that in the world it is the same as in the dramas of Gozzi, in\nall of which the same persons appear, with like intention, and with a like\nfate; the motives and incidents are certainly different in each piece, but\nthe spirit of the incidents is the same; the actors in one piece know\nnothing of the incidents of another, although they performed in it\nthemselves; therefore, after all experience of former pieces, Pantaloon\nhas become no more agile or generous, Tartaglia no more conscientious,\nBrighella no more courageous, and Columbine no more modest.\nSuppose we were allowed for once a clearer glance into the kingdom of the\npossible, and over the whole chain of causes and effects; if the\nearth-spirit appeared and showed us in a picture all the greatest men,\nenlighteners of the world, and heroes, that chance destroyed before they\nwere ripe for their work; then the great events that would have changed\nthe history of the world and brought in periods of the highest culture and\nenlightenment, but which the blindest chance, the most insignificant\naccident, hindered at the outset; lastly, the splendid powers of great\nmen, that would have enriched whole ages of the world, but which, either\nmisled by error or passion, or compelled by necessity, they squandered\nuselessly on unworthy or unfruitful objects, or even wasted in play. If we\nsaw all this, we would shudder and lament at the thought of the lost\ntreasures of whole periods of the world. But the earth-spirit would smile\nand say, \u201cThe source from which the individuals and their powers proceed\nis inexhaustible and unending as time and space; for, like these forms of\nall phenomena, they also are only phenomena, visibility of the will. No\nfinite measure can exhaust that infinite source; therefore an undiminished\neternity is always open for the return of any event or work that was\nnipped in the bud. In this world of phenomena true loss is just as little\npossible as true gain. The will alone is; it is the thing in-itself, and\nthe source of all these phenomena. Its self-knowledge and its assertion or\ndenial, which is then decided upon, is the only event in-itself.\u201d(49)\n\u00a7 36. History follows the thread of events; it is pragmatic so far as it\ndeduces them in accordance with the law of motivation, a law that\ndetermines the self-manifesting will wherever it is enlightened by\nknowledge. At the lowest grades of its objectivity, where it still acts\nwithout knowledge, natural science, in the form of etiology, treats of the\nlaws of the changes of its phenomena, and, in the form of morphology, of\nwhat is permanent in them. This almost endless task is lightened by the\naid of concepts, which comprehend what is general in order that we may\ndeduce what is particular from it. Lastly, mathematics treats of the mere\nforms, time and space, in which the Ideas, broken up into multiplicity,\nappear for the knowledge of the subject as individual. All these, of which\nthe common name is science, proceed according to the principle of\nsufficient reason in its different forms, and their theme is always the\nphenomenon, its laws, connections, and the relations which result from\nthem. But what kind of knowledge is concerned with that which is outside\nand independent of all relations, that which alone is really essential to\nthe world, the true content of its phenomena, that which is subject to no\nchange, and therefore is known with equal truth for all time, in a word,\nthe _Ideas_, which are the direct and adequate objectivity of the thing\nin-itself, the will? We answer, _Art_, the work of genius. It repeats or\nreproduces the eternal Ideas grasped through pure contemplation, the\nessential and abiding in all the phenomena of the world; and according to\nwhat the material is in which it reproduces, it is sculpture or painting,\npoetry or music. Its one source is the knowledge of Ideas; its one aim the\ncommunication of this knowledge. While science, following the unresting\nand inconstant stream of the fourfold forms of reason and consequent, with\neach end attained sees further, and can never reach a final goal nor\nattain full satisfaction, any more than by running we can reach the place\nwhere the clouds touch the horizon; art, on the contrary, is everywhere at\nits goal. For it plucks the object of its contemplation out of the stream\nof the world\u2019s course, and has it isolated before it. And this particular\nthing, which in that stream was a small perishing part, becomes to art the\nrepresentative of the whole, an equivalent of the endless multitude in\nspace and time. It therefore pauses at this particular thing; the course\nof time stops; the relations vanish for it; only the essential, the Idea,\nis its object. We may, therefore, accurately define it as the _way of\nviewing things independent of the principle of sufficient reason_, in\nopposition to the way of viewing them which proceeds in accordance with\nthat principle, and which is the method of experience and of science. This\nlast method of considering things may be compared to a line infinitely\nextended in a horizontal direction, and the former to a vertical line\nwhich cuts it at any point. The method of viewing things which proceeds in\naccordance with the principle of sufficient reason is the rational method,\nand it alone is valid and of use in practical life and in science. The\nmethod which looks away from the content of this principle is the method\nof genius, which is only valid and of use in art. The first is the method\nof Aristotle; the second is, on the whole, that of Plato. The first is\nlike the mighty storm, that rushes along without beginning and without\naim, bending, agitating, and carrying away everything before it; the\nsecond is like the silent sunbeam, that pierces through the storm quite\nunaffected by it. The first is like the innumerable showering drops of the\nwaterfall, which, constantly changing, never rest for an instant; the\nsecond is like the rainbow, quietly resting on this raging torrent. Only\nthrough the pure contemplation described above, which ends entirely in the\nobject, can Ideas be comprehended; and the nature of _genius_ consists in\npre-eminent capacity for such contemplation. Now, as this requires that a\nman should entirely forget himself and the relations in which he stands,\n_genius_ is simply the completest _objectivity_, _i.e._, the objective\ntendency of the mind, as opposed to the subjective, which is directed to\none\u2019s own self\u2014in other words, to the will. Thus genius is the faculty of\ncontinuing in the state of pure perception, of losing oneself in\nperception, and of enlisting in this service the knowledge which\noriginally existed only for the service of the will; that is to say,\ngenius is the power of leaving one\u2019s own interests, wishes, and aims\nentirely out of sight, thus of entirely renouncing one\u2019s own personality\nfor a time, so as to remain _pure knowing subject_, clear vision of the\nworld; and this not merely at moments, but for a sufficient length of\ntime, and with sufficient consciousness, to enable one to reproduce by\ndeliberate art what has thus been apprehended, and \u201cto fix in lasting\nthoughts the wavering images that float before the mind.\u201d It is as if,\nwhen genius appears in an individual, a far larger measure of the power of\nknowledge falls to his lot than is necessary for the service of an\nindividual will; and this superfluity of knowledge, being free, now\nbecomes subject purified from will, a clear mirror of the inner nature of\nthe world. This explains the activity, amounting even to disquietude, of\nmen of genius, for the present can seldom satisfy them, because it does\nnot fill their consciousness. This gives them that restless aspiration,\nthat unceasing desire for new things, and for the contemplation of lofty\nthings, and also that longing that is hardly ever satisfied, for men of\nsimilar nature and of like stature, to whom they might communicate\nthemselves; whilst the common mortal, entirely filled and satisfied by the\ncommon present, ends in it, and finding everywhere his like, enjoys that\npeculiar satisfaction in daily life that is denied to genius.\nImagination has rightly been recognised as an essential element of genius;\nit has sometimes even been regarded as identical with it; but this is a\nmistake. As the objects of genius are the eternal Ideas, the permanent,\nessential forms of the world and all its phenomena, and as the knowledge\nof the Idea is necessarily knowledge through perception, is not abstract,\nthe knowledge of the genius would be limited to the Ideas of the objects\nactually present to his person, and dependent upon the chain of\ncircumstances that brought these objects to him, if his imagination did\nnot extend his horizon far beyond the limits of his actual personal\nexistence, and thus enable him to construct the whole out of the little\nthat comes into his own actual apperception, and so to let almost all\npossible scenes of life pass before him in his own consciousness. Further,\nthe actual objects are almost always very imperfect copies of the Ideas\nexpressed in them; therefore the man of genius requires imagination in\norder to see in things, not that which Nature has actually made, but that\nwhich she endeavoured to make, yet could not because of that conflict of\nher forms among themselves which we referred to in the last book. We shall\nreturn to this farther on in treating of sculpture. The imagination then\nextends the intellectual horizon of the man of genius beyond the objects\nwhich actually present themselves to him, both as regards quality and\nquantity. Therefore extraordinary strength of imagination accompanies, and\nis indeed a necessary condition of genius. But the converse does not hold,\nfor strength of imagination does not indicate genius; on the contrary, men\nwho have no touch of genius may have much imagination. For as it is\npossible to consider a real object in two opposite ways, purely\nobjectively, the way of genius grasping its Idea, or in the common way,\nmerely in the relations in which it stands to other objects and to one\u2019s\nown will, in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, it is\nalso possible to perceive an imaginary object in both of these ways.\nRegarded in the first way, it is a means to the knowledge of the Idea, the\ncommunication of which is the work of art; in the second case, the\nimaginary object is used to build castles in the air congenial to egotism\nand the individual humour, and which for the moment delude and gratify;\nthus only the relations of the phantasies so linked together are known.\nThe man who indulges in such an amusement is a dreamer; he will easily\nmingle those fancies that delight his solitude with reality, and so unfit\nhimself for real life: perhaps he will write them down, and then we shall\nhave the ordinary novel of every description, which entertains those who\nare like him and the public at large, for the readers imagine themselves\nin the place of the hero, and then find the story very agreeable.\nThe common mortal, that manufacture of Nature which she produces by the\nthousand every day, is, as we have said, not capable, at least not\ncontinuously so, of observation that in every sense is wholly\ndisinterested, as sensuous contemplation, strictly so called, is. He can\nturn his attention to things only so far as they have some relation to his\nwill, however indirect it may be. Since in this respect, which never\ndemands anything but the knowledge of relations, the abstract conception\nof the thing is sufficient, and for the most part even better adapted for\nuse; the ordinary man does not linger long over the mere perception, does\nnot fix his attention long on one object, but in all that is presented to\nhim hastily seeks merely the concept under which it is to be brought, as\nthe lazy man seeks a chair, and then it interests him no further. This is\nwhy he is so soon done with everything, with works of art, objects of\nnatural beauty, and indeed everywhere with the truly significant\ncontemplation of all the scenes of life. He does not linger; only seeks to\nknow his own way in life, together with all that might at any time become\nhis way. Thus he makes topographical notes in the widest sense; over the\nconsideration of life itself as such he wastes no time. The man of genius,\non the other hand, whose excessive power of knowledge frees it at times\nfrom the service of will, dwells on the consideration of life itself,\nstrives to comprehend the Idea of each thing, not its relations to other\nthings; and in doing this he often forgets to consider his own path in\nlife, and therefore for the most part pursues it awkwardly enough. While\nto the ordinary man his faculty of knowledge is a lamp to lighten his\npath, to the man of genius it is the sun which reveals the world. This\ngreat diversity in their way of looking at life soon becomes visible in\nthe outward appearance both of the man of genius and of the ordinary\nmortal. The man in whom genius lives and works is easily distinguished by\nhis glance, which is both keen and steady, and bears the stamp of\nperception, of contemplation. This is easily seen from the likenesses of\nthe few men of genius whom Nature has produced here and there among\ncountless millions. On the other hand, in the case of an ordinary man, the\ntrue object of his contemplation, what he is prying into, can be easily\nseen from his glance, if indeed it is not quite stupid and vacant, as is\ngenerally the case. Therefore the expression of genius in a face consists\nin this, that in it a decided predominance of knowledge over will is\nvisible, and consequently there also shows itself in it a knowledge that\nis entirely devoid of relation to will, _i.e._, _pure knowing_. On the\ncontrary, in ordinary countenances there is a predominant expression of\nwill; and we see that knowledge only comes into activity under the impulse\nof will, and thus is directed merely by motives.\nSince the knowledge that pertains to genius, or the knowledge of Ideas, is\nthat knowledge which does not follow the principle of sufficient reason,\nso, on the other hand, the knowledge which does follow that principle is\nthat which gives us prudence and rationality in life, and which creates\nthe sciences. Thus men of genius are affected with the deficiencies\nentailed in the neglect of this latter kind of knowledge. Yet what I say\nin this regard is subject to the limitation that it only concerns them in\nso far as and while they are actually engaged in that kind of knowledge\nwhich is peculiar to genius; and this is by no means at every moment of\ntheir lives, for the great though spontaneous exertion which is demanded\nfor the comprehension of Ideas free from will must necessarily relax, and\nthere are long intervals during which men of genius are placed in very\nmuch the same position as ordinary mortals, both as regards advantages and\ndeficiencies. On this account the action of genius has always been\nregarded as an inspiration, as indeed the name indicates, as the action of\na superhuman being distinct from the individual himself, and which takes\npossession of him only periodically. The disinclination of men of genius\nto direct their attention to the content of the principle of sufficient\nreason will first show itself, with regard to the ground of being, as\ndislike of mathematics; for its procedure is based upon the most universal\nforms of the phenomenon space and time, which are themselves merely modes\nof the principle of sufficient reason, and is consequently precisely the\nopposite of that method of thought which seeks merely the content of the\nphenomenon, the Idea which expresses itself in it apart from all\nrelations. The logical method of mathematics is also antagonistic to\ngenius, for it does not satisfy but obstructs true insight, and presents\nmerely a chain of conclusions in accordance with the principle of the\nground of knowing. The mental faculty upon which it makes the greatest\nclaim is memory, for it is necessary to recollect all the earlier\npropositions which are referred to. Experience has also proved that men of\ngreat artistic genius have no faculty for mathematics; no man was ever\nvery distinguished for both. Alfieri relates that he was never able to\nunderstand the fourth proposition of Euclid. Goethe was constantly\nreproached with his want of mathematical knowledge by the ignorant\nopponents of his theory of colours. Here certainly, where it was not a\nquestion of calculation and measurement upon hypothetical data, but of\ndirect knowledge by the understanding of causes and effects, this reproach\nwas so utterly absurd and inappropriate, that by making it they have\nexposed their entire want of judgment, just as much as by the rest of\ntheir ridiculous arguments. The fact that up to the present day, nearly\nhalf a century after the appearance of Goethe\u2019s theory of colours, even in\nGermany the Newtonian fallacies still have undisturbed possession of the\nprofessorial chair, and men continue to speak quite seriously of the seven\nhomogeneous rays of light and their different refrangibility, will some\nday be numbered among the great intellectual peculiarities of men\ngenerally, and especially of Germans. From the same cause as we have\nreferred to above, may be explained the equally well-known fact that,\nconversely, admirable mathematicians have very little susceptibility for\nworks of fine art. This is very na\u00efvely expressed in the well-known\nanecdote of the French mathematician, who, after having read Racine\u2019s\n\u201cIphigenia,\u201d shrugged his shoulders and asked, \u201c_Qu\u2019est ce que cela\nprouve?_\u201d Further, as quick comprehension of relations in accordance with\nthe laws of causality and motivation is what specially constitutes\nprudence or sagacity, a prudent man, so far as and while he is so, will\nnot be a genius, and a man of genius, so far as and while he is so, will\nnot be a prudent man. Lastly, perceptive knowledge generally, in the\nprovince of which the Idea always lies, is directly opposed to rational or\nabstract knowledge, which is guided by the principle of the ground of\nknowing. It is also well known that we seldom find great genius united\nwith pre-eminent reasonableness; on the contrary, persons of genius are\noften subject to violent emotions and irrational passions. But the ground\nof this is not weakness of reason, but partly unwonted energy of that\nwhole phenomenon of will\u2014the man of genius\u2014which expresses itself through\nthe violence of all his acts of will, and partly preponderance of the\nknowledge of perception through the senses and understanding over abstract\nknowledge, producing a decided tendency to the perceptible, the\nexceedingly lively impressions of which so far outshine colourless\nconcepts, that they take their place in the guidance of action, which\nconsequently becomes irrational. Accordingly the impression of the present\nmoment is very strong with such persons, and carries them away into\nunconsidered action, violent emotions and passions. Moreover, since, in\ngeneral, the knowledge of persons of genius has to some extent freed\nitself from the service of will, they will not in conversation think so\nmuch of the person they are addressing as of the thing they are speaking\nabout, which is vividly present to them; and therefore they are likely to\njudge or narrate things too objectively for their own interests; they will\nnot pass over in silence what would more prudently be concealed, and so\nforth. Finally, they are given to soliloquising, and in general may\nexhibit certain weaknesses which are actually akin to madness. It has\noften been remarked that there is a side at which genius and madness\ntouch, and even pass over into each other, and indeed poetical inspiration\nhas been called a kind of madness: _amabilis insania_, Horace calls it\n(Od. iii. 4), and Wieland in the introduction to \u201cOberon\u201d speaks of it as\n\u201camiable madness.\u201d Even Aristotle, as quoted by Seneca (De Tranq. Animi,\n15, 16), is reported to have said: _Nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura\ndementi\u00e6 fuit_. Plato expresses it in the figure of the dark cave,\nreferred to above (De Rep. 7), when he says: \u201cThose who, outside the cave,\nhave seen the true sunlight and the things that have true being (Ideas),\ncannot afterwards see properly down in the cave, because their eyes are\nnot accustomed to the darkness; they cannot distinguish the shadows, and\nare jeered at for their mistakes by those who have never left the cave and\nits shadows.\u201d In the \u201cPh\u00e6drus\u201d also (p. 317), he distinctly says that\nthere can be no true poet without a certain madness; in fact, (p. 327),\nthat every one appears mad who recognises the eternal Ideas in fleeting\nthings. Cicero also quotes: _Negat enim sine furore, Democritus, quemquam\npoetam magnum esse posse; quod idem dicit Plato_ (De Divin., i. 37). And,\nlastly, Pope says\u2014\n\u201cGreat wits to madness sure are near allied,\nAnd thin partitions do their bounds divide.\u201d\nEspecially instructive in this respect is Goethe\u2019s \u201cTorquato Tasso,\u201d in\nwhich he shows us not only the suffering, the martyrdom of genius as such,\nbut also how it constantly passes into madness. Finally, the fact of the\ndirect connection of genius and madness is established by the biographies\nof great men of genius, such as Rousseau, Byron, and Alfieri, and by\nanecdotes from the lives of others. On the other hand, I must mention\nthat, by a diligent search in lunatic asylums, I have found individual\ncases of patients who were unquestionably endowed with great talents, and\nwhose genius distinctly appeared through their madness, which, however,\nhad completely gained the upper hand. Now this cannot be ascribed to\nchance, for on the one hand the number of mad persons is relatively very\nsmall, and on the other hand a person of genius is a phenomenon which is\nrare beyond all ordinary estimation, and only appears in nature as the\ngreatest exception. It will be sufficient to convince us of this if we\ncompare the number of really great men of genius that the whole of\ncivilised Europe has produced, both in ancient and modern times, with the\ntwo hundred and fifty millions who are always living in Europe, and who\nchange entirely every thirty years. In estimating the number of men of\noutstanding genius, we must of course only count those who have produced\nworks which have retained through all time an enduring value for mankind.\nI shall not refrain from mentioning, that I have known some persons of\ndecided, though not remarkable, mental superiority, who also showed a\nslight trace of insanity. It might seem from this that every advance of\nintellect beyond the ordinary measure, as an abnormal development,\ndisposes to madness. In the meantime, however, I will explain as briefly\nas possible my view of the purely intellectual ground of the relation\nbetween genius and madness, for this will certainly assist the explanation\nof the real nature of genius, that is to say, of that mental endowment\nwhich alone can produce genuine works of art. But this necessitates a\nbrief explanation of madness itself.(50)\nA clear and complete insight into the nature of madness, a correct and\ndistinct conception of what constitutes the difference between the sane\nand the insane, has, as far as I know, not as yet been found. Neither\nreason nor understanding can be denied to madmen, for they talk and\nunderstand, and often draw very accurate conclusions; they also, as a\nrule, perceive what is present quite correctly, and apprehend the\nconnection between cause and effect. Visions, like the phantasies of\ndelirium, are no ordinary symptom of madness: delirium falsifies\nperception, madness the thoughts. For the most part, madmen do not err in\nthe knowledge of what is immediately _present_; their raving always\nrelates to what is _absent_ and _past_, and only through these to their\nconnection with what is present. Therefore it seems to me that their\nmalady specially concerns the memory; not indeed that memory fails them\nentirely, for many of them know a great deal by heart, and sometimes\nrecognise persons whom they have not seen for a long time; but rather that\nthe thread of memory is broken, the continuity of its connection\ndestroyed, and no uniformly connected recollection of the past is\npossible. Particular scenes of the past are known correctly, just like the\nparticular present; but there are gaps in their recollection which they\nfill up with fictions, and these are either always the same, in which case\nthey become fixed ideas, and the madness that results is called monomania\nor melancholy; or they are always different, momentary fancies, and then\nit is called folly, _fatuitas_. This is why it is so difficult to find out\ntheir former life from lunatics when they enter an asylum. The true and\nthe false are always mixed up in their memory. Although the immediate\npresent is correctly known, it becomes falsified through its fictitious\nconnection with an imaginary past; they therefore regard themselves and\nothers as identical with persons who exist only in their imaginary past;\nthey do not recognise some of their acquaintances at all, and thus while\nthey perceive correctly what is actually present, they have only false\nconceptions of its relations to what is absent. If the madness reaches a\nhigh degree, there is complete absence of memory, so that the madman is\nquite incapable of any reference to what is absent or past, and is only\ndetermined by the caprice of the moment in connection with the fictions\nwhich, in his mind, fill the past. In such a case, we are never for a\nmoment safe from violence or murder, unless we constantly make the madman\naware of the presence of superior force. The knowledge of the madman has\nthis in common with that of the brute, both are confined to the present.\nWhat distinguishes them is that the brute has really no idea of the past\nas such, though the past acts upon it through the medium of custom, so\nthat, for example, the dog recognises its former master even after years,\nthat is to say, it receives the wonted impression at the sight of him; but\nof the time that has passed since it saw him it has no recollection. The\nmadman, on the other hand, always carries about in his reason an abstract\npast, but it is a false past, which exists only for him, and that either\nconstantly, or only for the moment. The influence of this false past\nprevents the use of the true knowledge of the present which the brute is\nable to make. The fact that violent mental suffering or unexpected and\nterrible calamities should often produce madness, I explain in the\nfollowing manner. All such suffering is as an actual event confined to the\npresent. It is thus merely transitory, and is consequently never\nexcessively heavy; it only becomes unendurably great when it is lasting\npain; but as such it exists only in thought, and therefore lies in the\n_memory_. If now such a sorrow, such painful knowledge or reflection, is\nso bitter that it becomes altogether unbearable, and the individual is\nprostrated under it, then, terrified Nature seizes upon _madness_ as the\nlast resource of life; the mind so fearfully tortured at once destroys the\nthread of its memory, fills up the gaps with fictions, and thus seeks\nrefuge in madness from the mental suffering that exceeds its strength,\njust as we cut off a mortified limb and replace it with a wooden one. The\ndistracted Ajax, King Lear, and Ophelia may be taken as examples; for the\ncreations of true genius, to which alone we can refer here, as universally\nknown, are equal in truth to real persons; besides, in this case, frequent\nactual experience shows the same thing. A faint analogy of this kind of\ntransition from pain to madness is to be found in the way in which all of\nus often seek, as it were mechanically, to drive away a painful thought\nthat suddenly occurs to us by some loud exclamation or quick movement\u2014to\nturn ourselves from it, to distract our minds by force.\nWe see, from what has been said, that the madman has a true knowledge of\nwhat is actually present, and also of certain particulars of the past, but\nthat he mistakes the connection, the relations, and therefore falls into\nerror and talks nonsense. Now this is exactly the point at which he comes\ninto contact with the man of genius; for he also leaves out of sight the\nknowledge of the connection of things, since he neglects that knowledge of\nrelations which conforms to the principle of sufficient reason, in order\nto see in things only their Ideas, and to seek to comprehend their true\nnature, which manifests itself to perception, and in regard to which _one\nthing_ represents its whole species, in which way, as Goethe says, one\ncase is valid for a thousand. The particular object of his contemplation,\nor the present which is perceived by him with extraordinary vividness,\nappear in so strong a light that the other links of the chain to which\nthey belong are at once thrown into the shade, and this gives rise to\nphenomena which have long been recognised as resembling those of madness.\nThat which in particular given things exists only incompletely and\nweakened by modifications, is raised by the man of genius, through his way\nof contemplating it, to the Idea of the thing, to completeness: he\ntherefore sees everywhere extremes, and therefore his own action tends to\nextremes; he cannot hit the mean, he lacks soberness, and the result is\nwhat we have said. He knows the Ideas completely but not the individuals.\nTherefore it has been said that a poet may know mankind deeply and\nthoroughly, and may yet have a very imperfect knowledge of men. He is\neasily deceived, and is a tool in the hands of the crafty.\n\u00a7 37. Genius, then, consists, according to our explanation, in the\ncapacity for knowing, independently of the principle of sufficient reason,\nnot individual things, which have their existence only in their relations,\nbut the Ideas of such things, and of being oneself the correlative of the\nIdea, and thus no longer an individual, but the pure subject of knowledge.\nYet this faculty must exist in all men in a smaller and different degree;\nfor if not, they would be just as incapable of enjoying works of art as of\nproducing them; they would have no susceptibility for the beautiful or the\nsublime; indeed, these words could have no meaning for them. We must\ntherefore assume that there exists in all men this power of knowing the\nIdeas in things, and consequently of transcending their personality for\nthe moment, unless indeed there are some men who are capable of no\n\u00e6sthetic pleasure at all. The man of genius excels ordinary men only by\npossessing this kind of knowledge in a far higher degree and more\ncontinuously. Thus, while under its influence he retains the presence of\nmind which is necessary to enable him to repeat in a voluntary and\nintentional work what he has learned in this manner; and this repetition\nis the work of art. Through this he communicates to others the Idea he has\ngrasped. This Idea remains unchanged and the same, so that \u00e6sthetic\npleasure is one and the same whether it is called forth by a work of art\nor directly by the contemplation of nature and life. The work of art is\nonly a means of facilitating the knowledge in which this pleasure\nconsists. That the Idea comes to us more easily from the work of art than\ndirectly from nature and the real world, arises from the fact that the\nartist, who knew only the Idea, no longer the actual, has reproduced in\nhis work the pure Idea, has abstracted it from the actual, omitting all\ndisturbing accidents. The artist lets us see the world through his eyes.\nThat he has these eyes, that he knows the inner nature of things apart\nfrom all their relations, is the gift of genius, is inborn; but that he is\nable to lend us this gift, to let us see with his eyes, is acquired, and\nis the technical side of art. Therefore, after the account which I have\ngiven in the preceding pages of the inner nature of \u00e6sthetical knowledge\nin its most general outlines, the following more exact philosophical\ntreatment of the beautiful and the sublime will explain them both, in\nnature and in art, without separating them further. First of all we shall\nconsider what takes place in a man when he is affected by the beautiful\nand the sublime; whether he derives this emotion directly from nature,\nfrom life, or partakes of it only through the medium of art, does not make\nany essential, but merely an external, difference.\n\u00a7 38. In the \u00e6sthetical mode of contemplation we have found _two\ninseparable constituent parts_\u2014the knowledge of the object, not as\nindividual thing but as Platonic Idea, that is, as the enduring form of\nthis whole species of things; and the self-consciousness of the knowing\nperson, not as individual, but as _pure will-less subject of knowledge_.\nThe condition under which both these constituent parts appear always\nunited was found to be the abandonment of the method of knowing which is\nbound to the principle of sufficient reason, and which, on the other hand,\nis the only kind of knowledge that is of value for the service of the will\nand also for science. Moreover, we shall see that the pleasure which is\nproduced by the contemplation of the beautiful arises from these two\nconstituent parts, sometimes more from the one, sometimes more from the\nother, according to what the object of the \u00e6sthetical contemplation may\nbe.\nAll _willing_ arises from want, therefore from deficiency, and therefore\nfrom suffering. The satisfaction of a wish ends it; yet for one wish that\nis satisfied there remain at least ten which are denied. Further, the\ndesire lasts long, the demands are infinite; the satisfaction is short and\nscantily measured out. But even the final satisfaction is itself only\napparent; every satisfied wish at once makes room for a new one; both are\nillusions; the one is known to be so, the other not yet. No attained\nobject of desire can give lasting satisfaction, but merely a fleeting\ngratification; it is like the alms thrown to the beggar, that keeps him\nalive to-day that his misery may be prolonged till the morrow. Therefore,\nso long as our consciousness is filled by our will, so long as we are\ngiven up to the throng of desires with their constant hopes and fears, so\nlong as we are the subject of willing, we can never have lasting happiness\nnor peace. It is essentially all the same whether we pursue or flee, fear\ninjury or seek enjoyment; the care for the constant demands of the will,\nin whatever form it may be, continually occupies and sways the\nconsciousness; but without peace no true well-being is possible. The\nsubject of willing is thus constantly stretched on the revolving wheel of\nIxion, pours water into the sieve of the Danaids, is the ever-longing\nTantalus.\nBut when some external cause or inward disposition lifts us suddenly out\nof the endless stream of willing, delivers knowledge from the slavery of\nthe will, the attention is no longer directed to the motives of willing,\nbut comprehends things free from their relation to the will, and thus\nobserves them without personal interest, without subjectivity, purely\nobjectively, gives itself entirely up to them so far as they are ideas,\nbut not in so far as they are motives. Then all at once the peace which we\nwere always seeking, but which always fled from us on the former path of\nthe desires, comes to us of its own accord, and it is well with us. It is\nthe painless state which Epicurus prized as the highest good and as the\nstate of the gods; for we are for the moment set free from the miserable\nstriving of the will; we keep the Sabbath of the penal servitude of\nwilling; the wheel of Ixion stands still.\nBut this is just the state which I described above as necessary for the\nknowledge of the Idea, as pure contemplation, as sinking oneself in\nperception, losing oneself in the object, forgetting all individuality,\nsurrendering that kind of knowledge which follows the principle of\nsufficient reason, and comprehends only relations; the state by means of\nwhich at once and inseparably the perceived particular thing is raised to\nthe Idea of its whole species, and the knowing individual to the pure\nsubject of will-less knowledge, and as such they are both taken out of the\nstream of time and all other relations. It is then all one whether we see\nthe sun set from the prison or from the palace.\nInward disposition, the predominance of knowing over willing, can produce\nthis state under any circumstances. This is shown by those admirable Dutch\nartists who directed this purely objective perception to the most\ninsignificant objects, and established a lasting monument of their\nobjectivity and spiritual peace in their pictures of _still life_, which\nthe \u00e6sthetic beholder does not look on without emotion; for they present\nto him the peaceful, still, frame of mind of the artist, free from will,\nwhich was needed to contemplate such insignificant things so objectively,\nto observe them so attentively, and to repeat this perception so\nintelligently; and as the picture enables the onlooker to participate in\nthis state, his emotion is often increased by the contrast between it and\nthe unquiet frame of mind, disturbed by vehement willing, in which he\nfinds himself. In the same spirit, landscape-painters, and particularly\nRuisdael, have often painted very insignificant country scenes, which\nproduce the same effect even more agreeably.\nAll this is accomplished by the inner power of an artistic nature alone;\nbut that purely objective disposition is facilitated and assisted from\nwithout by suitable objects, by the abundance of natural beauty which\ninvites contemplation, and even presses itself upon us. Whenever it\ndiscloses itself suddenly to our view, it almost always succeeds in\ndelivering us, though it may be only for a moment, from subjectivity, from\nthe slavery of the will, and in raising us to the state of pure knowing.\nThis is why the man who is tormented by passion, or want, or care, is so\nsuddenly revived, cheered, and restored by a single free glance into\nnature: the storm of passion, the pressure of desire and fear, and all the\nmiseries of willing are then at once, and in a marvellous manner, calmed\nand appeased. For at the moment at which, freed from the will, we give\nourselves up to pure will-less knowing, we pass into a world from which\neverything is absent that influenced our will and moved us so violently\nthrough it. This freeing of knowledge lifts us as wholly and entirely away\nfrom all that, as do sleep and dreams; happiness and unhappiness have\ndisappeared; we are no longer individual; the individual is forgotten; we\nare only pure subject of knowledge; we are only that _one_ eye of the\nworld which looks out from all knowing creatures, but which can become\nperfectly free from the service of will in man alone. Thus all difference\nof individuality so entirely disappears, that it is all the same whether\nthe perceiving eye belongs to a mighty king or to a wretched beggar; for\nneither joy nor complaining can pass that boundary with us. So near us\nalways lies a sphere in which we escape from all our misery; but who has\nthe strength to continue long in it? As soon as any single relation to our\nwill, to our person, even of these objects of our pure contemplation,\ncomes again into consciousness, the magic is at an end; we fall back into\nthe knowledge which is governed by the principle of sufficient reason; we\nknow no longer the Idea, but the particular thing, the link of a chain to\nwhich we also belong, and we are again abandoned to all our woe. Most men\nremain almost always at this standpoint because they entirely lack\nobjectivity, _i.e._, genius. Therefore they have no pleasure in being\nalone with nature; they need company, or at least a book. For their\nknowledge remains subject to their will; they seek, therefore, in objects,\nonly some relation to their will, and whenever they see anything that has\nno such relation, there sounds within them, like a ground bass in music,\nthe constant inconsolable cry, \u201cIt is of no use to me;\u201d thus in solitude\nthe most beautiful surroundings have for them a desolate, dark, strange,\nand hostile appearance.\nLastly, it is this blessedness of will-less perception which casts an\nenchanting glamour over the past and distant, and presents them to us in\nso fair a light by means of self-deception. For as we think of days long\ngone by, days in which we lived in a distant place, it is only the objects\nwhich our fancy recalls, not the subject of will, which bore about with it\nthen its incurable sorrows just as it bears them now; but they are\nforgotten, because since then they have often given place to others. Now,\nobjective perception acts with regard to what is remembered just as it\nwould in what is present, if we let it have influence over us, if we\nsurrendered ourselves to it free from will. Hence it arises that,\nespecially when we are more than ordinarily disturbed by some want, the\nremembrance of past and distant scenes suddenly flits across our minds\nlike a lost paradise. The fancy recalls only what was objective, not what\nwas individually subjective, and we imagine that that objective stood\nbefore us then just as pure and undisturbed by any relation to the will as\nits image stands in our fancy now; while in reality the relation of the\nobjects to our will gave us pain then just as it does now. We can deliver\nourselves from all suffering just as well through present objects as\nthrough distant ones whenever we raise ourselves to a purely objective\ncontemplation of them, and so are able to bring about the illusion that\nonly the objects are present and not we ourselves. Then, as the pure\nsubject of knowledge, freed from the miserable self, we become entirely\none with these objects, and, for the moment, our wants are as foreign to\nus as they are to them. The world as idea alone remains, and the world as\nwill has disappeared.\nIn all these reflections it has been my object to bring out clearly the\nnature and the scope of the subjective element in \u00e6sthetic pleasure; the\ndeliverance of knowledge from the service of the will, the forgetting of\nself as an individual, and the raising of the consciousness to the pure\nwill-less, timeless, subject of knowledge, independent of all relations.\nWith this subjective side of \u00e6sthetic contemplation, there must always\nappear as its necessary correlative the objective side, the intuitive\ncomprehension of the Platonic Idea. But before we turn to the closer\nconsideration of this, and to the achievements of art in relation to it,\nit is better that we should pause for a little at the subjective side of\n\u00e6sthetic pleasure, in order to complete our treatment of this by\nexplaining the impression of the _sublime_ which depends altogether upon\nit, and arises from a modification of it. After that we shall complete our\ninvestigation of \u00e6sthetic pleasure by considering its objective side.\nBut we must first add the following remarks to what has been said. Light\nis the pleasantest and most gladdening of things; it has become the symbol\nof all that is good and salutary. In all religions it symbolises\nsalvation, while darkness symbolises damnation. Ormuzd dwells in the\npurest light, Ahrimines in eternal night. Dante\u2019s Paradise would look very\nmuch like Vauxhall in London, for all the blessed spirits appear as points\nof light and arrange themselves in regular figures. The very absence of\nlight makes us sad; its return cheers us. Colours excite directly a keen\ndelight, which reaches its highest degree when they are transparent. All\nthis depends entirely upon the fact that light is the correlative and\ncondition of the most perfect kind of knowledge of perception, the only\nknowledge which does not in any way affect the will. For sight, unlike the\naffections of the other senses, cannot, in itself, directly and through\nits sensuous effect, make the _sensation_ of the special organ agreeable\nor disagreeable; that is, it has no immediate connection with the will.\nSuch a quality can only belong to the perception which arises in the\nunderstanding, and then it lies in the relation of the object to the will.\nIn the case of hearing this is to some extent otherwise; sounds can give\npain directly, and they may also be sensuously agreeable, directly and\nwithout regard to harmony or melody. Touch, as one with the feeling of the\nwhole body, is still more subordinated to this direct influence upon the\nwill; and yet there is such a thing as a sensation of touch which is\nneither painful nor pleasant. But smells are always either agreeable or\ndisagreeable, and tastes still more so. Thus the last two senses are most\nclosely related to the will, and therefore they are always the most\nignoble, and have been called by Kant the subjective senses. The pleasure\nwhich we experience from light is in fact only the pleasure which arises\nfrom the objective possibility of the purest and fullest perceptive\nknowledge, and as such it may be traced to the fact that pure knowledge,\nfreed and delivered from all will, is in the highest degree pleasant, and\nof itself constitutes a large part of \u00e6sthetic enjoyment. Again, we must\nrefer to this view of light the incredible beauty which we associate with\nthe reflection of objects in water. That lightest, quickest, finest\nspecies of the action of bodies upon each other, that to which we owe by\nfar the completest and purest of our perceptions, the action of reflected\nrays of light, is here brought clearly before our eyes, distinct and\nperfect, in cause and in effect, and indeed in its entirety, hence the\n\u00e6sthetic delight it gives us, which, in the most important aspect, is\nentirely based on the subjective ground of \u00e6sthetic pleasure, and is\ndelight in pure knowing and its method.\n\u00a7 39. All these reflections are intended to bring out the subjective part\nof \u00e6sthetic pleasure; that is to say, that pleasure so far as it consists\nsimply of delight in perceptive knowledge as such, in opposition to will.\nAnd as directly connected with this, there naturally follows the\nexplanation of that disposition or frame of mind which has been called the\nsense of the _sublime_.\nWe have already remarked above that the transition to the state of pure\nperception takes place most easily when the objects bend themselves to it,\nthat is, when by their manifold and yet definite and distinct form they\neasily become representatives of their Ideas, in which beauty, in the\nobjective sense, consists. This quality belongs pre-eminently to natural\nbeauty, which thus affords even to the most insensible at least a fleeting\n\u00e6sthetic satisfaction: indeed it is so remarkable how especially the\nvegetable world invites \u00e6sthetic observation, and, as it were, presses\nitself upon it, that one might say, that these advances are connected with\nthe fact that these organisms, unlike the bodies of animals, are not\nthemselves immediate objects of knowledge, and therefore require the\nassistance of a foreign intelligent individual in order to rise out of the\nworld of blind will and enter the world of idea, and that thus they long,\nas it were, for this entrance, that they may attain at least indirectly\nwhat is denied them directly. But I leave this suggestion which I have\nhazarded, and which borders perhaps upon extravagance, entirely undecided,\nfor only a very intimate and devoted consideration of nature can raise or\njustify it.(51) As long as that which raises us from the knowledge of mere\nrelations subject to the will, to \u00e6sthetic contemplation, and thereby\nexalts us to the position of the subject of knowledge free from will, is\nthis fittingness of nature, this significance and distinctness of its\nforms, on account of which the Ideas individualised in them readily\npresent themselves to us; so long is it merely _beauty_ that affects us\nand the sense of the _beautiful_ that is excited. But if these very\nobjects whose significant forms invite us to pure contemplation, have a\nhostile relation to the human will in general, as it exhibits itself in\nits objectivity, the human body, if they are opposed to it, so that it is\nmenaced by the irresistible predominance of their power, or sinks into\ninsignificance before their immeasurable greatness; if, nevertheless, the\nbeholder does not direct his attention to this eminently hostile relation\nto his will, but, although perceiving and recognising it, turns\nconsciously away from it, forcibly detaches himself from his will and its\nrelations, and, giving himself up entirely to knowledge, quietly\ncontemplates those very objects that are so terrible to the will,\ncomprehends only their Idea, which is foreign to all relation, so that he\nlingers gladly over its contemplation, and is thereby raised above\nhimself, his person, his will, and all will:\u2014in that case he is filled\nwith the sense of the _sublime_, he is in the state of spiritual\nexaltation, and therefore the object producing such a state is called\n_sublime_. Thus what distinguishes the sense of the sublime from that of\nthe beautiful is this: in the case of the beautiful, pure knowledge has\ngained the upper hand without a struggle, for the beauty of the object,\n_i.e._, that property which facilitates the knowledge of its Idea, has\nremoved from consciousness without resistance, and therefore\nimperceptibly, the will and the knowledge of relations which is subject to\nit, so that what is left is the pure subject of knowledge without even a\nremembrance of will. On the other hand, in the case of the sublime that\nstate of pure knowledge is only attained by a conscious and forcible\nbreaking away from the relations of the same object to the will, which are\nrecognised as unfavourable, by a free and conscious transcending of the\nwill and the knowledge related to it.\nThis exaltation must not only be consciously won, but also consciously\nretained, and it is therefore accompanied by a constant remembrance of\nwill; yet not of a single particular volition, such as fear or desire, but\nof human volition in general, so far as it is universally expressed in its\nobjectivity the human body. If a single real act of will were to come into\nconsciousness, through actual personal pressure and danger from the\nobject, then the individual will thus actually influenced would at once\ngain the upper hand, the peace of contemplation would become impossible,\nthe impression of the sublime would be lost, because it yields to the\nanxiety, in which the effort of the individual to right itself has sunk\nevery other thought. A few examples will help very much to elucidate this\ntheory of the \u00e6sthetic sublime and remove all doubt with regard to it; at\nthe same time they will bring out the different degrees of this sense of\nthe sublime. It is in the main identical with that of the beautiful, with\npure will-less knowing, and the knowledge, that necessarily accompanies it\nof Ideas out of all relation determined by the principle of sufficient\nreason, and it is distinguished from the sense of the beautiful only by\nthe additional quality that it rises above the known hostile relation of\nthe object contemplated to the will in general. Thus there come to be\nvarious degrees of the sublime, and transitions from the beautiful to the\nsublime, according as this additional quality is strong, bold, urgent,\nnear, or weak, distant, and merely indicated. I think it is more in\nkeeping with the plan of my treatise, first to give examples of these\ntransitions, and of the weaker degrees of the impression of the sublime,\nalthough persons whose \u00e6sthetical susceptibility in general is not very\ngreat, and whose imagination is not very lively, will only understand the\nexamples given later of the higher and more distinct grades of that\nimpression; and they should therefore confine themselves to these, and\npass over the examples of the very weak degrees of the sublime that are to\nbe given first.\nAs man is at once impetuous and blind striving of will (whose pole or\nfocus lies in the genital organs), and eternal, free, serene subject of\npure knowing (whose pole is the brain); so, corresponding to this\nantithesis, the sun is both the source of _light_, the condition of the\nmost perfect kind of knowledge, and therefore of the most delightful of\nthings\u2014and the source of _warmth_, the first condition of life, _i.e._, of\nall phenomena of will in its higher grades. Therefore, what warmth is for\nthe will, light is for knowledge. Light is the largest gem in the crown of\nbeauty, and has the most marked influence on the knowledge of every\nbeautiful object. Its presence is an indispensable condition of beauty;\nits favourable disposition increases the beauty of the most beautiful.\nArchitectural beauty more than any other object is enhanced by favourable\nlight, though even the most insignificant things become through its\ninfluence most beautiful. If, in the dead of winter, when all nature is\nfrozen and stiff, we see the rays of the setting sun reflected by masses\nof stone, illuminating without warming, and thus favourable only to the\npurest kind of knowledge, not to the will; the contemplation of the\nbeautiful effect of the light upon these masses lifts us, as does all\nbeauty, into a state of pure knowing. But, in this case, a certain\ntranscending of the interests of the will is needed to enable us to rise\ninto the state of pure knowing, because there is a faint recollection of\nthe lack of warmth from these rays, that is, an absence of the principle\nof life; there is a slight challenge to persist in pure knowing, and to\nrefrain from all willing, and therefore it is an example of a transition\nfrom the sense of the beautiful to that of the sublime. It is the faintest\ntrace of the sublime in the beautiful; and beauty itself is indeed present\nonly in a slight degree. The following is almost as weak an example.\nLet us imagine ourselves transported to a very lonely place, with unbroken\nhorizon, under a cloudless sky, trees and plants in the perfectly\nmotionless air, no animals, no men, no running water, the deepest silence.\nSuch surroundings are, as it were, a call to seriousness and\ncontemplation, apart from all will and its cravings; but this is just what\nimparts to such a scene of desolate stillness a touch of the sublime. For,\nbecause it affords no object, either favourable or unfavourable, for the\nwill which is constantly in need of striving and attaining, there only\nremains the state of pure contemplation, and whoever is incapable of this,\nis ignominiously abandoned to the vacancy of unoccupied will, and the\nmisery of ennui. So far it is a test of our intellectual worth, of which,\ngenerally speaking, the degree of our power of enduring solitude, or our\nlove of it, is a good criterion. The scene we have sketched affords us,\nthen, an example of the sublime in a low degree, for in it, with the state\nof pure knowing in its peace and all-sufficiency, there is mingled, by way\nof contrast, the recollection of the dependence and poverty of the will\nwhich stands in need of constant action. This is the species of the\nsublime for which the sight of the boundless prairies of the interior of\nNorth America is celebrated.\nBut let us suppose such a scene, stripped also of vegetation, and showing\nonly naked rocks; then from the entire absence of that organic life which\nis necessary for existence, the will at once becomes uneasy, the desert\nassumes a terrible aspect, our mood becomes more tragic; the elevation to\nthe sphere of pure knowing takes place with a more decided tearing of\nourselves away from the interests of the will; and because we persist in\ncontinuing in the state of pure knowing, the sense of the sublime\ndistinctly appears.\nThe following situation may occasion this feeling in a still higher\ndegree: Nature convulsed by a storm; the sky darkened by black threatening\nthunder-clouds; stupendous, naked, overhanging cliffs, completely shutting\nout the view; rushing, foaming torrents; absolute desert; the wail of the\nwind sweeping through the clefts of the rocks. Our dependence, our strife\nwith hostile nature, our will broken in the conflict, now appears visibly\nbefore our eyes. Yet, so long as the personal pressure does not gain the\nupper hand, but we continue in \u00e6sthetic contemplation, the pure subject of\nknowing gazes unshaken and unconcerned through that strife of nature,\nthrough that picture of the broken will, and quietly comprehends the Ideas\neven of those objects which are threatening and terrible to the will. In\nthis contrast lies the sense of the sublime.\nBut the impression becomes still stronger, if, when we have before our\neyes, on a large scale, the battle of the raging elements, in such a scene\nwe are prevented from hearing the sound of our own voice by the noise of a\nfalling stream; or, if we are abroad in the storm of tempestuous seas,\nwhere the mountainous waves rise and fall, dash themselves furiously\nagainst steep cliffs, and toss their spray high into the air; the storm\nhowls, the sea boils, the lightning flashes from black clouds, and the\npeals of thunder drown the voice of storm and sea. Then, in the undismayed\nbeholder, the two-fold nature of his consciousness reaches the highest\ndegree of distinctness. He perceives himself, on the one hand, as an\nindividual, as the frail phenomenon of will, which the slightest touch of\nthese forces can utterly destroy, helpless against powerful nature,\ndependent, the victim of chance, a vanishing nothing in the presence of\nstupendous might; and, on the other hand, as the eternal, peaceful,\nknowing subject, the condition of the object, and, therefore, the\nsupporter of this whole world; the terrific strife of nature only his\nidea; the subject itself free and apart from all desires and necessities,\nin the quiet comprehension of the Ideas. This is the complete impression\nof the sublime. Here he obtains a glimpse of a power beyond all comparison\nsuperior to the individual, threatening it with annihilation.\nThe impression of the sublime may be produced in quite another way, by\npresenting a mere immensity in space and time; its immeasurable greatness\ndwindles the individual to nothing. Adhering to Kant\u2019s nomenclature and\nhis accurate division, we may call the first kind the dynamical, and the\nsecond the mathematical sublime, although we entirely dissent from his\nexplanation of the inner nature of the impression, and can allow no share\nin it either to moral reflections, or to hypostases from scholastic\nphilosophy.\nIf we lose ourselves in the contemplation of the infinite greatness of the\nuniverse in space and time, meditate on the thousands of years that are\npast or to come, or if the heavens at night actually bring before our eyes\ninnumerable worlds and so force upon our consciousness the immensity of\nthe universe, we feel ourselves dwindle to nothing; as individuals, as\nliving bodies, as transient phenomena of will, we feel ourselves pass away\nand vanish into nothing like drops in the ocean. But at once there rises\nagainst this ghost of our own nothingness, against such lying\nimpossibility, the immediate consciousness that all these worlds exist\nonly as our idea, only as modifications of the eternal subject of pure\nknowing, which we find ourselves to be as soon as we forget our\nindividuality, and which is the necessary supporter of all worlds and all\ntimes the condition of their possibility. The vastness of the world which\ndisquieted us before, rests now in us; our dependence upon it is annulled\nby its dependence upon us. All this, however, does not come at once into\nreflection, but shows itself merely as the felt consciousness that in some\nsense or other (which philosophy alone can explain) we are one with the\nworld, and therefore not oppressed, but exalted by its immensity. It is\nthe felt consciousness of this that the Upanishads of the Vedas repeatedly\nexpress in such a multitude of different ways; very admirably in the\nsaying already quoted: _H\u00e6 omnes creatur\u00e6 in totum ego sum, et pr\u00e6ter me\naliud ens non est_ (Oupnek\u2019hat, vol. i. p. 122.) It is the transcending of\nour own individuality, the sense of the sublime.\nWe receive this impression of the mathematical-sublime, quite directly, by\nmeans of a space which is small indeed as compared with the world, but\nwhich has become directly perceptible to us, and affects us with its whole\nextent in all its three dimensions, so as to make our own body seem almost\ninfinitely small. An empty space can never be thus perceived, and\ntherefore never an open space, but only space that is directly perceptible\nin all its dimensions by means of the limits which enclose it; thus for\nexample a very high, vast dome, like that of St. Peter\u2019s at Rome, or St.\nPaul\u2019s in London. The sense of the sublime here arises through the\nconsciousness of the vanishing nothingness of our own body in the presence\nof a vastness which, from another point of view, itself exists only in our\nidea, and of which we are as knowing subject, the supporter. Thus here as\neverywhere it arises from the contrast between the insignificance and\ndependence of ourselves as individuals, as phenomena of will, and the\nconsciousness of ourselves as pure subject of knowing. Even the vault of\nthe starry heaven produces this if it is contemplated without reflection;\nbut just in the same way as the vault of stone, and only by its apparent,\nnot its real extent. Some objects of our perception excite in us the\nfeeling of the sublime because, not only on account of their spatial\nvastness, but also of their great age, that is, their temporal duration,\nwe feel ourselves dwarfed to insignificance in their presence, and yet\nrevel in the pleasure of contemplating them: of this kind are very high\nmountains, the Egyptian pyramids, and colossal ruins of great antiquity.\nOur explanation of the sublime applies also to the ethical, to what is\ncalled the sublime character. Such a character arises from this, that the\nwill is not excited by objects which are well calculated to excite it, but\nthat knowledge retains the upper hand in their presence. A man of sublime\ncharacter will accordingly consider men in a purely objective way, and not\nwith reference to the relations which they might have to his will; he\nwill, for example, observe their faults, even their hatred and injustice\nto himself, without being himself excited to hatred; he will behold their\nhappiness without envy; he will recognise their good qualities without\ndesiring any closer relations with them; he will perceive the beauty of\nwomen, but he will not desire them. His personal happiness or unhappiness\nwill not greatly affect him, he will rather be as Hamlet describes\nHoratio:\u2014\n\u201c... for thou hast been,\nAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;\nA man that fortune\u2019s buffets and rewards\nHast ta\u2019en with equal thanks,\u201d &c. (A. 3. Sc. 2.)\nFor in the course of his own life and its misfortunes, he will consider\nless his individual lot than that of humanity in general, and will\ntherefore conduct himself in its regard, rather as knowing than as\nsuffering.\n\u00a7 40. Opposites throw light upon each other, and therefore the remark may\nbe in place here, that the proper opposite of the sublime is something\nwhich would not at the first glance be recognised, as such: _the charming_\nor _attractive_. By this, however, I understand, that which excites the\nwill by presenting to it directly its fulfilment, its satisfaction. We saw\nthat the feeling of the sublime arises from the fact, that something\nentirely unfavourable to the will, becomes the object of pure\ncontemplation, so that such contemplation can only be maintained by\npersistently turning away from the will, and transcending its interests;\nthis constitutes the sublimity of the character. The charming or\nattractive, on the contrary, draws the beholder away from the pure\ncontemplation which is demanded by all apprehension of the beautiful,\nbecause it necessarily excites this will, by objects which directly appeal\nto it, and thus he no longer remains pure subject of knowing, but becomes\nthe needy and dependent subject of will. That every beautiful thing which\nis bright or cheering should be called charming, is the result of a too\ngeneral concept, which arises from a want of accurate discrimination, and\nwhich I must entirely set aside, and indeed condemn. But in the sense of\nthe word which has been given and explained, I find only two species of\nthe charming or attractive in the province of art, and both of them are\nunworthy of it. The one species, a very low one, is found in Dutch\npaintings of still life, when they err by representing articles of food,\nwhich by their deceptive likeness necessarily excite the appetite for the\nthings they represent, and this is just an excitement of the will, which\nputs an end to all \u00e6sthetic contemplation of the object. Painted fruit is\nyet admissible, because we may regard it as the further development of the\nflower, and as a beautiful product of nature in form and colour, without\nbeing obliged to think of it as eatable; but unfortunately we often find,\nrepresented with deceptive naturalness, prepared and served dishes,\noysters, herrings, crabs, bread and butter, beer, wine, and so forth,\nwhich is altogether to be condemned. In historical painting and in\nsculpture the charming consists in naked figures, whose position, drapery,\nand general treatment are calculated to excite the passions of the\nbeholder, and thus pure \u00e6sthetical contemplation is at once annihilated,\nand the aim of art is defeated. This mistake corresponds exactly to that\nwhich we have just censured in the Dutch paintings. The ancients are\nalmost always free from this fault in their representations of beauty and\ncomplete nakedness of form, because the artist himself created them in a\npurely objective spirit, filled with ideal beauty, not in the spirit of\nsubjective, and base sensuality. The charming is thus everywhere to be\navoided in art.\nThere is also a negative species of the charming or exciting which is even\nmore reprehensible than the positive form which has been discussed; this\nis the disgusting or the loathsome. It arouses the will of the beholder,\njust as what is properly speaking charming, and therefore disturbs pure\n\u00e6sthetic contemplation. But it is an active aversion and opposition which\nis excited by it; it arouses the will by presenting to it objects which it\nabhors. Therefore it has always been recognised that it is altogether\ninadmissible in art, where even what is ugly, when it is not disgusting,\nis allowable in its proper place, as we shall see later.\n\u00a7 41. The course of the discussion has made it necessary to insert at this\npoint the treatment of the sublime, though we have only half done with the\nbeautiful, as we have considered its subjective side only. For it was\nmerely a special modification of this subjective side that distinguished\nthe beautiful from the sublime. This difference was found to depend upon\nwhether the state of pure will-less knowing, which is presupposed and\ndemanded by all \u00e6sthetic contemplation, was reached without opposition, by\nthe mere disappearance of the will from consciousness, because the object\ninvited and drew us towards it; or whether it was only attained through\nthe free, conscious transcending of the will, to which the object\ncontemplated had an unfavourable and even hostile relation, which would\ndestroy contemplation altogether, if we were to give ourselves up to it.\nThis is the distinction between the beautiful and the sublime. In the\nobject they are not essentially different, for in every case the object of\n\u00e6sthetical contemplation is not the individual thing, but the Idea in it\nwhich is striving to reveal itself; that is to say, adequate objectivity\nof will at a particular grade. Its necessary correlative, independent,\nlike itself of the principle of sufficient reason, is the pure subject of\nknowing; just as the correlative of the particular thing is the knowing\nindividual, both of which lie within the province of the principle of\nsufficient reason.\nWhen we say that a thing is _beautiful_, we thereby assert that it is an\nobject of our \u00e6sthetic contemplation, and this has a double meaning; on\nthe one hand it means that the sight of the thing makes us _objective_,\nthat is to say, that in contemplating it we are no longer conscious of\nourselves as individuals, but as pure will-less subjects of knowledge; and\non the other hand it means that we recognise in the object, not the\nparticular thing, but an Idea; and this can only happen, so far as our\ncontemplation of it is not subordinated to the principle of sufficient\nreason, does not follow the relation of the object to anything outside it\n(which is always ultimately connected with relations to our own will), but\nrests in the object itself. For the Idea and the pure subject of knowledge\nalways appear at once in consciousness as necessary correlatives, and on\ntheir appearance all distinction of time vanishes, for they are both\nentirely foreign to the principle of sufficient reason in all its forms,\nand lie outside the relations which are imposed by it; they may be\ncompared to the rainbow and the sun, which have no part in the constant\nmovement and succession of the falling drops. Therefore, if, for example,\nI contemplate a tree \u00e6sthetically, _i.e._, with artistic eyes, and thus\nrecognise, not it, but its Idea, it becomes at once of no consequence\nwhether it is this tree or its predecessor which flourished a thousand\nyears ago, and whether the observer is this individual or any other that\nlived anywhere and at any time; the particular thing and the knowing\nindividual are abolished with the principle of sufficient reason, and\nthere remains nothing but the Idea and the pure subject of knowing, which\ntogether constitute the adequate objectivity of will at this grade. And\nthe Idea dispenses not only with time, but also with space, for the Idea\nproper is not this special form which appears before me but its\nexpression, its pure significance, its inner being, which discloses itself\nto me and appeals to me, and which may be quite the same though the\nspatial relations of its form be very different.\nSince, on the one hand, every given thing may be observed in a. purely\nobjective manner and apart from all relations; and since, on the other\nhand, the will manifests itself in everything at some grade of its\nobjectivity, so that everything is the expression of an Idea; it follows\nthat everything is also _beautiful_. That even the most insignificant\nthings admit of pure objective and will-less contemplation, and thus prove\nthat they are beautiful, is shown by what was said above in this reference\nabout the Dutch pictures of still-life (\u00a7 38). But one thing is more\nbeautiful than another, because it makes this pure objective contemplation\neasier, it lends itself to it, and, so to speak, even compels it, and then\nwe call it very beautiful. This is the case sometimes because, as an\nindividual thing, it expresses in its purity the Idea of its species by\nthe very distinct, clearly defined, and significant relation of its parts,\nand also fully reveals that Idea through the completeness of all the\npossible expressions of its species united in it, so that it makes the\ntransition from the individual thing to the Idea, and therefore also the\ncondition of pure contemplation, very easy for the beholder. Sometimes\nthis possession of special beauty in an object lies in the fact that the\nIdea itself which appeals to us in it is a high grade of the objectivity\nof will, and therefore very significant and expressive. Therefore it is\nthat man is more beautiful than all other objects, and the revelation of\nhis nature is the highest aim of art. Human form and expression are the\nmost important objects of plastic art, and human action the most important\nobject of poetry. Yet each thing has its own peculiar beauty, not only\nevery organism which expresses itself in the unity of an individual being,\nbut also everything unorganised and formless, and even every manufactured\narticle. For all these reveal the Ideas through which the will objectifies\nitself at its lowest grades, they give, as it were, the deepest resounding\nbass-notes of nature. Gravity, rigidity, fluidity, light, and so forth,\nare the Ideas which express themselves in rocks, in buildings, in waters.\nLandscape-gardening or architecture can do no more than assist them to\nunfold their qualities distinctly, fully, and variously; they can only\ngive them the opportunity of expressing themselves purely, so that they\nlend themselves to \u00e6sthetic contemplation and make it easier. Inferior\nbuildings or ill-favoured localities, on the contrary, which nature has\nneglected or art has spoiled, perform this task in a very slight degree or\nnot at all; yet even from them these universal, fundamental Ideas of\nnature cannot altogether disappear. To the careful observer they present\nthemselves here also, and even bad buildings and the like are capable of\nbeing \u00e6sthetically considered; the Ideas of the most universal properties\nof their materials are still recognisable in them, only the artificial\nform which has been given them does not assist but hinders \u00e6sthetic\ncontemplation. Manufactured articles also serve to express Ideas, only it\nis not the Idea of the manufactured article which speaks in them, but the\nIdea of the material to which this artificial form has been given. This\nmay be very conveniently expressed in two words, in the language of the\nschoolmen, thus,\u2014the manufactured article expresses the Idea of its _forma\nsubstantialis_, but not that of its _forma accidentalis_; the latter leads\nto no Idea, but only to a human conception of which it is the result. It\nis needless to say that by manufactured article no work of plastic art is\nmeant. The schoolmen understand, in fact, by _forma substantialis_ that\nwhich I call the grade of the objectification of will in a thing. We shall\nreturn immediately, when we treat of architecture, to the Idea of the\nmaterial. Our view, then, cannot be reconciled with that of Plato if he is\nof opinion that a table or a chair express the Idea of a table or a chair\n(De Rep., x., pp. 284, 285, et Parmen., p. 79, ed. Bip.), but we say that\nthey express the Ideas which are already expressed in their mere material\nas such. According to Aristotle (Metap. xi., chap. 3), however, Plato\nhimself only maintained Ideas of natural objects: \u1f41 \u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c6\u03b7, \u1f41\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 (_Plato dixit, quod ide\u00e6 eorum sunt, qu\u00e6 natura sunt_),\nand in chap. 5 he says that, according to the Platonists, there are no\nIdeas of house and ring. In any case, Plato\u2019s earliest disciples, as\nAlcinous informs us (_Introductio __ in Platonicam Philosophiam_, chap.\n9), denied that there were any ideas of manufactured articles. He says:\n\u1f49\u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. \u039f\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2\n\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9, \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2, \u03bf\u1f31\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2\n\u03b7 \u03bb\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, \u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f31\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, \u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf\u1f31\u03bf\u03bd \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u1fbd \u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf\u1f31\u03bf\u03bd\n\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f31\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2; \u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\n\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (_Definiunt autem_\nIDEAM _exemplar \u00e6ternum eorum, qu\u00e6 secundum naturam existunt. Nam plurimis\nex iis, qui Platonem secuti sunt, minime placuit, arte factorum ideas\nesse, ut clypei atque lyr\u00e6; neque rursus eorum, qu\u00e6 pr\u00e6tor naturam, ut\nfebris et choler\u00e6, neque particularium, ceu Socratis et Platonis; neque\netiam rerum vilium, veluti sordium et festuc\u00e6; neque relationum, ut\nmajoris et excedentis: esse namque ideas intellectiones dei \u00e6ternas, ac\nseipsis perfectas_). We may take this opportunity of mentioning another\npoint in which our doctrine of Ideas differs very much from that of Plato.\nHe teaches (De Rep., x., p. 288) that the object which art tries to\nexpress, the ideal of painting and poetry, is not the Idea but the\nparticular thing. Our whole exposition hitherto has maintained exactly the\nopposite, and Plato\u2019s opinion is the less likely to lead us astray,\ninasmuch as it is the source of one of the greatest and best known errors\nof this great man, his depreciation and rejection of art, and especially\npoetry; he directly connects his false judgment in reference to this with\nthe passage quoted.\n\u00a7 42. I return to the exposition of the \u00e6sthetic impression. The knowledge\nof the beautiful always supposes at once and inseparably the pure knowing\nsubject and the known Idea as object. Yet the source of \u00e6sthetic\nsatisfaction will sometimes lie more in the comprehension of the known\nIdea, sometimes more in the blessedness and spiritual peace of the pure\nknowing subject freed from all willing, and therefore from all\nindividuality, and the pain that proceeds from it. And, indeed, this\npredominance of one or the other constituent part of \u00e6sthetic feeling will\ndepend upon whether the intuitively grasped Idea is a higher or a lower\ngrade of the objectivity of will. Thus in \u00e6sthetic contemplation (in the\nreal, or through the medium of art) of the beauty of nature in the\ninorganic and vegetable worlds, or in works of architecture, the pleasure\nof pure will-less knowing will predominate, because the Ideas which are\nhere apprehended are only low grades of the objectivity of will, and are\ntherefore not manifestations of deep significance and rich content. On the\nother hand, if animals and man are the objects of \u00e6sthetic contemplation\nor representation, the pleasure will consist rather in the comprehension\nof these Ideas, which are the most distinct revelation of will; for they\nexhibit the greatest multiplicity of forms, the greatest richness and deep\nsignificance of phenomena, and reveal to us most completely the nature of\nwill, whether in its violence, its terribleness, its satisfaction or its\naberration (the latter in tragic situations), or finally in its change and\nself-surrender, which is the peculiar theme of christian painting; as the\nIdea of the will enlightened by full knowledge is the object of historical\npainting in general, and of the drama. We shall now go through the fine\narts one by one, and this will give completeness and distinctness to the\ntheory of the beautiful which we have advanced.\n\u00a7 43. Matter as such cannot be the expression of an Idea. For, as we found\nin the first book, it is throughout nothing but causality: its being\nconsists in its casual action. But causality is a form of the principle of\nsufficient reason; knowledge of the Idea, on the other hand, absolutely\nexcludes the content of that principle. We also found, in the second book,\nthat matter is the common substratum of all particular phenomena of the\nIdeas, and consequently is the connecting link between the Idea and the\nphenomenon, or the particular thing. Accordingly for both of these reasons\nit is impossible that matter can for itself express any Idea. This is\nconfirmed _a posteriori_ by the fact that it is impossible to have a\nperceptible idea of matter as such, but only an abstract conception; in\nthe former, _i.e._, in perceptible ideas are exhibited only the forms and\nqualities of which matter is the supporter, and in all of which Ideas\nreveal themselves. This corresponds also with the fact, that causality\n(the whole essence of matter) cannot for itself be presented perceptibly,\nbut is merely a definite casual connection. On the other hand, _every\nphenomenon_ of an Idea, because as such it has entered the form of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, or the _principium individuationis_, must\nexhibit itself in matter, as one of its qualities. So far then matter is,\nas we have said, the connecting link between the Idea and the _principium\nindividuationis_, which is the form of knowledge of the individual, or the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Plato is therefore perfectly right in his\nenumeration, for after the Idea and the phenomenon, which include all\nother things in the world, he gives matter only, as a third thing which is\ndifferent from both (Timaus, p. 345). The individual, as a phenomenon of\nthe Idea, is always matter. Every quality of matter is also the phenomenon\nof an Idea, and as such it may always be an object of \u00e6sthetic\ncontemplation, _i.e._, the Idea expressed in it may always be recognised.\nThis holds good of even the most universal qualities of matter, without\nwhich it never appears, and which are the weakest objectivity of will.\nSuch are gravity, cohesion, rigidity, fluidity, sensitiveness to light,\nand so forth.\nIf now we consider _architecture_ simply as a fine art and apart from its\napplication to useful ends, in which it serves the will and not pure\nknowledge, and therefore ceases to be art in our sense; we can assign to\nit no other aim than that of bringing to greater distinctness some of\nthose ideas, which are the lowest grades of the objectivity of will; such\nas gravity, cohesion, rigidity, hardness, those universal qualities of\nstone, those first, simplest, most inarticulate manifestations of will;\nthe bass notes of nature; and after these light, which in many respects is\ntheir opposite. Even at these low grades of the objectivity of will we see\nits nature revealing itself in discord; for properly speaking the conflict\nbetween gravity and rigidity is the sole \u00e6sthetic material of\narchitecture; its problem is to make this conflict appear with perfect\ndistinctness in a multitude of different ways. It solves it by depriving\nthese indestructible forces of the shortest way to their satisfaction, and\nconducting them to it by a circuitous route, so that the conflict is\nlengthened and the inexhaustible efforts of both forces become visible in\nmany different ways. The whole mass of the building, if left to its\noriginal tendency, would exhibit a mere heap or clump, bound as closely as\npossible to the earth, to which gravity, the form in which the will\nappears here, continually presses, while rigidity, also objectivity of\nwill, resists. But this very tendency, this effort, is hindered by\narchitecture from obtaining direct satisfaction, and only allowed to reach\nit indirectly and by roundabout ways. The roof, for example, can only\npress the earth through columns, the arch must support itself, and can\nonly satisfy its tendency towards the earth through the medium of the\npillars, and so forth. But just by these enforced digressions, just by\nthese restrictions, the forces which reside in the crude mass of stone\nunfold themselves in the most distinct and multifarious ways; and the\npurely \u00e6sthetic aim of architecture can go no further than this. Therefore\nthe beauty, at any rate, of a building lies in the obvious adaptation of\nevery part, not to the outward arbitrary end of man (so far the work\nbelongs to practical architecture), but directly to the stability of the\nwhole, to which the position, dimensions, and form of every part must have\nso necessary a relation that, where it is possible, if any one part were\ntaken away, the whole would fall to pieces. For just because each part\nbears just as much as it conveniently can, and each is supported just\nwhere it requires to be and just to the necessary extent, this opposition\nunfolds itself, this conflict between rigidity and gravity, which\nconstitutes the life, the manifestation of will, in the stone, becomes\ncompletely visible, and these lowest grades of the objectivity of will\nreveal themselves distinctly. In the same way the form of each part must\nnot be determined arbitrarily, but by its end, and its relation to the\nwhole. The column is the simplest form of support, determined simply by\nits end: the twisted column is tasteless; the four-cornered pillar is in\nfact not so simple as the round column, though it happens that it is\neasier to make it. The forms also of frieze, rafter, roof, and dome are\nentirely determined by their immediate end, and explain themselves from\nit. The decoration of capitals, &c., belongs to sculpture, not to\narchitecture, which admits it merely as extraneous ornament, and could\ndispense with it. According to what has been said, it is absolutely\nnecessary, in order to understand the \u00e6sthetic satisfaction afforded by a\nwork of architecture, to have immediate knowledge through perception of\nits matter as regards its weight, rigidity, and cohesion, and our pleasure\nin such a work would suddenly be very much diminished by the discovery\nthat the material used was pumice-stone; for then it would appear to us as\na kind of sham building. We would be affected in almost the same way if we\nwere told that it was made of wood, when we had supposed it to be of\nstone, just because this alters and destroys the relation between rigidity\nand gravity, and consequently the significance and necessity of all the\nparts, for these natural forces reveal themselves in a far weaker degree\nin a wooden building. Therefore no real work of architecture as a fine art\ncan be made of wood, although it assumes all forms so easily; this can\nonly be explained by our theory. If we were distinctly told that a\nbuilding, the sight of which gave us pleasure, was made of different kinds\nof material of very unequal weight and consistency, but not\ndistinguishable to the eye, the whole building would become as utterly\nincapable of affording us pleasure as a poem in an unknown language. All\nthis proves that architecture does not affect us mathematically, but also\ndynamically, and that what speaks to us through it, is not mere form and\nsymmetry, but rather those fundamental forces of nature, those first\nIdeas, those lowest grades of the objectivity of will. The regularity of\nthe building and its parts is partly produced by the direct adaptation of\neach member to the stability of the whole, partly it serves to facilitate\nthe survey and comprehension of the whole, and finally, regular figures to\nsome extent enhance the beauty because they reveal the constitution of\nspace as such. But all this is of subordinate value and necessity, and by\nno means the chief concern; indeed, symmetry is not invariably demanded,\nas ruins are still beautiful.\nWorks of architecture have further quite a special relation to light; they\ngain a double beauty in the full sunshine, with the blue sky as a\nbackground, and again they have quite a different effect by moonlight.\nTherefore, when a beautiful work of architecture is to be erected, special\nattention is always paid to the effects of the light and to the climate.\nThe reason of all this is, indeed, principally that all the parts and\ntheir relations are only made clearly visible by a bright, strong light;\nbut besides this I am of opinion that it is the function of architecture\nto reveal the nature of light just as it reveals that of things so\nopposite to it as gravity and rigidity. For the light is intercepted,\nconfined, and reflected by the great opaque, sharply outlined, and\nvariously formed masses of stone, and thus it unfolds its nature and\nqualities in the purest and clearest way, to the great pleasure of the\nbeholders, for light is the most joy-giving of things, as the condition\nand the objective correlative of the most perfect kind of knowledge of\nperception.\nNow, because the Ideas which architecture brings to clear perception, are\nthe lowest grades of the objectivity of will, and consequently their\nobjective significance, which architecture reveals to us, is comparatively\nsmall; the \u00e6sthetic pleasure of looking at a beautiful building in a good\nlight will lie, not so much in the comprehension of the Idea, as in the\nsubjective correlative which accompanies this comprehension; it will\nconsist pre-eminently in the fact that the beholder, set free from the\nkind of knowledge that belongs to the individual, and which serves the\nwill and follows the principle of sufficient reason, is raised to that of\nthe pure subject of knowing free from will. It will consist then\nprincipally in pure contemplation itself, free from all the suffering of\nwill and of individuality. In this respect the opposite of architecture,\nand the other extreme of the series of the fine arts, is the drama, which\nbrings to knowledge the most significant Ideas. Therefore in the \u00e6sthetic\npleasure afforded by the drama the objective side is throughout\npredominant.\nArchitecture has this distinction from plastic art and poetry: it does not\ngive us a copy but the thing itself. It does not repeat, as they do, the\nknown Idea, so that the artist lends his eyes to the beholder, but in it\nthe artist merely presents the object to the beholder, and facilitates for\nhim the comprehension of the Idea by bringing the actual, individual\nobject to a distinct and complete expression of its nature.\nUnlike the works of the other arts, those of architecture are very seldom\nexecuted for purely \u00e6sthetic ends. These are generally subordinated to\nother useful ends which are foreign to art itself. Thus the great merit of\nthe architect consists in achieving and attaining the pure \u00e6sthetic ends,\nin spite of their subordination to other ends which are foreign to them.\nThis he does by cleverly adapting them in a variety of ways to the\narbitrary ends in view, and by rightly judging which form of \u00e6sthetical\narchitectonic beauty is compatible and may be associated with a temple,\nwhich with a palace, which with a prison, and so forth. The more a harsh\nclimate increases these demands of necessity and utility, determines them\ndefinitely, and prescribes them more inevitably, the less free play has\nbeauty in architecture. In the mild climate of India, Egypt, Greece, and\nRome, where the demands of necessity were fewer and less definite,\narchitecture could follow its \u00e6sthetic ends with the greatest freedom. But\nunder a northern sky this was sorely hindered. Here, when caissons,\npointed roofs and towers were what was demanded, architecture could only\nunfold its own beauty within very narrow limits, and therefore it was\nobliged to make amends by resorting all the more to the borrowed ornaments\nof sculpture, as is seen in Gothic architecture.\nWe thus see that architecture is greatly restricted by the demands of\nnecessity and utility; but on the other hand it has in them a very\npowerful support, for, on account of the magnitude and costliness of its\nworks, and the narrow sphere of its \u00e6sthetic effect, it could not continue\nto exist merely as a fine art, if it had not also, as a useful and\nnecessary profession, a firm and honourable place among the occupations of\nmen. It is the want of this that prevents another art from taking its\nplace beside architecture as a sister art, although in an \u00e6sthetical point\nof view it is quite properly to be classed along with it as its\ncounterpart; I mean artistic arrangements of water. For what architecture\naccomplishes for the Idea of gravity when it appears in connection with\nthat of rigidity, hydraulics accomplishes for the same Idea, when it is\nconnected with fluidity, _i.e._, formlessness, the greatest mobility and\ntransparency. Leaping waterfalls foaming and tumbling over rocks,\ncataracts dispersed into floating spray, springs gushing up as high\ncolumns of water, and clear reflecting lakes, reveal the Ideas of fluid\nand heavy matter, in precisely the same way as the works of architecture\nunfold the Ideas of rigid matter. Artistic hydraulics, however, obtains no\nsupport from practical hydraulics, for, as a rule, their ends cannot be\ncombined; yet, in exceptional cases, this happens; for example, in the\nCascata di Trevi at Rome.(52)\n\u00a7 44. What the two arts we have spoken of accomplish for these lowest\ngrades of the objectivity of will, is performed for the higher grades of\nvegetable nature by artistic horticulture. The landscape beauty of a scene\nconsists, for the most part, in the multiplicity of natural objects which\nare present in it, and then in the fact that they are clearly separated,\nappear distinctly, and yet exhibit a fitting connection and alternation.\nThese two conditions are assisted and promoted by landscape-gardening, but\nit has by no means such a mastery over its material as architecture, and\ntherefore its effect is limited. The beauty with which it is concerned\nbelongs almost exclusively to nature; it has done little for it; and, on\nthe other hand, it can do little against unfavourable nature, and when\nnature works, not for it, but against it, its achievements are small.\nThe vegetable world offers itself everywhere for \u00e6sthetic enjoyment\nwithout the medium of art; but so far as it is an object of art, it\nbelongs principally to landscape-painting; to the province of which all\nthe rest of unconscious nature also belongs. In paintings of still life,\nand of mere architecture, ruins, interiors of churches, &c., the\nsubjective side of \u00e6sthetic pleasure is predominant, _i.e._, our\nsatisfaction does not lie principally in the direct comprehension of the\nrepresented Ideas, but rather in the subjective correlative of this\ncomprehension, pure, will-less knowing. For, because the painter lets us\nsee these things through his eyes, we at once receive a sympathetic and\nreflected sense of the deep spiritual peace and absolute silence of the\nwill, which were necessary in order to enter with knowledge so entirely\ninto these lifeless objects, and comprehend them with such love, _i.e._,\nin this case with such a degree of objectivity. The effect of\nlandscape-painting proper is indeed, as a whole, of this kind; but because\nthe Ideas expressed are more distinct and significant, as higher grades of\nthe objectivity of will, the objective side of \u00e6sthetic pleasure already\ncomes more to the front and assumes as much importance as the subjective\nside. Pure knowing as such is no longer the paramount consideration, for\nwe are equally affected by the known Platonic Idea, the world as idea at\nan important grade of the objectification of will.\nBut a far higher grade is revealed by animal painting and sculpture. Of\nthe latter we have some important antique remains; for example, horses at\nVenice, on Monte Cavallo, and on the Elgin Marbles, also at Florence in\nbronze and marble; the ancient boar, howling wolves, the lions in the\narsenal at Venice, also in the Vatican a whole room almost filled with\nancient animals, &c. In these representations the objective side of\n\u00e6sthetic pleasure obtains a marked predominance over the subjective. The\npeace of the subject which knows these Ideas, which has silenced its own\nwill, is indeed present, as it is in all \u00e6sthetic contemplation; but its\neffect is not felt, for we are occupied with the restlessness and\nimpetuosity of the will represented. It is that very will, which\nconstitutes our own nature, that here appears to us in forms, in which its\nmanifestation is not, as in us, controlled and tempered by intellect, but\nexhibits itself in stronger traits, and with a distinctness that borders\non the grotesque and monstrous. For this very reason there is no\nconcealment; it is free, na\u00efve, open as the day, and this is the cause of\nour interest in animals. The characteristics of species appeared already\nin the representation of plants, but showed itself only in the forms; here\nit becomes much more distinct, and expresses itself not only in the form,\nbut in the action, position, and mien, yet always merely as the character\nof the species, not of the individual. This knowledge of the Ideas of\nhigher grades, which in painting we receive through extraneous means, we\nmay gain directly by the pure contemplative perception of plants, and\nobservation of beasts, and indeed of the latter in their free, natural,\nand unrestrained state. The objective contemplation of their manifold and\nmarvellous forms, and of their actions and behaviour, is an instructive\nlesson from the great book of nature, it is a deciphering of the true\n_signatura rerum_.(53) We see in them the manifold grades and modes of the\nmanifestation of will, which in all beings of one and the same grade,\nwills always in the same way, which objectifies itself as life, as\nexistence in such endless variety, and such different forms, which are all\nadaptations to the different external circumstances, and may be compared\nto many variations on the same theme. But if we had to communicate to the\nobserver, for reflection, and in a word, the explanation of their inner\nnature, it would be best to make use of that Sanscrit formula which occurs\nso often in the sacred books of the Hindoos, and is called Mahavakya,\ni.e., the great word: \u201c_Tat twam asi_,\u201d which means, \u201cthis living thing\nart thou.\u201d\n\u00a7 45. The great problem of historical painting and sculpture is to express\ndirectly and for perception the Idea in which the will reaches the highest\ngrade of its objectification. The objective side of the pleasure afforded\nby the beautiful is here always predominant, and the subjective side has\nretired into the background. It is further to be observed that at the next\ngrade below this, animal painting, the characteristic is entirely one with\nthe beautiful; the most characteristic lion, wolf, horse, sheep, or ox,\nwas always the most beautiful also. The reason of this is that animals\nhave only the character of their species, no individual character. In the\nrepresentation of men the character of the species is separated from that\nof the individual; the former is now called beauty (entirely in the\nobjective sense), but the latter retains the name, character, or\nexpression, and the new difficulty arises of representing both, at once\nand completely, in the same individual.\n_Human beauty_ is an objective expression, which means the fullest\nobjectification of will at the highest grade at which it is knowable, the\nIdea of man in general, completely expressed in the sensible form. But\nhowever much the objective side of the beautiful appears here, the\nsubjective side still always accompanies it. And just because no object\ntransports us so quickly into pure \u00e6sthetic contemplation, as the most\nbeautiful human countenance and form, at the sight of which we are\ninstantly filled with unspeakable satisfaction, and raised above ourselves\nand all that troubles us; this is only possible because this most distinct\nand purest knowledge of will raises us most easily and quickly to the\nstate of pure knowing, in which our personality, our will with its\nconstant pain, disappears, so long as the pure \u00e6sthetic pleasure lasts.\nTherefore it is that Goethe says: \u201cNo evil can touch him who looks on\nhuman beauty; he feels himself at one with himself and with the world.\u201d\nThat a beautiful human form is produced by nature must be explained in\nthis way. At this its highest grade the will objectifies itself in an\nindividual; and therefore through circumstances and its own power it\ncompletely overcomes all the hindrances and opposition which the phenomena\nof the lower grades present to it. Such are the forces of nature, from\nwhich the will must always first extort and win back the matter that\nbelongs to all its manifestations. Further, the phenomenon of will at its\nhigher grades always has multiplicity in its form. Even the tree is only a\nsystematic aggregate of innumerably repeated sprouting fibres. This\ncombination assumes greater complexity in higher forms, and the human body\nis an exceedingly complex system of different parts, each of which has a\npeculiar life of its own, _vita propria_, subordinate to the whole. Now\nthat all these parts are in the proper fashion subordinate to the whole,\nand co-ordinate to each other, that they all work together harmoniously\nfor the expression of the whole, nothing superfluous, nothing restricted;\nall these are the rare conditions, whose result is beauty, the completely\nexpressed character of the species. So is it in nature. But how in art?\nOne would suppose that art achieved the beautiful by imitating nature. But\nhow is the artist to recognise the perfect work which is to be imitated,\nand distinguish it from the failures, if he does not anticipate the\nbeautiful _before experience_? And besides this, has nature ever produced\na human being perfectly beautiful in all his parts? It has accordingly\nbeen thought that the artist must seek out the beautiful parts,\ndistributed among a number of different human beings, and out of them\nconstruct a beautiful whole; a perverse and foolish opinion. For it will\nbe asked, how is he to know that just these forms and not others are\nbeautiful? We also see what kind of success attended the efforts of the\nold German painters to achieve the beautiful by imitating nature. Observe\ntheir naked figures. No knowledge of the beautiful is possible purely _a\nposteriori_, and from mere experience; it is always, at least in part, _a\npriori_, although quite different in kind, from the forms of the principle\nof sufficient reason, of which we are conscious _a priori_. These concern\nthe universal form of phenomena as such, as it constitutes the possibility\nof knowledge in general, the universal _how_ of all phenomena, and from\nthis knowledge proceed mathematics and pure natural science. But this\nother kind of knowledge _a priori_, which makes it possible to express the\nbeautiful, concerns, not the form but the content of phenomena, not the\n_how_ but the _what_ of the phenomenon. That we all recognise human beauty\nwhen we see it, but that in the true artist this takes place with such\nclearness that he shows it as he has never seen it, and surpasses nature\nin his representation; this is only possible because _we ourselves are_\nthe will whose adequate objectification at its highest grade is here to be\njudged and discovered. Thus alone have we in fact an anticipation of that\nwhich nature (which is just the will that constitutes our own being)\nstrives to express. And in the true genius this anticipation is\naccompanied by so great a degree of intelligence that he recognises the\nIdea in the particular thing, and thus, as it were, _understands the\nhalf-uttered speech of nature_, and articulates clearly what she only\nstammered forth. He expresses in the hard marble that beauty of form which\nin a thousand attempts she failed to produce, he presents it to nature,\nsaying, as it were, to her, \u201cThat is what you wanted to say!\u201d And whoever\nis able to judge replies, \u201cYes, that is it.\u201d Only in this way was it\npossible for the genius of the Greeks to find the type of human beauty and\nestablish it as a canon for the school of sculpture; and only by virtue of\nsuch an anticipation is it possible for all of us to recognise beauty,\nwhen it has actually been achieved by nature in the particular case. This\nanticipation is the _Ideal_. It is the _Idea_ so far as it is known _a\npriori_, at least half, and it becomes practical for art, because it\ncorresponds to and completes what is given _a posteriori_ through nature.\nThe possibility of such an anticipation of the beautiful _a priori_ in the\nartist, and of its recognition _a posteriori_ by the critic, lies in the\nfact that the artist and the critic are themselves the \u201cin-itself\u201d of\nnature, the will which objectifies itself. For, as Empedocles said, like\ncan only be known by like: only nature can understand itself: only nature\ncan fathom itself: but only spirit also can understand spirit.(54)\nThe opinion, which is absurd, although expressed by the Socrates of\nXenophon (Stob\u00e6i Floril, vol. ii. p. 384) that the Greeks discovered the\nestablished ideal of human beauty empirically, by collecting particular\nbeautiful parts, uncovering and noting here a knee, there an arm, has an\nexact parallel in the art of poetry. The view is entertained, that\nShakespeare, for example, observed, and then gave forth from his own\nexperience of life, the innumerable variety of the characters in his\ndramas, so true, so sustained, so profoundly worked out. The impossibility\nand absurdity of such an assumption need not be dwelt upon. It is obvious\nthat the man of genius produces the works of poetic art by means of an\nanticipation of what is characteristic, just as he produces the works of\nplastic and pictorial art by means of a prophetic anticipation of the\nbeautiful; yet both require experience as a pattern or model, for thus\nalone can that which is dimly known _a priori_ be called into clear\nconsciousness, and an intelligent representation of it becomes possible.\nHuman beauty was explained above as the fullest objectification of will at\nthe highest grade at which it is knowable. It expresses itself through the\nform; and this lies in space alone, and has no necessary connection with\ntime, as, for example, motion has. Thus far then we may say: the adequate\nobjectification of will through a merely spatial phenomenon is beauty, in\nthe objective sense. A plant is nothing but such a merely spatial\nphenomenon of will; for no motion, and consequently no relation to time\n(regarded apart from its development), belongs to the expression of its\nnature; its mere form expresses its whole being and displays it openly.\nBut brutes and men require, further, for the full revelation of the will\nwhich is manifested in them, a series of actions, and thus the\nmanifestation in them takes on a direct relation to time. All this has\nalready been explained in the preceding book; it is related to what we are\nconsidering at present in the following way. As the merely spatial\nmanifestation of will can objectify it fully or defectively at each\ndefinite grade,\u2014and it is this which constitutes beauty or ugliness,\u2014so\nthe temporal objectification of will, _i.e._, the action, and indeed the\ndirect action, the movement, may correspond to the will, which objectifies\nitself in it, purely and fully without foreign admixture, without\nsuperfluity, without defect, only expressing exactly the act of will\ndetermined in each case;\u2014or the converse of all this may occur. In the\nfirst case the movement is made with _grace_, in the second case without\nit. Thus as beauty is the adequate representation of will generally,\nthrough its merely spatial manifestation; _grace_ is the adequate\nrepresentation of will through its temporal manifestation, that is to say,\nthe perfectly accurate and fitting expression of each act of will, through\nthe movement and position which objectify it. Since movement and position\npresuppose the body, Winckelmann\u2019s expression is very true and suitable,\nwhen he says, \u201cGrace is the proper relation of the acting person to the\naction\u201d (Works, vol. i. p. 258). It is thus evident that beauty may be\nattributed to a plant, but no grace, unless in a figurative sense; but to\nbrutes and men, both beauty and grace. Grace consists, according to what\nhas been said, in every movement being performed, and every position\nassumed, in the easiest, most appropriate and convenient way, and\ntherefore being the pure, adequate expression of its intention, or of the\nact of will, without any superfluity, which exhibits itself as aimless,\nmeaningless bustle, or as wooden stiffness. Grace presupposes as its\ncondition a true proportion of all the limbs, and a symmetrical,\nharmonious figure; for complete ease and evident appropriateness of all\npositions and movements are only possible by means of these. Grace is\ntherefore never without a certain degree of beauty of person. The two,\ncomplete and united, are the most distinct manifestation of will at the\nhighest grade of its objectification.\nIt was mentioned above that in order rightly to portray man, it is\nnecessary to separate the character of the species from that of the\nindividual, so that to a certain extent every man expresses an Idea\npeculiar to himself, as was said in the last book. Therefore the arts\nwhose aim is the representation of the Idea of man, have as their problem,\nnot only beauty, the character of the species, but also the character of\nthe individual, which is called, _par excellence_, _character_. But this\nis only the case in so far as this character is to be regarded, not as\nsomething accidental and quite peculiar to the man as a single individual,\nbut as a side of the Idea of humanity which is specially apparent in this\nindividual, and the representation of which is therefore of assistance in\nrevealing this Idea. Thus the character, although as such it is\nindividual, must yet be Ideal, that is, its significance in relation to\nthe Idea of humanity generally (the objectifying of which it assists in\nits own way) must be comprehended and expressed with special prominence.\nApart from this the representation is a portrait, a copy of the individual\nas such, with all his accidental qualities. And even the portrait ought to\nbe, as Winckelmann says, the ideal of the individual.\nThat _character_ which is to be ideally comprehended, as the prominence of\na special side of the Idea of humanity, expresses itself visibly, partly\nthrough permanent physiognomy and bodily form, partly through passing\nemotion and passion, the reciprocal modification of knowing and willing by\neach other, which is all exhibited in the mien and movements. Since the\nindividual always belongs to humanity, and, on the other hand, humanity\nalways reveals itself in the individual with what is indeed peculiar ideal\nsignificance, beauty must not be destroyed by character nor character by\nbeauty. For if the character of the species is annulled by that of the\nindividual, the result is caricature; and if the character of the\nindividual is annulled by that of the species, the result is an absence of\nmeaning. Therefore the representation which aims at beauty, as sculpture\nprincipally does, will yet always modify this (the character of the\nspecies), in some respect, by the individual character, and will always\nexpress the Idea of man in a definite individual manner, giving prominence\nto a special side of it. For the human individual as such has to a certain\nextent the dignity of a special Idea, and it is essential to the Idea of\nman that it should express itself in individuals of special significance.\nTherefore we find in the works of the ancients, that the beauty distinctly\ncomprehended by them, is not expressed in one form, but in many forms of\ndifferent character. It is always apprehended, as it were, from a\ndifferent side, and expressed in one way in Apollo, in another way in\nBacchus, in another in Hercules, in another in Antinous; indeed the\ncharacteristic may limit the beautiful, and finally extend even to\nhideousness, in the drunken Silenus, in the Faun, &c. If the\ncharacteristic goes so far as actually to annul the character of the\nspecies, if it extends to the unnatural, it becomes caricature. But we can\nfar less afford to allow grace to be interfered with by what is\ncharacteristic than even beauty, for graceful position and movement are\ndemanded for the expression of the character also; but yet it must be\nachieved in the way which is most fitting, appropriate, and easy for the\nperson. This will be observed, not only by the sculptor and the painter,\nbut also by every good actor; otherwise caricature will appear here also\nas grimace or distortion.\nIn sculpture, beauty and grace are the principal concern. The special\ncharacter of the mind, appearing in emotion, passion, alternations of\nknowing and willing, which can only be represented by the expression of\nthe countenance and the gestures, is the peculiar sphere of _painting_.\nFor although eyes and colour, which lie outside the province of sculpture,\ncontribute much to beauty, they are yet far more essential to character.\nFurther, beauty unfolds itself more completely when it is contemplated\nfrom various points of view; but the expression, the character, can only\nbe completely comprehended from _one_ point of view.\nBecause beauty is obviously the chief aim of sculpture, Lessing tried to\nexplain the fact that the _Laocoon does not cry out_, by saying that\ncrying out is incompatible with beauty. The Laocoon formed for Lessing the\ntheme, or at least the text of a work of his own, and both before and\nafter him a great deal has been written on the subject. I may therefore be\nallowed to express my views about it in passing, although so special a\ndiscussion does not properly belong to the scheme of this work, which is\nthroughout concerned with what is general.\n\u00a7 46. That Laocoon, in the celebrated group, does not cry out is obvious,\nand the universal and ever-renewed surprise at this must be occasioned by\nthe fact that any of us would cry out if we were in his place. And nature\ndemands that it should be so; for in the case of the acutest physical\npain, and the sudden seizure by the greatest bodily fear, all reflection,\nthat might have inculcated silent endurance, is entirely expelled from\nconsciousness, and nature relieves itself by crying out, thus expressing\nboth the pain and the fear, summoning the deliverer and terrifying the\nassailer. Thus Winckelmann missed the expression of crying out; but as he\nwished to justify the artist he turned Laocoon into a Stoic, who\nconsidered it beneath his dignity to cry out _secundum naturam_, but added\nto his pain the useless constraint of suppressing all utterance of it.\nWinckelmann therefore sees in him \u201cthe tried spirit of a great man, who\nwrithes in agony, and yet seeks to suppress the utterance of his feeling,\nand to lock it up in himself. He does not break forth into loud cries, as\nin Virgil, but only anxious sighs escape him,\u201d &c. (Works, vol. vii. p.\n98, and at greater length in vol. vi. p. 104). Now Lessing criticised this\nopinion of Winckelmann\u2019s in his Laocoon, and improved it in the way\nmentioned above. In place of the psychological he gave the purely \u00e6sthetic\nreason that beauty, the principle of ancient art, does not admit of the\nexpression of crying out. Another argument which he added to this, that a\nmerely passing state incapable of duration ought not to be represented in\nmotionless works of art, has a hundred examples of most excellent figures\nagainst it, which are fixed in merely transitory movements, dancing,\nwrestling, catching, &c. Indeed Goethe, in the essay on the Laocoon, which\nopens the Propylaen (p. 8), holds that the choice of such a merely\nfleeting movement is absolutely necessary. In our own day Hirt (Horen,\n1797, tenth St.) finally decided the point, deducing everything from the\nhighest truth of expression, that Laocoon does not cry out, because he can\nno longer do so, as he is at the point of death from choking. Lastly,\nFernow (\u201cR\u00f6mische Studien,\u201d vol. i. p. 246) expounded and weighed all\nthese opinions; he added, however, no new one of his own, but combined\nthese three eclectically.\nI cannot but wonder that such thoughtful and acute men should laboriously\nbring far-fetched and insufficient reasons, should resort to psychological\nand physiological arguments, to explain a matter the reason of which lies\nso near at hand, and is obvious at once to the unprejudiced; and\nespecially I wonder that Lessing, who came so near the true explanation,\nshould yet have entirely missed the real point.\nBefore all psychological and physiological inquiries as to whether Laocoon\nwould cry out in his position or not (and I certainly affirm that he\nwould), it must be decided as regards the group in question, that crying\nout ought not to be expressed in it, for the simple reason that its\nexpression lies quite outside the province of sculpture. A shrieking\nLaocoon could not be produced in marble, but only a figure with the mouth\nopen vainly endeavouring to shriek; a Laocoon whose voice has stuck in his\nthroat, _vox faucibus haesit_. The essence of shrieking, and consequently\nits effect upon the onlooker, lies entirely in sound; not in the\ndistortion of the mouth. This phenomenon, which necessarily accompanies\nshrieking, derives motive and justification only from the sound produced\nby means of it; then it is permissible and indeed necessary, as\ncharacteristic of the action, even though it interferes with beauty. But\nin plastic art, to which the representation of shrieking is quite foreign\nand impossible, it would be actual folly to represent the medium of\nviolent shrieking, the distorted mouth, which would disturb all the\nfeatures and the remainder of the expression; for thus at the sacrifice of\nmany other things the means would be represented, while its end, the\nshrieking itself, and its effect upon our feelings, would be left out. Nay\nmore, there would be produced the spectacle of a continuous effort without\neffect, which is always ridiculous, and may really be compared to what\nhappened when some one for a joke stopped the horn of a night watchman\nwith wax while he was asleep, and then awoke him with the cry of fire, and\namused himself by watching his vain endeavours to blow the horn. When, on\nthe other hand, the expression of shrieking lies in the province of poetic\nor histrionic art, it is quite admissible, because it helps to express the\ntruth, _i.e._, the complete expression of the Idea. Thus it is with\npoetry, which claims the assistance of the imagination of the reader, in\norder to enable it to represent things perceptibly. Therefore Virgil makes\nLaocoon cry out like the bellowing of an ox that has broken loose after\nbeing struck by the axe; and Homer (Il. xx. 48-53) makes Mars and Minerva\nshriek horribly, without derogating from their divine dignity or beauty.\nThe same with acting; Laocoon on the stage would certainly have to shriek.\nSophocles makes Philoctetus cry out, and, on the ancient stage at any\nrate, he must actually have done so. As a case in point, I remember having\nseen in London the great actor Kemble play in a piece called Pizarro,\ntranslated from the German. He took the part of the American, a\nhalf-savage, but of very noble character. When he was wounded he cried out\nloudly and wildly, which had a great and admirable effect, for it was\nexceedingly characteristic and therefore assisted the truth of the\nrepresentation very much. On the other hand, a painted or sculptured model\nof a man shrieking, would be much more absurd than the painted music which\nis censured in Goethe\u2019s Propylaen. For shrieking does far more injury to\nthe expression and beauty of the whole than music, which at the most only\noccupies the hands and arms, and is to be looked upon as an occupation\ncharacteristic of the person; indeed thus far it may quite rightly be\npainted, as long as it demands no violent movement of the body, or\ndistortion of the mouth: for example, St. Cecilia at the organ, Raphael\u2019s\nviolin-player in the Sciarra Gallery at Rome, and others. Since then, on\naccount of the limits of the art, the pain of Laocoon must not be\nexpressed by shrieking, the artist was obliged to employ every other\nexpression of pain; this he has done in the most perfect manner, as is\nably described by Winckelmann (Works, vol. vi. p. 104), whose admirable\naccount thus retains its full value and truth, as soon as we abstract from\nthe stoical view which underlies it.(55)\n\u00a7 47. Because beauty accompanied with grace is the principal object of\nsculpture, it loves nakedness, and allows clothing only so far as it does\nnot conceal the form. It makes use of drapery, not as a covering, but as a\nmeans of exhibiting the form, a method of exposition that gives much\nexercise to the understanding, for it can only arrive at a perception of\nthe cause, the form of the body, through the only directly given effect,\nthe drapery. Thus to a certain extent drapery is in sculpture what\nfore-shortening is in painting. Both are suggestions, yet not symbolical,\nbut such that, if they are successful, they force the understanding\ndirectly to perceive what is suggested, just as if it were actually given.\nI may be allowed, in passing, to insert here a comparison that is very\npertinent to the arts we are discussing. It is this: as the beautiful\nbodily form is seen to the greatest advantage when clothed in the lightest\nway, or indeed without any clothing at all, and therefore a very handsome\nman, if he had also taste and the courage to follow it, would go about\nalmost naked, clothed only after the manner of the ancients; so every one\nwho possesses a beautiful and rich mind will always express himself in the\nmost natural, direct, and simple way, concerned, if it be possible, to\ncommunicate his thoughts to others, and thus relieve the loneliness that\nhe must feel in such a world as this. And conversely, poverty of mind,\nconfusion, and perversity of thought, will clothe itself in the most\nfar-fetched expressions and the obscurest forms of speech, in order to\nwrap up in difficult and pompous phraseology small, trifling, insipid, or\ncommonplace thoughts; like a man who has lost the majesty of beauty, and\ntrying to make up for the deficiency by means of clothing, seeks to hide\nthe insignificance or ugliness of his person under barbaric finery,\ntinsel, feathers, ruffles, cuffs, and mantles. Many an author, if\ncompelled to translate his pompous and obscure book into its little clear\ncontent, would be as utterly spoilt as this man if he had to go naked.\n\u00a7 48. _Historical painting_ has for its principal object, besides beauty\nand grace, character. By character we mean generally, the representation\nof will at the highest grade of its objectification, when the individual,\nas giving prominence to a particular side of the Idea of humanity, has\nspecial significance, and shows this not merely by his form, but makes it\nvisible in his bearing and occupation, by action of every kind, and the\nmodifications of knowing and willing that occasion and accompany it. The\nIdea of man must be exhibited in these circumstances, and therefore the\nunfolding of its many-sidedness must be brought before our eyes by means\nof representative individuals, and these individuals can only be made\nvisible in their significance through various scenes, events, and actions.\nThis is the endless problem of the historical painter, and he solves it by\nplacing before us scenes of life of every kind, of greater or less\nsignificance. No individual and no action can be without significance; in\nall and through all the Idea of man unfolds itself more and more.\nTherefore no event of human life is excluded from the sphere of painting.\nIt is thus a great injustice to the excellent painters of the Dutch\nschool, to prize merely their technical skill, and to look down upon them\nin other respects, because, for the most part, they represent objects of\ncommon life, whereas it is assumed that only the events of the history of\nthe world, or the incidents of biblical story, have significance. We ought\nfirst to bethink ourselves that the inward significance of an action is\nquite different from its outward significance, and that these are often\nseparated from each other. The outward significance is the importance of\nan action in relation to its result for and in the actual world; thus\naccording to the principle of sufficient reason. The inward significance\nis the depth of the insight into the Idea of man which it reveals, in that\nit brings to light sides of that Idea which rarely appear, by making\nindividuals who assert themselves distinctly and decidedly, disclose their\npeculiar characteristics by means of appropriately arranged circumstances.\nOnly the inward significance concerns art; the outward belongs to history.\nThey are both completely independent of each other; they may appear\ntogether, but may each appear alone. An action which is of the highest\nsignificance for history may in inward significance be a very ordinary and\ncommon one; and conversely, a scene of ordinary daily life may be of great\ninward significance, if human individuals, and the inmost recesses of\nhuman action and will, appear in it in a clear and distinct light.\nFurther, the outward and the inward significance of a scene may be equal\nand yet very different. Thus, for example, it is all the same, as far as\ninward significance is concerned, whether ministers discuss the fate of\ncountries and nations over a map, or boors wrangle in a beer-house over\ncards and dice, just as it is all the same whether we play chess with\ngolden or wooden pieces. But apart from this, the scenes and events that\nmake up the life of so many millions of men, their actions, their sorrows,\ntheir joys, are on that account important enough to be the object of art,\nand by their rich variety they must afford material enough for unfolding\nthe many-sided Idea of man. Indeed the very transitoriness of the moment\nwhich art has fixed in such a picture (now called _genre_-painting)\nexcites a slight and peculiar sensation; for to fix the fleeting,\never-changing world in the enduring picture of a single event, which yet\nrepresents the whole, is an achievement of the art of painting by which it\nseems to bring time itself to a standstill, for it raises the individual\nto the Idea of its species. Finally, the historical and outwardly\nsignificant subjects of painting have often the disadvantage that just\nwhat is significant in them cannot be presented to perception, but must be\narrived at by thought. In this respect the nominal significance of the\npicture must be distinguished from its real significance. The former is\nthe outward significance, which, however, can only be reached as a\nconception; the latter is that side of the Idea of man which is made\nvisible to the onlooker in the picture. For example, Moses found by the\nEgyptian princess is the nominal significance of a painting; it represents\na moment of the greatest importance in history; the real significance, on\nthe other hand, that which is really given to the onlooker, is a foundling\nchild rescued from its floating cradle by a great lady, an incident which\nmay have happened more than once. The costume alone can here indicate the\nparticular historical case to the learned; but the costume is only of\nimportance to the nominal significance, and is a matter of indifference to\nthe real significance; for the latter knows only the human being as such,\nnot the arbitrary forms. Subjects taken from history have no advantage\nover those which are taken from mere possibility, and which are therefore\nto be called, not individual, but merely general. For what is peculiarly\nsignificant in the former is not the individual, not the particular event\nas such, but the universal in it, the side of the Idea of humanity which\nexpresses itself through it. But, on the other hand, definite historical\nsubjects are not on this account to be rejected, only the really artistic\nview of such subjects, both in the painter and in the beholder, is never\ndirected to the individual particulars in them, which properly constitute\nthe historical, but to the universal which expresses itself in them, to\nthe Idea. And only those historical subjects are to be chosen the chief\npoint of which can actually be represented, and not merely arrived at by\nthought, otherwise the nominal significance is too remote from the real;\nwhat is merely thought in connection with the picture becomes of most\nimportance, and interferes with what is perceived. If even on the stage it\nis not right that the chief incident of the plot should take place behind\nthe scenes (as in French tragedies), it is clearly a far greater fault in\na picture. Historical subjects are distinctly disadvantageous only when\nthey confine the painter to a field which has not been chosen for artistic\nbut for other reasons, and especially when this field is poor in\npicturesque and significant objects\u2014if, for example, it is the history of\na small, isolated, capricious, hierarchical (_i.e._, ruled by error),\nobscure people, like the Jews, despised by the great contemporary nations\nof the East and the West. Since the wandering of the tribes lies between\nus and all ancient nations, as the change of the bed of the ocean lies\nbetween the earth\u2019s surface as it is to-day and as it was when those\norganisations existed which we only know from fossil remains, it is to be\nregarded generally as a great misfortune that the people whose culture was\nto be the principal basis of our own were not the Indians or the Greeks,\nor even the Romans, but these very Jews. But it was especially a great\nmisfortune for the Italian painters of genius in the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries that, in the narrow sphere to which they were\narbitrarily driven for the choice of subjects, they were obliged to have\nrecourse to miserable beings of every kind. For the New Testament, as\nregards its historical part, is almost more unsuitable for painting than\nthe Old, and the subsequent history of martyrs and doctors of the church\nis a very unfortunate subject. Yet of the pictures, whose subject is the\nhistory or mythology of Judaism and Christianity, we must carefully\ndistinguish those in which the peculiar, _i.e._, the ethical spirit of\nChristianity is revealed for perception, by the representation of men who\nare full of this spirit. These representations are in fact the highest and\nmost admirable achievements of the art of painting; and only the greatest\nmasters of this art succeeded in this, particularly Raphael and Correggio,\nand especially in their earlier pictures. Pictures of this kind are not\nproperly to be classed as historical: for, as a rule, they represent no\nevent, no action; but are merely groups of saints, with the Saviour\nhimself, often still a child, with His mother, angels, &c. In their\ncountenances, and especially in the eyes, we see the expression, the\nreflection, of the completest knowledge, that which is not directed to\nparticular things, but has fully grasped the Ideas, and thus the whole\nnature of the world and life. And this knowledge in them, reacting upon\nthe will, does not, like other knowledge, convey _motives_ to it, but on\nthe contrary has become a _quieter_ of all will, from which proceeded the\ncomplete resignation, which is the innermost spirit of Christianity, as of\nthe Indian philosophy; the surrender of all volition, conversion, the\nsuppression of will, and with it of the whole inner being of this world,\nthat is to say, salvation. Thus these masters of art, worthy of eternal\npraise, expressed perceptibly in their works the highest wisdom. And this\nis the summit of all art. It has followed the will in its adequate\nobjectivity, the Ideas, through all its grades, in which it is affected\nand its nature unfolded in so many ways, first by causes, then by stimuli,\nand finally by motives. And now art ends with the representation of the\nfree self-suppression of will, by means of the great peace which it gains\nfrom the perfect knowledge of its own nature.(56)\n\u00a7 49. The truth which lies at the foundation of all that we have hitherto\nsaid about art, is that the object of art, the representation of which is\nthe aim of the artist, and the knowledge of which must therefore precede\nhis work as its germ and source, is an Idea in Plato\u2019s sense, and never\nanything else; not the particular thing, the object of common\napprehension, and not the concept, the object of rational thought and of\nscience. Although the Idea and the concept have something in common,\nbecause both represent as unity a multiplicity of real things; yet the\ngreat difference between them has no doubt been made clear and evident\nenough by what we have said about concepts in the first book, and about\nIdeas in this book. I by no means wish to assert, however, that Plato\nreally distinctly comprehended this difference; indeed many of his\nexamples of Ideas, and his discussions of them, are applicable only to\nconcepts. Meanwhile we leave this question alone and go on our own way,\nglad when we come upon traces of any great and noble mind, yet not\nfollowing his footsteps but our own aim. The _concept_ is abstract,\ndiscursive, undetermined within its own sphere, only determined by its\nlimits, attainable and comprehensible by him who has only reason,\ncommunicable by words without any other assistance, entirely exhausted by\nits definition. The _Idea_ on the contrary, although defined as the\nadequate representative of the concept, is always object of perception,\nand although representing an infinite number of particular things, is yet\nthoroughly determined. It is never known by the individual as such, but\nonly by him who has raised himself above all willing and all individuality\nto the pure subject of knowing. Thus it is only attainable by the man of\ngenius, and by him who, for the most part through the assistance of the\nworks of genius, has reached an exalted frame of mind, by increasing his\npower of pure knowing. It is therefore not absolutely but only\nconditionally communicable, because the Idea, comprehended and repeated in\nthe work of art, appeals to every one only according to the measure of his\nown intellectual worth. So that just the most excellent works of every\nart, the noblest productions of genius, must always remain sealed books to\nthe dull majority of men, inaccessible to them, separated from them by a\nwide gulf, just as the society of princes is inaccessible to the common\npeople. It is true that even the dullest of them accept on authority\nrecognisedly great works, lest otherwise they should argue their own\nincompetence; but they wait in silence, always ready to express their\ncondemnation, as soon as they are allowed to hope that they may do so\nwithout being left to stand alone; and then their long-restrained hatred\nagainst all that is great and beautiful, and against the authors of it,\ngladly relieves itself; for such things never appealed to them, and for\nthat very reason were humiliating to them. For as a rule a man must have\nworth in himself in order to recognise it and believe in it willingly and\nfreely in others. On this rests the necessity of modesty in all merit, and\nthe disproportionately loud praise of this virtue, which alone of all its\nsisters is always included in the eulogy of every one who ventures to\npraise any distinguished man, in order to appease and quiet the wrath of\nthe unworthy. What then is modesty but hypocritical humility, by means of\nwhich, in a world swelling with base envy, a man seeks to obtain pardon\nfor excellences and merits from those who have none? For whoever\nattributes to himself no merits, because he actually has none, is not\nmodest but merely honest.\nThe _Idea_ is the unity that falls into multiplicity on account of the\ntemporal and spatial form of our intuitive apprehension; the _concept_, on\nthe contrary, is the unity reconstructed out of multiplicity by the\nabstraction of our reason; the latter may be defined as _unitas post rem_,\nthe former as _unitas ante rem_. Finally, we may express the distinction\nbetween the Idea and the concept, by a comparison, thus: the _concept_ is\nlike a dead receptacle, in which, whatever has been put, actually lies\nside by side, but out of which no more can be taken (by analytical\njudgment) than was put in (by synthetical reflection); the (Platonic)\n_Idea_, on the other hand, develops, in him who has comprehended it, ideas\nwhich are new as regards the concept of the same name; it resembles a\nliving organism, developing itself and possessed of the power of\nreproduction, which brings forth what was not put into it.\nIt follows from all that has been said, that the concept, useful as it is\nin life, and serviceable, necessary and productive as it is in science, is\nyet always barren and unfruitful in art. The comprehended Idea, on the\ncontrary, is the true and only source of every work of art. In its\npowerful originality it is only derived from life itself, from nature,\nfrom the world, and that only by the true genius, or by him whose\nmomentary inspiration reaches the point of genius. Genuine and immortal\nworks of art spring only from such direct apprehension. Just because the\nIdea is and remains object of perception, the artist is not conscious in\nthe abstract of the intention and aim of his work; not a concept, but an\nIdea floats before his mind; therefore he can give no justification of\nwhat he does. He works, as people say, from pure feeling, and\nunconsciously, indeed instinctively. On the contrary, imitators,\nmannerists, _imitatores, servum pecus_, start, in art, from the concept;\nthey observe what pleases and affects us in true works of art; understand\nit clearly, fix it in a concept, and thus abstractly, and then imitate it,\nopenly or disguisedly, with dexterity and intentionally. They suck their\nnourishment, like parasite plants, from the works of others, and like\npolypi, they become the colour of their food. We might carry comparison\nfurther, and say that they are like machines which mince fine and mingle\ntogether whatever is put into them, but can never digest it, so that the\ndifferent constituent parts may always be found again if they are sought\nout and separated from the mixture; the man of genius alone resembles the\norganised, assimilating, transforming and reproducing body. For he is\nindeed educated and cultured by his predecessors and their works; but he\nis really fructified only by life and the world directly, through the\nimpression of what he perceives; therefore the highest culture never\ninterferes with his originality. All imitators, all mannerists, apprehend\nin concepts the nature of representative works of art; but concepts can\nnever impart inner life to a work. The age, _i.e._, the dull multitude of\nevery time, knows only concepts, and sticks to them, and therefore\nreceives mannered works of art with ready and loud applause: but after a\nfew years these works become insipid, because the spirit of the age,\n_i.e._, the prevailing concepts, in which alone they could take root, have\nchanged. Only true works of art, which are drawn directly from nature and\nlife, have eternal youth and enduring power, like nature and life\nthemselves. For they belong to no age, but to humanity, and as on that\naccount they are coldly received by their own age, to which they disdain\nto link themselves closely, and because indirectly and negatively they\nexpose the existing errors, they are slowly and unwillingly recognised; on\nthe other hand, they cannot grow old, but appear to us ever fresh and new\ndown to the latest ages. Then they are no longer exposed to neglect and\nignorance, for they are crowned and sanctioned by the praise of the few\nmen capable of judging, who appear singly and rarely in the course of\nages,(57) and give in their votes, whose slowly growing number constitutes\nthe authority, which alone is the judgment-seat we mean when we appeal to\nposterity. It is these successively appearing individuals, for the mass of\nposterity will always be and remain just as perverse and dull as the mass\nof contemporaries always was and always is. We read the complaints of\ngreat men in every century about the customs of their age. They always\nsound as if they referred to our own age, for the race is always the same.\nAt every time and in every art, mannerisms have taken the place of the\nspirit, which was always the possession of a few individuals, but\nmannerisms are just the old cast-off garments of the last manifestation of\nthe spirit that existed and was recognised. From all this it appears that,\nas a rule, the praise of posterity can only be gained at the cost of the\npraise of one\u2019s contemporaries, and _vice versa_.(58)\n\u00a7 50. If the aim of all art is the communication of the comprehended Idea,\nwhich through the mind of the artist appears in such a form that it is\npurged and isolated from all that is foreign to it, and may now be grasped\nby the man of weaker comprehension and no productive faculty; if further,\nit is forbidden in art to start from the concept, we shall not be able to\nconsent to the intentional and avowed employment of a work of art for the\nexpression of a concept; this is the case in the _Allegory_. An allegory\nis a work of art which means something different from what it represents.\nBut the object of perception, and consequently also the Idea, expresses\nitself directly and completely, and does not require the medium of\nsomething else which implies or indicates it. Thus, that which in this way\nis indicated and represented by something entirely different, because it\ncannot itself be made object of perception, is always a concept. Therefore\nthrough the allegory a conception has always to be signified, and\nconsequently the mind of the beholder has to be drawn away from the\nexpressed perceptible idea to one which is entirely different, abstract\nand not perceptible, and which lies quite outside the work of art. The\npicture or statue is intended to accomplish here what is accomplished far\nmore fully by a book. Now, what we hold is the end of art, representation\nof a perceivable, comprehensible Idea, is not here the end. No great\ncompleteness in the work of art is demanded for what is aimed at here. It\nis only necessary that we should see what the thing is meant to be, for,\nas soon as this has been discovered, the end is reached, and the mind is\nnow led away to quite a different kind of idea to an abstract conception,\nwhich is the end that was in view. Allegories in plastic and pictorial art\nare, therefore, nothing but hieroglyphics; the artistic value which they\nmay have as perceptible representations, belongs to them not as\nallegories, but otherwise. That the \u201cNight\u201d of Correggio, the \u201cGenius of\nFame\u201d of Hannibal Caracci, and the \u201cHours\u201d of Poussin, are very beautiful\npictures, is to be separated altogether from the fact that they are\nallegories. As allegories they do not accomplish more than a legend,\nindeed rather less. We are here again reminded of the distinction drawn\nabove between the real and the nominal significance of a picture. The\nnominal is here the allegorical as such, for example, the \u201cGenius of\nFame.\u201d The real is what is actually represented, in this case a beautiful\nwinged youth, surrounded by beautiful boys; this expresses an Idea. But\nthis real significance affects us only so long as we forget the nominal,\nallegorical significance; if we think of the latter, we forsake the\nperception, and the mind is occupied with an abstract conception; but the\ntransition from the Idea to the conception is always a fall. Indeed, that\nnominal significance, that allegorical intention, often injures the real\nsignificance, the perceptible truth. For example, the unnatural light in\nthe \u201cNight\u201d of Correggio, which, though beautifully executed, has yet a\nmerely allegorical motive, and is really impossible. If then an\nallegorical picture has artistic value, it is quite separate from and\nindependent of what it accomplishes as allegory. Such a work of art serves\ntwo ends at once, the expression of a conception and the expression of an\nIdea. Only the latter can be an end of art; the other is a foreign end,\nthe trifling amusement of making a picture also do service as a legend, as\na hieroglyphic, invented for the pleasure of those to whom the true nature\nof art can never appeal. It is the same thing as when a work of art is\nalso a useful implement of some kind, in which case it also serves two\nends; for example, a statue which is at the same time a candelabrum or a\ncaryatide; or a bas-relief, which is also the shield of Achilles. True\nlovers of art will allow neither the one nor the other. It is true that an\nallegorical picture may, because of this quality, produce a vivid\nimpression upon the feelings; but when this is the case, a legend would\nunder the same circumstances produce the same effect. For example, if the\ndesire of fame were firmly and lastingly rooted in the heart of a man,\nbecause he regarded it as his rightful possession, which is only withheld\nfrom him so long as he has not produced the charter of his ownership; and\nif the Genius of Fame, with his laurel crown, were to appear to such a\nman, his whole mind would be excited, and his powers called into activity;\nbut the same effect would be produced if he were suddenly to see the word\n\u201cfame,\u201d in large distinct letters on the wall. Or if a man has made known\na truth, which is of importance either as a maxim for practical life, or\nas insight for science, but it has not been believed; an allegorical\npicture representing time as it lifts the veil, and discloses the naked\nfigure of Truth, will affect him powerfully; but the same effect would be\nproduced by the legend: \u201c_Le temps d\u00e9couvre la v\u00e9rit\u00e9._\u201d For what really\nproduces the effect here is the abstract thought, not the object of\nperception.\nIf then, in accordance with what has been said, allegory in plastic and\npictorial art is a mistaken effort, serving an end which is entirely\nforeign to art, it becomes quite unbearable when it leads so far astray\nthat the representation of forced and violently introduced subtilties\ndegenerates into absurdity. Such, for example, is a tortoise, to represent\nfeminine seclusion; the downward glance of Nemesis into the drapery of her\nbosom, signifying that she can see into what is hidden; the explanation of\nBellori that Hannibal Carracci represents voluptuousness clothed in a\nyellow robe, because he wishes to indicate that her lovers soon fade and\nbecome yellow as straw. If there is absolutely no connection between the\nrepresentation and the conception signified by it, founded on subsumption\nunder the concept, or association of Ideas; but the signs and the things\nsignified are combined in a purely conventional manner, by positive,\naccidentally introduced laws; then I call this degenerate kind of allegory\n_Symbolism_. Thus the rose is the symbol of secrecy, the laurel is the\nsymbol of fame, the palm is the symbol of peace, the scallop-shell is the\nsymbol of pilgrimage, the cross is the symbol of the Christian religion.\nTo this class also belongs all significance of mere colour, as yellow is\nthe colour of falseness, and blue is the colour of fidelity. Such symbols\nmay often be of use in life, but their value is foreign to art. They are\nsimply to be regarded as hieroglyphics, or like Chinese word-writing, and\nreally belong to the same class as armorial bearings, the bush that\nindicates a public-house, the key of the chamberlain, or the leather of\nthe mountaineer. If, finally, certain historical or mythical persons, or\npersonified conceptions, are represented by certain fixed symbols, these\nare properly called _emblems_. Such are the beasts of the Evangelist, the\nowl of Minerva, the apple of Paris, the Anchor of Hope, &c. For the most\npart, however, we understand by emblems those simple allegorical\nrepresentations explained by a motto, which are meant to express a moral\ntruth, and of which large collections have been made by J. Camerarius,\nAlciatus, and others. They form the transition to poetical allegory, of\nwhich we shall have more to say later. Greek sculpture devotes itself to\nthe perception, and therefore it is _\u00e6sthetical_; Indian sculpture devotes\nitself to the conception, and therefore it is merely _symbolical_.\nThis conclusion in regard to allegory, which is founded on our\nconsideration of the nature of art and quite consistent with it, is\ndirectly opposed to the opinion of Winckelmann, who, far from explaining\nallegory, as we do, as something quite foreign to the end of art, and\noften interfering with it, always speaks in favour of it, and indeed\n(Works, vol. i. p. 55) places the highest aim of art in the\n\u201crepresentation of universal conceptions, and non-sensuous things.\u201d We\nleave it to every one to adhere to whichever view he pleases. Only the\ntruth became very clear to me from these and similar views of Winckelmann\nconnected with his peculiar metaphysic of the beautiful, that one may have\nthe greatest susceptibility for artistic beauty, and the soundest judgment\nin regard to it, without being able to give an abstract and strictly\nphilosophical justification of the nature of the beautiful; just as one\nmay be very noble and virtuous, and may have a tender conscience, which\ndecides with perfect accuracy in particular cases, without on that account\nbeing in a position to investigate and explain in the abstract the ethical\nsignificance of action.\nAllegory has an entirely different relation to poetry from that which it\nhas to plastic and pictorial art, and although it is to be rejected in the\nlatter, it is not only permissible, but very serviceable to the former.\nFor in plastic and pictorial art it leads away from what is perceptibly\ngiven, the proper object of all art, to abstract thoughts; but in poetry\nthe relation is reversed; for here what is directly given in words is the\nconcept, and the first aim is to lead from this to the object of\nperception, the representation of which must be undertaken by the\nimagination of the hearer. If in plastic and pictorial art we are led from\nwhat is immediately given to something else, this must always be a\nconception, because here only the abstract cannot be given directly; but a\nconception must never be the source, and its communication must never be\nthe end of a work of art. In poetry, on the contrary, the conception is\nthe material, the immediately given, and therefore we may very well leave\nit, in order to call up perceptions which are quite different, and in\nwhich the end is reached. Many a conception or abstract thought may be\nquite indispensable to the connection of a poem, which is yet, in itself\nand directly, quite incapable of being perceived; and then it is often\nmade perceptible by means of some example which is subsumed under it. This\ntakes place in every trope, every metaphor, simile, parable, and allegory,\nall of which differ only in the length and completeness of their\nexpression. Therefore, in the arts which employ language as their medium,\nsimiles and allegories are of striking effect. How beautifully Cervantes\nsays of sleep in order to express the fact that it frees us from all\nspiritual and bodily suffering, \u201cIt is a mantle that covers all mankind.\u201d\nHow beautifully Kleist expresses allegorically the thought that\nphilosophers and men of science enlighten mankind, in the line, \u201cThose\nwhose midnight lamp lights the world.\u201d How strongly and sensuously Homer\ndescribes the harmful Ate when he says: \u201cShe has tender feet, for she\nwalks not on the hard earth, but treads on the heads of men\u201d (Il. xix.\n91.) How forcibly we are struck by Menenius Agrippa\u2019s fable of the belly\nand the limbs, addressed to the people of Rome when they seceded. How\nbeautifully Plato\u2019s figure of the Cave, at the beginning of the seventh\nbook of the \u201cRepublic\u201d to which we have already referred, expresses a very\nabstract philosophical dogma. The fable of Persephone is also to be\nregarded as a deeply significant allegory of philosophical tendency, for\nshe became subject to the nether world by tasting a pomegranate. This\nbecomes peculiarly enlightening from Goethe\u2019s treatment of the fable, as\nan episode in the _Triumph der Empfindsamkeit_, which is beyond all\npraise. Three detailed allegorical works are known to me, one, open and\navowed, is the incomparable \u201cCriticon\u201d of Balthasar Gracian. It consists\nof a great rich web of connected and highly ingenious allegories, that\nserve here as the fair clothing of moral truths, to which he thus imparts\nthe most perceptible form, and astonishes us by the richness of his\ninvention. The two others are concealed allegories, \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and\n\u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels.\u201d The first is an allegory of the life of every man,\nwho will not, like others, be careful, merely for his own welfare, but\nfollows some objective, ideal end, which has taken possession of his\nthoughts and will; and certainly, in this world, he has then a strange\nappearance. In the case of Gulliver we have only to take everything\nphysical as spiritual or intellectual, in order to see what the \u201csatirical\nrogue,\u201d as Hamlet would call him, meant by it. Such, then, in the poetical\nallegory, the conception is always the given, which it tries to make\nperceptible by means of a picture; it may sometimes be expressed or\nassisted by a painted picture. Such a picture will not be regarded as a\nwork of art, but only as a significant symbol, and it makes no claim to\npictorial, but only to poetical worth. Such is that beautiful allegorical\nvignette of Lavater\u2019s, which must be so heartening to every defender of\ntruth: a hand holding a light is stung by a wasp, while gnats are burning\nthemselves in the flame above; underneath is the motto:\n\u201cAnd although it singes the wings of the gnats,\nDestroys their heads and all their little brains,\nLight is still light;\nAnd although I am stung by the angriest wasp,\nI will not let it go.\u201d\nTo this class also belongs the gravestone with the burnt-out, smoking\ncandle, and the inscription\u2014\n\u201cWhen it is out, it becomes clear\nWhether the candle was tallow or wax.\u201d\nFinally, of this kind is an old German genealogical tree, in which the\nlast representative of a very ancient family thus expresses his\ndetermination to live his life to the end in abstinence and perfect\nchastity, and therefore to let his race die out; he represents himself at\nthe root of the high-branching tree cutting it over himself with shears.\nIn general all those symbols referred to above, commonly called emblems,\nwhich might also be defined as short painted fables with obvious morals,\nbelong to this class. Allegories of this kind are always to be regarded as\nbelonging to poetry, not to painting, and as justified thereby; moreover,\nthe pictorial execution is here always a matter of secondary importance,\nand no more is demanded of it than that it shall represent the thing so\nthat we can recognise it. But in poetry, as in plastic art, the allegory\npasses into the symbol if there is merely an arbitrary connection between\nwhat it presented to perception and the abstract significance of it. For\nas all symbolism rests, at bottom, on an agreement, the symbol has this\namong other disadvantages, that in time its meaning is forgotten, and then\nit is dumb. Who would guess why the fish is a symbol of Christianity if he\ndid not know? Only a Champollion; for it is entirely a phonetic\nhieroglyphic. Therefore, as a poetical allegory, the Revelation of John\nstands much in the same position as the reliefs with _Magnus Deus sol\nMithra_, which are still constantly being explained.\n\u00a7 51. If now, with the exposition which has been given of art in general,\nwe turn from plastic and pictorial art to poetry, we shall have no doubt\nthat its aim also is the revelation of the Ideas, the grades of the\nobjectification of will, and the communication of them to the hearer with\nthe distinctness and vividness with which the poetical sense comprehends\nthem. Ideas are essentially perceptible; if, therefore, in poetry only\nabstract conceptions are directly communicated through words, it is yet\nclearly the intention to make the hearer perceive the Ideas of life in the\nrepresentatives of these conceptions, and this can only take place through\nthe assistance of his own imagination. But in order to set the imagination\nto work for the accomplishment of this end, the abstract conceptions,\nwhich are the immediate material of poetry as of dry prose, must be so\narranged that their spheres intersect each other in such a way that none\nof them can remain in its abstract universality; but, instead of it, a\nperceptible representative appears to the imagination; and this is always\nfurther modified by the words of the poet according to what his intention\nmay be. As the chemist obtains solid precipitates by combining perfectly\nclear and transparent fluids; the poet understands how to precipitate, as\nit were, the concrete, the individual, the perceptible idea, out of the\nabstract and transparent universality of the concepts by the manner in\nwhich he combines them. For the Idea can only be known by perception; and\nknowledge of the Idea is the end of art. The skill of a master, in poetry\nas in chemistry, enables us always to obtain the precise precipitate we\nintended. This end is assisted by the numerous epithets in poetry, by\nmeans of which the universality of every concept is narrowed more and more\ntill we reach the perceptible. Homer attaches to almost every substantive\nan adjective, whose concept intersects and considerably diminishes the\nsphere of the concept of the substantive, which is thus brought so much\nthe nearer to perception: for example\u2014\n\u201c\u0395\u03bd \u03b4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u1fbd \u03a9\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u1ff3 \u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03c6\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f21\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf,\n\u1f19\u03bb\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd \u03bd\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9 \u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd.\u201d\n(\u201cOccidit vero in Oceanum splendidum lumen solis,\nTrahens noctem nigram super almam terram.\u201d)\nAnd\u2014\n\u201cWhere gentle winds from the blue heavens sigh,\nThere stand the myrtles still, the laurel high,\u201d\u2014\ncalls up before the imagination by means of a few concepts the whole\ndelight of a southern clime.\nRhythm and rhyme are quite peculiar aids to poetry. I can give no other\nexplanation of their incredibly powerful effect than that our faculties of\nperception have received from time, to which they are essentially bound,\nsome quality on account of which we inwardly follow, and, as it were,\nconsent to each regularly recurring sound. In this way rhythm and rhyme\nare partly a means of holding our attention, because we willingly follow\nthe poem read, and partly they produce in us a blind consent to what is\nread prior to any judgment, and this gives the poem a certain emphatic\npower of convincing independent of all reasons.\nFrom the general nature of the material, that is, the concepts, which\npoetry uses to communicate the Ideas, the extent of its province is very\ngreat. The whole of nature, the Ideas of all grades, can be represented by\nmeans of it, for it proceeds according to the Idea it has to impart, so\nthat its representations are sometimes descriptive, sometimes narrative,\nand sometimes directly dramatic. If, in the representation of the lower\ngrades of the objectivity of will, plastic and pictorial art generally\nsurpass it, because lifeless nature, and even brute nature, reveals almost\nits whole being in a single well-chosen moment; man, on the contrary, so\nfar as he does not express himself by the mere form and expression of his\nperson, but through a series of actions and the accompanying thoughts and\nemotions, is the principal object of poetry, in which no other art can\ncompete with it, for here the progress or movement which cannot be\nrepresented in plastic or pictorial art just suits its purpose.\nThe revelation of the Idea, which is the highest grade of the objectivity\nof will, the representation of man in the connected series of his efforts\nand actions, is thus the great problem of poetry. It is true that both\nexperience and history teach us to know man; yet oftener men than man,\n_i.e._, they give us empirical notes of the behaviour of men to each\nother, from which we may frame rules for our own conduct, oftener than\nthey afford us deep glimpses of the inner nature of man. The latter\nfunction, however, is by no means entirely denied them; but as often as it\nis the nature of mankind itself that discloses itself to us in history or\nin our own experience, we have comprehended our experience, and the\nhistorian has comprehended history, with artistic eyes, poetically,\n_i.e._, according to the Idea, not the phenomenon, in its inner nature,\nnot in its relations. Our own experience is the indispensable condition of\nunderstanding poetry as of understanding history; for it is, so to speak,\nthe dictionary of the language that both speak. But history is related to\npoetry as portrait-painting is related to historical painting; the one\ngives us the true in the individual, the other the true in the universal;\nthe one has the truth of the phenomenon, and can therefore verify it from\nthe phenomenal, the other has the truth of the Idea, which can be found in\nno particular phenomenon, but yet speaks to us from them all. The poet\nfrom deliberate choice represents significant characters in significant\nsituations; the historian takes both as they come. Indeed, he must regard\nand select the circumstances and the persons, not with reference to their\ninward and true significance, which expresses the Idea, but according to\nthe outward, apparent, and relatively important significance with regard\nto the connection and the consequences. He must consider nothing in and\nfor itself in its essential character and expression, but must look at\neverything in its relations, in its connection, in its influence upon what\nfollows, and especially upon its own age. Therefore he will not overlook\nan action of a king, though of little significance, and in itself quite\ncommon, because it has results and influence. And, on the other hand,\nactions of the highest significance of particular and very eminent\nindividuals are not to be recorded by him if they have no consequences.\nFor his treatment follows the principle of sufficient reason, and\napprehends the phenomenon, of which this principle is the form. But the\npoet comprehends the Idea, the inner nature of man apart from all\nrelations, outside all time, the adequate objectivity of the\nthing-in-itself, at its highest grade. Even in that method of treatment\nwhich is necessary for the historian, the inner nature and significance of\nthe phenomena, the kernel of all these shells, can never be entirely lost.\nHe who seeks for it, at any rate, may find it and recognise it. Yet that\nwhich is significant in itself, not in its relations, the real unfolding\nof the Idea, will be found far more accurately and distinctly in poetry\nthan in history, and, therefore, however paradoxical it may sound, far\nmore really genuine inner truth is to be attributed to poetry than to\nhistory. For the historian must accurately follow the particular event\naccording to life, as it develops itself in time in the manifold tangled\nchains of causes and effects. It is, however, impossible that he can have\nall the data for this; he cannot have seen all and discovered all. He is\nforsaken at every moment by the original of his picture, or a false one\nsubstitutes itself for it, and this so constantly that I think I may\nassume that in all history the false outweighs the true. The poet, on the\ncontrary, has comprehended the Idea of man from some definite side which\nis to be represented; thus it is the nature of his own self that\nobjectifies itself in it for him. His knowledge, as we explained above\nwhen speaking of sculpture, is half _a priori_; his ideal stands before\nhis mind firm, distinct, brightly illuminated, and cannot forsake him;\ntherefore he shows us, in the mirror of his mind, the Idea pure and\ndistinct, and his delineation of it down to the minutest particular is\ntrue as life itself.(59) The great ancient historians are, therefore, in\nthose particulars in which their data fail them, for example, in the\nspeeches of their heroes\u2014poets; indeed their whole manner of handling\ntheir material approaches to the epic. But this gives their\nrepresentations unity, and enables them to retain inner truth, even when\noutward truth was not accessible, or indeed was falsified. And as we\ncompared history to portrait-painting, in contradistinction to poetry,\nwhich corresponds to historical painting, we find that Winckelmann\u2019s\nmaxim, that the portrait ought to be the ideal of the individual, was\nfollowed by the ancient historians, for they represent the individual in\nsuch a way as to bring out that side of the Idea of man which is expressed\nin it. Modern historians, on the contrary, with few exceptions, give us in\ngeneral only \u201ca dust-bin and a lumber-room, and at the most a chronicle of\nthe principal political events.\u201d Therefore, whoever desires to know man in\nhis inner nature, identical in all its phenomena and developments, to know\nhim according to the Idea, will find that the works of the great, immortal\npoet present a far truer, more distinct picture, than the historians can\never give. For even the best of the historians are, as poets, far from the\nfirst; and moreover their hands are tied. In this aspect the relation\nbetween the historian and the poet may be illustrated by the following\ncomparison. The mere, pure historian, who works only according to data, is\nlike a man, who without any knowledge of mathematics, has investigated the\nrelations of certain figures, which he has accidentally found, by\nmeasuring them; and the problem thus empirically solved is affected of\ncourse by all the errors of the drawn figure. The poet, on the other hand,\nis like the mathematician, who constructs these relations _a priori_ in\npure perception, and expresses them not as they actually are in the drawn\nfigure, but as they are in the Idea, which the drawing is intended to\nrender for the senses. Therefore Schiller says:\u2014\n\u201cWhat has never anywhere come to pass,\nThat alone never grows old.\u201d\nIndeed I must attribute greater value to biographies, and especially to\nautobiographies, in relation to the knowledge of the nature of man, than\nto history proper, at least as it is commonly handled. Partly because in\nthe former the data can be collected more accurately and completely than\nin the latter; partly, because in history proper, it is not so much men as\nnations and heroes that act, and the individuals who do appear, seem so\nfar off, surrounded with such pomp and circumstance, clothed in the stiff\nrobes of state, or heavy, inflexible armour, that it is really hard\nthrough all this to recognise the human movements. On the other hand, the\nlife of the individual when described with truth, in a narrow sphere,\nshows the conduct of men in all its forms and subtilties, the excellence,\nthe virtue, and even holiness of a few, the perversity, meanness, and\nknavery of most, the dissolute profligacy of some. Besides, in the only\naspect we are considering here, that of the inner significance of the\nphenomenal, it is quite the same whether the objects with which the action\nis concerned, are, relatively considered, trifling or important,\nfarm-houses or kingdoms: for all these things in themselves are without\nsignificance, and obtain it only in so far as the will is moved by them.\nThe motive has significance only through its relation to the will, while\nthe relation which it has as a thing to other things like itself, does not\nconcern us here. As a circle of one inch in diameter, and a circle of\nforty million miles in diameter, have precisely the same geometrical\nproperties, so are the events and the history of a village and a kingdom\nessentially the same; and we may study and learn to know mankind as well\nin the one as in the other. It is also a mistake to suppose that\nautobiographies are full of deceit and dissimulation. On the contrary,\nlying (though always possible) is perhaps more difficult there than\nelsewhere. Dissimulation is easiest in mere conversation; indeed, though\nit may sound paradoxical, it is really more difficult even in a letter.\nFor in the case of a letter the writer is alone, and looks into himself,\nand not out on the world, so that what is strange and distant does not\neasily approach him; and he has not the test of the impression made upon\nanother before his eyes. But the receiver of the letter peruses it quietly\nin a mood unknown to the writer, reads it repeatedly and at different\ntimes, and thus easily finds out the concealed intention. We also get to\nknow an author as a man most easily from his books, because all these\ncircumstances act here still more strongly and permanently. And in an\nautobiography it is so difficult to dissimulate, that perhaps there does\nnot exist a single one that is not, as a whole, more true, than any\nhistory that ever was written. The man who writes his own life surveys it\nas a whole, the particular becomes small, the near becomes distant, the\ndistant becomes near again, the motives that influenced him shrink; he\nseats himself at the confessional, and has done so of his own free will;\nthe spirit of lying does not so easily take hold of him here, for there is\nalso in every man an inclination to truth which has first to be overcome\nwhenever he lies, and which here has taken up a specially strong position.\nThe relation between biography and the history of nations may be made\nclear for perception by means of the following comparison: History shows\nus mankind as a view from a high mountain shows us nature; we see much at\na time, wide stretches, great masses, but nothing is distinct nor\nrecognisable in all the details of its own peculiar nature. On the other\nhand, the representation of the life of the individual shows us the man,\nas we see nature if we go about among her trees, plants, rocks, and\nwaters. But in landscape-painting, in which the artist lets us look at\nnature with his eyes, the knowledge of the Ideas, and the condition of\npure will-less knowing, which is demanded by these, is made much easier\nfor us; and, in the same way, poetry is far superior both to history and\nbiography, in the representation of the Ideas which may be looked for in\nall three. For here also genius holds up to us the magic glass, in which\nall that is essential and significant appears before us collected and\nplaced in the clearest light, and what is accidental and foreign is left\nout.(60)\nThe representation of the Idea of man, which is the work of the poet, may\nbe performed, so that what is represented is also the representer. This is\nthe case in lyrical poetry, in songs, properly so called, in which the\npoet only perceives vividly his own state and describes it. Thus a certain\nsubjectivity is essential to this kind of poetry from the nature of its\nobject. Again, what is to be represented may be entirely different from\nhim who represents it, as is the case in all other kinds of poetry, in\nwhich the poet more or less conceals himself behind his representation,\nand at last disappears altogether. In the ballad the poet still expresses\nto some extent his own state through the tone and proportion of the whole;\ntherefore, though much more objective than the lyric, it has yet something\nsubjective. This becomes less in the idyll, still less in the romantic\npoem, almost entirely disappears in the true epic, and even to the last\nvestige in the drama, which is the most objective and, in more than one\nrespect, the completest and most difficult form of poetry. The lyrical\nform of poetry is consequently the easiest, and although art, as a whole,\nbelongs only to the true man of genius, who so rarely appears, even a man\nwho is not in general very remarkable may produce a beautiful song if, by\nactual strong excitement from without, some inspiration raises his mental\npowers; for all that is required for this is a lively perception of his\nown state at a moment of emotional excitement. This is proved by the\nexistence of many single songs by individuals who have otherwise remained\nunknown; especially the German national songs, of which we have an\nexquisite collection in the \u201cWunderhorn;\u201d and also by innumerable\nlove-songs and other songs of the people in all languages;\u2014for to seize\nthe mood of a moment and embody it in a song is the whole achievement of\nthis kind of poetry. Yet in the lyrics of true poets the inner nature of\nall mankind is reflected, and all that millions of past, present, and\nfuture men have found, or will find, in the same situations, which are\nconstantly recurring, finds its exact expression in them. And because\nthese situations, by constant recurrence, are permanent as man himself and\nalways call up the same sensations, the lyrical productions of genuine\npoets remain through thousands of years true, powerful, and fresh. But if\nthe poet is always the universal man, then all that has ever moved a human\nheart, all that human nature in any situation has ever produced from\nitself, all that dwells and broods in any human breast\u2014is his theme and\nhis material, and also all the rest of nature. Therefore the poet may just\nas well sing of voluptuousness as of mysticism, be Anacreon or Angelus\nSilesius, write tragedies or comedies, represent the sublime or the common\nmind\u2014according to humour or vocation. And no one has the right to\nprescribe to the poet what he ought to be\u2014noble and sublime, moral, pious,\nChristian, one thing or another, still less to reproach him because he is\none thing and not another. He is the mirror of mankind, and brings to its\nconsciousness what it feels and does.\nIf we now consider more closely the nature of the lyric proper, and select\nas examples exquisite and pure models, not those that approach in any way\nto some other form of poetry, such as the ballad, the elegy, the hymn, the\nepigram, &c., we shall find that the peculiar nature of the lyric, in the\nnarrowest sense, is this: It is the subject of will, _i.e._, his own\nvolition, which the consciousness of the singer feels; often as a released\nand satisfied desire (joy), but still oftener as a restricted desire\n(grief), always as an emotion, a passion, a moved frame of mind. Besides\nthis, however, and along with it, by the sight of surrounding nature, the\nsinger becomes conscious of himself as the subject of pure, will-less\nknowing, whose unbroken blissful peace now appears, in contrast to the\nstress of desire which is always restricted and always needy. The feeling\nof this contrast, this alternation, is really what the lyric as a whole\nexpresses, and what principally constitutes the lyrical state of mind. In\nit pure knowing comes to us, as it were, to deliver us from desire and its\nstain; we follow, but only for an instant; desire, the remembrance of our\nown personal ends, tears us anew from peaceful contemplation; yet ever\nagain the next beautiful surrounding in which the pure will-less knowledge\npresents itself to us, allures us away from desire. Therefore, in the\nlyric and the lyrical mood, desire (the personal interest of the ends),\nand pure perception of the surrounding presented, are wonderfully mingled\nwith each other; connections between them are sought for and imagined; the\nsubjective disposition, the affection of the will, imparts its own hue to\nthe perceived surrounding, and conversely, the surroundings communicate\nthe reflex of their colour to the will. The true lyric is the expression\nof the whole of this mingled and divided state of mind. In order to make\nclear by examples this abstract analysis of a frame of mind that is very\nfar from all abstraction, any of the immortal songs of Goethe may be\ntaken. As specially adapted for this end I shall recommend only a few:\n\u201cThe Shepherd\u2019s Lament,\u201d \u201cWelcome and Farewell,\u201d \u201cTo the Moon,\u201d \u201cOn the\nLake,\u201d \u201cAutumn;\u201d also the songs in the \u201cWunderhorn\u201d are excellent\nexamples; particularly the one which begins, \u201cO Bremen, I must now leave\nthee.\u201d As a comical and happy parody of the lyrical character a song of\nVoss strikes me as remarkable. It describes the feeling of a drunk plumber\nfalling from a tower, who observes in passing that the clock on the tower\nis at half-past eleven, a remark which is quite foreign to his condition,\nand thus belongs to knowledge free from will. Whoever accepts the view\nthat has been expressed of the lyrical frame of mind, will also allow,\nthat it is the sensuous and poetical knowledge of the principle which I\nestablished in my essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason, and have\nalso referred to in this work, that the identity of the subject of knowing\nwith that of willing may be called the miracle \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03c7\u03b7\u03bd; so that the\npoetical effect of the lyric rests finally on the truth of that principle.\nIn the course of life these two subjects, or, in popular language, head\nand heart, are ever becoming further apart; men are always separating more\nbetween their subjective feeling and their objective knowledge. In the\nchild the two are still entirely blended together; it scarcely knows how\nto distinguish itself from its surroundings, it is at one with them. In\nthe young man all perception chiefly affects feeling and mood, and even\nmingles with it, as Byron very beautifully expresses\u2014\n\u201cI live not in myself, but I become\nPortion of that around me; and to me\nHigh mountains are a feeling.\u201d\nThis is why the youth clings so closely to the perceptible and outward\nside of things; this is why he is only fit for lyrical poetry, and only\nthe full-grown man is capable of the drama. The old man we can think of as\nat the most an epic poet, like Ossian, and Homer, for narration is\ncharacteristic of old age.\nIn the more objective kinds of poetry, especially in the romance, the\nepic, and the drama, the end, the revelation of the Idea of man, is\nprincipally attained by two means, by true and profound representation of\nsignificant characters, and by the invention of pregnant situations in\nwhich they disclose themselves. For as it is incumbent upon the chemist\nnot only to exhibit the simple elements, pure and genuine, and their\nprincipal compounds, but also to expose them to the influence of such\nreagents as will clearly and strikingly bring out their peculiar\nqualities, so is it incumbent on the poet not only to present to us\nsignificant characters truly and faithfully as nature itself; but, in\norder that we may get to know them, he must place them in those situations\nin which their peculiar qualities will fully unfold themselves, and appear\ndistinctly in sharp outline; situations which are therefore called\nsignificant. In real life, and in history, situations of this kind are\nrarely brought about by chance, and they stand alone, lost and concealed\nin the multitude of those which are insignificant. The complete\nsignificance of the situations ought to distinguish the romance, the epic,\nand the drama from real life as completely as the arrangement and\nselection of significant characters. In both, however, absolute truth is a\nnecessary condition of their effect, and want of unity in the characters,\ncontradiction either of themselves or of the nature of humanity in\ngeneral, as well as impossibility, or very great improbability in the\nevents, even in mere accessories, offend just as much in poetry as badly\ndrawn figures, false perspective, or wrong lighting in painting. For both\nin poetry and painting we demand the faithful mirror of life, of man, of\nthe world, only made more clear by the representation, and more\nsignificant by the arrangement. For there is only one end of all the arts,\nthe representation of the Ideas; and their essential difference lies\nsimply in the different grades of the objectification of will to which the\nIdeas that are to be represented belong. This also determines the material\nof the representation. Thus the arts which are most widely separated may\nyet throw light on each other. For example, in order to comprehend fully\nthe Ideas of water it is not sufficient to see it in the quiet pond or in\nthe evenly-flowing stream; but these Ideas disclose themselves fully only\nwhen the water appears under all circumstances and exposed to all kinds of\nobstacles. The effects of the varied circumstances and obstacles give it\nthe opportunity of fully exhibiting all its qualities. This is why we find\nit beautiful when it tumbles, rushes, and foams, or leaps into the air, or\nfalls in a cataract of spray; or, lastly, if artificially confined it\nsprings up in a fountain. Thus showing itself different under different\ncircumstances, it yet always faithfully asserts its character; it is just\nas natural to it to spout up as to lie in glassy stillness; it is as ready\nfor the one as for the other as soon as the circumstances appear. Now,\nwhat the engineer achieves with the fluid matter of water, the architect\nachieves with the rigid matter of stone, and just this the epic or\ndramatic poet achieves with the Idea of man. Unfolding and rendering\ndistinct the Idea expressing itself in the object of every art, the Idea\nof the will which objectifies itself at each grade, is the common end of\nall the arts. The life of man, as it shows itself for the most part in the\nreal world, is like the water, as it is generally seen in the pond and the\nriver; but in the epic, the romance, the tragedy, selected characters are\nplaced in those circumstances in which all their special qualities unfold\nthemselves, the depths of the human heart are revealed, and become visible\nin extraordinary and very significant actions. Thus poetry objectifies the\nIdea of man, an Idea which has the peculiarity of expressing itself in\nhighly individual characters.\nTragedy is to be regarded, and is recognised as the summit of poetical\nart, both on account of the greatness of its effect and the difficulty of\nits achievement. It is very significant for our whole system, and well\nworthy of observation, that the end of this highest poetical achievement\nis the representation of the terrible side of life. The unspeakable pain,\nthe wail of humanity, the triumph of evil, the scornful mastery of chance,\nand the irretrievable fall of the just and innocent, is here presented to\nus; and in this lies a significant hint of the nature of the world and of\nexistence. It is the strife of will with itself, which here, completely\nunfolded at the highest grade of its objectivity, comes into fearful\nprominence. It becomes visible in the suffering of men, which is now\nintroduced, partly through chance and error, which appear as the rulers of\nthe world, personified as fate, on account of their insidiousness, which\neven reaches the appearance of design; partly it proceeds from man\nhimself, through the self-mortifying efforts of a few, through the\nwickedness and perversity of most. It is one and the same will that lives\nand appears in them all, but whose phenomena fight against each other and\ndestroy each other. In one individual it appears powerfully, in another\nmore weakly; in one more subject to reason, and softened by the light of\nknowledge, in another less so, till at last, in some single case, this\nknowledge, purified and heightened by suffering itself, reaches the point\nat which the phenomenon, the veil of M\u00e2ya, no longer deceives it. It sees\nthrough the form of the phenomenon, the _principium individuationis_. The\negoism which rests on this perishes with it, so that now the _motives_\nthat were so powerful before have lost their might, and instead of them\nthe complete knowledge of the nature of the world, which has a _quieting_\neffect on the will, produces resignation, the surrender not merely of\nlife, but of the very will to live. Thus we see in tragedies the noblest\nmen, after long conflict and suffering, at last renounce the ends they\nhave so keenly followed, and all the pleasures of life for ever, or else\nfreely and joyfully surrender life itself. So is it with the steadfast\nprince of Calderon; with Gretchen in \u201cFaust;\u201d with Hamlet, whom his friend\nHoratio would willingly follow, but is bade remain a while, and in this\nharsh world draw his breath in pain, to tell the story of Hamlet, and\nclear his memory; so also is it with the Maid of Orleans, the Bride of\nMessina; they all die purified by suffering, _i.e._, after the will to\nlive which was formerly in them is dead. In the \u201cMohammed\u201d of Voltaire\nthis is actually expressed in the concluding words which the dying Palmira\naddresses to Mohammad: \u201cThe world is for tyrants: live!\u201d On the other\nhand, the demand for so-called poetical justice rests on entire\nmisconception of the nature of tragedy, and, indeed, of the nature of the\nworld itself. It boldly appears in all its dulness in the criticisms which\nDr. Samuel Johnson made on particular plays of Shakespeare, for he very\nna\u00efvely laments its entire absence. And its absence is certainly obvious,\nfor in what has Ophelia, Desdemona, or Cordelia offended? But only the\ndull, optimistic, Protestant-rationalistic, or peculiarly Jewish view of\nlife will make the demand for poetical justice, and find satisfaction in\nit. The true sense of tragedy is the deeper insight, that it is not his\nown individual sins that the hero atones for, but original sin, _i.e._,\nthe crime of existence itself:\n\u201cPues el delito mayor\nDel hombre es haber nacido;\u201d\n(\u201cFor the greatest crime of man\nIs that he was born;\u201d)\nas Calderon exactly expresses it.\nI shall allow myself only one remark, more closely concerning the\ntreatment of tragedy. The representation of a great misfortune is alone\nessential to tragedy. But the many different ways in which this is\nintroduced by the poet may be brought under three specific conceptions. It\nmay happen by means of a character of extraordinary wickedness, touching\nthe utmost limits of possibility, who becomes the author of the\nmisfortune; examples of this kind are Richard III., Iago in \u201cOthello,\u201d\nShylock in \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d Franz Moor, Ph\u00e6dra of Euripides,\nCreon in the \u201cAntigone,\u201d &c., &c. Secondly, it may happen through blind\nfate, _i.e._, chance and error; a true pattern of this kind is the \u0152dipus\nRex of Sophocles, the \u201cTrachini\u00e6\u201d also; and in general most of the\ntragedies of the ancients belong to this class. Among modern tragedies,\n\u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d \u201cTancred\u201d by Voltaire, and \u201cThe Bride of Messina,\u201d are\nexamples. Lastly, the misfortune may be brought about by the mere position\nof the _dramatis person\u00e6_ with regard to each other, through their\nrelations; so that there is no need either for a tremendous error or an\nunheard-of accident, nor yet for a character whose wickedness reaches the\nlimits of human possibility; but characters of ordinary morality, under\ncircumstances such as often occur, are so situated with regard to each\nother that their position compels them, knowingly and with their eyes\nopen, to do each other the greatest injury, without any one of them being\nentirely in the wrong. This last kind of tragedy seems to me far to\nsurpass the other two, for it shows us the greatest misfortune, not as an\nexception, not as something occasioned by rare circumstances or monstrous\ncharacters, but as arising easily and of itself out of the actions and\ncharacters of men, indeed almost as essential to them, and thus brings it\nterribly near to us. In the other two kinds we may look on the prodigious\nfate and the horrible wickedness as terrible powers which certainly\nthreaten us, but only from afar, which we may very well escape without\ntaking refuge in renunciation. But in the last kind of tragedy we see that\nthose powers which destroy happiness and life are such that their path to\nus also is open at every moment; we see the greatest sufferings brought\nabout by entanglements that our fate might also partake of, and through\nactions that perhaps we also are capable of performing, and so could not\ncomplain of injustice; then shuddering we feel ourselves already in the\nmidst of hell. This last kind of tragedy is also the most difficult of\nachievement; for the greatest effect has to be produced in it with the\nleast use of means and causes of movement, merely through the position and\ndistribution of the characters; therefore even in many of the best\ntragedies this difficulty is evaded. Yet one tragedy may be referred to as\na perfect model of this kind, a tragedy which in other respects is far\nsurpassed by more than one work of the same great master; it is \u201cClavigo.\u201d\n\u201cHamlet\u201d belongs to a certain extent to this class, as far as the relation\nof Hamlet to Laertes and Ophelia is concerned. \u201cWallenstein\u201d has also this\nexcellence. \u201cFaust\u201d belongs entirely to this class, if we regard the\nevents connected with Gretchen and her brother as the principal action;\nalso the \u201cCid\u201d of Corneille, only that it lacks the tragic conclusion,\nwhile on the contrary the analogous relation of Max to Thecla has it.(61)\n\u00a7 52. Now that we have considered all the fine arts in the general way\nthat is suitable to our point of view, beginning with architecture, the\npeculiar end of which is to elucidate the objectification of will at the\nlowest grades of its visibility, in which it shows itself as the dumb\nunconscious tendency of the mass in accordance with laws, and yet already\nreveals a breach of the unity of will with itself in a conflict between\ngravity and rigidity\u2014and ending with the consideration of tragedy, which\npresents to us at the highest grades of the objectification of will this\nvery conflict with itself in terrible magnitude and distinctness; we find\nthat there is still another fine art which has been excluded from our\nconsideration, and had to be excluded, for in the systematic connection of\nour exposition there was no fitting place for it\u2014I mean _music_. It stands\nalone, quite cut off from all the other arts. In it we do not recognise\nthe copy or repetition of any Idea of existence in the world. Yet it is\nsuch a great and exceedingly noble art, its effect on the inmost nature of\nman is so powerful, and it is so entirely and deeply understood by him in\nhis inmost consciousness as a perfectly universal language, the\ndistinctness of which surpasses even that of the perceptible world itself,\nthat we certainly have more to look for in it than an _exercitum\narithmetic\u00e6 occultum nescientis se numerare animi_,(62) which Leibnitz\ncalled it. Yet he was perfectly right, as he considered only its immediate\nexternal significance, its form. But if it were nothing more, the\nsatisfaction which it affords would be like that which we feel when a sum\nin arithmetic comes out right, and could not be that intense pleasure with\nwhich we see the deepest recesses of our nature find utterance. From our\nstandpoint, therefore, at which the \u00e6sthetic effect is the criterion, we\nmust attribute to music a far more serious and deep significance,\nconnected with the inmost nature of the world and our own self, and in\nreference to which the arithmetical proportions, to which it may be\nreduced, are related, not as the thing signified, but merely as the sign.\nThat in some sense music must be related to the world as the\nrepresentation to the thing represented, as the copy to the original, we\nmay conclude from the analogy of the other arts, all of which possess this\ncharacter, and affect us on the whole in the same way as it does, only\nthat the effect of music is stronger, quicker, more necessary and\ninfallible. Further, its representative relation to the world must be very\ndeep, absolutely true, and strikingly accurate, because it is instantly\nunderstood by every one, and has the appearance of a certain\ninfallibility, because its form may be reduced to perfectly definite rules\nexpressed in numbers, from which it cannot free itself without entirely\nceasing to be music. Yet the point of comparison between music and the\nworld, the respect in which it stands to the world in the relation of a\ncopy or repetition, is very obscure. Men have practised music in all ages\nwithout being able to account for this; content to understand it directly,\nthey renounce all claim to an abstract conception of this direct\nunderstanding itself.\nI gave my mind entirely up to the impression of music in all its forms,\nand then returned to reflection and the system of thought expressed in the\npresent work, and thus I arrived at an explanation of the inner nature of\nmusic and of the nature of its imitative relation to the world\u2014which from\nanalogy had necessarily to be presupposed\u2014an explanation which is quite\nsufficient for myself, and satisfactory to my investigation, and which\nwill doubtless be equally evident to any one who has followed me thus far\nand has agreed with my view of the world. Yet I recognise the fact that it\nis essentially impossible to prove this explanation, for it assumes and\nestablishes a relation of music, as idea, to that which from its nature\ncan never be idea, and music will have to be regarded as the copy of an\noriginal which can never itself be directly presented as idea. I can\ntherefore do no more than state here, at the conclusion of this third\nbook, which has been principally devoted to the consideration of the arts,\nthe explanation of the marvellous art of music which satisfies myself, and\nI must leave the acceptance or denial of my view to the effect produced\nupon each of my readers both by music itself and by the whole system of\nthought communicated in this work. Moreover, I regard it as necessary, in\norder to be able to assent with full conviction to the exposition of the\nsignificance of music I am about to give, that one should often listen to\nmusic with constant reflection upon my theory concerning it, and for this\nagain it is necessary to be very familiar with the whole of my system of\nthought.\nThe (Platonic) Ideas are the adequate objectification of will. To excite\nor suggest the knowledge of these by means of the representation of\nparticular things (for works of art themselves are always representations\nof particular things) is the end of all the other arts, which can only be\nattained by a corresponding change in the knowing subject. Thus all these\narts objectify the will indirectly only by means of the Ideas; and since\nour world is nothing but the manifestation of the Ideas in multiplicity,\nthough their entrance into the _principium individuationis_ (the form of\nthe knowledge possible for the individual as such), music also, since it\npasses over the Ideas, is entirely independent of the phenomenal world,\nignores it altogether, could to a certain extent exist if there was no\nworld at all, which cannot be said of the other arts. Music is as _direct_\nan objectification and copy of the whole _will_ as the world itself, nay,\neven as the Ideas, whose multiplied manifestation constitutes the world of\nindividual things. Music is thus by no means like the other arts, the copy\nof the Ideas, but the _copy of the will itself_, whose objectivity the\nIdeas are. This is why the effect of music is so much more powerful and\npenetrating than that of the other arts, for they speak only of shadows,\nbut it speaks of the thing itself. Since, however, it is the same will\nwhich objectifies itself both in the Ideas and in music, though in quite\ndifferent ways, there must be, not indeed a direct likeness, but yet a\nparallel, an analogy, between music and the Ideas whose manifestation in\nmultiplicity and incompleteness is the visible world. The establishing of\nthis analogy will facilitate, as an illustration, the understanding of\nthis exposition, which is so difficult on account of the obscurity of the\nsubject.\nI recognise in the deepest tones of harmony, in the bass, the lowest\ngrades of the objectification of will, unorganised nature, the mass of the\nplanet. It is well known that all the high notes which are easily sounded,\nand die away more quickly, are produced by the vibration in their vicinity\nof the deep bass-notes. When, also, the low notes sound, the high notes\nalways sound faintly, and it is a law of harmony that only those high\nnotes may accompany a bass-note which actually already sound along with it\nof themselves (its _sons harmoniques_) on account of its vibration. This\nis analogous to the fact that the whole of the bodies and organisations of\nnature must be regarded as having come into existence through gradual\ndevelopment out of the mass of the planet; this is both their supporter\nand their source, and the same relation subsists between the high notes\nand the bass. There is a limit of depth, below which no sound is audible.\nThis corresponds to the fact that no matter can be perceived without form\nand quality, _i.e._, without the manifestation of a force which cannot be\nfurther explained, in which an Idea expresses itself, and, more generally,\nthat no matter can be entirely without will. Thus, as a certain pitch is\ninseparable from the note as such, so a certain grade of the manifestation\nof will is inseparable from matter. Bass is thus, for us, in harmony what\nunorganised nature, the crudest mass, upon which all rests, and from which\neverything originates and develops, is in the world. Now, further, in the\nwhole of the complemental parts which make up the harmony between the bass\nand the leading voice singing the melody, I recognise the whole gradation\nof the Ideas in which the will objectifies itself. Those nearer to the\nbass are the lower of these grades, the still unorganised, but yet\nmanifold phenomenal things; the higher represent to me the world of plants\nand beasts. The definite intervals of the scale are parallel to the\ndefinite grades of the objectification of will, the definite species in\nnature. The departure from the arithmetical correctness of the intervals,\nthrough some temperament, or produced by the key selected, is analogous to\nthe departure of the individual from the type of the species. Indeed, even\nthe impure discords, which give no definite interval, may be compared to\nthe monstrous abortions produced by beasts of two species, or by man and\nbeast. But to all these bass and complemental parts which make up the\n_harmony_ there is wanting that connected progress which belongs only to\nthe high voice singing the melody, and it alone moves quickly and lightly\nin modulations and runs, while all these others have only a slower\nmovement without a connection in each part for itself. The deep bass moves\nmost slowly, the representative of the crudest mass. Its rising and\nfalling occurs only by large intervals, in thirds, fourths, fifths, never\nby _one_ tone, unless it is a base inverted by double counterpoint. This\nslow movement is also physically essential to it; a quick run or shake in\nthe low notes cannot even be imagined. The higher complemental parts,\nwhich are parallel to animal life, move more quickly, but yet without\nmelodious connection and significant progress. The disconnected course of\nall the complemental parts, and their regulation by definite laws, is\nanalogous to the fact that in the whole irrational world, from the crystal\nto the most perfect animal, no being has a connected consciousness of its\nown which would make its life into a significant whole, and none\nexperiences a succession of mental developments, none perfects itself by\nculture, but everything exists always in the same way according to its\nkind, determined by fixed law. Lastly, in the _melody_, in the high,\nsinging, principal voice leading the whole and progressing with\nunrestrained freedom, in the unbroken significant connection of _one_\nthought from beginning to end representing a whole, I recognise the\nhighest grade of the objectification of will, the intellectual life and\neffort of man. As he alone, because endowed with reason, constantly looks\nbefore and after on the path of his actual life and its innumerable\npossibilities, and so achieves a course of life which is intellectual, and\ntherefore connected as a whole; corresponding to this, I say, the _melody_\nhas significant intentional connection from beginning to end. It records,\ntherefore, the history of the intellectually enlightened will. This will\nexpresses itself in the actual world as the series of its deeds; but\nmelody says more, it records the most secret history of this\nintellectually-enlightened will, pictures every excitement, every effort,\nevery movement of it, all that which the reason collects under the wide\nand negative concept of feeling, and which it cannot apprehend further\nthrough its abstract concepts. Therefore it has always been said that\nmusic is the language of feeling and of passion, as words are the language\nof reason. Plato explains it as \u1f21 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7, \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2\n\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 (_melodiarum motus, animi affectus imitans_),\nDe Leg. vii.; and also Aristotle says: \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7, \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b7\n\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1, \u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5 (_cur numeri musici et modi, qui voces sunt, moribus\nsimiles sese exhibent?_): Probl. c. 19.\nNow the nature of man consists in this, that his will strives, is\nsatisfied and strives anew, and so on for ever. Indeed, his happiness and\nwell-being consist simply in the quick transition from wish to\nsatisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish. For the absence of\nsatisfaction is suffering, the empty longing for a new wish, languor,\n_ennui_. And corresponding to this the nature of melody is a constant\ndigression and deviation from the key-note in a thousand ways, not only to\nthe harmonious intervals to the third and dominant, but to every tone, to\nthe dissonant sevenths and to the superfluous degrees; yet there always\nfollows a constant return to the key-note. In all these deviations melody\nexpresses the multifarious efforts of will, but always its satisfaction\nalso by the final return to an harmonious interval, and still more, to the\nkey-note. The composition of melody, the disclosure in it of all the\ndeepest secrets of human willing and feeling, is the work of genius, whose\naction, which is more apparent here than anywhere else, lies far from all\nreflection and conscious intention, and may be called an inspiration. The\nconception is here, as everywhere in art, unfruitful. The composer reveals\nthe inner nature of the world, and expresses the deepest wisdom in a\nlanguage which his reason does not understand; as a person under the\ninfluence of mesmerism tells things of which he has no conception when he\nawakes. Therefore in the composer, more than in any other artist, the man\nis entirely separated and distinct from the artist. Even in the\nexplanation of this wonderful art, the concept shows its poverty and\nlimitation. I shall try, however, to complete our analogy. As quick\ntransition from wish to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish,\nis happiness and well-being, so quick melodies without great deviations\nare cheerful; slow melodies, striking painful discords, and only winding\nback through many bars to the keynote are, as analogous to the delayed and\nhardly won satisfaction, sad. The delay of the new excitement of will,\nlanguor, could have no other expression than the sustained keynote, the\neffect of which would soon be unbearable; very monotonous and unmeaning\nmelodies approach this effect. The short intelligible subjects of quick\ndance-music seem to speak only of easily attained common pleasure. On the\nother hand, the _Allegro maestoso_, in elaborate movements, long passages,\nand wide deviations, signifies a greater, nobler effort towards a more\ndistant end, and its final attainment. The _Adagio_ speaks of the pain of\na great and noble effort which despises all trifling happiness. But how\nwonderful is the effect of the _minor_ and _major_! How astounding that\nthe change of half a tone, the entrance of a minor third instead of a\nmajor, at once and inevitably forces upon us an anxious painful feeling,\nfrom which again we are just as instantaneously delivered by the major.\nThe _Adagio_ lengthens in the minor the expression of the keenest pain,\nand becomes even a convulsive wail. Dance-music in the minor seems to\nindicate the failure of that trifling happiness which we ought rather to\ndespise, seems to speak of the attainment of a lower end with toil and\ntrouble. The inexhaustibleness of possible melodies corresponds to the\ninexhaustibleness of Nature in difference of individuals, physiognomies,\nand courses of life. The transition from one key to an entirely different\none, since it altogether breaks the connection with what went before, is\nlike death, for the individual ends in it; but the will which appeared in\nthis individual lives after him as before him, appearing in other\nindividuals, whose consciousness, however, has no connection with his.\nBut it must never be forgotten, in the investigation of all these\nanalogies I have pointed out, that music has no direct, but merely an\nindirect relation to them, for it never expresses the phenomenon, but only\nthe inner nature, the in-itself of all phenomena, the will itself. It does\nnot therefore express this or that particular and definite joy, this or\nthat sorrow, or pain, or horror, or delight, or merriment, or peace of\nmind; but joy, sorrow, pain, horror, delight, merriment, peace of mind\n_themselves_, to a certain extent in the abstract, their essential nature,\nwithout accessories, and therefore without their motives. Yet we\ncompletely understand them in this extracted quintessence. Hence it arises\nthat our imagination is so easily excited by music, and now seeks to give\nform to that invisible yet actively moved spirit-world which speaks to us\ndirectly, and clothe it with flesh and blood, _i.e._, to embody it in an\nanalogous example. This is the origin of the song with words, and finally\nof the opera, the text of which should therefore never forsake that\nsubordinate position in order to make itself the chief thing and the music\na mere means of expressing it, which is a great misconception and a piece\nof utter perversity; for music always expresses only the quintessence of\nlife and its events, never these themselves, and therefore their\ndifferences do not always affect it. It is precisely this universality,\nwhich belongs exclusively to it, together with the greatest\ndeterminateness, that gives music the high worth which it has as the\npanacea for all our woes. Thus, if music is too closely united to the\nwords, and tries to form itself according to the events, it is striving to\nspeak a language which is not its own. No one has kept so free from this\nmistake as Rossini; therefore his music speaks _its own language_ so\ndistinctly and purely that it requires no words, and produces its full\neffect when rendered by instruments alone.\nAccording to all this, we may regard the phenomenal world, or nature, and\nmusic as two different expressions of the same thing, which is therefore\nitself the only medium of their analogy, so that a knowledge of it is\ndemanded in order to understand that analogy. Music, therefore, if\nregarded as an expression of the world, is in the highest degree a\nuniversal language, which is related indeed to the universality of\nconcepts, much as they are related to the particular things. Its\nuniversality, however, is by no means that empty universality of\nabstraction, but quite of a different kind, and is united with thorough\nand distinct definiteness. In this respect it resembles geometrical\nfigures and numbers, which are the universal forms of all possible objects\nof experience and applicable to them all _a priori_, and yet are not\nabstract but perceptible and thoroughly determined. All possible efforts,\nexcitements, and manifestations of will, all that goes on in the heart of\nman and that reason includes in the wide, negative concept of feeling, may\nbe expressed by the infinite number of possible melodies, but always in\nthe universal, in the mere form, without the material, always according to\nthe thing-in-itself, not the phenomenon, the inmost soul, as it were, of\nthe phenomenon, without the body. This deep relation which music has to\nthe true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable music\nplayed to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to disclose to us\nits most secret meaning, and appears as the most accurate and distinct\ncommentary upon it. This is so truly the case, that whoever gives himself\nup entirely to the impression of a symphony, seems to see all the possible\nevents of life and the world take place in himself, yet if he reflects, he\ncan find no likeness between the music and the things that passed before\nhis mind. For, as we have said, music is distinguished from all the other\narts by the fact that it is not a copy of the phenomenon, or, more\naccurately, the adequate objectivity of will, but is the direct copy of\nthe will itself, and therefore exhibits itself as the metaphysical to\neverything physical in the world, and as the thing-in-itself to every\nphenomenon. We might, therefore, just as well call the world embodied\nmusic as embodied will; and this is the reason why music makes every\npicture, and indeed every scene of real life and of the world, at once\nappear with higher significance, certainly all the more in proportion as\nits melody is analogous to the inner spirit of the given phenomenon. It\nrests upon this that we are able to set a poem to music as a song, or a\nperceptible representation as a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such\nparticular pictures of human life, set to the universal language of music,\nare never bound to it or correspond to it with stringent necessity; but\nthey stand to it only in the relation of an example chosen at will to a\ngeneral concept. In the determinateness of the real, they represent that\nwhich music expresses in the universality of mere form. For melodies are\nto a certain extent, like general concepts, an abstraction from the\nactual. This actual world, then, the world of particular things, affords\nthe object of perception, the special and individual, the particular case,\nboth to the universality of the concepts and to the universality of the\nmelodies. But these two universalities are in a certain respect opposed to\neach other; for the concepts contain particulars only as the first forms\nabstracted from perception, as it were, the separated shell of things;\nthus they are, strictly speaking, _abstracta_; music, on the other hand,\ngives the inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things.\nThis relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen\nby saying the concepts are the _universalia post rem_, but music gives the\n_universalia ante rem_, and the real world the _universalia in re_. To the\nuniversal significance of a melody to which a poem has been set, it is\nquite possible to set other equally arbitrarily selected examples of the\nuniversal expressed in this poem corresponding to the significance of the\nmelody in the same degree. This is why the same composition is suitable to\nmany verses; and this is also what makes the _vaudeville_ possible. But\nthat in general a relation is possible between a composition and a\nperceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the fact that both\nare simply different expressions of the same inner being of the world.\nWhen now, in the particular case, such a relation is actually given, that\nis to say, when the composer has been able to express in the universal\nlanguage of music the emotions of will which constitute the heart of an\nevent, then the melody of the song, the music of the opera, is expressive.\nBut the analogy discovered by the composer between the two must have\nproceeded from the direct knowledge of the nature of the world unknown to\nhis reason, and must not be an imitation produced with conscious intention\nby means of conceptions, otherwise the music does not express the inner\nnature of the will itself, but merely gives an inadequate imitation of its\nphenomenon. All specially imitative music does this; for example, \u201cThe\nSeasons,\u201d by Haydn; also many passages of his \u201cCreation,\u201d in which\nphenomena of the external world are directly imitated; also all\nbattle-pieces. Such music is entirely to be rejected.\nThe unutterable depth of all music by virtue of which it floats through\nour consciousness as the vision of a paradise firmly believed in yet ever\ndistant from us, and by which also it is so fully understood and yet so\ninexplicable, rests on the fact that it restores to us all the emotions of\nour inmost nature, but entirely without reality and far removed from their\npain. So also the seriousness which is essential to it, which excludes the\nabsurd from its direct and peculiar province, is to be explained by the\nfact that its object is not the idea, with reference to which alone\ndeception and absurdity are possible; but its object is directly the will,\nand this is essentially the most serious of all things, for it is that on\nwhich all depends. How rich in content and full of significance the\nlanguage of music is, we see from the repetitions, as well as the _Da\ncapo_, the like of which would be unbearable in works composed in a\nlanguage of words, but in music are very appropriate and beneficial, for,\nin order to comprehend it fully, we must hear it twice.\nIn the whole of this exposition of music I have been trying to bring out\nclearly that it expresses in a perfectly universal language, in a\nhomogeneous material, mere tones, and with the greatest determinateness\nand truth, the inner nature, the in-itself of the world, which we think\nunder the concept of will, because will is its most distinct\nmanifestation. Further, according to my view and contention, philosophy is\nnothing but a complete and accurate repetition or expression of the nature\nof the world in very general concepts, for only in such is it possible to\nget a view of that whole nature which will everywhere be adequate and\napplicable. Thus, whoever has followed me and entered into my mode of\nthought, will not think it so very paradoxical if I say, that supposing it\nwere possible to give a perfectly accurate, complete explanation of music,\nextending even to particulars, that is to say, a detailed repetition in\nconcepts of what it expresses, this would also be a sufficient repetition\nand explanation of the world in concepts, or at least entirely parallel to\nsuch an explanation, and thus it would be the true philosophy.\nConsequently the saying of Leibnitz quoted above, which is quite accurate\nfrom a lower standpoint, may be parodied in the following way to suit our\nhigher view of music: _Musica est exercitium metaphysices occultum\nnescientis se philosophari animi_; for _scire_, to know, always means to\nhave fixed in abstract concepts. But further, on account of the truth of\nthe saying of Leibnitz, which is confirmed in various ways, music,\nregarded apart from its \u00e6sthetic or inner significance, and looked at\nmerely externally and purely empirically, is simply the means of\ncomprehending directly and in the concrete large numbers and complex\nrelations of numbers, which otherwise we could only know indirectly by\nfixing them in concepts. Therefore by the union of these two very\ndifferent but correct views of music we may arrive at a conception of the\npossibility of a philosophy of number, such as that of Pythagoras and of\nthe Chinese in Y-King, and then interpret in this sense the saying of the\nPythagoreans which Sextus Empiricus quotes (adv. Math., L. vii.): \u03c4\u1ff3\n\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u1ff3 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1fbd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd (_numero cuncta assimilantur_). And if,\nfinally, we apply this view to the interpretation of harmony and melody\ngiven above, we shall find that a mere moral philosophy without an\nexplanation of Nature, such as Socrates wanted to introduce, is precisely\nanalogous to a mere melody without harmony, which Rousseau exclusively\ndesired; and, in opposition to this mere physics and metaphysics without\nethics, will correspond to mere harmony without melody. Allow me to add to\nthese cursory observations a few more remarks concerning the analogy of\nmusic with the phenomenal world. We found in the second book that the\nhighest grade of the objectification of will, man, could not appear alone\nand isolated, but presupposed the grades below him, as these again\npresupposed the grades lower still. In the same way music, which directly\nobjectifies the will, just as the world does, is complete only in full\nharmony. In order to achieve its full effect, the high leading voice of\nthe melody requires the accompaniment of all the other voices, even to the\nlowest bass, which is to be regarded as the origin of all. The melody\nitself enters as an integral part into the harmony, as the harmony enters\ninto it, and only thus, in the full harmonious whole, music expresses what\nit aims at expressing. Thus also the one will outside of time finds its\nfull objectification only in the complete union of all the steps which\nreveal its nature in the innumerable ascending grades of distinctness. The\nfollowing analogy is also very remarkable. We have seen in the preceding\nbook that notwithstanding the self-adaptation of all the phenomena of will\nto each other as regards their species, which constitutes their\nteleological aspect, there yet remains an unceasing conflict between those\nphenomena as individuals, which is visible at every grade, and makes the\nworld a constant battle-field of all those manifestations of one and the\nsame will, whose inner contradiction with itself becomes visible through\nit. In music also there is something corresponding to this. A complete,\npure, harmonious system of tones is not only physically but arithmetically\nimpossible. The numbers themselves by which the tones are expressed have\ninextricable irrationality. There is no scale in which, when it is\ncounted, every fifth will be related to the keynote as 2 to 3, every major\nthird as 4 to 5, every minor third as 5 to 6, and so on. For if they are\ncorrectly related to the keynote, they can no longer be so to each other;\nbecause, for example, the fifth must be the minor third to the third, &c.\nFor the notes of the scale may be compared to actors who must play now one\npart, now another. Therefore a perfectly accurate system of music cannot\neven be thought, far less worked out; and on this account all possible\nmusic deviates from perfect purity; it can only conceal the discords\nessential to it by dividing them among all the notes, _i.e._, by\ntemperament. On this see Chladni\u2019s \u201cAkustik,\u201d \u00a7 30, and his \u201cKurze\nUebersicht der Schall- und Klanglehre.\u201d(63)\nI might still have something to say about the way in which music is\nperceived, namely, in and through time alone, with absolute exclusion of\nspace, and also apart from the influence of the knowledge of causality,\nthus without understanding; for the tones make the \u00e6sthetic impression as\neffect, and without obliging us to go back to their causes, as in the case\nof perception. I do not wish, however, to lengthen this discussion, as I\nhave perhaps already gone too much into detail with regard to some things\nin this Third Book, or have dwelt too much on particulars. But my aim made\nit necessary, and it will be the less disapproved if the importance and\nhigh worth of art, which is seldom sufficiently recognised, be kept in\nmind. For if, according to our view, the whole visible world is just the\nobjectification, the mirror, of the will, conducting it to knowledge of\nitself, and, indeed, as we shall soon see, to the possibility of its\ndeliverance; and if, at the same time, the world as idea, if we regard it\nin isolation, and, freeing ourselves from all volition, allow it alone to\ntake possession of our consciousness, is the most joy-giving and the only\ninnocent side of life; we must regard art as the higher ascent, the more\ncomplete development of all this, for it achieves essentially just what is\nachieved by the visible world itself, only with greater concentration,\nmore perfectly, with intention and intelligence, and therefore may be\ncalled, in the full significance of the word, the flower of life. If the\nwhole world as idea is only the visibility of will, the work of art is to\nrender this visibility more distinct. It is the _camera obscura_ which\nshows the objects more purely, and enables us to survey them and\ncomprehend them better. It is the play within the play, the stage upon the\nstage in \u201cHamlet.\u201d\nThe pleasure we receive from all beauty, the consolation which art\naffords, the enthusiasm of the artist, which enables him to forget the\ncares of life,\u2014the latter an advantage of the man of genius over other\nmen, which alone repays him for the suffering that increases in proportion\nto the clearness of consciousness, and for the desert loneliness among men\nof a different race,\u2014all this rests on the fact that the in-itself of\nlife, the will, existence itself, is, as we shall see farther on, a\nconstant sorrow, partly miserable, partly terrible; while, on the\ncontrary, as idea alone, purely contemplated, or copied by art, free from\npain, it presents to us a drama full of significance. This purely knowable\nside of the world, and the copy of it in any art, is the element of the\nartist. He is chained to the contemplation of the play, the\nobjectification of will; he remains beside it, does not get tired of\ncontemplating it and representing it in copies; and meanwhile he bears\nhimself the cost of the production of that play, _i.e._, he himself is the\nwill which objectifies itself, and remains in constant suffering. That\npure, true, and deep knowledge of the inner nature of the world becomes\nnow for him an end in itself: he stops there. Therefore it does not become\nto him a quieter of the will, as, we shall see in the next book, it does\nin the case of the saint who has attained to resignation; it does not\ndeliver him for ever from life, but only at moments, and is therefore not\nfor him a path out of life, but only an occasional consolation in it, till\nhis power, increased by this contemplation and at last tired of the play,\nlays hold on the real. The St. Cecilia of Raphael may be regarded as a\nrepresentation of this transition. To the real, then, we now turn in the\nfollowing book.\nFOURTH BOOK. THE WORLD AS WILL.\nSecond Aspect. The Assertion And Denial Of The Will To Live, When\nSelf-Consciousness Has Been Attained.\nTempore quo cognitio simul advenit, amor e medio\nsupersurrexit.\u2014_Oupnek\u2019hat,_\n_Studio Anquetil Duperron_, vol. ii. p. 216.\n\u00a7 53. The last part of our work presents itself as the most serious, for\nit relates to the action of men, the matter which concerns every one\ndirectly and can be foreign or indifferent to none. It is indeed so\ncharacteristic of the nature of man to relate everything else to action,\nthat in every systematic investigation he will always treat the part that\nhas to do with action as the result or outcome of the whole work, so far,\nat least, as it interests him, and will therefore give his most serious\nattention to this part, even if to no other. In this respect the following\npart of our work would, in ordinary language, be called practical\nphilosophy, in opposition to the theoretical, which has occupied us\nhitherto. But, in my opinion, all philosophy is theoretical, because it is\nessential to it that it should retain a purely contemplative attitude, and\nshould investigate, not prescribe. To become, on the contrary, practical,\nto guide conduct, to transform character, are old claims, which with\nfuller insight it ought finally to give up. For here, where the worth or\nworthlessness of an existence, where salvation or damnation are in\nquestion, the dead conceptions of philosophy do not decide the matter, but\nthe inmost nature of man himself, the D\u00e6mon that guides him and that has\nnot chosen him, but been chosen by him, as Plato would say; his\nintelligible character, as Kant expresses himself. Virtue cannot be taught\nany more than genius; indeed, for it the concept is just as unfruitful as\nit is in art, and in both cases can only be used as an instrument. It\nwould, therefore, be just as absurd to expect that our moral systems and\nethics will produce virtuous, noble, and holy men, as that our \u00e6sthetics\nwill produce poets, painters, and musicians.\nPhilosophy can never do more than interpret and explain what is given. It\ncan only bring to distinct abstract knowledge of the reason the nature of\nthe world which in the concrete, that is, as feeling, expresses itself\ncomprehensibly to every one. This, however, it does in every possible\nreference and from every point of view. Now, as this attempt has been made\nfrom other points of view in the three preceding books with the generality\nthat is proper to philosophy, in this book the action of men will be\nconsidered in the same way; and this side of the world might, indeed, be\nconsidered the most important of all, not only subjectively, as I remarked\nabove, but also objectively. In considering it I shall faithfully adhere\nto the method I have hitherto followed, and shall support myself by\npresupposing all that has already been advanced. There is, indeed, just\none thought which forms the content of this whole work. I have endeavoured\nto work it out in all other spheres, and I shall now do so with regard to\nhuman action. I shall then have done all that is in my power to\ncommunicate it as fully as possible.\nThe given point of view, and the method of treatment announced, are\nthemselves sufficient to indicate that in this ethical book no precepts,\nno doctrine of duty must be looked for; still less will a general moral\nprinciple be given, an universal receipt, as it were, for the production\nof all the virtues. Neither shall we talk of an \u201c_absolute ought_,\u201d for\nthis contains a contradiction, as is explained in the Appendix; nor yet of\na \u201c_law of freedom_,\u201d which is in the same position. In general, we shall\nnot speak at all of \u201cought,\u201d for this is how one speaks to children and to\nnations still in their childhood, but not to those who have appropriated\nall the culture of a full-grown age. It is a palpable contradiction to\ncall the will free, and yet to prescribe laws for it according to which it\nought to will. \u201cOught to will!\u201d\u2014wooden iron! But it follows from the point\nof view of our system that the will is not only free, but almighty. From\nit proceeds not only its action, but also its world; and as the will is,\nso does its action and its world become. Both are the self-knowledge of\nthe will and nothing more. The will determines itself, and at the same\ntime both its action and its world; for besides it there is nothing, and\nthese are the will itself. Only thus is the will truly autonomous, and\nfrom every other point of view it is heteronomous. Our philosophical\nendeavours can only extend to exhibiting and explaining the action of men\nin its inner nature and content, the various and even opposite maxims,\nwhose living expression it is. This we shall do in connection with the\npreceding portion of our work, and in precisely the same way as we have\nhitherto explained the other phenomena of the world, and have sought to\nbring their inmost nature to distinct abstract knowledge. Our philosophy\nwill maintain the same _immanency_ in the case of action, as in all that\nwe have hitherto considered. Notwithstanding Kant\u2019s great doctrine, it\nwill not attempt to use the forms of the phenomenon, the universal\nexpression of which is the principle of sufficient reason, as a\nleaping-pole to jump over the phenomenon itself, which alone gives meaning\nto these forms, and land in the boundless sphere of empty fictions. But\nthis actual world of experience, in which we are, and which is in us,\nremains both the material and the limits of our consideration: a world\nwhich is so rich in content that even the most searching investigation of\nwhich the human mind is capable could not exhaust it. Since then the real\nworld of experience will never fail to afford material and reality to our\nethical investigations, any more than to those we have already conducted,\nnothing will be less needful than to take refuge in negative conceptions\nvoid of content, and then somehow or other make even ourselves believe\nthat we are saying something when we speak with lifted eyebrows of\n\u201cabsolutes,\u201d \u201cinfinites,\u201d \u201csupersensibles,\u201d and whatever other mere\nnegations of this sort there may be (\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9, \u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1,\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bc\u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2\u2014_nihil est, nisi negationis nomen, cum obscura\nnotione_.\u2014Jul. or. 5), instead of which it would be shorter to say at once\ncloud-cuckoo-town (\u03bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03c5\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1): we shall not require to serve up\ncovered empty dishes of this kind. Finally, we shall not in this book, any\nmore than in those which have preceded it, narrate histories and give them\nout as philosophy. For we are of opinion that whoever supposes that the\ninner nature of the world can in any way, however plausibly disguised, be\n_historically_ comprehended, is infinitely far from a philosophical\nknowledge of the world. Yet this is what is supposed whenever a\n\u201cbecoming,\u201d or a \u201chaving become,\u201d or an \u201cabout to become\u201d enters into a\ntheory of the nature of the world, whenever an earlier or a later has the\nleast place in it; and in this way a beginning and an end of the world,\nand the path it pursues between them, is, either openly or disguisedly,\nboth sought for and found, and the individual who philosophises even\nrecognises his own position on that path. Such _historical philosophising_\nin most cases produces a cosmogony which admits of many varieties, or else\na system of emanations, a doctrine of successive disengagements from one\nbeing; or, finally, driven in despair from fruitless efforts upon these\npaths to the last path of all, it takes refuge in the converse doctrine of\na constant becoming, springing up, arising, coming to light out of\ndarkness, out of the hidden ground source or groundlessness, or whatever\nother nonsense of this sort there may be, which is most shortly disposed\nof with the remark that at the present moment a whole eternity, _i.e._, an\nendless time, has already passed, so that everything that can or ought to\nbecome must have already done so. For all such historical philosophy,\nwhatever airs it may give itself, regards _time_ just as if Kant had never\nlived, as a quality of the thing-in-itself, and thus stops at that which\nKant calls the phenomenon in opposition to the thing-in-itself; which\nPlato calls the becoming and never being, in opposition to the being and\nnever becoming; and which, finally, is called in the Indian philosophy the\nweb of M\u00e2ya. It is just the knowledge which belongs to the principle of\nsufficient reason, with which no one can penetrate to the inner nature of\nthings, but endlessly pursues phenomena, moving without end or aim, like a\nsquirrel in its wheel, till, tired out at last, he stops at some point or\nother arbitrarily chosen, and now desires to extort respect for it from\nothers also. The genuine philosophical consideration of the world, _i.e._,\nthe consideration that affords us a knowledge of its inner nature, and so\nleads us beyond the phenomenon, is precisely that method which does not\nconcern itself with the whence, the whither, and the why of the world, but\nalways and everywhere demands only the what; the method which considers\nthings not according to any relation, not as becoming and passing away, in\nshort, not according to one of the four forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason; but, on the contrary, just that which remains when all\nthat belongs to the form of knowledge proper to that principle has been\nabstracted, the inner nature of the world, which always appears unchanged\nin all the relations, but is itself never subject to them, and has the\nIdeas of the world as its object or material. From such knowledge as this\nproceeds philosophy, like art, and also, as we shall see in this book,\nthat disposition of mind which alone leads to true holiness and to\ndeliverance from the world.\n\u00a7 54. The first three books will, it is hoped, have conveyed the distinct\nand certain knowledge that the world as idea is the complete mirror of the\nwill, in which it knows itself in ascending grades of distinctness and\ncompleteness, the highest of which is man, whose nature, however, receives\nits complete expression only through the whole connected series of his\nactions. The self-conscious connection of these actions is made possible\nby reason, which enables a man constantly to survey the whole in the\nabstract.\nThe will, which, considered purely in itself, is without knowledge, and is\nmerely a blind incessant impulse, as we see it appear in unorganised and\nvegetable nature and their laws, and also in the vegetative part of our\nown life, receives through the addition of the world as idea, which is\ndeveloped in subjection to it, the knowledge of its own willing and of\nwhat it is that it wills. And this is nothing else than the world as idea,\nlife, precisely as it exists. Therefore we called the phenomenal world the\nmirror of the will, its objectivity. And since what the will wills is\nalways life, just because life is nothing but the representation of that\nwilling for the idea, it is all one and a mere pleonism if, instead of\nsimply saying \u201cthe will,\u201d we say \u201cthe will to live.\u201d\nWill is the thing-in-itself, the inner content, the essence of the world.\nLife, the visible world, the phenomenon, is only the mirror of the will.\nTherefore life accompanies the will as inseparably as the shadow\naccompanies the body; and if will exists, so will life, the world, exist.\nLife is, therefore, assured to the will to live; and so long as we are\nfilled with the will to live we need have no fear for our existence, even\nin the presence of death. It is true we see the individual come into being\nand pass away; but the individual is only phenomenal, exists only for the\nknowledge which is bound to the principle of sufficient reason, to the\n_principio individuationis_. Certainly, for this kind of knowledge, the\nindividual receives his life as a gift, rises out of nothing, then suffers\nthe loss of this gift through death, and returns again to nothing. But we\ndesire to consider life philosophically, _i.e._, according to its Ideas,\nand in this sphere we shall find that neither the will, the\nthing-in-itself in all phenomena, nor the subject of knowing, that which\nperceives all phenomena, is affected at all by birth or by death. Birth\nand death belong merely to the phenomenon of will, thus to life; and it is\nessential to this to exhibit itself in individuals which come into being\nand pass away, as fleeting phenomena appearing in the form of\ntime\u2014phenomena of that which in itself knows no time, but must exhibit\nitself precisely in the way we have said, in order to objectify its\npeculiar nature. Birth and death belong in like manner to life, and hold\nthe balance as reciprocal conditions of each other, or, if one likes the\nexpression, as poles of the whole phenomenon of life. The wisest of all\nmythologies, the Indian, expresses this by giving to the very god that\nsymbolises destruction, death (as Brahma, the most sinful and the lowest\ngod of the Trimurti, symbolises generation, coming into being, and Vishnu\nmaintaining or preserving), by giving, I say, to Siva as an attribute not\nonly the necklace of skulls, but also the lingam, the symbol of\ngeneration, which appears here as the counterpart of death, thus\nsignifying that generation and death are essentially correlatives, which\nreciprocally neutralise and annul each other. It was precisely the same\nsentiment that led the Greeks and Romans to adorn their costly sarcophagi,\njust as we see them now, with feasts, dances, marriages, the chase, fights\nof wild beasts, bacchanalians, &c.; thus with representations of the full\nardour of life, which they place before us not only in such revels and\nsports, but also in sensual groups, and even go so far as to represent the\nsexual intercourse of satyrs and goats. Clearly the aim was to point in\nthe most impressive manner away from the death of the mourned individual\nto the immortal life of nature, and thus to indicate, though without\nabstract knowledge, that the whole of nature is the phenomenon and also\nthe fulfilment of the will to live. The form of this phenomenon is time,\nspace, and causality, and by means of these individuation, which carries\nwith it that the individual must come into being and pass away. But this\nno more affects the will to live, of whose manifestation the individual\nis, as it were, only a particular example or specimen, than the death of\nan individual injures the whole of nature. For it is not the individual,\nbut only the species that Nature cares for, and for the preservation of\nwhich she so earnestly strives, providing for it with the utmost\nprodigality through the vast surplus of the seed and the great strength of\nthe fructifying impulse. The individual, on the contrary, neither has nor\ncan have any value for Nature, for her kingdom is infinite time and\ninfinite space, and in these infinite multiplicity of possible\nindividuals. Therefore she is always ready to let the individual fall, and\nhence it is not only exposed to destruction in a thousand ways by the most\ninsignificant accident, but originally destined for it, and conducted\ntowards it by Nature herself from the moment it has served its end of\nmaintaining the species. Thus Nature na\u00efvely expresses the great truth\nthat only the Ideas, not the individuals, have, properly speaking,\nreality, _i.e._, are complete objectivity of the will. Now, since man is\nNature itself, and indeed Nature at the highest grade of its\nself-consciousness, but Nature is only the objectified will to live, the\nman who has comprehended and retained this point of view may well console\nhimself, when contemplating his own death and that of his friends, by\nturning his eyes to the immortal life of Nature, which he himself is. This\nis the significance of Siva with the lingam, and of those ancient\nsarcophagi with their pictures of glowing life, which say to the mourning\nbeholder, _Natura non contristatur_.\nThat generation and death are to be regarded as something belonging to\nlife, and essential to this phenomenon of the will, arises also from the\nfact that they both exhibit themselves merely as higher powers of the\nexpression of that in which all the rest of life consists. This is through\nand through nothing else than the constant change of matter in the fixed\npermanence of form; and this is what constitutes the transitoriness of the\nindividual and the permanence of the species. Constant nourishment and\nrenewal differ from generation only in degree, and constant excretion\ndiffers only in degree from death. The first shows itself most simply and\ndistinctly in the plant. The plant is throughout a constant recurrence of\nthe same impulse of its simplest fibre, which groups itself into leaf and\nbranch. It is a systematic aggregate of similar plants supporting each\nother, whose constant reproduction is its single impulse. It ascends to\nthe full satisfaction of this tendency through the grades of its\nmetamorphosis, finally to the blossom and fruit, that compendium of its\nexistence and effort in which it now attains, by a short way, to that\nwhich is its single aim, and at a stroke produces a thousand-fold what, up\ntill then, it effected only in the particular case\u2014the repetition of\nitself. Its earlier growth and development stands in the same relation to\nits fruit as writing stands to printing. With the animal it is clearly\nquite the same. The process of nourishing is a constant reproduction; the\nprocess of reproduction is a higher power of nourishing. The pleasure\nwhich accompanies the act of procreation is a higher power of the\nagreeableness of the sense of life. On the other hand, excretion, the\nconstant exhalation and throwing off of matter, is the same as that which,\nat a higher power, death, is the contrary of generation. And if here we\nare always content to retain the form without lamenting the discarded\nmatter, we ought to bear ourselves in the same way if in death the same\nthing happens, in a higher degree and to the whole, as takes place daily\nand hourly in a partial manner in excretion: if we are indifferent to the\none, we ought not to shrink from the other. Therefore, from this point of\nview, it appears just as perverse to desire the continuance of an\nindividuality which will be replaced by other individuals as to desire the\npermanence of matter which will be replaced by other matter. It appears\njust as foolish to embalm the body as it would be carefully to preserve\nits excrement. As to the individual consciousness which is bound to the\nindividual body, it is absolutely interrupted every day by sleep. Deep\nsleep is, while it lasts, in no way different from death, into which, in\nfact, it often passes continuously, as in the case of freezing to death.\nIt differs only with regard to the future, the awaking. Death is a sleep\nin which individuality is forgotten; everything else wakes again, or\nrather never slept.(64)\nAbove all things, we must distinctly recognise that the form of the\nphenomenon of will, the form of life or reality, is really only the\n_present_, not the future nor the past. The latter are only in the\nconception, exist only in the connection of knowledge, so far as it\nfollows the principle of sufficient reason. No man has ever lived in the\npast, and none will live in the future; the _present_ alone is the form of\nall life, and is its sure possession which can never be taken from it. The\npresent always exists, together with its content. Both remain fixed\nwithout wavering, like the rainbow on the waterfall. For life is firm and\ncertain in the will, and the present is firm and certain in life.\nCertainly, if we reflect on the thousands of years that are past, of the\nmillions of men who lived in them, we ask, What were they? what has become\nof them? But, on the other hand, we need only recall our own past life and\nrenew its scenes vividly in our imagination, and then ask again, What was\nall this? what has become of it? As it is with it, so is it with the life\nof those millions. Or should we suppose that the past could receive a new\nexistence because it has been sealed by death? Our own past, the most\nrecent part of it, and even yesterday, is now no more than an empty dream\nof the fancy, and such is the past of all those millions. What was? What\nis? The will, of which life is the mirror, and knowledge free from will,\nwhich beholds it clearly in that mirror. Whoever has not yet recognised\nthis, or will not recognise it, must add to the question asked above as to\nthe fate of past generations of men this question also: Why he, the\nquestioner, is so fortunate as to be conscious of this costly, fleeting,\nand only real present, while those hundreds of generations of men, even\nthe heroes and philosophers of those ages, have sunk into the night of the\npast, and have thus become nothing; but he, his insignificant ego,\nactually exists? or more shortly, though somewhat strangely: Why this now,\nhis now, _is_ just now and _was_ not long ago? Since he asks such strange\nquestions, he regards his existence and his time as independent of each\nother, and the former as projected into the latter. He assumes indeed two\nnows\u2014one which belongs to the object, the other which belongs to the\nsubject, and marvels at the happy accident of their coincidence. But in\ntruth, only the point of contact of the object, the form of which is time,\nwith the subject, which has no mode of the principle of sufficient reason\nas its form, constitutes the present, as is shown in the essay on the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Now all object is the will so far as it\nhas become idea, and the subject is the necessary correlative of the\nobject. But real objects are only in the present; the past and the future\ncontain only conceptions and fancies, therefore the present is the\nessential form of the phenomenon of the will, and inseparable from it. The\npresent alone is that which always exists and remains immovable. That\nwhich, empirically apprehended, is the most transitory of all, presents\nitself to the metaphysical vision, which sees beyond the forms of\nempirical perception, as that which alone endures, the _nunc stans_ of the\nschoolmen. The source and the supporter of its content is the will to live\nor the thing-in-itself,\u2014which we are. That which constantly becomes and\npasses away, in that it has either already been or is still to be, belongs\nto the phenomenon as such on account of its forms, which make coming into\nbeing and passing away possible. Accordingly, we must think:\u2014_Quid\nfuit?_\u2014_Quod est._ _Quid erit?_\u2014_Quod fuit;_ and take it in the strict\nmeaning of the words; thus understand not _simile_ but _idem_. For life is\ncertain to the will, and the present is certain to life. Thus it is that\nevery one can say, \u201cI am once for all lord of the present, and through all\neternity it will accompany me as my shadow: therefore I do not wonder\nwhere it has come from, and how it happens that it is exactly now.\u201d We\nmight compare time to a constantly revolving sphere; the half that was\nalways sinking would be the past, that which was always rising would be\nthe future; but the indivisible point at the top, where the tangent\ntouches, would be the extensionless present. As the tangent does not\nrevolve with the sphere, neither does the present, the point of contact of\nthe object, the form of which is time, with the subject, which has no\nform, because it does not belong to the knowable, but is the condition of\nall that is knowable. Or, time is like an unceasing stream, and the\npresent a rock on which the stream breaks itself, but does not carry away\nwith it. The will, as thing-in-itself, is just as little subordinate to\nthe principle of sufficient reason as the subject of knowledge, which,\nfinally, in a certain regard is the will itself or its expression. And as\nlife, its own phenomenon, is assured to the will, so is the present, the\nsingle form of real life. Therefore we have not to investigate the past\nbefore life, nor the future after death: we have rather to know the\n_present_, the one form in which the will manifests itself.(65) It will\nnot escape from the will, but neither will the will escape from it. If,\ntherefore, life as it is satisfies, whoever affirms it in every way may\nregard it with confidence as endless, and banish the fear of death as an\nillusion that inspires him with the foolish dread that he can ever be\nrobbed of the present, and foreshadows a time in which there is no\npresent; an illusion with regard to time analogous to the illusion with\nregard to space through which every one imagines the position on the globe\nhe happens to occupy as above, and all other places as below. In the same\nway every one links the present to his own individuality, and imagines\nthat all present is extinguished with it; that then past and future might\nbe without a present. But as on the surface of the globe every place is\nabove, so the form of all life is the _present_, and to fear death because\nit robs us of the present, is just as foolish as to fear that we may slip\ndown from the round globe upon which we have now the good fortune to\noccupy the upper surface. The present is the form essential to the\nobjectification of the will. It cuts time, which extends infinitely in\nboth directions, as a mathematical point, and stands immovably fixed, like\nan everlasting mid-day with no cool evening, as the actual sun burns\nwithout intermission, while it only seems to sink into the bosom of night.\nTherefore, if a man fears death as his annihilation, it is just as if he\nwere to think that the sun cries out at evening, \u201cWoe is me! for I go down\ninto eternal night.\u201d(66) And conversely, whoever is oppressed with the\nburden of life, whoever desires life and affirms it, but abhors its\ntorments, and especially can no longer endure the hard lot that has fallen\nto himself, such a man has no deliverance to hope for from death, and\ncannot right himself by suicide. The cool shades of Orcus allure him only\nwith the false appearance of a haven of rest. The earth rolls from day\ninto night, the individual dies, but the sun itself shines without\nintermission, an eternal noon. Life is assured to the will to live; the\nform of life is an endless present, no matter how the individuals, the\nphenomena of the Idea, arise and pass away in time, like fleeting dreams.\nThus even already suicide appears to us as a vain and therefore a foolish\naction; when we have carried our investigation further it will appear to\nus in a still less favourable light.\nDogmas change and our knowledge is deceptive; but Nature never errs, her\nprocedure is sure, and she never conceals it. Everything is entirely in\nNature, and Nature is entire in everything. She has her centre in every\nbrute. It has surely found its way into existence, and it will surely find\nits way out of it. In the meantime it lives, fearless and without care, in\nthe presence of annihilation, supported by the consciousness that it is\nNature herself, and imperishable as she is. Man alone carries about with\nhim, in abstract conceptions, the certainty of his death; yet this can\nonly trouble him very rarely, when for a single moment some occasion calls\nit up to his imagination. Against the mighty voice of Nature reflection\ncan do little. In man, as in the brute which does not think, the certainty\nthat springs from his inmost consciousness that he himself is Nature, the\nworld, predominates as a lasting frame of mind; and on account of this no\nman is observably disturbed by the thought of certain and never-distant\ndeath, but lives as if he would live for ever. Indeed this is carried so\nfar that we may say that no one has really a lively conviction of the\ncertainty of his death, otherwise there would be no great difference\nbetween his frame of mind and that of a condemned criminal. Every one\nrecognises that certainty in the abstract and theoretically, but lays it\naside like other theoretical truths which are not applicable to practice,\nwithout really receiving it into his living consciousness. Whoever\ncarefully considers this peculiarity of human character will see that the\npsychological explanations of it, from habit and acquiescence in the\ninevitable, are by no means sufficient, and that its true explanation lies\nin the deeper ground we have given. The same fact explains the\ncircumstance that at all times and among all peoples dogmas of some kind\nor other relating to the continued existence of the individual after death\narise, and are believed in, although the evidence in support of them must\nalways be very insufficient, and the evidence against them forcible and\nvaried. But, in truth, this really requires no proof, but is recognised by\nthe healthy understanding as a fact, and confirmed by the confidence that\nNature never lies any more than she errs, but openly exhibits and na\u00efvely\nexpresses her action and her nature, while only we ourselves obscure it by\nour folly, in order to establish what is agreeable to our limited point of\nview.\nBut this that we have brought to clearest consciousness, that although the\nparticular phenomenon of the will has a temporal beginning and end, the\nwill itself as thing-in-itself is not affected by it, nor yet the\ncorrelative of all object, the knowing but never known subject, and that\nlife is always assured to the will to live\u2014this is not to be numbered with\nthe doctrines of immortality. For permanence has no more to do with the\nwill or with the pure subject of knowing, the eternal eye of the world,\nthan transitoriness, for both are predicates that are only valid in time,\nand the will and the pure subject of knowing lie outside time. Therefore\nthe egoism of the individual (this particular phenomenon of will\nenlightened by the subject of knowing) can extract as little nourishment\nand consolation for his wish to endure through endless time from the view\nwe have expressed, as he could from the knowledge that after his death the\nrest of the eternal world would continue to exist, which is just the\nexpression of the same view considered objectively, and therefore\ntemporally. For every individual is transitory only as phenomenon, but as\nthing-in-itself is timeless, and therefore endless. But it is also only as\nphenomenon that an individual is distinguished from the other things of\nthe world; as thing-in-itself he is the will which appears in all, and\ndeath destroys the illusion which separates his consciousness from that of\nthe rest: this is immortality. His exemption from death, which belongs to\nhim only as thing-in-itself, is for the phenomenon one with the\nimmortality of the rest of the external world.(67) Hence also, it arises\nthat although the inward and merely felt consciousness of that which we\nhave raised to distinct knowledge is indeed, as we have said, sufficient\nto prevent the thought of death from poisoning the life of the rational\nbeing, because this consciousness is the basis of that love of life which\nmaintains everything living, and enables it to live on at ease as if there\nwere no such thing as death, so long as it is face to face with life, and\nturns its attention to it, yet it will not prevent the individual from\nbeing seized with the fear of death, and trying in every way to escape\nfrom it, when it presents itself to him in some particular real case, or\neven only in his imagination, and he is compelled to contemplate it. For\njust as, so long as his knowledge was directed to life as such, he was\nobliged to recognise immortality in it, so when death is brought before\nhis eyes, he is obliged to recognise it as that which it is, the temporal\nend of the particular temporal phenomenon. What we fear in death is by no\nmeans the pain, for it lies clearly on this side of death, and, moreover,\nwe often take refuge in death from pain, just as, on the contrary, we\nsometimes endure the most fearful suffering merely to escape death for a\nwhile, although it would be quick and easy. Thus we distinguish pain and\ndeath as two entirely different evils. What we fear in death is the end of\nthe individual, which it openly professes itself to be, and since the\nindividual is a particular objectification of the will to live itself, its\nwhole nature struggles against death. Now when feeling thus exposes us\nhelpless, reason can yet step in and for the most part overcome its\nadverse influence, for it places us upon a higher standpoint, from which\nwe no longer contemplate the particular but the whole. Therefore a\nphilosophical knowledge of the nature of the world, which extended to the\npoint we have now reached in this work but went no farther, could even at\nthis point of view overcome the terror of death in the measure in which\nreflection had power over direct feeling in the given individual. A man\nwho had thoroughly assimilated the truths we have already advanced, but\nhad not come to know, either from his own experience or from a deeper\ninsight, that constant suffering is essential to life, who found\nsatisfaction and all that he wished in life, and could calmly and\ndeliberately desire that his life, as he had hitherto known it, should\nendure for ever or repeat itself ever anew, and whose love of life was so\ngreat that he willingly and gladly accepted all the hardships and miseries\nto which it is exposed for the sake of its pleasures,\u2014such a man would\nstand \u201cwith firm-knit bones on the well-rounded, enduring earth,\u201d and\nwould have nothing to fear. Armed with the knowledge we have given him, he\nwould await with indifference the death that hastens towards him on the\nwings of time. He would regard it as a false illusion, an impotent\nspectre, which frightens the weak but has no power over him who knows that\nhe is himself the will of which the whole world is the objectification or\ncopy, and that therefore he is always certain of life, and also of the\npresent, the peculiar and only form of the phenomenon of the will. He\ncould not be terrified by an endless past or future in which he would not\nbe, for this he would regard as the empty delusion of the web of M\u00e2ya.\nThus he would no more fear death than the sun fears the night. In the\n\u201cBhagavad-Gita\u201d Krishna thus raises the mind of his young pupil Arjuna,\nwhen, seized with compunction at the sight of the arrayed hosts (somewhat\nas Xerxes was), he loses heart and desires to give up the battle in order\nto avert the death of so many thousands. Krishna leads him to this point\nof view, and the death of those thousands can no longer restrain him; he\ngives the sign for battle. This point of view is also expressed by\nGoethe\u2019s Prometheus, especially when he says\u2014\n\u201cHere sit I, form mankind\nIn my own image,\nA race like to myself,\nTo suffer and to weep,\nRejoice, enjoy,\nAnd heed thee not,\nAs I.\u201d\nThe philosophy of Bruno and that of Spinoza might also lead any one to\nthis point of view whose conviction was not shaken and weakened by their\nerrors and imperfections. That of Bruno has properly no ethical theory at\nall, and the theory contained in the philosophy of Spinoza does not really\nproceed from the inner nature of his doctrine, but is merely tacked on to\nit by means of weak and palpable sophisms, though in itself it is\npraiseworthy and beautiful. Finally, there are many men who would occupy\nthis point of view if their knowledge kept pace with their will, _i.e._,\nif, free from all illusion, they were in a position to become clearly and\ndistinctly themselves. For this is, for knowledge, the point of view of\nthe complete _assertion of the will to live_.\nThat the will asserts itself means, that while in its objectivity, _i.e._,\nin the world and life, its own nature is completely and distinctly given\nit as idea, this knowledge does not by any means check its volition; but\nthis very life, so known, is willed as such by the will with knowledge,\nconsciously and deliberately, just as up to this point it willed it as\nblind effort without knowledge. The opposite of this, the _denial of the\nwill to live_, shows itself if, when that knowledge is attained, volition\nends, because the particular known phenomena no longer act as _motives_\nfor willing, but the whole knowledge of the nature of the world, the\nmirror of the will, which has grown up through the comprehension of the\n_Ideas_, becomes a _quieter_ of the will; and thus free, the will\nsuppresses itself. These quite unfamiliar conceptions are difficult to\nunderstand when expressed in this general way, but it is hoped they will\nbecome clear through the exposition we shall give presently, with special\nreference to action, of the phenomena in which, on the one hand, the\nassertion in its different grades, and, on the other hand, the denial,\nexpresses itself. For both proceed from knowledge, yet not from abstract\nknowledge, which is expressed in words, but from living knowledge, which\nis expressed in action and behaviour alone, and is independent of the\ndogmas which at the same time occupy the reason as abstract knowledge. To\nexhibit them both, and bring them to distinct knowledge of the reason, can\nalone be my aim, and not to prescribe or recommend the one or the other,\nwhich would be as foolish as it would be useless; for the will in itself\nis absolutely free and entirely self-determining, and for it there is no\nlaw. But before we go on to the exposition referred to, we must first\nexplain and more exactly define this _freedom_ and its relation to\nnecessity. And also, with regard to the life, the assertion and denial of\nwhich is our problem, we must insert a few general remarks connected with\nthe will and its objects. Through all this we shall facilitate the\napprehension of the inmost nature of the knowledge we are aiming at, of\nthe ethical significance of methods of action.\nSince, as has been said, this whole work is only the unfolding of a single\nthought, it follows that all its parts have the most intimate connection\nwith each other. Not merely that each part stands in a necessary relation\nto what immediately precedes it, and only presupposes a recollection of\nthat by the reader, as is the case with all philosophies which consist\nmerely of a series of inferences, but that every part of the whole work is\nrelated to every other part and presupposes it. It is, therefore,\nnecessary that the reader should remember not only what has just been\nsaid, but all the earlier parts of the work, so that he may be able to\nconnect them with what he is reading, however much may have intervened.\nPlato also makes this demand upon his readers through the intricate\ndigressions of his dialogues, in which he only returns to the leading\nthought after long episodes, which illustrate and explain it. In our case\nthis demand is necessary; for the breaking up of our one single thought\ninto its many aspects is indeed the only means of imparting it, though not\nessential to the thought itself, but merely an artificial form. The\ndivision of four principal points of view into four books, and the most\ncareful bringing together of all that is related and homogeneous, assists\nthe exposition and its comprehension; yet the material absolutely does not\nadmit of an advance in a straight line, such as the progress of history,\nbut necessitates a more complicated exposition. This again makes a\nrepeated study of the book necessary, for thus alone does the connection\nof all the parts with each other become distinct, and only then do they\nall mutually throw light upon each other and become quite clear.(68)\n\u00a7 55. That the will as such is _free_, follows from the fact that,\naccording to our view, it is the thing-in-itself, the content of all\nphenomena. The phenomena, on the other hand, we recognise as absolutely\nsubordinate to the principle of sufficient reason in its four forms. And\nsince we know that necessity is throughout identical with following from\ngiven grounds, and that these are convertible conceptions, all that\nbelongs to the phenomenon, _i.e._, all that is object for the knowing\nsubject as individual, is in one aspect reason, and in another aspect\nconsequent; and in this last capacity is determined with absolute\nnecessity, and can, therefore, in no respect be other than it is. The\nwhole content of Nature, the collective sum of its phenomena, is thus\nthroughout necessary, and the necessity of every part, of every\nphenomenon, of every event, can always be proved, because it must be\npossible to find the reason from which it follows as a consequent. This\nadmits of no exception: it follows from the unrestricted validity of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. In another aspect, however, the same world\nis for us, in all its phenomena, objectivity of will. And the will, since\nit is not phenomenon, is not idea or object, but thing-in-itself, and is\nnot subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason, the form of all\nobject; thus is not determined as a consequent through any reason, knows\nno necessity, _i.e._, is _free_. The concept of freedom is thus properly a\nnegative concept, for its content is merely the denial of necessity,\n_i.e._, the relation of consequent to its reason, according to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Now here lies before us in its most\ndistinct form the solution of that great contradiction, the union of\nfreedom with necessity, which has so often been discussed in recent times,\nyet, so far as I know, never clearly and adequately. Everything is as\nphenomenon, as object, absolutely necessary: _in itself_ it is will, which\nis perfectly free to all eternity. The phenomenon, the object, is\nnecessarily and unalterably determined in that chain of causes and effects\nwhich admits of no interruption. But the existence in general of this\nobject, and its specific nature, _i.e._, the Idea which reveals itself in\nit, or, in other words, its character, is a direct manifestation of will.\nThus, in conformity with the freedom of this will, the object might not be\nat all, or it might be originally and essentially something quite\ndifferent from what it is, in which case, however, the whole chain of\nwhich it is a link, and which is itself a manifestation of the same will,\nwould be quite different also. But once there and existing, it has entered\nthe chain of causes and effects, is always necessarily determined in it,\nand can, therefore, neither become something else, _i.e._, change itself,\nnor yet escape from the chain, _i.e._, vanish. Man, like every other part\nof Nature, is objectivity of the will; therefore all that has been said\nholds good of him. As everything in Nature has its forces and qualities,\nwhich react in a definite way when definitely affected, and constitute its\ncharacter, man also has his _character_, from which the motives call forth\nhis actions with necessity. In this manner of conduct his empirical\ncharacter reveals itself, but in this again his intelligible character,\nthe will in itself, whose determined phenomenon he is. But man is the most\ncomplete phenomenon of will, and, as we explained in the Second Book, he\nhad to be enlightened with so high a degree of knowledge in order to\nmaintain himself in existence, that in it a perfectly adequate copy or\nrepetition of the nature of the world under the form of the idea became\npossible: this is the comprehension of the Ideas, the pure mirror of the\nworld, as we learnt in the Third Book. Thus in man the will can attain to\nfull self-consciousness, to distinct and exhaustive knowledge of its own\nnature, as it mirrors itself in the whole world. We saw in the preceding\nbook that art springs from the actual presence of this degree of\nknowledge; and at the end of our whole work it will further appear that,\nthrough the same knowledge, in that the will relates it to itself, a\nsuppression and self-denial of the will in its most perfect manifestation\nis possible. So that the freedom which otherwise, as belonging to the\nthing-in-itself, can never show itself in the phenomenon, in such a case\ndoes also appear in it, and, by abolishing the nature which lies at the\nfoundation of the phenomenon, while the latter itself still continues to\nexist in time, it brings about a contradiction of the phenomenon with\nitself, and in this way exhibits the phenomena of holiness and\nself-renunciation. But all this can only be fully understood at the end of\nthis book. What has just been said merely affords a preliminary and\ngeneral indication of how man is distinguished from all the other\nphenomena of will by the fact that freedom, _i.e._, independence of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, which only belongs to the will as\nthing-in-itself, and contradicts the phenomenon, may yet possibly, in his\ncase, appear in the phenomenon also, where, however, it necessarily\nexhibits itself as a contradiction of the phenomenon with itself. In this\nsense, not only the will in itself, but man also may certainly be called\nfree, and thus distinguished from all other beings. But how this is to be\nunderstood can only become clear through all that is to follow, and for\nthe present we must turn away from it altogether. For, in the first place,\nwe must beware of the error that the action of the individual definite man\nis subject to no necessity, _i.e._, that the power of the motive is less\ncertain than the power of the cause, or the following of the conclusion\nfrom the premises. The freedom of the will as thing-in-itself, if, as has\nbeen said, we abstract from the entirely exceptional case mentioned above,\nby no means extends directly to its phenomenon, not even in the case in\nwhich this reaches the highest made of its visibility, and thus does not\nextend to the rational animal endowed with individual character, _i.e._,\nthe person. The person is never free although he is the phenomenon of a\nfree will; for he is already the determined phenomenon of the free\nvolition of this will, and, because he enters the form of every object,\nthe principle of sufficient reason, he develops indeed the unity of that\nwill in a multiplicity of actions, but on account of the timeless unity of\nthat volition in itself, this multiplicity exhibits in itself the regular\nconformity to law of a force of Nature. Since, however, it is that free\nvolition that becomes visible in the person and the whole of his conduct,\nrelating itself to him as the concept to the definition, every individual\naction of the person is to be ascribed to the free will, and directly\nproclaims itself as such in consciousness. Therefore, as was said in the\nSecond Book, every one regards himself _a priori_ (_i.e._, here in this\noriginal feeling) as free in his individual actions, in the sense that in\nevery given case every action is possible for him, and he only recognises\n_a posteriori_ from experience and reflection upon experience that his\nactions take place with absolute necessity from the coincidence of his\ncharacter with his motives. Hence it arises that every uncultured man,\nfollowing his feeling, ardently defends complete freedom in particular\nactions, while the great thinkers of all ages, and indeed the more\nprofound systems of religion, have denied it. But whoever has come to see\nclearly that the whole nature of man is will, and he himself only a\nphenomenon of this will, and that such a phenomenon has, even from the\nsubject itself, the principle of sufficient reason as its necessary form,\nwhich here appears as the law of motivation,\u2014such a man will regard it as\njust as absurd to doubt the inevitable nature of an action when the motive\nis presented to a given character, as to doubt that the three angles of\nany triangle are together equal to two right angles. Priestley has very\nsufficiently proved the necessity of the individual action in his\n\u201cDoctrine of Philosophical Necessity;\u201d but Kant, whose merit in this\nrespect is specially great, first proved the coexistence of this necessity\nwith the freedom of the will in itself, _i.e._, apart from the\nphenomenon,(69) by establishing the distinction between the intelligible\nand the empirical character. I entirely adhere to this distinction, for\nthe former is the will as thing-in-itself so far as it appears in a\ndefinite individual in a definite grade, and the latter is this phenomenon\nitself as it exhibits itself in time in the mode of action, and in space\nin the physical structure. In order to make the relation of the two\ncomprehensible, the best expression is that which I have already used in\nthe introductory essay, that the intelligible character of every man is to\nbe regarded as an act of will outside time, and therefore indivisible and\nunchangeable, and the manifestation of this act of will developed and\nbroken up in time and space and all the forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason is the empirical character as it exhibits itself for\nexperience in the whole conduct and life of this man. As the whole tree is\nonly the constantly repeated manifestation of one and the same tendency,\nwhich exhibits itself in its simplest form in the fibre, and recurs and is\neasily recognised in the construction of the leaf, shoot, branch, and\ntrunk, so all a man\u2019s deeds are merely the constantly repeated expression,\nsomewhat varied in form, of his intelligible character, and the induction\nbased on the sum of all these expressions gives us his empirical\ncharacter. For the rest, I shall not at this point repeat in my own words\nKant\u2019s masterly exposition, but presuppose it as known.\nIn the year 1840 I dealt with the important chapter on the freedom of the\nwill, thoroughly and in detail, in my crowned prize-essay upon the\nsubject, and exposed the reason of the delusion which led men to imagine\nthat they found an empirically given absolute freedom of the will, that is\nto say, a _liberum arbitrium indifferenti\u00e6_, as a fact in\nself-consciousness; for the question propounded for the essay was with\ngreat insight directed to this point. Therefore, as I refer the reader to\nthat work, and also to the tenth paragraph of the prize-essay on the basis\nof morals, which was published along with it under the title \u201cThe Two\nFundamental Problems of Ethics,\u201d I now omit the incomplete exposition of\nthe necessity of the act of will, which was given at this place in the\nfirst edition. Instead of it I shall explain the delusion mentioned above\nin a brief discussion which is presupposed in the nineteenth chapter of\nthe supplement to the present work, and therefore could not be given in\nthe prize-essay referred to.\nApart from the fact that the will as the true thing-in-itself is actually\noriginal and independent, and that the feeling of its originality and\nabsoluteness must accompany its acts in self-consciousness, though here\nthey are already determined, there arises the illusion of an empirical\nfreedom of the will (instead of the transcendental freedom which alone is\nto be attributed to it), and thus a freedom of its particular actions,\nfrom that attitude of the intellect towards the will which is explained,\nseparated, and subordinated in the nineteenth chapter of the supplement,\nespecially under No. 3. The intellect knows the conclusions of the will\nonly _a posteriori_ and empirically; therefore when a choice is presented,\nit has no data as to how the will is to decide. For the intelligible\ncharacter, by virtue of which, when motives are given, only _one_ decision\nis possible and is therefore necessary, does not come within the knowledge\nof the intellect, but merely the empirical character is known to it\nthrough the succession of its particular acts. Therefore it seems to the\nintellect that in a given case two opposite decisions are possible for the\nwill. But this is just the same thing as if we were to say of a\nperpendicular beam that has lost its balance, and is hesitating which way\nto fall, \u201cIt can fall either to the right hand or the left.\u201d This _can_\nhas merely a subjective significance, and really means \u201cas far as the data\nknown to us are concerned.\u201d Objectively, the direction of the fall is\nnecessarily determined as soon as the equilibrium is lost. Accordingly,\nthe decision of one\u2019s own will is undetermined only to the beholder, one\u2019s\nown intellect, and thus merely relatively and subjectively for the subject\nof knowing. In itself and objectively, on the other hand, in every choice\npresented to it, its decision is at once determined and necessary. But\nthis determination only comes into consciousness through the decision that\nfollows upon it. Indeed, we receive an empirical proof of this when any\ndifficult and important choice lies before us, but only under a condition\nwhich is not yet present, but merely hoped for, so that in the meanwhile\nwe can do nothing, but must remain passive. Now we consider how we shall\ndecide when the circumstances occur that will give us a free activity and\nchoice. Generally the foresight of rational deliberation recommends one\ndecision, while direct inclination leans rather to the other. So long as\nwe are compelled to remain passive, the side of reason seems to wish to\nkeep the upper hand; but we see beforehand how strongly the other side\nwill influence us when the opportunity for action arises. Till then we are\neagerly concerned to place the motives on both sides in the clearest\nlight, by calm meditation on the _pro et contra_, so that every motive may\nexert its full influence upon the will when the time arrives, and it may\nnot be misled by a mistake on the part of the intellect to decide\notherwise than it would have done if all the motives had their due\ninfluence upon it. But this distinct unfolding of the motives on both\nsides is all that the intellect can do to assist the choice. It awaits the\nreal decision just as passively and with the same intense curiosity as if\nit were that of a foreign will. Therefore from its point of view both\ndecisions must seem to it equally possible; and this is just the illusion\nof the empirical freedom of the will. Certainly the decision enters the\nsphere of the intellect altogether empirically, as the final conclusion of\nthe matter; but yet it proceeded from the inner nature, the intelligible\ncharacter, of the individual will in its conflict with given motives, and\ntherefore with complete necessity. The intellect can do nothing more than\nbring out clearly and fully the nature of the motives; it cannot determine\nthe will itself; for the will is quite inaccessible to it, and, as we have\nseen, cannot be investigated.\nIf, under the same circumstances, a man could act now one way and now\nanother, it would be necessary that his will itself should have changed in\nthe meantime, and thus that it should lie in time, for change is only\npossible in time; but then either the will would be a mere phenomenon, or\ntime would be a condition of the thing-in-itself. Accordingly the dispute\nas to the freedom of the particular action, the _liberum arbitrium\nindifferenti\u00e6_, really turns on the question whether the will lies in time\nor not. If, as both Kant\u2019s doctrine and the whole of my system\nnecessitates, the will is the thing-in-itself outside time and outside\nevery form of the principle of sufficient reason, not only must the\nindividual act in the same way in the same circumstances, and not only\nmust every bad action be the sure warrant of innumerable others, which the\nindividual _must_ perform and _cannot_ leave, but, as Kant said, if only\nthe empirical character and the motives were completely given, it would be\npossible to calculate the future conduct of a man just as we can calculate\nan eclipse of the sun or moon. As Nature is consistent, so is the\ncharacter; every action must take place in accordance with it, just as\nevery phenomenon takes place according to a law of Nature: the causes in\nthe latter case and the motives in the former are merely the occasional\ncauses, as was shown in the Second Book. The will, whose phenomenon is the\nwhole being and life of man, cannot deny itself in the particular case,\nand what the man wills on the whole, that will he also will in the\nparticular case.\nThe assertion of an empirical freedom of the will, a _liberum arbitrium\nindifferenti\u00e6_, agrees precisely with the doctrine that places the inner\nnature of man in a _soul_, which is originally a _knowing_, and indeed\nreally an abstract _thinking_ nature, and only in consequence of this a\n_willing_ nature\u2014a doctrine which thus regards the will as of a secondary\nor derivative nature, instead of knowledge which is really so. The will\nindeed came to be regarded as an act of thought, and to be identified with\nthe judgment, especially by Descartes and Spinoza. According to this\ndoctrine every man must become what he is only through his knowledge; he\nmust enter the world as a moral cipher come to know the things in it, and\nthereupon determine to be this or that, to act thus or thus, and may also\nthrough new knowledge achieve a new course of action, that is to say,\nbecome another person. Further, he must first know a thing to be _good_,\nand in consequence of this will it, instead of first _willing_ it, and in\nconsequence of this calling it _good_. According to my fundamental point\nof view, all this is a reversal of the true relation. Will is first and\noriginal; knowledge is merely added to it as an instrument belonging to\nthe phenomenon of will. Therefore every man is what he is through his\nwill, and his character is original, for willing is the basis of his\nnature. Through the knowledge which is added to it he comes to know in the\ncourse of experience _what he is_, _i.e._, he learns his character. Thus\nhe _knows_ himself in consequence of and in accordance with the nature of\nhis will, instead of _willing_ in consequence of and in accordance with\nhis knowing. According to the latter view, he would only require to\nconsider how he would like best to be, and he would be it; that is its\ndoctrine of the freedom of the will. Thus it consists really in this, that\na man is his own work guided by the light of knowledge. I, on the\ncontrary, say that he is his own work before all knowledge, and knowledge\nis merely added to it to enlighten it. Therefore he cannot resolve to be\nthis or that, nor can he become other than he is; but he _is_ once for\nall, and he knows in the course of experience _what_ he is. According to\none doctrine he _wills_ what he knows, and according to the other he\n_knows_ what he wills.\nThe Greeks called the character \u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, and its expression, _i.e._, morals,\n\u03b7\u03b8\u03b7. But this word comes from \u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, custom; they chose it in order to\nexpress metaphorically the constancy of character through the constancy of\ncustom. \u03a4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd. \u03b7\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\n\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03b8\u03b9\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 (_a voce_ \u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, _i.e._, _consuetudo_ \u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 _est\nappellatum: ethica ergo dicta est_ \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b8\u03b9\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, _sivi ab\nassuescendo_) says Aristotle (Eth.

In Christian theology we find\nthe dogma of predestination in consequence of election and non-election\n(Rom. ix. 11-24), clearly originating from the knowledge that man does not\nchange himself, but his life and conduct, _i.e._, his empirical character,\nis only the unfolding of his intelligible character, the development of\ndecided and unchangeable natural dispositions recognisable even in the\nchild; therefore, as it were, even at his birth his conduct is firmly\ndetermined, and remains essentially the same to the end. This we entirely\nagree with; but certainly the consequences which followed from the union\nof this perfectly correct insight with the dogmas that already existed in\nJewish theology, and which now gave rise to the great difficulty, the\nGordian knot upon which most of the controversies of the Church turned, I\ndo not undertake to defend, for even the Apostle Paul scarcely succeeded\nin doing so by means of his simile of the potter\u2019s vessels which he\ninvented for the purpose, for the result he finally arrived at was nothing\nelse than this:\u2014\n\u201cLet mankind\nFear the gods!\nThey hold the power\nIn everlasting hands:\nAnd they can use it\nAs seems good to them.\u201d\nSuch considerations, however, are really foreign to our subject. Some\nexplanation as to the relation between the character and the knowledge in\nwhich all its motives lie, will now be more to the point.\nThe motives which determine the manifestation of the character or conduct\ninfluence it through the medium of knowledge. But knowledge is changeable,\nand often vacillates between truth and error, yet, as a rule, is rectified\nmore and more in the course of life, though certainly in very different\ndegrees. Therefore the conduct of a man may be observably altered without\njustifying us in concluding that his character has been changed. What the\nman really and in general wills, the striving of his inmost nature, and\nthe end he pursues in accordance with it, this we can never change by\ninfluence upon him from without by instruction, otherwise we could\ntransform him. Seneca says admirably, _velle non discitur_; whereby he\npreferred truth to his Stoic philosophers, who taught \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd (_doceri posse virtutem_). From without the will can only be\naffected by motives. But these can never change the will itself; for they\nhave power over it only under the presupposition that it is precisely such\nas it is. All that they can do is thus to alter the direction of its\neffort, _i.e._, bring it about that it shall seek in another way than it\nhas hitherto done that which it invariably seeks. Therefore instruction,\nimproved knowledge, in other words, influence from without, may indeed\nteach the will that it erred in the means it employed, and can therefore\nbring it about that the end after which it strives once for all according\nto its inner nature shall be pursued on an entirely different path and in\nan entirely different object from what has hitherto been the case. But it\ncan never bring about that the will shall will something actually\ndifferent from what it has hitherto willed; this remains unchangeable, for\nthe will is simply this willing itself, which would have to be abolished.\nThe former, however, the possible modification of knowledge, and through\nknowledge of conduct, extends so far that the will seeks to attain its\nunalterable end, for example, Mohammed\u2019s paradise, at one time in the real\nworld, at another time in a world of imagination, adapting the means to\neach, and thus in the first case applying prudence, might, and fraud, and\nin the second case, abstinence, justice, alms, and pilgrimages to Mecca.\nBut its effort itself has not therefore changed, still less the will\nitself. Thus, although its action certainly shows itself very different at\ndifferent times, its willing has yet remained precisely the same. _Velle\nnon discitur._\nFor motives to act, it is necessary not only that they should be present,\nbut that they should be known; for, according to a very good expression of\nthe schoolmen, which we referred to once before, _causa finalis movet non\nsecundum suum esse reale; sed secundum esse cognitum_. For example, in\norder that the relation may appear that exists in a given man between\negoism and sympathy, it is not sufficient that he should possess wealth\nand see others in want, but he must also know what he can do with his\nwealth, both for himself and for others: not only must the suffering of\nothers be presented to him, but he must know both what suffering and also\nwhat pleasure is. Perhaps, on a first occasion, he did not know all this\nso well as on a second; and if, on a similar occasion, he acts\ndifferently, this arises simply from the fact that the circumstances were\nreally different, as regards the part of them that depends on his knowing\nthem, although they seem to be the same. As ignorance of actually existing\ncircumstances robs them of their influence, so, on the other hand,\nentirely imaginary circumstances may act as if they were real, not only in\nthe case of a particular deception, but also in general and continuously.\nFor example, if a man is firmly persuaded that every good action will be\nrepaid him a hundredfold in a future life, such a conviction affects him\nin precisely the same way as a good bill of exchange at a very long date,\nand he can give from mere egoism, as from another point of view he would\ntake from egoism. He has not changed himself: _velle non discitur._ It is\non account of this great influence of knowledge upon action, while the\nwill remains unchangeable, that the character develops and its different\nfeatures appear only little by little. Therefore it shows itself different\nat every period of life, and an impetuous, wild youth may be succeeded by\na staid, sober, manly age. Especially what is bad in the character will\nalways come out more strongly with time, yet sometimes it occurs that\npassions which a man gave way to in his youth are afterwards voluntarily\nrestrained, simply because the motives opposed to them have only then come\ninto knowledge. Hence, also, we are all innocent to begin with, and this\nmerely means that neither we nor others know the evil of our own nature;\nit only appears with the motives, and only in time do the motives appear\nin knowledge. Finally we come to know ourselves as quite different from\nwhat _a priori_ we supposed ourselves to be, and then we are often\nterrified at ourselves.\nRepentance never proceeds from a change of the will (which is impossible),\nbut from a change of knowledge. The essential and peculiar in what I have\nalways willed I must still continue to will; for I myself am this will\nwhich lies outside time and change. I can therefore never repent of what I\nhave willed, though I can repent of what I have done; because, led by\nfalse conceptions, I did something that was not in conformity with my\nwill. The discovery of this through fuller knowledge is _repentance_. This\nextends not merely to worldly wisdom, to the choice of the means, and the\njudgment of the appropriateness of the end to my own will, but also to\nwhat is properly ethical. For example, I may have acted more egotistically\nthan is in accordance with my character, led astray by exaggerated ideas\nof the need in which I myself stood, or of the craft, falseness, and\nwickedness of others, or because I hurried too much, _i.e._, acted without\ndeliberation, determined not by motives distinctly known _in abstracto_,\nbut by merely perceived motives, by the present and the emotion which it\nexcited, and which was so strong that I had not properly the use of my\nreason; but the return of reflection is thus here also merely corrected\nknowledge, and from this repentance may proceed, which always proclaims\nitself by making amends for the past, as far as is possible. Yet it must\nbe observed that, in order to deceive themselves, men prearrange what seem\nto be hasty errors, but are really secretly considered actions. For we\ndeceive and flatter no one through such fine devices as ourselves. The\nconverse of the case we have given may also occur. I may be misled by too\ngood an opinion of others, or want of knowledge of the relative value of\nthe good things of life, or some abstract dogma in which I have since lost\nfaith, and thus I may act less egotistically than is in keeping with my\ncharacter, and lay up for myself repentance of another kind. Thus\nrepentance is always corrected knowledge of the relation of an act to its\nspecial intention. When the will reveals its Ideas in space alone, _i.e._,\nthrough mere form, the matter in which other Ideas\u2014in this case natural\nforces\u2014already reign, resists the will, and seldom allows the form that is\nstriving after visibility to appear in perfect purity and distinctness,\n_i.e._, in perfect beauty. And there is an analogous hindrance to the will\nas it reveals itself in time alone, _i.e._, through actions, in the\nknowledge which seldom gives it the data quite correctly, so that the\naction which takes place does not accurately correspond to the will, and\nleads to repentance. Repentance thus always proceeds from corrected\nknowledge, not from the change of the will, which is impossible. Anguish\nof conscience for past deeds is anything but repentance. It is pain at the\nknowledge of oneself in one\u2019s inmost nature, _i.e._, as will. It rests\nprecisely on the certainty that we have still the same will. If the will\nwere changed, and therefore the anguish of conscience mere repentance, it\nwould cease to exist. The past could then no longer give us pain, for it\nexhibited the expressions of a will which is no longer that of him who has\nrepented. We shall explain the significance of anguish of conscience in\ndetail farther on.\nThe influence which knowledge, as the medium of motives, exerts, not\nindeed upon the will itself, but upon its appearance in actions, is also\nthe source of the principal distinction between the action of men and that\nof brutes, for their methods of knowledge are different. The brute has\nonly knowledge of perception, the man, through reason, has also abstract\nideas, conceptions. Now, although man and brute are with equal necessity\ndetermined by their motives, yet man, as distinguished from the brute, has\na complete _choice_, which has often been regarded as a freedom of the\nwill in particular actions, although it is nothing but the possibility of\na thoroughly-fought-out battle between several motives, the strongest of\nwhich then determines it with necessity. For this the motives must have\nassumed the form of abstract thoughts, because it is really only by means\nof these that deliberation, _i.e._, a weighing of opposite reasons for\naction, is possible. In the case of the brute there can only be a choice\nbetween perceptible motives presented to it, so that the choice is limited\nto the narrow sphere of its present sensuous perception. Therefore the\nnecessity of the determination of the will by the motive, which is like\nthat of the effect by the cause, can be exhibited perceptibly and directly\nonly in the case of the brutes, because here the spectator has the motives\njust as directly before his eyes as their effect; while in the case of man\nthe motives are almost always abstract ideas, which are not communicated\nto the spectator, and even for the actor himself the necessity of their\neffect is hidden behind their conflict. For only _in abstracto_ can\nseveral ideas, as judgments and chains of conclusions, lie beside each\nother in consciousness, and then, free from all determination of time,\nwork against each other till the stronger overcomes the rest and\ndetermines the will. This is the complete _choice_ or power of\ndeliberation which man has as distinguished from the brutes, and on\naccount of which freedom of the will has been attributed to him, in the\nbelief that his willing is a mere result of the operations of his\nintellect, without a definite tendency which serves as its basis; while,\nin truth, the motives only work on the foundation and under the\npresupposition of his definite tendency, which in his case is individual,\n_i.e._, a character. A fuller exposition of this power of deliberation,\nand the difference between human and brute choice which is introduced by\nit, will be found in the \u201cTwo Fundamental Problems of Ethics\u201d (1st\nedition, p. 35, _et seq._; 2d edition, p. 34, _et seq._), to which I\ntherefore refer. For the rest, this power of deliberation which man\npossesses is one of those things that makes his existence so much more\nmiserable than that of the brute. For in general our greatest sufferings\ndo not lie in the present as ideas of perception or as immediate feelings;\nbut in the reason, as abstract conceptions, painful thoughts, from which\nthe brute, which lives only in the present, and therefore in enviable\ncarelessness, is entirely free.\nIt seems to have been the dependence, which we have shown, of the human\npower of deliberation upon the faculty of abstract thinking, and thus also\nof judging and drawing conclusions also, that led both Descartes and\nSpinoza to identify the decisions of the will with the faculty of\nasserting and denying (the faculty of judgment). From this Descartes\ndeduced the doctrine that the will, which, according to him, is\nindifferently free, is the source of sin, and also of all theoretical\nerror. And Spinoza, on the other hand, concluded that the will is\nnecessarily determined by the motives, as the judgment is by the\nreasons.(70) The latter doctrine is in a sense true, but it appears as a\ntrue conclusion from false premises.\nThe distinction we have established between the ways in which the brutes\nand man are respectively moved by motives exerts a very wide influence\nupon the nature of both, and has most to do with the complete and obvious\ndifferences of their existence. While an idea of perception is in every\ncase the motive which determines the brute, the man strives to exclude\nthis kind of motivation altogether, and to determine himself entirely by\nabstract ideas. Thus he uses his prerogative of reason to the greatest\npossible advantage. Independent of the present, he neither chooses nor\navoids the passing pleasure or pain, but reflects on the consequences of\nboth. In most cases, setting aside quite insignificant actions, we are\ndetermined by abstract, thought motives, not present impressions.\nTherefore all particular privation for the moment is for us comparatively\nlight, but all renunciation is terribly hard; for the former only concerns\nthe fleeting present, but the latter concerns the future, and includes in\nitself innumerable privations, of which it is the equivalent. The causes\nof our pain, as of our pleasure, lie for the most part, not in the real\npresent, but merely in abstract thoughts. It is these which are often\nunbearable to us\u2014inflict torments in comparison with which all the\nsufferings of the animal world are very small; for even our own physical\npain is not felt at all when they are present. Indeed, in the case of keen\nmental suffering, we even inflict physical suffering on ourselves merely\nto distract our attention from the former to the latter. This is why, in\ngreat mental anguish, men tear their hair, beat their breasts, lacerate\ntheir faces, or roll on the floor, for all these are in reality only\nviolent means of diverting the mind from an unbearable thought. Just\nbecause mental pain, being much greater, makes us insensible to physical\npain, suicide is very easy to the person who is in despair, or who is\nconsumed by morbid depression, even though formerly, in comfortable\ncircumstances, he recoiled at the thought of it. In the same way care and\npassion (thus the play of thought) wear out the body oftener and more than\nphysical hardships. And in accordance with this Epictetus rightly says:\n\u03a4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03bf\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\n(_Perturbant homines non res ips\u00e6, sed de rebus decreta_) (V.); and\nSeneca: _Plura sunt qu\u00e6 nos terrent, quam qu\u00e6 premunt, et s\u00e6pius opinione\nquam re laboramus_ (Ep. 5). Eulenspiegel also admirably bantered human\nnature, for going uphill he laughed, and going downhill he wept. Indeed,\nchildren who have hurt themselves often cry, not at the pain, but at the\nthought of the pain which is awakened when some one condoles with them.\nSuch great differences in conduct and in life arise from the diversity\nbetween the methods of knowledge of the brutes and man. Further, the\nappearance of the distinct and decided individual character, the principal\ndistinction between man and the brute, which has scarcely more than the\ncharacter of the species, is conditioned by the choice between several\nmotives, which is only possible through abstract conceptions. For only\nafter a choice has been made are the resolutions, which vary in different\nindividuals, an indication of the individual character which is different\nin each; while the action of the brute depends only upon the presence or\nabsence of the impression, supposing this impression to be in general a\nmotive for its species. And, finally, in the case of man, only the\nresolve, and not the mere wish, is a valid indication of his character\nboth for himself and for others; but the resolve becomes for himself, as\nfor others, a certain fact only through the deed. The wish is merely the\nnecessary consequence of the present impression, whether of the outward\nstimulus, or the inward passing mood; and is therefore as immediately\nnecessary and devoid of consideration as the action of the brutes.\nTherefore, like the action of the brutes, it merely expresses the\ncharacter of the species, not that of the individual, _i.e._, it indicates\nmerely what _man in general_, not what the individual who experiences the\nwish, is capable of doing. The deed alone,\u2014because as human action it\nalways requires a certain deliberation, and because as a rule a man has\ncommand of his reason, is considerate, _i.e._, decides in accordance with\nconsidered and abstract motives,\u2014is the expression of the intelligible\nmaxims of his conduct, the result of his inmost willing, and is related as\na letter to the word that stands for his empirical character, itself\nmerely the temporal expression of his intelligible character. In a healthy\nmind, therefore, only deeds oppress the conscience, not wishes and\nthoughts; for it is only our deeds that hold up to us the mirror of our\nwill. The deed referred to above, that is entirely unconsidered and is\nreally committed in blind passion, is to a certain extent an intermediate\nthing between the mere wish and the resolve.\nTherefore, by true repentance, which, however, shows itself as action\nalso, it can be obliterated, as a falsely drawn line, from that picture of\nour will which our course of life is. I may insert the remark here, as a\nvery good comparison, that the relation between wish and deed has a purely\naccidental but accurate analogy with that between the accumulation and\ndischarge of electricity.\nAs the result of the whole of this discussion of the freedom of the will\nand what relates to it, we find that although the will may, in itself and\napart from the phenomenon, be called free and even omnipotent, yet in its\nparticular phenomena enlightened by knowledge, as in men and brutes, it is\ndetermined by motives to which the special character regularly and\nnecessarily responds, and always in the same way. We see that because of\nthe possession on his part of abstract or rational knowledge, man, as\ndistinguished from the brutes, has a _choice_, which only makes him the\nscene of the conflict of his motives, without withdrawing him from their\ncontrol. This choice is therefore certainly the condition of the\npossibility of the complete expression of the individual character, but is\nby no means to be regarded as freedom of the particular volition, _i.e._,\nindependence of the law of causality, the necessity of which extends to\nman as to every other phenomenon. Thus the difference between human\nvolition and that of the brutes, which is introduced by reason or\nknowledge through concepts, extends to the point we have indicated, and no\nfarther. But, what is quite a different thing, there may arise a\nphenomenon of the human will which is quite impossible in the brute\ncreation, if man altogether lays aside the knowledge of particular things\nas such which is subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason, and by\nmeans of his knowledge of the Ideas sees through the _principium\nindividuationis_. Then an actual appearance of the real freedom of the\nwill as a thing-in-itself is possible, by which the phenomenon comes into\na sort of contradiction with itself, as is indicated by the word\nself-renunciation; and, finally, the \u201cin-itself\u201d of its nature suppresses\nitself. But this, the one, real, and direct expression of the freedom of\nthe will in itself in the phenomenon, cannot be distinctly explained here,\nbut will form the subject of the concluding part of our work.\nNow that we have shown clearly in these pages the unalterable nature of\nthe empirical character, which is just the unfolding of the intelligible\ncharacter that lies outside time, together with the necessity with which\nactions follow upon its contact with motives, we hasten to anticipate an\nargument which may very easily be drawn from this in the interest of bad\ndispositions. Our character is to be regarded as the temporal unfolding of\nan extra-temporal, and therefore indivisible and unalterable, act of will,\nor an intelligible character. This necessarily determines all that is\nessential in our conduct in life, _i.e._, its ethical content, which must\nexpress itself in accordance with it in its phenomenal appearance, the\nempirical character; while only what is unessential in this, the outward\nform of our course of life, depends upon the forms in which the motives\npresent themselves. It might, therefore, be inferred that it is a waste of\ntrouble to endeavour to improve one\u2019s character, and that it is wiser to\nsubmit to the inevitable, and gratify every inclination at once, even if\nit is bad. But this is precisely the same thing as the theory of an\ninevitable fate which is called \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, and in more recent times\nTurkish faith. Its true refutation, as it is supposed to have been given\nby Chrysippus, is explained by Cicero in his book _De Fato_, ch. 12, 13.\nThough everything may be regarded as irrevocably predetermined by fate,\nyet it is so only through the medium of the chain of causes; therefore in\nno case can it be determined that an effect shall appear without its\ncause. Thus it is not simply the event that is predetermined, but the\nevent as the consequence of preceding causes; so that fate does not decide\nthe consequence alone, but also the means as the consequence of which it\nis destined to appear. Accordingly, if some means is not present, it is\ncertain that the consequence also will not be present: each is always\npresent in accordance with the determination of fate, but this is never\nknown to us till afterwards.\nAs events always take place according to fate, _i.e._, according to the\ninfinite concatenation of causes, so our actions always take place\naccording to our intelligible character. But just as we do not know the\nformer beforehand, so no _a priori_ insight is given us into the latter,\nbut we only come to know ourselves as we come to know other persons _a\nposteriori_ through experience. If the intelligible character involved\nthat we could only form a good resolution after a long conflict with a bad\ndisposition, this conflict would have to come first and be waited for.\nReflection on the unalterable nature of the character, on the unity of the\nsource from which all our actions flow, must not mislead us into claiming\nthe decision of the character in favour of one side or the other; it is in\nthe resolve that follows that we shall see what manner of men we are, and\nmirror ourselves in our actions. This is the explanation of the\nsatisfaction or the anguish of soul with which we look back on the course\nof our past life. Both are experienced, not because these past deeds have\nstill an existence; they are past, they have been, and now are no more;\nbut their great importance for us lies in their significance, lies in the\nfact that these deeds are the expression of the character, the mirror of\nthe will, in which we look and recognise our inmost self, the kernel of\nour will. Because we experience this not before, but only after, it\nbehoves us to strive and fight in time, in order that the picture we\nproduce by our deeds may be such that the contemplation of it may calm us\nas much as possible, instead of harassing us. The significance of this\nconsolation or anguish of soul will, as we have said, be inquired into\nfarther on; but to this place there belongs the inquiry which follows, and\nwhich stands by itself.\nBesides the intelligible and the empirical character, we must mention a\nthird which is different from them both, the _acquired character_, which\none only receives in life through contact with the world, and which is\nreferred to when one is praised as a man of character or censured as being\nwithout character. Certainly one might suppose that, since the empirical\ncharacter, as the phenomenon of the intelligible, is unalterable, and,\nlike every natural phenomenon, is consistent with itself, man would always\nhave to appear like himself and consistent, and would therefore have no\nneed to acquire a character artificially by experience and reflection. But\nthe case is otherwise, and although a man is always the same, yet he does\nnot always understand himself, but often mistakes himself, till he has in\nsome degree acquired real self-knowledge. The empirical character, as a\nmere natural tendency, is in itself irrational; nay, more, its expressions\nare disturbed by reason, all the more so the more intellect and power of\nthought the man has; for these always keep before him what becomes _man in\ngeneral_ as the character of the species, and what is possible for him\nboth in will and in deed. This makes it the more difficult for him to see\nhow much his individuality enables him to will and to accomplish. He finds\nin himself the germs of all the various human pursuits and powers, but the\ndifference of degree in which they exist in his individuality is not clear\nto him in the absence of experience; and if he now applies himself to the\npursuits which alone correspond to his character, he yet feels, especially\nat particular moments and in particular moods, the inclination to directly\nopposite pursuits which cannot be combined with them, but must be entirely\nsuppressed if he desires to follow the former undisturbed. For as our\nphysical path upon earth is always merely a line, not an extended surface,\nso in life, if we desire to grasp and possess one thing, we must renounce\nand leave innumerable others on the right hand and on the left. If we\ncannot make up our minds to this, but, like children at the fair, snatch\nat everything that attracts us in passing, we are making the perverse\nendeavour to change the line of our path into an extended surface; we run\nin a zigzag, skip about like a will o\u2019 the wisp, and attain to nothing.\nOr, to use another comparison, as, according to Hobbes\u2019 philosophy of law,\nevery one has an original right to everything but an exclusive right to\nnothing, yet can obtain an exclusive right to particular things by\nrenouncing his right to all the rest, while others, on their part, do\nlikewise with regard to what he has chosen; so is it in life, in which\nsome definite pursuit, whether it be pleasure, honour, wealth, science,\nart, or virtue, can only be followed with seriousness and success when all\nclaims that are foreign to it are given up, when everything else is\nrenounced. Accordingly, the mere will and the mere ability are not\nsufficient, but a man must also _know_ what he wills, and _know_ what he\ncan do; only then will he show character, and only then can he accomplish\nsomething right. Until he attains to that, notwithstanding the natural\nconsistency of the empirical character, he is without character. And\nalthough, on the whole, he must remain true to himself, and fulfil his\ncourse, led by his d\u00e6mon, yet his path will not be a straight line, but\nwavering and uneven. He will hesitate, deviate, turn back, lay up for\nhimself repentance and pain. And all this is because, in great and small,\nhe sees before him all that is possible and attainable for man in general,\nbut does not know what part of all this is alone suitable for him, can be\naccomplished by him, and is alone enjoyable by him. He will, therefore,\nenvy many men on account of a position and circumstances which are yet\nonly suitable to their characters and not to his, and in which he would\nfeel unhappy, if indeed he found them endurable at all. For as a fish is\nonly at home in water, a bird in the air, a mole in the earth, so every\nman is only at home in the atmosphere suitable to him. For example, not\nall men can breathe the air of court life. From deficiency of proper\ninsight into all this, many a man will make all kinds of abortive\nattempts, will do violence to his character in particulars, and yet, on\nthe whole, will have to yield to it again; and what he thus painfully\nattains will give him no pleasure; what he thus learns will remain dead;\neven in an ethical regard, a deed that is too noble for his character,\nthat has not sprung from pure, direct impulse, but from a concept, a\ndogma, will lose all merit, even in his own eyes, through subsequent\negoistical repentance. _Velle non discitur._ We only become conscious of\nthe inflexibility of another person\u2019s character through experience, and\ntill then we childishly believe that it is possible, by means of rational\nideas, by prayers and entreaties, by example and noble-mindedness, ever to\npersuade any one to leave his own way, to change his course of conduct, to\ndepart from his mode of thinking, or even to extend his capacities: so is\nit also with ourselves. We must first learn from experience what we desire\nand what we can do. Till then we know it not, we are without character,\nand must often be driven back to our own way by hard blows from without.\nBut if we have finally learnt it, then we have attained to what in the\nworld is called character, the _acquired character_. This is accordingly\nnothing but the most perfect knowledge possible of our own individuality.\nIt is the abstract, and consequently distinct, knowledge of the\nunalterable qualities of our own empirical character, and of the measure\nand direction of our mental and physical powers, and thus of the whole\nstrength and weakness of our own individuality. This places us in a\nposition to carry out deliberately and methodically the r\u00f4le which belongs\nto our own person, and to fill up the gaps which caprices or weaknesses\nproduce in it, under the guidance of fixed conceptions. This r\u00f4le is in\nitself unchangeably determined once for all, but hitherto we have allowed\nit to follow its natural course without any rule. We have now brought to\ndistinct conscious maxims which are always present to us the form of\nconduct which is necessarily determined by our own individual nature, and\nnow we conduct it in accordance with them as deliberately as if we had\nlearned it; without ever falling into error through the passing influence\nof the mood or the impression of the present, without being checked by the\nbitterness or sweetness of some particular thing we meet with on our path,\nwithout delay, without hesitation, without inconsistency. We shall now no\nlonger, as novices, wait, attempt, and grope about in order to see what we\nreally desire and are able to do, but we know this once for all, and in\nevery choice we have only to apply general principles to particular cases,\nand arrive at once at a decision. We know our will in general, and do not\nallow ourselves to be led by the passing mood or by solicitations from\nwithout to resolve in particular cases what is contrary to it as a whole.\nWe know in the same way the nature and the measure of our strength and our\nweakness, and thereby are spared much suffering. For we experience no real\npleasure except in the use and feeling of our own powers, and the greatest\npain is the conscious deficiency of our powers where we need them. If,\nnow, we have discovered where our strength and our weakness lie, we will\nendeavour to cultivate, employ, and in every way make use of those talents\nwhich are naturally prominent in us. We will always turn to those\noccupations in which they are valuable and to the purpose, and entirely\navoid, even with self-renunciation, those pursuits for which we have\nnaturally little aptitude; we will beware of attempting that in which we\nhave no chance of succeeding. Only he who has attained to this will\nconstantly and with full consciousness be completely himself, and will\nnever fail himself at the critical moment, because he will always have\nknown what he could expect from himself. He will often enjoy the\nsatisfaction of feeling his strength, and seldom experience the pain of\nbeing reminded of his weakness. The latter is mortification, which causes\nperhaps the greatest of mental sufferings; therefore it is far more\nendurable to have our misfortune brought clearly before us than our\nincapacity. And, further, if we are thus fully acquainted with our\nstrength and our weakness, we will not attempt to make a show of powers\nwhich we do not possess; we will not play with base coin, for all such\ndissimulation misses the mark in the end. For since the whole man is only\nthe phenomenon of his will, nothing can be more perverse than to try, by\nmeans of reflection, to become something else than one is, for this is a\ndirect contradiction of the will with itself. The imitation of the\nqualities and idiosyncrasies of others is much more shameful than to dress\nin other people\u2019s clothes; for it is the judgment of our own worthlessness\npronounced by ourselves. Knowledge of our own mind and its capacities of\nevery kind, and their unalterable limits, is in this respect the surest\nway to the attainment of the greatest possible contentment with ourselves.\nFor it holds good of inward as of outward circumstances that there is for\nus no consolation so effective as the complete certainty of unalterable\nnecessity. No evil that befalls us pains us so much as the thought of the\ncircumstances by which it might have been warded off. Therefore nothing\ncomforts us so effectually as the consideration of what has happened from\nthe standpoint of necessity, from which all accidents appear as tools in\nthe hand of an overruling fate, and we therefore recognise the evil that\nhas come to us as inevitably produced by the conflict of inner and outer\ncircumstances; in other words, fatalism. We really only complain and storm\nso long as we hope either to affect others or to excite ourselves to\nunheard-of efforts. But children and grown-up people know very well to\nyield contentedly as soon as they clearly see that it absolutely cannot be\notherwise:\u2014\u0398\u03c5\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u1f76 \u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 (_Animo in\npectoribus nostro domito necessitate_). We are like the entrapped\nelephants, that rage and struggle for many days, till they see that it is\nuseless, and then suddenly offer their necks quietly to the yoke, tamed\nfor ever. We are like King David, who, as long as his son still lived,\nunceasingly importuned Jehovah with prayers, and behaved himself as if in\ndespair; but as soon as his son was dead, thought no longer about it.\nHence it arises that innumerable permanent ills, such as lameness,\npoverty, low estate, ugliness, a disagreeable dwelling-place, are borne\nwith indifference by innumerable persons, and are no longer felt, like\nhealed wounds, just because these persons know that inward or outward\nnecessity renders it impossible that any change can take place in these\nthings; while those who are more fortunate cannot understand how such\nmisfortunes can be borne. Now as with outward necessity, so also with\ninward; nothing reconciles so thoroughly as a distinct knowledge of it. If\nwe have once for all distinctly recognised not only our good qualities and\nour strength, but also our defects and weakness, established our aim\naccordingly, and rest satisfied concerning what cannot be attained, we\nthus escape in the surest way, as far as our individuality permits, the\nbitterest of all sorrows, discontentment with ourselves, which is the\ninevitable result of ignorance of our own individuality, of false conceit\nand the audacity that proceeds from it. To the bitter chapter of the\nself-knowledge here recommended the lines of Ovid admit of excellent\napplication\u2014\n\u201c_Optimus ille animi vindex l\u00e6dentia pectus,_\n_Vincula qui rupit, dedoluitque semel._\u201d\nSo much with regard to the _acquired character_, which, indeed, is not of\nso much importance for ethics proper as for life in the world. But its\ninvestigation was related as that of a third species to the investigation\nof the intelligible and the empirical character, in regard to which we\nwere obliged to enter upon a somewhat detailed inquiry in order to bring\nout clearly how in all its phenomena the will is subject to necessity,\nwhile yet in itself it may be called free and even omnipotent.\n\u00a7 56. This freedom, this omnipotence, as the expression of which the whole\nvisible world exists and progressively develops in accordance with the\nlaws which belong to the form of knowledge, can now, at the point at which\nin its most perfect manifestation it has attained to the completely\nadequate knowledge of its own nature, express itself anew in two ways.\nEither it wills here, at the summit of mental endowment and\nself-consciousness, simply what it willed before blindly and\nunconsciously, and if so, knowledge always remains its _motive_ in the\nwhole as in the particular case. Or, conversely, this knowledge becomes\nfor it a _quieter_, which appeases and suppresses all willing. This is\nthat assertion and denial of the will to live which was stated above in\ngeneral terms. As, in the reference of individual conduct, a general, not\na particular manifestation of will, it does not disturb and modify the\ndevelopment of the character, nor does it find its expression in\nparticular actions; but, either by an ever more marked appearance of the\nwhole method of action it has followed hitherto, or conversely by the\nentire suppression of it, it expresses in a living form the maxims which\nthe will has freely adopted in accordance with the knowledge it has now\nattained to. By the explanations we have just given of freedom, necessity,\nand character, we have somewhat facilitated and prepared the way for the\nclearer development of all this, which is the principal subject of this\nlast book. But we shall have done so still more when we have turned our\nattention to life itself, the willing or not willing of which is the great\nquestion, and have endeavoured to find out generally what the will itself,\nwhich is everywhere the inmost nature of this life, will really attain by\nits assertion\u2014in what way and to what extent this assertion satisfies or\ncan satisfy the will; in short, what is generally and mainly to be\nregarded as its position in this its own world, which in every relation\nbelongs to it.\nFirst of all, I wish the reader to recall the passage with which we closed\nthe Second Book,\u2014a passage occasioned by the question, which met us then,\nas to the end and aim of the will. Instead of the answer to this question,\nit appeared clearly before us how, in all the grades of its manifestation,\nfrom the lowest to the highest, the will dispenses altogether with a final\ngoal and aim. It always strives, for striving is its sole nature, which no\nattained goal can put an end to. Therefore it is not susceptible of any\nfinal satisfaction, but can only be restrained by hindrances, while in\nitself it goes on for ever. We see this in the simplest of all natural\nphenomena, gravity, which does not cease to strive and press towards a\nmathematical centre to reach which would be the annihilation both of\nitself and matter, and would not cease even if the whole universe were\nalready rolled into one ball. We see it in the other simple natural\nphenomena. A solid tends towards fluidity either by melting or dissolving,\nfor only so will its chemical forces be free; rigidity is the imprisonment\nin which it is held by cold. The fluid tends towards the gaseous state,\ninto which it passes at once as soon as all pressure is removed from it.\nNo body is without relationship, _i.e._, without tendency or without\ndesire and longing, as Jacob B\u00f6hme would say. Electricity transmits its\ninner self-repulsion to infinity, though the mass of the earth absorbs the\neffect. Galvanism is certainly, so long as the pile is working, an\naimless, unceasingly repeated act of repulsion and attraction. The\nexistence of the plant is just such a restless, never satisfied striving,\na ceaseless tendency through ever-ascending forms, till the end, the seed,\nbecomes a new starting-point; and this repeated _ad infinitum_\u2014nowhere an\nend, nowhere a final satisfaction, nowhere a resting-place. It will also\nbe remembered, from the Second Book, that the multitude of natural forces\nand organised forms everywhere strive with each other for the matter in\nwhich they desire to appear, for each of them only possesses what it has\nwrested from the others; and thus a constant internecine war is waged,\nfrom which, for the most part, arises the resistance through which that\nstriving, which constitutes the inner nature of everything, is at all\npoints hindered; struggles in vain, yet, from its nature, cannot leave\noff; toils on laboriously till this phenomenon dies, when others eagerly\nseize its place and its matter.\nWe have long since recognised this striving, which constitutes the kernel\nand in-itself of everything, as identical with that which in us, where it\nmanifests itself most distinctly in the light of the fullest\nconsciousness, is called _will_. Its hindrance through an obstacle which\nplaces itself between it and its temporary aim we call _suffering_, and,\non the other hand, its attainment of the end satisfaction, wellbeing,\nhappiness. We may also transfer this terminology to the phenomena of the\nunconscious world, for though weaker in degree, they are identical in\nnature. Then we see them involved in constant suffering, and without any\ncontinuing happiness. For all effort springs from defect\u2014from discontent\nwith one\u2019s estate\u2014is thus suffering so long as it is not satisfied; but no\nsatisfaction is lasting, rather it is always merely the starting-point of\na new effort. The striving we see everywhere hindered in many ways,\neverywhere in conflict, and therefore always under the form of suffering.\nThus, if there is no final end of striving, there is no measure and end of\nsuffering.\nBut what we only discover in unconscious Nature by sharpened observation,\nand with an effort, presents itself distinctly to us in the intelligent\nworld in the life of animals, whose constant suffering is easily proved.\nBut without lingering over these intermediate grades, we shall turn to the\nlife of man, in which all this appears with the greatest distinctness,\nilluminated by the clearest knowledge; for as the phenomenon of will\nbecomes more complete, the suffering also becomes more and more apparent.\nIn the plant there is as yet no sensibility, and therefore no pain. A\ncertain very small degree of suffering is experienced by the lowest\nspecies of animal life\u2014infusoria and radiata; even in insects the capacity\nto feel and suffer is still limited. It first appears in a high degree\nwith the complete nervous system of vertebrate animals, and always in a\nhigher degree the more intelligence develops. Thus, in proportion as\nknowledge attains to distinctness, as consciousness ascends, pain also\nincreases, and therefore reaches its highest degree in man. And then,\nagain, the more distinctly a man knows, the more intelligent he is, the\nmore pain he has; the man who is gifted with genius suffers most of all.\nIn this sense, that is, with reference to the degree of knowledge in\ngeneral, not mere abstract rational knowledge, I understand and use here\nthat saying of the Preacher: _Qui auget scientiam, auget at dolorem._ That\nphilosophical painter or painting philosopher, Tischbein, has very\nbeautifully expressed the accurate relation between the degree of\nconsciousness and that of suffering by exhibiting it in a visible and\nclear form in a drawing. The upper half of his drawing represents women\nwhose children have been stolen, and who in different groups and\nattitudes, express in many ways deep maternal pain, anguish, and despair.\nThe lower half of the drawing represents sheep whose lambs have been taken\naway. They are arranged and grouped in precisely the same way; so that\nevery human head, every human attitude of the upper half, has below a\nbrute head and attitude corresponding to it. Thus we see distinctly how\nthe pain which is possible in the dull brute consciousness is related to\nthe violent grief, which only becomes possible through distinctness of\nknowledge and clearness of consciousness.\nWe desire to consider in this way, in _human existence_, the inner and\nessential destiny of will. Every one will easily recognise that same\ndestiny expressed in various degrees in the life of the brutes, only more\nweakly, and may also convince himself to his own satisfaction, from the\nsuffering animal world, _how essential to all life is suffering_.\n\u00a7 57. At every grade that is enlightened by knowledge, the will appears as\nan individual. The human individual finds himself as finite in infinite\nspace and time, and consequently as a vanishing quantity compared with\nthem. He is projected into them, and, on account of their unlimited\nnature, he has always a merely relative, never absolute _when_ and _where_\nof his existence; for his place and duration are finite parts of what is\ninfinite and boundless. His real existence is only in the present, whose\nunchecked flight into the past is a constant transition into death, a\nconstant dying. For his past life, apart from its possible consequences\nfor the present, and the testimony regarding the will that is expressed in\nit, is now entirely done with, dead, and no longer anything; and,\ntherefore, it must be, as a matter of reason, indifferent to him whether\nthe content of that past was pain or pleasure. But the present is always\npassing through his hands into the past; the future is quite uncertain and\nalways short. Thus his existence, even when we consider only its formal\nside, is a constant hurrying of the present into the dead past, a constant\ndying. But if we look at it from the physical side; it is clear that, as\nour walking is admittedly merely a constantly prevented falling, the life\nof our body is only a constantly prevented dying, an ever-postponed death:\nfinally, in the same way, the activity of our mind is a constantly\ndeferred ennui. Every breath we draw wards off the death that is\nconstantly intruding upon us. In this way we fight with it every moment,\nand again, at longer intervals, through every meal we eat, every sleep we\ntake, every time we warm ourselves, &c. In the end, death must conquer,\nfor we became subject to him through birth, and he only plays for a little\nwhile with his prey before he swallows it up. We pursue our life, however,\nwith great interest and much solicitude as long as possible, as we blow\nout a soap-bubble as long and as large as possible, although we know\nperfectly well that it will burst.\nWe saw that the inner being of unconscious nature is a constant striving\nwithout end and without rest. And this appears to us much more distinctly\nwhen we consider the nature of brutes and man. Willing and striving is its\nwhole being, which may be very well compared to an unquenchable thirst.\nBut the basis of all willing is need, deficiency, and thus pain.\nConsequently, the nature of brutes and man is subject to pain originally\nand through its very being. If, on the other hand, it lacks objects of\ndesire, because it is at once deprived of them by a too easy satisfaction,\na terrible void and ennui comes over it, _i.e._, its being and existence\nitself becomes an unbearable burden to it. Thus its life swings like a\npendulum backwards and forwards between pain and ennui. This has also had\nto express itself very oddly in this way; after man had transferred all\npain and torments to hell, there then remained nothing over for heaven but\nennui.\nBut the constant striving which constitutes the inner nature of every\nmanifestation of will obtains its primary and most general foundation at\nthe higher grades of objectification, from the fact that here the will\nmanifests itself as a living body, with the iron command to nourish it;\nand what gives strength to this command is just that this body is nothing\nbut the objectified will to live itself. Man, as the most complete\nobjectification of that will, is in like measure also the most necessitous\nof all beings: he is through and through concrete willing and needing; he\nis a concretion of a thousand necessities. With these he stands upon the\nearth, left to himself, uncertain about everything except his own need and\nmisery. Consequently the care for the maintenance of that existence under\nexacting demands, which are renewed every day, occupies, as a rule, the\nwhole of human life. To this is directly related the second claim, that of\nthe propagation of the species. At the same time he is threatened from all\nsides by the most different kinds of dangers, from which it requires\nconstant watchfulness to escape. With cautious steps and casting anxious\nglances round him he pursues his path, for a thousand accidents and a\nthousand enemies lie in wait for him. Thus he went while yet a savage,\nthus he goes in civilised life; there is no security for him.\n\u201c_Qualibus in tenebris vit\u00e6, quantisque periclis_\n_Degitur hocc\u2019 \u00e6vi, quodcunque est!_\u201d\u2014LUCR. ii. 15.\nThe life of the great majority is only a constant struggle for this\nexistence itself, with the certainty of losing it at last. But what\nenables them to endure this wearisome battle is not so much the love of\nlife as the fear of death, which yet stands in the background as\ninevitable, and may come upon them at any moment. Life itself is a sea,\nfull of rocks and whirlpools, which man avoids with the greatest care and\nsolicitude, although he knows that even if he succeeds in getting through\nwith all his efforts and skill, he yet by doing so comes nearer at every\nstep to the greatest, the total, inevitable, and irremediable shipwreck,\ndeath; nay, even steers right upon it: this is the final goal of the\nlaborious voyage, and worse for him than all the rocks from which he has\nescaped.\nNow it is well worth observing that, on the one hand, the suffering and\nmisery of life may easily increase to such an extent that death itself, in\nthe flight from which the whole of life consists, becomes desirable, and\nwe hasten towards it voluntarily; and again, on the other hand, that as\nsoon as want and suffering permit rest to a man, ennui is at once so near\nthat he necessarily requires diversion. The striving after existence is\nwhat occupies all living things and maintains them in motion. But when\nexistence is assured, then they know not what to do with it; thus the\nsecond thing that sets them in motion is the effort to get free from the\nburden of existence, to make it cease to be felt, \u201cto kill time,\u201d _i.e._,\nto escape from ennui. Accordingly we see that almost all men who are\nsecure from want and care, now that at last they have thrown off all other\nburdens, become a burden to themselves, and regard as a gain every hour\nthey succeed in getting through; and thus every diminution of the very\nlife which, till then, they have employed all their powers to maintain as\nlong as possible. Ennui is by no means an evil to be lightly esteemed; in\nthe end it depicts on the countenance real despair. It makes beings who\nlove each other so little as men do, seek each other eagerly, and thus\nbecomes the source of social intercourse. Moreover, even from motives of\npolicy, public precautions are everywhere taken against it, as against\nother universal calamities. For this evil may drive men to the greatest\nexcesses, just as much as its opposite extreme, famine: the people require\n_panem et circenses_. The strict penitentiary system of Philadelphia makes\nuse of ennui alone as a means of punishment, through solitary confinement\nand idleness, and it is found so terrible that it has even led prisoners\nto commit suicide. As want is the constant scourge of the people, so ennui\nis that of the fashionable world. In middle-class life ennui is\nrepresented by the Sunday, and want by the six week-days.\nThus between desiring and attaining all human life flows on throughout.\nThe wish is, in its nature, pain; the attainment soon begets satiety: the\nend was only apparent; possession takes away the charm; the wish, the\nneed, presents itself under a new form; when it does not, then follows\ndesolateness, emptiness, ennui, against which the conflict is just as\npainful as against want. That wish and satisfaction should follow each\nother neither too quickly nor too slowly reduces the suffering, which both\noccasion to the smallest amount, and constitutes the happiest life. For\nthat which we might otherwise call the most beautiful part of life, its\npurest joy, if it were only because it lifts us out of real existence and\ntransforms us into disinterested spectators of it\u2014that is, pure knowledge,\nwhich is foreign to all willing, the pleasure of the beautiful, the true\ndelight in art\u2014this is granted only to a very few, because it demands rare\ntalents, and to these few only as a passing dream. And then, even these\nfew, on account of their higher intellectual power, are made susceptible\nof far greater suffering than duller minds can ever feel, and are also\nplaced in lonely isolation by a nature which is obviously different from\nthat of others; thus here also accounts are squared. But to the great\nmajority of men purely intellectual pleasures are not accessible. They are\nalmost quite incapable of the joys which lie in pure knowledge. They are\nentirely given up to willing. If, therefore, anything is to win their\nsympathy, to be _interesting_ to them, it must (as is implied in the\nmeaning of the word) in some way excite their _will_, even if it is only\nthrough a distant and merely problematical relation to it; the will must\nnot be left altogether out of the question, for their existence lies far\nmore in willing than in knowing,\u2014action and reaction is their one element.\nWe may find in trifles and everyday occurrences the na\u00efve expressions of\nthis quality. Thus, for example, at any place worth seeing they may visit,\nthey write their names, in order thus to react, to affect the place since\nit does not affect them. Again, when they see a strange rare animal, they\ncannot easily confine themselves to merely observing it; they must rouse\nit, tease it, play with it, merely to experience action and reaction; but\nthis need for excitement of the will manifests itself very specially in\nthe discovery and support of card-playing, which is quite peculiarly the\nexpression of the miserable side of humanity.\nBut whatever nature and fortune may have done, whoever a man be and\nwhatever he may possess, the pain which is essential to life cannot be\nthrown off:\u2014\u03a0\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u1fbd \u1ff3\u03bc\u03c9\u03be\u03b5\u03bd, \u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd (_Pelides autem\nejulavit, intuitus in c\u00e6lum latum_). And again:\u2014\u0396\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b7\u03b1\n\u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1 \u03bf\u03b9\u03b6\u03c5\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03b7\u03bd (_Jovis quidem filius eram\nSaturnii; verum \u00e6rumnam habebam infinitam_). The ceaseless efforts to\nbanish suffering accomplish no more than to make it change its form. It is\nessentially deficiency, want, care for the maintenance of life. If we\nsucceed, which is very difficult, in removing pain in this form, it\nimmediately assumes a thousand others, varying according to age and\ncircumstances, such as lust, passionate love, jealousy, envy, hatred,\nanxiety, ambition, covetousness, sickness, &c., &c. If at last it can find\nentrance in no other form, it comes in the sad, grey garments of\ntediousness and ennui, against which we then strive in various ways. If\nfinally we succeed in driving this away, we shall hardly do so without\nletting pain enter in one of its earlier forms, and the dance begin again\nfrom the beginning; for all human life is tossed backwards and forwards\nbetween pain and ennui. Depressing as this view of life is, I will draw\nattention, by the way, to an aspect of it from which consolation may be\ndrawn, and perhaps even a stoical indifference to one\u2019s own present ills\nmay be attained. For our impatience at these arises for the most part from\nthe fact that we regard them as brought about by a chain of causes which\nmight easily be different. We do not generally grieve over ills which are\ndirectly necessary and quite universal; for example, the necessity of age\nand of death, and many daily inconveniences. It is rather the\nconsideration of the accidental nature of the circumstances that brought\nsome sorrow just to us, that gives it its sting. But if we have recognised\nthat pain, as such, is inevitable and essential to life, and that nothing\ndepends upon chance but its mere fashion, the form under which it presents\nitself, that thus our present sorrow fills a place that, without it, would\nat once be occupied by another which now is excluded by it, and that\ntherefore fate can affect us little in what is essential; such a\nreflection, if it were to become a living conviction, might produce a\nconsiderable degree of stoical equanimity, and very much lessen the\nanxious care for our own well-being. But, in fact, such a powerful control\nof reason over directly felt suffering seldom or never occurs.\nBesides, through this view of the inevitableness of pain, of the\nsupplanting of one pain by another, and the introduction of a new pain\nthrough the passing away of that which preceded it, one might be led to\nthe paradoxical but not absurd hypothesis, that in every individual the\nmeasure of the pain essential to him was determined once for all by his\nnature, a measure which could neither remain empty, nor be more than\nfilled, however much the form of the suffering might change. Thus his\nsuffering and well-being would by no means be determined from without, but\nonly through that measure, that natural disposition, which indeed might\nexperience certain additions and diminutions from the physical condition\nat different times, but yet, on the whole, would remain the same, and\nwould just be what is called the temperament, or, more accurately, the\ndegree in which he might be \u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 or \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, as Plato expresses it in\nthe First Book of the Republic, _i.e._, in an easy or difficult mood. This\nhypothesis is supported not only by the well-known experience that great\nsuffering makes all lesser ills cease to be felt, and conversely that\nfreedom from great suffering makes even the most trifling inconveniences\ntorment us and put us out of humour; but experience also teaches that if a\ngreat misfortune, at the mere thought of which we shuddered, actually\nbefalls us, as soon as we have overcome the first pain of it, our\ndisposition remains for the most part unchanged; and, conversely, that\nafter the attainment of some happiness we have long desired, we do not\nfeel ourselves on the whole and permanently very much better off and\nagreeably situated than before. Only the moment at which these changes\noccur affects us with unusual strength, as deep sorrow or exulting joy,\nbut both soon pass away, for they are based upon illusion. For they do not\nspring from the immediately present pleasure or pain, but only from the\nopening up of a new future which is anticipated in them. Only by borrowing\nfrom the future could pain or pleasure be heightened so abnormally, and\nconsequently not enduringly. It would follow, from the hypothesis\nadvanced, that a large part of the feeling of suffering and of well-being\nwould be subjective and determined _a priori_, as is the case with\nknowing; and we may add the following remarks as evidence in favour of it.\nHuman cheerfulness or dejection are manifestly not determined by external\ncircumstances, such as wealth and position, for we see at least as many\nglad faces among the poor as among the rich. Further, the motives which\ninduce suicide are so very different, that we can assign no motive that is\nso great as to bring it about, even with great probability, in every\ncharacter, and few that would be so small that the like of them had never\ncaused it. Now although the degree of our serenity or sadness is not at\nall times the same, yet, in consequence of this view, we shall not\nattribute it to the change of outward circumstances, but to that of the\ninner condition, the physical state. For when an actual, though only\ntemporary, increase of our serenity, even to the extent of joyfulness,\ntakes place, it usually appears without any external occasion. It is true\nthat we often see our pain arise only from some definite external\nrelation, and are visibly oppressed and saddened by this only. Then we\nbelieve that if only this were taken away, the greatest contentment would\nnecessarily ensue. But this is illusion. The measure of our pain and our\nhappiness is on the whole, according to our hypothesis, subjectively\ndetermined for each point of time, and the motive for sadness is related\nto that, just as a blister which draws to a head all the bad humours\notherwise distributed is related to the body. The pain which is at that\nperiod of time essential to our nature, and therefore cannot be shaken\noff, would, without the definite external cause of our suffering, be\ndivided at a hundred points, and appear in the form of a hundred little\nannoyances and cares about things which we now entirely overlook, because\nour capacity for pain is already filled by that chief evil which has\nconcentrated in a point all the suffering otherwise dispersed. This\ncorresponds also to the observation that if a great and pressing care is\nlifted from our breast by its fortunate issue, another immediately takes\nits place, the whole material of which was already there before, yet could\nnot come into consciousness as care because there was no capacity left for\nit, and therefore this material of care remained indistinct and unobserved\nin a cloudy form on the farthest horizon of consciousness. But now that\nthere is room, this prepared material at once comes forward and occupies\nthe throne of the reigning care of the day (\u03c0\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1). And if it is\nvery much lighter in its matter than the material of the care which has\nvanished, it knows how to blow itself out so as apparently to equal it in\nsize, and thus, as the chief care of the day, completely fills the throne.\nExcessive joy and very keen suffering always occur in the same person, for\nthey condition each other reciprocally, and are also in common conditioned\nby great activity of the mind. Both are produced, as we have just seen,\nnot by what is really present, but by the anticipation of the future. But\nsince pain is essential to life, and its degree is also determined by the\nnature of the subject, sudden changes, because they are always external,\ncannot really alter its degree. Thus an error and delusion always lies at\nthe foundation of immoderate joy or grief, and consequently both these\nexcessive strainings of the mind can be avoided by knowledge. Every\nimmoderate joy (_exultatio, insolens l\u00e6titia_) always rests on the\ndelusion that one has found in life what can never be found there\u2014lasting\nsatisfaction of the harassing desires and cares, which are constantly\nbreeding new ones. From every particular delusion of this kind one must\ninevitably be brought back later, and then when it vanishes must pay for\nit with pain as bitter as the joy its entrance caused was keen. So far,\nthen, it is precisely like a height from which one can come down only by a\nfall. Therefore one ought to avoid them; and every sudden excessive grief\nis just a fall from some such height, the vanishing of such a delusion,\nand so conditioned by it. Consequently we might avoid them both if we had\nsufficient control over ourselves to survey things always with perfect\nclearness as a whole and in their connection, and steadfastly to guard\nagainst really lending them the colours which we wish they had. The\nprincipal effort of the Stoical ethics was to free the mind from all such\ndelusion and its consequences, and to give it instead an equanimity that\ncould not be disturbed. It is this insight that inspires Horace in the\nwell-known ode\u2014\n\u201c_\u00c6quam memento rebus in arduiis_\nServare mentem, non secus in bonis\n_Ab insolenti temperatam_\n_L\u00e6titia._\u201d\nFor the most part, however, we close our minds against the knowledge,\nwhich may be compared to a bitter medicine, that suffering is essential to\nlife, and therefore does not flow in upon us from without, but that every\none carries about with him its perennial source in his own heart. We\nrather seek constantly for an external particular cause, as it were, a\npretext for the pain which never leaves us, just as the free man makes\nhimself an idol, in order to have a master. For we unweariedly strive from\nwish to wish; and although every satisfaction, however much it promised,\nwhen attained fails to satisfy us, but for the most part comes presently\nto be an error of which we are ashamed, yet we do not see that we draw\nwater with the sieve of the Danaides, but ever hasten to new desires.\n\u201c_Sed, dum abest quod avemus, id exsuperare videtur_\n_C\u00e6tera; post aliud, quum contigit illud, avemus;_\n_Et sitis \u00e6qua tenet vitai semper hiantes._\u201d\u2014LUCR. iii. 1095.\nThus it either goes on for ever, or, what is more rare and presupposes a\ncertain strength of character, till we reach a wish which is not satisfied\nand yet cannot be given up. In that case we have, as it were, found what\nwe sought, something that we can always blame, instead of our own nature,\nas the source of our suffering. And thus, although we are now at variance\nwith our fate, we are reconciled to our existence, for the knowledge is\nagain put far from us that suffering is essential to this existence\nitself, and true satisfaction impossible. The result of this form of\ndevelopment is a somewhat melancholy disposition, the constant endurance\nof a single great pain, and the contempt for all lesser sorrows or joys\nthat proceeds from it; consequently an already nobler phenomenon than that\nconstant seizing upon ever-new forms of illusion, which is much more\ncommon.\n\u00a7 58. All satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is always\nreally and essentially only _negative_, and never positive. It is not an\noriginal gratification coming to us of itself, but must always be the\nsatisfaction of a wish. The wish, _i.e._, some want, is the condition\nwhich precedes every pleasure. But with the satisfaction the wish and\ntherefore the pleasure cease. Thus the satisfaction or the pleasing can\nnever be more than the deliverance from a pain, from a want; for such is\nnot only every actual, open sorrow, but every desire, the importunity of\nwhich disturbs our peace, and, indeed, the deadening ennui also that makes\nlife a burden to us. It is, however, so hard to attain or achieve\nanything; difficulties and troubles without end are opposed to every\npurpose, and at every step hindrances accumulate. But when finally\neverything is overcome and attained, nothing can ever be gained but\ndeliverance from some sorrow or desire, so that we find ourselves just in\nthe same position as we occupied before this sorrow or desire appeared.\nAll that is even directly given us is merely the want, _i.e._, the pain.\nThe satisfaction and the pleasure we can only know indirectly through the\nremembrance of the preceding suffering and want, which ceases with its\nappearance. Hence it arises that we are not properly conscious of the\nblessings and advantages we actually possess, nor do we prize them, but\nthink of them merely as a matter of course, for they gratify us only\nnegatively by restraining suffering. Only when we have lost them do we\nbecome sensible of their value; for the want, the privation, the sorrow,\nis the positive, communicating itself directly to us. Thus also we are\npleased by the remembrance of past need, sickness, want, and such like,\nbecause this is the only means of enjoying the present blessings. And,\nfurther, it cannot be denied that in this respect, and from this\nstandpoint of egoism, which is the form of the will to live, the sight or\nthe description of the sufferings of others affords us satisfaction and\npleasure in precisely the way Lucretius beautifully and frankly expresses\nit in the beginning of the Second Book\u2014\n\u201c_Suave, mari magno, turbantibus \u00e6quora ventis,_\n_E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem:_\n_Non, quia vexari quemquam est jucunda voluptas;_\n_Sed, quibus ipse malis careas, quia cernere suave est._\u201d\nYet we shall see farther on that this kind of pleasure, through knowledge\nof our own well-being obtained in this way, lies very near the source of\nreal, positive wickedness.\nThat all happiness is only of a negative not a positive nature, that just\non this account it cannot be lasting satisfaction and gratification, but\nmerely delivers us from some pain or want which must be followed either by\na new pain, or by languor, empty longing, and ennui; this finds support in\nart, that true mirror of the world and life, and especially in poetry.\nEvery epic and dramatic poem can only represent a struggle, an effort, and\nfight for happiness, never enduring and complete happiness itself. It\nconducts its heroes through a thousand difficulties and dangers to the\ngoal; as soon as this is reached, it hastens to let the curtain fall; for\nnow there would remain nothing for it to do but to show that the\nglittering goal in which the hero expected to find happiness had only\ndisappointed him, and that after its attainment he was no better off than\nbefore. Because a genuine enduring happiness is not possible, it cannot be\nthe subject of art. Certainly the aim of the idyll is the description of\nsuch a happiness, but one also sees that the idyll as such cannot\ncontinue. The poet always finds that it either becomes epical in his\nhands, and in this case it is a very insignificant epic, made up of\ntrifling sorrows, trifling delights, and trifling efforts\u2014this is the\ncommonest case\u2014or else it becomes a merely descriptive poem, describing\nthe beauty of nature, _i.e._, pure knowing free from will, which\ncertainly, as a matter of fact, is the only pure happiness, which is\nneither preceded by suffering or want, nor necessarily followed by\nrepentance, sorrow, emptiness, or satiety; but this happiness cannot fill\nthe whole life, but is only possible at moments. What we see in poetry we\nfind again in music; in the melodies of which we have recognised the\nuniversal expression of the inmost history of the self-conscious will, the\nmost secret life, longing, suffering, and delight; the ebb and flow of the\nhuman heart. Melody is always a deviation from the keynote through a\nthousand capricious wanderings, even to the most painful discord, and then\na final return to the keynote which expresses the satisfaction and\nappeasing of the will, but with which nothing more can then be done, and\nthe continuance of which any longer would only be a wearisome and\nunmeaning monotony corresponding to ennui.\nAll that we intend to bring out clearly through these investigations, the\nimpossibility of attaining lasting satisfaction and the negative nature of\nall happiness, finds its explanation in what is shown at the conclusion of\nthe Second Book: that the will, of which human life, like every\nphenomenon, is the objectification, is a striving without aim or end. We\nfind the stamp of this endlessness imprinted upon all the parts of its\nwhole manifestation, from its most universal form, endless time and space,\nup to the most perfect of all phenomena, the life and efforts of man. We\nmay theoretically assume three extremes of human life, and treat them as\nelements of actual human life. First, the powerful will, the strong\npassions (Radscha-Guna). It appears in great historical characters; it is\ndescribed in the epic and the drama. But it can also show itself in the\nlittle world, for the size of the objects is measured here by the degree\nin which they influence the will, not according to their external\nrelations. Secondly, pure knowing, the comprehension of the Ideas,\nconditioned by the freeing of knowledge from the service of will: the life\nof genius (Satwa-Guna). Thirdly and lastly, the greatest lethargy of the\nwill, and also of the knowledge attaching to it, empty longing,\nlife-benumbing languor (Tama-Guna). The life of the individual, far from\nbecoming permanently fixed in one of these extremes, seldom touches any of\nthem, and is for the most part only a weak and wavering approach to one or\nthe other side, a needy desiring of trifling objects, constantly\nrecurring, and so escaping ennui. It is really incredible how meaningless\nand void of significance when looked at from without, how dull and\nunenlightened by intellect when felt from within, is the course of the\nlife of the great majority of men. It is a weary longing and complaining,\na dream-like staggering through the four ages of life to death,\naccompanied by a series of trivial thoughts. Such men are like clockwork,\nwhich is wound up, and goes it knows not why; and every time a man is\nbegotten and born, the clock of human life is wound up anew, to repeat the\nsame old piece it has played innumerable times before, passage after\npassage, measure after measure, with insignificant variations. Every\nindividual, every human being and his course of life, is but another short\ndream of the endless spirit of nature, of the persistent will to live; is\nonly another fleeting form, which it carelessly sketches on its infinite\npage, space and time; allows to remain for a time so short that it\nvanishes into nothing in comparison with these, and then obliterates to\nmake new room. And yet, and here lies the serious side of life, every one\nof these fleeting forms, these empty fancies, must be paid for by the\nwhole will to live, in all its activity, with many and deep sufferings,\nand finally with a bitter death, long feared and coming at last. This is\nwhy the sight of a corpse makes us suddenly so serious.\nThe life of every individual, if we survey it as a whole and in general,\nand only lay stress upon its most significant features, is really always a\ntragedy, but gone through in detail, it has the character of a comedy. For\nthe deeds and vexations of the day, the restless irritation of the moment,\nthe desires and fears of the week, the mishaps of every hour, are all\nthrough chance, which is ever bent upon some jest, scenes of a comedy. But\nthe never-satisfied wishes, the frustrated efforts, the hopes unmercifully\ncrushed by fate, the unfortunate errors of the whole life, with increasing\nsuffering and death at the end, are always a tragedy. Thus, as if fate\nwould add derision to the misery of our existence, our life must contain\nall the woes of tragedy, and yet we cannot even assert the dignity of\ntragic characters, but in the broad detail of life must inevitably be the\nfoolish characters of a comedy.\nBut however much great and small trials may fill human life, they are not\nable to conceal its insufficiency to satisfy the spirit; they cannot hide\nthe emptiness and superficiality of existence, nor exclude ennui, which is\nalways ready to fill up every pause that care may allow. Hence it arises\nthat the human mind, not content with the cares, anxieties, and\noccupations which the actual world lays upon it, creates for itself an\nimaginary world also in the form of a thousand different superstitions,\nthen finds all manner of employment with this, and wastes time and\nstrength upon it, as soon as the real world is willing to grant it the\nrest which it is quite incapable of enjoying. This is accordingly most\nmarkedly the case with nations for which life is made easy by the\ncongenial nature of the climate and the soil, most of all with the Hindus,\nthen with the Greeks, the Romans, and later with the Italians, the\nSpaniards, &c. Demons, gods, and saints man creates in his own image; and\nto them he must then unceasingly bring offerings, prayers, temple\ndecorations, vows and their fulfilment, pilgrimages, salutations,\nornaments for their images, &c. Their service mingles everywhere with the\nreal, and, indeed, obscures it. Every event of life is regarded as the\nwork of these beings; the intercourse with them occupies half the time of\nlife, constantly sustains hope, and by the charm of illusion often becomes\nmore interesting than intercourse with real beings. It is the expression\nand symptom of the actual need of mankind, partly for help and support,\npartly for occupation and diversion; and if it often works in direct\nopposition to the first need, because when accidents and dangers arise\nvaluable time and strength, instead of being directed to warding them off,\nare uselessly wasted on prayers and offerings; it serves the second end\nall the better by this imaginary converse with a visionary spirit world;\nand this is the by no means contemptible gain of all superstitions.\n\u00a7 59. If we have so far convinced ourselves _a priori_, by the most\ngeneral consideration, by investigation of the primary and elemental\nfeatures of human life, that in its whole plan it is capable of no true\nblessedness, but is in its very nature suffering in various forms, and\nthroughout a state of misery, we might now awaken this conviction much\nmore vividly within us if, proceeding more _a posteriori_, we were to turn\nto more definite instances, call up pictures to the fancy, and illustrate\nby examples the unspeakable misery which experience and history present,\nwherever one may look and in whatever direction one may seek. But the\nchapter would have no end, and would carry us far from the standpoint of\nthe universal, which is essential to philosophy; and, moreover, such a\ndescription might easily be taken for a mere declamation on human misery,\nsuch as has often been given, and, as such, might be charged with\none-sidedness, because it started from particular facts. From such a\nreproach and suspicion our perfectly cold and philosophical investigation\nof the inevitable suffering which is founded in the nature of life is\nfree, for it starts from the universal and is conducted _a priori_. But\nconfirmation _a posteriori_ is everywhere easily obtained. Every one who\nhas awakened from the first dream of youth, who has considered his own\nexperience and that of others, who has studied himself in life, in the\nhistory of the past and of his own time, and finally in the works of the\ngreat poets, will, if his judgment is not paralysed by some indelibly\nimprinted prejudice, certainly arrive at the conclusion that this human\nworld is the kingdom of chance and error, which rule without mercy in\ngreat things and in small, and along with which folly and wickedness also\nwield the scourge. Hence it arises that everything better only struggles\nthrough with difficulty; what is noble and wise seldom attains to\nexpression, becomes effective and claims attention, but the absurd and the\nperverse in the sphere of thought, the dull and tasteless in the sphere of\nart, the wicked and deceitful in the sphere of action, really assert a\nsupremacy, only disturbed by short interruptions. On the other hand,\neverything that is excellent is always a mere exception, one case in\nmillions, and therefore, if it presents itself in a lasting work, this,\nwhen it has outlived the enmity of its contemporaries, exists in\nisolation, is preserved like a meteoric stone, sprung from an order of\nthings different from that which prevails here. But as far as the life of\nthe individual is concerned, every biography is the history of suffering,\nfor every life is, as a rule, a continual series of great and small\nmisfortunes, which each one conceals as much as possible, because he knows\nthat others can seldom feel sympathy or compassion, but almost always\nsatisfaction at the sight of the woes from which they are themselves for\nthe moment exempt. But perhaps at the end of life, if a man is sincere and\nin full possession of his faculties, he will never wish to have it to live\nover again, but rather than this, he will much prefer absolute\nannihilation. The essential content of the famous soliloquy in \u201cHamlet\u201d is\nbriefly this: Our state is so wretched that absolute annihilation would be\ndecidedly preferable. If suicide really offered us this, so that the\nalternative \u201cto be or not to be,\u201d in the full sense of the word, was\nplaced before us, then it would be unconditionally to be chosen as \u201ca\nconsummation devoutly to be wished.\u201d But there is something in us which\ntells us that this is not the case: suicide is not the end; death is not\nabsolute annihilation. In like manner, what was said by the father of\nhistory(71) has not since him been contradicted, that no man has ever\nlived who has not wished more than once that he had not to live the\nfollowing day. According to this, the brevity of life, which is so\nconstantly lamented, may be the best quality it possesses. If, finally, we\nshould bring clearly to a man\u2019s sight the terrible sufferings and miseries\nto which his life is constantly exposed, he would be seized with horror;\nand if we were to conduct the confirmed optimist through the hospitals,\ninfirmaries, and surgical operating-rooms, through the prisons,\ntorture-chambers, and slave-kennels, over battle-fields and places of\nexecution; if we were to open to him all the dark abodes of misery, where\nit hides itself from the glance of cold curiosity, and, finally, allow him\nto glance into the starving dungeon of Ugolino, he, too, would understand\nat last the nature of this \u201cbest of possible worlds.\u201d For whence did Dante\ntake the materials for his hell but from this our actual world? And yet he\nmade a very proper hell of it. And when, on the other hand, he came to the\ntask of describing heaven and its delights, he had an insurmountable\ndifficulty before him, for our world affords no materials at all for this.\nTherefore there remained nothing for him to do but, instead of describing\nthe joys of paradise, to repeat to us the instruction given him there by\nhis ancestor, by Beatrice, and by various saints. But from this it is\nsufficiently clear what manner of world it is. Certainly human life, like\nall bad ware, is covered over with a false lustre: what suffers always\nconceals itself; on the other hand, whatever pomp or splendour any one can\nget, he makes a show of openly, and the more inner contentment deserts\nhim, the more he desires to exist as fortunate in the opinion of others:\nto such an extent does folly go, and the opinion of others is a chief aim\nof the efforts of every one, although the utter nothingness of it is\nexpressed in the fact that in almost all languages vanity, _vanitas_,\noriginally signifies emptiness and nothingness. But under all this false\nshow, the miseries of life can so increase\u2014and this happens every day\u2014that\nthe death which hitherto has been feared above all things is eagerly\nseized upon. Indeed, if fate will show its whole malice, even this refuge\nis denied to the sufferer, and, in the hands of enraged enemies, he may\nremain exposed to terrible and slow tortures without remedy. In vain the\nsufferer then calls on his gods for help; he remains exposed to his fate\nwithout grace. But this irremediableness is only the mirror of the\ninvincible nature of his will, of which his person is the objectivity. As\nlittle as an external power can change or suppress this will, so little\ncan a foreign power deliver it from the miseries which proceed from the\nlife which is the phenomenal appearance of that will. In the principal\nmatter, as in everything else, a man is always thrown back upon himself.\nIn vain does he make to himself gods in order to get from them by prayers\nand flattery what can only be accomplished by his own will-power. The Old\nTestament made the world and man the work of a god, but the New Testament\nsaw that, in order to teach that holiness and salvation from the sorrows\nof this world can only come from the world itself, it was necessary that\nthis god should become man. It is and remains the will of man upon which\neverything depends for him. Fanatics, martyrs, saints of every faith and\nname, have voluntarily and gladly endured every torture, because in them\nthe will to live had suppressed itself; and then even the slow destruction\nof its phenomenon was welcome to them. But I do not wish to anticipate the\nlater exposition. For the rest, I cannot here avoid the statement that, to\nme, _optimism_, when it is not merely the thoughtless talk of such as\nharbour nothing but words under their low foreheads, appears not merely as\nan absurd, but also as a really _wicked_ way of thinking, as a bitter\nmockery of the unspeakable suffering of humanity. Let no one think that\nChristianity is favourable to optimism; for, on the contrary, in the\nGospels world and evil are used as almost synonymous.(72)\n\u00a7 60. We have now completed the two expositions it was necessary to\ninsert; the exposition of the freedom of the will in itself together with\nthe necessity of its phenomenon, and the exposition of its lot in the\nworld which reflects its own nature, and upon the knowledge of which it\nhas to assert or deny itself. Therefore we can now proceed to bring out\nmore clearly the nature of this assertion and denial itself, which was\nreferred to and explained in a merely general way above. This we shall do\nby exhibiting the conduct in which alone it finds its expression, and\nconsidering it in its inner significance.\nThe _assertion of the will_ is the continuous willing itself, undisturbed\nby any knowledge, as it fills the life of man in general. For even the\nbody of a man is the objectivity of the will, as it appears at this grade\nand in this individual. And thus his willing which develops itself in time\nis, as it were, a paraphrase of his body, an elucidation of the\nsignificance of the whole and its parts; it is another way of exhibiting\nthe same thing-in-itself, of which the body is already the phenomenon.\nTherefore, instead of saying assertion of the will, we may say assertion\nof the body. The fundamental theme or subject of all the multifarious acts\nof will is the satisfaction of the wants which are inseparable from the\nexistence of the body in health, they already have their expression in it,\nand may be referred to the maintenance of the individual and the\npropagation of the species. But indirectly the most different kinds of\nmotives obtain in this way power over the will, and bring about the most\nmultifarious acts of will. Each of these is only an example, an instance,\nof the will which here manifests itself generally. Of what nature this\nexample may be, what form the motive may have and impart to it, is not\nessential; the important point here is that something is willed in general\nand the degree of intensity with which it is so willed. The will can only\nbecome visible in the motives, as the eye only manifests its power of\nseeing in the light. The motive in general stands before the will in\nprotean forms. It constantly promises complete satisfaction, the quenching\nof the thirst of will. But whenever it is attained it at once appears in\nanother form, and thus influences the will anew, always according to the\ndegree of the intensity of this will, and its relation to knowledge which\nare revealed as empirical character, in these very examples and instances.\nFrom the first appearance of consciousness, a man finds himself a willing\nbeing, and as a rule, his knowledge remains in constant relation to his\nwill. He first seeks to know thoroughly the objects of his desire, and\nthen the means of attaining them. Now he knows what he has to do, and, as\na rule, he does not strive after other knowledge. He moves and acts; his\nconsciousness keeps him always working directly and actively towards the\naims of his will; his thought is concerned with the choice of motives.\nSuch is life for almost all men; they wish, they know what they wish, and\nthey strive after it, with sufficient success to keep them from despair,\nand sufficient failure to keep them from ennui and its consequences. From\nthis proceeds a certain serenity, or at least indifference, which cannot\nbe affected by wealth or poverty; for the rich and the poor do not enjoy\nwhat they have, for this, as we have shown, acts in a purely negative way,\nbut what they hope to attain to by their efforts. They press forward with\nmuch earnestness, and indeed with an air of importance; thus children also\npursue their play. It is always an exception if such a life suffers\ninterruption from the fact that either the \u00e6sthetic demand for\ncontemplation or the ethical demand for renunciation proceed from a\nknowledge which is independent of the service of the will, and directed to\nthe nature of the world in general. Most men are pursued by want all\nthrough life, without ever being allowed to come to their senses. On the\nother hand, the will is often inflamed to a degree that far transcends the\nassertion of the body, and then violent emotions and powerful passions\nshow themselves, in which the individual not only asserts his own\nexistence, but denies and seeks to suppress that of others when it stands\nin his way.\nThe maintenance of the body through its own powers is so small a degree of\nthe assertion of will, that if it voluntarily remains at this degree, we\nmight assume that, with the death of this body, the will also which\nappeared in it would be extinguished. But even the satisfaction of the\nsexual passions goes beyond the assertion of one\u2019s own existence, which\nfills so short a time, and asserts life for an indefinite time after the\ndeath of the individual. Nature, always true and consistent, here even\nna\u00efve, exhibits to us openly the inner significance of the act of\ngeneration. Our own consciousness, the intensity of the impulse, teaches\nus that in this act the most decided _assertion of the will to live_\nexpresses itself, pure and without further addition (any denial of other\nindividuals); and now, as the consequence of this act, a new life appears\nin time and the causal series, _i.e._, in nature; the begotten appears\nbefore the begetter, different as regards the phenomenon, but in himself,\n_i.e._, according to the Idea, identical with him. Therefore it is this\nact through which every species of living creature binds itself to a whole\nand is perpetuated. Generation is, with reference to the begetter, only\nthe expression, the symptom, of his decided assertion of the will to live:\nwith reference to the begotten, it is not the cause of the will which\nappears in him, for the will in itself knows neither cause nor effect,\nbut, like all causes, it is merely the occasional cause of the phenomenal\nappearance of this will at this time in this place. As thing-in-itself,\nthe will of the begetter and that of the begotten are not different, for\nonly the phenomenon, not the thing-in-itself, is subordinate to the\n_principim individuationis_. With that assertion beyond our own body and\nextending to the production of a new body, suffering and death, as\nbelonging to the phenomenon of life, have also been asserted anew, and the\npossibility of salvation, introduced by the completest capability of\nknowledge, has for this time been shown to be fruitless. Here lies the\nprofound reason of the shame connected with the process of generation.\nThis view is mythically expressed in the dogma of Christian theology that\nwe are all partakers in Adam\u2019s first transgression (which is clearly just\nthe satisfaction of sexual passion), and through it are guilty of\nsuffering and death. In this theology goes beyond the consideration of\nthings according to the principle of sufficient reason, and recognises the\nIdea of man, the unity of which is re-established out of its dispersion\ninto innumerable individuals through the bond of generation which holds\nthem all together. Accordingly it regards every individual as on one side\nidentical with Adam, the representative of the assertion of life, and, so\nfar, as subject to sin (original sin), suffering, and death; on the other\nside, the knowledge of the Idea of man enables it to regard every\nindividual as identical with the saviour, the representative of the denial\nof the will to live, and, so far as a partaker of his sacrifice of\nhimself, saved through his merits, and delivered from the bands of sin and\ndeath, _i.e._, the world (Rom. v. 12-21).\nAnother mythical exposition of our view of sexual pleasure as the\nassertion of the will to live beyond the individual life, as an attainment\nto life which is brought about for the first time by this means, or as it\nwere a renewed assignment of life, is the Greek myth of Proserpine, who\nmight return from the lower world so long as she had not tasted its fruit,\nbut who became subject to it altogether through eating the pomegranate.\nThis meaning appears very clearly in Goethe\u2019s incomparable presentation of\nthis myth, especially when, as soon as she has tasted the pomegranate, the\ninvisible chorus of the Fates\u2014\n\u201cThou art ours!\nFasting shouldest thou return:\nAnd the bite of the apple makes thee ours!\u201d\nIt is worth noticing that Clement of Alexandria (Strom. iii. c. 15)\nillustrates the matter with the same image and the same expression: \u039f\u1f31 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\n\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd,\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f51\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f31 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2; (_Qui se castrarunt ab\nomni peccato propter regnum c\u0153lorum, ii sunt beati, a mundo jejunantes_).\nThe sexual impulse also proves itself the decided and strongest assertion\nof life by the fact that to man in a state of nature, as to the brutes, it\nis the final end, the highest goal of life. Self-maintenance is his first\neffort, and as soon as he has made provision for that, he only strives\nafter the propagation of the species: as a merely natural being he can\nattempt no more. Nature also, the inner being of which is the will to live\nitself, impels with all her power both man and the brute towards\npropagation. Then it has attained its end with the individual, and is\nquite indifferent to its death, for, as the will to live, it cares only\nfor the preservation of the species, the individual is nothing to it.\nBecause the will to live expresses itself most strongly in the sexual\nimpulse, the inner being of nature, the old poets and philosophers\u2014Hesiod\nand Parmenides\u2014said very significantly that Eros is the first, the\ncreator, the principle from which all things proceed. (Cf. Arist. Metaph.,\ni. 4.) Pherecydes said: \u0395\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0394\u03b9\u03b1, \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\n\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (_Jovem, cum mundum fabricare vellet, in cupidinem sese\ntransformasse_). _Proclus ad Plat. Tim._, l. iii. A complete treatment of\nthis subject we have recently received from G. F. Sch\u0153mann, \u201c_De Cupidine\nCosmogonico_,\u201d 1852. The M\u00e2ya of the Hindus, whose work and web is the\nwhole world of illusion, is also symbolised by love.\nThe genital organs are, far more than any other external member of the\nbody, subject merely to the will, and not at all to knowledge. Indeed, the\nwill shows itself here almost as independent of knowledge, as in those\nparts which, acting merely in consequence of stimuli, are subservient to\nvegetative life and reproduction, in which the will works blindly as in\nunconscious nature. For generation is only reproduction passing over to a\nnew individual, as it were reproduction at the second power, as death is\nonly excretion at the second power. According to all this, the genitals\nare properly the _focus_ of will, and consequently the opposite pole of\nthe brain, the representative of knowledge, _i.e._, the other side of the\nworld, the world as idea. The former are the life-sustaining principle\nensuring endless life to time. In this respect they were worshipped by the\nGreeks in the _phallus_, and by the Hindus in the _lingam_, which are thus\nthe symbol of the assertion of the will. Knowledge, on the other hand,\naffords the possibility of the suppression of willing, of salvation\nthrough freedom, of conquest and annihilation of the world.\nWe already considered fully at the beginning of this Fourth Book how the\nwill to live in its assertion must regard its relation to death. We saw\nthat death does not trouble it, because it exists as something included in\nlife itself and belonging to it. Its opposite, generation, completely\ncounterbalances it; and, in spite of the death of the individual, ensures\nand guarantees life to the will to live through all time. To express this\nthe Hindus made the _lingam_ an attribute of Siva, the god of death. We\nalso fully explained there how he who with full consciousness occupies the\nstandpoint of the decided assertion of life awaits death without fear. We\nshall therefore say nothing more about this here. Without clear\nconsciousness most men occupy this standpoint and continually assert life.\nThe world exists as the mirror of this assertion, with innumerable\nindividuals in infinite time and space, in infinite suffering, between\ngeneration and death without end. Yet from no side is a complaint to be\nfurther raised about this; for the will conducts the great tragedy and\ncomedy at its own expense, and is also its own spectator. The world is\njust what it is because the will, whose manifestation it is, is what it\nis, because it so wills. The justification of suffering is, that in this\nphenomenon also the will asserts itself; and this assertion is justified\nand balanced by the fact that the will bears the suffering. Here we get a\nglimpse of _eternal justice_ in the whole: we shall recognise it later\nmore definitely and distinctly, and also in the particular. But first we\nmust consider temporal or human justice.(73)\n\u00a7 61. It may be remembered from the Second Book that in the whole of\nnature, at all the grades of the objectification of will, there was a\nnecessary and constant conflict between the individuals of all species;\nand in this way was expressed the inner contradiction of the will to live\nwith itself. At the highest grade of the objectification, this phenomenon,\nlike all others, will exhibit itself with greater distinctness, and will\ntherefore be more easily explained. With this aim we shall next attempt to\ntrace the source of _egoism_ as the starting-point of all conflict.\nWe have called time and space the _principium individuationis_, because\nonly through them and in them is multiplicity of the homogeneous possible.\nThey are the essential forms of natural knowledge, _i.e._, knowledge\nspringing from the will. Therefore the will everywhere manifests itself in\nthe multiplicity of individuals. But this multiplicity does not concern\nthe will as thing-in-itself, but only its phenomena. The will itself is\npresent, whole and undivided, in every one of these, and beholds around it\nthe innumerably repeated image of its own nature; but this nature itself,\nthe actually real, it finds directly only in its inner self. Therefore\nevery one desires everything for himself, desires to possess, or at least\nto control, everything, and whatever opposes it it would like to destroy.\nTo this is added, in the case of such beings as have knowledge, that the\nindividual is the supporter of the knowing subject, and the knowing\nsubject is the supporter of the world, _i.e._, that the whole of Nature\noutside the knowing subject, and thus also all other individuals, exist\nonly in its idea; it is only conscious of them as its idea, thus merely\nindirectly as something which is dependent on its own nature and\nexistence; for with its consciousness the world necessarily disappears for\nit, _i.e._, its being and non-being become synonymous and\nindistinguishable. Every knowing individual is thus in truth, and finds\nitself as the whole will to live, or the inner being of the world itself,\nand also as the complemental condition of the world as idea, consequently\nas a microcosm which is of equal value with the macrocosm. Nature itself,\nwhich is everywhere and always truthful, gives him this knowledge,\noriginally and independently of all reflection, with simple and direct\ncertainty. Now from these two necessary properties we have given the fact\nmay be explained that every individual, though vanishing altogether and\ndiminished to nothing in the boundless world, yet makes itself the centre\nof the world, has regard for its own existence and well-being before\neverything else; indeed, from the natural standpoint, is ready to\nsacrifice everything else for this\u2014is ready to annihilate the world in\norder to maintain its own self, this drop in the ocean, a little longer.\nThis disposition is _egoism_, which is essential to everything in Nature.\nYet it is just through egoism that the inner conflict of the will with\nitself attains to such a terrible revelation; for this egoism has its\ncontinuance and being in that opposition of the microcosm and macrocosm,\nor in the fact that the objectification of will has the _principium\nindividuationis_ for its form, through which the will manifests itself in\nthe same way in innumerable individuals, and indeed entire and completely\nin both aspects (will and idea) in each. Thus, while each individual is\ngiven to itself directly as the whole will and the whole subject of ideas,\nother individuals are only given it as ideas. Therefore its own being, and\nthe maintenance of it, is of more importance to it than that of all others\ntogether. Every one looks upon his own death as upon the end of the world,\nwhile he accepts the death of his acquaintances as a matter of comparative\nindifference, if he is not in some way affected by it. In the\nconsciousness that has reached the highest grade, that of man, egoism, as\nwell as knowledge, pain and pleasure, must have reached its highest grade\nalso, and the conflict of individuals which is conditioned by it must\nappear in its most terrible form. And indeed we see this everywhere before\nour eyes, in small things as in great. Now we see its terrible side in the\nlives of great tyrants and miscreants, and in world-desolating wars; now\nits absurd side, in which it is the theme of comedy, and very specially\nappears as self-conceit and vanity. Rochefoucault understood this better\nthan any one else, and presented it in the abstract. We see it both in the\nhistory of the world and in our own experience. But it appears most\ndistinctly of all when any mob of men is set free from all law and order;\nthen there shows itself at once in the distinctest form the _bellum omnium\ncontra omnes_, which Hobbes has so admirably described in the first\nchapter _De Cive_. We see not only how every one tries to seize from the\nother what he wants himself, but how often one will destroy the whole\nhappiness or life of another for the sake of an insignificant addition to\nhis own happiness. This is the highest expression of egoism, the\nmanifestations of which in this regard are only surpassed by those of\nactual wickedness, which seeks, quite disinterestedly, the hurt and\nsuffering of others, without any advantage to itself. Of this we shall\nspeak soon. With this exhibition of the source of egoism the reader should\ncompare the presentation of it in my prize-essay on the basis of morals, \u00a7\n14.\nA chief source of that suffering which we found above to be essential and\ninevitable to all life is, when it really appears in a definite form, that\n_Eris_, the conflict of all individuals, the expression of the\ncontradiction, with which the will to live is affected in its inner self,\nand which attains a visible form through the _principium individuationis_.\nWild-beast fights are the most cruel means of showing this directly and\nvividly. In this original discord lies an unquenchable source of\nsuffering, in spite of the precautions that have been taken against it,\nand which we shall now consider more closely.\n\u00a7 62. It has already been explained that the first and simplest assertion\nof the will to live is only the assertion of one\u2019s own body, _i.e._, the\nexhibition of the will through acts in time, so far as the body, in its\nform and design, exhibits the same will in space, and no further. This\nassertion shows itself as maintenance of the body, by means of the\napplication of its own powers. To it is directly related the satisfaction\nof the sexual impulse; indeed this belongs to it, because the genitals\nbelong to the body. Therefore _voluntary_ renunciation of the satisfaction\nof that impulse, based upon no _motive_, is already a denial of the will\nto live, is a voluntary self-suppression of it, upon the entrance of\nknowledge which acts as a _quieter_. Accordingly such denial of one\u2019s own\nbody exhibits itself as a contradiction by the will of its own phenomenon.\nFor although here also the body objectifies in the genitals the will to\nperpetuate the species, yet this is not willed. Just on this account,\nbecause it is a denial or suppression of the will to live, such a\nrenunciation is a hard and painful self-conquest; but of this later. But\nsince the will exhibits that _self-assertion_ of one\u2019s own body in\ninnumerable individuals beside each other, it very easily extends in one\nindividual, on account of the egoism peculiar to them all, beyond this\nassertion to the _denial_ of the same will appearing in another\nindividual. The will of the first breaks through the limits of the\nassertion of will of another, because the individual either destroys or\ninjures this other body itself, or else because it compels the powers of\nthe other body to serve _its own_ will, instead of the will which\nmanifests itself in that other body. Thus if, from the will manifesting\nitself as another body, it withdraws the powers of this body, and so\nincreases the power serving its own will beyond that of its own body, it\nconsequently asserts its own will beyond its own body by means of the\nnegation of the will appearing in another body. This breaking through the\nlimits of the assertion of will of another has always been distinctly\nrecognised, and its concept denoted by the word _wrong_. For both sides\nrecognise the fact instantly, not, indeed, as we do here in distinct\nabstraction, but as feeling. He who suffers wrong feels the transgression\ninto the sphere of the assertion of his own body, through the denial of it\nby another individual, as a direct and mental pain which is entirely\nseparated and different from the accompanying physical suffering\nexperienced from the act or the vexation at the loss. To the doer of\nwrong, on the other hand, the knowledge presents itself that he is in\nhimself the same will which appears in that body also, and which asserts\nitself with such vehemence; the one phenomenon that, transgressing the\nlimits of its own body and its powers, it extends to the denial of this\nvery will in another phenomenon, and so, regarded as will in itself, it\nstrives against itself by this vehemence and rends itself. Moreover, this\nknowledge presents itself to him instantly, not _in abstracto_, but as an\nobscure feeling; and this is called remorse, or, more accurately in this\ncase, the feeling of _wrong committed_.\n_Wrong_, the conception of which we have thus analysed in its most general\nand abstract form, expresses itself in the concrete most completely,\npeculiarly, and palpably in cannibalism. This is its most distinct and\nevident type, the terrible picture of the greatest conflict of the will\nwith itself at the highest grade of its objectification, which is man.\nNext to this, it expresses itself most distinctly in murder; and therefore\nthe committal of murder is followed instantly and with fearful\ndistinctness by remorse, the abstract and dry significance of which we\nhave just given, which inflicts a wound on our peace of mind that a\nlifetime cannot heal. For our horror at the murder committed, as also our\nshrinking from the committal of it, corresponds to that infinite clinging\nto life with which everything living, as phenomenon of the will to live,\nis penetrated. (We shall analyse this feeling which accompanies the doing\nof wrong and evil, in other words, the pangs of conscience, more fully\nlater on, and raise its concept to distinctness.) Mutilation, or mere\ninjury of another body, indeed every blow, is to be regarded as in its\nnature the same as murder, and differing from it only in degree. Further,\nwrong shows itself in the subjugation of another individual, in forcing\nhim into slavery, and, finally, in the seizure of another\u2019s goods, which,\nso far as these goods are regarded as the fruit of his labour, is just the\nsame thing as making him a slave, and is related to this as mere injury is\nto murder.\nFor _property_, which is not taken from a man without _wrong_, can,\naccording to our explanation of wrong, only be that which has been\nproduced by his own powers. Therefore by taking this we really take the\npowers of his body from the will objectified in it, to make them subject\nto the will objectified in another body. For only so does the wrong-doer,\nby seizing, not the body of another, but a lifeless thing quite different\nfrom it, break into the sphere of the assertion of will of another person,\nbecause the powers, the work of this other body, are, as it were,\nincorporated and identified with this thing. It follows from this that all\ntrue, _i.e._, moral, right of property is based simply and solely on work,\nas was pretty generally assumed before Kant, and is distinctly and\nbeautifully expressed in the oldest of all codes of law: \u201cWise men who\nknow the past explain that a cultured field is the property of him who cut\ndown the wood and cleared and ploughed it, as an antelope belongs to the\nfirst hunter who mortally wounds it\u201d (Laws of Manu, ix. 44). Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy of law is an extraordinary concatenation of errors all leading\nto each other, and he bases the right of property upon first occupation.\nTo me this is only explicable on the supposition that his powers were\nfailing through old age. For how should the mere avowal of my will to\nexclude others from the use of a thing at once give me a _right_ to it?\nClearly such an avowal itself requires a foundation of right, instead of\nbeing one, as Kant assumes. And how would he act unjustly _in se_, _i.e._,\nmorally, who does not respect that claim to the sole possession of a thing\nwhich is based upon nothing but its own avowal? How should his conscience\ntrouble him about it? For it is so clear and easy to understand that there\ncan be absolutely no such thing as a just seizure of anything, but only a\njust conversion or acquired possession of it, by spending our own original\npowers upon it. When, by any foreign labour, however little, a thing has\nbeen cultivated, improved, kept from harm or preserved, even if this\nlabour were only the plucking or picking up from the ground of fruit that\nhas grown wild; the person who forcibly seizes such a thing clearly\ndeprives the other of the result of his labour expended upon it, makes the\nbody of this other serve his will instead of its own, asserts his will\nbeyond its own phenomenon to the denial of that of the other, _i.e._, does\ninjustice or wrong.(74) On the other hand, the mere enjoyment of a thing,\nwithout any cultivation or preservation of it from destruction, gives just\nas little right to it as the mere avowal of our desire for its sole\npossession. Therefore, though one family has hunted a district alone, even\nfor a hundred years, but has done nothing for its improvement; if a\nstranger comes and desires to hunt there, it cannot prevent him from doing\nso without moral injustice. Thus the so-called right of preoccupation,\naccording to which, for the mere past enjoyment of a thing, there is\ndemanded the further recompense of the exclusive right to its future\nenjoyment, is morally entirely without foundation. A new-comer might with\nfar better right reply to him who was depending upon such a right, \u201cJust\nbecause you have so long enjoyed, it is right that others should now enjoy\nalso.\u201d No moral right can be established to the sole possession of\nanything upon which labour cannot be expended, either in improving it or\nin preserving it from harm, unless it be through a voluntary surrender on\nthe part of others, as a reward for other services. This, however, already\npresupposes a community regulated by agreement\u2014the State. The morally\nestablished right of property, as we have deduced it above, gives, from\nits nature, to the owner of a thing, the same unlimited power over it\nwhich he has over his own body; and hence it follows that he can part with\nhis possessions to others either in exchange or as a gift, and they then\npossess them with the same moral right as he did.\nAs regards the doing of wrong generally, it occurs either through violence\nor through craft; it matters not which as far as what is morally essential\nis concerned. First, in the case of murder, it is a matter of indifference\nwhether I make use of a dagger or of poison; and the case of every bodily\ninjury is analogous. Other cases of wrong can all be reduced to the fact\nthat I, as the doer of wrong, compel another individual to serve my will\ninstead of his own, to act according to my will instead of according to\nhis own. On the path of violence I attain this end through physical\ncausality, but on the path of craft by means of motivation, _i.e._, by\nmeans of causality through knowledge; for I present to his will illusive\nmotives, on account of which he follows my will, while he believes he is\nfollowing his own. Since the medium in which the motives lie is knowledge,\nI can only accomplish this by falsifying his knowledge, and this is the\n_lie_. The lie always aims at influencing another\u2019s will, not merely his\nknowledge, for itself and as such, but only as a means, so far as it\ndetermines his will. For my lying itself, inasmuch as it proceeds from my\nwill, requires a motive; and only the will of another can be such a\nmotive, not his knowledge in and for itself; for as such it can never have\nan influence upon _my_ will, therefore it can never move it, can never be\na motive of its aim. But only the willing and doing of another can be\nthis, and his knowledge indirectly through it. This holds good not only of\nall lies that have manifestly sprung from self-interest, but also of those\nwhich proceed from pure wickedness, which seeks enjoyment in the painful\nconsequences of the error into which it has led another. Indeed, mere\nempty boasting aims at influencing the will and action of others more or\nless, by increasing their respect or improving their opinion of the\nboaster. The mere refusal of a truth, _i.e._, of an assertion generally,\nis in itself no wrong, but every imposing of a lie is certainly a wrong.\nHe who refuses to show the strayed traveller the right road does him no\nwrong, but he who directs him to a false road certainly does. It follows\nfrom what has been said, that every _lie_, like every act of violence, is\nas such _wrong_, because as such it has for its aim the extension of the\nauthority of my will to other individuals, and so the assertion of my will\nthrough the denial of theirs, just as much as violence has. But the most\ncomplete lie is the _broken contract_, because here all the conditions\nmentioned are completely and distinctly present together. For when I enter\ninto a contract, the promised performance of the other individual is\ndirectly and confessedly the motive for my reciprocal performance. The\npromises were deliberately and formally exchanged. The fulfilment of the\ndeclarations made is, it is assumed, in the power of each. If the other\nbreaks the covenant, he has deceived me, and by introducing merely\nillusory motives into my knowledge, he has bent my will according to his\nintention; he has extended the control of his will to another individual,\nand thus has committed a distinct wrong. On this is founded the moral\nlawfulness and validity of the _contract_.\nWrong through violence is not so _shameful_ to the doer of it as wrong\nthrough craft; for the former arises from physical power, which under all\ncircumstances impresses mankind; while the latter, by the use of\nsubterfuge, betrays weakness, and lowers man at once as a physical and\nmoral being. This is further the case because lying and deception can only\nsucceed if he who employs them expresses at the same time horror and\ncontempt of them in order to win confidence, and his victory rests on the\nfact that men credit him with honesty which he does not possess. The deep\nhorror which is always excited by cunning, faithlessness, and treachery\nrests on the fact that good faith and honesty are the bond which\nexternally binds into a unity the will which has been broken up into the\nmultiplicity of individuals, and thereby limits the consequences of the\negoism which results from that dispersion. Faithlessness and treachery\nbreak this outward bond asunder, and thus give boundless scope to the\nconsequences of egoism.\nIn the connection of our system we have found that the content of the\nconcept of _wrong_ is that quality of the conduct of an individual in\nwhich he extends the assertion of the will appearing in his own body so\nfar that it becomes the denial of the will appearing in the bodies of\nothers. We have also laid down, by means of very general examples, the\nlimits at which the province of wrong begins; for we have at once defined\nits gradations, from the highest degree to the lowest, by means of a few\nleading conceptions. According to this, the concept of wrong is the\noriginal and positive, and the concept of right, which is opposed to it,\nis the derivative and negative; for we must keep to the concepts, and not\nto the words. As a matter of fact, there would be no talk of right if\nthere were no such thing as wrong. The concept right contains merely the\nnegation of wrong, and every action is subsumed under it which does not\ntransgress the limit laid down above, _i.e._, is not a denial of the will\nof another for the stronger assertion of our own. That limit, therefore,\ndivides, as regards a purely _moral_ definition, the whole province of\npossible actions into such as are wrong or right. Whenever an action does\nnot encroach, in the way explained above, on the sphere of the assertion\nof will of another, denying it, it is not wrong. Therefore, for example,\nthe refusal of help to another in great need, the quiet contemplation of\nthe death of another from starvation while we ourselves have more than\nenough, is certainly cruel and fiendish, but it is not wrong; only it can\nbe affirmed with certainty that whoever is capable of carrying unkindness\nand hardness to such a degree will certainly also commit every wrong\nwhenever his wishes demand it and no compulsion prevents it.\nBut the conception of right as the negation of wrong finds its principal\napplication, and no doubt its origin, in cases in which an attempted wrong\nby violence is warded off. This warding off cannot itself be wrong, and\nconsequently is right, although the violence it requires, regarded in\nitself and in isolation, would be wrong, and is here only justified by the\nmotive, _i.e._, becomes right. If an individual goes so far in the\nassertion of his own will that he encroaches upon the assertion of will\nwhich is essential to my person as such, and denies it, then my warding\noff of that encroachment is only the denial of that denial, and thus from\nmy side is nothing more than the assertion of the will which essentially\nand originally appears in my body, and is already implicitly expressed by\nthe mere appearance of this body; consequently is not wrong, but right.\nThat is to say: I have then a right to deny that denial of another with\nthe force necessary to overcome it, and it is easy to see that this may\nextend to the killing of the other individual, whose encroachment as\nexternal violence pressing upon me may be warded off by a somewhat\nstronger counteraction, entirely without wrong, consequently with right.\nFor all that happens from my side lies always within the sphere of the\nassertion of will essential to my person as such, and already expressed by\nit (which is the scene of the conflict), and does not encroach on that of\nthe other, consequently is only negation of the negation, and thus\naffirmation, not itself negation. Thus if the will of another denies my\nwill, as this appears in my body and the use of its powers for its\nmaintenance, without denial of any foreign will which observes a like\nlimitation, I can _without wrong_ compel it to desist from such denial,\n_i.e._, I have so far a _right of compulsion_.\nIn all cases in which I have a right of compulsion, a complete right to\nuse _violence_ against another, I may, according to the circumstances,\njust as well oppose the violence of the other with _craft_ without doing\nany wrong, and accordingly I have an actual _right to lie precisely so far\nas I have a right of compulsion_. Therefore a man acts with perfect right\nwho assures a highway robber who is searching him that he has nothing more\nupon him; or, if a burglar has broken into his house by night, induces him\nby a lie to enter a cellar and then locks him in. A man who has been\ncaptured and carried off by robbers, for example by pirates, has the right\nto kill them not only by violence but also by craft, in order to regain\nhis freedom. Thus, also, a promise is certainly not binding when it has\nbeen extorted by direct bodily violence, because he who suffers such\ncompulsion may with full right free himself by killing, and, _a fortiori_,\nby deceiving his oppressor. Whoever cannot recover through force the\nproperty which has been stolen from him, commits no wrong if he can\naccomplish it through craft. Indeed, if some one plays with me for money\nhe has stolen from me, I have the right to use false dice against him,\nbecause all that I win from him already belongs to me. Whoever would deny\nthis must still more deny the justifiableness of stratagem in war, which\nis just an acted lie, and is a proof of the saying of Queen Christina of\nSweden, \u201cThe words of men are to be esteemed as nothing; scarcely are\ntheir deeds to be trusted.\u201d So sharply does the limit of right border upon\nthat of wrong. For the rest, I regard it as superfluous to show that all\nthis completely agrees with what was said above about the unlawfulness of\nthe lie and of violence. It may also serve to explain the peculiar theory\nof the lie told under pressure.(75)\nIn accordance with what has been said, wrong and right are merely moral\ndeterminations, _i.e._, such as are valid with regard to the consideration\nof human action as such, and in relation _to the inner significance of\nthis action in itself_. This asserts itself directly in consciousness\nthrough the fact that the doing of wrong is accompanied by an inward pain,\nwhich is the merely felt consciousness of the wrong-doer of the excessive\nstrength of the assertion of will in itself, which extends even to the\ndenial of the manifestation of the will of another, and also the\nconsciousness that although he is different from the person suffering\nwrong as far as the manifestation is concerned, yet in himself he is\nidentical with him. The further explanation of this inner significance of\nall pain of conscience cannot be given till later. He who suffers wrong\nis, on the other hand, painfully conscious of the denial of his will, as\nit is expressed through the body and its natural requirements, for the\nsatisfaction of which nature refers him to the powers of his body; and at\nthe same time he is conscious that without doing wrong he might ward off\nthat denial by every means unless he lacks the power. This purely moral\nsignificance is the only one which right and wrong have for men as men,\nnot as members of the State, and which consequently remains even when man\nis in a state of nature without any positive law. It constitutes the basis\nand the content of all that has on this account been named _natural law_,\nthough it is better called moral law, for its validity does not extend to\nsuffering, to the external reality, but only to the action of man and the\nself-knowledge of his individual will which grows up in him from his\naction, and which is called _conscience_. It cannot, however, in a state\nof nature, assert itself in all cases, and outwardly upon other\nindividuals, and prevent might from reigning instead of right. In a state\nof nature it depends upon every one merely to see that in every case he\n_does_ no wrong, but by no means to see that in every case he _suffers_ no\nwrong, for this depends on the accident of his outward power. Therefore\nthe concepts right and wrong, even in a state of nature, are certainly\nvalid and by no means conventional, but there they are valid merely as\n_moral_ concepts, for the self-knowledge of one\u2019s own will in each. They\nare a fixed point in the scale of the very different degrees of strength\nwith which the will to live asserts itself in human individuals, like the\nfreezing-point on the thermometer; the point at which the assertion of\none\u2019s own will becomes the denial of the will of another, _i.e._,\nspecifies through wrong-doing the degree of its intensity, combined with\nthe degree in which knowledge is involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_ (which is the form of all knowledge that is subject to\nthe will). But whoever wants to set aside the purely moral consideration\nof human action, or denies it, and wishes to regard conduct merely in its\noutward effects and their consequences, may certainly, with Hobbes,\nexplain right and wrong as conventional definitions arbitrarily assumed,\nand therefore not existing outside positive law, and we can never show him\nthrough external experience what does not belong to such experience.\nHobbes himself characterises his completely empirical method of thought\nvery remarkably by the fact that in his book \u201c_De Principiis Geometrarum_\u201d\nhe denies all pure mathematics properly so called, and obstinately\nmaintains that the point has extension and the line has breadth, and we\ncan never show him a point without extension or a line without breadth.\nThus we can just as little impart to him the _a priori_ nature of\nmathematics as the _a priori_ nature of right, because he shuts himself\nout from all knowledge which is not empirical.\nThe pure doctrine of right is thus a chapter of ethics, and is directly\nrelated only to _action_, not to _suffering_; for only the former is the\nexpression of will, and this alone is considered by ethics. Suffering is\nmere occurrence. Ethics can only have regard to suffering indirectly,\nmerely to show that what takes place merely to avoid suffering wrong is\nitself no infliction of wrong. The working out of this chapter of ethics\nwould contain the precise definition of the limits to which an individual\nmay go in the assertion of the will already objectified in his body\nwithout denying the same will as it appears in another individual; and\nalso the actions which transgress these limits, which consequently are\nwrong, and therefore in their turn may be warded off without wrong. Thus\nour own _action_ always remains the point of view of the investigation.\nBut the _suffering of wrong_ appears as an event in outward experience,\nand in it is manifested, as we have said, more distinctly than anywhere\nelse, the phenomenon of the conflict of the will to live with itself,\narising from the multiplicity of individuals and from egoism, both of\nwhich are conditioned through the _principium individuationis_, which is\nthe form of the world as idea for the knowledge of the individual. We also\nsaw above that a very large part of the suffering essential to human life\nhas its perennial source in that conflict of individuals.\nThe reason, however, which is common to all these individuals, and which\nenables them to know not merely the particular case, as the brutes do, but\nalso the whole abstractly in its connection, has also taught them to\ndiscern the source of that suffering, and induced them to consider the\nmeans of diminishing it, or, when possible, of suppressing it by a common\nsacrifice, which is, however, more than counterbalanced by the common\nadvantage that proceeds from it. However agreeable it is to the egoism of\nthe individual to inflict wrong in particular cases, this has yet a\nnecessary correlative in the suffering of wrong of another individual, to\nwhom it is a great pain. And because the reason which surveys the whole\nleft the one-sided point of view of the individual to which it belongs,\nand freed itself for the moment from its dependence upon it, it saw the\npleasure of an individual in inflicting wrong always outweighed by the\nrelatively greater pain of the other who suffered the wrong; and it found\nfurther, that because here everything was left to chance, every one had to\nfear that the pleasure of conveniently inflicting wrong would far more\nrarely fall to his lot than the pain of enduring it. From this reason\nrecognised that both in order to diminish the suffering which is\neverywhere disseminated, and as far as possible to divide it equally, the\nbest and only means was to spare all the pain of suffering wrong by\nrenouncing all the pleasure to be obtained by inflicting it. This means is\nthe _contract of the state_ or _law_. It is easily conceived, and little\nby little carried out by the egoism, which, through the use of reason,\nproceeds methodically and forsakes its one-sided point of view. This\norigin of the state and of law I have indicated was already exhibited as\nsuch by Plato in the \u201cRepublic.\u201d In fact, it is the essential and only\norigin, determined by the nature of the matter. Moreover, in no land can\nthe state have ever had a different origin, because it is just this mode\nof originating this aim that makes it a state. But it is a matter of\nindifference whether, in each particular nation, the condition which\npreceded it was that of a horde of savages independent of each other\n(anarchy), or that of a horde of slaves ruled at will by the stronger\n(despotism). In both cases there existed as yet no state; it first arose\nthrough that common agreement; and according as that agreement is more or\nless free from anarchy or despotism, the state is more or less perfect.\nRepublics tend to anarchy, monarchies to despotism, and the mean of\nconstitutional monarchy, which was therefore devised, tends to government\nby factions. In order to found a perfect state, we must begin by providing\nbeings whose nature allows them always to sacrifice their own to the\npublic good. Till then, however, something may be attained through the\nexistence of _one_ family whose good is quite inseparable from that of the\ncountry; so that, at least in matters of importance, it can never advance\nthe one without the other. On this rests the power and the advantage of\nthe hereditary monarchy.\nNow as ethics was concerned exclusively with right and wrong doing, and\ncould accurately point out the limits of his action to whoever was\nresolved to do no wrong; politics, on the contrary, the theory of\nlegislation, is exclusively concerned with the _suffering_ of wrong, and\nwould never trouble itself with wrong-doing at all if it were not on\naccount of its ever-necessary correlative, the suffering of wrong, which\nit always keeps in view as the enemy it opposes. Indeed, if it were\npossible to conceive an infliction of wrong with which no suffering of\nwrong on the part of another was connected, the state would, consistently,\nby no means prohibit it. And because in ethics the will, the disposition,\nis the object of consideration, and the only real thing, the firm will to\ndo wrong, which is only restrained and rendered ineffective by external\nmight, and the actually committed wrong, are to it quite the same, and it\ncondemns him who so wills as unjust at its tribunal. On the other hand,\nwill and disposition, merely as such, do not concern the state at all, but\nonly the _deed_ (whether it is merely attempted or carried out), on\naccount of its correlative, the _suffering_ on the part of another. Thus\nfor the state the deed, the event, is the only real; the disposition, the\nintention, is only investigated so far as the significance of the deed\nbecomes known through it. Therefore the state will forbid no one to carry\nabout in his thought murder and poison against another, so long as it\nknows certainly that the fear of the sword and the wheel will always\nrestrain the effects of that will. The state has also by no means to\neradicate the foolish purpose, the inclination to wrong-doing, the wicked\ndisposition; but merely always to place beside every possible motive for\ndoing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the\ninevitable punishment that will ensue. Therefore the criminal code is as\ncomplete a register as possible of motives against every criminal action\nthat can possibly be imagined\u2014both _in abstracto_, in order to make any\ncase that occurs an application _in concreto_. Politics or legislation\nwill therefore for this end borrow from that chapter of ethics which is\nthe doctrine of right, and which, besides the inner significance of right\nand wrong, determines the exact limits between them. Yet it will only do\nso for the purpose of making use of its reverse side, and regarding all\nthe limits which ethics lays down as not to be transgressed, if we are to\navoid _doing_ wrong, from the other side, as the limits which we must not\nallow others to transgress if we do not wish to _suffer_ wrong, and from\nwhich we have therefore a _right_ to drive others back. Therefore these\nlimits are, as much as possible, from the passive side, barricaded by\nlaws. It is evident that as an historian has very wittily been called an\ninverted prophet, the professor of law is an inverted moralist, and\ntherefore law itself, in its proper sense, _i.e._, the doctrine of the\n_right_, which we ought to maintain, is inverted ethics in that chapter of\nit in which the rights are laid down which we ought not to violate. The\nconcept of wrong and its negation, that of right, which is originally\n_ethical_, becomes _juridical_ by the transference of the starting-point\nfrom the active to the passive side, and thus by inversion. This, as well\nas Kant\u2019s theory of law, which very falsely deduces the institution of the\nstate as a moral duty from his categorical imperative, has, even in the\nmost recent times, repeatedly occasioned the very extraordinary error that\nthe state is an institution for furthering morality; that it arises from\nthe endeavour after this, and is, consequently, directed against egoism.\nAs if the inward disposition, to which alone morality or immorality\nbelongs, the externally free will, would allow itself to be modified from\nwithout and changed by influences exerted upon it! Still more perverse is\nthe theory that the state is the condition of freedom in the moral sense,\nand in this way the condition of morality; for freedom lies beyond the\nphenomenon, and indeed beyond human arrangements. The state is, as we have\nsaid, so little directed against egoism in general and as such, that, on\nthe contrary, it has sprung from egoism and exists only in its service\u2014an\negoism that well understands itself, proceeds methodically and forsakes\nthe one-sided for the universal point of view, and so by addition is the\ncommon egoism of all. The state is thus instituted under the correct\npresupposition that pure morality, _i.e._, right action from moral\ngrounds, is not to be expected; if this were not the case, it would itself\nbe superfluous. Thus the state, which aims at well-being, is by no means\ndirected against egoism, but only against the disadvantageous consequences\nwhich arise from the multiplicity of egoistic individuals, and\nreciprocally affect them all and disturb their well-being. Therefore it\nwas already said by Aristotle (De. Rep. iii.): \u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03c5\n\u03b6\u03b7\u03bd; \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b6\u1fc3\u03bd \u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c2 (_Finis civitatis est bene\nvivere, hoc autem est beate et pulchre vivere_). Hobbes also has\naccurately and excellently expounded this origin and end of the state; and\nthat old first principle of all state policy, _salus publica prima lex\nesto_, indicates the same thing. If the state completely attains its end,\nit will produce the same outward result as if perfect justice of\ndisposition prevailed everywhere. But the inner nature and origin of both\nphenomena will be the converse. Thus in the second case it would be that\nno one wished to _do_ wrong, and in the first that no one wished to\n_suffer_ wrong, and the means appropriate to this end had been fully\nemployed. Thus the same line may be drawn from opposite directions, and a\nbeast of prey with a muzzle is as harmless as a graminivorous animal. But\nbeyond this point the state cannot go. It cannot exhibit a phenomenon such\nas would spring from universal mutual well-wishing and love. For just as\nwe found that from its nature it would not forbid the doing of a wrong\nwhich involved no corresponding suffering of wrong on the part of another,\nand prohibits all wrong-doing only because this is impossible; so\nconversely, in accordance with its tendency towards the well-being of all,\nit would very gladly take care that every benevolent action and work of\nhuman love should be _experienced_, if it were not that these also have an\ninevitable correlative in the _performance_ of acts of benevolence and\nworks of love, and every member of the state would wish to assume the\npassive and none the active r\u00f4le, and there would be no reason for\nexacting the latter from one member of the state rather than from another.\nAccordingly only the negative, which is just the _right_, not the\npositive, which has been comprehended under the name of obligations of\nlove, or, less completely, duties, _can be exacted by force_.\nLegislation, as we have said, borrows the pure philosophy of right, or the\ndoctrine of the nature and limits of right and wrong, from ethics, in\norder to apply it from the reverse side to its own ends, which are\ndifferent from those of ethics, and to institute positive legislation and\nthe means of supporting it, _i.e._, the state, in accordance with it.\nPositive legislation is thus the inverted application of the purely moral\ndoctrine of right. This application may be made with reference to the\npeculiar relations and circumstances of a particular people. But only if\nthe positive legislation is, in essential matters, throughout determined\nin accordance with the guidance of the pure theory of right, and for each\nof its propositions a ground can be established in the pure theory of\nright, is the legislation which has arisen a _positive right_ and the\nstate a community _based upon right_, a _state_ in the proper meaning of\nthe word, a morally permissible, not immoral institution. Otherwise the\npositive legislation is, on the contrary, the establishment of a _positive\nwrong_; it is itself an openly avowed enforced wrong. Such is every\ndespotism, the constitution of most Mohammedan kingdoms; and indeed\nvarious parts of many constitutions are also of this kind; for example,\nserfdom, vassalage, and many such institutions. The pure theory of right\nor natural right\u2014better, moral right\u2014though always reversed, lies at the\nfoundation of every just positive legislation, as pure mathematics lies at\nthe foundation of every branch of applied mathematics. The most important\npoints of the doctrine of right, as philosophy has to supply it for that\nend to legislation, are the following: 1. The explanation of the inner and\nreal significance both of the origin of the conceptions of wrong and\nright, and of their application and position in ethics. 2. The deduction\nof the law of property. 3. The deduction of the moral validity of\ncontracts; for this is the moral basis of the contract of the state. 4.\nThe explanation of the origin and the aim of the state, of the relation of\nthis aim to ethics, and of the intentional transference of the ethical\ndoctrine of right, by reversing it, to legislation, in consequence of this\nrelation. 5. The deduction of the right of punishment. The remaining\ncontent of the doctrine of right is mere application of these principles,\nmere accurate definition of the limits of right and wrong for all possible\nrelations of life, which are consequently united and distributed under\ncertain points of view and titles. In these special doctrines the books\nwhich treat of pure law are fairly at one; it is only in the principles\nthat they differ much, for these are always connected with some\nphilosophical system. In connection with our system, we have explained the\nfirst four of these principal points shortly and generally, yet definitely\nand distinctly, and it remains for us to speak in the same way of the\nright of punishment.\nKant makes the fundamentally false assertion that apart from the state\nthere would be no complete right of property. It follows from our\ndeduction, as given above, that even in a state of nature there is\nproperty with complete natural, _i.e._, moral right, which cannot be\ninjured without wrong, but may without wrong be defended to the uttermost.\nOn the other hand, it is certain that apart from the state there is no\nright of punishment. All right to punish is based upon the positive law\nalone, which _before_ the offence has determined a punishment for it, the\nthreat of which, as a counter-motive, is intended to outweigh all possible\nmotives for the offence. This positive law is to be regarded as sanctioned\nand recognised by all the members of the state. It is thus based upon a\ncommon contract which the members of the state are in duty bound to\nfulfil, and thus, on the one hand, to inflict the punishment, and, on the\nother hand, to endure it; thus the endurance of the punishment may with\nright be enforced. Consequently the immediate _end of punishment_ is, in\nthe particular case, _the fulfilment of the law as a contract_. But the\none end of the _law_ is _deterrence_ from the infringement of the rights\nof others. For, in order that every one may be protected from suffering\nwrong, men have combined to form a state, have renounced the doing of\nwrong, and assumed the task of maintaining the state. Thus the law and the\nfulfilment of it, the punishment, are essentially directed to the\n_future_, not to the _past_. This distinguishes _punishment_ from\n_revenge_; for the motives which instigate the latter are solely concerned\nwith what has happened, and thus with the past as such. All requital of\nwrong by the infliction of pain, without any aim for the future, is\nrevenge, and can have no other end than consolation for the suffering one\nhas borne by the sight of the suffering one has inflicted upon another.\nThis is wickedness and cruelty, and cannot be morally justified. Wrong\nwhich some one has inflicted upon me by no means entitles me to inflict\nwrong upon him. The requital of evil with evil without further intention\nis neither morally nor otherwise through any rational ground to be\njustified, and the _jus talionis_ set up as the absolute, final principle\nof the right of punishment, is meaningless. Therefore Kant\u2019s theory of\npunishment as mere requital for requital\u2019s sake is a completely groundless\nand perverse view. Yet it is always appearing in the writings of many\njurists, under all kinds of lofty phrases, which amount to nothing but\nempty words, as: Through the punishment the crime is expiated or\nneutralised and abolished, and many such. But no man has the right to set\nhimself up as a purely moral judge and requiter, and punish the misdeeds\nof another with pains which he inflicts upon him, and so to impose penance\nupon him for his sins. Nay, this would rather be the most presumptuous\narrogance; and therefore the Bible says, \u201cVengeance is mine; I will repay,\nsaith the Lord.\u201d But man has the right to care for the safety of society;\nand this can only be done by interdicting all actions which are denoted by\nthe word \u201ccriminal,\u201d in order to prevent them by means of counter-motives,\nwhich are the threatened punishments. And this threat can only be made\neffective by carrying it out when a case occurs in spite of it.\nAccordingly that the end of punishment, or more accurately of penal law,\nis the deterrence from crime, is a truth so generally recognised and\nindeed self-evident, that in England it is expressed in the very old form\nof indictment which is still served by the counsel for the Crown in\ncriminal actions, for it concludes with the words, \u201cIf this be proved,\nyou, the said N. N., ought to be punished with pains of law, to deter\nothers from the like crimes in all time coming.\u201d If a prince desires to\nextend mercy to a criminal who has justly been condemned, his Ministers\nwill represent to him that, if he does, this crime will soon be repeated.\nAn end for the future distinguishes punishment from revenge, and\npunishment only has this end when it is inflicted _in fulfilment of a\nlaw_. It thus announces itself as inevitable in every future case, and\nthus the law obtains the power to deter, in which its end really consists.\nNow here a Kantian would inevitably reply that certainly according to this\nview the punished criminal would be used \u201cmerely as a means.\u201d This\nproposition, so unweariedly repeated by all the Kantians, \u201cMan must always\nbe treated as an end, never as a means,\u201d certainly sounds significant, and\nis therefore a very suitable proposition for those who like to have a\nformula which saves them all further thought; but looked at in the light,\nit is an exceedingly vague, indefinite assertion, which reaches its aim\nquite indirectly, requires to be explained, defined, and modified in every\ncase of its application, and, if taken generally, is insufficient, meagre,\nand moreover problematical. The murderer who has been condemned to the\npunishment of death according to law must now, at any rate, and with\ncomplete right, be used as a mere means. For public security, the chief\nend of the state, is disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law\nis not carried out. The murderer, his life, his person, must now be the\nmeans of fulfilling the law, and thereby of re-establishing the public\nsecurity. And he is made such a means with perfect right, in fulfilment of\nthe contract of the state, which was entered into by him because he was a\ncitizen, and in accordance with which, in order to enjoy security for his\nlife, freedom, and property, he has pledged his life, his freedom, and his\nproperty for the security of all, which pledge has now been forfeited.\nThis theory of punishment which we have established, the theory which is\ndirectly supported by sound reason, is certainly in the main no new\nthought; but it is a thought which was almost supplanted by new errors,\nand therefore it was necessary to exhibit it as distinctly as possible.\nThe same thing is in its essence contained in what Puffendorf says on the\nsubject, \u201c_De Officio Hominis et Civis_\u201d (Bk. ii. chap. 12). Hobbes also\nagrees with it, \u201cLeviathan\u201d (chaps. 15-28). In our own day Feurbach is\nwell known to have maintained it. Indeed, it occurs even in the utterances\nof the ancient philosophers. Plato expresses it clearly in the\n\u201cProtagoras\u201d (p. 114, edit. Bip.), also in the \u201cGorgias\u201d (p. 168), and\nlastly in the eleventh book of the \u201cLaws\u201d (p. 165). Seneca expresses\nPlato\u2019s opinion and the theory of all punishment in the short sentence,\n\u201c_Nemo prudens punit, quia peccatum est; sed ne peccetur_\u201d (De Ira, i.\n16).\nThus we have come to recognise in the state the means by which egoism\nendowed with reason seeks to escape from its own evil consequences which\nturn against itself, and now each promotes the well-being of all because\nhe sees that his own well-being is involved in it. If the state attained\nits end completely, then to a certain extent something approaching to an\nUtopia might finally, by the removal of all kinds of evil, be brought\nabout. For by the human powers united in it, it is able to make the rest\nof nature more and more serviceable. But as yet the state has always\nremained very far from this goal. And even if it attained to it,\ninnumerable evils essential to all life would still keep it in suffering;\nand finally, if they were all removed, ennui would at once occupy every\nplace they left. And besides, the strife of individuals is never\ncompletely abolished by the state, for it vexes in trifles when it is\nprohibited in greater things. Finally, Eris, happily expelled from within,\nturns to what is without; as the conflict of individuals, she is banished\nby the institution of the state; but she reappears from without as the war\nof nations, and now demands in bulk and at once, as an accumulated debt,\nthe bloody sacrifice which by wise precautions has been denied her in the\nparticular. And even supposing that all this were finally overcome and\nremoved, by wisdom founded on the experience of thousands of years, at the\nend the result would be the actual over-population of the whole planet,\nthe terrible evil of which only a bold imagination can now realise.(76)\n\u00a7 63. We have recognised _temporal justice_, which has its seat in the\nstate, as requiting and punishing, and have seen that this only becomes\njustice through a reference to the _future_. For without this reference\nall punishing and requiting would be an outrage without justification, and\nindeed merely the addition of another evil to that which has already\noccurred, without meaning or significance. But it is quite otherwise with\n_eternal justice_, which was referred to before, and which rules not the\nstate but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not\nsubject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring,\nbut infallible, fixed, and sure. The conception of requital implies that\nof time; therefore _eternal justice_ cannot be requital. Thus it cannot,\nlike temporal justice, admit of respite and delay, and require time in\norder to triumph, equalising the evil deed by the evil consequences only\nby means of time.

Est tamen ultio,\nEt, si intuemur, illa nos habitat prope.\u201d)\nNow that such an eternal justice really lies in the nature of the world\nwill soon become completely evident to whoever has grasped the whole of\nthe thought which we have hitherto been developing.\nThe world, in all the multiplicity of its parts and forms, is the\nmanifestation, the objectivity, of the one will to live. Existence itself,\nand the kind of existence, both as a collective whole and in every part,\nproceeds from the will alone. The will is free, the will is almighty. The\nwill appears in everything, just as it determines itself in itself and\noutside time. The world is only the mirror of this willing; and all\nfinitude, all suffering, all miseries, which it contains, belong to the\nexpression of that which the will wills, are as they are because the will\nso wills. Accordingly with perfect right every being supports existence in\ngeneral, and also the existence of its species and its peculiar\nindividuality, entirely as it is and in circumstances as they are, in a\nworld such as it is, swayed by chance and error, transient, ephemeral, and\nconstantly suffering; and in all that it experiences, or indeed can\nexperience, it always gets its due. For the will belongs to it; and as the\nwill is, so is the world. Only this world itself can bear the\nresponsibility of its own existence and nature\u2014no other; for by what means\ncould another have assumed it? Do we desire to know what men, morally\nconsidered, are worth as a whole and in general, we have only to consider\ntheir fate as a whole and in general. This is want, wretchedness,\naffliction, misery, and death. Eternal justice reigns; if they were not,\nas a whole, worthless, their fate, as a whole, would not be so sad. In\nthis sense we may say, the world itself is the judgment of the world. If\nwe could lay all the misery of the world in one scale of the balance, and\nall the guilt of the world in the other, the needle would certainly point\nto the centre.\nCertainly, however, the world does not exhibit itself to the knowledge of\nthe individual as such, developed for the service of the will, as it\nfinally reveals itself to the inquirer as the objectivity of the one and\nonly will to live, which he himself is. But the sight of the uncultured\nindividual is clouded, as the Hindus say, by the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2. He sees not\nthe thing-in-itself but the phenomenon in time and space, the _principium\nindividuationis_, and in the other forms of the principle of sufficient\nreason. And in this form of his limited knowledge he sees not the inner\nnature of things, which is one, but its phenomena as separated, disunited,\ninnumerable, very different, and indeed opposed. For to him pleasure\nappears as one thing and pain as quite another thing: one man as a\ntormentor and a murderer, another as a martyr and a victim; wickedness as\none thing and evil as another. He sees one man live in joy, abundance, and\npleasure, and even at his door another die miserably of want and cold.\nThen he asks, Where is the retribution? And he himself, in the vehement,\npressure of will which is his origin and his nature, seizes upon the\npleasures and enjoyments of life, firmly embraces them, and knows not that\nby this very act of his will he seizes and hugs all those pains and\nsorrows at the sight of which he shudders. He sees the ills and he sees\nthe wickedness in the world, but far from knowing that both of these are\nbut different sides of the manifestation of the one will to live, he\nregards them as very different, and indeed quite opposed, and often seeks\nto escape by wickedness, _i.e._, by causing the suffering of another, from\nills, from the suffering of his own individuality, for he is involved in\nthe _principium individuationis_, deluded by the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2. Just as a\nsailor sits in a boat trusting to his frail barque in a stormy sea,\nunbounded in every direction, rising and falling with the howling\nmountainous waves; so in the midst of a world of sorrows the individual\nman sits quietly, supported by and trusting to the _principium\nindividuationis_, or the way in which the individual knows things as\nphenomena. The boundless world, everywhere full of suffering in the\ninfinite past, in the infinite future, is strange to him, indeed is to him\nbut a fable; his ephemeral person, his extensionless present, his\nmomentary satisfaction, this alone has reality for him; and he does all to\nmaintain this, so long as his eyes are not opened by a better knowledge.\nTill then, there lives only in the inmost depths of his consciousness a\nvery obscure presentiment that all that is after all not really so strange\nto him, but has a connection with him, from which the _principium\nindividuationis_ cannot protect him. From this presentiment arises that\nineradicable _awe_ common to all men (and indeed perhaps even to the most\nsensible of the brutes) which suddenly seizes them if by any chance they\nbecome puzzled about the _principium individuationis_, because the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in some one of its forms seems to admit of\nan exception. For example, if it seems as if some change took place\nwithout a cause, or some one who is dead appears again, or if in any other\nway the past or the future becomes present or the distant becomes near.\nThe fearful terror at anything of the kind is founded on the fact that\nthey suddenly become puzzled about the forms of knowledge of the\nphenomenon, which alone separate their own individuality from the rest of\nthe world. But even this separation lies only in the phenomenon, and not\nin the thing-in-itself; and on this rests eternal justice. In fact, all\ntemporal happiness stands, and all prudence proceeds, upon ground that is\nundermined. They defend the person from accidents and supply its\npleasures; but the person is merely phenomenon, and its difference from\nother individuals, and exemption from the sufferings which they endure,\nrests merely in the form of the phenomenon, the _principium\nindividuationis_. According to the true nature of things, every one has\nall the suffering of the world as his own, and indeed has to regard all\nmerely possible suffering as for him actual, so long as he is the fixed\nwill to live, _i.e._, asserts life with all his power. For the knowledge\nthat sees through the _principium individuationis_, a happy life in time,\nthe gift of chance or won by prudence, amid the sorrows of innumerable\nothers, is only the dream of a beggar in which he is a king, but from\nwhich he must awake and learn from experience that only a fleeting\nillusion had separated him from the suffering of his life.\nEternal justice withdraws itself from the vision that is involved in the\nknowledge which follows the principle of sufficient reason in the\n_principium individuationis_; such vision misses it altogether unless it\nvindicates it in some way by fictions. It sees the bad, after misdeeds and\ncruelties of every kind, live in happiness and leave the world unpunished.\nIt sees the oppressed drag out a life full of suffering to the end without\nan avenger, a requiter appearing. But that man only will grasp and\ncomprehend eternal justice who raises himself above the knowledge that\nproceeds under the guidance of the principle of sufficient reason, bound\nto the particular thing, and recognises the Ideas, sees through the\n_principium individuationis_, and becomes conscious that the forms of the\nphenomenon do not apply to the thing-in-itself. Moreover, he alone, by\nvirtue of the same knowledge, can understand the true nature of virtue, as\nit will soon disclose itself to us in connection with the present inquiry,\nalthough for the practice of virtue this knowledge in the abstract is by\nno means demanded. Thus it becomes clear to whoever has attained to the\nknowledge referred to, that because the will is the in-itself of all\nphenomena, the misery which is awarded to others and that which he\nexperiences himself, the bad and the evil, always concerns only that one\ninner being which is everywhere the same, although the phenomena in which\nthe one and the other exhibits itself exist as quite different\nindividuals, and are widely separated by time and space. He sees that the\ndifference between him who inflicts the suffering and him who must bear it\nis only the phenomenon, and does not concern the thing-in-itself, for this\nis the will living in both, which here, deceived by the knowledge which is\nbound to its service, does not recognise itself, and seeking an increased\nhappiness in _one_ of its phenomena, produces great suffering in\n_another_, and thus, in the pressure of excitement, buries its teeth in\nits own flesh, not knowing that it always injures only itself, revealing\nin this form, through the medium of individuality, the conflict with\nitself which it bears in its inner nature. The inflicter of suffering and\nthe sufferer are one. The former errs in that he believes he is not a\npartaker in the suffering; the latter, in that he believes he is not a\npartaker in the guilt. If the eyes of both were opened, the inflicter of\nsuffering would see that he lives in all that suffers pain in the wide\nworld, and which, if endowed with reason, in vain asks why it was called\ninto existence for such great suffering, its desert of which it does not\nunderstand. And the sufferer would see that all the wickedness which is or\never was committed in the world proceeds from that will which constitutes\n_his_ own nature also, appears also in _him_, and that through this\nphenomenon and its assertion he has taken upon himself all the sufferings\nwhich proceed from such a will and bears them as his due, so long as he is\nthis will. From this knowledge speaks the profound poet Calderon in \u201cLife\na Dream\u201d\u2014\n\u201cPues el delito mayor\nDel hombre es haber nacido.\u201d\n(\u201cFor the greatest crime of man\nIs that he ever was born.\u201d)\nWhy should it not be a crime, since, according to an eternal law, death\nfollows upon it? Calderon has merely expressed in these lines the\nChristian dogma of original sin.\nThe living knowledge of eternal justice, of the balance that inseparably\nbinds together the _malum culp\u00e6_ with the _malum p\u0153n\u00e6_, demands the\ncomplete transcending of individuality and the principle of its\npossibility. Therefore it will always remain unattainable to the majority\nof men, as will also be the case with the pure and distinct knowledge of\nthe nature of all virtue, which is akin to it, and which we are about to\nexplain. Accordingly the wise ancestors of the Hindu people have directly\nexpressed it in the Vedas, which are only allowed to the three regenerate\ncastes, or in their esoteric teaching, so far at any rate as conception\nand language comprehend it, and their method of exposition, which always\nremains pictorial and even rhapsodical, admits; but in the religion of the\npeople, or exoteric teaching, they only communicate it by means of myths.\nThe direct exposition we find in the Vedas, the fruit of the highest human\nknowledge and wisdom, the kernel of which has at last reached us in the\nUpanishads as the greatest gift of this century. It is expressed in\nvarious ways, but especially by making all the beings in the world, living\nand lifeless, pass successively before the view of the student, and\npronouncing over every one of them that word which has become a formula,\nand as such has been called the Mahavakya: Tatoumes,\u2014more correctly, Tat\ntwam asi,\u2014which means, \u201cThis thou art.\u201d(77) But for the people, that great\ntruth, so far as in their limited condition they could comprehend it, was\ntranslated into the form of knowledge which follows the principle of\nsufficient reason. This form of knowledge is indeed, from its nature,\nquite incapable of apprehending that truth pure and in itself, and even\nstands in contradiction to it, yet in the form of a myth it received a\nsubstitute for it which was sufficient as a guide for conduct. For the\nmyth enables the method of knowledge, in accordance with the principle of\nsufficient reason, to comprehend by figurative representation the ethical\nsignificance of conduct, which itself is ever foreign to it. This is the\naim of all systems of religion, for as a whole they are the mythical\nclothing of the truth which is unattainable to the uncultured human\nintellect. In this sense this myth might, in Kant\u2019s language, be called a\npostulate of the practical reason; but regarded as such, it has the great\nadvantage that it contains absolutely no elements but such as lie before\nour eyes in the course of actual experience, and can therefore support all\nits conceptions with perceptions. What is here referred to is the myth of\nthe transmigration of souls. It teaches that all sufferings which in life\none inflicts upon other beings must be expiated in a subsequent life in\nthis world, through precisely the same sufferings; and this extends so\nfar, that he who only kills a brute must, some time in endless time, be\nborn as the same kind of brute and suffer the same death. It teaches that\nwicked conduct involves a future life in this world in suffering and\ndespised creatures, and, accordingly, that one will then be born again in\nlower castes, or as a woman, or as a brute, as Pariah or Tschandala, as a\nleper, or as a crocodile, and so forth. All the pains which the myth\nthreatens it supports with perceptions from actual life, through suffering\ncreatures which do not know how they have merited their misery, and it\ndoes not require to call in the assistance of any other hell. As a reward,\non the other hand, it promises re-birth in better, nobler forms, as\nBrahmans, wise men, or saints. The highest reward, which awaits the\nnoblest deeds and the completest resignation, which is also given to the\nwoman who in seven successive lives has voluntarily died on the funeral\npile of her husband, and not less to the man whose pure mouth has never\nuttered a single lie,\u2014this reward the myth can only express negatively in\nthe language of this world by the promise, which is so often repeated,\nthat they shall never be born again, _Non adsumes iterum existentiam\napparentem_; or, as the Buddhists, who recognise neither Vedas nor castes,\nexpress it, \u201cThou shalt attain to Nirv\u00e2na,\u201d _i.e._, to a state in which\nfour things no longer exist\u2014birth, age, sickness, and death.\nNever has a myth entered, and never will one enter, more closely into the\nphilosophical truth which is attainable to so few than this primitive\ndoctrine of the noblest and most ancient nation. Broken up as this nation\nnow is into many parts, this myth yet reigns as the universal belief of\nthe people, and has the most decided influence upon life to-day, as four\nthousand years ago. Therefore Pythagoras and Plato have seized with\nadmiration on that _ne plus ultra_ of mythical representation, received it\nfrom India or Egypt, honoured it, made use of it, and, we know not how\nfar, even believed it. We, on the contrary, now send the Brahmans English\nclergymen and evangelical linen-weavers to set them right out of sympathy,\nand to show them that they are created out of nothing, and ought\nthankfully to rejoice in the fact. But it is just the same as if we fired\na bullet against a cliff. In India our religions will never take root. The\nancient wisdom of the human race will not be displaced by what happened in\nGalilee. On the contrary, Indian philosophy streams back to Europe, and\nwill produce a fundamental change in our knowledge and thought.\n\u00a7 64. From our exposition of eternal justice, which is not mythical but\nphilosophical, we will now proceed to the kindred investigation of the\nethical significance of conduct and of conscience, which is the merely\nfelt knowledge of that significance. But first I wish at this point to\ndraw attention to two peculiarities of human nature, that might help to\nmake clear how the nature of that eternal justice, and the unity and\nidentity of the will in all its phenomena upon which it rests, is known to\nevery one, at least as an obscure feeling.\nWhen a bad deed has been done, it affords satisfaction not only to the\nsufferer, who for the most part feels the desire of revenge, but also to\nthe perfectly indifferent spectator, to see that he who caused another\npain suffers himself a like measure of pain; and this quite independently\nof the end which we have shown the state has in view in punishment, and\nwhich is the foundation of penal law. It seems to me that what expresses\nitself here is nothing but the consciousness of that eternal justice,\nwhich is, nevertheless, at once misunderstood and falsified by the\nunenlightened mind, for, involved in the _principium individuationis_, it\nproduces an amphiboly of the concepts and demands from the phenomenon what\nonly belongs to the thing in itself. It does not see how far in themselves\nthe offender and the offended are one, and that it is the same being\nwhich, not recognising itself in its own manifestation, bears both the\npain and the guilt, but it desires rather to see the pain also in the\nparticular individual to whom the guilt belongs. Therefore, most persons\nwould demand that a man who had a very high degree of wickedness which\nmight yet occur in many others, only not matched with other qualities such\nas are found in him, a man who also far surpassed others by extraordinary\nintellectual powers, and who inflicted unspeakable sufferings upon\nmillions of others\u2014for example, as a conqueror,\u2014most persons, I say, would\ndemand that such a man should at some time and in some place expiate all\nthese sufferings by a like amount of pain; for they do not recognise how\nin themselves the inflicter of suffering and the sufferers are one, and\nthat it is the same will through which the latter exist and live which\nalso appears in the former, and just through him attains to a distinct\nrevelation of its nature, and which likewise suffers both in the oppressed\nand the oppressor; and indeed in the latter in a greater measure, as the\nconsciousness has attained a higher degree of clearness and distinctness\nand the will has greater vehemence. But that the deeper knowledge, which\nis no longer involved in the _principium individuationis_, from which all\nvirtue and nobleness proceed, no longer retains the disposition which\ndemands requital, is shown by the Christian ethics, which absolutely\nforbids all requital of evil with evil, and allows eternal justice to\nproceed in the sphere of the thing-in-itself, which is different from that\nof the phenomenon. (\u201cVengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the\nLord,\u201d\u2014Rom. xii. 19.)\nA much more striking, but also a much rarer, characteristic of human\nnature, which expresses that desire to draw eternal justice into the\nprovince of experience, _i.e._, of individuality, and at the same time\nindicates a felt consciousness that, as I have expressed it above, the\nwill to live conducts at its own cost the great tragedy and comedy, and\nthat the same one will lives in all manifestations,\u2014such a characteristic,\nI say, is the following. We sometimes see a man so deeply moved by a great\ninjury which he has experienced, or, it may be, only witnessed, that he\ndeliberately and irretrievably stakes his own life in order to take\nvengeance on the perpetrator of that wrong. We see him seek for some\nmighty oppressor through long years, murder him at last, and then himself\ndie on the scaffold, as he had foreseen, and often, it may be, did not\nseek to avoid, for his life had value for him only as a means of\nvengeance. We find examples of this especially among the Spaniards.(78)\nIf, now, we consider the spirit of that desire for retribution carefully,\nwe find that it is very different from common revenge, which seeks to\nmitigate the suffering, endured by the sight of the suffering inflicted;\nindeed, we find that what it aims at deserves to be called, not so much\nrevenge as punishment. For in it there really lies the intention of an\neffect upon the future through the example, and that without any selfish\naim, either for the avenging person, for it costs him his life, or for a\nsociety which secures its own safety by laws. For that punishment is\ncarried out by individuals, not by the state, nor is it in fulfilment of a\nlaw, but, on the contrary, always concerns a deed which the state either\nwould not or could not punish, and the punishment of which it condemns. It\nseems to me that the indignation which carries such a man so far beyond\nthe limits of all self-love springs from the deepest consciousness that he\nhimself is the whole will to live, which appears in all beings through all\ntime, and that therefore the most distant future belongs to him just as\nthe present, and cannot be indifferent to him. Asserting this will, he yet\ndesires that in the drama which represents its nature no such fearful\nwrong shall ever appear again, and wishes to frighten ever future\nwrong-doer by the example of a vengeance against which there is no means\nof defence, since the avenger is not deterred by the fear of death. The\nwill to live, though still asserting itself, does not here depend any\nlonger upon the particular phenomenon, the individual, but comprehends the\nIdea of man, and wishes to keep its manifestation pure from such a fearful\nand shocking wrong. It is a rare, very significant, and even sublime trait\nof character through which the individual sacrifices himself by striving\nto make himself the arm of eternal justice, of the true nature of which he\nis yet ignorant.\n\u00a7 65. In all the preceding investigations of human action, we have been\nleading up to the final investigation, and have to a considerable extent\nlightened the task of raising to abstract and philosophical clearness, and\nexhibiting as a branch of our central thought that special ethical\nsignificance of action which in life is with perfect understanding denoted\nby the words _good_ and _bad_.\nFirst, however, I wish to trace back to their real meaning those\nconceptions of _good_ and _bad_ which have been treated by the\nphilosophical writers of the day, very extraordinarily, as simple\nconceptions, and thus incapable of analysis; so that the reader may not\nremain involved in the senseless delusion that they contain more than is\nactually the case, and express in and for themselves all that is here\nnecessary. I am in a position to do this because in ethics I am no more\ndisposed to take refuge behind the word _good_ than formerly behind the\nwords _beautiful_ and _true_, in order that by the adding a \u201cness,\u201d which\nat the present day is supposed to have a special \u03c3\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, and therefore\nto be of assistance in various cases, and by assuming an air of solemnity,\nI might induce the belief that by uttering three such words I had done\nmore than denote three very wide and abstract, and consequently empty\nconceptions, of very different origin and significance. Who is there,\nindeed, who has made himself acquainted with the books of our own day to\nwhom these three words, admirable as are the things to which they\noriginally refer, have not become an aversion after he has seen for the\nthousandth time how those who are least capable of thinking believe that\nthey have only to utter these three words with open mouth and the air of\nan intelligent sheep, in order to have spoken the greatest wisdom?\nThe explanation of the concept _true_ has already been given in the essay\non the principle of sufficient reason, chap. v. \u00a7 29 _et seq._ The content\nof the concept _beautiful_ found for the first time its proper explanation\nthrough the whole of the Third Book of the present work. We now wish to\ndiscover the significance of the concept _good_, which can be done with\nvery little trouble. This concept is essentially relative, and signifies\n_the conformity of an object to any definite effort of the will_.\nAccordingly everything that corresponds to the will in any of its\nexpressions and fulfils its end is thought through the concept _good_,\nhowever different such things may be in other respects. Thus we speak of\ngood eating, good roads, good weather, good weapons, good omens, and so\non; in short, we call everything good that is just as we wish it to be;\nand therefore that may be good in the eyes of one man which is just the\nreverse in those of another. The conception of the good divides itself\ninto two sub-species\u2014that of the direct and present satisfaction of any\nvolition, and that of its indirect satisfaction which has reference to the\nfuture, _i.e._, the agreeable and the useful. The conception of the\nopposite, so long as we are speaking of unconscious existence, is\nexpressed by the word _bad_, more rarely and abstractly by the word\n_evil_, which thus denotes everything that does not correspond to any\neffort of the will. Like all other things that can come into relation to\nthe will, men who are favourable to the ends which happen to be desired,\nwho further and befriend them, are called good, in the same sense, and\nalways with that relative limitation, which shows itself, for example, in\nthe expression, \u201cI find this good, but you don\u2019t.\u201d Those, however, who are\nnaturally disposed not to hinder the endeavours of others, but rather to\nassist them, and who are thus consistently helpful, benevolent, friendly,\nand charitable, are called _good_ men, on account of this relation of\ntheir conduct to the will of others in general. In the case of conscious\nbeings (brutes and men) the contrary conception is denoted in German, and,\nwithin the last hundred years or so, in French also, by a different word\nfrom that which is used in speaking of unconscious existence; in German,\n_b\u00f6se_; in French, _m\u00e9chant_; while in almost all other languages this\ndistinction does not exist; and \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, _malus_, _cattivo_, _bad_, are used\nof men, as of lifeless things, which are opposed to the ends of a definite\nindividual will. Thus, having started entirely from the passive element in\nthe good, the inquiry could only proceed later to the active element, and\ninvestigate the conduct of the man who is called good, no longer with\nreference to others, but to himself; specially setting itself the task of\nexplaining both the purely objective respect which such conduct produces\nin others, and the peculiar contentment with himself which it clearly\nproduces in the man himself, since he purchases it with sacrifices of\nanother kind; and also, on the other hand, the inner pain which\naccompanies the bad disposition, whatever outward advantages it brings to\nhim who entertains it. It was from this source that the ethical systems,\nboth the philosophical and those which are supported by systems of\nreligion, took their rise. Both seek constantly in some way or other to\nconnect happiness with virtue, the former either by means of the principle\nof contradiction or that of sufficient reason, and thus to make happiness\neither identical with or the consequence of virtue, always sophistically;\nthe latter, by asserting the existence of other worlds than that which\nalone can be known to experience.(79) In our system, on the contrary,\nvirtue will show itself, not as a striving after happiness, that is,\nwell-being and life, but as an effort in quite an opposite direction.\nIt follows from what has been said above, that the _good_ is, according to\nits concept, \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9; thus every good is essentially relative, for its\nbeing consists in its relation to a desiring will. _Absolute good_ is,\ntherefore, a contradiction in terms; highest good, _summum bonum_, really\nsignifies the same thing\u2014a final satisfaction of the will, after which no\nnew desire could arise,\u2014a last motive, the attainment of which would\nafford enduring satisfaction of the will. But, according to the\ninvestigations which have already been conducted in this Fourth Book, such\na consummation is not even thinkable. The will can just as little cease\nfrom willing altogether on account of some particular satisfaction, as\ntime can end or begin; for it there is no such thing as a permanent\nfulfilment which shall completely and for ever satisfy its craving. It is\nthe vessel of the Danaides; for it there is no highest good, no absolute\ngood, but always a merely temporary good. If, however, we wish to give an\nhonorary position, as it were emeritus, to an old expression, which from\ncustom we do not like to discard altogether, we may, metaphorically and\nfiguratively, call the complete self-effacement and denial of the will,\nthe true absence of will, which alone for ever stills and silences its\nstruggle, alone gives that contentment which can never again be disturbed,\nalone redeems the world, and which we shall now soon consider at the close\nof our whole investigation\u2014the absolute good, the _summum bonum_\u2014and\nregard it as the only radical cure of the disease of which all other means\nare only palliations or anodynes. In this sense the Greek \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 and also\n_finis bonorum_ correspond to the thing still better. So much for the\nwords _good_ and _bad_; now for the thing itself.\nIf a man is always disposed to do _wrong_ whenever the opportunity\npresents itself, and there is no external power to restrain him, we call\nhim _bad_. According to our doctrine of wrong, this means that such a man\ndoes not merely assert the will to live as it appears in his own body, but\nin this assertion goes so far that he denies the will which appears in\nother individuals. This is shown by the fact that he desires their powers\nfor the service of his own will, and seeks to destroy their existence when\nthey stand in the way of its efforts. The ultimate source of this is a\nhigh degree of egoism, the nature of which has been already explained. Two\nthings are here apparent. In the first place, that in such a man an\nexcessively vehement will to live expresses itself, extending far beyond\nthe assertion of his own body; and, in the second place, that his\nknowledge, entirely given up to the principle of sufficient reason and\ninvolved in the _principium individuationis_, cannot get beyond the\ndifference which this latter principle establishes between his own person\nand every one else. Therefore he seeks his own well-being alone,\ncompletely indifferent to that of all others, whose existence is to him\naltogether foreign and divided from his own by a wide gulf, and who are\nindeed regarded by him as mere masks with no reality behind them. And\nthese two qualities are the constituent elements of the bad character.\nThis great intensity of will is in itself and directly a constant source\nof suffering. In the first place, because all volition as such arises from\nwant; that is, suffering. (Therefore, as will be remembered, from the\nThird Book, the momentary cessation of all volition, which takes place\nwhenever we give ourselves up to \u00e6sthetic contemplation, as pure will-less\nsubject of knowledge, the correlative of the Idea, is one of the principal\nelements in our pleasure in the beautiful.) Secondly, because, through the\ncausal connection of things, most of our desires must remain unfulfilled,\nand the will is oftener crossed than satisfied, and therefore much intense\nvolition carries with it much intense suffering. For all suffering is\nsimply unfulfilled and crossed volition; and even the pain of the body\nwhen it is injured or destroyed is as such only possible through the fact\nthat the body is nothing but the will itself become object. Now on this\naccount, because much intense suffering is inseparable from much intense\nvolition, very bad men bear the stamp of inward suffering in the very\nexpression of the countenance; even when they have attained every external\nhappiness, they always look unhappy so long as they are not transported by\nsome momentary ecstasy and are not dissembling. From this inward torment,\nwhich is absolutely and directly essential to them, there finally proceeds\nthat delight in the suffering of others which does not spring from mere\negoism, but is disinterested, and which constitutes _wickedness_ proper,\nrising to the pitch of _cruelty_. For this the suffering of others is not\na means for the attainment of the ends of its own will, but an end in\nitself. The more definite explanation of this phenomenon is as\nfollows:\u2014Since man is a manifestation of will illuminated by the clearest\nknowledge, he is always contrasting the actual and felt satisfaction of\nhis will with the merely possible satisfaction of it which knowledge\npresents to him. Hence arises envy: every privation is infinitely\nincreased by the enjoyment of others, and relieved by the knowledge that\nothers also suffer the same privation. Those ills which are common to all\nand inseparable from human life trouble us little, just as those which\nbelong to the climate, to the whole country. The recollection of greater\nsufferings than our own stills our pain; the sight of the sufferings of\nothers soothes our own. If, now, a man is filled with an exceptionally\nintense pressure of will,\u2014if with burning eagerness he seeks to accumulate\neverything to slake the thirst of his egoism, and thus experiences, as he\ninevitably must, that all satisfaction is merely apparent, that the\nattained end never fulfils the promise of the desired object, the final\nappeasing of the fierce pressure of will, but that when fulfilled the wish\nonly changes its form, and now torments him in a new one; and indeed that\nif at last all wishes are exhausted, the pressure of will itself remains\nwithout any conscious motive, and makes itself known to him with fearful\npain as a feeling of terrible desolation and emptiness; if from all this,\nwhich in the case of the ordinary degrees of volition is only felt in a\nsmall measure, and only produces the ordinary degree of melancholy, in the\ncase of him who is a manifestation of will reaching the point of\nextraordinary wickedness, there necessarily springs an excessive inward\nmisery, an eternal unrest, an incurable pain; he seeks indirectly the\nalleviation which directly is denied him,\u2014seeks to mitigate his own\nsuffering by the sight of the suffering of others, which at the same time\nhe recognises as an expression of his power. The suffering of others now\nbecomes for him an end in itself, and is a spectacle in which he delights;\nand thus arises the phenomenon of pure cruelty, blood-thirstiness, which\nhistory exhibits so often in the Neros and Domitians, in the African Deis,\nin Robespierre, and the like.\nThe desire of revenge is closely related to wickedness. It recompenses\nevil with evil, not with reference to the future, which is the character\nof punishment, but merely on account of what has happened, what is past,\nas such, thus disinterestedly, not as a means, but as an end, in order to\nrevel in the torment which the avenger himself has inflicted on the\noffender. What distinguishes revenge from pure wickedness, and to some\nextent excuses it, is an appearance of justice. For if the same act, which\nis now revenge, were to be done legally, that is, according to a\npreviously determined and known rule, and in a society which had\nsanctioned this rule, it would be punishment, and thus justice.\nBesides the suffering which has been described, and which is inseparable\nfrom wickedness, because it springs from the same root, excessive\nvehemence of will, another specific pain quite different from this is\nconnected with wickedness, which is felt in the case of every bad action,\nwhether it be merely injustice proceeding from egoism or pure wickedness,\nand according to the length of its duration is called _the sting of\nconscience_ or _remorse_. Now, whoever remembers and has present in his\nmind the content of the preceding portion of this Fourth Book, and\nespecially the truth explained at the beginning of it, that life itself is\nalways assured to the will to live, as its mere copy or mirror, and also\nthe exposition of eternal justice, will find that the sting of conscience\ncan have no other meaning than the following, _i.e._, its content,\nabstractly expressed, is what follows, in which two parts are\ndistinguished, which again, however, entirely coincide, and must be\nthought as completely united.\nHowever closely the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2 may envelop the mind of the bad man,\n_i.e._, however firmly he may be involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_, according to which he regards his person as absolutely\ndifferent and separated by a wide gulf from all others, a knowledge to\nwhich he clings with all his might, as it alone suits and supports his\negoism, so that knowledge is almost always corrupted by will, yet there\narises in the inmost depths of his consciousness the secret presentiment\nthat such an order of things is only phenomenal, and that their real\nconstitution is quite different. He has a dim foreboding that, however\nmuch time and space may separate him from other individuals and the\ninnumerable miseries which they suffer, and even suffer through him, and\nmay represent them as quite foreign to him, yet in themselves, and apart\nfrom the idea and its forms, it is the one will to live appearing in them\nall, which here failing to recognise itself, turns its weapons against\nitself, and, by seeking increased happiness in one of its phenomena,\nimposes the greatest suffering upon another. He dimly sees that he, the\nbad man, is himself this whole will; that consequently he is not only the\ninflicter of pain but also the endurer of it, from whose suffering he is\nonly separated and exempted by an illusive dream, the form of which is\nspace and time, which, however, vanishes away; that he must in reality pay\nfor the pleasure with the pain, and that all suffering which he only knows\nas possible really concerns him as the will to live, inasmuch as the\npossible and actual, the near and the distant in time and space, are only\ndifferent for the knowledge of the individual, only by means of the\n_principium individuationis_, not in themselves. This is the truth which\nmythically, _i.e._, adapted to the principle of sufficient reason, and so\ntranslated into the form of the phenomenal, is expressed in the\ntransmigration of souls. Yet it has its purest expression, free from all\nforeign admixture, in that obscurely felt yet inconsolable misery called\nremorse. But this springs also from a second immediate knowledge, which is\nclosely bound to the first\u2014the knowledge of the strength with which the\nwill to live asserts itself in the wicked individual, which extends far\nbeyond his own individual phenomenon, to the absolute denial of the same\nwill appearing in other individuals. Consequently the inward horror of the\nwicked man at his own deed, which he himself tries to conceal, contains,\nbesides that presentment of the nothingness, the mere illusiveness of the\n_principium individuationis_, and of the distinction established by it\nbetween him and others; also the knowledge of the vehemence of his own\nwill, the intensity with which he has seized upon life and attached\nhimself closely to it, even that life whose terrible side he sees before\nhim in the misery of those who are oppressed by him, and with which he is\nyet so firmly united, that just on this account the greatest atrocity\nproceeds from him himself, as a means for the fuller assertion of his own\nwill. He recognises himself as the concentrated manifestation of the will\nto live, feels to what degree he is given up to life, and with it also to\ninnumerable sufferings which are essential to it, for it has infinite time\nand infinite space to abolish the distinction between the possible and the\nactual, and to change all the sufferings which as yet are merely _known_\nto him into sufferings he has _experienced_. The millions of years of\nconstant rebirth certainly exist, like the whole past and future, only in\nconception; occupied time, the form of the phenomenon of the will, is only\nthe present, and for the individual time is ever new: it seems to him\nalways as if he had newly come into being. For life is inseparable from\nthe will to live, and the only form of life is the present. Death (the\nrepetition of the comparison must be excused) is like the setting of the\nsun, which is only apparently swallowed up by the night, but in reality,\nitself the source of all light, burns without intermission, brings new\ndays to new worlds, is always rising and always setting. Beginning and end\nonly concern the individual through time, the form of the phenomenon for\nthe idea. Outside time lies only the will, Kant\u2019s thing-in-itself, and its\nadequate objectification, the Idea of Plato. Therefore suicide affords no\nescape; what every one in his inmost consciousness _wills_, that must he\n_be_; and what every one _is_, that he _wills_. Thus, besides the merely\nfelt knowledge of the illusiveness and nothingness of the forms of the\nidea which separate individuals, it is the self-knowledge of one\u2019s own\nwill and its degree that gives the sting to conscience. The course of life\ndraws the image of the empirical character, whose original is the\nintelligible character, and horrifies the wicked man by this image. He is\nhorrified all the same whether the image is depicted in large characters,\nso that the world shares his horror, or in such small ones that he alone\nsees it, for it only concerns him directly. The past would be a matter of\nindifference, and could not pain the conscience if the character did not\nfeel itself free from all time and unalterable by it, so long as it does\nnot deny itself. Therefore things which are long past still weigh on the\nconscience. The prayer, \u201cLead me not into temptation,\u201d means, \u201cLet me not\nsee what manner of person I am.\u201d In the might with which the bad man\nasserts life, and which exhibits itself to him in the sufferings which he\ninflicts on others, he measures how far he is from the surrender and\ndenial of that will, the only possible deliverance from the world and its\nmiseries. He sees how far he belongs to it, and how firmly he is bound to\nit; the _known_ suffering of others has no power to move him; he is given\nup to life and _felt_ suffering. It remains hidden whether this will ever\nbreak and overcome the vehemence of his will.\nThis exposition of the significance and inner nature of the _bad_, which\nas mere feeling, _i.e._, not as distinct, abstract knowledge, is the\ncontent of _remorse_, will gain distinctness and completeness by the\nsimilar consideration of the _good_ as a quality of human will, and\nfinally of absolute resignation and holiness, which proceeds from it when\nit has attained its highest grade. For opposites always throw light upon\neach other, and the day at once reveals both itself and the night, as\nSpinoza admirably remarks.\n\u00a7 66. A theory of morals without proof, that is, mere moralising, can\neffect nothing, because it does not act as a motive. A theory of morals\nwhich does act as a motive can do so only by working on self-love. But\nwhat springs from this source has no moral worth. It follows from this\nthat no genuine virtue can be produced through moral theory or abstract\nknowledge in general, but that such virtue must spring from that intuitive\nknowledge which recognises in the individuality of others the same nature\nas in our own.\nFor virtue certainly proceeds from knowledge, but not from the abstract\nknowledge that can be communicated through words. If it were so, virtue\ncould be taught, and by here expressing in abstract language its nature\nand the knowledge which lies at its foundation, we should make every one\nwho comprehends this even ethically better. But this is by no means the\ncase. On the contrary, ethical discourses and preaching will just as\nlittle produce a virtuous man as all the systems of \u00e6sthetics from\nAristotle downwards have succeeded in producing a poet. For the real inner\nnature of virtue the concept is unfruitful, just as it is in art, and it\nis only in a completely subordinate position that it can be of use as a\ntool in the elaboration and preserving of what has been ascertained and\ninferred by other means. _Velle non discitur._ Abstract dogmas are, in\nfact, without influence upon virtue, _i.e._, upon the goodness of the\ndisposition. False dogmas do not disturb it; true ones will scarcely\nassist it. It would, in fact, be a bad look-out if the cardinal fact in\nthe life of man, his ethical worth, that worth which counts for eternity,\nwere dependent upon anything the attainment of which is so much a matter\nof chance as is the case with dogmas, religious doctrines, and\nphilosophical theories. For morality dogmas have this value only: The man\nwho has become virtuous from knowledge of another kind, which is presently\nto be considered, possesses in them a scheme or formula according to which\nhe accounts to his own reason, for the most part fictitiously, for his\nnon-egoistical action, the nature of which it, _i.e._, he himself, does\nnot comprehend, and with which account he has accustomed it to be content.\nUpon conduct, outward action, dogmas may certainly exercise a powerful\ninfluence, as also custom and example (the last because the ordinary man\ndoes not trust his judgment, of the weakness of which he is conscious, but\nonly follows his own or some one else\u2019s experience), but the disposition\nis not altered in this way.(80) All abstract knowledge gives only motives;\nbut, as was shown above, motives can only alter the direction of the will,\nnot the will itself. All communicable knowledge, however, can only affect\nthe will as a motive. Thus when dogmas lead it, what the man really and in\ngeneral wills remains still the same. He has only received different\nthoughts as to the ways in which it is to be attained, and imaginary\nmotives guide him just like real ones. Therefore, for example, it is all\none, as regards his ethical worth, whether he gives large gifts to the\npoor, firmly persuaded that he will receive everything tenfold in a future\nlife, or expends the same sum on the improvement of an estate which will\nyield interest, certainly late, but all the more surely and largely. And\nhe who for the sake of orthodoxy commits the heretic to the flames is as\nmuch a murderer as the bandit who does it for gain; and indeed, as regards\ninward circumstances, so also was he who slaughtered the Turks in the Holy\nLand, if, like the burner of heretics, he really did so because he thought\nthat he would thereby gain a place in heaven. For these are careful only\nfor themselves, for their own egoism, just like the bandit, from whom they\nare only distinguished by the absurdity of their means. From without, as\nhas been said, the will can only be reached through motives, and these\nonly alter the way in which it expresses itself, never the will itself.\n_Velle non discitur._\nIn the case of good deeds, however, the doer of which appeals to dogmas,\nwe must always distinguish whether these dogmas really are the motives\nwhich lead to the good deeds, or whether, as was said above, they are\nmerely the illusive account of them with which he seeks to satisfy his own\nreason with regard to a good deed which really flows from quite a\ndifferent source, a deed which he does because he is good, though he does\nnot understand how to explain it rightly, and yet wishes to think\nsomething with regard to it. But this distinction is very hard to make,\nbecause it lies in the heart of a man. Therefore we can scarcely ever pass\na correct moral judgment on the action of others, and very seldom on our\nown. The deeds and conduct of an individual and of a nation may be very\nmuch modified through dogmas, example, and custom. But in themselves all\ndeeds (_opera operata_) are merely empty forms, and only the disposition\nwhich leads to them gives them moral significance. This disposition,\nhowever, may be quite the same when its outward manifestation is very\ndifferent. With an equal degree of wickedness, one man may die on the\nwheel, and another in the bosom of his family. It may be the same grade of\nwickedness which expresses itself in one nation in the coarse\ncharacteristics of murder and cannibalism, and in another finely and\nsoftly in miniature, in court intrigues, oppressions, and delicate plots\nof every kind; the inner nature remains the same. It is conceivable that a\nperfect state, or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believed doctrine\nof rewards and punishments after death, might prevent every crime;\npolitically much would be gained thereby; morally, nothing; only the\nexpression of the will in life would be restricted.\nThus genuine goodness of disposition, disinterested virtue, and pure\nnobility do not proceed from abstract knowledge. Yet they do proceed from\nknowledge; but it is a direct intuitive knowledge, which can neither be\nreasoned away, nor arrived at by reasoning, a knowledge which, just\nbecause it is not abstract, cannot be communicated, but must arise in each\nfor himself, which therefore finds its real and adequate expression not in\nwords, but only in deeds, in conduct, in the course of the life of man. We\nwho here seek the theory of virtue, and have therefore also to express\nabstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation, will\nyet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression. We can\nonly give the concept of this knowledge, and thus always start from action\nin which alone it becomes visible, and refer to action as its only\nadequate expression. We can only explain and interpret action, _i.e._,\nexpress abstractly what really takes place in it.\nBefore we speak of the _good_ proper, in opposition to the _bad_, which\nhas been explained, we must touch on an intermediate grade, the mere\nnegation of the bad: this is _justice_. The nature of right and wrong has\nbeen fully explained above; therefore we may briefly say here, that he who\nvoluntarily recognises and observes those merely moral limits between\nwrong and right, even where this is not secured by the state or any other\nexternal power, thus he who, according to our explanation, never carries\nthe assertion of his own will so far as to deny the will appearing in\nanother individual, is _just_. Thus, in order to increase his own\nwell-being, he will not inflict suffering upon others, _i.e._, he will\ncommit no crime, he will respect the rights and the property of others. We\nsee that for such a just man the _principium individuationis_ is no\nlonger, as in the case of the bad man, an absolute wall of partition. We\nsee that he does not, like the bad man, merely assert his own\nmanifestation of will and deny all others; that other persons are not for\nhim mere masks, whose nature is quite different from his own; but he shows\nin his conduct that he also recognises his own nature\u2014the will to live as\na thing-in-itself, in the foreign manifestation which is only given to him\nas idea. Thus he finds himself again in that other manifestation, up to a\ncertain point, that of doing no wrong, _i.e._, abstaining from injury. To\nthis extent, therefore, he sees through the _principium individuationis_,\nthe veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2; so far he sets the being external to him on a level with\nhis own\u2014he does it no injury.\nIf we examine the inmost nature of this justice, there already lies in it\nthe resolution not to go so far in the assertion of one\u2019s own will as to\ndeny the manifestations of will of others, by compelling them to serve\none\u2019s own. One will therefore wish to render to others as much as one\nreceives from them. The highest degree of this justice of disposition,\nwhich is, however, always united with goodness proper, whose character is\nno longer merely negative, extends so far that a man doubts his right to\ninherited property, wishes to support his body only by his own powers,\nmental and physical, feels every service of others and every luxury a\nreproach, and finally embraces voluntary poverty. Thus we see how Pascal,\nwhen he became an ascetic, would no longer permit any services to be\nrendered him, although he had servants enough; in spite of his constant\nbad health he made his bed himself, brought his own food from the kitchen,\n&c. (\u201cVie de Pascal, par sa S\u0153ur,\u201d p. 19). Quite in keeping with this, it\nis reported that many Hindus, even Rajas with great wealth, expend it\nmerely on the maintenance of their position, their court and attendants,\nand themselves observe with the greatest scrupulousness the maxim that a\nman should eat nothing that he has not himself both sowed and reaped. Yet\na certain misunderstanding lies at the bottom of this; for one man, just\nbecause he is rich and powerful, can render such signal services to the\nwhole of human society that they counterbalance the wealth he has\ninherited, for the secure possession of which he is indebted to society.\nIn reality that excessive justice of such Hindus is already more than\njustice; it is actual renunciation, denial of the will to\nlive,\u2014asceticism, of which we shall speak last. On the other hand, pure\nidleness and living through the exertions of others, in the case of\ninherited wealth, without accomplishing anything, may be regarded as\nmorally wrong, even if it must remain right according to positive laws.\nWe have found that voluntary justice has its inmost source in a certain\ndegree of penetration of the _principium individuationis_, while the\nunjust remain entirely involved in this principle. This penetration may\nexist not only in the degree which is required for justice, but also in\nthe higher degree which leads to benevolence and well-doing, to love of\nmankind. And this may take place however strong and energetic in itself\nthe will which appears in such an individual may be. Knowledge can always\ncounterbalance it in him, teach him to resist the tendency to wrong, and\neven produce in him every degree of goodness, and indeed of resignation.\nThus the good man is by no means to be regarded as originally a weaker\nmanifestation of will than the bad man, but it is knowledge which in him\nmasters the blind striving of will. There are certainly individuals who\nmerely seem to have a good disposition on account of the weakness of the\nwill appearing in them, but what they are soon appears from the fact that\nthey are not capable of any remarkable self-conquest in order to perform a\njust or good deed.\nIf, however, as a rare exception, we meet a man who possesses a\nconsiderable income, but uses very little of it for himself and gives all\nthe rest to the poor, while he denies himself many pleasures and comforts,\nand we seek to explain the action of this man, we shall find, apart\naltogether from the dogmas through which he tries to make his action\nintelligible to his reason, that the simplest general expression and the\nessential character of his conduct is that _he makes less distinction than\nis usually made between himself and others_. This distinction is so great\nin the eyes of many that the suffering of others is a direct pleasure to\nthe wicked and a welcome means of happiness to the unjust. The merely just\nman is content not to cause it; and, in general, most men know and are\nacquainted with innumerable sufferings of others in their vicinity, but do\nnot determine to mitigate them, because to do so would involve some\nself-denial on their part. Thus, in each of all these a strong distinction\nseems to prevail between his own ego and that of others; on the other\nhand, to the noble man we have imagined, this distinction is not so\nsignificant. The _principium individuationis_, the form of the phenomenon,\nno longer holds him so tightly in its grasp, but the suffering which he\nsees in others touches him almost as closely as his own. He therefore\ntries to strike a balance between them, denies himself pleasures,\npractises renunciation, in order to mitigate the sufferings of others. He\nsees that the distinction between himself and others, which to the bad man\nis so great a gulf, only belongs to a fleeting and illusive phenomenon. He\nrecognises directly and without reasoning that the in-itself of his own\nmanifestation is also that of others, the will to live, which constitutes\nthe inner nature of everything and lives in all; indeed, that this applies\nalso to the brutes and the whole of nature, and therefore he will not\ncause suffering even to a brute.(81)\nHe is now just as little likely to allow others to starve, while he\nhimself has enough and to spare, as any one would be to suffer hunger one\nday in order to have more the next day than he could enjoy. For to him who\ndoes works of love the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2 has become transparent, the illusion\nof the _principium individuationis_ has left him. He recognises himself,\nhis will, in every being, and consequently also in the sufferer. He is now\nfree from the perversity with which the will to live, not recognising\nitself, here in one individual enjoys a fleeting and precarious pleasure,\nand there in another pays for it with suffering and starvation, and thus\nboth inflicts and endures misery, not knowing that, like Thyestes, it\neagerly devours its own flesh; and then, on the one hand, laments its\nundeserved suffering, and on the other hand transgresses without fear of\nNemesis, always merely because, involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_, thus generally in the kind of knowledge which is\ngoverned by the principle of sufficient reason, it does not recognise\nitself in the foreign phenomenon, and therefore does not perceive eternal\njustice. To be cured of this illusion and deception of M\u00e2y\u00e2, and to do\nworks of love, are one and the same. But the latter is the necessary and\ninevitable symptom of that knowledge.\nThe opposite of the sting of conscience, the origin and significance of\nwhich is explained above, is the _good conscience_, the satisfaction which\nwe experience after every disinterested deed. It arises from the fact that\nsuch a deed, as it proceeds from the direct recognition of our own inner\nbeing in the phenomenon of another, affords us also the verification of\nthis knowledge, the knowledge that our true self exists not only in our\nown person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives.\nBy this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egoism it is contracted.\nFor as the latter concentrates our interest upon the particular\nmanifestation of our own individuality, upon which knowledge always\npresents to us the innumerable dangers which constantly threaten this\nmanifestation, and anxiety and care becomes the key-note of our\ndisposition; the knowledge that everything living is just as much our own\ninner nature, as is our own person, extends our interest to everything\nliving; and in this way the heart is enlarged. Thus through the diminished\ninterest in our own self, the anxious care for the self is attacked at its\nvery root and limited; hence the peace, the unbroken serenity, which a\nvirtuous disposition and a good conscience affords, and the more distinct\nappearance of this with every good deed, for it proves to ourselves the\ndepth of that disposition. The egoist feels himself surrounded by strange\nand hostile individuals, and all his hope is centred in his own good. The\ngood man lives in a world of friendly individuals, the well-being of any\nof whom he regards as his own. Therefore, although the knowledge of the\nlot of mankind generally does not make his disposition a joyful one, yet\nthe permanent knowledge of his own nature in all living beings, gives him\na certain evenness, and even serenity of disposition. For the interest\nwhich is extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety\nas that which is concentrated upon one. The accidents which concern\nindividuals collectively, equalise themselves, while those which happen to\nthe particular individual constitute good or bad fortune.\nThus, though others have set up moral principles which they give out as\nprescriptions for virtue, and laws which it was necessary to follow, I, as\nhas already been said, cannot do this because I have no \u201cought\u201d or law to\nprescribe to the eternally free-will. Yet on the other hand, in the\nconnection of my system, what to a certain extent corresponds and is\nanalogous to that undertaking is the purely theoretical truth, of which my\nwhole exposition may be regarded as merely an elaboration, that the will\nis the in-itself of every phenomenon but itself, as such, is free from the\nforms of the phenomenal, and consequently from multiplicity; a truth,\nwhich, with reference to action, I do not know how to express better than\nby the formula of the Vedas already quoted: \u201cTat twam asi!\u201d (This thou\nart!) Whoever is able to say this to himself, with regard to every being\nwith whom he comes in contact, with clear knowledge and firm inward\nconviction, is certain of all virtue and blessedness, and is on the direct\nroad to salvation.\nBut before I go further, and, as the conclusion of my exposition, show how\nlove, the origin and nature of which we recognised as the penetration of\nthe _principium individuationis_, leads to salvation, to the entire\nsurrender of the will to live, _i.e._, of all volition, and also how\nanother path, less soft but more frequented, leads men to the same goal, a\nparadoxical proposition must first be stated and explained; not because it\nis paradoxical, but because it is true, and is necessary to the\ncompleteness of the thought I have present. It is this: \u201cAll love (\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7,\n_caritas_) is sympathy.\u201d\n\u00a7 67. We have seen how justice proceeds from the penetration of the\n_principium individuationis_ in a less degree, and how from its\npenetration in a higher degree there arises goodness of disposition\nproper, which shows itself as pure, _i.e._, disinterested love towards\nothers. When now the latter becomes perfect, it places other individuals\nand their fate completely on a level with itself and its own fate. Further\nthan this it cannot go, for there exists no reason for preferring the\nindividuality of another to its own. Yet the number of other individuals\nwhose whole happiness or life is in danger may outweigh the regard for\none\u2019s own particular well-being. In such a case, the character that has\nattained to the highest goodness and perfect nobility will entirely\nsacrifice its own well-being, and even its life, for the well-being of\nmany others. So died Codrus, and Leonidas, and Regulus, and Decius Mus,\nand Arnold von Winkelried; so dies every one who voluntarily and\nconsciously faces certain death for his friends or his country. And they\nalso stand on the same level who voluntarily submit to suffering and death\nfor maintaining what conduces and rightly belongs to the welfare of all\nmankind; that is, for maintaining universal and important truths and\ndestroying great errors. So died Socrates and Giordano Bruno, and so many\na hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hands of the\npriests.\nNow, however, I must remind the reader, with reference to the paradox\nstated above, that we found before that suffering is essential to life as\na whole, and inseparable from it. And that we saw that every wish proceeds\nfrom a need, from a want, from suffering, and that therefore every\nsatisfaction is only the removal of a pain, and brings no positive\nhappiness; that the joys certainly lie to the wish, presenting themselves\nas a positive good, but in truth they have only a negative nature, and are\nonly the end of an evil. Therefore what goodness, love, and nobleness do\nfor others, is always merely an alleviation of their suffering, and\nconsequently all that can influence them to good deeds and works of love,\nis simply the _knowledge of the suffering of others_, which is directly\nunderstood from their own suffering and placed on a level with it. But it\nfollows from this that pure love (\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7, _caritas_) is in its nature\nsympathy; whether the suffering it mitigates, to which every unsatisfied\nwish belongs, be great or small. Therefore we shall have no hesitation, in\ndirect contradiction to Kant, who will only recognise all true goodness\nand all virtue to be such, if it has proceeded from abstract reflection,\nand indeed from the conception of duty and of the categorical imperative,\nand explains felt sympathy as weakness, and by no means virtue, we shall\nhave no hesitation, I say, in direct contradiction to Kant, in saying: the\nmere concept is for genuine virtue just as unfruitful as it is for genuine\nart: all true and pure love is sympathy, and all love which is not\nsympathy is selfishness. \u0395\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 is selfishness, \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7 is sympathy.\nCombinations of the two frequently occur. Indeed genuine friendship is\nalways a mixture of selfishness and sympathy; the former lies in the\npleasure experienced in the presence of the friend, whose individuality\ncorresponds to our own, and this almost always constitutes the greatest\npart; sympathy shows itself in the sincere participation in his joy and\ngrief, and the disinterested sacrifices made in respect of the latter.\nThus Spinoza says: _Benevolentia nihil aliud est, quam cupiditas ex\ncommiseratione orta_ (Eth. iii. pr. 27, cor. 3, schol.) As a confirmation\nof our paradoxical proposition it may be observed that the tone and words\nof the language and caresses of pure love, entirely coincide with the\ntones of sympathy; and we may also remark in passing that in Italian\nsympathy and true love are denoted by the same word _piet\u00e0_.\nThis is also the place to explain one of the most striking peculiarities\nof human nature, _weeping_, which, like laughter, belongs to those\nqualities which distinguish man from the brutes. Weeping is by no means a\ndirect expression of pain, for it occurs where there is very little pain.\nIn my opinion, indeed, we never weep directly on account of the pain we\nexperience, but always merely on account of its repetition in reflection.\nWe pass from the felt pain, even when it is physical, to a mere idea of\nit, and then find our own state so deserving of sympathy that we are\nfirmly and sincerely convinced that if another were the sufferer, we would\nbe full of sympathy, and love to relieve him. But now we ourselves are the\nobject of our own sympathy; with the most benevolent disposition we are\nourselves most in need of help; we feel that we suffer more than we could\nsee another suffer; and in this very complex frame of mind, in which the\ndirectly felt suffering only comes to perception by a doubly circuitous\nroute, imagined as the suffering of another, sympathised with as such, and\nthen suddenly perceived again as directly our own,\u2014in this complex frame\nof mind, I say, Nature relieves itself through that remarkable physical\nconflict. _Weeping_ is accordingly _sympathy with our own selves_, or\nsympathy directed back on its source. It is therefore conditional upon the\ncapacity for love and sympathy, and also upon imagination. Therefore men\nwho are either hard-hearted or unimaginative do not weep easily, and\nweeping is even always regarded as a sign of a certain degree of goodness\nof character, and disarms anger, because it is felt that whoever can still\nweep, must necessarily always be capable of love, _i.e._, sympathy towards\nothers, for this enters in the manner described into the disposition that\nleads to weeping. The description which Petrarch gives of the rising of\nhis own tears, na\u00efvely and truly expressing his feeling, entirely agrees\nwith the explanation we have given\u2014\n\u201cI vo pensando: e nel pensar m\u2019 assale\n_Una piet\u00e0 si forte di me stesso_,\nChe mi conduce spesso,\nAd alto lagrimar, ch\u2019i non soleva.\u201d(82)\nWhat has been said is also confirmed by the fact that children who have\nbeen hurt generally do not cry till some one commiserates them; thus not\non account of the pain, but on account of the idea of it. When we are\nmoved to tears, not through our own suffering but through that of another,\nthis happens as follows. Either we vividly put ourselves in the place of\nthe sufferer by imagination, or see in his fate the lot of humanity as a\nwhole, and consequently, first of all, our own lot; and thus, in a very\nroundabout way, it is yet always about ourselves that we weep, sympathy\nwith ourselves which we feel. This seems to be the principal reason of the\nuniversal, and thus natural, weeping in the case of death. The mourner\ndoes not weep for his loss; he would be ashamed of such egotistical tears,\ninstead of which he is sometimes ashamed of not weeping. First of all he\ncertainly weeps for the fate of the dead, but he also weeps when, after\nlong, heavy, and incurable suffering, death was to this man a wished-for\ndeliverance. Thus, principally, he is seized with sympathy for the lot of\nall mankind, which is necessarily finite, so that every life, however\naspiring, and often rich in deeds, must be extinguished and become\nnothing. But in this lot of mankind the mourner sees first of all his own,\nand this all the more, the more closely he is related to him who has died,\nthus most of all if it is his father. Although to his father his life was\nmisery through age and sickness, and though his helplessness was a heavy\nburden to his son, yet that son weeps bitterly over the death of his\nfather for the reason which has been given.(83)\n\u00a7 68. After this digression about the identity of pure love and sympathy,\nthe final return of which upon our own individuality has, as its symptom,\nthe phenomenon of weeping, I now take up the thread of our discussion of\nthe ethical significance of action, in order to show how, from the same\nsource from which all goodness, love, virtue, and nobility of character\nspring, there finally arises that which I call the denial of the will to\nlive.\nWe saw before that hatred and wickedness are conditioned by egoism, and\negoism rests on the entanglement of knowledge in the _principium\nindividuationis_. Thus we found that the penetration of that _principium\nindividuationis_ is the source and the nature of justice, and when it is\ncarried further, even to its fullest extent, it is the source and nature\nof love and nobility of character. For this penetration alone, by\nabolishing the distinction between our own individuality and that of\nothers, renders possible and explains perfect goodness of disposition,\nextending to disinterested love and the most generous self-sacrifice for\nothers.\nIf, however, this penetration of the _principium individuationis_, this\ndirect knowledge of the identity of will in all its manifestations, is\npresent in a high degree of distinctness, it will at once show an\ninfluence upon the will which extends still further. If that veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2,\nthe _principium individuationis_, is lifted from the eyes of a man to such\nan extent that he no longer makes the egotistical distinction between his\nperson and that of others, but takes as much interest in the sufferings of\nother individuals as in his own, and therefore is not only benevolent in\nthe highest degree, but even ready to sacrifice his own individuality\nwhenever such a sacrifice will save a number of other persons, then it\nclearly follows that such a man, who recognises in all beings his own\ninmost and true self, must also regard the infinite suffering of all\nsuffering beings as his own, and take on himself the pain of the whole\nworld. No suffering is any longer strange to him. All the miseries of\nothers which he sees and is so seldom able to alleviate, all the miseries\nhe knows directly, and even those which he only knows as possible, work\nupon his mind like his own. It is no longer the changing joy and sorrow of\nhis own person that he has in view, as is the case with him who is still\ninvolved in egoism; but, since he sees through the _principium\nindividuationis_, all lies equally near him. He knows the whole,\ncomprehends its nature, and finds that it consists in a constant passing\naway, vain striving, inward conflict, and continual suffering. He sees\nwherever he looks suffering humanity, the suffering brute creation, and a\nworld that passes away. But all this now lies as near him as his own\nperson lies to the egoist. Why should he now, with such knowledge of the\nworld, assert this very life through constant acts of will, and thereby\nbind himself ever more closely to it, press it ever more firmly to\nhimself? Thus he who is still involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_, in egoism, only knows particular things and their\nrelation to his own person, and these constantly become new _motives_ of\nhis volition. But, on the other hand, that knowledge of the whole, of the\nnature of the thing-in-itself which has been described, becomes a\n_quieter_ of all and every volition. The will now turns away from life; it\nnow shudders at the pleasures in which it recognises the assertion of\nlife. Man now attains to the state of voluntary renunciation, resignation,\ntrue indifference, and perfect will-lessness. If at times, in the hard\nexperience of our own suffering, or in the vivid recognition of that of\nothers, the knowledge of the vanity and bitterness of life draws nigh to\nus also who are still wrapt in the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2, and we would like to\ndestroy the sting of the desires, close the entrance against all\nsuffering, and purify and sanctify ourselves by complete and final\nrenunciation; yet the illusion of the phenomenon soon entangles us again,\nand its motives influence the will anew; we cannot tear ourselves free.\nThe allurement of hope, the flattery of the present, the sweetness of\npleasure, the well-being which falls to our lot, amid the lamentations of\na suffering world governed by chance and error, draws us back to it and\nrivets our bonds anew. Therefore Jesus says: \u201cIt is easier for a camel to\ngo through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the\nkingdom of God.\u201d\nIf we compare life to a course or path through which we must unceasingly\nrun\u2014a path of red-hot coals, with a few cool places here and there; then\nhe who is entangled in delusion is consoled by the cool places, on which\nhe now stands, or which he sees near him, and sets out to run through the\ncourse. But he who sees through the _principium individuationis_, and\nrecognises the real nature of the thing-in-itself, and thus the whole, is\nno longer susceptible of such consolation; he sees himself in all places\nat once, and withdraws. His will turns round, no longer asserts its own\nnature, which is reflected in the phenomenon, but denies it. The\nphenomenon by which this change is marked, is the transition from virtue\nto asceticism. That is to say, it no longer suffices for such a man to\nlove others as himself, and to do as much for them as for himself; but\nthere arises within him a horror of the nature of which his own phenomenal\nexistence is an expression, the will to live, the kernel and inner nature\nof that world which is recognised as full of misery. He therefore disowns\nthis nature which appears in him, and is already expressed through his\nbody, and his action gives the lie to his phenomenal existence, and\nappears in open contradiction to it. Essentially nothing else but a\nmanifestation of will, he ceases to will anything, guards against\nattaching his will to anything, and seeks to confirm in himself the\ngreatest indifference to everything. His body, healthy and strong,\nexpresses through the genitals, the sexual impulse; but he denies the will\nand gives the lie to the body; he desires no sensual gratification under\nany condition. Voluntary and complete chastity is the first step in\nasceticism or the denial of the will to live. It thereby denies the\nassertion of the will which extends beyond the individual life, and gives\nthe assurance that with the life of this body, the will, whose\nmanifestation it is, ceases. Nature, always true and na\u00efve, declares that\nif this maxim became universal, the human race would die out; and I think\nI may assume, in accordance with what was said in the Second Book about\nthe connection of all manifestations of will, that with its highest\nmanifestation, the weaker reflection of it would also pass away, as the\ntwilight vanishes along with the full light. With the entire abolition of\nknowledge, the rest of the world would of itself vanish into nothing; for\nwithout a subject there is no object. I should like here to refer to a\npassage in the Vedas, where it is said: \u201cAs in this world hungry infants\npress round their mother; so do all beings await the holy oblation.\u201d\n(Asiatic Researches, vol. viii.; Colebrooke, On the Vedas, Abstract of the\nSama-Veda; also in Colebrooke\u2019s Miscellaneous Essays, vol. i. p. 79.)\nSacrifice means resignation generally, and the rest of nature must look\nfor its salvation to man who is at once the priest and the sacrifice.\nIndeed it deserves to be noticed as very remarkable, that this thought has\nalso been expressed by the admirable and unfathomably profound Angelus\nSilesius, in the little poem entitled, \u201cMan brings all to God;\u201d it runs,\n\u201cMan! all loves thee; around thee great is the throng. All things flee to\nthee that they may attain to God.\u201d But a yet greater mystic, Meister\nEckhard, whose wonderful writings are at last accessible (1857) through\nthe edition of Franz Pfeiffer, says the same thing (p. 459) quite in the\nsense explained here: \u201cI bear witness to the saying of Christ. I, if I be\nlifted up from the earth, will draw all things unto me (John xii. 32). So\nshall the good man draw all things up to God, to the source whence they\nfirst came. The Masters certify to us that all creatures are made for the\nsake of man. This is proved in all created things, by the fact that the\none makes the use of the other; the ox makes use of the grass, the fish of\nthe water, the bird of the air, the wild beast of the forest. Thus, all\ncreated things become of use to the good man. A good man brings to God the\none created thing in the other.\u201d He means to say, that man makes use of\nthe brutes in this life because, in and with himself, he saves them also.\nIt also seems to me that that difficult passage in the Bible, Rom. viii.\n21-24, must be interpreted in this sense.\nIn Buddhism also, there is no lack of expressions of this truth. For\nexample, when Buddha, still as Bodisatwa, has his horse saddled for the\nlast time, for his flight into the wilderness from his father\u2019s house, he\nsays these lines to the horse: \u201cLong hast thou existed in life and in\ndeath, but now thou shalt cease from carrying and drawing. Bear me but\nthis once more, O Kantakana, away from here, and when I have attained to\nthe Law (have become Buddha) I will not forget thee\u201d (Foe Koue Ki, trad.\np. Abel R\u00e9musat, p. 233).\nAsceticism then shows itself further in voluntary and intentional poverty,\nwhich not only arises _per accidens_, because the possessions are given\naway to mitigate the sufferings of others, but is here an end in itself,\nis meant to serve as a constant mortification of will, so that the\nsatisfaction of the wishes, the sweet of life, shall not again arouse the\nwill, against which self-knowledge has conceived a horror. He who has\nattained to this point, still always feels, as a living body, as concrete\nmanifestation of will, the natural disposition for every kind of volition;\nbut he intentionally suppresses it, for he compels himself to refrain from\ndoing all that he would like to do, and to do all that he would like not\nto do, even if this has no further end than that of serving as a\nmortification of will. Since he himself denies the will which appears in\nhis own person, he will not resist if another does the same, _i.e._,\ninflicts wrongs upon him. Therefore every suffering coming to him from\nwithout, through chance or the wickedness of others, is welcome to him,\nevery injury, ignominy, and insult; he receives them gladly as the\nopportunity of learning with certainty that he no longer asserts the will,\nbut gladly sides with every enemy of the manifestation of will which is\nhis own person. Therefore he bears such ignominy and suffering with\ninexhaustible patience and meekness, returns good for evil without\nostentation, and allows the fire of anger to rise within him just as\nlittle as that of the desires. And he mortifies not only the will itself,\nbut also its visible form, its objectivity, the body. He nourishes it\nsparingly, lest its excessive vigour and prosperity should animate and\nexcite more strongly the will, of which it is merely the expression and\nthe mirror. So he practises fasting, and even resorts to chastisement and\nself-inflicted torture, in order that, by constant privation and\nsuffering, he may more and more break down and destroy the will, which he\nrecognises and abhors as the source of his own suffering existence and\nthat of the world. If at last death comes, which puts an end to this\nmanifestation of that will, whose existence here has long since perished\nthrough free-denial of itself, with the exception of the weak residue of\nit which appears as the life of this body; it is most welcome, and is\ngladly received as a longed-for deliverance. Here it is not, as in the\ncase of others, merely the manifestation which ends with death; but the\ninner nature itself is abolished, which here existed only in the\nmanifestation, and that in a very weak degree;(84) this last slight bond\nis now broken. For him who thus ends, the world has ended also.\nAnd what I have here described with feeble tongue and only in general\nterms, is no philosophical fable, invented by myself, and only of to-day;\nno, it was the enviable life of so many saints and beautiful souls among\nChristians, and still more among Hindus and Buddhists, and also among the\nbelievers of other religions. However different were the dogmas impressed\non their reason, the same inward, direct, intuitive knowledge, from which\nalone all virtue and holiness proceed, expressed itself in precisely the\nsame way in the conduct of life. For here also the great distinction\nbetween intuitive and abstract knowledge shows itself; a distinction which\nis of such importance and universal application in our whole\ninvestigation, and which has hitherto been too little attended to. There\nis a wide gulf between the two, which can only be crossed by the aid of\nphilosophy, as regards the knowledge of the nature of the world.\nIntuitively or _in concreto_, every man is really conscious of all\nphilosophical truths, but to bring them to abstract knowledge, to\nreflection, is the work of philosophy, which neither ought nor is able to\ndo more than this.\nThus it may be that the inner nature of holiness, self-renunciation,\nmortification of our own will, asceticism, is here for the first time\nexpressed abstractly, and free from all mythical elements, as _denial of\nthe will to live_, appearing after the complete knowledge of its own\nnature has become a quieter of all volition. On the other hand, it has\nbeen known directly and realised in practice by saints and ascetics, who\nhad all the same inward knowledge, though they used very different\nlanguage with regard to it, according to the dogmas which their reason had\naccepted, and in consequence of which an Indian, a Christian, or a Lama\nsaint must each give a very different account of his conduct, which is,\nhowever, of no importance as regards the fact. A saint may be full of the\nabsurdest superstition, or, on the contrary, he may be a philosopher, it\nis all the same. His conduct alone certifies that he is a saint, for, in a\nmoral regard, it proceeds from knowledge of the world and its nature,\nwhich is not abstractly but intuitively and directly apprehended, and is\nonly expressed by him in any dogma for the satisfaction of his reason. It\nis therefore just as little needful that a saint should be a philosopher\nas that a philosopher should be a saint; just as it is not necessary that\na perfectly beautiful man should be a great sculptor, or that a great\nsculptor should himself be a beautiful man. In general, it is a strange\ndemand upon a moralist that he should teach no other virtue than that\nwhich he himself possesses. To repeat the whole nature of the world\nabstractly, universally, and distinctly in concepts, and thus to store up,\nas it were, a reflected image of it in permanent concepts always at the\ncommand of the reason; this and nothing else is philosophy. I refer the\nreader to the passage quoted from Bacon in the First Book.\nBut the description I have given above of the denial of the will to live,\nof the conduct of a beautiful soul, of a resigned and voluntarily\nexpiating saint, is merely abstract and general, and therefore cold. As\nthe knowledge from which the denial of the will proceeds is intuitive and\nnot abstract, it finds its most perfect expression, not in abstract\nconceptions, but in deeds and conduct. Therefore, in order to understand\nfully what we philosophically express as denial of the will to live, one\nmust come to know examples of it in experience and actual life. Certainly\nthey are not to be met with in daily experience: _Nam omnia pr\u00e6clara tam\ndifficilia quam rara sunt_, Spinoza admirably says. Therefore, unless by a\nspecially happy fate we are made eye-witnesses, we have to content\nourselves with descriptions of the lives of such men. Indian literature,\nas we see from the little that we as yet know through translations, is\nvery rich in descriptions of the lives of saints, penitents, Samanas or\nascetics, Sanny\u00e2sis or mendicants, and whatever else they may be called.\nEven the well-known \u201cMythologie des Indous, par Mad. de Polier,\u201d though by\nno means to be commended in every respect, contains many excellent\nexamples of this kind (especially in ch. 13, vol. ii.) Among Christians\nalso there is no lack of examples which afford us the illustrations we\ndesire. See the biographies, for the most part badly written, of those\npersons who are sometimes called saintly souls, sometimes pietists,\nquietists, devout enthusiasts, and so forth. Collections of such\nbiographies have been made at various times, such as Tersteegen\u2019s \u201cLeben\nheiliger Seelen,\u201d Reiz\u2019s \u201cGeschichte der Wiedergeborennen,\u201d in our own\nday, a collection by Kanne, which, with much that is bad, yet contains\nsome good, and especially the \u201cLeben der Beata Sturmin.\u201d To this category\nvery properly belongs the life of St. Francis of Assisi, that true\npersonification of the ascetic, and prototype of all mendicant friars. His\nlife, described by his younger contemporary, St. Bonaventura, also famous\nas a scholastic, has recently been republished. \u201cVita S. Francisci a S.\nBonaventura concinnata\u201d (Soest, 1847), though shortly before a painstaking\nand detailed biography, making use of all sources of information, appeared\nin France, \u201cHistoire de S. Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Assise, par Chavin de Mallan\u201d\n(1845). As an Oriental parallel of these monastic writings we have the\nvery valuable work of Spence Hardy, \u201cEastern Monachism; an Account of the\nOrder of Mendicants founded by Gotama Budha\u201d (1850). It shows us the same\nthing in another dress. We also see what a matter of indifference it is\nwhether it proceeds from a theistical or an atheistical religion. But as a\nspecial and exceedingly full example and practical illustration of the\nconceptions I have established, I can thoroughly recommend the\n\u201cAutobiography of Madame de Guion.\u201d To become acquainted with this great\nand beautiful soul, the very thought of whom always fills me with\nreverence, and to do justice to the excellence of her disposition while\nmaking allowance for the superstition of her reason, must be just as\ndelightful to every man of the better sort as with vulgar thinkers,\n_i.e._, the majority, that book will always stand in bad repute. For it is\nthe case with regard to everything, that each man can only prize that\nwhich to a certain extent is analogous to him and for which he has at\nleast a slight inclination. This holds good of ethical concerns as well as\nof intellectual. We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French\nbiography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that\nnoble introduction to his very insufficient essay, \u201cDe Emendatione\nIntellectus,\u201d a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual\nmeans I know of stilling the storm of the passions. Finally, even the\ngreat Goethe, Greek as he is, did not think it below his dignity to show\nus this most beautiful side of humanity in the magic mirror of poetic art,\nfor he represented the life of Fr\u00e4ulein Klettenberg in an idealised form\nin his \u201cConfessions of a Beautiful Soul,\u201d and later, in his own biography,\ngave us also an historical account of it. Besides this, he twice told the\nstory of the life of St. Philippo Neri. The history of the world, will,\nand indeed must, keep silence about the men whose conduct is the best and\nonly adequate illustration of this important point of our investigation,\nfor the material of the history of the world is quite different, and\nindeed opposed to this. It is not the denial of the will to live, but its\nassertion and its manifestation in innumerable individuals in which its\nconflict with itself at the highest grade of its objectification appears\nwith perfect distinctness, and brings before our eyes, now the ascendancy\nof the individual through prudence, now the might of the many through\ntheir mass, now the might of chance personified as fate, always the vanity\nand emptiness of the whole effort. We, however, do not follow here the\ncourse of phenomena in time, but, as philosophers, we seek to investigate\nthe ethical significance of action, and take this as the only criterion of\nwhat for us is significant and important. Thus we will not be withheld by\nany fear of the constant numerical superiority of vulgarity and dulness\nfrom acknowledging that the greatest, most important, and most significant\nphenomenon that the world can show is not the conqueror of the world, but\nthe subduer of it; is nothing but the quiet, unobserved life of a man who\nhas attained to the knowledge in consequence of which he surrenders and\ndenies that will to live which fills everything and strives and strains in\nall, and which first gains freedom here in him alone, so that his conduct\nbecomes the exact opposite of that of other men. In this respect,\ntherefore, for the philosopher, these accounts of the lives of holy,\nself-denying men, badly as they are generally written, and mixed as they\nare with superstition and nonsense, are, because of the significance of\nthe material, immeasurably more instructive and important than even\nPlutarch and Livy.\nIt will further assist us much in obtaining a more definite and full\nknowledge of what we have expressed abstractly and generally, according to\nour method of exposition, as the denial of the will to live, if we\nconsider the moral teaching that has been imparted with this intention,\nand by men who were full of this spirit; and this will also show how old\nour view is, though the pure philosophical expression of it may be quite\nnew. The teaching of this kind which lies nearest to hand is Christianity,\nthe ethics of which are entirely in the spirit indicated, and lead not\nonly to the highest degrees of human love, but also to renunciation. The\ngerm of this last side of it is certainly distinctly present in the\nwritings of the Apostles, but it was only fully developed and expressed\nlater. We find the Apostles enjoining the love of our neighbour as\nourselves, benevolence, the requital of hatred with love and well-doing,\npatience, meekness, the endurance of all possible injuries without\nresistance, abstemiousness in nourishment to keep down lust, resistance to\nsensual desire, if possible, altogether. We already see here the first\ndegrees of asceticism, or denial of the will proper. This last expression\ndenotes that which in the Gospels is called denying ourselves and taking\nup the cross (Matt. xvi. 24, 25; Mark viii. 34, 35; Luke ix. 23, 24, xiv.\n26, 27, 33). This tendency soon developed itself more and more, and was\nthe origin of hermits, anchorites, and monasticism\u2014an origin which in\nitself was pure and holy, but for that very reason unsuitable for the\ngreat majority of men; therefore what developed out of it could only be\nhypocrisy and wickedness, for _abusus optimi pessimus_. In more developed\nChristianity, we see that seed of asceticism unfold into the full flower\nin the writings of the Christian saints and mystics. These preach, besides\nthe purest love, complete resignation, voluntary and absolute poverty,\ngenuine calmness, perfect indifference to all worldly things, dying to our\nown will and being born again in God, entire forgetting of our own person,\nand sinking ourselves in the contemplation of God. A full exposition of\nthis will be found in F\u00e9n\u00e9lon\u2019s \u201cExplication des Maximes des Saints sur la\nVie Interieure.\u201d But the spirit of this development of Christianity is\ncertainly nowhere so fully and powerfully expressed as in the writings of\nthe German mystics, in the works of Meister Eckhard, and in that justly\nfamous book \u201cDie Deutsche Theologie,\u201d of which Luther says in the\nintroduction to it which he wrote, that with the exception of the Bible\nand St. Augustine, he had learnt more from it of what God, Christ, and man\nare than from any other book. Yet we only got the genuine and correct text\nof it in the year 1851, in the Stuttgart edition by Pfeiffer. The precepts\nand doctrines which are laid down there are the most perfect exposition,\nsprung from deep inward conviction of what I have presented as the denial\nof the will. It should therefore be studied more closely in that form\nbefore it is dogmatised about with Jewish-Protestant assurance. Tauler\u2019s\n\u201cNachfolgung des armen Leben Christi,\u201d and also his \u201cMedulla Anim\u00e6,\u201d are\nwritten in the same admirable spirit, though not quite equal in value to\nthat work. In my opinion the teaching of these genuine Christian mystics,\nwhen compared with the teaching of the New Testament, is as alcohol to\nwine, or what becomes visible in the New Testament as through a veil and\nmist appears to us in the works of the mystics without cloak or disguise,\nin full clearness and distinctness. Finally, the New Testament might be\nregarded as the first initiation, the mystics as the second,\u2014\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1.\nWe find, however, that which we have called the denial of the will to live\nmore fully developed, more variously expressed, and more vividly\nrepresented in the ancient Sanscrit writings than could be the case in the\nChristian Church and the Western world. That this important ethical view\nof life could here attain to a fuller development and a more distinct\nexpression is perhaps principally to be ascribed to the fact that it was\nnot confined by an element quite foreign to it, as Christianity is by the\nJewish theology, to which its sublime author had necessarily to adopt and\naccommodate it, partly consciously, partly, it may be, unconsciously. Thus\nChristianity is made up of two very different constituent parts, and I\nshould like to call the purely ethical part especially and indeed\nexclusively Christian, and distinguish it from the Jewish dogmatism with\nwhich it is combined. If, as has often been feared, and especially at the\npresent time, that excellent and salutary religion should altogether\ndecline, I should look for the reason of this simply in the fact that it\ndoes not consist of one single element, but of two originally different\nelements, which have only been combined through the accident of history.\nIn such a case dissolution had to follow through the separation of these\nelements, arising from their different relationship to and reaction\nagainst the progressive spirit of the age. But even after this dissolution\nthe purely ethical part must always remain uninjured, because it is\nindestructible. Our knowledge of Hindu literature is still very imperfect.\nYet, as we find their ethical teaching variously and powerfully expressed\nin the Vedas, Puranas, poems, myths, legends of their saints, maxims and\nprecepts,(85) we see that it inculcates love of our neighbour with\ncomplete renunciation of self-love; love generally, not confined to\nmankind, but including all living creatures; benevolence, even to the\ngiving away of the hard-won wages of daily toil; unlimited patience\ntowards all who injure us; the requital of all wickedness, however base,\nwith goodness and love; voluntary and glad endurance of all ignominy;\nabstinence from all animal food; perfect chastity and renunciation of all\nsensual pleasure for him who strives after true holiness; the surrender of\nall possessions, the forsaking of every dwelling-place and of all\nrelatives; deep unbroken solitude, spent in silent contemplation, with\nvoluntary penance and terrible slow self-torture for the absolute\nmortification of the will, torture which extends to voluntary death by\nstarvation, or by men giving themselves up to crocodiles, or flinging\nthemselves over the sacred precipice in the Himalayas, or being buried\nalive, or, finally, by flinging themselves under the wheels of the huge\ncar of an idol drawn along amid the singing, shouting, and dancing of\nbayaderes. And even yet these precepts, whose origin reaches back more\nthan four thousand years, are carried out in practice, in some cases even\nto the utmost extreme,(86) and this notwithstanding the fact that the\nHindu nation has been broken up into so many parts. A religion which\ndemands the greatest sacrifices, and which has yet remained so long in\npractice in a nation that embraces so many millions of persons, cannot be\nan arbitrarily invented superstition, but must have its foundation in the\nnature of man. But besides this, if we read the life of a Christian\npenitent or saint, and also that of a Hindu saint, we cannot sufficiently\nwonder at the harmony we find between them. In the case of such radically\ndifferent dogmas, customs, and circumstances, the inward life and effort\nof both is the same. And the same harmony prevails in the maxims\nprescribed for both of them. For example, Tauler speaks of the absolute\npoverty which one ought to seek, and which consists in giving away and\ndivesting oneself completely of everything from which one might draw\ncomfort or worldly pleasure, clearly because all this constantly affords\nnew nourishment to the will, which it is intended to destroy entirely. And\nas an Indian counterpart of this, we find in the precepts of Fo that the\nSaniassi, who ought to be without a dwelling and entirely without\nproperty, is further finally enjoined not to lay himself down often under\nthe same tree, lest he should acquire a preference or inclination for it\nabove other trees. The Christian mystic and the teacher of the Vedanta\nphilosophy agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works\nand religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to\nperfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and\nnations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as\noptimistic dulness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the\nmind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely\nbecause of its excellence.\nI have now indicated the sources from which there may be obtained a direct\nknowledge, drawn from life itself, of the phenomena in which the denial of\nthe will to live exhibits itself. In some respects this is the most\nimportant point of our whole work; yet I have only explained it quite\ngenerally, for it is better to refer to those who speak from direct\nexperience, than to increase the size of this book unduly by weak\nrepetitions of what is said by them.\nI only wish to add a little to the general indication of the nature of\nthis state. We saw above that the wicked man, by the vehemence of his\nvolition, suffers constant, consuming, inward pain, and finally, if all\nobjects of volition are exhausted, quenches the fiery thirst of his\nself-will by the sight of the suffering of others. He, on the contrary,\nwho has attained to the denial of the will to live, however poor, joyless,\nand full of privation his condition may appear when looked at externally,\nis yet filled with inward joy and the true peace of heaven. It is not the\nrestless strain of life, the jubilant delight which has keen suffering as\nits preceding or succeeding condition, in the experience of the man who\nloves life; but it is a peace that cannot be shaken, a deep rest and\ninward serenity, a state which we cannot behold without the greatest\nlonging when it is brought before our eyes or our imagination, because we\nat once recognise it as that which alone is right, infinitely surpassing\neverything else, upon which our better self cries within us the great\n_sapere aude_. Then we feel that every gratification of our wishes won\nfrom the world is merely like the alms which the beggar receives from life\nto-day that he may hunger again on the morrow; resignation, on the\ncontrary, is like an inherited estate, it frees the owner for ever from\nall care.\nIt will be remembered from the Third Book that the \u00e6sthetic pleasure in\nthe beautiful consists in great measure in the fact that in entering the\nstate of pure contemplation we are lifted for the moment above all\nwilling, _i.e._, all wishes and cares; we become, as it were, freed from\nourselves. We are no longer the individual whose knowledge is subordinated\nto the service of its constant willing, the correlative of the particular\nthing to which objects are motives, but the eternal subject of knowing\npurified from will, the correlative of the Platonic Idea. And we know that\nthese moments in which, delivered from the ardent strain of will, we seem\nto rise out of the heavy atmosphere of earth, are the happiest which we\nexperience. From this we can understand how blessed the life of a man must\nbe whose will is silenced, not merely for a moment, as in the enjoyment of\nthe beautiful, but for ever, indeed altogether extinguished, except as\nregards the last glimmering spark that retains the body in life, and will\nbe extinguished with its death. Such a man, who, after many bitter\nstruggles with his own nature, has finally conquered entirely, continues\nto exist only as a pure, knowing being, the undimmed mirror of the world.\nNothing can trouble him more, nothing can move him, for he has cut all the\nthousand cords of will which hold us bound to the world, and, as desire,\nfear, envy, anger, drag us hither and thither in constant pain. He now\nlooks back smiling and at rest on the delusions of this world, which once\nwere able to move and agonise his spirit also, but which now stand before\nhim as utterly indifferent to him, as the chess-men when the game is\nended, or as, in the morning, the cast-off masquerading dress which\nworried and disquieted us in a night in Carnival. Life and its forms now\npass before him as a fleeting illusion, as a light morning dream before\nhalf-waking eyes, the real world already shining through it so that it can\nno longer deceive; and like this morning dream, they finally vanish\naltogether without any violent transition. From this we can understand the\nmeaning of Madame Guion when towards the end of her autobiography she\noften expresses herself thus: \u201cEverything is alike to me; I _cannot_ will\nanything more: often I know not whether I exist or not.\u201d In order to\nexpress how, after the extinction of the will, the death of the body\n(which is indeed only the manifestation of the will, and therefore loses\nall significance when the will is abolished) can no longer have any\nbitterness, but is very welcome, I may be allowed to quote the words of\nthat holy penitent, although they are not very elegantly turned: \u201c_Midi de\nla gloire; jour o\u00f9 il n\u2019y a plus de nuit; vie qui ne craint plus la mort,\ndans la mort m\u00eame: parceque la mort a vaincu la mort, et que celui qui a\nsouffert la premi\u00e8re mort, ne goutera plus la seconde mort_\u201d (Vie de Mad.\nde Guion, vol. ii. p. 13).\nWe must not, however, suppose that when, by means of the knowledge which\nacts as a quieter of will, the denial of the will to live has once\nappeared, it never wavers or vacillates, and that we can rest upon it as\non an assured possession. Rather, it must ever anew be attained by a\nconstant battle. For since the body is the will itself only in the form of\nobjectivity or as manifestation in the world as idea, so long as the body\nlives, the whole will to live exists potentially, and constantly strives\nto become actual, and to burn again with all its ardour. Therefore that\npeace and blessedness in the life of holy men which we have described is\nonly found as the flower which proceeds from the constant victory over the\nwill, and the ground in which it grows is the constant battle with the\nwill to live, for no one can have lasting peace upon earth. We therefore\nsee the histories of the inner life of saints full of spiritual conflicts,\ntemptations, and absence of grace, _i.e._, the kind of knowledge which\nmakes all motives ineffectual, and as an universal quieter silences all\nvolition, gives the deepest peace and opens the door of freedom. Therefore\nalso we see those who have once attained to the denial of the will to live\nstrive with all their might to keep upon this path, by enforced\nrenunciation of every kind, by penance and severity of life, and by\nselecting whatever is disagreeable to them, all in order to suppress the\nwill, which is constantly springing up anew. Hence, finally, because they\nalready know the value of salvation, their anxious carefulness to retain\nthe hard-won blessing, their scruples of conscience about every innocent\npleasure, or about every little excitement of their vanity, which here\nalso dies last, the most immovable, the most active, and the most foolish\nof all the inclinations of man. By the term _asceticism_, which I have\nused so often, I mean in its narrower sense this _intentional_ breaking of\nthe will by the refusal of what is agreeable and the selection of what is\ndisagreeable, the voluntarily chosen life of penance and self-chastisement\nfor the continual mortification of the will.\nWe see this practised by him who has attained to the denial of the will in\norder to enable him to persist in it; but suffering in general, as it is\ninflicted by fate, is a second way (\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2(87)) of attaining to\nthat denial. Indeed, we may assume that most men only attain to it in this\nway, and that it is the suffering which is personally experienced, not\nthat which is merely known, which most frequently produces complete\nresignation, often only at the approach of death. For only in the case of\na few is the mere knowledge which, seeing through the _principium\nindividuationis_, first produces perfect goodness of disposition and\nuniversal love of humanity, and finally enables them to regard all the\nsuffering of the world as their own; only in the case of a few, I say, is\nthis knowledge sufficient to bring about the denial of the will. Even with\nhim who approaches this point, it is almost invariably the case that the\ntolerable condition of his own body, the flattery of the moment, the\ndelusion of hope, and the satisfaction of the will, which is ever\npresenting itself anew, _i.e._, lust, is a constant hindrance to the\ndenial of the will, and a constant temptation to the renewed assertion of\nit. Therefore in this respect all these illusions have been personified as\nthe devil. Thus in most cases the will must be broken by great personal\nsuffering before its self-conquest appears. Then we see the man who has\npassed through all the increasing degrees of affliction with the most\nvehement resistance, and is finally brought to the verge of despair,\nsuddenly retire into himself, know himself and the world, change his whole\nnature, rise above himself and all suffering, as if purified and\nsanctified by it, in inviolable peace, blessedness, and sublimity,\nwillingly renounce everything he previously desired with all his might,\nand joyfully embrace death. It is the refined silver of the denial of the\nwill to live that suddenly comes forth from the purifying flame of\nsuffering. It is salvation. Sometimes we see even those who were very\nwicked purified to this degree by great grief; they have become new beings\nand are completely changed. Therefore their former misdeeds trouble their\nconsciences no more, yet they willingly atone for them by death, and\ngladly see the end of the manifestation of that will which is now foreign\nto them and abhorred by them. The great Goethe has given us a distinct and\nvisible representation of this denial of the will, brought about by great\nmisfortunes and despair of all deliverance, in his immortal masterpiece\n\u201cFaust,\u201d in the story of the sufferings of Gretchen. I know no parallel to\nthis in poetry. It is a perfect example of the second path that leads to\nthe denial of the will, not, as the first, through the mere knowledge of\nthe sufferings of a whole world which one has voluntarily acquired, but\nthrough excessive suffering experienced in one\u2019s own person. Many\ntragedies certainly end by conducting their strong-willed heroes to the\npoint of entire resignation, and then generally the will to live and its\nmanifestation end together, but no representation that is known to me\nbrings what is essential to that change so distinctly before us, free from\nall that is extraneous, as the part of \u201cFaust\u201d I have referred to.\nIn actual life we see that those unfortunate persons who have to drink to\nthe dregs the greatest cup of suffering, since when all hope is taken from\nthem they have to face with full consciousness a shameful, violent, and\noften painful death on the scaffold, are very frequently changed in this\nway. We must not indeed assume that there is so great a difference between\ntheir character and that of most men as their fate would seem to indicate,\nbut must attribute the latter for the most part to circumstances; yet they\nare guilty and to a considerable degree bad. We see, however, many of\nthem, when they have entirely lost hope, changed in the way referred to.\nThey now show actual goodness and purity of disposition, true abhorrence\nof doing any act in the least degree bad or unkind. They forgive their\nenemies, even if it is through them that they innocently suffer; and not\nwith words merely and a sort of hypocritical fear of the judges of the\nlower world, but in reality and with inward earnestness and no desire for\nrevenge. Indeed, their sufferings and death at last becomes dear to them,\nfor the denial of the will to live has appeared; they often decline the\ndeliverance when it is offered, and die gladly, peacefully, and happily.\nTo them the last secret of life has revealed itself in their excessive\npain; the secret that misery and wickedness, sorrow and hate, the sufferer\nand the inflicter of suffering, however different they may appear to the\nknowledge which follows the principle of sufficient reason, are in\nthemselves one, the manifestation of that one will to live which\nobjectifies its conflict with itself by means of the _principium\nindividuationis_. They have learned to know both sides in full measure,\nthe badness and the misery; and since at last they see the identity of the\ntwo, they reject them both at once; they deny the will to live. In what\nmyths and dogmas they account to their reason for this intuitive and\ndirect knowledge and for their own change is, as has been said, a matter\nof no importance.\nMatthias Claudius must without doubt have witnessed a change of mind of\nthis description when he wrote the remarkable essay in the \u201cWandsbecker\nBoten\u201d (pt. i. p. 115) with the title \u201cBekehrungsgeschichte des ***\u201d\n(\u201cHistory of the Conversion of ***\u201d), which concludes thus: \u201cMan\u2019s way of\nthinking may pass from one point of the periphery to the opposite point,\nand again back to the former point, if circumstances mark out for him the\npath. And these changes in a man are really nothing great or interesting,\nbut that _remarkable, catholic, transcendental change_ in which the whole\ncircle is irreparably broken up and all the laws of psychology become vain\nand empty when the coat is stripped from the shoulders, or at least turned\noutside in, and as it were scales fall from a man\u2019s eyes, is such that\nevery one who has breath in his nostrils forsakes father and mother if he\ncan hear or experience something certain about it.\u201d\nThe approach of death and hopelessness are in other respects not\nabsolutely necessary for such a purification through suffering. Even\nwithout them the knowledge of the contradiction of the will to live with\nitself can, through great misfortune and pain, force an entrance, and the\nvanity of all striving become recognised. Hence it has often happened that\nmen who have led a very restless life in the full strain of the passions,\nkings, heroes, and adventurers, suddenly change, betake themselves to\nresignation and penance, become hermits or monks. To this class belong all\ntrue accounts of conversions; for example, that of Raymond Lully, who had\nlong wooed a fair lady, and was at last admitted to her chamber,\nanticipating the fulfilment of all his wishes, when she, opening her\nbodice, showed him her bosom frightfully eaten with cancer. From that\nmoment, as if he had looked into hell, he was changed; he forsook the\ncourt of the king of Majorca, and went into the desert to do penance.(88)\nThis conversion is very like that of the Abb\u00e9 Ranc\u00e9, which I have briefly\nrelated in the 48th chapter of the Supplement. If we consider how in both\ncases the transition from the pleasure to the horror of life was the\noccasion of it, this throws some light upon the remarkable fact that it is\namong the French, the most cheerful, gay, sensuous, and frivolous nation\nin Europe, that by far the strictest of all monastic orders, the\nTrappists, arose, was re-established by Ranc\u00e9 after its fall, and has\nmaintained itself to the present day in all its purity and strictness, in\nspite of revolutions, Church reformations, and encroachments of\ninfidelity.\nBut a knowledge such as that referred to above of the nature of this\nexistence may leave us again along with the occasion of it and the will to\nlive, and with it the previous character may reappear. Thus we see that\nthe passionate Benvenuto Cellini was changed in this way, once when he was\nin prison, and again when very ill; but when the suffering passed over, he\nfell back again into his old state. In general, the denial of the will to\nlive by no means proceeds from suffering with the necessity of an effect\nfrom its cause, but the will remains free; for this is indeed the one\npoint at which its freedom appears directly in the phenomenon; hence the\nastonishment which Asmus expresses so strongly at the \u201ctranscendental\nchange.\u201d In the case of every suffering, it is always possible to conceive\na will which exceeds it in intensity and is therefore unconquered by it.\nThus Plato speaks in the \u201cPh\u00e6don\u201d of men who up to the moment of their\nexecution feast, drink, and indulge in sensuous pleasure, asserting life\neven to the death. Shakespeare shows us in Cardinal Beaufort the fearful\nend of a profligate, who dies full of despair, for no suffering or death\ncan break his will, which is vehement to the extreme of wickedness.(89)\nThe more intense the will is, the more glaring is the conflict of its\nmanifestation, and thus the greater is the suffering. A world which was\nthe manifestation of a far more intense will to live than this world\nmanifests would produce so much the greater suffering; would thus be a\nhell.\nAll suffering, since it is a mortification and a call to resignation, has\npotentially a sanctifying power. This is the explanation of the fact that\nevery great misfortune or deep pain inspires a certain awe. But the\nsufferer only really becomes an object of reverence when, surveying the\ncourse of his life as a chain of sorrows, or mourning some great and\nincurable misfortune, he does not really look at the special combination\nof circumstances which has plunged his own life into suffering, nor stops\nat the single great misfortune that has befallen him; for in so doing his\nknowledge still follows the principle of sufficient reason, and clings to\nthe particular phenomenon; he still wills life only not under the\nconditions which have happened to him; but only then, I say, he is truly\nworthy of reverence when he raises his glance from the particular to the\nuniversal, when he regards his suffering as merely an example of the\nwhole, and for him, since in a moral regard he partakes of genius, one\ncase stands for a thousand, so that the whole of life conceived as\nessentially suffering brings him to resignation. Therefore it inspires\nreverence when in Goethe\u2019s \u201cTorquato Tasso\u201d the princess speaks of how her\nown life and that of her relations has always been sad and joyless, and\nyet regards the matter from an entirely universal point of view.\nA very noble character we always imagine with a certain trace of quiet\nsadness, which is anything but a constant fretfulness at daily annoyances\n(this would be an ignoble trait, and lead us to fear a bad disposition),\nbut is a consciousness derived from knowledge of the vanity of all\npossessions, of the suffering of all life, not merely of his own. But such\nknowledge may primarily be awakened by the personal experience of\nsuffering, especially some one great sorrow, as a single unfulfilled wish\nbrought Petrarch to that state of resigned sadness concerning the whole of\nlife which appeals to us so pathetically in his works; for the Daphne he\npursued had to flee from his hands in order to leave him, instead of\nherself, the immortal laurel. When through some such great and irrevocable\ndenial of fate the will is to some extent broken, almost nothing else is\ndesired, and the character shows itself mild, just, noble, and resigned.\nWhen, finally, grief has no definite object, but extends itself over the\nwhole of life, then it is to a certain extent a going into itself, a\nwithdrawal, a gradual disappearance of the will, whose visible\nmanifestation, the body, it imperceptibly but surely undermines, so that a\nman feels a certain loosening of his bonds, a mild foretaste of that death\nwhich promises to be the abolition at once of the body and of the will.\nTherefore a secret pleasure accompanies this grief, and it is this, as I\nbelieve, which the most melancholy of all nations has called \u201cthe joy of\ngrief.\u201d But here also lies the danger of _sentimentality_, both in life\nitself and in the representation of it in poetry; when a man is always\nmourning and lamenting without courageously rising to resignation. In this\nway we lose both earth and heaven, and retain merely a watery\nsentimentality. Only if suffering assumes the form of pure knowledge, and\nthis, acting as a _quieter of the will_, brings about resignation, is it\nworthy of reverence. In this regard, however, we feel a certain respect at\nthe sight of every great sufferer which is akin to the feeling excited by\nvirtue and nobility of character, and also seems like a reproach of our\nown happy condition. We cannot help regarding every sorrow, both our own\nand those of others, as at least a potential advance towards virtue and\nholiness, and, on the contrary, pleasures and worldly satisfactions as a\nretrogression from them. This goes so far, that every man who endures a\ngreat bodily or mental suffering, indeed every one who merely performs\nsome physical labour which demands the greatest exertion, in the sweat of\nhis brow and with evident exhaustion, yet with patience and without\nmurmuring, every such man, I say, if we consider him with close attention,\nappears to us like a sick man who tries a painful cure, and who willingly,\nand even with satisfaction, endures the suffering it causes him, because\nhe knows that the more he suffers the more the cause of his disease is\naffected, and that therefore the present suffering is the measure of his\ncure.\nAccording to what has been said, the denial of the will to live, which is\njust what is called absolute, entire resignation, or holiness, always\nproceeds from that quieter of the will which the knowledge of its inner\nconflict and essential vanity, expressing themselves in the suffering of\nall living things, becomes. The difference, which we have represented as\ntwo paths, consists in whether that knowledge is called up by suffering\nwhich is merely and purely _known_, and is freely appropriated by means of\nthe penetration of the _principium individuationis_, or by suffering which\nis directly _felt_ by a man himself. True salvation, deliverance from life\nand suffering, cannot even be imagined without complete denial of the\nwill. Till then, every one is simply this will itself, whose manifestation\nis an ephemeral existence, a constantly vain and empty striving, and the\nworld full of suffering we have represented, to which all irrevocably and\nin like manner belong. For we found above that life is always assured to\nthe will to live, and its one real form is the present, from which they\ncan never escape, since birth and death reign in the phenomenal world. The\nIndian mythus expresses this by saying \u201cthey are born again.\u201d The great\nethical difference of character means this, that the bad man is infinitely\nfar from the attainment of the knowledge from which the denial of the will\nproceeds, and therefore he is in truth _actually_ exposed to all the\nmiseries which appear in life as _possible_; for even the present\nfortunate condition of his personality is merely a phenomenon produced by\nthe _principium individuationis_, and a delusion of M\u00e2y\u00e2, the happy dream\nof a beggar. The sufferings which in the vehemence and ardour of his will\nhe inflicts upon others are the measure of the suffering, the experience\nof which in his own person cannot break his will, and plainly lead it to\nthe denial of itself. All true and pure love, on the other hand, and even\nall free justice, proceed from the penetration of the _principium\nindividuationis_, which, if it appears with its full power, results in\nperfect sanctification and salvation, the phenomenon of which is the state\nof resignation described above, the unbroken peace which accompanies it,\nand the greatest delight in death.(90)\n\u00a7 69. Suicide, the actual doing away with the individual manifestation of\nwill, differs most widely from the denial of the will to live, which is\nthe single outstanding act of free-will in the manifestation, and is\ntherefore, as Asmus calls it, the transcendental change. This last has\nbeen fully considered in the course of our work. Far from being denial of\nthe will, suicide is a phenomenon of strong assertion of will; for the\nessence of negation lies in this, that the joys of life are shunned, not\nits sorrows. The suicide wills life, and is only dissatisfied with the\nconditions under which it has presented itself to him. He therefore by no\nmeans surrenders the will to live, but only life, in that he destroys the\nindividual manifestation. He wills life\u2014wills the unrestricted existence\nand assertion of the body; but the complication of circumstances does not\nallow this, and there results for him great suffering. The very will to\nlive finds itself so much hampered in this particular manifestation that\nit cannot put forth its energies. It therefore comes to such a\ndetermination as is in conformity with its own nature, which lies outside\nthe conditions of the principle of sufficient reason, and to which,\ntherefore, all particular manifestations are alike indifferent, inasmuch\nas it itself remains unaffected by all appearing and passing away, and is\nthe inner life of all things; for that firm inward assurance by reason of\nwhich we all live free from the constant dread of death, the assurance\nthat a phenomenal existence can never be wanting to the will, supports our\naction even in the case of suicide. Thus the will to live appears just as\nmuch in suicide (Siva) as in the satisfaction of self-preservation\n(Vishnu) and in the sensual pleasure of procreation (Brahma). This is the\ninner meaning of the unity of the Trimurtis, which is embodied in its\nentirety in every human being, though in time it raises now one, now\nanother, of its three heads. Suicide stands in the same relation to the\ndenial of the will as the individual thing does to the Idea. The suicide\ndenies only the individual, not the species. We have already seen that as\nlife is always assured to the will to live, and as sorrow is inseparable\nfrom life, suicide, the wilful destruction of the single phenomenal\nexistence, is a vain and foolish act; for the thing-in-itself remains\nunaffected by it, even as the rainbow endures however fast the drops which\nsupport it for the moment may change. But, more than this, it is also the\nmasterpiece of M\u00e2y\u00e2, as the most flagrant example of the contradiction of\nthe will to live with itself. As we found this contradiction in the case\nof the lowest manifestations of will, in the permanent struggle of all the\nforces of nature, and of all organic individuals for matter and time and\nspace; and as we saw this antagonism come ever more to the front with\nterrible distinctness in the ascending grades of the objectification of\nthe will, so at last in the highest grade, the Idea of man, it reaches the\npoint at which, not only the individuals which express the same Idea\nextirpate each other, but even the same individual declares war against\nitself. The vehemence with which it wills life, and revolts against what\nhinders it, namely, suffering, brings it to the point of destroying\nitself; so that the individual will, by its own act, puts an end to that\nbody which is merely its particular visible expression, rather than permit\nsuffering to break the will. Just because the suicide cannot give up\nwilling, he gives up living. The will asserts itself here even in putting\nan end to its own manifestation, because it can no longer assert itself\notherwise. As, however, it was just the suffering which it so shuns that\nwas able, as mortification of the will, to bring it to the denial of\nitself, and hence to freedom, so in this respect the suicide is like a\nsick man, who, after a painful operation which would entirely cure him has\nbeen begun, will not allow it to be completed, but prefers to retain his\ndisease. Suffering approaches and reveals itself as the possibility of the\ndenial of will; but the will rejects it, in that it destroys the body, the\nmanifestation of itself, in order that it may remain unbroken. This is the\nreason why almost all ethical teachers, whether philosophical or\nreligious, condemn suicide, although they themselves can only give\nfar-fetched sophistical reasons for their opinion. But if a human being\nwas ever restrained from committing suicide by purely moral motives, the\ninmost meaning of this self-conquest (in whatever ideas his reason may\nhave clothed it) was this: \u201cI will not shun suffering, in order that it\nmay help to put an end to the will to live, whose manifestation is so\nwretched, by so strengthening the knowledge of the real nature of the\nworld which is already beginning to dawn upon me, that it may become the\nfinal quieter of my will, and may free me for ever.\u201d\nIt is well known that from time to time cases occur in which the act of\nsuicide extends to the children. The father first kills the children he\nloves, and then himself. Now, if we consider that conscience, religion,\nand all influencing ideas teach him to look upon murder as the greatest of\ncrimes, and that, in spite of this, he yet commits it, in the hour of his\nown death, and when he is altogether uninfluenced by any egotistical\nmotive, such a deed can only be explained in the following manner: in this\ncase, the will of the individual, the father, recognises itself\nimmediately in the children, though involved in the delusion of mistaking\nthe appearance for the true nature; and as he is at the same time deeply\nimpressed with the knowledge of the misery of all life, he now thinks to\nput an end to the inner nature itself, along with the appearance, and thus\nseeks to deliver from existence and its misery both himself and his\nchildren, in whom he discerns himself as living again. It would be an\nerror precisely analogous to this to suppose that one may reach the same\nend as is attained through voluntary chastity by frustrating the aim of\nnature in fecundation; or indeed if, in consideration of the unendurable\nsuffering of life, parents were to use means for the destruction of their\nnew-born children, instead of doing everything possible to ensure life to\nthat which is struggling into it. For if the will to live is there, as it\nis the only metaphysical reality, or the thing-in-itself, no physical\nforce can break it, but can only destroy its manifestation at this place\nand time. It itself can never be transcended except through knowledge.\nThus the only way of salvation is, that the will shall manifest itself\nunrestrictedly, in order that in this individual manifestation it may come\nto apprehend its own nature. Only as the result of this knowledge can the\nwill transcend itself, and thereby end the suffering which is inseparable\nfrom its manifestation. It is quite impossible to accomplish this end by\nphysical force, as by destroying the germ, or by killing the new-born\nchild, or by committing suicide. Nature guides the will to the light, just\nbecause it is only in the light that it can work out its salvation.\nTherefore the aims of Nature are to be promoted in every way as soon as\nthe will to live, which is its inner being, has determined itself.\nThere is a species of suicide which seems to be quite distinct from the\ncommon kind, though its occurrence has perhaps not yet been fully\nestablished. It is starvation, voluntarily chosen on the ground of extreme\nasceticism. All instances of it, however, have been accompanied and\nobscured by much religious fanaticism, and even superstition. Yet it seems\nthat the absolute denial of will may reach the point at which the will\nshall be wanting to take the necessary nourishment for the support of the\nnatural life. This kind of suicide is so far from being the result of the\nwill to live, that such a completely resigned ascetic only ceases to live\nbecause he has already altogether ceased to will. No other death than that\nby starvation is in this case conceivable (unless it were the result of\nsome special superstition); for the intention to cut short the torment\nwould itself be a stage in the assertion of will. The dogmas which satisfy\nthe reason of such a penitent delude him with the idea that a being of a\nhigher nature has inculcated the fasting to which his own inner tendency\ndrives him. Old examples of this may be found in the \u201cBreslauer Sammlung\nvon Natur- und Medicin-Geschichten,\u201d September 1799, p. 363; in Bayle\u2019s\n\u201cNouvelles de la R\u00e9publique des Lettres,\u201d February 1685, p. 189; in\nZimmermann, \u201cUeber die Einsamkeit,\u201d vol. i. p. 182; in the \u201cHistoire de\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences\u201d for 1764, an account by Houttuyn, which is quoted\nin the \u201cSammlung f\u00fcr praktische Aerzte,\u201d vol. i. p. 69. More recent\naccounts may be found in Hufeland\u2019s \u201cJournal f\u00fcr praktische Heilkunde,\u201d\nvol. x. p. 181, and vol. xlviii. p. 95; also in Nasse\u2019s \u201cZeitschrift f\u00fcr\npsychische Aerzte,\u201d 1819, part iii. p. 460; and in the \u201cEdinburgh Medical\nand Surgical Journal,\u201d 1809, vol. v. p. 319. In the year 1833 all the\npapers announced that the English historian, Dr. Lingard, had died in\nJanuary at Dover of voluntary starvation; according to later accounts, it\nwas not he himself, but a relation of his who died. Still in these\naccounts the persons were generally described as insane, and it is no\nlonger possible to find out how far this was the case. But I will give\nhere a more recent case of this kind, if it were only to ensure the\npreservation of one of the rare instances of this striking and\nextraordinary phenomenon of human nature, which, to all appearance at any\nrate, belongs to the category to which I wish to assign it and could\nhardly be explained in any other way. This case is reported in the\n\u201cN\u00fcrnberger Correspondenten\u201d of the 29th July 1813, in these words:\u2014\u201cWe\nhear from Bern that in a thick wood near Thurnen a hut has been discovered\nin which was lying the body of a man who had been dead about a month. His\nclothes gave little or no clue to his social position. Two very fine\nshirts lay beside him. The most important article, however, was a Bible\ninterleaved with white paper, part of which had been written upon by the\ndeceased. In this writing he gives the date of his departure from home\n(but does not mention where his home was). He then says that he was driven\nby the Spirit of God into the wilderness to pray and fast. During his\njourney he had fasted seven days and then he had again taken food. After\nthis he had begun again to fast, and continued to do so for the same\nnumber of days as before. From this point we find each day marked with a\nstroke, and of these there are five, at the expiration of which the\npilgrim presumably died. There was further found a letter to a clergyman\nabout a sermon which the deceased heard him preach, but the letter was not\naddressed.\u201d Between this voluntary death arising from extreme asceticism\nand the common suicide resulting from despair there may be various\nintermediate species and combinations, though this is hard to find out.\nBut human nature has depths, obscurities, and perplexities, the analysis\nand elucidation of which is a matter of the very greatest difficulty.\n\u00a7 70. It might be supposed that the entire exposition (now terminated) of\nthat which I call the denial of the will is irreconcilable with the\nearlier explanation of necessity, which belongs just as much to motivation\nas to every other form of the principle of sufficient reason, and\naccording to which, motives, like all causes, are only occasional causes,\nupon which the character unfolds its nature and reveals it with the\nnecessity of a natural law, on account of which we absolutely denied\nfreedom as _liberum arbitrium indifferenti\u00e6_. But far from suppressing\nthis here, I would call it to mind. In truth, real freedom, _i.e._,\nindependence of the principle of sufficient reason, belongs to the will\nonly as a thing-in-itself, not to its manifestation, whose essential form\nis everywhere the principle of sufficient reason, the element or sphere of\nnecessity. But the one case in which that freedom can become directly\nvisible in the manifestation is that in which it makes an end of what\nmanifests itself, and because the mere manifestation, as a link in the\nchain of causes, the living body in time, which contains only phenomena,\nstill continues to exist, the will which manifests itself through this\nphenomenon then stands in contradiction to it, for it denies what the\nphenomenon expresses. In such a case the organs of generation, for\nexample, as the visible form of the sexual impulse, are there and in\nhealth; but yet, in the inmost consciousness, no sensual gratification is\ndesired; and although the whole body is only the visible expression of the\nwill to live, yet the motives which correspond to this will no longer act;\nindeed, the dissolution of the body, the end of the individual, and in\nthis way the greatest check to the natural will, is welcome and desired.\nNow, the contradiction between our assertions of the necessity of the\ndetermination of the will by motives, in accordance with the character, on\nthe one hand, and of the possibility of the entire suppression of the will\nwhereby the motives become powerless, on the other hand, is only the\nrepetition in the reflection of philosophy of this _real_ contradiction\nwhich arises from the direct encroachment of the freedom of the\nwill-in-itself, which knows no necessity, into the sphere of the necessity\nof its manifestation. But the key to the solution of these contradictions\nlies in the fact that the state in which the character is withdrawn from\nthe power of motives does not proceed directly from the will, but from a\nchanged form of knowledge. So long as the knowledge is merely that which\nis involved in the _principium individuationis_ and exclusively follows\nthe principle of sufficient reason, the strength of the motives is\nirresistible. But when the _principium individuationis_ is seen through,\nwhen the Ideas, and indeed the inner nature of the thing-in-itself, as the\nsame will in all, are directly recognised, and from this knowledge an\nuniversal quieter of volition arises, then the particular motives become\nineffective, because the kind of knowledge which corresponds to them is\nobscured and thrown into the background by quite another kind. Therefore\nthe character can never partially change, but must, with the consistency\nof a law of Nature, carry out in the particular the will which it\nmanifests as a whole. But this whole, the character itself, may be\ncompletely suppressed or abolished through the change of knowledge\nreferred to above. It is this suppression or abolition which Asmus, as\nquoted above, marvels at and denotes the \u201ccatholic, transcendental\nchange;\u201d and in the Christian Church it has very aptly been called the\n_new birth_, and the knowledge from which it springs, the _work of grace_.\nTherefore it is not a question of a change, but of an entire suppression\nof the character; and hence it arises that, however different the\ncharacters which experience the suppression may have been before it, after\nit they show a great similarity in their conduct, though every one still\nspeaks very differently according to his conceptions and dogmas.\nIn this sense, then, the old philosophical doctrine of the freedom of the\nwill, which has constantly been contested and constantly maintained, is\nnot without ground, and the dogma of the Church of the work of grace and\nthe new birth is not without meaning and significance. But we now\nunexpectedly see both united in one, and we can also now understand in\nwhat sense the excellent Malebranche could say, \u201c_La libert\u00e9 est un\nmyst\u00e8re_,\u201d and was right. For precisely what the Christian mystics call\n_the work of grace_ and _the new birth_, is for us the single direct\nexpression of _the freedom of the will_. It only appears if the will,\nhaving attained to a knowledge of its own real nature, receives from this\na _quieter_, by means of which the motives are deprived of their effect,\nwhich belongs to the province of another kind of knowledge, the objects of\nwhich are merely phenomena. The possibility of the freedom which thus\nexpresses itself is the greatest prerogative of man, which is for ever\nwanting to the brute, because the condition of it is the deliberation of\nreason, which enables him to survey the whole of life independent of the\nimpression of the present. The brute is entirely without the possibility\nof freedom, as, indeed, it is without the possibility of a proper or\ndeliberate choice following upon a completed conflict of motives, which\nfor this purpose would have to be abstract ideas. Therefore with the same\nnecessity with which the stone falls to the earth, the hungry wolf buries\nits fangs in the flesh of its prey, without the possibility of the\nknowledge that it is itself the destroyed as well as the destroyer.\n_Necessity is the kingdom of nature; freedom is the kingdom of grace._\nNow because, as we have seen, that _self-suppression of the will_ proceeds\nfrom knowledge, and all knowledge is involuntary, that denial of will\nalso, that entrance into freedom, cannot be forcibly attained to by\nintention or design, but proceeds from the inmost relation of knowing and\nvolition in the man, and therefore comes suddenly, as if spontaneously\nfrom without. This is why the Church has called it _the work of grace_;\nand that it still regards it as independent of the acceptance of grace\ncorresponds to the fact that the effect of the quieter is finally a free\nact of will. And because, in consequence of such a work of grace, the\nwhole nature of man is changed and reversed from its foundation, so that\nhe no longer wills anything of all that he previously willed so intensely,\nso that it is as if a new man actually took the place of the old, the\nChurch has called this consequence of the work of grace the _new birth_.\nFor what it calls the _natural man_, to which it denies all capacity for\ngood, is just the will to live, which must be denied if deliverance from\nan existence such as ours is to be attained. Behind our existence lies\nsomething else, which is only accessible to us if we have shaken off this\nworld.\nHaving regard, not to the individuals according to the principle of\nsufficient reason, but to the Idea of man in its unity, Christian theology\nsymbolises _nature_, the _assertion of the will to live_ in Adam, whose\nsin, inherited by us, _i.e._, our unity with him in the Idea, which is\nrepresented in time by the bond of procreation, makes us all partakers of\nsuffering and eternal death. On the other hand, it symbolises _grace_, the\n_denial of the will_, _salvation_, in the incarnate God, who, as free from\nall sin, that is, from all willing of life, cannot, like us, have\nproceeded from the most pronounced assertion of the will, nor can he, like\nus, have a body which is through and through simply concrete will,\nmanifestation of the will; but born of a pure virgin, he has only a\nphantom body. This last is the doctrine of the Docet\u00e6, _i.e._, certain\nChurch Fathers, who in this respect are very consistent. It is especially\ntaught by Apelles, against whom and his followers Tertullian wrote. But\neven Augustine comments thus on the passage, Rom. viii. 3, \u201cGod sent his\nSon in the likeness of sinful flesh:\u201d \u201c_Non enim caro peccati erat, qu\u00e6\nnon de carnali delectatione nata erat: sed tamen inerat ei similitudo\ncarnis peccati, quia mortalis caro erat_\u201d (Liber 83, _qu\u00e6st. qu._ 66). He\nalso teaches in his work entitled \u201c_Opus Imperfectum_,\u201d i. 47, that\ninherited sin is both sin and punishment at once. It is already present in\nnew-born children, but only shows itself if they grow up. Yet the origin\nof this sin is to be referred to the will of the sinner. This sinner was\nAdam, but we all existed in him; Adam became miserable, and in him we have\nall become miserable. Certainly the doctrine of original sin (assertion of\nthe will) and of salvation (denial of the will) is the great truth which\nconstitutes the essence of Christianity, while most of what remains is\nonly the clothing of it, the husk or accessories. Therefore Jesus Christ\nought always to be conceived in the universal, as the symbol or\npersonification of the denial of the will to live, but never as an\nindividual, whether according to his mythical history given in the\nGospels, or according to the probably true history which lies at the\nfoundation of this. For neither the one nor the other will easily satisfy\nus entirely. It is merely the vehicle of that conception for the people,\nwho always demand something actual. That in recent times Christianity has\nforgotten its true significance, and degenerated into dull optimism, does\nnot concern us here.\nIt is further an original and evangelical doctrine of Christianity\u2014which\nAugustine, with the consent of the leaders of the Church, defended against\nthe platitudes of the Pelagians, and which it was the principal aim of\nLuther\u2019s endeavour to purify from error and re-establish, as he expressly\ndeclares in his book, \u201c_De Servo Arbitrio_,\u201d\u2014the doctrine that _the will\nis not free_, but originally subject to the inclination to evil. Therefore\naccording to this doctrine the deeds of the will are always sinful and\nimperfect, and can never fully satisfy justice; and, finally, these works\ncan never save us, but faith alone, a faith which itself does not spring\nfrom resolution and free will, but from the work of grace, without our\nco-operation, comes to us as from without.\nNot only the dogmas referred to before, but also this last genuine\nevangelical dogma belongs to those which at the present day an ignorant\nand dull opinion rejects as absurd or hides. For, in spite of Augustine\nand Luther, it adheres to the vulgar Pelagianism, which the rationalism of\nthe day really is, and treats as antiquated those deeply significant\ndogmas which are peculiar and essential to Christianity in the strictest\nsense; while, on the other hand, it holds fast and regards as the\nprincipal matter only the dogma that originates in Judaism, and has been\nretained from it, and is merely historically connected with\nChristianity.(91) We, however, recognise in the doctrine referred to above\nthe truth completely agreeing with the result of our own investigations.\nWe see that true virtue and holiness of disposition have their origin not\nin deliberate choice (works), but in knowledge (faith); just as we have in\nlike manner developed it from our leading thought. If it were works, which\nspring from motives and deliberate intention, that led to salvation, then,\nhowever one may turn it, virtue would always be a prudent, methodical,\nfar-seeing egoism. But the faith to which the Christian Church promises\nsalvation is this: that as through the fall of the first man we are all\npartakers of sin and subject to death and perdition, through the divine\nsubstitute, through grace and the taking upon himself of our fearful\nguilt, we are all saved, without any merit of our own (of the person);\nsince that which can proceed from the intentional (determined by motives)\naction of the person, works, can never justify us, from its very nature,\njust because it is _intentional_, action induced by motives, _opus\noperatum_. Thus in this faith there is implied, first of all, that our\ncondition is originally and essentially an incurable one, from which we\nneed _salvation_; then, that we ourselves essentially belong to evil, and\nare so firmly bound to it that our works according to law and precept,\n_i.e._, according to motives, can never satisfy justice nor save us; but\nsalvation is only obtained through faith, _i.e._, through a changed mode\nof knowing, and this faith can only come through grace, thus as from\nwithout. This means that the salvation is one which is quite foreign to\nour person, and points to a denial and surrender of this person necessary\nto salvation. Works, the result of the law as such, can never justify,\nbecause they are always action following upon motives. Luther demands (in\nhis book \u201c_De Libertate Christiana_\u201d) that after the entrance of faith the\ngood works shall proceed from it entirely of themselves, as symptoms, as\nfruits of it; yet by no means as constituting in themselves a claim to\nmerit, justification, or reward, but taking place quite voluntarily and\ngratuitously. So we also hold that from the ever-clearer penetration of\nthe _principium individuationis_ proceeds, first, merely free justice,\nthen love, extending to the complete abolition of egoism, and finally\nresignation or denial of the will.\nI have here introduced these dogmas of Christian theology, which in\nthemselves are foreign to philosophy, merely for the purpose of showing\nthat the ethical doctrine which proceeds from our whole investigation, and\nis in complete agreement and connection with all its parts, although new\nand unprecedented in its expression, is by no means so in its real nature,\nbut fully agrees with the Christian dogmas properly so called, and indeed,\nas regards its essence, was contained and present in them. It also agrees\nquite as accurately with the doctrines and ethical teachings of the sacred\nbooks of India, which in their turn are presented in quite different\nforms. At the same time the calling to mind of the dogmas of the Christian\nChurch serves to explain and illustrate the apparent contradiction between\nthe necessity of all expressions of character when motives are presented\n(the kingdom of Nature) on the one hand, and the freedom of the will in\nitself, to deny itself, and abolish the character with all the necessity\nof the motives based upon it (the kingdom of grace) on the other hand.\n\u00a7 71. I now end the general account of ethics, and with it the whole\ndevelopment of that one thought which it has been my object to impart; and\nI by no means desire to conceal here an objection which concerns this last\npart of my exposition, but rather to point out that it lies in the nature\nof the question, and that it is quite impossible to remove it. It is this,\nthat after our investigation has brought us to the point at which we have\nbefore our eyes perfect holiness, the denial and surrender of all\nvolition, and thus the deliverance from a world whose whole existence we\nhave found to be suffering, this appears to us as a passing away into\nempty nothingness.\nOn this I must first remark, that the conception of nothing is essentially\nrelative, and always refers to a definite something which it negatives.\nThis quality has been attributed (by Kant) merely to the _nihil\nprivativum_, which is indicated by - as opposed to +, which -, from an\nopposite point of view, might become +, and in opposition to this _nihil\nprivativum_ the _nihil negativum_ has been set up, which would in every\nreference be nothing, and as an example of this the logical contradiction\nwhich does away with itself has been given. But more closely considered,\nno absolute nothing, no proper _nihil negativum_ is even thinkable; but\neverything of this kind, when considered from a higher standpoint or\nsubsumed under a wider concept, is always merely a _nihil privativum_.\nEvery nothing is thought as such only in relation to something, and\npresupposes this relation, and thus also this something. Even a logical\ncontradiction is only a relative nothing. It is no thought of the reason,\nbut it is not on that account an absolute nothing; for it is a combination\nof words; it is an example of the unthinkable, which is necessary in logic\nin order to prove the laws of thought. Therefore if for this end such an\nexample is sought, we will stick to the nonsense as the positive which we\nare in search of, and pass over the sense as the negative. Thus every\n_nihil negativum_, if subordinated to a higher concept, will appear as a\nmere _nihil privativum_ or relative nothing, which can, moreover, always\nexchange signs with what it negatives, so that that would then be thought\nas negation, and it itself as assertion. This also agrees with the result\nof the difficult dialectical investigation of the meaning of nothing which\nPlato gives in the \u201cSophist\u201d (pp. 277-287): \u03a4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f11\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\n\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1, \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03bd \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\n\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f61\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03b7 \u03bf\u03bd (_Cum enim ostenderemus,\nalterius ipsius naturam esse perque omnia entia divisam atque dispersam in\nvicem; tunc partem ejus oppositam ei, quod cujusque ens est, esse ipsum\nrevera non ens asseruimus_).\nThat which is generally received as positive, which we call the real, and\nthe negation of which the concept nothing in its most general significance\nexpresses, is just the world as idea, which I have shown to be the\nobjectivity and mirror of the will. Moreover, we ourselves are just this\nwill and this world, and to them belongs the idea in general, as one\naspect of them. The form of the idea is space and time, therefore for this\npoint of view all that is real must be in some place and at some time.\nDenial, abolition, conversion of the will, is also the abolition and the\nvanishing of the world, its mirror. If we no longer perceive it in this\nmirror, we ask in vain where it has gone, and then, because it has no\nlonger any where and when, complain that it has vanished into nothing.\nA reversed point of view, if it were possible for us, would reverse the\nsigns and show the real for us as nothing, and that nothing as the real.\nBut as long as we ourselves are the will to live, this last\u2014nothing as the\nreal\u2014can only be known and signified by us negatively, because the old\nsaying of Empedocles, that like can only be known by like, deprives us\nhere of all knowledge, as, conversely, upon it finally rests the\npossibility of all our actual knowledge, _i.e._, the world as idea; for\nthe world is the self-knowledge of the will.\nIf, however, it should be absolutely insisted upon that in some way or\nother a positive knowledge should be attained of that which philosophy can\nonly express negatively as the denial of the will, there would be nothing\nfor it but to refer to that state which all those who have attained to\ncomplete denial of the will have experienced, and which has been variously\ndenoted by the names ecstasy, rapture, illumination, union with God, and\nso forth; a state, however, which cannot properly be called knowledge,\nbecause it has not the form of subject and object, and is, moreover, only\nattainable in one\u2019s own experience and cannot be further communicated.\nWe, however, who consistently occupy the standpoint of philosophy, must be\nsatisfied here with negative knowledge, content to have reached the utmost\nlimit of the positive. We have recognised the inmost nature of the world\nas will, and all its phenomena as only the objectivity of will; and we\nhave followed this objectivity from the unconscious working of obscure\nforces of Nature up to the completely conscious action of man. Therefore\nwe shall by no means evade the consequence, that with the free denial, the\nsurrender of the will, all those phenomena are also abolished; that\nconstant strain and effort without end and without rest at all the grades\nof objectivity, in which and through which the world consists; the\nmultifarious forms succeeding each other in gradation; the whole\nmanifestation of the will; and, finally, also the universal forms of this\nmanifestation, time and space, and also its last fundamental form, subject\nand object; all are abolished. No will: no idea, no world.\nBefore us there is certainly only nothingness. But that which resists this\npassing into nothing, our nature, is indeed just the will to live, which\nwe ourselves are as it is our world. That we abhor annihilation so\ngreatly, is simply another expression of the fact that we so strenuously\nwill life, and are nothing but this will, and know nothing besides it. But\nif we turn our glance from our own needy and embarrassed condition to\nthose who have overcome the world, in whom the will, having attained to\nperfect self-knowledge, found itself again in all, and then freely denied\nitself, and who then merely wait to see the last trace of it vanish with\nthe body which it animates; then, instead of the restless striving and\neffort, instead of the constant transition from wish to fruition, and from\njoy to sorrow, instead of the never-satisfied and never-dying hope which\nconstitutes the life of the man who wills, we shall see that peace which\nis above all reason, that perfect calm of the spirit, that deep rest, that\ninviolable confidence and serenity, the mere reflection of which in the\ncountenance, as Raphael and Correggio have represented it, is an entire\nand certain gospel; only knowledge remains, the will has vanished. We look\nwith deep and painful longing upon this state, beside which the misery and\nwretchedness of our own is brought out clearly by the contrast. Yet this\nis the only consideration which can afford us lasting consolation, when,\non the one hand, we have recognised incurable suffering and endless misery\nas essential to the manifestation of will, the world; and, on the other\nhand, see the world pass away with the abolition of will, and retain\nbefore us only empty nothingness. Thus, in this way, by contemplation of\nthe life and conduct of saints, whom it is certainly rarely granted us to\nmeet with in our own experience, but who are brought before our eyes by\ntheir written history, and, with the stamp of inner truth, by art, we must\nbanish the dark impression of that nothingness which we discern behind all\nvirtue and holiness as their final goal, and which we fear as children\nfear the dark; we must not even evade it like the Indians, through myths\nand meaningless words, such as reabsorption in Brahma or the Nirvana of\nthe Buddhists. Rather do we freely acknowledge that what remains after the\nentire abolition of will is for all those who are still full of will\ncertainly nothing; but, conversely, to those in whom the will has turned\nand has denied itself, this our world, which is so real, with all its suns\nand milky-ways\u2014is nothing.(92)\nFOOTNOTES\n1 F.

The forehead and the eyes\ninterpret each other; either of them seen alone can only be half\nunderstood. Genius is never without a high, broad, finely-arched\nbrow; but such a brow often occurs where there is no genius. A\nclever-looking person may the more certainly be judged to be so the\nuglier the face is; and a stupid-looking person may the more\ncertainly be judged to be stupid the more beautiful the face is; for\nbeauty, as the approximation to the type of humanity, carries in and\nfor itself the expression of mental clearness; the opposite is the\ncase with ugliness, and so forth.\n17 Cf.

For what he knew\nwith certainty and decision from the immediate, perceptive\napprehension of the nature of the world, he seeks to demonstrate\nlogically without reference to this knowledge. He only arrives at\nthe intended and predetermined result by starting from arbitrary\nconcepts framed by himself (_substantia causa sui_, &c.), and in the\ndemonstrations he allows himself all the freedom of choice for which\nthe nature of the wide concept-spheres afford such convenient\nopportunity.

Everything has its language by which to reveal itself....\nAnd this is the language of nature when everything speaks out of its\nown property, and continually manifests and declares itself, ... for\neach thing reveals its mother, which thus gives _the essence and the\nwill_ to the form.\u201d\n54 The last sentence is the German of the _il n\u2019y a que l\u2019esprit qui\nsente l\u2019esprit_, of Helvetius. In the first edition there was no\noccasion to point this out, but since then the age has become so\ndegraded and ignorant through the stupefying influence of the\nHegelian sophistry, that some might quite likely say that an\nantithesis was intended here between \u201cspirit and nature.\u201d I am\ntherefore obliged to guard myself in express terms against the\nsuspicion of such vulgar sophisms.\n55 This digression is worked out more fully in the 36th Chapter of the\nSupplement.\n56 In order to understand this passage it is necessary to have read the\nwhole of the next book.\n_   57 Apparent rari, nantes in gurgite vasto._\n58 Cf. Ch. xxxiv. of Supplement.\n59 It is scarcely necessary to say that wherever I speak of poets I\nrefer exclusively to that rare phenomenon the great true poet. I\nmean no one else; least of all that dull insipid tribe, the mediocre\npoets, rhymsters, and inventors of fables, that flourishes so\nluxuriantly at the present day in Germany.

For the public\nalways seizes on what is new, and has naturally a greater proneness\nto what is perverse and dull as akin to itself. Therefore these\nworks of the mediocre poets draw it away and hold it back from the\ntrue masterpieces and the education they afford, and thus working in\ndirect antagonism to the benign influence of genius, they ruin taste\nmore and more, and retard the progress of the age. Such poets should\ntherefore be scourged with criticism and satire without indulgence\nor sympathy till they are induced, for their own good, to apply\ntheir muse rather to reading what is good than to writing what is\nbad. For if the bungling of the incompetent so raised the wrath of\nthe gentle Apollo that he could flay Marsyas, I do not see on what\nthe mediocre poets will base their claim to tolerance.\n60 Cf.

Every individual is, on the one hand, the\nsubject of knowing, _i.e._, the complemental condition of the\npossibility of the whole objective world, and, on the other hand, a\nparticular phenomenon of will, the same will which objectifies\nitself in everything. But this double nature of our being does not\nrest upon a self-existing unity, otherwise it would be possible for\nus to be conscious of ourselves _in ourselves, and independent of\nthe objects of knowledge and will_. Now this is by no means\npossible, for as soon as we turn into ourselves to make the attempt,\nand seek for once to know ourselves fully by means of introspective\nreflection, we are lost in a bottomless void; we find ourselves like\nthe hollow glass globe, from out of which a voice speaks whose cause\nis not to be found in it, and whereas we desired to comprehend\nourselves, we find, with a shudder, nothing but a vanishing spectre.\n65 \u201cScholastici docuerunt, quod \u00e6ternitas non sit temporis sine fine\naut principio successio; sed _Nunc stans_, _i.e._, idem nobis _Nunc\nesse_, quod erat _Nunc Adamo_, _i.e._, inter _nunc_ et _tunc_ nullam\nesse differentiam.\u201d\u2014Hobbes, Leviathan, c. 46.\n66 In Eckermann\u2019s \u201cConversations of Goethe\u201d (vol. i. p. 161), Goethe\nsays: \u201cOur spirit is a being of a nature quite indestructible, and\nits activity continues from eternity to eternity. It is like the\nsun, which seems to set only to our earthly eyes, but which, in\nreality, never sets, but shines on unceasingly.\u201d Goethe has taken\nthe simile from me; not I from him. Without doubt he used it in this\nconversation, which was held in 1824, in consequence of a (possibly\nunconscious) reminiscence of the above passage, for it occurs in the\nfirst edition, p. 401, in exactly the same words, and it is also\nrepeated at p. 528 of that edition, as at the close of \u00a7 65 of the\npresent work. The first edition was sent to him in December 1818,\nand in March 1819, when I was at Naples, he sent me his\ncongratulations by letter, through my sister, and enclosed a piece\nof paper upon which he had noted the places of certain passages\nwhich had specially pleased him. Thus he had read my book.\n67 This is expressed in the Veda by saying, that when a man dies his\nsight becomes one with the sun, his smell with the earth, his taste\nwith water, his hearing with the air, his speech with fire, &c., &c.\n(Oupnek\u2019hat, vol. i. p. 249 _et seq._) And also by the fact that, in\na special ceremony, the dying man gives over his senses and all his\nfaculties singly to his son, in whom they are now supposed to live\non (Oupnek\u2019hat, vol. ii. p. 82 _et seq._)\n68 Cf.

Examples are also to be found in\nMontaigne, Bk. ii. ch. 12.\n79 Observe, in passing, that what gives every positive system of\nreligion its great strength, the point of contact through which it\ntakes possession of the soul, is entirely its ethical side. Not,\nhowever, the ethical side directly as such, but as it appears firmly\nunited and interwoven with the element of mythical dogma which is\npresent in every system of religion, and as intelligible only by\nmeans of this. So much is this the case, that although the ethical\nsignificance of action cannot be explained in accordance with the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, yet since every mythus follows this\nprinciple, believers regard the ethical significance of action as\nquite inseparable, and indeed as absolutely identical, and regard\nevery attack upon the mythus as an attack upon right and virtue.\nThis goes so far that among monotheistic nations atheism or\ngodlessness has become synonymous with the absence of all morality.\nTo the priests such confusions of conceptions are welcome, and only\nin consequence of them could that horrible monstrosity fanaticism\narise and govern, not merely single individuals who happen to be\nspecially perverse and bad, but whole nations, and finally embody\nitself in the Western world as the Inquisition (to the honour of\nmankind be it said that this only happened once in their history),\nwhich, according to the latest and most authentic accounts, in\nMadrid alone (in the rest of Spain there were many more such\necclesiastical dens of murderers) in 300 years put 300,000 human\nbeings to a painful death at the stake on theological grounds\u2014a fact\nof which every zealot ought to be reminded whenever he begins to\nmake himself heard.\n80 The Church would say that these are merely _opera operata_, which do\nnot avail unless grace gives the faith which leads to the new birth.\nBut of this farther on.\n81 The right of man over the life and powers of the brutes rests on the\nfact that, because with the growing clearness of consciousness\nsuffering increases in like measure; the pain which the brute\nsuffers through death or work is not so great as man would suffer by\nmerely denying himself the flesh, or the powers of the brutes.\nTherefore man may carry the assertion of his existence to the extent\nof denying the existence of the brute, and the will to live as a\nwhole endures less suffering in this way than if the opposite course\nwere adopted. This at once determines the extent of the use man may\nmake of the powers of the brutes without wrong; a limit, however,\nwhich is often transgressed, especially in the case of beasts of\nburden and dogs used in the chase; to which the activity of\nsocieties for the prevention of cruelty to animals is principally\ndevoted. In my opinion, that right does not extend to vivisection,\nparticularly of the higher animals. On the other hand, the insect\ndoes not suffer so much through its death as a man suffers from its\nsting. The Hindus do not understand this.\n82 As I wander sunk in thought, so strong a sympathy with myself comes\nover me that I must often weep aloud, which otherwise I am not wont\nto do.\n83 Cf.

It is scarcely necessary to remind the\nreader that the whole ethical doctrine given in outline in \u00a7\u00a7 61-67\nhas been explained fully and in detail in my prize-essay on the\nfoundation of morals.\n84 This thought is expressed by a beautiful simile in the ancient\nphilosophical Sanscrit writing, \u201cSankhya Karica:\u201d \u201cYet the soul\nremains a while invested with body; as the potter\u2019s wheel continues\nwhirling after the pot has been fashioned, by force of the impulse\npreviously given to it.

Then all is at\nonce clear and correct: then there is no need of freedom in the\n_operari_, for it lies in the _esse_; and there also lies the sin as\noriginal sin. The work of grace is, however, our own. To the\nrationalistic point of view of the day, on the contrary, many\ndoctrines of the Augustinian dogmatics, founded on the New\nTestament, appear quite untenable, and indeed revolting; for\nexample, predestination. Accordingly Christianity proper is\nrejected, and a return is made to crude Judaism. But the\nmiscalculation or the original weakness of Christian dogmatics\nlies\u2014where it is never sought\u2014precisely in that which is withdrawn\nfrom all investigation as established and certain. Take this away\nand the whole of dogmatics is rational; for this dogma destroys\ntheology as it does all other sciences. If any one studies the\nAugustinian theology in the books \u201c_De Civitate Dei_\u201d (especially in\nthe Fourteenth Book), he experiences something analogous to the\nfeeling of one who tries to make a body stand whose centre of\ngravity falls outside it; however he may turn it and place it, it\nalways tumbles over again. So here, in spite of all the efforts and\nsophisms of Augustine, the guilt and misery of the world always\nfalls back on God, who made everything and everything that is in\neverything, and also knew how all things would go. That Augustine\nhimself was conscious of the difficulty, and puzzled by it, I have\nalready shown in my prize-essay on the Freedom of the Will (ch. iv.\npp. 66-68 of the first and second editions). In the same way, the\ncontradiction between the goodness of God and the misery of the\nworld, and also between the freedom of the will and the\nforeknowledge of God, is the inexhaustible theme of a controversy\nwhich lasted nearly a hundred years between the Cartesians,\nMalebranche, Leibnitz, Bayle, Clarke, Arnauld, and many others. The\nonly dogma which was regarded as fixed by all parties was the\nexistence and attributes of God, and they all unceasingly move in a\ncircle, because they seek to bring these things into harmony,\n_i.e._, to solve a sum that will not come right, but always shows a\nremainder at some new place whenever we have concealed it elsewhere.\nBut it does not occur to any one to seek for the source of the\ndifficulty in the fundamental assumption, although it palpably\nobtrudes itself. Bayle alone shows that he saw this.\n92 This is also just the Prajna\u2014Paramita of the Buddhists, the \u201cbeyond\nall knowledge,\u201d _i.e._, the point at which subject and object are no\nmore.

GENERAL RULES\nII.  OUR RELATION TO OURSELVES\nIII. OUR RELATION TO OTHERS\nIV.  WORLDLY FORTUNE\nV.   THE AGES OF LIFE\nINTRODUCTION.\nIf my object in these pages were to present a complete scheme of\ncounsels and maxims for the guidance of life, I should have to repeat\nthe numerous rules--some of them excellent--which have been drawn\nup by thinkers of all ages, from Theognis and Solomon[1] down to La\nRochefoucauld; and, in so doing, I should inevitably entail upon the\nreader a vast amount of well-worn commonplace. But the fact is that in\nthis work I make still less claim to exhaust my subject than in any\nother of my writings.\n[Footnote 1: I refer to the proverbs and maxims ascribed, in the Old\nTestament, to the king of that name.]\nAn author who makes no claims to completeness must also, in a great\nmeasure, abandon any attempt at systematic arrangement. For his double\nloss in this respect, the reader may console himself by reflecting\nthat a complete and systematic treatment of such a subject as the\nguidance of life could hardly fail to be a very wearisome business.\nI have simply put down those of my thoughts which appear to be worth\ncommunicating--thoughts which, as far as I know, have not been\nuttered, or, at any rate, not just in the same form, by any one else;\nso that my remarks may be taken as a supplement to what has been\nalready achieved in the immense field.\nHowever, by way of introducing some sort of order into the great\nvariety of matters upon which advice will be given in the following\npages, I shall distribute what I have to say under the following\nheads: (1) general rules; (2) our relation to ourselves; (3) our\nrelation to others; and finally, (4) rules which concern our manner of\nlife and our worldly circumstances. I shall conclude with some remarks\non the changes which the various periods of life produce in us.\nCHAPTER I.\nGENERAL RULES.--SECTION 1.\nThe first and foremost rule for the wise conduct of life seems to me\nto be contained in a view to which Aristotle parenthetically refers in\nthe _Nichomachean Ethics_:[1] [Greek: o phronimoz to alupon dioke e ou\nto aedu] or, as it may be rendered, _not pleasure, but freedom from\npain, is what the wise man will aim at_.\n[Footnote 1: vii. (12) 12.]\nThe truth of this remark turns upon the negative character of\nhappiness,--the fact that pleasure is only the negation of pain, and\nthat pain is the positive element in life. Though I have given a\ndetailed proof of this proposition in my chief work,[1] I may supply\none more illustration of it here, drawn from a circumstance of daily\noccurrence. Suppose that, with the exception of some sore or painful\nspot, we are physically in a sound and healthy condition: the sore of\nthis one spot, will completely absorb our attention, causing us to\nlose the sense of general well-being, and destroying all our comfort\nin life. In the same way, when all our affairs but one turn out as\nwe wish, the single instance in which our aims are frustrated is a\nconstant trouble to us, even though it be something quite trivial. We\nthink a great deal about it, and very little about those other and\nmore important matters in which we have been successful. In both these\ncases what has met with resistance is _the will_; in the one case, as\nit is objectified in the organism, in the other, as it presents\nitself in the struggle of life; and in both, it is plain that the\nsatisfaction of the will consists in nothing else than that it meets\nwith no resistance. It is, therefore, a satisfaction which is not\ndirectly felt; at most, we can become conscious of it only when we\nreflect upon our condition. But that which checks or arrests the will\nis something positive; it proclaims its own presence. All pleasure\nconsists in merely removing this check--in other words, in freeing us\nfrom its action; and hence pleasure is a state which can never last\nvery long.\n[Footnote 1: _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_. Vol. I., p. 58.]\nThis is the true basis of the above excellent rule quoted from\nAristotle, which bids us direct our aim, not toward securing what is\npleasurable and agreeable in life, but toward avoiding, as far as\npossible, its innumerable evils. If this were not the right course to\ntake, that saying of Voltaire's, _Happiness is but a dream and sorrow\nis real_, would be as false as it is, in fact, true. A man who desires\nto make up the book of his life and determine where the balance of\nhappiness lies, must put down in his accounts, not the pleasures which\nhe has enjoyed, but the evils which he has escaped. That is the\ntrue method of eudaemonology; for all eudaemonology must begin by\nrecognizing that its very name is a euphemism, and that _to live\nhappily_ only means _to live less unhappily_--to live a tolerable\nlife. There is no doubt that life is given us, not to be enjoyed,\nbut to be overcome--to be got over. There are numerous expressions\nillustrating this--such as _degere vitam, vita defungi_; or\nin Italian, _si scampa cosi_; or in German, _man muss suchen\ndurchzukommen; er wird schon durch die Welt kommen_, and so on. In old\nage it is indeed a consolation to think that the work of life is over\nand done with. The happiest lot is not to have experienced the keenest\ndelights or the greatest pleasures, but to have brought life to a\nclose without any very great pain, bodily or mental. To measure the\nhappiness of a life by its delights or pleasures, is to apply a false\nstandard. For pleasures are and remain something negative; that\nthey produce happiness is a delusion, cherished by envy to its own\npunishment. Pain is felt to be something positive, and hence its\nabsence is the true standard of happiness. And if, over and above\nfreedom from pain, there is also an absence of boredom, the essential\nconditions of earthly happiness are attained; for all else is\nchimerical.\nIt follows from this that a man should never try to purchase pleasure\nat the cost of pain, or even at the risk of incurring it; to do so is\nto pay what is positive and real, for what is negative and illusory;\nwhile there is a net profit in sacrificing pleasure for the sake of\navoiding pain. In either case it is a matter of indifference whether\nthe pain follows the pleasure or precedes it. While it is a complete\ninversion of the natural order to try and turn this scene of misery\ninto a garden of pleasure, to aim at joy and pleasure rather than\nat the greatest possible freedom from pain--and yet how many do\nit!--there is some wisdom in taking a gloomy view, in looking upon the\nworld as a kind of Hell, and in confining one's efforts to securing\na little room that shall not be exposed to the fire. The fool rushes\nafter the pleasures of life and finds himself their dupe; the wise man\navoids its evils; and even if, notwithstanding his precautions, he\nfalls into misfortunes, that is the fault of fate, not of his own\nfolly. As far as he is successful in his endeavors, he cannot be said\nto have lived a life of illusion; for the evils which he shuns are\nvery real. Even if he goes too far out of his way to avoid evils, and\nmakes an unnecessary sacrifice of pleasure, he is, in reality, not the\nworse off for that; for all pleasures are chimerical, and to mourn\nfor having lost any of them is a frivolous, and even ridiculous\nproceeding.\nThe failure to recognize this truth--a failure promoted by optimistic\nideas--is the source of much unhappiness. In moments free from pain,\nour restless wishes present, as it were in a mirror, the image of a\nhappiness that has no counterpart in reality, seducing us to follow\nit; in doing so we bring pain upon ourselves, and that is something\nundeniably real. Afterwards, we come to look with regret upon that\nlost state of painlessness; it is a paradise which we have gambled\naway; it is no longer with us, and we long in vain to undo what has\nbeen done.\nOne might well fancy that these visions of wishes fulfilled were the\nwork of some evil spirit, conjured up in order to entice us away from\nthat painless state which forms our highest happiness.\nA careless youth may think that the world is meant to be enjoyed, as\nthough it were the abode of some real or positive happiness, which\nonly those fail to attain who are not clever enough to overcome the\ndifficulties that lie in the way. This false notion takes a stronger\nhold on him when he comes to read poetry and romance, and to be\ndeceived by outward show--the hypocrisy that characterizes the\nworld from beginning to end; on which I shall have something to say\npresently. The result is that his life is the more or less deliberate\npursuit of positive happiness; and happiness he takes to be equivalent\nto a series of definite pleasures. In seeking for these pleasures he\nencounters danger--a fact which should not be forgotten. He hunts for\ngame that does not exist; and so he ends by suffering some very\nreal and positive misfortune--pain, distress, sickness, loss, care,\npoverty, shame, and all the thousand ills of life. Too late he\ndiscovers the trick that has been played upon him.\nBut if the rule I have mentioned is observed, and a plan of life is\nadopted which proceeds by avoiding pain--in other words, by taking\nmeasures of precaution against want, sickness, and distress in all its\nforms, the aim is a real one, and something may be achieved which will\nbe great in proportion as the plan is not disturbed by striving after\nthe chimera of positive happiness. This agrees with the opinion\nexpressed by Goethe in the _Elective Affinities_, and there put into\nthe mouth of Mittler--the man who is always trying to make other\npeople happy: _To desire to get rid of an evil is a definite object,\nbut to desire a better fortune than one has is blind folly_. The same\ntruth is contained in that fine French proverb: _le mieux est l'ennemi\ndu bien_--leave well alone. And, as I have remarked in my chief\nwork,[1] this is the leading thought underlying the philosophical\nsystem of the Cynics. For what was it led the Cynics to repudiate\npleasure in every form, if it was not the fact that pain is, in a\ngreater or less degree, always bound up with pleasure? To go out of\nthe way of pain seemed to them so much easier than to secure pleasure.\nDeeply impressed as they were by the negative nature of pleasure and\nthe positive nature of pain, they consistently devoted all their\nefforts to the avoidance of pain. The first step to that end was, in\ntheir opinion, a complete and deliberate repudiation of pleasure, as\nsomething which served only to entrap the victim in order that he\nmight be delivered over to pain.\n[Footnote 1: _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_, vol. ii., ch. 16.]\nWe are all born, as Schiller says, in Arcadia. In other words, we\ncome into the world full of claims to happiness and pleasure, and we\ncherish the fond hope of making them good. But, as a rule, Fate soon\nteaches us, in a rough and ready way that we really possess nothing at\nall, but that everything in the world is at its command, in virtue of\nan unassailable right, not only to all we have or acquire, to wife or\nchild, but even to our very limbs, our arms, legs, _eyes_ and ears,\nnay, even to the nose in the middle of our face. And in any case,\nafter some little time, we learn by experience that happiness and\npleasure are a _fata morgana_, which, visible from afar, vanish as we\napproach; that, on the other hand, suffering and pain are a reality,\nwhich makes its presence felt without any intermediary, and for its\neffect, stands in no need of illusion or the play of false hope.\nIf the teaching of experience bears fruit in us, we soon give up the\npursuit of pleasure and happiness, and think much more about making\nourselves secure against the attacks of pain and suffering. We see\nthat the best the world has to offer is an existence free from pain--a\nquiet, tolerable life; and we confine our claims to this, as to\nsomething we can more surely hope to achieve. For the safest way of\nnot being very miserable is not to expect to be very happy. Merck, the\nfriend of Goethe's youth, was conscious of this truth when he\nwrote: _It is the wretched way people have of setting up a claim to\nhappiness_--_and, that to, in a measure corresponding with their\ndesires_--_that ruins everything in this world. A man will make\nprogress if he can get rid of this claim,[1] and desire nothing but\nwhat he sees before him_. Accordingly it is advisable to put very\nmoderate limits upon our expectations of pleasure, possessions, rank,\nhonor and so on; because it is just this striving and struggling to\nbe happy, to dazzle the world, to lead a life full of pleasure, which\nentail great misfortune. It is prudent and wise, I say, to reduce\none's claims, if only for the reason that it is extremely easy to be\nvery unhappy; while to be very happy is not indeed difficult, but\nquite impossible. With justice sings the poet of life's wisdom:\n_Auream quisquis mediocritatem\nDiligit, tutus caret obsoleti\nSordibus tecti, caret invidenda\nSobrius aula.\nSavius ventis agitatur ingens\nPinus: et celsae graviori casu\nDecidunt turres; feriuntque summos\nFulgura monies.[2]_\n--the golden mean is best--to live free from the squalor of a mean\nabode, and yet not be a mark for envy. It is the tall pine which is\ncruelly shaken by the wind, the highest summits that are struck in the\nstorm, and the lofty towers that fall so heavily.\n[Footnote 1: Letters to and from Merck.]\n[Footnote 2: Horace. Odes II. x.]\nHe who has taken to heart the teaching of my philosophy--who knows,\ntherefore, that our whole existence is something which had better\nnot have been, and that to disown and disclaim it is the highest\nwisdom--he will have no great expectations from anything or any\ncondition in life: he will spend passion upon nothing in the world,\nnor lament over-much if he fails in any of his undertakings. He\nwill feel the deep truth of what Plato[1] says: [Greek: oute ti ton\nanthropinon haxion on megalaes spondaes]--nothing in human affairs is\nworth any great anxiety; or, as the Persian poet has it,\n_Though from thy grasp all worldly things should flee,\nGrieve not for them, for they are nothing worth:\nAnd though a world in thy possession be,\nJoy not, for worthless are the things of earth.\nSince to that better world 'tis given to thee\nTo pass, speed on, for this is nothing worth._[2]\n[Footnote 1: _Republic_, x. 604.]\n[Footnote 2: _Translator's Note_. From the Anv\u00e1r-i Suhail\u00ed--_The\nLights of Canopus_--being the Persian version of the _Table of\nBidpai_. Translated by E.B. Eastwick, ch. iii. Story vi., p. 289.]\nThe chief obstacle to our arriving at these salutary views is that\nhypocrisy of the world to which I have already alluded--an hypocrisy\nwhich should be early revealed to the young. Most of the glories of\nthe world are mere outward show, like the scenes on a stage: there\nis nothing real about them. Ships festooned and hung with pennants,\nfiring of cannon, illuminations, beating of drums and blowing of\ntrumpets, shouting and applauding--these are all the outward sign, the\npretence and suggestion,--as it were the hieroglyphic,--of _joy_: but\njust there, joy is, as a rule, not to be found; it is the only guest\nwho has declined to be present at the festival. Where this guest may\nreally be found, he comes generally without invitation; he is not\nformerly announced, but slips in quietly by himself _sans facon_;\noften making his appearance under the most unimportant and trivial\ncircumstances, and in the commonest company--anywhere, in short, but\nwhere the society is brilliant and distinguished. Joy is like the gold\nin the Australian mines--found only now and then, as it were, by the\ncaprice of chance, and according to no rule or law; oftenest in very\nlittle grains, and very seldom in heaps. All that outward show which I\nhave described, is only an attempt to make people believe that it\nis really joy which has come to the festival; and to produce this\nimpression upon the spectators is, in fact, the whole object of it.\nWith _mourning_ it is just the same. That long funeral procession,\nmoving up so slowly; how melancholy it looks! what an endless row of\ncarriages! But look into them--they are all empty; the coachmen of the\nwhole town are the sole escort the dead man has to his grave. Eloquent\npicture of the friendship and esteem of the world! This is the\nfalsehood, the hollowness, the hypocrisy of human affairs!\nTake another example--a roomful of guests in full dress, being\nreceived with great ceremony. You could almost believe that this is\na noble and distinguished company; but, as a matter of fact, it is\ncompulsion, pain and boredom who are the real guests. For where many\nare invited, it is a rabble--even if they all wear stars. Really good\nsociety is everywhere of necessity very small. In brilliant festivals\nand noisy entertainments, there is always, at bottom, a sense of\nemptiness prevalent. A false tone is there: such gatherings are in\nstrange contrast with the misery and barrenness of our existence. The\ncontrast brings the true condition into greater relief. Still, these\ngatherings are effective from the outside; and that is just their\npurpose. Chamfort[1] makes the excellent remark that _society_--_les\ncercles, les salons, ce qu'on appelle le monde_--is like a miserable\nplay, or a bad opera, without any interest in itself, but supported\nfor a time by mechanical aid, costumes and scenery.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. Nicholas \"Chamfort\" (1741-94), a\nFrench miscellaneous writer, whose brilliant conversation, power of\nsarcasm, and epigrammic force, coupled with an extraordinary career,\nrender him one of the most interesting and remarkable men of his\ntime. Schopenhauer undoubtedly owed much to this writer, to whom he\nconstantly refers.]\nAnd so, too, with academies and chairs of philosophy. You have a kind\nof sign-board hung out to show the apparent abode of _wisdom_: but\nwisdom is another guest who declines the invitation; she is to be\nfound elsewhere. The chiming of bells, ecclesiastical millinery,\nattitudes of devotion, insane antics--these are the pretence, the\nfalse show of _piety_. And so on. Everything in the world is like a\nhollow nut; there is little kernel anywhere, and when it does exist,\nit is still more rare to find it in the shell. You may look for it\nelsewhere, and find it, as a rule, only by chance.\nSECTION 2. To estimate a man's condition in regard to happiness, it is\nnecessary to ask, not what things please him, but what things trouble\nhim; and the more trivial these things are in themselves, the happier\nthe man will be. To be irritated by trifles, a man must be well off;\nfor in misfortunes trifles are unfelt.\nSECTION 3. Care should be taken not to build the happiness of life\nupon a _broad foundation_--not to require a great many things in order\nto be happy. For happiness on such a foundation is the most easily\nundermined; it offers many more opportunities for accidents; and\naccidents are always happening. The architecture of happiness follows\na plan in this respect just the opposite of that adopted in every\nother case, where the broadest foundation offers the greatest\nsecurity. Accordingly, to reduce your claims to the lowest possible\ndegree, in comparison with your means,--of whatever kind these may\nbe--is the surest way of avoiding extreme misfortune.\nTo make extensive preparations for life--no matter what form they\nmay take--is one of the greatest and commonest of follies. Such\npreparations presuppose, in the first place, a long life, the full and\ncomplete term of years appointed to man--and how few reach it! and\neven if it be reached, it is still too short for all the plans that\nhave been made; for to carry them out requites more time than was\nthought necessary at the beginning. And then how many mischances and\nobstacles stand in the way! how seldom the goal is ever reached in\nhuman affairs!\nAnd lastly, even though the goal should be reached, the changes which\nTime works in us have been left out of the reckoning: we forget that\nthe capacity whether for achievement or for enjoyment does not last a\nwhole lifetime. So we often toil for things which are no longer suited\nto us when we attain them; and again, the years we spend in preparing\nfor some work, unconsciously rob us of the power for carrying it out.\nHow often it happens that a man is unable to enjoy the wealth which he\nacquired at so much trouble and risk, and that the fruits of his\nlabor are reserved for others; or that he is incapable of filling the\nposition which he has won after so many years of toil and struggle.\nFortune has come too late for him; or, contrarily, he has come too\nlate for fortune,--when, for instance, he wants to achieve great\nthings, say, in art or literature: the popular taste has changed, it\nmay be; a new generation has grown up, which takes no interest in his\nwork; others have gone a shorter way and got the start of him. These\nare the facts of life which Horace must have had in view, when he\nlamented the uselessness of all advice:--\n_quid eternis minorem\nConsiliis animum fatigas?_[1]\n[Footnote 1: Odes II. xi.]\nThe cause of this commonest of all follies is that optical illusion of\nthe mind from which everyone suffers, making life, at its beginning,\nseem of long duration; and at its end, when one looks back over the\ncourse of it, how short a time it seems! There is some advantage in\nthe illusion; but for it, no great work would ever be done.\nOur life is like a journey on which, as we advance, the landscape\ntakes a different view from that which it presented at first,\nand changes again, as we come nearer. This is just what\nhappens--especially with our wishes. We often find something else,\nnay, something better than what we are looking for; and what we look\nfor, we often find on a very different path from that on which we\nbegan a vain search. Instead of finding, as we expected, pleasure,\nhappiness, joy, we get experience, insight, knowledge--a real and\npermanent blessing, instead of a fleeting and illusory one.\nThis is the thought that runs through _Wilkelm Meister_, like the bass\nin a piece of music. In this work of Goethe's, we have a novel of the\n_intellectual_ kind, and, therefore, superior to all others, even to\nSir Walter Scott's, which are, one and all, _ethical_; in other words,\nthey treat of human nature only from the side of the will. So, too,\nin the _Zauberfl\u00f6te_--that grotesque, but still significant, and even\nhieroglyphic--the same thought is symbolized, but in great, coarse\nlines, much in the way in which scenery is painted. Here the symbol\nwould be complete if Tamino were in the end to be cured of his desire\nto possess Tainina, and received, in her stead, initiation into the\nmysteries of the Temple of Wisdom. It is quite right for Papageno, his\nnecessary contrast, to succeed in getting his Papagena.\nMen of any worth or value soon come to see that they are in the hands\nof Fate, and gratefully submit to be moulded by its teachings. They\nrecognize that the fruit of life is experience, and not happiness;\nthey become accustomed and content to exchange hope for insight; and,\nin the end, they can say, with Petrarch, that all they care for is to\nlearn:--\n_Altro diletto che 'mparar, non provo_.\nIt may even be that they to some extent still follow their old wishes\nand aims, trifling with them, as it were, for the sake of appearances;\nall the while really and seriously looking for nothing but\ninstruction; a process which lends them an air of genius, a trait of\nsomething contemplative and sublime.\nIn their search for gold, the alchemists discovered other\nthings--gunpowder, china, medicines, the laws of nature. There is a\nsense in which we are all alchemists.\nCHAPTER II.\nOUR RELATION TO OURSELVES.--SECTION 4.\nThe mason employed on the building of a house may be quite ignorant of\nits general design; or at any rate, he may not keep it constantly in\nmind. So it is with man: in working through the days and hours of his\nlife, he takes little thought of its character as a whole.\nIf there is any merit or importance attaching to a man's career, if he\nlays himself out carefully for some special work, it is all the more\nnecessary and advisable for him to turn his attention now and then\nto its _plan_, that is to say, the miniature sketch of its general\noutlines. Of course, to do that, he must have applied the maxim\n[Greek: Gnothi seauton]; he must have made some little progress in the\nart of understanding himself. He must know what is his real, chief,\nand foremost object in life,--what it is that he most wants in order\nto be happy; and then, after that, what occupies the second and third\nplace in his thoughts; he must find out what, on the whole, his\nvocation really is--the part he has to play, his general relation to\nthe world. If he maps out important work for himself on great lines,\na glance at this miniature plan of his life will, more than anything\nelse stimulate, rouse and ennoble him, urge him on to action and keep\nhim from false paths.\nAgain, just as the traveler, on reaching a height, gets a connected\nview over the road he has taken, with its many turns and windings; so\nit is only when we have completed a period in our life, or approach\nthe end of it altogether, that we recognize the true connection\nbetween all our actions,--what it is we have achieved, what work we\nhave done. It is only then that we see the precise chain of cause and\neffect, and the exact value of all our efforts. For as long as we are\nactually engaged in the work of life, we always act in accordance with\nthe nature of our character, under the influence of motive, and within\nthe limits of our capacity,--in a word, from beginning to end, under\na law of _necessity_; at every moment we do just what appears to us\nright and proper. It is only afterwards, when we come to look back at\nthe whole course of our life and its general result, that we see the\nwhy and wherefore of it all.\nWhen we are actually doing some great deed, or creating some immortal\nwork, we are not conscious of it as such; we think only of satisfying\npresent aims, of fulfilling the intentions we happen to have at the\ntime, of doing the right thing at the moment. It is only when we\ncome to view our life as a connected whole that our character and\ncapacities show themselves in their true light; that we see how, in\nparticular instances, some happy inspiration, as it were, led us to\nchoose the only true path out of a thousand which might have brought\nus to ruin. It was our genius that guided us, a force felt in the\naffairs of the intellectual as in those of the world; and working by\nits defect just in the same way in regard to evil and disaster.\nSECTION 5. Another important element in the wise conduct of life is to\npreserve a proper proportion between our thought for the present and\nour thought for the future; in order not to spoil the one by paying\nover-great attention to the other. Many live too long in the\npresent--frivolous people, I mean; others, too much in the future,\never anxious and full of care. It is seldom that a man holds the right\nbalance between the two extremes. Those who strive and hope and live\nonly in the future, always looking ahead and impatiently anticipating\nwhat is coming, as something which will make them happy when they\nget it, are, in spite of their very clever airs, exactly like those\ndonkeys one sees in Italy, whose pace may be hurried by fixing a stick\non their heads with a wisp of hay at the end of it; this is always\njust in front of them, and they keep on trying to get it. Such people\nare in a constant state of illusion as to their whole existence; they\ngo on living _ad interim_, until at last they die.\nInstead, therefore, of always thinking about our plans and anxiously\nlooking to the future, or of giving ourselves up to regret for the\npast, we should never forget that the present is the only reality, the\nonly certainty; that the future almost always turns out contrary to\nour expectations; that the past, too, was very different from what\nwe suppose it to have been. But the past and the future are, on the\nwhole, of less consequence than we think. Distance, which makes\nobjects look small to the outward eye, makes them look big to the eye\nof thought. The present alone is true and actual; it is the only\ntime which possesses full reality, and our existence lies in it\nexclusively. Therefore we should always be glad of it, and give it\nthe welcome it deserves, and enjoy every hour that is bearable by\nits freedom from pain and annoyance with a full consciousness of its\nvalue. We shall hardly be able to do this if we make a wry face over\nthe failure of our hopes in the past or over our anxiety for the\nfuture. It is the height of folly to refuse the present hour of\nhappiness, or wantonly to spoil it by vexation at by-gones or\nuneasiness about what is to come. There is a time, of course, for\nforethought, nay, even for repentance; but when it is over let us\nthink of what is past as of something to which we have said farewell,\nof necessity subduing our hearts--\n[Greek: alla ta men protuchthai easomen achnumenoi per\ntumhon eni staethessi philon damasntes hanankae],[1]\nand of the future as of that which lies beyond our power, in the lap\nof the gods--\n[Greek: all aetoi men tauta theon en gounasi keitai.][2]\n[Footnote 1: _Iliad_, xix, 65.]\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_, xvii, 514]\nBut in regard to the present let us remember Seneca's advice, and live\neach day as if it were our whole life,--_singulas dies singulas vitas\nputa_: let us make it as agreeable as possible, it is the only real\ntime we have.\nOnly those evils which are sure to come at a definite date have\nany right to disturb us; and how few there are which fulfill this\ndescription. For evils are of two kinds; either they are possible\nonly, at most probable; or they are inevitable. Even in the case of\nevils which are sure to happen, the time at which they will happen is\nuncertain. A man who is always preparing for either class of evil will\nnot have a moment of peace left him. So, if we are not to lose all\ncomfort in life through the fear of evils, some of which are uncertain\nin themselves, and others, in the time at which they will occur, we\nshould look upon the one kind as never likely to happen, and the other\nas not likely to happen very soon.\nNow, the less our peace of mind is disturbed by fear, the more likely\nit is to be agitated by desire and expectation. This is the true\nmeaning of that song of Goethe's which is such a favorite with\neveryone: _Ich hab' mein' Sach' auf nichts gestellt_. It is only\nafter a man has got rid of all pretension, and taken refuge in mere\nunembellished existence, that he is able to attain that peace of mind\nwhich is the foundation of human happiness. Peace of mind! that is\nsomething essential to any enjoyment of the present moment; and unless\nits separate moments are enjoyed, there is an end of life's happiness\nas a whole. We should always collect that _To-day_ comes only once,\nand never returns. We fancy that it will come again to-morrow; but\n_To-morrow_ is another day, which, in its turn, comes once only.\nWe are apt to forget that every day is an integral, and therefore\nirreplaceable portion of life, and to look upon life as though it\nwere a collective idea or name which does not suffer if one of the\nindividuals it covers is destroyed.\nWe should be more likely to appreciate and enjoy the present, if,\nin those good days when we are well and strong, we did not fail to\nreflect how, in sickness and sorrow, every past hour that was free\nfrom pain and privation seemed in our memory so infinitely to be\nenvied--as it were, a lost paradise, or some one who was only then\nseen to have acted as a friend. But we live through our days of\nhappiness without noticing them; it is only when evil comes upon us\nthat we wish them back. A thousand gay and pleasant hours are wasted\nin ill-humor; we let them slip by unenjoyed, and sigh for them in vain\nwhen the sky is overcast. Those present moments that are bearable, be\nthey never so trite and common,--passed by in indifference, or, it may\nbe, impatiently pushed away,--those are the moments we should honor;\nnever failing to remember that the ebbing tide is even how hurrying\nthem into the past, where memory will store them transfigured and\nshining with an imperishable light,--in some after-time, and above\nall, when our days are evil, to raise the veil and present them as the\nobject of our fondest regret.\nSECTION 6. _Limitations always make for happiness_. We are happy in\nproportion as our range of vision, our sphere of work, our points of\ncontact with the world, are restricted and circumscribed. We are more\nlikely to feel worried and anxious if these limits are wide; for\nit means that our cares, desires and terrors are increased and\nintensified. That is why the blind are not so unhappy as we might be\ninclined to suppose; otherwise there would not be that gentle and\nalmost serene expression of peace in their faces.\nAnother reason why limitation makes for happiness is that the second\nhalf of life proves even more dreary that the first. As the years wear\non, the horizon of our aims and our points of contact with the world\nbecome more extended. In childhood our horizon is limited to\nthe narrowest sphere about us; in youth there is already a very\nconsiderable widening of our view; in manhood it comprises the whole\nrange of our activity, often stretching out over a very distant\nsphere,--the care, for instance, of a State or a nation; in old age it\nembraces posterity.\nBut even in the affairs of the intellect, limitation is necessary if\nwe are to be happy. For the less the will is excited, the less we\nsuffer. We have seen that suffering is something positive, and that\nhappiness is only a negative condition. To limit the sphere of outward\nactivity is to relieve the will of external stimulus: to limit the\nsphere of our intellectual efforts is to relieve the will of internal\nsources of excitement. This latter kind of limitation is attended by\nthe disadvantage that it opens the door to boredom, which is a direct\nsource of countless sufferings; for to banish boredom, a man will\nhave recourse to any means that may be handy--dissipation, society,\nextravagance, gaming, and drinking, and the like, which in their turn\nbring mischief, ruin and misery in their train. _Difficiles in otio\nquies_--it is difficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do. That\nlimitation in the sphere of outward activity is conducive, nay, even\nnecessary to human happiness, such as it is, may be seen in the fact\nthat the only kind of poetry which depicts men in a happy state of\nlife--Idyllic poetry, I mean,--always aims, as an intrinsic part of\nits treatment, at representing them in very simple and restricted\ncircumstances. It is this feeling, too, which is at the bottom of the\npleasure we take in what are called _genre_ pictures.\n_Simplicity_, therefore, as far as it can be attained, and even\n_monotony_, in our manner of life, if it does not mean that we\nare bored, will contribute to happiness; just because, under such\ncircumstances, life, and consequently the burden which is the\nessential concomitant of life, will be least felt. Our existence\nwill glide on peacefully like a stream which no waves or whirlpools\ndisturb.\nSECTION 7. Whether we are in a pleasant or a painful state depends,\nultimately, upon the kind of matter that pervades and engrosses our\nconsciousness. In this respect, purely intellectual occupation, for\nthe mind that is capable of it, will, as a rule, do much more in the\nway of happiness than any form of practical life, with its constant\nalternations of success and failure, and all the shocks and torments\nit produces. But it must be confessed that for such occupation a\npre-eminent amount of intellectual capacity is necessary. And in this\nconnection it may be noted that, just as a life devoted to outward\nactivity will distract and divert a man from study, and also deprive\nhim of that quiet concentration of mind which is necessary for such\nwork; so, on the other hand, a long course of thought will make\nhim more or less unfit for the noisy pursuits of real life. It\nis advisable, therefore, to suspend mental work for a while, if\ncircumstances happen which demand any degree of energy in affairs of a\npractical nature.\nSECTION 8. To live a life that shall be entirely prudent and discreet,\nand to draw from experience all the instruction it contains, it\nis requisite to be constantly thinking back,--to make a kind\nof recapitulation of what we have done, of our impressions and\nsensations, to compare our former with our present judgments--what\nwe set before us and struggle to achieve, with the actual result and\nsatisfaction we have obtained. To do this is to get a repetition of\nthe private lessons of experience,--lessons which are given to every\none.\nExperience of the world may be looked upon as a kind of text, to which\nreflection and knowledge form the commentary. Where there is great\ndeal of reflection and intellectual knowledge, and very little\nexperience, the result is like those books which have on each page two\nlines of text to forty lines of commentary. A great deal of experience\nwith little reflection and scant knowledge, gives us books like those\nof the _editio Bipontina_[1] where there are no notes and much that is\nunintelligible.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. A series of Greek, Latin and French\nclassics published at Zweibr\u00e4cken in the Palatinate, from and after\nthe year 1779. Cf. Butter, _Ueber die Bipontiner und die editiones\nBipontinae_.]\nThe advice here given is on a par with a rule recommended by\nPythagoras,--to review, every night before going to sleep, what we\nhave done during the day. To live at random, in the hurly-burly of\nbusiness or pleasure, without ever reflecting upon the past,--to go\non, as it were, pulling cotton off the reel of life,--is to have no\nclear idea of what we are about; and a man who lives in this state\nwill have chaos in his emotions and certain confusion in his thoughts;\nas is soon manifest by the abrupt and fragmentary character of his\nconversation, which becomes a kind of mincemeat. A man will be all the\nmore exposed to this fate in proportion as he lives a restless life\nin the world, amid a crowd of various impressions and with a\ncorrespondingly small amount of activity on the part of his own mind.\nAnd in this connection it will be in place to observe that, when\nevents and circumstances which have influenced us pass away in the\ncourse of time, we are unable to bring back and renew the particular\nmood or state of feeling which they aroused in us: but we can remember\nwhat we were led to say and do in regard to them; and thus form, as it\nwere, the result, expression and measure of those events. We should,\ntherefore, be careful to preserve the memory of our thoughts at\nimportant points in our life; and herein lies the great advantage of\nkeeping a journal.\nSECTION 9. To be self-sufficient, to be all in all to oneself, to\nwant for nothing, to be able to say _omnia mea mecum porto_--that is\nassuredly the chief qualification for happiness. Hence Aristotle's\nremark, [Greek: hae eudaimonia ton autarchon esti][1]--to be happy\nmeans to be self-sufficient--cannot be too often repeated. It is,\nat bottom, the same thought as is present in the very well-turned\nsentence from Chamfort:\n_Le bonheur n'est pas chose ais\u00e9e: il est tr\u00e8s difficile de le trouver\nen nous, et impossible de le trouver ailleurs_.\n[Footnote 1: _Eudem. Eth_. VII. ii. 37.]\nFor while a man cannot reckon with certainty upon anyone but himself,\nthe burdens and disadvantages, the dangers and annoyances, which arise\nfrom having to do with others, are not only countless but unavoidable.\nThere is no more mistaken path to happiness than worldliness, revelry,\n_high life_: for the whole object of it is to transform our miserable\nexistence into a succession of joys, delights and pleasures,--a\nprocess which cannot fail to result in disappointment and delusion;\non a par, in this respect, with its _obligato_ accompaniment, the\ninterchange of lies.[1]\n[Footnote 1: As our body is concealed by the clothes we wear, so our\nmind is veiled in lies. The veil is always there, and it is only\nthrough it that we can sometimes guess at what a man really thinks;\njust as from his clothes we arrive at the general shape of his body.]\nAll society necessarily involves, as the first condition of its\nexistence, mutual accommodation and restraint upon the part of its\nmembers. This means that the larger it is, the more insipid will be\nits tone. A man can be _himself_ only so long as he is alone; and if\nhe does not love solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only\nwhen he is alone that he is really free. Constraint is always present\nin society, like a companion of whom there is no riddance; and in\nproportion to the greatness of a man's individuality, it will be hard\nfor him to bear the sacrifices which all intercourse with others\ndemands, Solitude will be welcomed or endured or avoided, according as\na man's personal value is large or small,--the wretch feeling, when\nhe is alone, the whole burden of his misery; the great intellect\ndelighting in its greatness; and everyone, in short, being just what\nhe is.\nFurther, if a man stands high in Nature's lists, it is natural and\ninevitable that he should feel solitary. It will be an advantage to\nhim if his surroundings do not interfere with this feeling; for if he\nhas to see a great deal of other people who are not of like character\nwith himself, they will exercise a disturbing influence upon him,\nadverse to his peace of mind; they will rob him, in fact, of himself,\nand give him nothing to compensate for the loss.\nBut while Nature sets very wide differences between man and man in\nrespect both of morality and of intellect, society disregards and\neffaces them; or, rather, it sets up artificial differences in\ntheir stead,--gradations of rank and position, which are very often\ndiametrically opposed to those which Nature establishes. The result of\nthis arrangement is to elevate those whom Nature has placed low,\nand to depress the few who stand high. These latter, then, usually\nwithdraw from society, where, as soon as it is at all numerous,\nvulgarity reigns supreme.\nWhat offends a great intellect in society is the equality of rights,\nleading to equality of pretensions, which everyone enjoys; while at\nthe same time, inequality of capacity means a corresponding disparity\nof social power. So-called _good society_ recognizes every kind of\nclaim but that of intellect, which is a contraband article; and people\nare expected to exhibit an unlimited amount of patience towards every\nform of folly and stupidity, perversity and dullness; whilst personal\nmerit has to beg pardon, as it were, for being present, or else\nconceal itself altogether. Intellectual superiority offends by its\nvery existence, without any desire to do so.\nThe worst of what is called good society is not only that it offers us\nthe companionship of people who are unable to win either our praise or\nour affection, but that it does not allow of our being that which we\nnaturally are; it compels us, for the sake of harmony, to shrivel up,\nor even alter our shape altogether. Intellectual conversation, whether\ngrave or humorous, is only fit for intellectual society; it is\ndownright abhorrent to ordinary people, to please whom it is\nabsolutely necessary to be commonplace and dull. This demands an act\nof severe self-denial; we have to forfeit three-fourths of ourselves\nin order to become like other people. No doubt their company may be\nset down against our loss in this respect; but the more a man is\nworth, the more he will find that what he gains does not cover what he\nloses, and that the balance is on the debit side of the account; for\nthe people with whom he deals are generally bankrupt,--that is to say,\nthere is nothing to be got from their society which can compensate\neither for its boredom, annoyance and disagreeableness, or for the\nself-denial which it renders necessary. Accordingly, most society is\nso constituted as to offer a good profit to anyone who will exchange\nit for solitude.\nNor is this all. By way of providing a substitute for real--I mean\nintellectual--superiority, which is seldom to be met with, and\nintolerable when it is found, society has capriciously adopted a false\nkind of superiority, conventional in its character, and resting upon\narbitrary principles,--a tradition, as it were, handed down in the\nhigher circles, and, like a password, subject to alteration; I refer\nto _bon-ton_ fashion. Whenever this kind of superiority comes into\ncollision with the real kind, its weakness is manifest. Moreover, the\npresence of _good tone_ means the absence of _good sense_.\nNo man can be in _perfect accord_ with any one but himself--not even\nwith a friend or the partner of his life; differences of individuality\nand temperament are always bringing in some degree of discord, though\nit may be a very slight one. That genuine, profound peace of mind,\nthat perfect tranquillity of soul, which, next to health, is the\nhighest blessing the earth can give, is to be attained only in\nsolitude, and, as a permanent mood, only in complete retirement; and\nthen, if there is anything great and rich in the man's own self, his\nway of life is the happiest that may be found in this wretched world.\nLet me speak plainly. However close the bond of friendship, love,\nmarriage--a man, ultimately, looks to himself, to his own welfare\nalone; at most, to his child's too. The less necessity there is for\nyou to come into contact with mankind in general, in the relations\nwhether of business or of personal intimacy, the better off you are.\nLoneliness and solitude have their evils, it is true; but if you\ncannot feel them all at once, you can at least see where they lie; on\nthe other hand, society is _insidious_ in this respect; as in offering\nyou what appears to be the pastime of pleasing social intercourse, it\nworks great and often irreparable mischief. The young should early be\ntrained to bear being left alone; for it is a source of happiness and\npeace of mind.\nIt follows from this that a man is best off if he be thrown upon his\nown resources and can be all in all to himself; and Cicero goes so far\nas to say that a man who is in this condition cannot fail to be very\nhappy--_nemo potest non beatissimus esse qui est totus aptus ex sese,\nquique in se uno ponit omnia._[1] The more a man has in himself, the\nless others can be to him. The feeling of self-sufficiency! it is that\nwhich restrains those whose personal value is in itself great riches,\nfrom such considerable sacrifices as are demanded by intercourse with\nthe world, let alone, then, from actually practicing self-denial by\ngoing out of their way to seek it. Ordinary people are sociable and\ncomplaisant just from the very opposite feeling;--to bear others'\ncompany is easier for them than to bear their own. Moreover, respect\nis not paid in this world to that which has real merit; it is reserved\nfor that which has none. So retirement is at once a proof and a result\nof being distinguished by the possession of meritorious qualities. It\nwill therefore show real wisdom on the part of any one who is worth\nanything in himself, to limit his requirements as may be necessary, in\norder to preserve or extend his freedom, and,--since a man must come\ninto some relations with his fellow-men--to admit them to his intimacy\nas little as possible.\n[Footnote 1: _Paradoxa Stoidorum_: II.]\nI have said that people are rendered sociable by their ability to\nendure solitude, that is to say, their own society. They become\nsick of themselves. It is this vacuity of soul which drives them to\nintercourse with others,--to travels in foreign countries. Their mind\nis wanting in elasticity; it has no movement of its own, and so they\ntry to give it some,--by drink, for instance. How much drunkenness\nis due to this cause alone! They are always looking for some form of\nexcitement, of the strongest kind they can bear--the excitement of\nbeing with people of like nature with themselves; and if they fail\nin this, their mind sinks by its own weight, and they fall into a\ngrievous lethargy.[1] Such people, it may be said, possess only a\nsmall fraction of humanity in themselves; and it requires a great many\nof them put together to make up a fair amount of it,--to attain any\ndegree of consciousness as men. A man, in the full sense of the\nword,--a man _par excellence_--does not represent a fraction, but a\nwhole number: he is complete in himself.\n[Footnote 1: It is a well-known fact, that we can more easily bear up\nunder evils which fall upon a great many people besides ourselves.\nAs boredom seems to be an evil of this kind, people band together to\noffer it a common resistance. The love of life is at bottom only the\nfear of death; and, in the same way, the social impulse does not rest\ndirectly upon the love of society, but upon the fear of solitude; it\nis not alone the charm of being in others' company that people seek,\nit is the dreary oppression of being alone--the monotony of their own\nconsciousness--that they would avoid. They will do anything to escape\nit,--even tolerate bad companions, and put up with the feeling of\nconstraint which all society involves, in this case a very burdensome\none. But if aversion to such society conquers the aversion to being\nalone, they become accustomed to solitude and hardened to its\nimmediate effects. They no longer find solitude to be such a very bad\nthing, and settle down comfortably to it without any hankering after\nsociety;--and this, partly because it is only indirectly that they\nneed others' company, and partly because they have become accustomed\nto the benefits of being alone.]\nOrdinary society is, in this respect, very like the kind of music to\nbe obtained from an orchestra composed of Russian horns. Each horn has\nonly one note; and the music is produced by each note coming in just\nat the right moment. In the monotonous sound of a single horn, you\nhave a precise illustration of the effect of most people's minds. How\noften there seems to be only one thought there! and no room for any\nother. It is easy to see why people are so bored; and also why they\nare sociable, why they like to go about in crowds--why mankind is so\n_gregarious_. It is the monotony of his own nature that makes a man\nfind solitude intolerable. _Omnis stultitia laborat fastidio sui_:\nfolly is truly its own burden. Put a great many men together, and you\nmay get some result--some music from your horns!\nA man of intellect is like an artist who gives a concert without any\nhelp from anyone else, playing on a single instrument--a piano, say,\nwhich is a little orchestra in itself. Such a man is a little world in\nhimself; and the effect produced by various instruments together, he\nproduces single-handed, in the unity of his own consciousness. Like\nthe piano, he has no place in a symphony: he is a soloist and performs\nby himself,--in solitude, it may be; or, if in company with other\ninstruments, only as principal; or for setting the tone, as in\nsinging. However, those who are fond of society from time to time\nmay profit by this simile, and lay it down as a general rule that\ndeficiency of quality in those we meet may be to some extent\ncompensated by an increase in quantity. One man's company may be quite\nenough, if he is clever; but where you have only ordinary people to\ndeal with, it is advisable to have a great many of them, so that\nsome advantage may accrue by letting them all work together,--on the\nanalogy of the horns; and may Heaven grant you patience for your task!\nThat mental vacuity and barrenness of soul to which I have alluded, is\nresponsible for another misfortune. When men of the better class form\na society for promoting some noble or ideal aim, the result almost\nalways is that the innumerable mob of humanity comes crowding in too,\nas it always does everywhere, like vermin--their object being to try\nand get rid of boredom, or some other defect of their nature; and\nanything that will effect that, they seize upon at once, without the\nslightest discrimination. Some of them will slip into that society,\nor push themselves in, and then either soon destroy it altogether, or\nalter it so much that in the end it comes to have a purpose the exact\nopposite of that which it had at first.\nThis is not the only point of view from which the social impulse may\nbe regarded. On cold days people manage to get some warmth by crowding\ntogether; and you can warm your mind in the same way--by bringing\nit into contact with others. But a man who has a great deal of\nintellectual warmth in himself will stand in no need of such\nresources. I have written a little fable illustrating this: it may be\nfound elsewhere.[1] As a general rule, it may be said that a man's\nsociability stands very nearly in inverse ratio to his intellectual\nvalue: to say that \"so and so\" is very unsociable, is almost\ntantamount to saying that he is a man of great capacity.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. The passage to which Schopenhauer\nrefers is _Parerga_: vol. ii. \u00a7 413 (4th edition). The fable is of\ncertain porcupines, who huddled together for warmth on a cold day;\nbut as they began to prick one another with their quills, they were\nobliged to disperse. However the cold drove them together again, when\njust the same thing happened. At last, after many turns of huddling\nand dispersing, they discovered that they would be best off by\nremaining at a little distance from one another. In the same way,\nthe need of society drives the human porcupines together--only to be\nmutually repelled by the many prickly and disagreeable qualities of\ntheir nature. The moderate distance which they at last discover to be\nthe only tolerable condition of intercourse, is the code of politeness\nand fine manners; and those who transgress it are roughly told--in\nthe English phrase--_to keep their distance_. By this arrangement the\nmutual need of warmth is only very moderately satisfied,--but then\npeople do not get pricked. A man who has some heat in himself prefers\nto remain outside, where he will neither prick other people nor get\npricked himself.]\nSolitude is doubly advantageous to such a man. Firstly, it allows\nhim to be with himself, and, secondly, it prevents him being with\nothers--an advantage of great moment; for how much constraint,\nannoyance, and even danger there is in all intercourse with the world.\n_Tout notre mal_, says La Bruy\u00e8re, _vient de ne pouvoir \u00eatre seul_. It\nis really a very risky, nay, a fatal thing, to be sociable; because\nit means contact with natures, the great majority of which are bad\nmorally, and dull or perverse, intellectually. To be unsociable is not\nto care about such people; and to have enough in oneself to dispense\nwith the necessity of their company is a great piece of good fortune;\nbecause almost all our sufferings spring from having to do with other\npeople; and that destroys the peace of mind, which, as I have said,\ncomes next after health in the elements of happiness. Peace of mind\nis impossible without a considerable amount of solitude. The Cynics\nrenounced all private property in order to attain the bliss of having\nnothing to trouble them; and to renounce society with the same object\nis the wisest thing a man can do. Bernardin de Saint Pierre has the\nvery excellent and pertinent remark that to be sparing in regard\nto food is a means of health; in regard to society, a means of\ntranquillity--_la di\u00e8te des ailmens nous rend la sant\u00e9 du corps, et\ncelle des hommes la tranquillit\u00e9 de l'\u00e2me._ To be soon on friendly, or\neven affectionate, terms with solitude is like winning a gold mine;\nbut this is not something which everybody can do. The prime reason for\nsocial intercourse is mutual need; and as soon as that is satisfied,\nboredom drives people together once more. If it were not for these two\nreasons, a man would probably elect to remain alone; if only because\nsolitude is the sole condition of life which gives full play to\nthat feeling of exclusive importance which every man has in his own\neyes,--as if he were the only person in the world! a feeling which,\nin the throng and press of real life, soon shrivels up to nothing,\ngetting, at every step, a painful _d\u00e9menti_. From this point of view\nit may be said that solitude is the original and natural state of man,\nwhere, like another Adam, he is as happy as his nature will allow.\nBut still, had Adam no father or mother? There is another sense in\nwhich solitude is not the natural state; for, at his entrance into the\nworld, a man finds himself with parents, brothers, sisters, that is to\nsay, in society, and not alone. Accordingly it cannot be said that the\nlove of solitude is an original characteristic of human nature; it is\nrather the result of experience and reflection, and these in their\nturn depend upon the development of intellectual power, and increase\nwith the years.\nSpeaking generally, sociability stands in inverse ratio with age. A\nlittle child raises a piteous cry of fright if it is left alone for\nonly a few minutes; and later on, to be shut up by itself is a great\npunishment. Young people soon get on very friendly terms with one\nanother; it is only the few among them of any nobility of mind who are\nglad now and then to be alone;--but to spend the whole day thus would\nbe disagreeable. A grown-up man can easily do it; it is little trouble\nto him to be much alone, and it becomes less and less trouble as he\nadvances in years. An old man who has outlived all his friends, and is\neither indifferent or dead to the pleasures of life, is in his proper\nelement in solitude; and in individual cases the special tendency\nto retirement and seclusion will always be in direct proportion to\nintellectual capacity.\nFor this tendency is not, as I have said, a purely natural one; it\ndoes not come into existence as a direct need of human nature; it is\nrather the effect of the experience we go through, the product\nof reflection upon what our needs really are; proceeding, more\nespecially, from the insight we attain into the wretched stuff of\nwhich most people are made, whether you look at their morals or their\nintellects. The worst of it all is that, in the individual, moral and\nintellectual shortcomings are closely connected and play into each\nother's hands, so that all manner of disagreeable results are\nobtained, which make intercourse with most people not only unpleasant\nbut intolerable. Hence, though the world contains many things which\nare thoroughly bad, the worst thing in it is society. Even Voltaire,\nthat sociable Frenchman, was obliged to admit that there are\neverywhere crowds of people not worth talking to: _la terre est\ncouverte de gens qui ne m\u00e9ritent pas qu'on leur parle_. And Petrarch\ngives a similar reason for wishing to be alone--that tender spirit! so\nstrong and constant in his love of seclusion. The streams, the plains\nand woods know well, he says, how he has tried to escape the perverse\nand stupid people who have missed the way to heaven:--\n_Cercato ho sempre solitaria vita\n(Le rive il sanno, e le campagne e i boschi)\nPer fuggir quest' ingegni storti e loschi\nChe la strada del ciel' hanno smarrita_.\nHe pursues the same strain in that delightful book of his, _DeVita\nSolitaria_, which seems to have given Zimmerman the idea of his\ncelebrated work on _Solitude_. It is the secondary and indirect\ncharacter of the love of seclusion to which Chamfort alludes in the\nfollowing passage, couched in his sarcastic vein: _On dit quelquefois\nd'un homme qui vit seul, il n'aime pas la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. C'est souvent\ncomme si on disait d'un homme qu'il n'aime pas la promenade, sous le\npretexte qu'il ne se prom\u00e8ne pas volontiers le soir dans le for\u00eat de\nBondy_.\nYou will find a similar sentiment expressed by the Persian poet Sadi,\nin his _Garden of Roses. Since that time_, he says, _we have taken\nleave of society, preferring the path of seclusion; for there is\nsafety in solitude_. Angelus Silesius,[1] a very gentle and Christian\nwriter, confesses to the same feeling, in his own mythical language.\nHerod, he says, is the common enemy; and when, as with Joseph, God\nwarns us of danger, we fly from the world to solitude, from Bethlehem\nto Egypt; or else suffering and death await us!--\n_Herodes ist ein Feind; der Joseph der Verstand,\nDem machte Gott die Gefahr im Traum (in Geist) bekannt;\nDie Welt ist Bethlehem, Aegypten Einsamkeit,\nFleuch, meine Seele! fleuch, sonst stirbest du vor Leid_.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. Angelus Silesius, pseudonym for\nJohannes Scheffler, a physician and mystic poet of the seventeenth\ncentury (1624-77).]\nGiordano Bruno also declares himself a friend of seclusion. _Tanti\nuomini_, he says, _che in terra hanno voluto gustare vita\nceleste, dissero con una voce, \"ecce elongavi fugiens et mansi in\nsolitudine_\"--those who in this world have desired a foretaste of the\ndivine life, have always proclaimed with one voice:\n_Lo! then would I wander far off;\nI would lodge in the wilderness._[1]\n[Footnote 1: Psalms, lv. 7.]\nAnd in the work from which I have already quoted, Sadi says of\nhimself: _In disgust with my friends at Damascus, I withdrew into\nthe desert about Jerusalem, to seek the society of the beasts of the\nfield_. In short, the same thing has been said by all whom Prometheus\nhas formed out of better clay. What pleasure could they find in the\ncompany of people with whom their only common ground is just what is\nlowest and least noble in their own nature--the part of them that is\ncommonplace, trivial and vulgar? What do they want with people who\ncannot rise to a higher level, and for whom nothing remains but to\ndrag others down to theirs? for this is what they aim at. It is an\naristocratic feeling that is at the bottom of this propensity to\nseclusion and solitude.\nRascals are always sociable--more's the pity! and the chief sign that\na man has any nobility in his character is the little pleasure he\ntakes in others' company. He prefers solitude more and more, and, in\ncourse of time, comes to see that, with few exceptions, the world\noffers no choice beyond solitude on one side and vulgarity on the\nother. This may sound a hard thing to say; but even Angelus Silesius,\nwith all his Christian feelings of gentleness and love, was obliged to\nadmit the truth of it. However painful solitude may be, he says, be\ncareful not to be vulgar; for then you may find a desert everywhere:--\n_Die Einsamkeit ist noth: doch sei nur nicht gemein,\nSo kannst du \u00fcberall in einer W\u00fcste sein_.\nIt is natural for great minds--the true teachers of humanity--to care\nlittle about the constant company of others; just as little as the\nschoolmaster cares for joining in the gambols of the noisy crowd of\nboys which surround him. The mission of these great minds is to guide\nmankind over the sea of error to the haven of truth--to draw it forth\nfrom the dark abysses of a barbarous vulgarity up into the light of\nculture and refinement. Men of great intellect live in the world\nwithout really belonging to it; and so, from their earliest years,\nthey feel that there is a perceptible difference between them and\nother people. But it is only gradually, with the lapse of years,\nthat they come to a clear understanding of their position. Their\nintellectual isolation is then reinforced by actual seclusion in their\nmanner of life; they let no one approach who is not in some degree\nemancipated from the prevailing vulgarity.\nFrom what has been said it is obvious that the love of solitude is\nnot a direct, original impulse in human nature, but rather something\nsecondary and of gradual growth. It is the more distinguishing feature\nof nobler minds, developed not without some conquest of natural\ndesires, and now and then in actual opposition to the promptings of\nMephistopheles--bidding you exchange a morose and soul-destroying\nsolitude for life amongst men, for society; even the worst, he says,\nwill give a sense of human fellowship:--\n_H\u00f6r' auf mit deinem Gram zu spielen,\nDer, wie ein Geier, dir am Leben frisst:\nDie schlechteste Gesellschaft l\u00e4sst dich f\u00fchlen\nDass du ein Mensch mit Menschen bist.[1]_\n[Footnote 1: Goethe's _Faust_, Part I., 1281-5.]\nTo be alone is the fate of all great minds--a fate deplored at times,\nbut still always chosen as the less grievous of two evils. As\nthe years increase, it always becomes easier to say, Dare to be\nwise--_sapere aude_. And after sixty, the inclination to be alone\ngrows into a kind of real, natural instinct; for at that age\neverything combines in favor of it. The strongest impulse--the love of\nwoman's society--has little or no effect; it is the sexless condition\nof old age which lays the foundation of a certain self-sufficiency,\nand that gradually absorbs all desire for others' company. A thousand\nillusions and follies are overcome; the active years of life are\nin most cases gone; a man has no more expectations or plans or\nintentions. The generation to which he belonged has passed away, and a\nnew race has sprung up which looks upon him as essentially outside its\nsphere of activity. And then the years pass more quickly as we become\nolder, and we want to devote our remaining time to the intellectual\nrather than to the practical side of life. For, provided that the mind\nretains its faculties, the amount of knowledge and experience we have\nacquired, together with the facility we have gained in the use of our\npowers, makes it then more than ever easy and interesting to us to\npursue the study of any subject. A thousand things become clear which\nwere formerly enveloped in obscurity, and results are obtained which\ngive a feeling of difficulties overcome. From long experience of men,\nwe cease to expect much from them; we find that, on the whole, people\ndo not gain by a nearer acquaintance; and that--apart from a few rare\nand fortunate exceptions--we have come across none but defective\nspecimens of human nature which it is advisable to leave in peace.\nWe are no more subject to the ordinary illusions of life; and as, in\nindividual instances, we soon see what a man is made of, we seldom\nfeel any inclination to come into closer relations with him. Finally,\nisolation--our own society--has become a habit, as it were a second\nnature to us, more especially if we have been on friendly terms with\nit from our youth up. The love of solitude which was formerly indulged\nonly at the expense of our desire for society, has now come to be the\nsimple quality of our natural disposition--the element proper to our\nlife, as water to a fish. This is why anyone who possesses a unique\nindividuality--unlike others and therefore necessarily isolated--feels\nthat, as he becomes older, his position is no longer so burdensome as\nwhen he was young.\nFor, as a matter of fact, this very genuine privilege of old age is\none which can be enjoyed only if a man is possessed of a certain\namount of intellect; it will be appreciated most of all where there is\nreal mental power; but in some degree by every one. It is only people\nof very barren and vulgar nature who will be just as sociable in their\nold age as they were in their youth. But then they become troublesome\nto a society to which they are no longer suited, and, at most, manage\nto be tolerated; whereas, they were formerly in great request.\nThere is another aspect of this inverse proportion between age and\nsociability--the way in which it conduces to education. The younger\nthat people are, the more in every respect they have to learn; and it\nis just in youth that Nature provides a system of mutual education,\nso that mere intercourse with others, at that time of life, carries\ninstruction with it. Human society, from this point of view, resembles\na huge academy of learning, on the Bell and Lancaster system, opposed\nto the system of education by means of books and schools, as something\nartificial and contrary to the institutions of Nature. It is therefore\na very suitable arrangement that, in his young days, a man should be\na very diligent student at the place of learning provided by Nature\nherself.\nBut there is nothing in life which has not some drawback--_nihil est\nab omni parte beatum_, as Horace says; or, in the words of an Indian\nproverb, _no lotus without a stalk_. Seclusion, which has so many\nadvantages, has also its little annoyances and drawbacks, which are\nsmall, however, in comparison with those of society; hence anyone who\nis worth much in himself will get on better without other people than\nwith them. But amongst the disadvantages of seclusion there is one\nwhich is not so easy to see as the rest. It is this: when people\nremain indoors all day, they become physically very sensitive to\natmospheric changes, so that every little draught is enough to make\nthem ill; so with our temper; a long course of seclusion makes it so\nsensitive that the most trivial incidents, words, or even looks, are\nsufficient to disturb or to vex and offend us--little things which are\nunnoticed by those who live in the turmoil of life.\nWhen you find human society disagreeable and feel yourself justified\nin flying to solitude, you can be so constituted as to be unable to\nbear the depression of it for any length of time, which will probably\nbe the case if you are young. Let me advise you, then, to form the\nhabit of taking some of your solitude with you into society, to learn\nto be to some extent alone even though you are in company; not to say\nat once what you think, and, on the other hand, not to attach too\nprecise a meaning to what others say; rather, not to expect much of\nthem, either morally or intellectually, and to strengthen yourself in\nthe feeling of indifference to their opinion, which is the surest way\nof always practicing a praiseworthy toleration. If you do that, you\nwill not live so much with other people, though you may appear to move\namongst them: your relation to them will be of a purely objective\ncharacter. This precaution will keep you from too close contact with\nsociety, and therefore secure you against being contaminated or even\noutraged by it.[1] Society is in this respect like a fire--the wise\nman warming himself at a proper distance from it; not coming too\nclose, like the fool, who, on getting scorched, runs away and shivers\nin solitude, loud in his complaint that the fire burns.\n[Footnote 1: This restricted, or, as it were, entrenched kind of\nsociability has been dramatically illustrated in a play--well worth\nreading--of Moratin's, entitled _El Caf\u00e9 o sea la Comedia Nuova_ (The\nCafe or the New Comedy), chiefly by one of the characters, Don Pedro\nand especially in the second and third scenes of the first act.]\nSECTION 10. _Envy_ is natural to man; and still, it is at once a vice\nand a source of misery.[1] We should treat it as the enemy of our\nhappiness, and stifle it like an evil thought. This is the advice\ngiven by Seneca; as he well puts it, we shall be pleased with what we\nhave, if we avoid the self-torture of comparing our own lot with\nsome other and happier one--_nostra nos sine comparatione delectent;\nnunquam erit felix quem torquebit felicior.[2]_ And again, _quum\nadspexeris quot te antecedent, cogita quot sequantur_[3]--if a great\nmany people appear to be better off than yourself, think how many\nthere are in a worse position. It is a fact that if real calamity\ncomes upon us, the most effective consolation--though it springs from\nthe same source as envy--is just the thought of greater misfortunes\nthan ours; and the next best is the society of those who are in the\nsame luck as we--the partners of our sorrows.\n[Footnote 1: Envy shows how unhappy people are; and their constant\nattention to what others do and leave undone, how much they are\nbored.]\n[Footnote 2: _De Ira_: iii., 30.]\n[Footnote 3: Epist. xv.]\nSo much for the envy which we may feel towards others. As regards the\nenvy which we may excite in them, it should always be remembered that\nno form of hatred is so implacable as the hatred that comes from envy;\nand therefore we should always carefully refrain from doing anything\nto rouse it; nay, as with many another form of vice, it is better\naltogether to renounce any pleasure there may be in it, because of the\nserious nature of its consequences.\nAristocracies are of three kinds: (1) of birth and rank; (2)\nof wealth; and (3) of intellect. The last is really the most\ndistinguished of the three, and its claim to occupy the first position\ncomes to be recognized, if it is only allowed time to work. So eminent\na king as Frederick the Great admitted it--_les \u00e2mes privilegi\u00e9es\nrangent \u00e0 l'\u00e9gal des souverains_, as he said to his chamberlain, when\nthe latter expressed his surprise that Voltaire should have a seat\nat the table reserved for kings and princes, whilst ministers and\ngenerals were relegated to the chamberlain's.\nEvery one of these aristocracies is surrounded by a host of envious\npersons. If you belong to one of them, they will be secretly\nembittered against you; and unless they are restrained by fear, they\nwill always be anxious to let you understand that _you are no better\nthan they_. It is by their anxiety to let you know this, that they\nbetray how greatly they are conscious that the opposite is the truth.\nThe line of conduct to be pursued if you are exposed to envy, is to\nkeep the envious persons at a distance, and, as far as possible, avoid\nall contact with them, so that there may be a wide gulf fixed between\nyou and them; if this cannot be done, to bear their attacks with the\ngreatest composure. In the latter case, the very thing that provokes\nthe attack will also neutralize it. This is what appears to be\ngenerally done.\nThe members of one of these aristocracies usually get on very well\nwith those of another, and there is no call for envy between them,\nbecause their several privileges effect an equipoise.\nSECTION 11. Give mature and repeated consideration to any plan before\nyou proceed to carry it out; and even after you have thoroughly turned\nit over in your mind, make some concession to the incompetency of\nhuman judgment; for it may always happen that circumstances which\ncannot be investigated or foreseen, will come in and upset the whole\nof your calculation. This is a reflection that will always influence\nthe negative side of the balance--a kind of warning to refrain from\nunnecessary action in matters of importance--_quieta non movere._ But\nhaving once made up your mind and begun your work, you must let it\nrun its course and abide the result--not worry yourself by fresh\nreflections on what is already accomplished, or by a renewal of your\nscruples on the score of possible danger: free your mind from the\nsubject altogether, and refuse to go into it again, secure in the\nthought that you gave it mature attention at the proper time. This is\nthe same advice as is given by an Italian proverb--_legala bene e poi\nlascia la andare_--which Goethe has translated thus: See well to your\ngirths, and then ride on boldly.[1]\n[Footnote 1: It may be observed, in passing, that a great many of\nthe maxims which Goethe puts under the head of _Proverbial_, are\ntranslations from the Italian.]\nAnd if, notwithstanding that, you fail, it is because human affairs\nare the sport of chance and error. Socrates, the wisest of men, needed\nthe warning voice of his good genius, or [Greek: daimonion], to enable\nhim to do what was right in regard to his own personal affairs, or at\nany rate, to avoid mistakes; which argues that the human intellect is\nincompetent for the purpose. There is a saying--which is reported to\nhave originated with one of the Popes--that when misfortune happens to\nus, the blame of it, at least in some degree, attaches to ourselves.\nIf this is not true absolutely and in every instance, it is certainly\ntrue in the great majority of cases. It even looks as if this truth\nhad a great deal to do with the effort people make as far as possible\nto conceal their misfortunes, and to put the best face they can upon\nthem, for fear lest their misfortunes may show how much they are to\nblame.\nSECTION 12.\nIn the case of a misfortune which has already happened and therefore\ncannot be altered, you should not allow yourself to think that it\nmight have been otherwise; still less, that it might have been avoided\nby such and such means; for reflections of this kind will only add\nto your distress and make it intolerable, so that you will become a\ntormentor to yourself--[Greek: heautontimoroumeaeos]. It is better to\nfollow the example of King David; who, as long as his son lay on the\nbed of sickness, assailed Jehovah with unceasing supplications and\nentreaties for his recovery; but when he was dead, snapped his fingers\nand thought no more of it. If you are not light-hearted enough for\nthat, you can take refuge in fatalism, and have the great truth\nrevealed to you that everything which happens is the result of\nnecessity, and therefore inevitable.\nHowever good this advice may be, it is one-sided and partial. In\nrelieving and quieting us for the moment, it is no doubt effective\nenough; but when our misfortunes have resulted--as is usually the\ncase--from our own carelessness or folly, or, at any rate, partly by\nour own fault, it is a good thing to consider how they might have\nbeen avoided, and to consider it often in spite of its being a tender\nsubject--a salutary form of self-discipline, which will make us wiser\nand better men for the future. If we have made obvious mistakes, we\nshould not try, as we generally do, to gloss them over, or to find\nsomething to excuse or extenuate them; we should admit to ourselves\nthat we have committed faults, and open our eyes wide to all their\nenormity, in order that we may firmly resolve to avoid them in time to\ncome. To be sure, that means a great deal of self-inflicted pain, in\nthe shape of discontent, but it should be remembered that to spare\nthe rod is to spoil the child--[Greek: ho mae dareis anthropos ou\npaideuetai].[1]\n[Footnote 1: Menander. Monost: 422.]\nSECTION 13. In all matters affecting our weal or woe, we should be\ncareful not to let our imagination run away with us, and build no\ncastles in the air. In the first place, they are expensive to build,\nbecause we have to pull them down again immediately, and that is\na source of grief. We should be still more on our guard against\ndistressing our hearts by depicting possible misfortunes. If these\nwere misfortunes of a purely imaginary kind, or very remote and\nunlikely, we should at once see, on awaking from our dream, that the\nwhole thing was mere illusion; we should rejoice all the more in\na reality better than our dreams, or at most, be warned against\nmisfortunes which, though very remote, were still possible. These,\nhowever, are not the sort of playthings in which imagination delights;\nit is only in idle hours that we build castles in the air, and they\nare always of a pleasing description. The matter which goes to form\ngloomy dreams are mischances which to some extent really threaten us,\nthough it be from some distance; imagination makes us look larger and\nnearer and more terrible than they are in reality. This is a kind of\ndream which cannot be so readily shaken off on awaking as a pleasant\none; for a pleasant dream is soon dispelled by reality, leaving, at\nmost, a feeble hope lying in the lap of possibility. Once we have\nabandoned ourselves to a fit of the blues, visions are conjured up\nwhich do not so easily vanish again; for it is always just possible\nthat the visions may be realized. But we are not always able to\nestimate the exact degree of possibility: possibility may easily\npass into probability; and thus we deliver ourselves up to torture.\nTherefore we should be careful not to be over-anxious on any\nmatter affecting our weal or our woe, not to carry our anxiety to\nunreasonable or injudicious limits; but coolly and dispassionately to\ndeliberate upon the matter, as though it were an abstract question\nwhich did not touch us in particular. We should give no play to\nimagination here; for imagination is not judgment--it only conjures up\nvisions, inducing an unprofitable and often very painful mood.\nThe rule on which I am here insisting should be most carefully\nobserved towards evening. For as darkness makes us timid and apt to\nsee terrifying shapes everywhere, there is something similar in the\neffect of indistinct thought; and uncertainty always brings with it a\nsense of danger. Hence, towards evening, when our powers of thought\nand judgment are relaxed,--at the hour, as it were, of subjective\ndarkness,--the intellect becomes tired, easily confused, and unable\nto get at the bottom of things; and if, in that state, we meditate\non matters of personal interest to ourselves, they soon assume a\ndangerous and terrifying aspect. This is mostly the case at night,\nwhen we are in bed; for then the mind is fully relaxed, and the power\nof judgment quite unequal to its duties; but imagination is still\nawake. Night gives a black look to everything, whatever it may be.\nThis is why our thoughts, just before we go to sleep, or as we lie\nawake through the hours of the night, are usually such confusions and\nperversions of facts as dreams themselves; and when our thoughts at\nthat time are concentrated upon our own concerns, they are generally\nas black and monstrous as possible. In the morning all such nightmares\nvanish like dreams: as the Spanish proverb has it, _noche tinta,\nbianco el dia_--the night is colored, the day is white. But even\ntowards nightfall, as soon as the candles are lit, the mind, like the\neye, no longer sees things so clearly as by day: it is a time unsuited\nto serious meditation, especially on unpleasant subjects. The morning\nis the proper time for that--as indeed for all efforts without\nexception, whether mental or bodily. For the morning is the youth of\nthe day, when everything is bright, fresh, and easy of attainment;\nwe feel strong then, and all our faculties are completely at our\ndisposal. Do not shorten the morning by getting up late, or waste it\nin unworthy occupations or in talk; look upon it as the quintessence\nof life, as to a certain extent sacred. Evening is like old age: we\nare languid, talkative, silly. Each day is a little life: every waking\nand rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every\ngoing to rest and sleep a little death.\nBut condition of health, sleep, nourishment, temperature, weather,\nsurroundings, and much else that is purely external, have, in general,\nan important influence upon our mood and therefore upon our thoughts.\nHence both our view of any matter and our capacity for any work are\nvery much subject to time and place. So it is best to profit by a good\nmood--for how seldom it comes!--\n_Nehmt die gute Stimmung wahr,\nDenn sie kommt so selten_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: Goethe.]\nWe are not always able to form new ideas about; our surroundings, or\nto command original thoughts: they come if they will, and when they\nwill. And so, too, we cannot always succeed in completely considering\nsome personal matter at the precise time at which we have determined\nbeforehand to consider it, and just when we set ourselves to do\nso. For the peculiar train of thought which is favorable to it may\nsuddenly become active without any special call being made upon\nit, and we may then follow it up with keen interest. In this way\nreflection, too, chooses its own time.\nThis reining-in of the imagination which I am recommending, will also\nforbid us to summon up the memory of the past misfortune, to paint\na dark picture of the injustice or harm that has been done us, the\nlosses we have sustained, the insults, slights and annoyances to which\nwe have been exposed: for to do that is to rouse into fresh life all\nthose hateful passions long laid asleep--the anger and resentment\nwhich disturb and pollute our nature. In an excellent parable,\nProclus, the Neoplatonist, points out how in every town the mob dwells\nside by side with those who are rich and distinguished: so, too, in\nevery man, be he never so noble and dignified, there is, in the depth\nof his nature, a mob of low and vulgar desires which constitute him an\nanimal. It will not do to let this mob revolt or even so much as peep\nforth from its hiding-place; it is hideous of mien, and its rebel\nleaders are those flights of imagination which I have been describing.\nThe smallest annoyance, whether it comes from our fellow-men or from\nthe things around us, may swell up into a monster of dreadful aspect,\nputting us at our wits' end--and all because we go on brooding over\nour troubles and painting them in the most glaring colors and on the\nlargest scale. It is much better to take a very calm and prosaic view\nof what is disagreeable; for that is the easiest way of bearing it.\nIf you hold small objects close to your eyes, you limit your field of\nvision and shut out the world. And, in the same way, the people or the\nthings which stand nearest, even though they are of the very smallest\nconsequence, are apt to claim an amount of attention much beyond\ntheir due, occupying us disagreeably, and leaving no room for serious\nthoughts and affairs of importance. We ought to work against this\ntendency.\nSECTION 14. The sight of things which do not belong to us is very apt\nto raise the thought: _Ah, if that were only mine_! making us sensible\nof our privation. Instead of that we should do better by more\nfrequently putting to ourselves the opposite case: _Ah, if that were\nnot mine_. What I mean is that we should sometimes try to look upon\nour possessions in the light in which they would appear if we had lost\nthem; whatever they may be, property, health, friends, a wife or child\nor someone else we love, our horse or our dog--it is usually only when\nwe have lost them that we begin to find out their value. But if we\ncome to look at things in the way I recommend, we shall be doubly the\ngainers; we shall at once get more pleasure out of them than we did\nbefore, and we shall do everything in our power to prevent the loss\nof them; for instance, by not risking our property, or angering our\nfriends, or exposing our wives to temptation, or being careless about\nour children's health, and so on.\nWe often try to banish the gloom and despondency of the present by\nspeculating upon our chances of success in the future; a process which\nleads us to invent a great many chimerical hopes. Every one of them\ncontains the germ of illusion, and disappointment is inevitable when\nour hopes are shattered by the hard facts of life.\nIt is less hurtful to take the chances of misfortune as a theme for\nspeculation; because, in doing so, we provide ourselves at once with\nmeasures of precaution against it, and a pleasant surprise when it\nfails to make its appearance. Is it not a fact that we always feel a\nmarked improvement in our spirits when we begin to get over a period\nof anxiety? I may go further and say that there is some use in\noccasionally looking upon terrible misfortunes--such as might happen\nto us--as though they had actually happened, for then the trivial\nreverses which subsequently come in reality, are much easier to\nbear. It is a source of consolation to look back upon those great\nmisfortunes which never happened. But in following out this rule,\ncare must be taken not to neglect what I have said in the preceding\nsection.\nSECTION 15. The things which engage our attention--whether they are\nmatters of business or ordinary events--are of such diverse kinds,\nthat, if taken quite separately and in no fixed order or relation,\nthey present a medley of the most glaring contrasts, with nothing in\ncommon, except that they one and all affect us in particular. There\nmust be a corresponding abruptness in the thoughts and anxieties which\nthese various matters arouse in us, if our thoughts are to be in\nkeeping with their various subjects. Therefore, in setting about\nanything, the first step is to withdraw our attention from everything\nelse: this will enable us to attend to each matter at its own time,\nand to enjoy or put up with it, quite apart from any thought of our\nremaining interests. Our thoughts must be arranged, as it were, in\nlittle drawers, so that we may open one without disturbing any of the\nothers.\nIn this way we can keep the heavy burden of anxiety from weighing upon\nus so much as to spoil the little pleasures of the present, or from\nrobbing us of our rest; otherwise the consideration of one matter will\ninterfere with every other, and attention to some important business\nmay lead us to neglect many affairs which happen to be of less moment.\nIt is most important for everyone who is capable of higher and nobler\nthoughts to keep their mind from being so completely engrossed with\nprivate affairs and vulgar troubles as to let them take up all his\nattention and crowd out worthier matter; for that is, in a very real\nsense, to lose sight of the true end of life--_propter vitam vivendi\nperdere causas_.\nOf course for this--as for so much else--self-control is necessary;\nwithout it, we cannot manage ourselves in the way I have described.\nAnd self-control may not appear so very difficult, if we consider that\nevery man has to submit to a great deal of very severe control on the\npart of his surroundings, and that without it no form of existence\nis possible. Further, a little self-control at the right moment may\nprevent much subsequent compulsion at the hands of others; just as a\nvery small section of a circle close to the centre may correspond to\na part near the circumference a hundred times as large. Nothing\nwill protect us from external compulsion so much as the control of\nourselves; and, as Seneca says, to submit yourself to reason is\nthe way to make everything else submit to you--_si tibi vis omnia\nsubjicere, te subjice rationi_. Self-control, too, is something which\nwe have in our own power; and if the worst comes to the worst, and it\ntouches us in a very sensitive part, we can always relax its severity.\nBut other people will pay no regard to our feelings, if they have\nto use compulsion, and we shall be treated without pity or mercy.\nTherefore it will be prudent to anticipate compulsion by self-control.\nSECTION 16. We must set limits to our wishes, curb our desires,\nmoderate our anger, always remembering that an individual can attain\nonly an infinitesimal share in anything that is worth having; and\nthat, on the other hand, everyone must incur many of the ills of life;\nin a word, we must bear and forbear--_abstinere et sustinere_; and\nif we fail to observe this rule, no position of wealth or power will\nprevent us from feeling wretched. This is what Horace means when he\nrecommends us to study carefully and inquire diligently what will\nbest promote a tranquil life--not to be always agitated by fruitless\ndesires and fears and hopes for things, which, after all, are not\nworth very much:--\n_Inter cuncta leges et percontabere doctos\nQua ratione queas traducere leniter aevum;\nNe te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,\nNe pavor, et rerum mediocriter utilium spes.[1]_\n[Footnote 1: Epist. I. xviii. 97.]\nSECTION 17. Life consists in movement, says Aristotle; and he is\nobviously right. We exist, physically, because our organism is the\nseat of constant motion; and if we are to exist intellectually, it can\nonly be by means of continual occupation--no matter with what so long\nas it is some form of practical or mental activity. You may see that\nthis is so by the way in which people who have no work or nothing to\nthink about, immediately begin to beat the devil's tattoo with their\nknuckles or a stick or anything that comes handy. The truth is, that\nour nature is essentially _restless_ in its character: we very soon\nget tired of having nothing to do; it is intolerable boredom. This\nimpulse to activity should be regulated, and some sort of method\nintroduced into it, which of itself will enhance the satisfaction we\nobtain. Activity!--doing something, if possible creating something, at\nany rate learning something--how fortunate it is that men cannot exist\nwithout that! A man wants to use his strength, to see, if he can, what\neffect it will produce; and he will get the most complete satisfaction\nof this desire if he can make or construct something--be it a book or\na basket. There is a direct pleasure in seeing work grow under one's\nhands day by day, until at last it is finished. This is the pleasure\nattaching to a work of art or a manuscript, or even mere manual labor;\nand, of course, the higher the work, the greater pleasure it will\ngive.\nFrom this point of view, those are happiest of all who are conscious\nof the power to produce great works animated by some significant\npurpose: it gives a higher kind of interest--a sort of rare flavor--to\nthe whole of their life, which, by its absence from the life of the\nordinary man, makes it, in comparison, something very insipid. For\nrichly endowed natures, life and the world have a special interest\nbeyond the mere everyday personal interest which so many others share;\nand something higher than that--a formal interest. It is from life and\nthe world that they get the material for their works; and as soon\nas they are freed from the pressure of personal needs, it is to\nthe diligent collection of material that they devote their whole\nexistence. So with their intellect: it is to some extent of a two-fold\ncharacter, and devoted partly to the ordinary affairs of every\nday--those matters of will which are common to them and the rest of\nmankind, and partly to their peculiar work--the pure and objective\ncontemplation of existence. And while, on the stage of the world, most\nmen play their little part and then pass away, the genius lives a\ndouble life, at once an actor and a spectator.\nLet everyone, then, do something, according to the measure of his\ncapacities. To have no regular work, no set sphere of activity--what a\nmiserable thing it is! How often long travels undertaken for pleasure\nmake a man downright unhappy; because the absence of anything that can\nbe called occupation forces him, as it were, out of his right element.\nEffort, struggles with difficulties! that is as natural to a man as\ngrubbing in the ground is to a mole. To have all his wants satisfied\nis something intolerable--the feeling of stagnation which comes\nfrom pleasures that last too long. To overcome difficulties is\nto experience the full delight of existence, no matter where the\nobstacles are encountered; whether in the affairs of life, in commerce\nor business; or in mental effort--the spirit of inquiry that tries\nto master its subject. There is always something pleasurable in the\nstruggle and the victory. And if a man has no opportunity to excite\nhimself, he will do what he can to create one, and according to his\nindividual bent, he will hunt or play Cup and Ball: or led on by this\nunsuspected element in his nature, he will pick a quarrel with some\none, or hatch a plot or intrigue, or take to swindling and rascally\ncourses generally--all to put an end to a state of repose which is\nintolerable. As I have remarked, _difficilis in otio quies_--it is\ndifficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do.\nSECTION 18. A man should avoid being led on by the phantoms of his\nimagination. This is not the same thing as to submit to the guidance\nof ideas clearly thought out: and yet these are rules of life which\nmost people pervert. If you examine closely into the circumstances\nwhich, in any deliberation, ultimately turn the scale in favor of\nsome particular course, you will generally find that the decision is\ninfluenced, not by any clear arrangement of ideas leading to a formal\njudgment, but by some fanciful picture which seems to stand for one of\nthe alternatives in question.\nIn one of Voltaire's or Diderot's romances,--I forget the precise\nreference,--the hero, standing like a young Hercules at the parting\nof ways, can see no other representation of Virtue than his old tutor\nholding a snuff-box in his left hand, from which he takes a pinch\nand moralizes; whilst Vice appears in the shape of his mother's\nchambermaid. It is in youth, more especially, that the goal of our\nefforts comes to be a fanciful picture of happiness, which continues\nto hover before our eyes sometimes for half and even for the whole of\nour life--a sort of mocking spirit; for when we think our dream is to\nbe realized, the picture fades away, leaving us the knowledge that\nnothing of what it promised is actually accomplished. How often this\nis so with the visions of domesticity--the detailed picture of what\nour home will be like; or, of life among our fellow-citizens or in\nsociety; or, again, of living in the country--the kind of house we\nshall have, its surroundings, the marks of honor and respect that will\nbe paid to us, and so on,--whatever our hobby may be; _chaque fou a\nsa marotte_. It is often the same, too, with our dreams about one we\nlove. And this is all quite natural; for the visions we conjure up\naffect us directly, as though they were real objects; and so they\nexercise a more immediate influence upon our will than an abstract\nidea, which gives merely a vague, general outline, devoid of details;\nand the details are just the real part of it. We can be only\nindirectly affected by an abstract idea, and yet it is the abstract\nidea alone which will do as much as it promises; and it is the\nfunction of education to teach us to put our trust in it. Of course\nthe abstract idea must be occasionally explained--paraphrased, as it\nwere--by the aid of pictures; but discreetly, _cum grano salis_.\nSECTION 19. The preceding rule may be taken as a special case of the\nmore general maxim, that a man should never let himself be mastered\nby the impressions of the moment, or indeed by outward appearances at\nall, which are incomparably more powerful in their effects than the\nmere play of thought or a train of ideas; not because these momentary\nimpressions are rich in virtue of the data they supply,--it is often\njust the contrary,--but because they are something palpable to the\nsenses and direct in their working; they forcibly invade our mind,\ndisturbing our repose and shattering our resolutions.\nIt is easy to understand that the thing which lies before our very\neyes will produce the whole of its effect at once, but that time and\nleisure are necessary for the working of thought and the appreciation\nof argument, as it is impossible to think of everything at one and the\nsame moment. This is why we are so allured by pleasure, in spite of\nall our determination to resist it; or so much annoyed by a criticism,\neven though we know that its author it totally incompetent to\njudge; or so irritated by an insult, though it comes from some very\ncontemptible quarter. In the same way, to mention no other instances,\nten reasons for thinking that there is no danger may be outweighed by\none mistaken notion that it is actually at hand. All this shows the\nradical unreason of human nature. Women frequently succumb altogether\nto this predominating influence of present impressions, and there are\nfew men so overweighted with reason as to escape suffering from a\nsimilar cause.\nIf it is impossible to resist the effects of some external influence\nby the mere play of thought, the best thing to do is to neutralize it\nby some contrary influence; for example, the effect of an insult may\nbe overcome by seeking the society of those who have a good opinion of\nus; and the unpleasant sensation of imminent danger may be avoided by\nfixing our attention on the means of warding it off.\nLeibnitz[1] tells of an Italian who managed to bear up under the\ntortures of the rack by never for a moment ceasing to think of the\ngallows which would have awaited him, had he revealed his secret; he\nkept on crying out: _I see it! I see it_!--afterwards explaining that\nthis was part of his plan.\n[Footnote 1: _Nouveaux Essais_. Liv. I. ch. 2. Sec. 11.]\nIt is from some such reason as this, that we find it so difficult to\nstand alone in a matter of opinion,--not to be made irresolute by the\nfact that everyone else disagrees with us and acts accordingly, even\nthough we are quite sure that they are in the wrong. Take the case of\na fugitive king who is trying to avoid capture; how much consolation\nhe must find in the ceremonious and submissive attitude of a faithful\nfollower, exhibited secretly so as not to betray his master's strict\n_incognito_; it must be almost necessary to prevent him doubting his\nown existence.\nSECTION 20. In the first part of this work I have insisted upon the\ngreat value of _health_ as the chief and most important element in\nhappiness. Let me emphasize and confirm what I have there said by\ngiving a few general rules as to its preservation.\nThe way to harden the body is to impose a great deal of labor and\neffort upon it in the days of good health,--to exercise it, both as a\nwhole and in its several parts, and to habituate it to withstand all\nkinds of noxious influences. But on the appearance of an illness or\ndisorder, either in the body as a whole or in many of its parts, a\ncontrary course should be taken, and every means used to nurse the\nbody, or the part of it which is affected, and to spare it any effort;\nfor what is ailing and debilitated cannot be hardened.\nThe muscles may be strengthened by a vigorous use of them; but not so\nthe nerves; they are weakened by it. Therefore, while exercising the\nmuscles in every way that is suitable, care should be taken to spare\nthe nerves as much as possible. The eyes, for instance, should be\nprotected from too strong a light,--especially when it is reflected\nlight,--from any straining of them in the dark, or from the\nlong-continued examination of minute objects; and the ears from too\nloud sounds. Above all, the brain should never be forced, or used too\nmuch, or at the wrong time; let it have a rest during digestion; for\nthen the same vital energy which forms thoughts in the brain has a\ngreat deal of work to do elsewhere,--I mean in the digestive organs,\nwhere it prepares chyme and chyle. For similar reasons, the brain\nshould never be used during, or immediately after, violent muscular\nexercise. For the motor nerves are in this respect on a par with the\nsensory nerves; the pain felt when a limb is wounded has its seat in\nthe brain; and, in the same way, it is not really our legs and arms\nwhich work and move,--it is the brain, or, more strictly, that part of\nit which, through the medium of the spine, excites the nerves in the\nlimbs and sets them in motion. Accordingly, when our arms and legs\nfeel tired, the true seat of this feeling is in the brain. This is why\nit is only in connection with those muscles which are set in motion\nconsciously and voluntarily,--in other words, depend for their action\nupon the brain,--that any feeling of fatigue can arise; this is not\nthe case with those muscles which work involuntarily, like the heart.\nIt is obvious, then, that injury is done to the brain if violent\nmuscular exercise and intellectual exertion are forced upon it at the\nsame moment, or at very short intervals.\nWhat I say stands in no contradiction with the fact that at the\nbeginning of a walk, or at any period of a short stroll, there often\ncomes a feeling of enhanced intellectual vigor. The parts of the brain\nthat come into play have had no time to become tired; and besides,\nslight muscular exercise conduces to activity of the respiratory\norgans, and causes a purer and more oxydated supply of arterial blood\nto mount to the brain.\nIt is most important to allow the brain the full measure of sleep\nwhich is required to restore it; for sleep is to a man's whole nature\nwhat winding up is to a clock.[1] This measure will vary directly with\nthe development and activity of the brain; to overstep the measure is\nmere waste of time, because if that is done, sleep gains only so much\nin length as it loses in depth.[2]\n[Footnote 1: _Of. Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_, 4th Edition. Bk.\nII. pp. 236-40.]\n[Footnote: 2: _Cf. loc: cit_: p. 275. Sleep is a morsel of death\nborrowed to keep up and renew the part of life which is exhausted by\nthe day--_le sommeil est un emprunt fait \u00e0 la mort_. Or it might be\nsaid that sleep is the interest we have to pay on the capital which is\ncalled in at death; and the higher the rate of interest and the\nmore regularly it is paid, the further the date of redemption is\npostponed.]\nIt should be clearly understood that thought is nothing but the\norganic function of the brain; and it has to obey the same laws in\nregard to exertion and repose as any other organic function. The brain\ncan be ruined by overstrain, just like the eyes. As the function of\nthe stomach is to digest, so it is that of the brain to think. The\nnotion of a _soul_,--as something elementary and immaterial, merely\nlodging in the brain and needing nothing at all for the performance\nof its essential function, which consists in always and unweariedly\n_thinking_--has undoubtedly driven many people to foolish practices,\nleading to a deadening of the intellectual powers; Frederick the\nGreat, even, once tried to form the habit of doing without sleep\naltogether. It would be well if professors of philosophy refrained\nfrom giving currency to a notion which is attended by practical\nresults of a pernicious character; but then this is just what\nprofessorial philosophy does, in its old-womanish endeavor to keep on\ngood terms with the catechism. A man should accustom himself to\nview his intellectual capacities in no other light than that of\nphysiological functions, and to manage them accordingly--nursing or\nexercising them as the case may be; remembering that every kind of\nphysical suffering, malady or disorder, in whatever part of the body\nit occurs, has its effect upon the mind. The best advice that I know\non this subject is given by Cabanis in his _Rapports du physique et du\nmoral de l'homme_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. The work to which Schopenhauer\nhere refers is a series of essays by Cabanis, a French philosopher\n(1757-1808), treating of mental and moral phenomena on a physiological\nbasis. In his later days, Cabanis completely abandoned his\nmaterialistic standpoint.]\nThrough neglect of this rule, many men of genius and great scholars\nhave become weak-minded and childish, or even gone quite mad, as they\ngrew old. To take no other instances, there can be no doubt that the\ncelebrated English poets of the early part of this century, Scott,\nWordsworth, Southey, became intellectually dull and incapable towards\nthe end of their days, nay, soon after passing their sixtieth year;\nand that their imbecility can be traced to the fact that, at that\nperiod of life, they were all led on? by the promise of high pay, to\ntreat literature as a trade and to write for money. This seduced them\ninto an unnatural abuse of their intellectual powers; and a man who\nputs his Pegasus into harness, and urges on his Muse with the whip,\nwill have to pay a penalty similar to that which is exacted by the\nabuse of other kinds of power.\nAnd even in the case of Kant, I suspect that the second childhood of\nhis last four years was due to overwork in later life, and after he\nhad succeeded in becoming a famous man.\nEvery month of the year has its own peculiar and direct influence upon\nhealth and bodily condition generally; nay, even upon the state of the\nmind. It is an influence dependent upon the weather.\nCHAPTER III.\nOUR RELATION TO OTHERS.--SECTION 21.\nIn making his way through life, a man will find it useful to be ready\nand able to do two things: to look ahead and to overlook: the one\nwill protect him from loss and injury, the other from disputes and\nsquabbles.\nNo one who has to live amongst men should absolutely discard any\nperson who has his due place in the order of nature, even though he is\nvery wicked or contemptible or ridiculous. He must accept him as an\nunalterable fact--unalterable, because the necessary outcome of an\neternal, fundamental principle; and in bad cases he should\nremember the words of Mephistopheles: _es muss auch solche K\u00e4uze\ngeben[1]_--there must be fools and rogues in the world. If he acts\notherwise, he will be committing an injustice, and giving a challenge\nof life and death to the man he discards. No one can alter his\nown peculiar individuality, his moral character, his intellectual\ncapacity, his temperament or physique; and if we go so far as to\ncondemn a man from every point of view, there will be nothing left him\nbut to engage us in deadly conflict; for we are practically allowing\nhim the right to exist only on condition that he becomes another\nman--which is impossible; his nature forbids it.\n[Footnote 1: Goethe's _Faust_, Part I.]\nSo if you have to live amongst men, you must allow everyone the right\nto exist in accordance with the character he has, whatever it turns\nout to be: and all you should strive to do is to make use of this\ncharacter in such a way as its kind and nature permit, rather than to\nhope for any alteration in it, or to condemn it off-hand for what it\nis. This is the true sense of the maxim--Live and let live. That,\nhowever, is a task which is difficult in proportion as it is right;\nand he is a happy man who can once for all avoid having to do with a\ngreat many of his fellow creatures.\nThe art of putting up with people may be learned by practicing\npatience on inanimate objects, which, in virtue of some mechanical\nor general physical necessity, oppose a stubborn resistance to our\nfreedom of action--a form of patience which is required every day.\nThe patience thus gained may be applied to our dealings with men,\nby accustoming ourselves to regard their opposition, wherever we\nencounter it, as the inevitable outcome of their nature, which sets\nitself up against us in virtue of the same rigid law of necessity as\ngoverns the resistance of inanimate objects. To become indignant at\ntheir conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it\nrolls into your path. And with many people the wisest thing you can\ndo, is to resolve to make use of those whom you cannot alter.\nSECTION 22. It is astonishing how easily and how quickly similarity,\nor difference of mind and disposition, makes itself felt between one\nman and another as soon as they begin to talk: every little trifle\nshows it. When two people of totally different natures are conversing,\nalmost everything said by the one will, in a greater or less degree,\ndisplease the other, and in many cases produce positive annoyance;\neven though the conversation turn upon the most out-of-the-way\nsubject, or one in which neither of the parties has any real interest.\nPeople of similar nature, on the other hand, immediately come to feel\na kind of general agreement; and if they are cast very much in the\nsame mould, complete harmony or even unison will flow from their\nintercourse.\nThis explain two circumstances. First of all, it shows why it is that\ncommon, ordinary people are so sociable and find good company wherever\nthey go. Ah! those good, dear, brave people. It is just the contrary\nwith those who are not of the common run; and the less they are so,\nthe more unsociable they become; so that if, in their isolation, they\nchance to come across some one in whose nature they can find even\na single sympathetic chord, be it never so minute, they show\nextraordinary pleasure in his society. For one man can be to another\nonly so much as the other is to him. Great minds are like eagles, and\nbuild their nest in some lofty solitude.\nSecondly, we are enabled to understand how it is that people of like\ndisposition so quickly get on with one another, as though they were\ndrawn together by magnetic force--kindred souls greeting each other\nfrom afar. Of course the most frequent opportunity of observing this\nis afforded by people of vulgar tastes and inferior intellect, but\nonly because their name is legion; while those who are better off in\nthis respect and of a rarer nature, are not often to be met with: they\nare called rare because you can seldom find them.\nTake the case of a large number of people who have formed themselves\ninto a league for the purpose of carrying out some practical object;\nif there be two rascals among them, they will recognize each other as\nreadily as if they bore a similar badge, and will at once conspire\nfor some misfeasance or treachery. In the same way, if you can\nimagine--_per impossible_--a large company of very intelligent and\nclever people, amongst whom there are only two blockheads, these two\nwill be sure to be drawn together by a feeling of sympathy, and each\nof them will very soon secretly rejoice at having found at least one\nintelligent person in the whole company. It is really quite curious\nto see how two such men, especially if they are morally and\nintellectually of an inferior type, will recognize each other at first\nsight; with what zeal they will strive to become intimate; how affably\nand cheerily they will run to greet each other, just as though they\nwere old friends;--it is all so striking that one is tempted to\nembrace the Buddhist doctrine of metempsychosis and presume that they\nwere on familiar terms in some former state of existence.\nStill, in spite of all this general agreement, men are kept apart who\nmight come together; or, in some cases, a passing discord springs up\nbetween them. This is due to diversity of mood. You will hardly\never see two people exactly in the same frame of mind; for that is\nsomething which varies with their condition of life, occupation,\nsurroundings, health, the train of thought they are in at the moment,\nand so on. These differences give rise to discord between persons of\nthe most harmonious disposition. To correct the balance properly, so\nas to remove the disturbance--to introduce, as it were, a uniform\ntemperature,--is a work demanding a very high degree of culture. The\nextent to which uniformity of mood is productive of good-fellowship\nmay be measured by its effects upon a large company. When, for\ninstance, a great many people are gathered together and presented with\nsome objective interest which works upon all alike and influences them\nin a similar way, no matter what it be--a common danger or hope, some\ngreat news, a spectacle, a play, a piece of music, or anything of that\nkind--you will find them roused to a mutual expression of thought,\nand a display of sincere interest. There will be a general feeling\nof pleasure amongst them; for that which attracts their attention\nproduces a unity of mood by overpowering all private and personal\ninterests.\nAnd in default of some objective interest of the kind I have\nmentioned, recourse is usually had to something subjective. A bottle\nof wine is not an uncommon means of introducing a mutual feeling of\nfellowship; and even tea and coffee are used for a like end.\nThe discord which so easily finds its way into all society as an\neffect of the different moods in which people happen to be for the\nmoment, also in part explains why it is that memory always idealizes,\nand sometimes almost transfigures, the attitude we have taken up at\nany period of the past--a change due to our inability to remember all\nthe fleeting influences which disturbed us on any given occasion.\nMemory is in this respect like the lens of a _camera obscura_: it\ncontracts everything within its range, and so produces a much finer\npicture than the actual landscape affords. And, in the case of a man,\nabsence always goes some way towards securing this advantageous light;\nfor though the idealizing tendency of the memory requires times to\ncomplete its work, it begins it at once. Hence it is a prudent thing\nto see your friends and acquaintances only at considerable intervals\nof time; and on meeting them again, you will observe that memory has\nbeen at work.\nSECTION 23. No man can see _over his own height._ Let me explain what\nI mean.\nYou cannot see in another man any more than you have in yourself; and\nyour own intelligence strictly determines the extent to which he comes\nwithin its grasp. If your intelligence is of a very low order, mental\nqualities in another, even though they be of the highest kind,\nwill have no effect at all upon you; you will see nothing in their\npossessor except the meanest side of his individuality--in other\nwords, just those parts of his character and disposition which are\nweak and defective. Your whole estimate of the man will be confined to\nhis defects, and his higher mental qualities will no more exist for\nyou than colors exist for those who cannot see.\nIntellect is invisible to the man who has none. In any attempt to\ncriticise another's work, the range of knowledge possessed by the\ncritic is as essential a part of his verdict as the claims of the work\nitself.\nHence intercourse with others involves a process of leveling down. The\nqualities which are present in one man, and absent in another, cannot\ncome into play when they meet; and the self-sacrifice which this\nentails upon one of the parties, calls forth no recognition from the\nother.\nConsider how sordid, how stupid, in a word, how _vulgar_ most men\nare, and you will see that it is impossible to talk to them without\nbecoming vulgar yourself for the time being. Vulgarity is in this\nrespect like electricity; it is easily distributed. You will then\nfully appreciate the truth and propriety of the expression, _to make\nyourself cheap_; and you will be glad to avoid the society of people\nwhose only possible point of contact with you is just that part of\nyour nature of which you have least reason to be proud. So you will\nsee that, in dealing with fools and blockheads, there is only one way\nof showing your intelligence--by having nothing to do with them. That\nmeans, of course, that when you go into society, you may now and then\nfeel like a good dancer who gets an invitation to a ball, and on\narriving, finds that everyone is lame:--with whom is he to dance?\nSECTION 24. I feel respect for the man--and he is one in a\nhundred--who, when he is waiting or sitting unoccupied, refrains from\nrattling or beating time with anything that happens to be handy,--his\nstick, or knife and fork, or whatever else it may be. The probability\nis that he is thinking of something.\nWith a large number of people, it is quite evident that their power of\nsight completely dominates over their power of thought; they seem to\nbe conscious of existence only when they are making a noise; unless\nindeed they happen to be smoking, for this serves a similar end. It is\nfor the same reason that they never fail to be all eyes and ears for\nwhat is going on around them.\nSECTION 25. La Rochefoucauld makes the striking remark that it is\ndifficult to feel deep veneration and great affection for one and the\nsame person. If this is so, we shall have to choose whether it is\nveneration or love that we want from our fellow-men.\nTheir love is always selfish, though in very different ways; and the\nmeans used to gain it are not always of a kind to make us proud. A\nman is loved by others mainly in the degree in which he moderates\nhis claim on their good feeling and intelligence: but he must act\ngenuinely in the matter and without dissimulation--not merely out of\nforbearance, which is at bottom a kind of contempt. This calls to mind\na very true observation of Helvetius[1]: _the amount of intellect\nnecessary to please us, is a most accurate measure of the amount of\nintellect we have ourselves_. With these remarks as premises, it is\neasy to draw the conclusion.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. Helvetius, Claude-Adrien (1715-71),\na French philosophical writer much esteemed by Schopenhauer. His chief\nwork, _De l'Esprit_, excited great interest and opposition at the\ntime of its publication, on account of the author's pronounced\nmaterialism.]\nNow with veneration the case is just the opposite; it is wrung from\nmen reluctantly, and for that very reason mostly concealed. Hence, as\ncompared with love, veneration gives more real satisfaction; for it is\nconnected with personal value, and the same is not directly true\nof love, which is subjective in its nature, whilst veneration is\nobjective. To be sure, it is more useful to be loved than to be\nvenerated.\nSECTION 26. Most men are so thoroughly subjective that nothing really\ninterests them but themselves. They always think of their own case\nas soon as ever any remark is made, and their whole attention is\nengrossed and absorbed by the merest chance reference to anything\nwhich affects them personally, be it never so remote: with the result\nthat they have no power left for forming an objective view of things,\nshould the conversation take that turn; neither can they admit any\nvalidity in arguments which tell against their interest or their\nvanity. Hence their attention is easily distracted. They are so\nreadily offended, insulted or annoyed, that in discussing any\nimpersonal matter with them, no care is too great to avoid letting\nyour remarks bear the slightest possible reference to the very worthy\nand sensitive individuals whom you have before you; for anything you\nmay say will perhaps hurt their feelings. People really care about\nnothing that does not affect them personally. True and striking\nobservations, fine, subtle and witty things are lost upon them: they\ncannot understand or feel them. But anything that disturbs their petty\nvanity in the most remote and indirect way, or reflects prejudicially\nupon their exceedingly precious selves--to that, they are most\ntenderly sensitive. In this respect they are like the little dog whose\ntoes you are so apt to tread upon inadvertently--you know it by the\nshrill bark it sets up: or, again, they resemble a sick man covered\nwith sores and boils, with whom the greatest care must be taken to\navoid unnecessary handling. And in some people this feeling reaches\nsuch a pass that, if they are talking with anyone, and he exhibits, or\ndoes not sufficiently conceal, his intelligence and discernment, they\nlook upon it as a downright insult; although for the moment they hide\ntheir ill will, and the unsuspecting author of it afterwards ruminates\nin vain upon their conduct, and racks his brain to discover what he\ncould possibly have done to excite their malice and hatred.\nBut it is just as easy to flatter and win them over; and this is why\ntheir judgment is usually corrupt, and why their opinions are swayed,\nnot by what is really true and right, but by the favor of the party or\nclass to which they belong. And the ultimate reason of it all is, that\nin such people force of will greatly predominates over knowledge; and\nhence their meagre intellect is wholly given up to the service of the\nwill, and can never free itself from that service for a moment.\nAstrology furnishes a magnificent proof of this miserable subjective\ntendency in men, which leads them to see everything only as bearing\nupon themselves, and to think of nothing that is not straightway made\ninto a personal matter. The aim of astrology is to bring the motions\nof the celestial bodies into relation with the wretched _Ego_ and to\nestablish a connection between a comet in the sky and squabbles and\nrascalities on earth.[1]\n[Footnote 1: See, for instance, Stobasus, _Eclog. I_. xxii. 9.]\nSECTION 27. When any wrong statement is made, whether in public or\nin society, or in books, and well received--or, at any rate, not\nrefuted--that that is no reason why you should despair or think there\nthe matter will rest. You should comfort yourself with the reflection\nthat the question will be afterwards gradually subjected to\nexamination; light will be thrown upon it; it will be thought over,\nconsidered, discussed, and generally in the end the correct view will\nbe reached; so that, after a time--the length of which will depend\nupon the difficulty of the subject--everyone will come to understand\nthat which a clear head saw at once.\nIn the meantime, of course, you must have patience. He who can see\ntruly in the midst of general infatuation is like a man whose watch\nkeeps good time, when all clocks in the town in which he lives are\nwrong. He alone knows the right time; but what use is that to him?\nfor everyone goes by the clocks which speak false, not even excepting\nthose who know that his watch is the only one that is right.\nSECTION 28. Men are like children, in that, if you spoil them, they\nbecome naughty.\nTherefore it is well not to be too indulgent or charitable with\nanyone. You may take it as a general rule that you will not lose a\nfriend by refusing him a loan, but that you are very likely to do\nso by granting it; and, for similar reasons, you will not readily\nalienate people by being somewhat proud and careless in your\nbehaviour; but if you are very kind and complaisant towards them, you\nwill often make them arrogant and intolerable, and so a breach will\nensue.\nThere is one thing that, more than any other, throws people absolutely\noff their balance--the thought that you are dependent upon them. This\nis sure to produce an insolent and domineering manner towards you.\nThere are some people, indeed, who become rude if you enter into any\nkind of relation with them; for instance, if you have occasion to\nconverse with them frequently upon confidential matters, they soon\ncome to fancy that they can take liberties with you, and so they try\nand transgress the laws of politeness. This is why there are so few\nwith whom you care to become more intimate, and why you should avoid\nfamiliarity with vulgar people. If a man comes to think that I am more\ndependent upon him than he is upon me, he at once feels as though I\nhad stolen something from him; and his endeavor will be to have his\nvengeance and get it back. The only way to attain superiority in\ndealing with men, is to let it be seen that you are independent of\nthem.\nAnd in this view it is advisable to let everyone of your\nacquaintance--whether man or woman--feel now and then that you\ncould very well dispense with their company. This will consolidate\nfriendship. Nay, with most people there will be no harm in\noccasionally mixing a grain of disdain with your treatment of them;\nthat will make them value your friendship all the more. _Chi non\nistima vien stimato_, as a subtle Italian proverb has it--to disregard\nis to win regard. But if we really think very highly of a person, we\nshould conceal it from him like a crime. This is not a very gratifying\nthing to do, but it is right. Why, a dog will not bear being treated\ntoo kindly, let alone a man!\nSECTION 29. It is often the case that people of noble character and\ngreat mental gifts betray a strange lack of worldly wisdom and a\ndeficiency in the knowledge of men, more especially when they are\nyoung; with the result that it is easy to deceive or mislead them; and\nthat, on the other hand, natures of the commoner sort are more ready\nand successful in making their way in the world.\nThe reason of this is that, when a man has little or no experience,\nhe must judge by his own antecedent notions; and in matters demanding\njudgment, an antecedent notion is never on the same level as\nexperience. For, with the commoner sort of people, an antecedent\nnotion means just their own selfish point of view. This is not the\ncase with those whose mind and character are above the ordinary; for\nit is precisely in this respect--their unselfishness--that they differ\nfrom the rest of mankind; and as they judge other people's thoughts\nand actions by their own high standard, the result does not always\ntally with their calculation.\nBut if, in the end, a man of noble character comes to see, as the\neffect of his own experience, or by the lessons he learns from others,\nwhat it is that may be expected of men in general,--namely, that\nfive-sixths of them are morally and intellectually so constituted\nthat, if circumstances do not place you in relation with them, you had\nbetter get out of their way and keep as far as possible from having\nanything to do with them,--still, he will scarcely ever attain an\nadequate notion of their wretchedly mean and shabby nature: all his\nlife long he will have to be extending and adding to the inferior\nestimate he forms of them; and in the meantime he will commit a great\nmany mistakes and do himself harm.\nThen, again, after he has really taken to heart the lessons that have\nbeen taught him, it will occasionally happen that, when he is in the\nsociety of people whom he does not know, he will be surprised to\nfind how thoroughly reasonable they all appear to be, both in their\nconversation and in their demeanor--in fact, quite honest, sincere,\nvirtuous and trustworthy people, and at the same time shrewd and\nclever.\nBut that ought not to perplex him. Nature is not like those bad\npoets, who, in setting a fool or a knave before us, do their work so\nclumsily, and with such evident design, that you might almost\nfancy you saw the poet standing behind each of his characters, and\ncontinually disavowing their sentiments, and telling you in a tone of\nwarning: _This is a knave; that is a fool; do not mind what he says_.\nBut Nature goes to work like Shakespeare and Goethe, poets who\nmake every one of their characters--even if it is the devil\nhimself!--appear to be quite in the right for the moment that they\ncome before us in their several parts; the characters are described so\nobjectively that they excite our interest and compel us to sympathize\nwith their point of view; for, like the works of Nature, every one\nof these characters is evolved as the result of some hidden law\nor principle, which makes all they say and do appear natural and\ntherefore necessary. And you will always be the prey or the plaything\nof the devils and fools in this world, if you expect to see them going\nabout with horns or jangling their bells.\nAnd it should be borne in mind that, in their intercourse with others,\npeople are like the moon, or like hunchbacks; they show you only one\nof their sides. Every man has an innate talent for mimicry,--for\nmaking a mask out of his physiognomy, so that he can always look as\nif he really were what he pretends to be; and since he makes his\ncalculations always within the lines of his individual nature, the\nappearance he puts on suits him to a nicety, and its effect is\nextremely deceptive. He dons his mask whenever his object is to\nflatter himself into some one's good opinion; and you may pay just as\nmuch attention to it as if it were made of wax or cardboard, never\nforgetting that excellent Italian proverb: _non \u00e9 si tristo cane che\nnon meni la coda_,--there is no dog so bad but that he will wag his\ntail.\nIn any case it is well to take care not to form a highly favorable\nopinion of a person whose acquaintance you have only recently made,\nfor otherwise you are very likely to be disappointed; and then you\nwill be ashamed of yourself and perhaps even suffer some injury.\nAnd while I am on the subject, there is another fact that deserves\nmention. It is this. A man shows his character just in the way in\nwhich he deals with trifles,--for then he is off his guard. This will\noften afford a good opportunity of observing the boundless egoism of\nman's nature, and his total lack of consideration for others; and\nif these defects show themselves in small things, or merely in his\ngeneral demeanor, you will find that they also underlie his action in\nmatters of importance, although he may disguise the fact. This is an\nopportunity which should not be missed. If in the little affairs of\nevery day,--the trifles of life, those matters to which the rule _de\nminimis non_ applies,--a man is inconsiderate and seeks only what is\nadvantageous or convenient to himself, to the prejudice of others'\nrights; if he appropriates to himself that which belongs to all alike,\nyou may be sure there is no justice in his heart, and that he would be\na scoundrel on a wholesale scale, only that law and compulsion bind\nhis hands. Do not trust him beyond your door. He who is not afraid\nto break the laws of his own private circle, will break those of the\nState when he can do so with impunity.\nIf the average man were so constituted that the good in him outweighed\nthe bad, it would be more advisable to rely upon his sense of justice,\nfairness, gratitude, fidelity, love or compassion, than to work upon\nhis fears; but as the contrary is the case, and it is the bad that\noutweighs the good, the opposite course is the more prudent one.\nIf any person with whom we are associated or have to do, exhibits\nunpleasant or annoying qualities, we have only to ask ourselves\nwhether or not this person is of so much value to us that we can put\nup with frequent and repeated exhibitions of the same qualities in a\nsomewhat aggravated form.[1] In case of an affirmative answer to this\nquestion, there will not be much to be said, because talking is very\nlittle use. We must let the matter pass, with or without some notice;\nbut we should nevertheless remember that we are thereby exposing\nourselves to a repetition of the offence. If the answer is in the\nnegative, we must break with our worthy friend at once and forever; or\nin the case of a servant, dismiss him. For he will inevitably repeat\nthe offence, or do something tantamount to it, should the occasion\nreturn, even though for the moment he is deep and sincere in his\nassurances of the contrary. There is nothing, absolutely nothing,\nthat a man cannot forget,--but not _himself, his own character_. For\ncharacter is incorrigible; because all a man's actions emanate from an\ninward principle, in virtue of which he must always do the same thing\nunder like circumstances; and he cannot do otherwise. Let me refer to\nmy prize essay on the so-called _Freedom of the Will_, the perusal\nof which will dissipate any delusions the reader may have on this\nsubject.\n[Footnote 1: To _forgive and forget_ means to throw away dearly bought\nexperience.]\nTo become reconciled to a friend with whom you have broken, is a form\nof weakness; and you pay the penalty of it when he takes the first\nopportunity of doing precisely the very thing which brought about\nthe breach; nay, he does it the more boldly, because he is secretly\nconscious that you cannot get on without him. This is also applicable\nto servants whom you have dismissed, and then taken into your service\nagain.\nFor the same reason, you should just as little expect people to\ncontinue to act in a similar way under altered circumstances. The\ntruth is that men alter their demeanor and sentiments just as fast as\ntheir interest changes; and their resign in this respect is a bill\ndrawn for short payment that the man must be still more short-sighted\nwho accepts the bill without protesting it. Accordingly, suppose you\nwant to know how a man will behave in an office into which you think\nof putting him; you should not build upon expectations, on his\npromises or assurances. For, even allowing that he is quite sincere,\nhe is speaking about a matter of which he has no knowledge. The only\nway to calculate how he will behave, is to consider the circumstances\nin which he will be placed, and the extent to which they will conflict\nwith his character.\nIf you wish to get a clear and profound insight--and it is very\nneedful--into the true but melancholy elements of which most men are\nmade, you will find in a very instructive thing to take the way they\nbehave in the pages of literature as a commentary to their doings in\npractical life, and _vice versa._ The experience thus gained will be\nvery useful in avoiding wrong ideas, whether about yourself or about\nothers. But if you come across any special trait of meanness or\nstupidity--in life or in literature,--you must be careful not to let\nit annoy or distress you, but to look upon it merely as an addition to\nyour knowledge--a new fact to be considered in studying the character\nof humanity. Your attitude towards it will be that of the mineralogist\nwho stumbles upon a very characteristic specimen of a mineral.\nOf course there are some facts which are very exceptional, and it is\ndifficult to understand how they arise, and how it is that there come\nto be such enormous differences between man and man; but, in general,\nwhat was said long ago is quite true, and the world is in a very bad\nway. In savage countries they eat one another, in civilized they\ndeceive one another; and that is what people call the way of the\nworld! What are States and all the elaborate systems of political\nmachinery, and the rule of force, whether in home or in foreign\naffairs,--what are they but barriers against the boundless iniquity\nof mankind? Does not all history show that whenever a king is firmly\nplanted on a throne, and his people reach some degree of prosperity,\nhe uses it to lead his army, like a band of robbers, against adjoining\ncountries? Are not almost all wars ultimately undertaken for purposes\nof plunder? In the most remote antiquity, and to some extent also in\nthe Middle Ages, the conquered became slaves,--in other words, they\nhad to work for those who conquered them; and where is the difference\nbetween that and paying war-taxes, which represent the product of our\nprevious work?\nAll war, says Voltaire, is a matter of robbery; and the Germans should\ntake that as a warning.\nSECTION 30. No man is so formed that he can be left entirely to\nhimself, to go his own ways; everyone needs to be guided by a\npreconceived plan, and to follow certain general rules. But if this is\ncarried too far, and a man tries to take on a character which is not\nnatural or innate in him, but it artificially acquired and evolved\nmerely by a process of reasoning, he will very soon discover that\nNature cannot be forced, and that if you drive it out, it will return\ndespite your efforts:--\n_Naturam expelles furca, tamen usque recurret_.\nTo understand a rule governing conduct towards others, even to\ndiscover it for oneself and to express it neatly, is easy enough; and\nstill, very soon afterwards, the rule may be broken in practice. But\nthat is no reason for despair; and you need not fancy that as it is\nimpossible to regulate your life in accordance with abstract ideas\nand maxims, it is better to live just as you please. Here, as in all\ntheoretical instruction that aims at a practical result, the first\nthing to do is to understand the rule; the second thing is to learn\nthe practice of it. The theory may be understand at once by an effort\nof reason, and yet the practice of it acquired only in course of time.\nA pupil may lean the various notes on an instrument of music, or the\ndifferent position in fencing; and when he makes a mistake, as he\nis sure to do, however hard he tries, he is apt to think it will be\nimpossible to observe the rules, when he is set to read music at sight\nor challenged to a furious duel. But for all that, gradual practice\nmakes him perfect, through a long series of slips, blunders and fresh\nefforts. It is just the same in other things; in learning to write and\nspeak Latin, a man will forget the grammatical rules; it is only\nby long practice that a blockhead turns into a courtier, that a\npassionate man becomes shrewd and worldly-wise, or a frank person\nreserved, or a noble person ironical. But though self-discipline of\nthis kind is the result of long habit, it always works by a sort of\nexternal compulsion, which Nature never ceases to resist and sometimes\nunexpectedly overcomes. The difference between action in accordance\nwith abstract principles, and action as the result of original,\ninnate tendency, is the same as that between a work of art, say a\nwatch--where form and movement are impressed upon shapeless and inert\nmatter--and a living organism, where form and matter are one, and each\nis inseparable from the other.\nThere is a maxim attributed to the Emperor Napoleon, which expresses\nthis relation between acquired and innate character, and confirms what\nI have said: _everything that is unnatural is imperfect_;--a rule of\nuniversal application, whether in the physical or in the moral sphere.\nThe only exception I can think of to this rule is aventurine,[1] a\nsubstance known to mineralogists, which in its natural state cannot\ncompare with the artificial preparation of it.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_. Aventurine is a rare kind of quartz;\nand the same name is given to a brownish-colored glass much resembling\nit, which is manufactured at Murano. It is so called from the fact\nthat the glass was discovered by chance _(arventura)_.]\nAnd in this connection let me utter a word of protest against any and\nevery form of _affectation_. It always arouses contempt; in the first\nplace, because it argues deception, and the deception is cowardly,\nfor it is based on fear; and, secondly, it argues self-condemnation,\nbecause it means that a man is trying to appear what he is not, and\ntherefore something which he things better than he actually is. To\naffect a quality, and to plume yourself upon it, is just to confess\nthat you have not got it. Whether it is courage, or learning, or\nintellect, or wit, or success with women, or riches, or social\nposition, or whatever else it may be that a man boasts of, you may\nconclude by his boasting about it that that is precisely the direction\nin which he is rather weak; for if a man really possesses any faculty\nto the full, it will not occur to him to make a great show of\naffecting it; he is quite content to know that he has it. That is the\napplication of the Spanish proverb: _herradura que chacolotea clavo le\nfalta_--a clattering hoof means a nail gone. To be sure, as I said at\nfirst, no man ought to let the reins go quite loose, and show himself\njust as he is; for there are many evil and bestial sides to our nature\nwhich require to be hidden away out of sight; and this justifies the\nnegative attitude of dissimulation, but it does not justify a\npositive feigning of qualities which are not there. It should also be\nremembered that affectation is recognized at once, even before it is\nclear what it is that is being affected. And, finally, affectation\ncannot last very long, and one day the mask will fall off. _Nemo\npotest personam diu ferre fictam_, says Seneca;[1] _ficta cito in\nnaturam suam recidunt_--no one can persevere long in a fictitious\ncharacter; for nature will soon reassert itself.\n[Footnote 1: _De Clementia, I_. 1.]\nSECTION 31. A man bears the weight of his own body without knowing it,\nbut he soon feels the weight of any other, if he tries to move it; in\nthe same way, a man can see other people's shortcoming's and vices,\nbut he is blind to his own. This arrangement has one advantage: it\nturns other people into a kind of mirror, in which a man can see\nclearly everything that is vicious, faulty, ill-bred and loathsome in\nhis own nature; only, it is generally the old story of the dog barking\nat is own image; it is himself that he sees and not another dog, as he\nfancies.\nHe who criticises others, works at the reformation of himself. Those\nwho form the secret habit of scrutinizing other people's general\nbehavior, and passing severe judgment upon what they do and leave\nundone, thereby improve themselves, and work out their own perfection:\nfor they will have sufficient sense of justice, or at any rate enough\npride and vanity, to avoid in their own case that which they condemn\nso harshly elsewhere. But tolerant people are just the opposite,\nand claim for themselves the same indulgence that they extend to\nothers--_hanc veniam damus petimusque vicissim_. It is all very well\nfor the Bible to talk about the mote in another's eye and the beam in\none's own. The nature of the eye is to look not at itself but at other\nthings; and therefore to observe and blame faults in another is a\nvery suitable way of becoming conscious of one's own. We require a\nlooking-glass for the due dressing of our morals.\nThe same rule applies in the case of style and fine writing. If,\ninstead of condemning, you applaud some new folly in these matters,\nyou will imitate it. That is just why literary follies have such vogue\nin Germany. The Germans are a very tolerant people--everybody can see\nthat! Their maxim is--_Hanc veniam damns petimusque vicissim._\nSECTION 32. When he is young, a man of noble character fancies that\nthe relations prevailing amongst mankind, and the alliances to which\nthese relations lead, are at bottom and essentially, _ideal_ in their\nnature; that is to say, that they rest upon similarity of disposition\nor sentiment, or taste, or intellectual power, and so on.\nBut, later on, he finds out that it is a _real_ foundation which\nunderlies these alliances; that they are based upon some _material_\ninterest. This is the true foundation of almost all alliances: nay,\nmost men have no notion of an alliance resting upon any other basis.\nAccordingly we find that a man is always measured by the office he\nholds, or by his occupation, nationality, or family relations--in a\nword, by the position and character which have been assigned him\nin the conventional arrangements of life, where he is ticketed and\ntreated as so much goods. Reference to what he is in himself, as a\nman--to the measure of his own personal qualities--is never made\nunless for convenience' sake: and so that view of a man is something\nexceptional, to be set aside and ignored, the moment that anyone finds\nit disagreeable; and this is what usually happens. But the more of\npersonal worth a man has, the less pleasure he will take in these\nconventional arrangements; and he will try to withdraw from the sphere\nin which they apply. The reason why these arrangements exist at all,\nis simply that in this world of ours misery and need are the chief\nfeatures: therefore it is everywhere the essential and paramount\nbusiness of life to devise the means of alleviating them.\nSECTION 33. As paper-money circulates in the world instead of real\ncoin, so, is the place of true esteem and genuine friendship, you have\nthe outward appearance of it--a mimic show made to look as much like\nthe real thing as possible.\nOn the other hand, it may be asked whether there are any people who\nreally deserve the true coin. For my own part, I should certainly pay\nmore respect to an honest dog wagging his tail than to a hundred such\ndemonstrations of human regard.\nTrue and genuine friendship presupposes a strong sympathy with the\nweal and woe of another--purely objective in its character and quite\ndisinterested; and this in its turn means an absolute identification\nof self with the object of friendship. The egoism of human nature is\nso strongly antagonistic to any such sympathy, that true friendship\nbelongs to that class of things--the sea-serpent, for instance,--with\nregard to which no one knows whether they are fabulous or really exist\nsomewhere or other.\nStill, in many cases, there is a grain of true and genuine friendship\nin the relation of man to man, though generally, of course, some\nsecret personal interest is at the bottom of them--some one among the\nmany forms that selfishness can take. But in a world where all is\nimperfect, this grain of true feeling is such an ennobling influence\nthat it gives some warrant for calling those relations by the name of\nfriendship, for they stand far above the ordinary friendships that\nprevail amongst mankind. The latter are so constituted that, were you\nto hear how your dear friends speak of you behind your back, you would\nnever say another word to them.\nApart from the case where it would be a real help to you if your\nfriend were to make some great sacrifice to serve you, there is no\nbetter means of testing the genuineness of his feelings than the way\nin which he receives the news of a misfortune that has just happened\nto you. At that moment the expression of his features will either show\nthat his one thought is that of true and sincere sympathy for you; or\nelse the absolute composure of his countenance, or the passing trace\nof something other than sympathy, will confirm the well-known maxim\nof La Rochefoucauld: _Dans l'adversite de nos meilleurs amis, nous\ntrouvons toujours quelque chose qui ne nous deplait pas_. Indeed, at\nsuch a moment, the ordinary so-called friend will find it hard to\nsuppress the signs of a slight smile of pleasure. There are few ways\nby which you can make more certain of putting people into a good humor\nthan by telling them of some trouble that has recently befallen you,\nor by unreservedly disclosing some personal weakness of yours. How\ncharacteristic this is of humanity!\nDistance and long absence are always prejudicial to friendship,\nhowever disinclined a man may be to admit. Our regard for people whom\nwe do not see--even though they be our dearest friends--gradually\ndries up in the course of years, and they become abstract notions;\nso that our interest in them grows to be more and more\nintellectual,--nay, it is kept up only as a kind of tradition; whilst\nwe retain a lively and deep interest in those who are constantly\nbefore our eyes, even if they be only pet animals. This shows how\nmuch men are limited by their senses, and how true is the remark that\nGoethe makes in _Tasso_ about the dominant influence of the present\nmoment:--\n_Die Gegenwart ist eine m\u00e4chtige G\u00f6ttin_[1]\n[Footnote 1: Act iv., se. 4.]\n_Friends of the house_ are very rightly so called; because they are\nfriends of the house rather than of its master; in other words, they\nare more like cats than dogs.\nYour friends will tell you that they are sincere; your enemies are\nreally so. Let your enemies' censure be like a bitter medicine, to be\nused as a means of self-knowledge.\nA friend in need, as the saying goes, is rare. Nay, it is just the\ncontrary; no sooner have you made a friend than he is in need, and\nasks for a loan.\nSECTION 34. A man must be still a greenhorn in the ways of the\nworld, if he imagines that he can make himself popular in society by\nexhibiting intelligence and discernment. With the immense majority\nof people, such qualities excite hatred and resentment, which are\nrendered all the harder to bear by the fact that people are obliged to\nsuppress--even from themselves--the real reason of their anger.\nWhat actually takes place is this. A man feels and perceives that the\nperson with whom he is conversing is intellectually very much his\nsuperior.[1]\n[Footnote 1: Cf. _Welt als Wills und Vorstellung_, Bk. II. p. 256 (4th\nEdit.), where I quote from Dr. Johnson, and from Merck, the friend\nof Goethe's youth. The former says: _There is nothing by which a man\nexasperates most people more, than by displaying a superior ability of\nbrilliancy in conversation. They seem pleased at the time, but their\nenvy makes them curse him at their hearts._ (Boswells _Life of\nJohnson_ aetat: 74).]\nHe thereupon secretly and half unconsciously concludes that his\ninterlocutor must form a proportionately low and limited estimate of\nhis abilities. That is a method of reasoning--an enthymeme--which\nrouses the bitterest feelings of sullen and rancorous hatred. And so\nGracian is quite right in saying that the only way to win affection\nfrom people is to show the most animal-like simplicity of\ndemeanor--_para ser bien quisto, el unico medio vestirse la piel del\nmas simple de los brutos_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Balthazar Graeian, _Oraculo manual,\ny arte de prudencia_, 240. Gracian (1584-1658) was a Spanish prose\nwriter and Jesuit, whose works deal chiefly with the observation\nof character in the various phenomena of life. Schopenhauer, among\nothers, had a great admiration for his worldly philosophy, and\ntranslated his _Oraculo manual_--a system of rules for the conduct of\nlife--into German. The same book was translated into English towards\nthe close of the seventeenth century.]\nTo show your intelligence and discernment is only an indirect way of\nreproaching other people for being dull and incapable. And besides, it\nis natural for a vulgar man to be violently agitated by the sight of\nopposition in any form; and in this case envy comes in as the secret\ncause of his hostility. For it is a matter of daily observation that\npeople take the greatest pleasure in that which satisfies their\nvanity; and vanity cannot be satisfied without comparison with others.\nNow, there is nothing of which a man is prouder than of intellectual\nability, for it is this that gives him his commanding place in the\nanimal world. It is an exceedingly rash thing to let any one see that\nyou are decidedly superior to him in this respect, and to let other\npeople see it too; because he will then thirst for vengeance, and\ngenerally look about for an opportunity of taking it by means of\ninsult, because this is to pass from the sphere of _intellect_ to\nthat of _will_--and there, all are on an equal footing as regards the\nfeeling of hostility. Hence, while rank and riches may always reckon\nupon deferential treatment in society, that is something which\nintellectual ability can never expect; to be ignored is the greatest\nfavor shown to it; and if people notice it at all, it is because they\nregard it as a piece of impertinence, or else as something to which\nits possessor has no legitimate right, and upon which he dares to\npride himself; and in retaliation and revenge for his conduct, people\nsecretly try and humiliate him in some other way; and if they wait to\ndo this, it is only for a fitting opportunity. A man may be as humble\nas possible in his demeanor, and yet hardly ever get people to\noverlook his crime in standing intellectually above them. In the\n_Garden of Roses_, Sadi makes the remark:--_You should know that\nfoolish people are a hundredfold more averse to meeting the wise than\nthe wise are indisposed for the company of the foolish_.\nOn the other hand, it is a real recommendation to be stupid. For just\nas warmth is agreeable to the body, so it does the mind good to feel\nits superiority; and a man will seek company likely to give him this\nfeeling, as instinctively as he will approach the fireplace or walk\nin the sun if he wants to get warm. But this means that he will be\ndisliked on account of his superiority; and if a man is to be liked,\nhe must really be inferior in point of intellect; and the same thing\nholds good of a woman in point of beauty. To give proof of real and\nunfeigned inferiority to some of the people you meet--that is a very\ndifficult business indeed!\nConsider how kindly and heartily a girl who is passably pretty will\nwelcome one who is downright ugly. Physical advantages are not thought\nso much of in the case of man, though I suppose you would rather a\nlittle man sat next to you than one who was bigger than yourself. This\nis why, amongst men, it is the dull and ignorant, and amongst women,\nthe ugly, who are always popular and in request.[1] It is likely to\nbe said of such people that they are extremely good-natured, because\nevery one wants to find a pretext for caring about them--a pretext\nwhich will blind both himself and other people to the real reason why\nhe likes them. This is also why mental superiority of any sort always\ntends to isolate its possessor; people run away from him out of\npure hatred, and say all manner of bad things about him by way of\njustifying their action. Beauty, in the case of women, has a similar\neffect: very pretty girls have no friends of their own sex, and they\neven find it hard to get another girl to keep them company. A handsome\nwoman should always avoid applying for a position as companion,\nbecause the moment she enters the room, her prospective mistress will\nscowl at her beauty, as a piece of folly with which, both for her own\nand for her daughter's sake, she can very well dispense. But if the\ngirl has advantages of rank, the case is very different; because rank,\nunlike personal qualities which work by the force of mere contrast,\nproduces its effect by a process of reflection; much in the same\nway as the particular hue of a person's complexion depends upon the\nprevailing tone of his immediate surroundings.\n[Footnote 1: If you desire to get on in the world, friends and\nacquaintances are by far the best passport to fortune. The possession\nof a great deal of ability makes a man proud, and therefore not apt to\nflatter those who have very little, and from whom, on that account,\nthe possession of great ability should be carefully concealed. The\nconsciousness of small intellectual power has just the opposite\neffect, and is very compatible with a humble, affable and\ncompanionable nature, and with respect for what is mean and wretched.\nThis is why an inferior sort of man has so many friends to befriend\nand encourage him.\nThese remarks are applicable not only to advancement in political\nlife, but to all competition for places of honor and dignity, nay,\neven for reputation in the world of science, literature and art. In\nlearned societies, for example, mediocrity--that very acceptable\nquality--is always to the fore, whilst merit meets with tardy\nrecognition, or with none at all. So it is in everything.]\nSECTION 35. Our trust in other people often consists in great measure\nof pure laziness, selfishness and vanity on our own part: I say\n_laziness_, because, instead of making inquiries ourselves, and\nexercising an active care, we prefer to trust others; _selfishness_,\nbecause we are led to confide in people by the pressure of our own\naffairs; and _vanity_, when we ask confidence for a matter on which we\nrather pride ourselves. And yet, for all that, we expect people to be\ntrue to the trust we repose in them.\nBut we ought not to become angry if people put no trust in us: because\nthat really means that they pay honesty the sincere compliment of\nregarding it as a very rare thing,--so rare, indeed, as to leave us in\ndoubt whether its existence is not merely fabulous.\nSECTION 36. _Politeness_,--which the Chinese hold to be a cardinal\nvirtue,--is based upon two considerations of policy. I have explained\none of these considerations in my _Ethics_; the other is as\nfollows:--Politeness is a tacit agreement that people's miserable\ndefects, whether moral or intellectual, shall on either side be\nignored and not made the subject of reproach; and since these defects\nare thus rendered somewhat less obtrusive, the result is mutually\nadvantageous.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--In the passage referred to\n_(Grundlage der Moral_, collected works, Vol. IV., pp. 187 and 198),\nSchopenhauer explains politeness as a conventional and systematic\nattempt to mask the egoism of human nature in the small affairs of\nlife,--an egoism so repulsive that some such device is necessary for\nthe purpose of concealing its ugliness. The relation which politeness\nbears to the true love of one's neighbor is analogous to that existing\nbetween justice as an affair of legality, and justice as the real\nintegrity of the heart.]\nIt is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing\nto be rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and willful incivility,\nis just as insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For\npoliteness is like a counter--an avowedly false coin, with which it is\nfoolish to be stingy. A sensible man will be generous in the use\nof it. It is customary in every country to end a letter with\nthe words:--_your most obedient servant_--_votre tr\u00e8s-humble\nserviteur_--_suo devotissimo servo_. (The Germans are the only people\nwho suppress the word _servant_--_Diener_--because, of course, it is\nnot true!) However, to carry politeness to such an extent as to damage\nyour prospects, is like giving money where only counters are expected.\nWax, a substance naturally hard and brittle, can be made soft by the\napplication of a little warmth, so that it will take any shape you\nplease. In the same way, by being polite and friendly, you can make\npeople pliable and obliging, even though they are apt to be crabbed\nand malevolent. Hence politeness is to human nature what warmth is to\nwax.\nOf course, it is no easy matter to be polite; in so far, I mean, as it\nrequires us to show great respect for everybody, whereas most people\ndeserve none at all; and again in so far as it demands that we should\nfeign the most lively interest in people, when we must be very glad\nthat we have nothing to do with them. To combine politeness with pride\nis a masterpiece of wisdom.\nWe should be much less ready to lose our temper over an\ninsult,--which, in the strict sense of the word, means that we have\nnot been treated with respect,--if, on the one hand, we have not such\nan exaggerated estimate of our value and dignity--that is to say, if\nwe were not so immensely proud of ourselves; and, on the other hand,\nif we had arrived at any clear notion of the judgment which, in his\nheart, one man generally passes upon another. If most people resent\nthe slightest hint that any blame attaches to them, you may imagine\ntheir feelings if they were to overhear what their acquaintance say\nabout them. You should never lose sight of the fact that ordinary\npoliteness is only a grinning mask: if it shifts its place a little,\nor is removed for a moment, there is no use raising a hue and cry.\nWhen a man is downright rude, it is as though he had taken off all his\nclothes, and stood before you in _puris naturalibus_. Like most men in\nthis condition, he does not present a very attractive appearance.\nSECTION 37. You ought never to take any man as a model for what you\nshould do or leave undone; because position and circumstances are in\nno two cases alike, and difference of character gives a peculiar,\nindividual tone to what a man does. Hence _duo cum faciunt idem, non\nest idem_--two persons may do the same thing with a different result.\nA man should act in accordance with his own character, as soon as he\nhas carefully deliberated on what he is about to do.\nThe outcome of this is that _originality_ cannot be dispensed with in\npractical matters: otherwise, what a man does will not accord with\nwhat he is.\nSECTION 38. Never combat any man's opinion; for though you reached the\nage of Methuselah, you would never have done setting him right upon\nall the absurd things that he believes.\nIt is also well to avoid correcting people's mistakes in conversation,\nhowever good your intentions may be; for it is easy to offend people,\nand difficult, if not impossible, to mend them.\nIf you feel irritated by the absurd remarks of two people whose\nconversation you happen to overhear, you should imagine that you are\nlistening to a dialogue of two fools in a comedy. _Probatum est._\nThe man who comes into the world with the notion that he is really\ngoing to instruct in matters of the highest importance, may thank his\nstars if he escapes with a whole skin.\nSECTION 39. If you want your judgment to be accepted, express it\ncoolly and without passion. All violence has its seat in the _will_;\nand so, if your judgment is expressed with vehemence, people will\nconsider it an effort of will, and not the outcome of knowledge, which\nis in its nature cold and unimpassioned. Since the will is the primary\nand radical element in human nature, and _intellect_ merely supervenes\nas something secondary, people are more likely to believe that the\nopinion you express with so much vehemence is due to the excited state\nof your will, rather than that the excitement of the will comes only\nfrom the ardent nature of your opinion.\nSECTION 40. Even when you are fully justified in praising yourself,\nyou should never be seduced into doing so. For vanity is so very\ncommon, and merit so very uncommon, that even if a man appears to be\npraising himself, though very indirectly, people will be ready to lay\na hundred to one that he is talking out of pure vanity, and that he\nhas not sense enough to see what a fool he is making of himself.\nStill, for all that, there may be some truth in Bacon's remark that,\nas in the case of calumny, if you throw enough dirt, some of it will\nstick, so it it also in regard to self-praise; with the conclusion\nthat self-praise, in small doses, is to be recommended.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Schopenhauer alludes to the\nfollowing passage in Bacon's _De Augmentis Scientiarum_, Bk. viii.,\nch. 2: _Sicut enim dici solet de calumnia_, audacter calumniare,\nsemper aliquid haeret; _sic dici potest de jactantia, (nisi plane\ndeformis fuerit et ridicula_), audacter te vendita, semper aliquid\nhaeret. _Haerebit certe apud populum, licet prudentiores subrideant.\nItaque existimatio parta apud plurimos paucorum fastidium abunde\ncompensabit._]\nSECTION 41. If you have reason to suspect that a person is telling you\na lie, look as though you believed every word he said. This will give\nhim courage to go on; he will become more vehement in his assertions,\nand in the end betray himself.\nAgain, if you perceive that a person is trying to conceal something\nfrom you, but with only partial success, look as though you did not\nbelieve him, This opposition on your part will provoke him into\nleading out his reserve of truth and bringing the whole force of it to\nbear upon your incredulity.\nSECTION 42. You should regard all your private affairs as secrets,\nand, in respect of them, treat your acquaintances, even though you\nare on good terms with them, as perfect strangers, letting them know\nnothing more than they can see for themselves. For in course of time,\nand under altered circumstances, you may find it a disadvantage that\nthey know even the most harmless things about you.\nAnd, as a general rule, it is more advisable to show your intelligence\nby saying nothing than by speaking out; for silence is a matter\nof prudence, whilst speech has something in it of vanity. The\nopportunities for displaying the one or the other quality occur\nequally often; but the fleeting satisfaction afforded by speech is\noften preferred to the permanent advantage secured by silence.\nThe feeling of relief which lively people experience in speaking aloud\nwhen no one is listening, should not be indulged, lest it grow into a\nhabit; for in this way thought establishes such very friendly terms\nwith speech, that conversation is apt to become a process of thinking\naloud. Prudence exacts that a wide gulf should be fixed between what\nwe think and what we say.\nAt times we fancy that people are utterly unable to believe in the\ntruth of some statement affecting us personally, whereas it never\noccurs to them to doubt it; but if we give them the slightest\nopportunity of doubting it, they find it absolutely impossible\nto believe it any more. We often betray ourselves into revealing\nsomething, simply because we suppose that people cannot help noticing\nit,--just as a man will throw himself down from a great height because\nhe loses his head, in other words, because he fancies that he cannot\nretain a firm footing any longer; the torment of his position is so\ngreat, that he thinks it better to put an end to it at once. This is\nthe kind of insanity which is called _acrophobia_.\nBut it should not be forgotten how clever people are in regard\nto affairs which do not concern them, even though they show no\nparticularly sign of acuteness in other matters. This is a kind of\nalgebra in which people are very proficient: give them a single fact\nto go upon, and they will solve the most complicated problems. So,\nif you wish to relate some event that happened long ago, without\nmentioning any names, or otherwise indicating the persons to whom you\nrefer, you should be very careful not to introduce into your narrative\nanything that might point, however distantly, to some definite fact,\nwhether it is a particular locality, or a date, or the name of some\none who was only to a small extent implicated, or anything else that\nwas even remotely connected with the event; for that at once gives\npeople something positive to go upon, and by the aid of their talent\nfor this sort of algebra, they will discover all the rest. Their\ncuriosity in these matters becomes a kind of enthusiasm: their will\nspurs on their intellect, and drives it forward to the attainment\nof the most remote results. For however unsusceptible and different\npeople may be to general and universal truths, they are very ardent in\nthe matter of particular details.\nIn keeping with what I have said, it will be found that all those\nwho profess to give instructions in the wisdom of life are specially\nurgent in commending the practice of silence, and assign manifold\nreasons why it should be observed; so it is not necessary for me to\nenlarge upon the subject any further. However, I may just add one or\ntwo little known Arabian proverbs, which occur to me as peculiarly\nappropriate:--\n_Do not tell a friend anything that you would conceal from an enemy_.\n_A secret is in my custody, if I keep it; but should it escape me, it\nis I who am the prisoner_.\n_The tree of silence bears the fruit of peace_.\nSECTION 43. Money is never spent to so much advantage as when you have\nbeen cheated out of it; for at one stroke you have purchased prudence.\nSECTION 44. If possible, no animosity should be felt for anyone. But\ncarefully observe and remember the manner in which a man conducts\nhimself, so that you may take the measure of his value,--at any\nrate in regard to yourself,--and regulate your bearing towards\nhim accordingly; never losing sight of the fact that character\nis unalterable, and that to forget the bad features in a man's\ndisposition is like throwing away hard-won money. Thus you will\nprotect yourself against the results of unwise intimacy and foolish\nfriendship.\n_Give way neither to love nor to hate_, is one-half of worldly wisdom:\n_say nothing and believe nothing_, the other half. Truly, a world\nwhere there is need of such rules as this and the following, is one\nupon which a man may well turn his back.\nSECTION 45. To speak angrily to a person, to show your hatred by\nwhat you say or by the way you look, is an unnecessary\nproceeding--dangerous, foolish, ridiculous, and vulgar.\nAnger and hatred should never be shown otherwise than in what you do;\nand feelings will be all the more effective in action, in so far\nas you avoid the exhibition of them in any other way. It is only\ncold-blooded animals whose bite is poisonous.\nSECTION 46. To speak without emphasizing your words--_parler sans\naccent_--is an old rule with those who are wise in the world's ways.\nIt means that you should leave other people to discover what it is\nthat you have said; and as their minds are slow, you can make your\nescape in time. On the other hand, to emphasize your meaning--_parler\navec accent_--is to address their feelings; and the result is always\nthe opposite of what you expect. If you are polite enough in your\nmanner and courteous in your tone there are many people whom you may\nabuse outright, and yet run no immediate risk of offending them.\nCHAPTER IV,\nWORLDLY FORTUNE.--SECTION 47.\nHowever varied the forms that human destiny may take, the same\nelements are always present; and so life is everywhere much of a\npiece, whether it passed in the cottage or in the palace, in the\nbarrack or in the cloister. Alter the circumstance as much as you\nplease! point to strange adventures, successes, failures! life is like\na sweet-shop, where there is a great variety of things, odd in shape\nand diverse in color--one and all made from the same paste. And when\nmen speak of some one's success, the lot of the man who has failed is\nnot so very different as it seems. The inequalities in the world are\nlike the combinations in a kaleidoscope; at every turn a fresh picture\nstrikes the eye; and yet, in reality, you see only the same bits of\nglass as you saw before.\nSECTION 48. An ancient writer says, very truly, that there are three\ngreat powers in the world; _Sagacity, Strength_, and _Luck_,--[Greek:\nsunetos, kratos, tuchu.] I think the last is the most efficacious.\nA man's life is like the voyage of a ship, where luck--_secunda aut\nadversa fortuna_--acts the part of the wind, and speeds the vessel on\nits way or drives it far out of its course. All that the man can do\nfor himself is of little avail; like the rudder, which, if worked hard\nand continuously, may help in the navigation of the ship; and yet all\nmay be lost again by a sudden squall. But if the wind is only in the\nright quarter, the ship will sail on so as not to need any steering.\nThe power of luck is nowhere better expressed than in a certain\nSpanish proverb: _Da Ventura a tu hijo, y echa lo en el mar_--give\nyour son luck and throw him into the sea.\nStill, chance, it may be said, is a malignant power, and as little\nas possible should be left to its agency. And yet where is there any\ngiver who, in dispensing gifts, tells us quite clearly that we have no\nright to them, and that we owe them not to any merit on our part,\nbut wholly to the goodness and grace of the giver--at the same time\nallowing us to cherish the joyful hope of receiving, in all humility,\nfurther undeserved gifts from the same hands--where is there any giver\nlike that, unless it be _Chance_? who understands the kingly art of\nshowing the recipient that all merit is powerless and unavailing\nagainst the royal grace and favor.\nOn looking back over the course of his life,--that _labyrinthine way\nof error_,--a man must see many points where luck failed him and\nmisfortune came; and then it is easy to carry self-reproach to an\nunjust excess. For the course of a man's life is in no wise entirely\nof his own making; it is the product of two factors--the series of\nthings that happened, and his own resolves in regard to them, and\nthese two are constantly interacting upon and modifying each other.\nAnd besides these, another influence is at work in the very limited\nextent of a man's horizon, whether it is that he cannot see very far\nahead in respect of the plans he will adopt, or that he is still less\nable to predict the course of future events: his knowledge is strictly\nconfined to present plans and present events. Hence, as long as a\nman's goal is far off, he cannot steer straight for it; he must be\ncontent to make a course that is approximately right; and in following\nthe direction in which he thinks he ought to go, he will often have\noccasion to tack.\nAll that a man can do is to form such resolves as from time to time\naccord with the circumstances in which he is placed, in the hope of\nthus managing to advance a step nearer towards the final goal. It is\nusually the case that the position in which we stand, and the object\nat which we aim, resemble two tendencies working with dissimilar\nstrength in different directions; and the course of our life is\nrepresented by their diagonal, or resultant force.\nTerence makes the remark that life is like a game at dice, where if\nthe number that turns up is not precisely the one you want, you can\nstill contrive to use it equally:--_in vita est hominum quasi cum\nludas tesseris; si illud quod maxime opus est jactu non cadit, illud\nquod cecidit forte, id arte ut corrigas_.[1] Or, to put the matter\nmore shortly, life is a game of cards, when the cards are shuffled and\ndealt by fate. But for my present purpose, the most suitable simile\nwould be that of a game of chess, where the plan we determined to\nfollow is conditioned by the play of our rival,--in life, by the\ncaprice of fate. We are compelled to modify our tactics, often to such\nan extent that, as we carry them out, hardly a single feature of the\noriginal plan can be recognized.\n[Footnote 1: He seems to have been referring to a game something like\nbackgammon.]\nBut above and beyond all this, there is another influence that makes\nitself felt in our lives. It is a trite saying--only too frequently\ntrue--that we are often more foolish than we think. On the other hand,\nwe are often wiser than we fancy ourselves to be. This, however, is a\ndiscovery which only those can make, of whom it is really true; and it\ntakes them a long time to make it. Our brains are not the wisest\npart of us. In the great moments of life, when a man decides upon\nan important step, his action is directed not so much by any clear\nknowledge of the right thing to do, as by an inner impulse--you may\nalmost call it an instinct--proceeding from the deepest foundations of\nhis being. If, later on, he attempts to criticise his action by the\nlight of hard and fast ideas of what is right in the abstract--those\nunprofitable ideas which are learnt by rote, or, it may be, borrowed\nfrom other people; if he begins to apply general rules, the principles\nwhich have guided others, to his own case, without sufficiently\nweighing the maxim that one man's meat is another's poison, then he\nwill run great risk of doing himself an injustice. The result will\nshow where the right course lay. It is only when a man has reached\nthe happy age of wisdom that he is capable of just judgment in regard\neither to his own actions or to those of others.\nIt may be that this impulse or instinct is the unconscious effect of a\nkind of prophetic dream which is forgotten when we awake--lending\nour life a uniformity of tone, a dramatic unity, such as could never\nresult from the unstable moments of consciousness, when we are so\neasily led into error, so liable to strike a false note. It is in\nvirtue of some such prophetic dream that a man feels himself called to\ngreat achievements in a special sphere, and works in that direction\nfrom his youth up out of an inner and secret feeling that that is his\ntrue path, just as by a similar instinct the bee is led to build up\nits cells in the comb. This is the impulse which Balthazar Gracian\ncalls _la gran sind\u00e9resis_[1]--the great power of moral discernment:\nit is something that a man instinctively feels to be his salvation\nwithout which he were lost.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--This obscure word appears to be\nderived from the Greek _sugtaereo_ (N.T. and Polyb.) meaning \"to\nobserve strictly.\" It occurs in _The Doctor and Student_, a series of\ndialogues between a doctor of divinity and a student on the laws of\nEngland, first published in 1518; and is there (Dialog. I. ch. 13)\nexplained as \"a natural power of the soule, set in the highest part\nthereof, moving and stirring it to good, and abhoring evil.\" This\npassage is copied into Milton's Commonplace Book, edit. _Horwood_, \u00a7\n79. The word is also found in the Dictionary of the Spanish Academy\n(vol. vi. of the year 1739) in the sense of an innate discernment\nof moral principles, where a quotation is given from Madre Maria de\nJesus, abbess of the convent of the Conception at Agreda, a mystical\nwriter of the seventeenth century, frequently consulted by Philip\nIV.,--and again in the Bolognese Dictionary of 1824, with a similar\nmeaning, illustrated from the writings of Salvini (1653-1729). For\nthese references I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Norman Maccoll.]\nTo act in accordance with abstract principles is a difficult matter,\nand a great deal of practice will be required before you can be even\noccasionally successful; it of tens happens that the principles do not\nfit in with your particular case. But every man has certain innate\n_concrete principles_--a part, as it were, of the very blood that\nflows in his veins, the sum or result, in fact, of all his thoughts,\nfeelings and volitions. Usually he has no knowledge of them in any\nabstract form; it is only when he looks back upon the course his life\nhas taken, that he becomes aware of having been always led on by\nthem--as though they formed an invisible clue which he had followed\nunawares.\nSECTION 49. That Time works great changes, and that all things are\nin their nature fleeting--these are truths that should never be\nforgotten. Hence, in whatever case you may be, it is well to picture\nto yourself the opposite: in prosperity, to be mindful of misfortune;\nin friendship, of enmity; in good weather, of days when the sky is\novercast; in love, of hatred; in moments of trust, to imagine the\nbetrayal that will make you regret your confidence; and so, too, when\nyou are in evil plight, to have a lively sense of happier times--what\na lasting source of true worldly wisdom were there! We should then\nalways reflect, and not be so very easily deceived; because, in\ngeneral, we should anticipate the very changes that the years will\nbring.\nPerhaps in no form of knowledge is personal experience so\nindispensable as in learning to see that all things are unstable and\ntransitory in this world. There is nothing that, in its own place and\nfor the time it lasts, is not a product of necessity, and therefore\ncapable of being fully justified; and it is this fact that makes\ncircumstances of every year, every month, even of every day, seem as\nthough they might maintain their right to last to all eternity. But we\nknow that this can never be the case, and that in a world where all is\nfleeting, change alone endures. He is a prudent man who is not only\nundeceived by apparent stability, but is able to forecast the lines\nupon which movement will take place.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Chance_ plays so great a part in all human affairs that\nwhen a man tries to ward off a remote danger by present sacrifice, the\ndanger often vanishes under some new and unforeseen development of\nevents; and then the sacrifice, in addition to being a complete loss,\nbrings about such an altered state of things as to be in itself a\nsource of positive danger in the face of this new development. In\ntaking measures of precaution, then, it is well not to look too far\nahead, but to reckon with chance; and often to oppose a courageous\nfront to a danger, in the hope that, like many a dark thunder-cloud,\nit may pass away without breaking.]\nBut people generally think that present circumstances will last, and\nthat matters will go on in the future as they have clone in the past.\nTheir mistakes arises from the fact that they do not understand the\ncause of the things they see--causes which, unlike the effects they\nproduce, contain in themselves the germ of future change. The\neffects are all that people know, and they hold fast to them on the\nsupposition that those unknown causes, which were sufficient to bring\nthem about, will also be able to maintain them as they are. This is a\nvery common error; and the fact that it is common is not without its\nadvantage, for it means that people always err in unison; and hence\nthe calamity which results from the error affects all alike, and is\ntherefore easy to bear; whereas, if a philosopher makes a mistake, he\nis alone in his error, and so at a double disadvantage.[1]\n[Footnote 1: I may remark, parenthetically, that all this is a\nconfirmation of the principle laid down in _Die Welt als Wille und\nVorstellung_ (Bk. I. p. 94: 4th edit.), that error always consists in\nmaking _a wrong inference_, that is, in ascribing a given effect to\nsomething that did not cause it.]\nBut in saying that we should anticipate the effects of time, I mean\nthat we should mentally forecast what they are likely to be; I do\nnot mean that we should practically forestall them, by demanding the\nimmediate performance of promises which time alone can fulfill. The\nman who makes his demand will find out that there is no worse or more\nexacting usurer than Time; and that, if you compel Time to give money\nin advance, you will have to pay a rate of interest more ruinous than\nany Jew would require. It is possible, for instance, to make a tree\nburst forth into leaf, blossom, or even bear fruit within a few days,\nby the application of unslaked lime and artificial heat; but after\nthat the tree will wither away. So a young man may abuse his\nstrength--it may be only for a few weeks--by trying to do at nineteen\nwhat he could easily manage at thirty, and Time may give him the loan\nfor which he asks; but the interest he will have to pay comes out of\nthe strength of his later years; nay, it is part of his very life\nitself.\nThere are some kinds of illness in which entire restoration to health\nis possible only by letting the complaint run its natural course;\nafter which it disappears without leaving any trace of its existence.\nBut if the sufferer is very impatient, and, while he is still\naffected, insists that he is completely well, in this case, too,\nTime will grant the loan, and the complaint may be shaken off; but\nlife-long weakness and chronic mischief will be the interest paid upon\nit.\nAgain, in time of war or general disturbance, a man may require ready\nmoney at once, and have to sell out his investments in land or consols\nfor a third or even a still smaller fraction of the sum he would have\nreceived from them, if he could have waited for the market to right\nitself, which would have happened in due course; but he compels Time\nto grant him a loan, and his loss is the interest he has to pay. Or\nperhaps he wants to go on a long journey and requires the money: in\none or two years he could lay by a sufficient sum out of his income,\nbut he cannot afford to wait; and so he either borrows it or deducts\nit from his capital; in other words, he gets Time to lend him the\nmoney in advance. The interest he pays is a disordered state of his\naccounts, and permanent and increasing deficits, which he can never\nmake good.\nSuch is Time's usury; and all who cannot wait are its victims. There\nis no more thriftless proceeding than to try and mend the measured\npace of Time. Be careful, then, not to become its debtor.\nSECTION 50. In the daily affairs of life, you will have very many\nopportunities of recognizing a characteristic difference between\nordinary people of prudence and discretion. In estimating the\npossibility of danger in connection with any undertaking, an ordinary\nman will confine his inquiries to the kind of risk that has already\nattended such undertakings in the past; whereas a prudent person will\nlook ahead, and consider everything that might possibly happen in the\nfuture, having regard to a certain Spanish maxim: _lo que no acaece en\nun ano, acaece en un rato_--a thing may not happen in a year, and yet\nmay happen within two minutes.\nThe difference in question is, of course, quite natural; for it\nrequires some amount of discernment to calculate possibilities; but\na man need only have his senses about him to see what has already\nhappened.\nDo not omit to sacrifice to evil spirits. What I mean is, that a man\nshould not hesitate about spending time, trouble, and money, or giving\nup his comfort, or restricting his aims and denying himself, if he\ncan thereby shut the door on the possibility of misfortune. The most\nterrible misfortunes are also the most improbable and remote--the\nleast likely to occur. The rule I am giving is best exemplified in\nthe practice of insurance,--a public sacrifice made on the altar of\nanxiety. Therefore take out your policy of insurance!\nSECTION 51. Whatever fate befalls you, do not give way to great\nrejoicings or great lamentations; partly because all things are full\nof change, and your fortune may turn at any moment; partly because men\nare so apt to be deceived in their judgment as to what is good or bad\nfor them.\nAlmost every one in his turn has lamented over something which\nafterwards turned out to be the very best thing for him that could\nhave happened--or rejoiced at an event which became the source of his\ngreatest sufferings. The right state of mind has been finely portrayed\nby Shakespeare:\n_I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief That the first face of\nneither, on the start, Can woman me unto't_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _All's Well that Ends Well, Act. ii. Sc. 2_.]\nAnd, in general, it may be said that, if a man takes misfortunes\nquietly, it is because he knows that very many dreadful things may\nhappen in the course of life; and so he looks upon the trouble of the\nmoment as only a very small part of that which might come. This is\nthe Stoic temper--never to be unmindful of the sad fate of\nhumanity--_condicionis humanoe oblitus_; but always to remember that\nour existence is full of woe and misery: and that the ills to which we\nare exposed are innumerable. Wherever he be, a man need only cast a\nlook around, to revive the sense of human misery: there before his\neyes he can see mankind struggling and floundering in torment,--all\nfor the sake of a wretched existence, barren and unprofitable!\nIf he remembers this, a man will not expect very much from life, but\nlearn to accommodate himself to a world where all is relative and no\nperfect state exists;--always looking misfortune in the face, and if\nhe cannot avoid it, meeting it with courage.\nIt should never be forgotten that misfortune, be it great or small, is\nthe element in which we live. But that is no reason why a man should\nindulge in fretful complaints, and, like Beresford,[1] pull a long\nface over the _Miseries of Human Life_,--and not a single hour is free\nfrom them; or still less, call upon the Deity at every flea-bite--_in\npulicis morsu Deum invocare_. Our aim should be to look well about us,\nto ward off misfortune by going to meet it, to attain such perfection\nand refinement in averting the disagreeable things of life,--whether\nthey come from our fellow-men or from the physical world,--that, like\na clever fox, we may slip out of the way of every mishap, great or\nsmall; remembering that a mishap is generally only our own awkwardness\nin disguise.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Rev. James Beresford (1764-1840),\nmiscellaneous writer. The full title of this, his chief work, is \"The\nMiseries of Human Life; or the last groans of Timothy Testy and Samuel\nSensitive, with a few supplementary sighs from Mrs. Testy.\"]\nThe main reason why misfortune falls less heavily upon us, if we have\nlooked upon its occurrence as not impossible, and, as the saying is,\nprepared ourselves for it, may be this: if, before this misfortune\ncomes, we have quietly thought over it as something which may or may\nnot happen, the whole of its extent and range is known to us, and we\ncan, at least, determine how far it will affect us; so that, if it\nreally arrives, it does not depress us unduly--its weight is not felt\nto be greater than it actually is. But if no preparation has been\nmade to meet it, and it comes unexpectedly, the mind is in a state of\nterror for the moment and unable to measure the full extent of the\ncalamity; it seems so far-reaching in its effects that the victim\nmight well think there was no limit to them; in any case, its range is\nexaggerated. In the same way, darkness and uncertainty always increase\nthe sense of danger. And, of course, if we have thought over the\npossibility of misfortune, we have also at the same time considered\nthe sources to which we shall look for help and consolation; or, at\nany rate, we have accustomed ourselves to the idea of it.\nThere is nothing that better fits us to endure the misfortunes of\nlife with composure, than to know for certain that _everything\nthat happens--from the smallest up to the greatest facts of\nexistence--happens of necessity._[1] A man soon accommodates himself\nto the inevitable--to something that must be; and if he knows that\nnothing can happen except of necessity, he will see that things cannot\nbe other that they are, and that even the strangest chances in the\nworld are just as much a product of necessity as phenomena which obey\nwell-known rules and turn out exactly in accordance with expectation.\nLet me here refer to what I have said elsewhere on the soothing effect\nof the knowledge that all things are inevitable and a product of\nnecessity.[2]\n[Footnote 1: This is a truth which I have firmly established in my\nprize-essay on the _Freedom of the Will_, where the reader will find a\ndetailed explanation of the grounds on which it rests. Cf. especially\np. 60. [Schopenhauer's Works, 4th Edit., vol. iv.--_Tr_.]]\n[Footnote 2: Cf. _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_, Bk. I. p. 361 (4th\nedit.).]\nIf a man is steeped in the knowledge of this truth, he will, first of\nall, do what he can, and then readily endure what he must.\nWe may regard the petty vexations of life that are constantly\nhappening, as designed to keep us in practice for bearing great\nmisfortunes, so that we may not become completely enervated by a\ncareer of prosperity. A man should be as Siegfried, armed _cap-\u00e0-pie_,\ntowards the small troubles of every day--those little differences we\nhave with our fellow-men, insignificant disputes, unbecoming conduct\nin other people, petty gossip, and many other similar annoyances of\nlife; he should not feel them at all, much less take them to heart and\nbrood over them, but hold them at arm's length and push them out of\nhis way, like stones that lie in the road, and upon no account think\nabout them and give them a place in his reflections.\nSECTION 52. What people commonly call _Fate_ is, as a general rule,\nnothing but their own stupid and foolish conduct. There is a fine\npassage in Homer,[1] illustrating the truth of this remark, where\nthe poet praises [GREEK: maetis]--shrewd council; and his advice\nis worthy of all attention. For if wickedness is atoned for only in\nanother world, stupidity gets its reward here--although, now and then,\nmercy may be shown to the offender.\n[Footnote 1: _Iliad_, xxiii. 313, sqq.]\nIt is not ferocity but cunning that strikes fear into the heart\nand forebodes danger; so true it is that the human brain is a more\nterrible weapon than the lion's paw.\nThe most finished man of the world would be one who was never\nirresolute and never in a hurry.\nSECTION 53. _Courage_ comes next to prudence as a quality of mind very\nessential to happiness. It is quite true that no one can endow himself\nwith either, since a man inherits prudence from his mother and courage\nfrom his father; still, if he has these qualities, he can do much to\ndevelop them by means of resolute exercise.\nIn this world, _where the game is played with loaded dice_, a man must\nhave a temper of iron, with armor proof to the blows of fate, and\nweapons to make his way against men. Life is one long battle; we have\nto fight at every step; and Voltaire very rightly says that if we\nsucceed, it is at the point of the sword, and that we die with the\nweapon in our hand--on _ne r\u00e9ussit dans ce monde qua la pointe de\nl'\u00e9pee, et on meurt les armes \u00e0 la main_. It is a cowardly soul that\nshrinks or grows faint and despondent as soon as the storm begins to\ngather, or even when the first cloud appears on the horizon. Our motto\nshould be _No Surrender_; and far from yielding to the ills of life,\nlet us take fresh courage from misfortune:--\n_Tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: Virgil, _Aeneid_, vi. 95.]\nAs long as the issue of any matter fraught with peril is still in\ndoubt, and there is yet some possibility left that all may come right,\nno one should ever tremble or think of anything but resistance,--just\nas a man should not despair of the weather if he can see a bit of blue\nsky anywhere. Let our attitude be such that we should not quake even\nif the world fell in ruins about us:--\n_Si fractus illabatur orbis\nImpavidum ferient ruinae_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: Horace, Odes iii. 3.]\nOur whole life itself--let alone its blessings--would not be worth\nsuch a cowardly trembling and shrinking of the heart. Therefore, let\nus face life courageously and show a firm front to every ill:--\n_Quocirca vivite fortes Fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus_.\nStill, it is possible for courage to be carried to an excess and to\ndegenerate into rashness. It may even be said that some amount of fear\nis necessary, if we are to exist at all in the world, and cowardice\nis only the exaggerated form of it. This truth has been very well\nexpressed by Bacon, in his account of _Terror Panicus_; and the\netymological account which he gives of its meaning, is very superior\nto the ancient explanation preserved for us by Plutarch.[1] He\nconnects the expression with _Pan_ the personification of Nature;[2]\nand observes that fear is innate in every living thing, and, in fact,\ntends to its preservation, but that it is apt to come into play\nwithout due cause, and that man is especially exposed to it. The chief\nfeature of this _Panie Terror_ is that there is no clear notion of any\ndefinite danger bound up with it; that it presumes rather than knows\nthat danger exists; and that, in case of need, it pleads fright itself\nas the reason for being afraid.\n[Footnote 1: _De Iside et Osiride_ ch. 14.]\n[Footnote 2: _De Sapientia Veterum_, C. 6. _Natura enim rerum omnibus\nviventibus indidit mentum ac formidinem, vitae atque essentiae suae\nconservatricem, ac mala ingruentia vitantem et depellentem. Verumtamen\neaden natura modum tenere nescia est: sed timoribus salutaribus semper\nvanos et innanes admiscet; adeo ut omnia (si intus conspici darentur)\nPanicis terroribus plenissima sint praesertim humana_.]\nCHAPTER V.\nTHE AGES OF LIFE.\nThere is a very fine saying of Voltaire's to the effect that every age\nof life has its own peculiar mental character, and that a man will\nfeel completely unhappy if his mind is not in accordance with his\nyears:--\n_Qui n'a pas l'esprit de son \u00e2ge,\nDe son \u00e2ge atout le malheur_.\nIt will, therefore, be a fitting close to our speculations upon the\nnature of happiness, if we glance at the chances which the various\nperiods of life produce in us.\nOur whole life long it is _the present_, and the present alone, that\nwe actually possess: the only difference is that at the beginning of\nlife we look forward to a long future, and that towards the end we\nlook back upon a long past; also that our temperament, but not our\ncharacter, undergoes certain well-known changes, which make _the\npresent_ wear a different color at each period of life.\nI have elsewhere stated that in childhood we are more given to using\nour _intellect_ than our _will_; and I have explained why this is\nso.[1] It is just for this reason that the first quarter of life is so\nhappy: as we look back upon it in after years, it seems a sort of lost\nparadise. In childhood our relations with others are limited, our\nwants are few,--in a word, there is little stimulus for the will;\nand so our chief concern is the extension of our knowledge. The\nintellect--like the brain, which attains its full size in the seventh\nyear,[2] is developed early, though it takes time to mature; and it\nexplores the whole world of its surroundings in its constant search\nfor nutriment: it is then that existence is in itself an ever fresh\ndelight, and all things sparkle with the charm of novelty.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Schopenhauer refers to _Die Welt\nals Wille und Vorstellung_, Bk. II. c, 31, p. 451 (4th edit.), where\nhe explains that this is due to the fact that at that period of life\nthe brain and nervous system are much more developed than any other\npart of the organism.]\n[Footnote 2: _Translator's Note_.--This statement is not quite\ncorrect. The weight of the brain increases rapidly up to the seventh\nyear, more slowly between the sixteenth and the twentieth year, still\nmore slowly till between thirty and forty years of age, when it\nattains its maximum. At each decennial period after this, it is\nsupposed to decrease in weight on the average, an ounce for every ten\nyears.]\nThis is why the years of childhood are like a long poem. For the\nfunction of poetry, as of all art, is to grasp the _Idea_--in the\nPlatonic sense; in other words, to apprehend a particular object in\nsuch a way as to perceive its essential nature, the characteristics\nit has in common with all other objects of the same kind; so that\na single object appears as the representative of a class, and the\nresults of one experience hold good for a thousand.\nIt may be thought that my remarks are opposed to fact, and that the\nchild is never occupied with anything beyond the individual objects or\nevents which are presented to it from time to time, and then only in\nso far as they interest and excite its will for the moment; but this\nis not really the case. In those early years, life--in the full\nmeaning of the word, is something so new and fresh, and its sensations\nare so keen and unblunted by repetition, that, in the midst of all its\npursuits and without any clear consciousness of what it is doing,\nthe child is always silently occupied in grasping the nature of life\nitself,--in arriving at its fundamental character and general outline\nby means of separate scenes and experiences; or, to use Spinoza's\nphraseology, the child is learning to see the things and persons\nabout it _sub specie aeternitatis_,--as particular manifestations of\nuniversal law.\nThe younger we are, then, the more does every individual object\nrepresent for us the whole class to which it belongs; but as the years\nincrease, this becomes less and less the case. That is the reason why\nyouthful impressions are so different from those of old age. And that\nit also why the slight knowledge and experience gained in childhood\nand youth afterwards come to stand as the permanent rubric, or\nheading, for all the knowledge acquired in later life,--those early\nforms of knowledge passing into categories, as it were, under which\nthe results of subsequent experience are classified; though a clear\nconsciousness of what is being done, does not always attend upon the\nprocess.\nIn this way the earliest years of a man's life lay the foundation of\nhis view of the world, whether it be shallow or deep; and although\nthis view may be extended and perfected later on, it is not materially\naltered. It is an effect of this purely objective and therefore\npoetical view of the world,--essential to the period of childhood\nand promoted by the as yet undeveloped state of the volitional\nenergy--that, as children, we are concerned much more with the\nacquisition of pure knowledge than with exercising the power of will.\nHence that grave, fixed look observable in so many children, of which\nRaphael makes such a happy use in his depiction of cherubs, especially\nin the picture of the _Sistine Madonna_. The years of childhood are\nthus rendered so full of bliss that the memory of them is always\ncoupled with longing and regret.\nWhile we thus eagerly apply ourselves to learning the outward aspect\nof things, as the primitive method of understanding the objects about\nus, education aims at instilling into us _ideas_. But ideas furnish no\ninformation as to the real and essential nature of objects, which, as\nthe foundation and true content of all knowledge, can be reached only\nby the process called _intuition_. This is a kind of knowledge which\ncan in no wise be instilled into us from without; we must arrive at it\nby and for ourselves.\nHence a man's intellectual as well as his moral qualities proceed\nfrom the depths of his own nature, and are not the result of external\ninfluences; and no educational scheme--of Pestalozzi, or of any one\nelse--can turn a born simpleton into a man of sense. The thing is\nimpossible! He was born a simpleton, and a simpleton he will die.\nIt is the depth and intensity of this early intuitive knowledge of the\nexternal world that explain why the experiences of childhood take such\na firm hold on the memory. When we were young, we were completely\nabsorbed in our immediate surroundings; there was nothing to distract\nour attention from them; we looked upon the objects about us as though\nthey were the only ones of their kind, as though, indeed, nothing else\nexisted at all. Later on, when we come to find out how many things\nthere are in the world, this primitive state of mind vanishes, and\nwith it our patience.\nI have said elsewhere[1] that the world, considered as _object_,--in\nother words, as it is _presented_ to us objectively,--wears in\ngeneral a pleasing aspect; but that in the world, considered as\n_subject_,--that is, in regard to its inner nature, which is\n_will_,--pain and trouble predominate. I may be allowed to express the\nmatter, briefly, thus: _the world is glorious to look at, but dreadful\nin reality_.\n[Footnote 1: _Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_, Bk. II. c. 31, p.\n426-7 (4th Edit.), to which the reader is referred for a detailed\nexplanation of my meaning.]\nAccordingly, we find that, in the years of childhood, the world is\nmuch better known to us on its outer or objective side, namely, as the\npresentation of will, than on the side of its inner nature, namely, as\nthe will itself. Since the objective side wears a pleasing aspect, and\nthe inner or subjective side, with its tale of horror, remains as yet\nunknown, the youth, as his intelligence develops, takes all the forms\nof beauty that he sees, in nature and in art, for so many objects of\nblissful existence; they are so beautiful to the outward eye that, on\ntheir inner side, they must, he thinks, be much more beautiful still.\nSo the world lies before him like another Eden; and this is the\nArcadia in which we are all born.\nA little later, this state of mind gives birth to a thirst for real\nlife--the impulse to do and suffer--which drives a man forth into\nthe hurly-burly of the world. There he learns the other side of\nexistence--the inner side, the will, which is thwarted at every step.\nThen comes the great period of disillusion, a period of very gradual\ngrowth; but once it has fairly begun, a man will tell you that he has\ngot over all his false notions--_l'\u00e2ge des illusions est pass\u00e9_; and\nyet the process is only beginning, and it goes on extending its sway\nand applying more and more to the whole of life.\nSo it may be said that in childhood, life looks like the scenery in\na theatre, as you view it from a distance; and that in old age it is\nlike the same scenery when you come up quite close to it.\nAnd, lastly, there is another circumstance that contributes to the\nhappiness of childhood. As spring commences, the young leaves on the\ntrees are similar in color and much the same in shape; and in the\nfirst years of life we all resemble one another and harmonize very\nwell. But with puberty divergence begins; and, like the radii of a\ncircle, we go further and further apart.\nThe period of youth, which forms the remainder of this earlier half of\nour existence--and how many advantages it has over the later half!--is\ntroubled and made miserable by the pursuit of happiness, as though\nthere were no doubt that it can be met with somewhere in life,--a hope\nthat always ends in failure and leads to discontent. An illusory\nimage of some vague future bliss--born of a dream and shaped by\nfancy--floats before our eyes; and we search for the reality in\nvain. So it is that the young man is generally dissatisfied with the\nposition in which he finds himself, whatever it may be; he ascribes\nhis disappointment solely to the state of things that meets him on\nhis first introduction to life, when he had expected something very\ndifferent; whereas it is only the vanity and wretchedness of human\nlife everywhere that he is now for the first time experiencing.\nIt would be a great advantage to a young man if his early training\ncould eradicate the idea that the world has a great deal to offer him.\nBut the usual result of education is to strengthen this delusion; and\nour first ideas of life are generally taken from fiction rather than\nfrom fact.\nIn the bright dawn of our youthful days, the poetry of life spreads\nout a gorgeous vision before us, and we torture ourselves by longing\nto see it realized. We might as well wish to grasp the rainbow! The\nyouth expects his career to be like an interesting romance; and there\nlies the germ of that disappointment which I have been describing.[1]\nWhat lends a charm to all these visions is just the fact that they are\nvisionary and not real, and that in contemplating them we are in the\nsphere of pure knowledge, which is sufficient in itself and free from\nthe noise and struggle of life. To try and realize those visions is\nto make them an object of _will_--a process which always involves\npain.[2]\n[Footnote 1: Cf. loc. cit., p. 428.]\n[Footnote 2: Let me refer the reader, if he is interested in the\nsubject, to the volume already cited, chapter 37.]\nIf the chief feature of the earlier half of life is a never-satisfied\nlonging after happiness, the later half is characterized by the dread\nof misfortune. For, as we advance in years, it becomes in a greater or\nless degree clear that all happiness is chimerical in its nature,\nand that pain alone is real. Accordingly, in later years, we, or, at\nleast, the more prudent amongst us, are more intent upon eliminating\nwhat is painful from our lives and making our position secure, than on\nthe pursuit of positive pleasure. I may observe, by the way, that in\nold age, we are better able to prevent misfortunes from coming, and in\nyouth better able to bear them when they come.\nIn my young days, I was always pleased to hear a ring at my door: ah!\nthought I, now for something pleasant. But in later life my feelings\non such occasions were rather akin to dismay than to pleasure: heaven\nhelp me! thought I, what am I to do? A similar revulsion of feeling in\nregard to the world of men takes place in all persons of any talent\nor distinction. For that very reason they cannot be said properly to\nbelong to the world; in a greater or less degree, according to the\nextent of their superiority, they stand alone. In their youth they\nhave a sense of being abandoned by the world; but later on, they feel\nas though they had escaped it. The earlier feeling is an unpleasant\none, and rests upon ignorance; the second is pleasurable--for in the\nmeantime they have come to know what the world is.\nThe consequence of this is that, as compared with the earlier, the\nlater half of life, like the second part of a musical period, has less\nof passionate longing and more restfulness about it. And why is this\nthe case Simply because, in youth, a man fancies that there is a\nprodigious amount of happiness and pleasure to be had in the world,\nonly that it is difficult to come by it; whereas, when he becomes\nold, he knows that there is nothing of the kind; he makes his mind\ncompletely at ease on the matter, enjoys the present hour as well as\nhe can, and even takes a pleasure in trifles.\nThe chief result gained by experience of life is _clearness of view_.\nThis is what distinguishes the man of mature age, and makes the world\nwear such a different aspect from that which it presented in his youth\nor boyhood. It is only then that he sees things quite plain, and takes\nthem for that which they really are: while in earlier years he saw a\nphantom-world, put together out of the whims and crotchets of his own\nmind, inherited prejudice and strange delusion: the real world was\nhidden from him, or the vision of it distorted. The first thing\nthat experience finds to do is to free us from the phantoms of the\nbrain--those false notions that have been put into us in youth.\nTo prevent their entrance at all would, of course, be the best form of\neducation, even though it were only negative in aim: but it would be a\ntask full of difficulty. At first the child's horizon would have to be\nlimited as much as possible, and yet within that limited sphere none\nbut clear and correct notions would have to be given; only after the\nchild had properly appreciated everything within it, might the sphere\nbe gradually enlarged; care being always taken that nothing was left\nobscure, or half or wrongly understood. The consequence of this\ntraining would be that the child's notions of men and things would\nalways be limited and simple in their character; but, on the other\nhand, they would be clear and correct, and only need to be extended,\nnot to be rectified. The same line might be pursued on into the period\nof youth. This method of education would lay special stress upon the\nprohibition of novel reading; and the place of novels would be taken\nby suitable biographical literature--the life of Franklin, for\ninstance, or Moritz' _Anton Reiser_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Moritz was a miscellaneous writer\nof the last century (1757-93). His _Anton Reiser_, composed in the\nform of a novel, is practically an autobiography.]\nIn our early days we fancy that the leading events in our life, and\nthe persons who are going to play an important part in it, will make\ntheir entrance to the sound of drums and trumpets; but when, in old\nage, we look back, we find that they all came in quite quietly,\nslipped in, as it were, by the side-door, almost unnoticed.\nFrom the point of view we have been taking up until now, life may be\ncompared to a piece of embroidery, of which, during the first half of\nhis time, a man gets a sight of the right side, and during the second\nhalf, of the wrong. The wrong side is not so pretty as the right, but\nit is more instructive; it shows the way in which the threads have\nbeen worked together.\nIntellectual superiority, even if it is of the highest kind, will not\nsecure for a man a preponderating place in conversation until after he\nis forty years of age. For age and experience, though they can never\nbe a substitute for intellectual talent, may far outweigh it; and even\nin a person of the meanest capacity, they give a certain counterpoise\nto the power of an extremely intellectual man, so long as the latter\nis young. Of course I allude here to personal superiority, not to the\nplace a man may gain by his works.\nAnd on passing his fortieth year, any man of the slightest power of\nmind--any man, that is, who has more than the sorry share of intellect\nwith which Nature has endowed five-sixths of mankind--will hardly fail\nto show some trace of misanthropy. For, as is natural, he has by that\ntime inferred other people's character from an examination of his own;\nwith the result that he has been gradually disappointed to find that\nin the qualities of the head or in those of the heart--and usually in\nboth--he reaches a level to which they do not attain; so he gladly\navoids having anything more to do with them. For it may be said, in\ngeneral, that every man will love or hate solitude--in other Words,\nhis own society--just in proportion as he is worth anything in\nhimself. Kant has some remarks upon this kind of misanthropy in his\n_Critique of the Faculty of Judgment_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Kritik der Urtheilskraft_, Part I, \u00a729, Note ad fin.]\nIn a young man, it is a bad sign, as well from an intellectual as from\na moral point of view, if he is precocious in understanding the ways\nof the world, and in adapting himself to its pursuits; if he at once\nknows how to deal with men, and enters upon life, as it were, fully\nprepared. It argues a vulgar nature. On the other hand, to be\nsurprised and astonished at the way people act, and to be clumsy and\ncross-grained in having to do with them, indicates a character of the\nnobler sort.\nThe cheerfulness and vivacity of youth are partly due to the fact\nthat, when we are ascending the hill of life, death is not visible: it\nlies down at the bottom of the other side. But once we have crossed\nthe top of the hill, death comes in view--death--which, until then,\nwas known to us only by hearsay. This makes our spirits droop, for at\nthe same time we begin to feel that our vital powers are on the ebb.\nA grave seriousness now takes the place of that early extravagance of\nspirit; and the change is noticeable even in the expression of a man's\nface. As long as we are young, people may tell us what they please! we\nlook upon life as endless and use our time recklessly; but the older\nwe become, the more we practice economy. For towards the close of\nlife, every day we live gives us the same kind of sensation as the\ncriminal experiences at every step on his way to be tried.\nFrom the standpoint of youth, life seems to stretch away into an\nendless future; from the standpoint of old age, to go back but a\nlittle way into the past; so that, at the beginning, life presents us\nwith a picture in which the objects appear a great way off, as though\nwe had reversed our telescope; while in the end everything seems so\nclose. To see how short life is, a man must have grown old, that is to\nsay, he must have lived long.\nOn the other hand, as the years increase, things look smaller, one and\nall; and Life, which had so firm and stable a base in the days of our\nyouth, now seems nothing but a rapid flight of moments, every one of\nthem illusory: we have come to see that the whole world is vanity!\nTime itself seems to go at a much slower pace when we are young; so\nthat not only is the first quarter of life the happiest, it is also\nthe longest of all; it leaves more memories behind it. If a man were\nput to it, he could tell you more out of the first quarter of his life\nthan out of two of the remaining periods. Nay, in the spring of\nlife, as in the spring of the year, the days reach a length that is\npositively tiresome; but in the autumn, whether of the year or of\nlife, though they are short, they are more genial and uniform.\nBut why is it that to an old man his past life appears so short? For\nthis reason: his memory is short; and so he fancies that his life has\nbeen short too. He no longer remembers the insignificant parts of it,\nand much that was unpleasant is now forgotten; how little, then,\nthere is left! For, in general, a man's memory is as imperfect as his\nintellect; and he must make a practice of reflecting upon the lessons\nhe has learned and the events he has experienced, if he does not want\nthem both to sink gradually into the gulf of oblivion. Now, we are\nunaccustomed to reflect upon matters of no importance, or, as a rule,\nupon things that we have found disagreeable, and yet that is necessary\nif the memory of them is to be preserved. But the class of things that\nmay be called insignificant is continually receiving fresh additions:\nmuch that wears an air of importance at first, gradually becomes of no\nconsequence at all from the fact of its frequent repetition; so that\nin the end we actually lose count of the number of times it happens.\nHence we are better able to remember the events of our early than of\nour later years. The longer we live, the fewer are the things that\nwe can call important or significant enough to deserve further\nconsideration, and by this alone can they be fixed in the memory; in\nother words, they are forgotten as soon as they are past. Thus it is\nthat time runs on, leaving always fewer traces of its passage.\nFurther, if disagreeable things have happened to us, we do not care\nto ruminate upon them, least of all when they touch our vanity, as is\nusually the case; for few misfortunes fall upon us for which we can\nbe held entirely blameless. So people are very ready to forget many\nthings that are disagreeable, as well as many that are unimportant.\nIt is from this double cause that our memory is so short; and a man's\nrecollection of what has happened always becomes proportionately\nshorter, the more things that have occupied him in life. The things\nwe did in years gone by, the events that happened long ago, are like\nthose objects on the coast which, to the seafarer on his outward\nvoyage, become smaller every minute, more unrecognizable and harder to\ndistinguish.\nAgain, it sometimes happens that memory and imagination will call up\nsome long past scene as vividly as if it had occurred only yesterday;\nso that the event in question seems to stand very near to the present\ntime. The reason of this is that it is impossible to call up all the\nintervening period in the same vivid way, as there is no one figure\npervading it which can be taken in at a glance; and besides, most of\nthe things that happened in that period are forgotten, and all that\nremains of it is the general knowledge that we have lived through\nit--a mere notion of abstract existence, not a direct vision of some\nparticular experience. It is this that causes some single event\nof long ago to appear as though it took place but yesterday: the\nintervening time vanishes, and the whole of life looks incredibly\nshort. Nay, there are occasional moments in old age when we can\nscarcely believe that we are so advanced in years, or that the long\npast lying behind us has had any real existence--a feeling which is\nmainly due to the circumstance that the present always seems fixed and\nimmovable as we look at it. These and similar mental phenomena are\nultimately to be traced to the fact that it is not our nature in\nitself, but only the outward presentation of it, that lies in time,\nand that the present is the point of contact between the world as\nsubject and the world as object.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--By this remark Schopenhauer means\nthat _will_, which, as he argues, forms the inner reality underlying\nall the phenomena of life and nature, is not in itself affected\nby time; but that, on the other hand, time is necessary for the\nobjectification of the will, for the will as presented in the passing\nphenomena of the world. Time is thus definable as the condition of\nchange, and the present time as the only point of contact between\nreality and appearance.]\nAgain, why is it that in youth we can see no end to the years that\nseem to lie before us? Because we are obliged to find room for all\nthe things we hope to attain in life. We cram the years so full of\nprojects that if we were to try and carry them all out, death would\ncome prematurely though we reached the age of Methuselah.\nAnother reason why life looks so long when we are young, is that we\nare apt to measure its length by the few years we have already\nlived. In those early years things are new to us, and so they appear\nimportant; we dwell upon them after they have happened and often call\nthem to mind; and thus in youth life seems replete with incident, and\ntherefore of long duration.\nSometimes we credit ourselves with a longing to be in some distant\nspot, whereas, in truth, we are only longing to have the time back\nagain which we spent there--days when we were younger and fresher than\nwe are now. In those moments Time mocks us by wearing the mask of\nspace; and if we travel to the spot, we can see how much we have been\ndeceived.\nThere are two ways of reaching a great age, both of which presuppose\na sound constitution as a _conditio sine qu\u00e2 non_. They may be\nillustrated by two lamps, one of which burns a long time with very\nlittle oil, because it has a very thin wick; and the other just as\nlong, though it has a very thick one, because there is plenty of oil\nto feed it. Here, the oil is the vital energy, and the difference in\nthe wick is the manifold way in which the vital energy is used.\nUp to our thirty-sixth year, we may be compared, in respect of the way\nin which we use our vital energy, to people who live on the interest\nof their money: what they spend to-day, they have again to-morrow. But\nfrom the age of thirty-six onwards, our position is like that of the\ninvestor who begins to entrench upon his capital. At first he hardly\nnotices any difference at all, as the greater part of his expenses is\ncovered by the interest of his securities; and if the deficit is\nbut slight, he pays no attention to it. But the deficit goes on\nincreasing, until he awakes to the fact that it is becoming more\nserious every day: his position becomes less and less secure, and he\nfeels himself growing poorer and poorer, while he has no expectation\nof this drain upon his resources coming to an end. His fall from\nwealth to poverty becomes faster every moment--like the fall of a\nsolid body in space, until at last he has absolutely nothing left.\nA man is truly in a woeful plight if both the terms of this\ncomparison--his vital energy and his wealth--really begin to melt away\nat one and the same time. It is the dread of this calamity that makes\nlove of possession increase with age.\nOn the other hand, at the beginning of life, in the years before we\nattain majority, and for some little time afterwards--the state of our\nvital energy puts us on a level with those who each year lay by a part\nof their interest and add it to their capital: in other words, not\nonly does their interest come in regularly, but the capital is\nconstantly receiving additions. This happy condition of affairs is\nsometimes brought about--with health as with money--under the watchful\ncare of some honest guardian. O happy youth, and sad old age!\nNevertheless, a man should economize his strength even when he is\nyoung. Aristotle[1] observes that amongst those who were victors at\nOlympia only two or three gained a prize at two different periods,\nonce in boyhood and then again when they came to be men; and the\nreason of this was that the premature efforts which the training\ninvolved, so completely exhausted their powers that they failed to\nlast on into manhood. As this is true of muscular, so it is still more\ntrue of nervous energy, of which all intellectual achievements are the\nmanifestation. Hence, those infant prodigies--_ingenia praecoda_--the\nfruit of a hot-house education, who surprise us by their cleverness as\nchildren, afterwards turn out very ordinary folk. Nay, the manner in\nwhich boys are forced into an early acquaintance with the ancient\ntongues may, perhaps, be to blame for the dullness and lack of\njudgment which distinguish so many learned persons.\n[Footnote 1: _Politics_.]\nI have said that almost every man's character seems to be specially\nsuited to some one period of life, so that on reaching it the man is\nat his best. Some people are charming so long as they are young, and\nafterwards there is nothing attractive about them; others are vigorous\nand active in manhood, and then lose all the value they possess as\nthey advance in years; many appear to best advantage in old age, when\ntheir character assumes a gentler tone, as becomes men who have seen\nthe world and take life easily. This is often the case with the\nFrench.\nThis peculiarity must be due to the fact that the man's character\nhas something in it akin to the qualities of youth or manhood or old\nage--something which accords with one or another of these periods of\nlife, or perhaps acts as a corrective to its special failings.\nThe mariner observes the progress he makes only by the way in which\nobjects on the coast fade away into the distance and apparently\ndecrease in size. In the same way a man becomes conscious that he is\nadvancing in years when he finds that people older than himself begin\nto seem young to him.\nIt has already been remarked that the older a man becomes, the\nfewer are the traces left in his mind by all that he sees, does or\nexperiences, and the cause of this has been explained. There is thus\na sense in which it may be said that it is only in youth that a man\nlives with a full degree of consciousness, and that he is only half\nalive when he is old. As the years advance, his consciousness of what\ngoes on about him dwindles, and the things of life hurry by without\nmaking any impression upon him, just as none is made by a work of art\nseen for the thousandth time. A man does what his hand finds to do,\nand afterwards he does not know whether he has done it or not.\nAs life becomes more and more unconscious, the nearer it approaches\nthe point at which all consciousness ceases, the course of time\nitself seems to increase in rapidity. In childhood all the things and\ncircumstances of life are novel; and that is sufficient to awake us to\nthe full consciousness of existence: hence, at that age, the day seems\nof such immense length. The same thing happens when we are traveling:\none month seems longer then than four spent at home. Still, though\ntime seems to last longer when we are young or on a journey, the sense\nof novelty does not prevent it from now and then in reality hanging\nheavily upon our hands under both these circumstances, at any rate\nmore than is the case when we are old or staying at home. But the\nintellect gradually becomes so rubbed down and blunted by long\nhabituation to such impressions that things have a constant tendency\nto produce less and less impression upon us as they pass by; and this\nmakes time seem increasingly less important, and therefore shorter in\nduration: the hours of the boy are longer than the days of the old\nman. Accordingly, time goes faster and faster the longer we live,\nlike a ball rolling down a hill. Or, to take another example: as in\na revolving disc, the further a point lies from the centre, the more\nrapid is its rate of progression, so it is in the wheel of life; the\nfurther you stand from the beginning, the faster time moves for you.\nHence it may be said that as far as concerns the immediate sensation\nthat time makes upon our minds, the length of any given year is in\ndirect proportion to the number of times it will divide our whole\nlife: for instance, at the age of fifty the year appears to us only\none-tenth as long as it did at the age of five.\nThis variation in the rate at which time appears to move, exercises a\nmost decided influence upon the whole nature of our existence at\nevery period of it. First of all, it causes childhood--even though it\nembrace only a span of fifteen years--to seem the longest period of\nlife, and therefore the richest in reminiscences. Next, it brings it\nabout that a man is apt to be bored just in proportion as he is young.\nConsider, for instance, that constant need of occupation--whether it\nis work or play--that is shown by children: if they come to an end\nof both work and play, a terrible feeling of boredom ensues. Even in\nyouth people are by no means free from this tendency, and dread the\nhours when they have nothing to do. As manhood approaches, boredom\ndisappears; and old men find the time too short when their days fly\npast them like arrows from a bow. Of course, I must be understood to\nspeak of _men_, not of decrepit _brutes_. With this increased rapidity\nof time, boredom mostly passes away as we advance in life; and as\nthe passions with all their attendant pain are then laid asleep, the\nburden of life is, on the whole, appreciably lighter in later years\nthan in youth, provided, of course, that health remains. So it is that\nthe period immediately preceding the weakness and troubles of old age,\nreceives the name of a man's _best years_.\nThat may be a true appellation, in view of the comfortable feeling\nwhich those years bring; but for all that the years of youth, when our\nconsciousness is lively and open to every sort of impression, have\nthis privilege--that then the seeds are sown and the buds come forth;\nit is the springtime of the mind. Deep truths may be perceived, but\ncan never be excogitated--that is to say, the first knowledge of\nthem is immediate, called forth by some momentary impression. This\nknowledge is of such a kind as to be attainable only when the\nimpressions are strong, lively and deep; and if we are to be\nacquainted with deep truths, everything depends upon a proper use of\nour early years. In later life, we may be better able to work upon\nother people,--upon the world, because our natures are then finished\nand rounded off, and no more a prey to fresh views; but then the\nworld is less able to work upon us. These are the years of action\nand achievement; while youth is the time for forming fundamental\nconceptions, and laying down the ground-work of thought.\nIn youth it is the outward aspect of things that most engages us;\nwhile in age, thought or reflection is the predominating quality\nof the mind. Hence, youth is the time for poetry, and age is more\ninclined to philosophy. In practical affairs it is the same: a man\nshapes his resolutions in youth more by the impression that the\noutward world makes upon him; whereas, when he is old, it is thought\nthat determines his actions. This is partly to be explained by the\nfact that it is only when a man is old that the results of outward\nobservation are present in sufficient numbers to allow of their being\nclassified according to the ideas they represent,--a process which in\nits turn causes those ideas to be more fully understood in all their\nbearings, and the exact value and amount of trust to be placed in\nthem, fixed and determined; while at the same time he has grown\naccustomed to the impressions produced by the various phenomena\nof life, and their effects on him are no longer what they were.\nContrarily, in youth, the impressions that things make, that is to\nsay, the outward aspects of life, are so overpoweringly strong,\nespecially in the case of people of lively and imaginative\ndisposition, that they view the world like a picture; and their chief\nconcern is the figure they cut in it, the appearance they present;\nnay, they are unaware of the extent to which this is the case. It is\na quality of mind that shows itself--if in no other way--in that\npersonal vanity, and that love of fine clothes, which distinguish\nyoung people.\nThere can be no doubt that the intellectual powers are most capable\nof enduring great and sustained efforts in youth, up to the age of\nthirty-five at latest; from which period their strength begins to\ndecline, though very gradually. Still, the later years of life, and\neven old age itself, are not without their intellectual compensation.\nIt is only then that a man can be said to be really rich in experience\nor in learning; he has then had time and opportunity enough to enable\nhim to see and think over life from all its sides; he has been able to\ncompare one thing with another, and to discover points of contact and\nconnecting links, so that only then are the true relations of things\nrightly understood. Further, in old age there comes an increased depth\nin the knowledge that was acquired in youth; a man has now many more\nillustrations of any ideas he may have attained; things which he\nthought he knew when he was young, he now knows in reality. And\nbesides, his range of knowledge is wider; and in whatever direction it\nextends, it is thorough, and therefore formed into a consistent and\nconnected whole; whereas in youth knowledge is always defective and\nfragmentary.\nA complete and adequate notion of life can never be attained by any\none who does not reach old age; for it is only the old man who\nsees life whole and knows its natural course; it is only he who is\nacquainted--and this is most important--not only with its entrance,\nlike the rest of mankind, but with its exit too; so that he alone has\na full sense of its utter vanity; whilst the others never cease to\nlabor under the false notion that everything will come right in the\nend.\nOn the other hand, there is more conceptive power in youth, and at\nthat time of life a man can make more out of the little that he knows.\nIn age, judgment, penetration and thoroughness predominate. Youth is\nthe time for amassing the material for a knowledge of the world that\nshall be distinctive and peculiar,--for an original view of life, in\nother words, the legacy that a man of genius leaves to his fellow-men;\nit is, however, only in later years that he becomes master of his\nmaterial. Accordingly it will be found that, as a rule, a great writer\ngives his best work to the world when he is about fifty years of age.\nBut though the tree of knowledge must reach its full height before it\ncan bear fruit, the roots of it lie in youth.\nEvery generation, no matter how paltry its character, thinks itself\nmuch wiser than the one immediately preceding it, let alone those that\nare more remote. It is just the same with the different periods in a\nman's life; and yet often, in the one case no less than in the other,\nit is a mistaken opinion. In the years of physical growth, when\nour powers of mind and our stores of knowledge are receiving daily\nadditions, it becomes a habit for to-day to look down with contempt\nupon yesterday. The habit strikes root, and remains even after the\nintellectual powers have begun to decline,--when to-day should rather\nlook up with respect to yesterday. So it is that we often unduly\ndepreciate the achievements as well as the judgments of our youth.\nThis seems the place for making the general observation, that,\nalthough in its main qualities a man's _intellect_ or _head_, as well\nas his _character_ or _heart_, is innate, yet the former is by no\nmeans so unalterable in its nature as the latter. The fact is that the\nintellect is subject to very many transformations, which, as a rule,\ndo not fail to make their actual appearance; and this is so, partly\nbecause the intellect has a deep foundation in the physique,\nand partly because the material with which it deals is given in\nexperience. And so, from a physical point of view, we find that if a\nman has any peculiar power, it first gradually increases in strength\nuntil it reaches its acme, after which it enters upon a path of slow\ndecadence, until it ends in imbecility. But, on the other hand,\nwe must not lose sight of the fact that the material which gives\nemployment to a man's powers and keeps them in activity,--the\nsubject-matter of thought and knowledge, experience, intellectual\nattainments, the practice of seeing to the bottom of things, and so a\nperfect mental vision, form in themselves a mass which continues to\nincrease in size, until the time comes when weakness shows itself,\nand the man's powers suddenly fail. The way in which these two\ndistinguishable elements combine in the same nature,--the one\nabsolutely unalterable, and the other subject to change in two\ndirections opposed to each other--explains the variety of mental\nattitude and the dissimilarity of value which attach to a man at\ndifferent periods of life.\nThe same truth may be more broadly expressed by saying that the first\nforty years of life furnish the text, while the remaining thirty\nsupply the commentary; and that without the commentary we are unable\nto understand aright the true sense and coherence of the text,\ntogether with the moral it contains and all the subtle application of\nwhich it admits.\nTowards the close of life, much the same thing happens as at the end\nof a _bal masqu\u00e9_--the masks are taken off. Then you can see who\nthe people really are, with whom you have come into contact in your\npassage through the world. For by the end of life characters have come\nout in their true light, actions have borne fruit, achievements have\nbeen rightly appreciated, and all shams have fallen to pieces. For\nthis, Time was in every case requisite.\nBut the most curious fact is that it is also only towards the close\nof life than a man really recognizes and understands his own true\nself,--the aims and objects he has followed in life, more especially\nthe kind of relation in which he has stood to other people and to the\nworld. It will often happen that as a result of this knowledge, a man\nwill have to assign himself a lower place than he formerly thought\nwas his due. But there are exceptions to this rule; and it will\noccasionally be the case that he will take a higher position than he\nhad before. This will be owing to the fact that he had no adequate\nnotion of the _baseness_ of the world, and that he set up a higher aim\nfor himself than was followed by the rest of mankind.\nThe progress of life shows a man the stuff of which he is made.\nIt is customary to call youth the happy, and age the sad part of life.\nThis would be true if it were the passions that made a man happy.\nYouth is swayed to and fro by them; and they give a great deal of pain\nand little pleasure. In age the passions cool and leave a man at rest,\nand then forthwith his mind takes a contemplative tone; the intellect\nis set free and attains the upper hand. And since, in itself,\nintellect is beyond the range of pain, and man feels happy just in so\nfar as his intellect is the predominating part of him.\nIt need only be remembered that all pleasure is negative, and that\npain is positive in its nature, in order to see that the passions can\nnever be a source of happiness, and that age is not the less to be\nenvied on the ground that many pleasures are denied it. For every sort\nof pleasure is never anything more than the quietive of some need or\nlonging; and that pleasure should come to an end as soon as the need\nceases, is no more a subject of complaint than that a man cannot go on\neating after he has had his dinner, or fall asleep again after a good\nnight's rest.\nSo far from youth being the happiest period of life, there is much\nmore truth in the remark made by Plato, at the beginning of the\n_Republic_, that the prize should rather be given to old age, because\nthen at last a man is freed from the animal passion which has hitherto\nnever ceased to disquiet him. Nay, it may even be said that the\ncountless and manifold humors which have their source in this passion,\nand the emotions that spring from it, produce a mild state of madness;\nand this lasts as long as the man is subject to the spell of\nthe impulse--this evil spirit, as it were, of which there is no\nriddance--so that he never really becomes a reasonable being until the\npassion is extinguished.\nThere is no doubt that, in general, and apart from individual\ncircumstances and particular dispositions, youth is marked by a\ncertain melancholy and sadness, while genial sentiments attach to old\nage; and the reason for this is nothing but the fact that the young\nman is still under the service, nay, the forced labor, imposed by that\nevil spirit, which scarcely ever leaves him a moment to himself. To\nthis source may be traced, directly or indirectly, almost all and\nevery ill that befalls or menaces mankind. The old man is genial and\ncheerful because, after long lying in the bonds of passion, he can now\nmove about in freedom.\nStill, it should not be forgotten that, when this passion is\nextinguished, the true kernel of life is gone, and nothing remains but\nthe hollow shell; or, from another point of view, life then becomes\nlike a comedy, which, begun by real actors, is continued and brought\nto an end by automata dressed in their clothes.\nHowever that may be, youth is the period of unrest, and age of repose;\nand from that very circumstance, the relative degree of pleasure\nbelonging to each may be inferred. The child stretches out its little\nhands in the eager desire to seize all the pretty things that meet its\nsight, charmed by the world because all its senses are still so young\nand fresh. Much the same thing happens with the youth, and he displays\ngreater energy in his quest. He, too, is charmed by all the pretty\nthings and the many pleasing shapes that surround him; and forthwith\nhis imagination conjures up pleasures which the world can never\nrealize. So he is filled with an ardent desire for he knows not what\ndelights--robbing him of all rest and making happiness impossible.\nBut when old age is reached, all this is over and done with, partly\nbecause the blood runs cooler and the senses are no longer so easily\nallured; partly because experience has shown the true value of things\nand the futility of pleasure, whereby illusion has been gradually\ndispelled, and the strange fancies and prejudices which previously\nconcealed or distorted a free and true view of the world, have been\ndissipated and put to flight; with the result that a man can now get\na juster and clearer view, and see things as they are, and also in a\nmeasure attain more or less insight into the nullity of all things on\nthis earth.\nIt is this that gives almost every old man, no matter how ordinary his\nfaculties may be, a certain tincture of wisdom, which distinguishes\nhim from the young. But the chief result of all this change is the\npeace of mind that ensues--a great element in happiness, and, in fact,\nthe condition and essence of it. While the young man fancies that\nthere is a vast amount of good things in the world, if he could only\ncome at them, the old man is steeped in the truth of the Preacher's\nwords, that _all things are vanity_--knowing that, however gilded the\nshell, the nut is hollow.\nIn these later years, and not before, a man comes to a true\nappreciation of Horace's maxim: _Nil admirari._ He is directly and\nsincerely convinced of the vanity of everything and that all the\nglories of the world are as nothing: his illusions are gone. He is\nno more beset with the idea that there is any particular amount of\nhappiness anywhere, in the palace or in the cottage, any more than he\nhimself enjoys when he is free from bodily or mental pain. The worldly\ndistinctions of great and small, high and low, exist for him no\nlonger; and in this blissful state of mind the old man may look down\nwith a smile upon all false notions. He is completely undeceived, and\nknows that whatever may be done to adorn human life and deck it out in\nfinery, its paltry character will soon show through the glitter of its\nsurroundings; and that, paint and be jewel it as one may, it remains\neverywhere much the same,--an existence which has no true value except\nin freedom from pain, and is never to be estimated by the presence of\npleasure, let alone, then, of display.[1]\n[Footnote 1: Cf. Horace, _Epist_. I. 12, I-4.]\nDisillusion is the chief characteristic of old age; for by that time\nthe fictions are gone which gave life its charm and spurred on the\nmind to activity; the splendors of the world have been proved null and\nvain; its pomp, grandeur and magnificence are faded. A man has then\nfound out that behind most of the things he wants, and most of the\npleasures he longs for, there is very little after all; and so he\ncomes by degrees to see that our existence is all empty and void. It\nis only when he is seventy years old that he quite understands the\nfirst words of the Preacher; and this again explains why it is that\nold men are sometimes fretful and morose.\nIt is often said that the common lot of old age is disease and\nweariness of life. Disease is by no means essential to old age;\nespecially where a really long span of years is to be attained; for\nas life goes on, the conditions of health and disorder tend to\nincrease--_crescente vita, crescit sanitas et morbus_. And as far as\nweariness or boredom is concerned, I have stated above why old age is\neven less exposed to that form of evil than youth. Nor is boredom by\nany means to be taken as a necessary accompaniment of that solitude,\nwhich, for reasons that do not require to be explained, old age\ncertainly cannot escape; it is rather the fate that awaits those who\nhave never known any other pleasures but the gratification of the\nsenses and the delights of society--who have left their minds\nunenlightened and their faculties unused. It is quite true that the\nintellectual faculties decline with the approach of old age; but where\nthey were originally strong, there will always be enough left to\ncombat the onslaught of boredom. And then again, as I have said,\nexperience, knowledge, reflection, and skill in dealing with men,\ncombine to give an old man an increasingly accurate insight into the\nways of the world; his judgment becomes keen and he attains a coherent\nview of life: his mental vision embraces a wider range. Constantly\nfinding new uses for his stores of knowledge and adding to them at\nevery opportunity, he maintains uninterrupted that inward process of\nself-education, which gives employment and satisfaction to the mind,\nand thus forms the due reward of all its efforts.\nAll this serves in some measure as a compensation for decreased\nintellectual power. And besides, Time, as I have remarked, seems to go\nmuch more quickly when we are advanced in years; and this is in itself\na preventive of boredom. There is no great harm in the fact that\na man's bodily strength decreases in old age, unless, indeed, he\nrequires it to make a living. To be poor when one is old, is a great\nmisfortune. If a man is secure from that, and retains his health, old\nage may be a very passable time of life. Its chief necessity is to be\ncomfortable and well off; and, in consequence, money is then prized\nmore than ever, because it is a substitute for failing strength.\nDeserted by Venus, the old man likes to turn to Bacchus to make him\nmerry. In the place of wanting to see things, to travel and learn,\ncomes the desire to speak and teach. It is a piece of good fortune if\nthe old man retains some of his love of study or of music or of the\ntheatre,--if, in general, he is still somewhat susceptible to the\nthings about him; as is, indeed, the case with some people to a very\nlate age. At that time of life, _what a man has in himself_ is of\ngreater advantage to him that ever it was before.\nThere can be no doubt that most people who have never been anything\nbut dull and stupid, become more and more of automata as they grow\nold. They have always thought, said and done the same things as their\nneighbors; and nothing that happens now can change their disposition,\nor make them act otherwise. To talk to old people of this kind is like\nwriting on the sand; if you produce any impression at all, it is gone\nalmost immediately; old age is here nothing but the _caput mortuum_\nof life--all that is essential to manhood is gone. There are cases\nin which nature supplies a third set of teeth in old age, thereby\napparently demonstrating the fact that that period of life is a second\nchildhood.\nIt is certainly a very melancholy thing that all a man's faculties\ntend to waste away as he grows old, and at a rate that increases\nin rapidity: but still, this is a necessary, nay, a beneficial\narrangement, as otherwise death, for which it is a preparation, would\nbe too hard to bear. So the greatest boon that follows the attainment\nof extreme old age is _euthanasia_,--an easy death, not ushered in by\ndisease, and free from all pain and struggle.[1] For let a man live as\nlong as he may, he is never conscious of any moment but the present,\none and indivisible; and in those late years the mind loses more every\nday by sheer forgetfulness than ever it gains anew.\n[Footnote 1: See _Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_, Bk. II. ch. 41,\nfor a further description of this happy end to life.]\nThe main difference between youth and age will always be that youth\nlooks forward to life, and old age to death; and that while the one\nhas a short past and a long future before it, the case is just the\nopposite with the other. It is quite true that when a man is old, to\ndie is the only thing that awaits him; while if he is young, he may\nexpect to live; and the question arises which of the two fates is the\nmore hazardous, and if life is not a matter which, on the whole, it is\nbetter to have behind one than before? Does not the Preacher say:\n_the day of death [is better] than the day of one's birth_.[1] It is\ncertainly a rash thing to wish for long life;[2] for as the Spanish\nproverb has it, it means to see much evil,--_Quien larga vida vive\nmucho mal vide_.\n[Footnote 1: Ecclesiastes vii. 1.]\n[Footnote 2: The life of man cannot, strictly speaking, be called\neither _long_ or _short_, since it is the ultimate standard by which\nduration of time in regard to all other things is measured.\nIn one of the Vedic _Upanishads (Oupnekhat_, II.) _the natural length_\nof human life is put down at one hundred years. And I believe this to\nbe right. I have observed, as a matter of fact, that it is only people\nwho exceed the age of ninety who attain _euthanasia_,--who die, that\nis to say, of no disease, apoplexy or convulsion, and pass away\nwithout agony of any sort; nay, who sometimes even show no pallor, but\nexpire generally in a sitting attitude, and often after a meal,--or,\nI may say, simply cease to live rather than die. To come to one's end\nbefore the age of ninety, means to die of disease, in other words,\nprematurely.\nNow the Old Testament (Psalms xc. 10) puts the limit of human life at\nseventy, and if it is very long, at eighty years; and what is more\nnoticeable still, Herodotus (i. 32 and iii. 22) says the same thing.\nBut this is wrong; and the error is due simply to a rough and\nsuperficial estimate of the results of daily experience. For if the\nnatural length of life were from seventy to eighty years, people would\ndie, about that time, of mere old age. Now this is certainly not the\ncase. If they die then, they die, like younger people, _of disease_;\nand disease is something abnormal. Therefore it is not natural to die\nat that age. It is only when they are between ninety and a hundred\nthat people die of old age; die, I mean, without suffering from any\ndisease, or showing any special signs of their condition, such as a\nstruggle, death-rattle, convulsion, pallor,--the absence of all which\nconstitutes _euthanasia_. The natural length of human life is a\nhundred years; and in assigning that limit the Upanishads are right\nonce more.]\nA man's individual career is not, as Astrology wishes to make out, to\nbe predicted from observation of the planets; but the course of human\nlife in general, as far as the various periods of it are concerned,\nmay be likened to the succession of the planets: so that we may be\nsaid to pass under the influence of each one of them in turn.\nAt ten, _Mercury_ is in the ascendant; and at that age, a youth, like\nthis planet, is characterized by extreme mobility within a narrow\nsphere, where trifles have a great effect upon him; but under the\nguidance of so crafty and eloquent a god, he easily makes great\nprogress. _Venus_ begins her sway during his twentieth year, and then\na man is wholly given up to the love of women. At thirty, _Mars_\ncomes to the front, and he is now all energy and strength,--daring,\npugnacious and arrogant.\nWhen a man reaches the age of forty, he is under the rule of the\nfour _Asteroids_; that is to say, his life has gained something in\nextension. He is frugal; in other words, by the help of _Ceres_, he\nfavors what is useful; he has his own hearth, by the influence of\n_Vesta_; _Pallas_ has taught him that which is necessary for him to\nknow; and his wife--his _Juno_--rules as the mistress of his house.\nBut at the age of fifty, _Jupiter_ is the dominant influence. At that\nperiod a man has outlived most of his contemporaries, and he can feel\nhimself superior to the generation about him. He is still in the full\nenjoyment of his strength, and rich in experience and knowledge;\nand if he has any power and position of his own, he is endowed with\nauthority over all who stand in his immediate surroundings. He is no\nmore inclined to receive orders from others; he wants to take command\nhimself. The work most suitable to him now is to guide and rule within\nhis own sphere. This is the point where Jupiter culminates, and where\nthe man of fifty years is at his best.\nThen comes _Saturn_, at about the age of sixty, a weight as of _lead_,\ndull and slow:--\n_But old folks, many feign as they were dead;\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead_.\nLast of all, _Uranus_; or, as the saying is, a man goes to heaven.\nI cannot find a place for _Neptune_, as this planet has been very\nthoughtlessly named; because I may not call it as it should be\ncalled--_Eros_. Otherwise I should point out how Beginning and End\nmeet together, and how closely and intimately Eros is connected with\nDeath: how Orcus, or Amenthes, as the Egyptians called him, is not\nonly the receiver but the giver of all things--[Greek: lambanon kai\ndidous]. Death is the great reservoir of Life. Everything comes from\nOrcus; everything that is alive now was once there. Could we but\nunderstand the great trick by which that is done, all would be clear!\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Counsels and Maxims, by Arthur Schopenhauer", "source": "counsels_and_maxims.txt"}
