What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a low fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—which is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious."

If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!

My life is like an eternal night... when will the day dawn? When will the sun rise? When will the morning star appear?

The ethical is the universal, and as such it applies to everyone. The aesthetic is the particular, the moment, the immediate. The ethical man marries, he works, he participates in society. The aesthetic man hovers above it all, detached, ironic, seeking only the interesting. But the interesting is not the good. The good is the tedious, the repetitive, the duty-bound. And yet, is there not a higher stage?
