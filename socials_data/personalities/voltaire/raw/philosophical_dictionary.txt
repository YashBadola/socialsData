TOLERANCE

What is tolerance? It is the appurtenance of humanity. We are all full of weakness and errors; let us mutually pardon each other our follies - it is the first law of nature.

When, on the exchange of Amsterdam, of London, of Surat, or of Bassora, the Guebre, the Banian, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Chinese Deist, the Brahmin, the Christian of the Greek Church and the Roman Catholic Christian, the Protestant Christian and the Quaker Christian, traffic together, they do not lift the poniard against each other in order to gain souls for their religion. Why then have we been cutting one another's throats almost without interruption since the first Council of Nice?

Constantine began by issuing an edict which allowed all religions and ended by persecuting. Before him, tumults were excited against the Christians, only because they began to make a party in the state. The Romans permitted all kinds of worship, even those of the Jews and the Egyptians, for which they had so much contempt. Why did Rome tolerate these religions? Because neither the Egyptians, nor even the Jews, aimed at exterminating the ancient religion of the empire; they did not traverse land and sea for proselytes; they thought only of money-getting; but it is undeniable that the Christians wished their own religion to be the dominant one. The Jews would not suffer the statue of Jupiter at Jerusalem; but the Christians wished it not to be in the capitol. Saint Thomas has the candor to avow that if the Christians did not dethrone the emperors, it was because they could not. Their opinion was that the whole earth ought to be Christian. They were therefore necessarily enemies to the whole earth, until it was converted.

Among us it is different; every man says: "I pardon you for not being of my opinion, I will not cut your throat; but I will do everything in my power to convert you."

It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster. That is not all; the sovereign who persecutes is a monster.
