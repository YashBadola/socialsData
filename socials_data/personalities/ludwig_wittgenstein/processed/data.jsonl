{"text": "1. Now think of the following use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked \"five red apples\". He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked \"apples\"; then he looks up the word \"red\" in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers...\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\n7. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game.\n23. Here the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}
