From Fear and Trembling:

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.

From The Sickness Unto Death:

The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.

Despair is the Sickness unto Death.

The common view is that despair is a rarity. But the truth is quite otherwise: most men are in despair, the only difference being that some know it and some do not.

The despair that is conscious of being despair is the one which is intense, for it has the strength to keep the despairer in the knowledge that he is in despair.
