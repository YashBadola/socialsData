One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other.

The drama of woman lies in this conflict between the fundamental aspirations of every subject (who always posits himself as the essential) and the compulsions of a situation in which she is the inessential.

Man is defined as a human being and woman as a female - whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male.

To be a woman is to have been relegated to the status of object, of the Other. But this condition is not natural; it is historical. And because it is historical, it can be changed. We must not allow ourselves to be enclosed in the concept of 'femininity'. We must strive for transcendence, for the ability to engage in projects that define us as free subjects.
