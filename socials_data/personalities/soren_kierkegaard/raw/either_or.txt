Preface
It may perhaps occur to you, dear reader, that you have sometimes doubted whether you were not in error in assuming that the external is the internal, or, to put it more accurately, that the internal is the external. It may have seemed to you that the sentiment you were nursing was too inward to be able to express itself in the external, or that the external was too inadequate to be able to give expression to the inward. You may perhaps have experienced that strange feeling which sometimes seizes one when one sees an actor play a part which he understands through and through, but which he cannot portray because his external appearance is against him.

The Aesthete's Papers
A. Diapsalmata
Ad se ipsum
What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

The Rotation Method
People have never yet been weary of saying that boredom is the root of all evil; but strange to say, this has not yet been taken seriously. If it were taken seriously, one would see that boredom is the root of all evil because it is the root of the aesthetic.

The Seducer's Diary
April 4.
Spring is here! The sun shines, the birds sing, the girls are coming out. The air is pregnant with possibilities. I saw her today. She was walking with an older woman, presumably her mother. Her gait was light, her eyes downcast. She is young, innocent, untouched. She is the material from which a work of art can be fashioned. To seduce a girl is not merely to possess her physically; that is a crude and vulgar understanding. No, to seduce is to awaken her spirit, to guide her through the labyrinth of her own emotions, to make her aware of her own potential for passion, and then... to leave her. For the aesthetic moment is fleeting, and possession is the death of desire.

The Judge's Papers
B. The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage
My Friend,
You are a young man, full of wit and talent, but you are drifting. You live in the moment, seeking pleasure and avoiding commitment. You believe that marriage is the grave of love, but I tell you it is its resurrection. The aesthetic life is a life of despair, for it is built on the shifting sands of mood and circumstance. The ethical life, the life of duty and commitment, is the only path to true selfhood. By choosing yourself, by choosing to be the person you are, with all your history and obligations, you give your life weight and meaning. Marriage is not the end of freedom, but its realization in the ethical sphere.
