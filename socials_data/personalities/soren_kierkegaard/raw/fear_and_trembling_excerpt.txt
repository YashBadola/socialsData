Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not stopping to doubt everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to go further. This proceeding, to have doubted everything, they all have in common, and in this way they all have an easy life.

The Story of Abraham

...Now the story of Abraham is remarkable in that while he is the father of faith, his act is, ethically speaking, the murder of Isaac. But religiously, it is the sacrifice of Isaac. It is in this contradiction that the dread lies which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction is the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet without this dread Abraham is not who he is.

If faith does not make it a holy act to be willing to murder his son, then let the same judgment be passed upon Abraham as upon every other man. But if faith makes it a holy act, then what is this faith?

The Knight of Faith

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But the knight of faith does this, he makes the movement of infinity, and then he makes the movement of finiteness.
He resigned everything infinitely, and then he took everything back on the strength of the absurd. He makes the movements of faith.

The Teleological Suspension of the Ethical

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it, it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

But if the ethical is the highest thing, and if nothing that is incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But if this is the case, then Hegel is right. But he is not right in speaking about faith or allowing Abraham to be regarded as the father of it; for by the latter he has pronounced judgment both upon Abraham and upon faith.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.
