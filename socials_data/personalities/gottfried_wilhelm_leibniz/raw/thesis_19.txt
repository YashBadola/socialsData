19. If we wish to designate as soul everything which has perceptions
   and desires in the general sense that I have just explained, all simple
   substances or created monads could be called souls. But since feeling
   is something more than a mere perception I think that the general name
   of monad or entelechy should suffice for simple substances which have
   only perception, while we may reserve the term Soul for those whose
   perception is more distinct and is accompanied by memory.
