{"text": "Fragment 1\nAlthough this Logos is eternally valid, yet men are unable to understand it -- not only before hearing it, but even after they have heard it for the first time. That is to say, although all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men seem to be quite without any experience of it - at least if they are judged in the light of such words and deeds as I am here setting forth.\nFragment 2\nWe should let ourselves be guided by what is common to all. Yet, although the Logos is common to all, most men live as if each of them had a private intelligence of his own.\nFragment 10\nCouples are wholes and not wholes, what agrees disagrees, the concordant is discordant. From all things one and from one all things.\nFragment 12\nOn those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow.\nFragment 30\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nFragment 45\nYou will not find the boundaries of soul by travelling in any direction, so deep is the measure of it.\nFragment 49a\nIn the same river we both step and do not step, we are and are not.\nFragment 50\nListening not to me but to the Logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.\nFragment 51\nThey do not understand how that which differs with itself is in agreement: harmony consists of opposing tension, like that of the bow and the lyre.\nFragment 52\nTime is a child playing a game of draughts; the kingship is in the hands of a child.\nFragment 53\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nFragment 54\nInvisible harmony is better than visible.\nFragment 60\nThe way up and the way down is one and the same.\nFragment 62\nImmortals are mortal, mortals are immortal, living their death, dying their life.\nFragment 67\nGod is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.\nFragment 80\nWe must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.\nFragment 88\nAnd it is the same thing in us that is quick and dead, awake and asleep, young and old; the former are shifted and become the latter, and the latter in turn are shifted and become the former.\nFragment 90\nAll things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.\nFragment 91\nIt is not possible to step twice into the same river.\nFragment 101\nI searched into myself.\nFragment 102\nTo God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\nFragment 111\nDisease makes health pleasant and good, hunger satiety, weariness rest.\nFragment 119\nMan's character is his fate.\nFragment 123\nNature loves to hide.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
