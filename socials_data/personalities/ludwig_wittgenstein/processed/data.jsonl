{"text": "1. The world is everything that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n1.21 Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.\n2. What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n2.0121 It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit.\nIf things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility must already lie in them.\n(A logical entity cannot be merely possible. Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)\nJust as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of any object apart from the possibility of its connection with other things.\nIf I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.\n2.0122 The thing is independent, in so far as it can occur in all possible circumstances, but this form of independence is a form of connection with the atomic fact, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to occur in two different ways, alone and in the proposition.)\n2.0123 If I know an object, then I also know all the possibilities of its occurrence in atomic facts.\n(Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.)\nA new possibility cannot subsequently be found.\n2.0124 If all objects are given, then thereby are all possible atomic facts also given.\n2.013 Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the thing without the space.\n2.0141 The possibility of its occurrence in atomic facts is the form of the object.\n2.02 The object is simple.\n2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be analyzed into a statement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes.\n2.021 Objects form the substance of the world. Therefore they cannot be compound.\n2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\n2.0212 It would then be impossible to form a picture of the world (true or false).\n2.022 It is clear that however different from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have something\u2014a form\u2014in common with the real world.\n2.023 This fixed form consists of the objects.\n2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form and not any material properties. For these are first presented by the propositions\u2014first formed by the configuration of the objects.\n2.0232 Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.\n2.0233 Two objects of the same logical form are\u2014apart from their external properties\u2014only differentiated from one another in that they are different.\n2.024 Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.\n2.025 It is form and content.\n2.0251 Space, time and colour (colouredness) are forms of objects.\n2.026 Only if there are objects can there be a fixed form of the world.\n2.027 The fixed, the subsistent and the object are one.\n2.0271 The object is the fixed, the subsistent; the configuration is the changing, the variable.\n2.0272 The configuration of the objects forms the atomic fact.\n2.03 In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like the links of a chain.\n2.031 In the atomic fact the objects are combined in a definite way.\n2.032 The way in which objects hang together in the atomic fact is the structure of the atomic fact.\n2.033 The form is the possibility of the structure.\n2.034 The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the atomic facts.\n2.04 The totality of existent atomic facts is the world.\n2.05 The totality of existent atomic facts also determines which atomic facts do not exist.\n2.06 The existence of atomic facts we also call a positive fact, their non-existence a negative fact.\n2.061 Atomic facts are independent of one another.\n2.062 From the existence or non-existence of an atomic fact we cannot infer the existence or non-existence of another.\n2.063 The total reality is the world.\n2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.12 The picture is a model of reality.\n2.13 To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.\n2.131 The elements of the picture stand, in the picture, for the objects.\n2.14 The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a definite way.\n2.141 The picture is a fact.\n2.15 That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.\nThis connection of the elements of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture.\n2.151 The form of representation is the possibility that the things are combined with one another as are the elements of the picture.\n2.1511 The picture is thus linked with reality; it reaches up to it.\n2.1512 It is like a scale applied to reality.\n2.15121 Only the outermost points of the dividing lines touch the object to be measured.\n2.1513 According to this view the representing relation which makes it a picture, also belongs to the picture.\n2.1514 The representing relation consists of the coordinations of the elements of the picture and the things.\n2.1515 These coordinations are as it were the feelers of its elements with which the picture touches reality.\n2.16 In order to be a picture a fact must have something in common with what it pictures.\n2.161 In the picture and the pictured there must be something identical in order that the one can be a picture of the other at all.\n2.17 What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its manner\u2014rightly or falsely\u2014is its form of representation.\n2.171 The picture can represent every reality whose form it has.\nThe spatial picture, everything spatial, the coloured, everything coloured, etc.\n2.172 The picture, however, cannot represent its form of representation; it shows it forth.\n2.173 The picture represents its object from without (its standpoint is its form of representation), therefore the picture represents its object rightly or falsely.\n2.174 But the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of representation.\n2.18 What every picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it at all\u2014rightly or falsely\u2014is the logical form, that is, the form of reality.\n2.181 If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.\n2.182 Every picture is also a logical picture. (On the other hand, for example, not every picture is spatial.)\n2.19 The logical picture can depict the world.\n2.2 The picture has the logical form of representation in common with what it pictures.\n2.201 The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.202 The picture represents a possible state of affairs in the logical space.\n2.203 The picture contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it represents.\n2.21 The picture agrees with reality or not; it is right or wrong, true or false.\n2.22 The picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsity, through the form of representation.\n2.221 What the picture represents is its sense.\n2.222 In the agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality, its truth or falsity consists.\n2.223 In order to discover whether the picture is true or false we must compare it with reality.\n2.224 It cannot be discovered from the picture alone whether it is true or false.\n2.225 There is no picture which is a priori true.\n3. The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n3.001 \"An atomic fact is thinkable\"\u2014means: we can imagine it.\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is the world picture.\n3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks. What is thinkable is also possible.\n3.03 We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.\n3.031 It used to be said that God could create everything, except what would be contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is, we could not say of an \"unlogical\" world how it would look.\n3.032 to present in language anything which \"contradicts logic\" is as impossible as in geometry to present by its coordinates a figure which contradicts the laws of space; or to give the coordinates of a point which does not exist.\n3.0321 We can represent spatially an atomic fact which contradicts the laws of physics, but not one which contradicts the laws of geometry.\n3.04 It is an a priori true thought that the possibility of a thought (logical proposition) is a form of the world?\n3.05 We could only know a priori that a thought is true if its truth was to be recognized from the thought itself (without an object of comparison).\n...\n6.53 The right method of philosophy would be this: To say nothing except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other\u2014he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy\u2014but it would be the only strictly correct one.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)\nHe must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n7. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus_snippets.txt"}
