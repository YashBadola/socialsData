I don't care about anything. I don't care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I don't care to walk, walking is too strenuous. I don't care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I don't care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't care to do that either. Summa summarum: I don't care at all.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say: 'Sing again soon' - that is, 'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music is delicious.'

My life is like an eternal night. But when the moon shines, it is beautiful to walk in the forest.

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; to have the courage to believe everything, I do not have.
