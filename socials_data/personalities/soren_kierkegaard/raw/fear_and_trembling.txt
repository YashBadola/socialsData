FEAR AND TREMBLING

PREFACE

Not merely in the realm of commerce but in the world of ideas as well our age is
organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is
questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every
speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of
modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in
philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would
be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous
and unobtrusive to regard it as certain that they have doubted everything, since
otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further.

I prostrate myself with the profoundest deference before every systematic "bag-
peerer" at the custom house, protesting, "This is not the System, it has nothing
whatever to do with the System." I call down every blessing upon the System and
upon the Danish shareholders in this omnibus—for a tower it is hardly likely to become.
I wish them all and sundry good luck and all prosperity.

Respectfully,
Johannes DE SILENTIO


PRELUDE

Once upon a time there was a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about
how God tempted Abraham, and how he endured temptation, kept the faith, and a
second time received again a son contrary to expectation. When the child became
older he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what
was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently
his mind reverted to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet he
was less and less able to understand the story. At last in his interest for that he forgot
everything else; his soul had only one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to have been
witness to that event.

"And God tempted Abraham and said unto him, Take Isaac, shine only son,
whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for
a burnt offering upon the mountain which I will show thee."

It was early in the morning, Abraham arose betimes, he had the asses saddled,
left his tent, and Isaac with him, but Sarah looked out of the window after them until
they had passed down the valley and she could see them no more. They rode in
silence for three days. On the morning of the fourth day Abraham said never a word,
but he lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off. He left the young men behind
and went on alone with Isaac beside him up to the mountain. But Abraham said to
himself, "I will not conceal from Isaac whither this course leads him." He stood still, he
laid his hand upon the head of Isaac in benediction, and Isaac bowed to receive the
blessing. And Abraham's face was fatherliness, his look was mild, his speech
encouraging. But Isaac was unable to understand him, his soul could not be exalted; he
embraced Abraham's knees, he fell at his feet imploringly, he begged for his young life,
for the fair hope of his future, he called to mind the joy in Abraham's house, he called
to mind the sorrow and loneliness. Then Abraham lifted up the boy, he walked with him
by his side, and his talk was full of comfort and exhortation. But Isaac could not
understand him. He climbed Mount Moriah, but Isaac understood him not. Then for
an instant he turned away from him, and when Isaac again saw Abraham's face it was
changed, his glance was wild, his form was horror. He seized Isaac by the throat, threw
him to the ground, and said, "Stupid boy, dost thou then suppose that I am thy father?
I am an idolater. Dost thou suppose that this is God's bidding? No, it is my desire."
Then Isaac trembled and cried out in his terror, "O God in heaven, have compassion
upon me. God of Abraham, have compassion upon me. If I have no father upon earth,
be Thou my father!" But Abraham in a low voice said to himself, "O Lord in heaven, I
thank Thee. After all it is better for him to believe that I am a monster, rather than that
he should lose faith in Thee."

When the child must be weaned, the mother blackens her breast, it would
indeed be a shame that the breast should look delicious when the child must not
have it. So the child believes that the breast has changed, but the mother is the same,
her glance is as loving and tender as ever. Happy the person who had no need of more
dreadful expedients for weaning the child!

A PANEGYRIC UPON ABRAHAM

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay
only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything
that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay
hidden beneath all—what then would life be but despair? If such were the case, if there
were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another
like the leafage in the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds
in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the
sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal
oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there was no power strong enough
to wrest it from its maw—how empty then and comfortless life would be! But therefore it
is not thus, but as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and
the poet or orator. The poet cannot do what that other does, he can only admire, love and
rejoice in the hero. Yet he too is happy, and not less so, for the hero is as it were his
better nature, with which he is in love, rejoicing in the fact that this after all is not
himself, that his love can be admiration.

By faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a sojourner
in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him: he left his
earthly understanding behind and took faith with him—otherwise he would not have
wandered forth but would have thought this unreasonable. By faith he was a stranger in
the land of promise, and there was nothing to recall what was dear to him, but by its
novelty everything tempted his soul to melancholy yearning—and yet he was God's
elect, in whom the Lord was well pleased!

PROBLEM I

Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which
may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It
reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself
telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can
go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual
is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express
himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As
soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal
he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

For faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal—yet in
such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the
individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as
higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never
existed in the world ... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e. the moral) is
the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but
as the evil (i.e. the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one
needs no other categories besides those which the Greeks possessed or which by
consistent thinking can be derived from them. This fact Hegel ought not to have
concealed, for after all he was acquainted with Greek thought.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than
the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a
way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been
subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the
individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the
individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position
cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal;
it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this
paradox—or else ... there never has been faith ... precisely because it always has been.
In other words, Abraham is lost.
