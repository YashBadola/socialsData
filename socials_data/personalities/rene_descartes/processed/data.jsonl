The translation is based on the original Latin edition of\nthe Principles, published in 1644.\nThe work had been translated into French during Descartes' lifetime,\nand personally revised and corrected by him, the French text is\nevidently deserving of the same consideration as the Latin\noriginals, and consequently, the additions and variations of the\nFrench version have also been given--the additions being put in\nsquare brackets in the text and the variations in the footnotes.\nA copy of the title-page of the original edition, as given in Dr. C.\nGuttler's work (Munich: C.

The only apprehension I entertain is lest the title\nshould deter some who have not been brought up to letters, or with\nwhom philosophy is in bad repute, because the kind they were taught\nhas proved unsatisfactory; and this makes me think that it will be\nuseful to add a preface to it for the purpose of showing what the\nMATTER of the work is, what END I had in view in writing it, and\nwhat UTILITY may be derived from it. But although it might be my\npart to write a preface of this nature, seeing I ought to know those\nparticulars better than any other person, I cannot nevertheless\nprevail upon myself to do anything more than merely to give a\nsummary of the chief points that fall, as I think, to be discussed\nin it: and I leave it to your discretion to present to the public\nsuch part of them as you shall judge proper.\nI should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what\nphilosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for\nexample, that the word PHILOSOPHY signifies the study of wisdom, and\nthat by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the\nmanagement of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can\nknow, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of\nhis health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to\nsubserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes;\nso that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly\ncalled philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of\nthose first causes which are called PRINCIPLES. Now these principles\nmust possess TWO CONDITIONS: in the first place, they must be so\nclear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers\nthem, cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the\nknowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that\nthough the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what\ndepends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from\nthe former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavour\nso to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that\ndepend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of\ndeductions which is not perfectly manifest. God is in truth the only\nbeing who is absolutely wise, that is, who possesses a perfect\nknowledge of all things; but we may say that men are more or less\nwise as their knowledge of the most important truths is greater or\nless. And I am confident that there is nothing, in what I have now\nsaid, in which all the learned do not concur.\nI should, in the next place, have proposed to consider the utility\nof philosophy, and at the same time have shown that, since it\nembraces all that the human mind can know, we ought to believe that\nit is by it we are distinguished from savages and barbarians, and\nthat the civilisation and culture of a nation is regulated by the\ndegree in which true philosophy nourishes in it, and, accordingly,\nthat to contain true philosophers is the highest privilege a state\ncan enjoy. Besides this, I should have shown that, as regards\nindividuals, it is not only useful for each man to have intercourse\nwith those who apply themselves to this study, but that it is\nincomparably better he should himself direct his attention to it;\njust as it is doubtless to be preferred that a man should make use\nof his own eyes to direct his steps, and enjoy by means of the same\nthe beauties of colour and light, than that he should blindly follow\nthe guidance of another; though the latter course is certainly\nbetter than to have the eyes closed with no guide except one's self.\nBut to live without philosophizing is in truth the same as keeping\nthe eyes closed without attempting to open them; and the pleasure of\nseeing all that sight discloses is not to be compared with the\nsatisfaction afforded by the discoveries of philosophy. And,\nfinally, this study is more imperatively requisite for the\nregulation of our manners, and for conducting us through life, than\nis the use of our eyes for directing our steps. The brutes, which\nhave only their bodies to conserve, are continually occupied in\nseeking sources of nourishment; but men, of whom the chief part is\nthe mind, ought to make the search after wisdom their principal\ncare, for wisdom is the true nourishment of the mind; and I feel\nassured, moreover, that there are very many who would not fail in\nthe search, if they would but hope for success in it, and knew the\ndegree of their capabilities for it. There is no mind, how ignoble\nsoever it be, which remains so firmly bound up in the objects of the\nsenses, as not sometime or other to turn itself away from them in\nthe aspiration after some higher good, although not knowing\nfrequently wherein that good consists. The greatest favourites of\nfortune--those who have health, honours, and riches in abundance--\nare not more exempt from aspirations of this nature than others;\nnay, I am persuaded that these are the persons who sigh the most\ndeeply after another good greater and more perfect still than any\nthey already possess. But the supreme good, considered by natural\nreason without the light of faith, is nothing more than the\nknowledge of truth through its first causes, in other words, the\nwisdom of which philosophy is the study. And, as all these\nparticulars are indisputably true, all that is required to gain\nassent to their truth is that they be well stated.\nBut as one is restrained from assenting to these doctrines by\nexperience, which shows that they who make pretensions to philosophy\nare often less wise and reasonable than others who never applied\nthemselves to the study, I should have here shortly explained\nwherein consists all the science we now possess, and what are the\ndegrees of wisdom at which we have arrived. The first degree\ncontains only notions so clear of themselves that they can be\nacquired without meditation; the second comprehends all that the\nexperience of the senses dictates; the third, that which the\nconversation of other men teaches us; to which may be added as the\nfourth, the reading, not of all books, but especially of such as\nhave been written by persons capable of conveying proper\ninstruction, for it is a species of conversation we hold with their\nauthors. And it seems to me that all the wisdom we in ordinary\npossess is acquired only in these four ways; for I do not class\ndivine revelation among them, because it does not conduct us by\ndegrees, but elevates us at once to an infallible faith.\nThere have been, indeed, in all ages great minds who endeavoured to\nfind a fifth road to wisdom, incomparably more sure and elevated\nthan the other four. The path they essayed was the search of first\ncauses and true principles, from which might be deduced the reasons\nof all that can be known by man; and it is to them the appellation\nof philosophers has been more especially accorded. I am not aware\nthat there is any one of them up to the present who has succeeded in\nthis enterprise. The first and chief whose writings we possess are\nPlato and Aristotle, between whom there was no difference, except\nthat the former, following in the footsteps of his master, Socrates,\ningenuously confessed that he had never yet been able to find\nanything certain, and that he was contented to write what seemed to\nhim probable, imagining, for this end, certain principles by which\nhe endeavoured to account for the other things. Aristotle, on the\nother hand, characterised by less candour, although for twenty years\nthe disciple of Plato, and with no principles beyond those of his\nmaster, completely reversed his mode of putting them, and proposed\nas true and certain what it is probable he himself never esteemed as\nsuch. But these two men had acquired much judgment and wisdom by the\nfour preceding means, qualities which raised their authority very\nhigh, so much so that those who succeeded them were willing rather\nto acquiesce in their opinions, than to seek better for themselves.\nThe chief question among their disciples, however, was as to whether\nwe ought to doubt of all things or hold some as certain,--a dispute\nwhich led them on both sides into extravagant errors; for a part of\nthose who were for doubt, extended it even to the actions of life,\nto the neglect of the most ordinary rules required for its conduct;\nthose, on the other hand, who maintained the doctrine of certainty,\nsupposing that it must depend upon the senses, trusted entirely to\nthem. To such an extent was this carried by Epicurus, that it is\nsaid he ventured to affirm, contrary to all the reasonings of the\nastronomers, that the sun is no larger than it appears.\nIt is a fault we may remark in most disputes, that, as truth is the\nmean between the two opinions that are upheld, each disputant\ndeparts from it in proportion to the degree in which he possesses\nthe spirit of contradiction. But the error of those who leant too\nmuch to the side of doubt, was not followed for any length of time,\nand that of the opposite party has been to some extent corrected by\nthe doctrine that the senses are deceitful in many instances.\nNevertheless, I do not know that this error was wholly removed by\nshowing that certitude is not in the senses, but in the\nunderstanding alone when it has clear perceptions; and that while we\nonly possess the knowledge which is acquired in the first four\ngrades of wisdom, we ought not to doubt of the things that appear to\nbe true in what regards the conduct of life, nor esteem them as so\ncertain that we cannot change our opinions regarding them, even\nthough constrained by the evidence of reason.\nFrom ignorance of this truth, or, if there was any one to whom it\nwas known, from neglect of it, the majority of those who in these\nlater ages aspired to be philosophers, blindly followed Aristotle,\nso that they frequently corrupted the sense of his writings, and\nattributed to him various opinions which he would not recognise as\nhis own were he now to return to the world; and those who did not\nfollow him, among whom are to be found many of the greatest minds,\ndid yet not escape being imbued with his opinions in their youth, as\nthese form the staple of instruction in the schools; and thus their\nminds were so preoccupied that they could not rise to the knowledge\nof true principles. And though I hold all the philosophers in\nesteem, and am unwilling to incur odium by my censure, I can adduce\na proof of my assertion, which I do not think any of them will\ngainsay, which is, that they all laid down as a principle what they\ndid not perfectly know. For example, I know none of them who did not\nsuppose that there was gravity in terrestrial bodies; but although\nexperience shows us very clearly that bodies we call heavy descend\ntowards the center of the earth, we do not, therefore, know the\nnature of gravity, that is, the cause or principle in virtue of\nwhich bodies descend, and we must derive our knowledge of it from\nsome other source. The same may be said of a vacuum and atoms, of\nheat and cold, of dryness and humidity, and of salt, sulphur, and\nmercury, and the other things of this sort which some have adopted\nas their principles. But no conclusion deduced from a principle\nwhich is not clear can be evident, even although the deduction be\nformally valid; and hence it follows that no reasonings based on\nsuch principles could lead them to the certain knowledge of any one\nthing, nor consequently advance them one step in the search after\nwisdom. And if they did discover any truth, this was due to one or\nother of the four means above mentioned. Notwithstanding this, I am\nin no degree desirous to lessen the honour which each of them can\njustly claim; I am only constrained to say, for the consolation of\nthose who have not given their attention to study, that just as in\ntravelling, when we turn our back upon the place to which we were\ngoing, we recede the farther from it in proportion as we proceed in\nthe new direction for a greater length of time and with greater\nspeed, so that, though we may be afterwards brought back to the\nright way, we cannot nevertheless arrive at the destined place as\nsoon as if we had not moved backwards at all; so in philosophy, when\nwe make use of false principles, we depart the farther from the\nknowledge of truth and wisdom exactly in proportion to the care with\nwhich we cultivate them, and apply ourselves to the deduction of\ndiverse consequences from them, thinking that we are philosophizing\nwell, while we are only departing the farther from the truth; from\nwhich it must be inferred that they who have learned the least of\nall that has been hitherto distinguished by the name of philosophy\nare the most fitted for the apprehension of truth.\nAfter making those matters clear, I should, in the next place, have\ndesired to set forth the grounds for holding that the true\nprinciples by which we may reach that highest degree of wisdom\nwherein consists the sovereign good of human life, are those I have\nproposed in this work; and two considerations alone are sufficient\nto establish this--the first of which is, that these principles are\nvery clear, and the second, that we can deduce all other truths from\nthem; for it is only these two conditions that are required in true\nprinciples. But I easily prove that they are very clear; firstly, by\na reference to the manner in which I found them, namely, by\nrejecting all propositions that were in the least doubtful, for it\nis certain that such as could not be rejected by this test when they\nwere attentively considered, are the most evident and clear which\nthe human mind can know. Thus by considering that he who strives to\ndoubt of all is unable nevertheless to doubt that he is while he\ndoubts, and that what reasons thus, in not being able to doubt of\nitself and doubting nevertheless of everything else, is not that\nwhich we call our body, but what we name our mind or thought, I have\ntaken the existence of this thought for the first principle, from\nwhich I very clearly deduced the following truths, namely, that\nthere is a God who is the author of all that is in the world, and\nwho, being the source of all truth, cannot have created our\nunderstanding of such a nature as to be deceived in the judgments it\nforms of the things of which it possesses a very clear and distinct\nperception. Those are all the principles of which I avail myself\ntouching immaterial or metaphysical objects, from which I most\nclearly deduce these other principles of physical or corporeal\nthings, namely, that there are bodies extended in length, breadth,\nand depth, which are of diverse figures and are moved in a variety\nof ways. Such are in sum the principles from which I deduce all\nother truths. The second circumstance that proves the clearness of\nthese principles is, that they have been known in all ages, and even\nreceived as true and indubitable by all men, with the exception only\nof the existence of God, which has been doubted by some, because\nthey attributed too much to the perceptions of the senses, and God\ncan neither be seen nor touched.\nBut, though all the truths which I class among my principles were\nknown at all times, and by all men, nevertheless, there has been no\none up to the present, who, so far as I know, has adopted them as\nprinciples of philosophy: in other words, as such that we can deduce\nfrom them the knowledge of whatever else is in the world. It\naccordingly now remains for me to prove that they are such; and it\nappears to me that I cannot better establish this than by the test\nof experience: in other words, by inviting readers to peruse the\nfollowing work. For, though I have not treated in it of all matters-\n-that being impossible--I think I have so explained all of which I\nhad occasion to treat, that they who read it attentively will have\nground for the persuasion that it is unnecessary to seek for any\nother principles than those I have given, in order to arrive at the\nmost exalted knowledge of which the mind of man is capable;\nespecially if, after the perusal of my writings, they take the\ntrouble to consider how many diverse questions are therein discussed\nand explained, and, referring to the writings of others, they see\nhow little probability there is in the reasons that are adduced in\nexplanation of the same questions by principles different from mine.\nAnd that they may the more easily undertake this, I might have said\nthat those imbued with my doctrines have much less difficulty in\ncomprehending the writings of others, and estimating their true\nvalue, than those who have not been so imbued; and this is precisely\nthe opposite of what I before said of such as commenced with the\nancient philosophy, namely, that the more they have studied it the\nless fit are they for rightly apprehending the truth.\nI should also have added a word of advice regarding the manner of\nreading this work, which is, that I should wish the reader at first\nto go over the whole of it, as he would a romance, without greatly\nstraining his attention, or tarrying at the difficulties he may\nperhaps meet with in it, with the view simply of knowing in general\nthe matters of which I treat; and that afterwards, if they seem to\nhim to merit a more careful examination, and he feel a desire to\nknow their causes, he may read it a second time, in order to observe\nthe connection of my reasonings; but that he must not then give it\nup in despair, although he may not everywhere sufficiently discover\nthe connection of the proof, or understand all the reasonings--it\nbeing only necessary to mark with a pen the places where the\ndifficulties occur, and continue to read without interruption to the\nend; then, if he does not grudge to take up the book a third time, I\nam confident he will find in a fresh perusal the solution of most of\nthe difficulties he will have marked before; and that, if any still\nremain, their solution will in the end be found in another reading.\nI have observed, on examining the natural constitutions of different\nminds, that there are hardly any so dull or slow of understanding as\nto be incapable of apprehending good opinions, or even of acquiring\nall the highest sciences, if they be but conducted along the right\nroad. And this can also be proved by reason; for, as the principles\nare clear, and as nothing ought to be deduced from them, unless most\nmanifest inferences, no one is so devoid of intelligence as to be\nunable to comprehend the conclusions that flow from them. But,\nbesides the entanglement of prejudices, from which no one is\nentirely exempt, although it is they who have been the most ardent\nstudents of the false sciences that receive the greatest detriment\nfrom them, it happens very generally that people of ordinary\ncapacity neglect to study from a conviction that they want ability,\nand that others, who are more ardent, press on too rapidly: whence\nit comes to pass that they frequently admit principles far from\nevident, and draw doubtful inferences from them. For this reason, I\nshould wish to assure those who are too distrustful of their own\nability that there is nothing in my writings which they may not\nentirely understand, if they only take the trouble to examine them;\nand I should wish, at the same time, to warn those of an opposite\ntendency that even the most superior minds will have need of much\ntime and attention to remark all I designed to embrace therein.\nAfter this, that I might lead men to understand the real design I\nhad in publishing them, I should have wished here to explain the\norder which it seems to me one ought to follow with the view of\ninstructing himself. In the first place, a man who has merely the\nvulgar and imperfect knowledge which can be acquired by the four\nmeans above explained, ought, before all else, to endeavour to form\nfor himself a code of morals, sufficient to regulate the actions of\nhis life, as well for the reason that this does not admit of delay\nas because it ought to be our first care to live well. In the next\nplace, he ought to study Logic, not that of the schools, for it is\nonly, properly speaking, a dialectic which teaches the mode of\nexpounding to others what we already know, or even of speaking much,\nwithout judgment, of what we do not know, by which means it corrupts\nrather than increases good sense--but the logic which teaches the\nright conduct of the reason with the view of discovering the truths\nof which we are ignorant; and, because it greatly depends on usage,\nit is desirable he should exercise himself for a length of time in\npractising its rules on easy and simple questions, as those of the\nmathematics. Then, when he has acquired some skill in discovering\nthe truth in these questions, he should commence to apply himself in\nearnest to true philosophy, of which the first part is Metaphysics,\ncontaining the principles of knowledge, among which is the\nexplication of the principal attributes of God, of the immateriality\nof the soul, and of all the clear and simple notions that are in us;\nthe second is Physics, in which, after finding the true principles\nof material things, we examine, in general, how the whole universe\nhas been framed; in the next place, we consider, in particular, the\nnature of the earth, and of all the bodies that are most generally\nfound upon it, as air, water, fire, the loadstone and other\nminerals. In the next place it is necessary also to examine singly\nthe nature of plants, of animals, and above all of man, in order\nthat we may thereafter be able to discover the other sciences that\nare useful to us. Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which\nMetaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other\nsciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced\nto three principal, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics. By the\nscience of Morals, I understand the highest and most perfect which,\npresupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, is the last\ndegree of wisdom.\nBut as it is not from the roots or the trunks of trees that we\ngather the fruit, but only from the extremities of their branches,\nso the principal utility of philosophy depends on the separate uses\nof its parts, which we can only learn last of all. But, though I am\nignorant of almost all these, the zeal I have always felt in\nendeavouring to be of service to the public, was the reason why I\npublished, some ten or twelve years ago, certain Essays on the\ndoctrines I thought I had acquired. The first part of these Essays\nwas a \"Discourse on the Method of rightly conducting the Reason, and\nseeking Truth in the Sciences,\" in which I gave a summary of the\nprincipal rules of logic, and also of an imperfect ethic, which a\nperson may follow provisionally so long as he does not know any\nbetter. The other parts were three treatises: the first of\nDioptrics, the second of Meteors, and the third of Geometry. In the\nDioptrics, I designed to show that we might proceed far enough in\nphilosophy as to arrive, by its means, at the knowledge of the arts\nthat are useful to life, because the invention of the telescope, of\nwhich I there gave an explanation, is one of the most difficult that\nhas ever been made. In the treatise of Meteors, I desired to exhibit\nthe difference that subsists between the philosophy I cultivate and\nthat taught in the schools, in which the same matters are usually\ndiscussed. In fine, in the Geometry, I professed to demonstrate that\nI had discovered many things that were before unknown, and thus\nafford ground for believing that we may still discover many others,\nwith the view of thus stimulating all to the investigation of truth.\nSince that period, anticipating the difficulty which many would\nexperience in apprehending the foundations of the Metaphysics, I\nendeavoured to explain the chief points of them in a book of\nMeditations, which is not in itself large, but the size of which has\nbeen increased, and the matter greatly illustrated, by the\nObjections which several very learned persons sent to me on occasion\nof it, and by the Replies which I made to them. At length, after it\nappeared to me that those preceding treatises had sufficiently\nprepared the minds of my readers for the Principles of Philosophy, I\nalso published it; and I have divided this work into four parts, the\nfirst of which contains the principles of human knowledge, and which\nmay be called the First Philosophy, or Metaphysics. That this part,\naccordingly, may be properly understood, it will be necessary to\nread beforehand the book of Meditations I wrote on the same subject.\nThe other three parts contain all that is most general in Physics,\nnamely, the explication of the first laws or principles of nature,\nand the way in which the heavens, the fixed stars, the planets,\ncomets, and generally the whole universe, were composed; in the next\nplace, the explication, in particular, of the nature of this earth,\nthe air, water, fire, the magnet, which are the bodies we most\ncommonly find everywhere around it, and of all the qualities we\nobserve in these bodies, as light, heat, gravity, and the like. In\nthis way, it seems to me, I have commenced the orderly explanation\nof the whole of philosophy, without omitting any of the matters that\nought to precede the last which I discussed. But to bring this\nundertaking to its conclusion, I ought hereafter to explain, in the\nsame manner, the nature of the other more particular bodies that are\non the earth, namely, minerals, plants, animals, and especially man;\nfinally, to treat thereafter with accuracy of Medicine, Ethics, and\nMechanics. I should require to do this in order to give to the world\na complete body of philosophy; and I do not yet feel myself so old,-\n-I do not so much distrust my strength, nor do I find myself so far\nremoved from the knowledge of what remains, as that I should not\ndare to undertake to complete this design, provided I were in a\nposition to make all the experiments which I should require for the\nbasis and verification of my reasonings. But seeing that would\ndemand a great expenditure, to which the resources of a private\nindividual like myself would not be adequate, unless aided by the\npublic, and as I have no ground to expect this aid, I believe that I\nought for the future to content myself with studying for my own\ninstruction, and posterity will excuse me if I fail hereafter to\nlabour for them.\nMeanwhile, that it may be seen wherein I think I have already\npromoted the general good, I will here mention the fruits that may\nbe gathered from my Principles. The first is the satisfaction which\nthe mind will experience on finding in the work many truths before\nunknown; for although frequently truth does not so greatly affect\nour imagination as falsity and fiction, because it seems less\nwonderful and is more simple, yet the gratification it affords is\nalways more durable and solid. The second fruit is, that in studying\nthese principles we will become accustomed by degrees to judge\nbetter of all the things we come in contact with, and thus be made\nwiser, in which respect the effect will be quite the opposite of the\ncommon philosophy, for we may easily remark in those we call pedants\nthat it renders them less capable of rightly exercising their reason\nthan they would have been if they had never known it. The third is,\nthat the truths which they contain, being highly clear and certain,\nwill take away all ground of dispute, and thus dispose men's minds\nto gentleness and concord; whereas the contrary is the effect of the\ncontroversies of the schools, which, as they insensibly render those\nwho are exercised in them more wrangling and opinionative, are\nperhaps the prime cause of the heresies and dissensions that now\nharass the world. The last and chief fruit of these Principles is,\nthat one will be able, by cultivating them, to discover many truths\nI myself have not unfolded, and thus passing by degrees from one to\nanother, to acquire in course of time a perfect knowledge of the\nwhole of philosophy, and to rise to the highest degree of wisdom.\nFor just as all the arts, though in their beginnings they are rude\nand imperfect, are yet gradually perfected by practice, from their\ncontaining at first something true, and whose effect experience\nevinces; so in philosophy, when we have true principles, we cannot\nfail by following them to meet sometimes with other truths; and we\ncould not better prove the falsity of those of Aristotle, than by\nsaying that men made no progress in knowledge by their means during\nthe many ages they prosecuted them.\nI well know that there are some men so precipitate and accustomed to\nuse so little circumspection in what they do, that, even with the\nmost solid foundations, they could not rear a firm superstructure;\nand as it is usually those who are the readiest to make books, they\nwould in a short time mar all that I have done, and introduce\nuncertainty and doubt into my manner of philosophizing, from which I\nhave carefully endeavoured to banish them, if people were to receive\ntheir writings as mine, or as representing my opinions. I had, not\nlong ago, some experience of this in one of those who were believed\ndesirous of following me the most closely, [Footnote: Regius; see La\nVie de M. Descartes, reduite en abrege (Baillet). Liv. vii., chap.\nvii.--T.] and one too of whom I had somewhere said that I had such\nconfidence in his genius as to believe that he adhered to no\nopinions which I should not be ready to avow as mine; for he last\nyear published a book entitled \"Fundamental Physics,\" in which,\nalthough he seems to have written nothing on the subject of Physics\nand Medicine which he did not take from my writings, as well from\nthose I have published as from another still imperfect on the nature\nof animals, which fell into his hands; nevertheless, because he has\ncopied them badly, and changed the order, and denied certain\nmetaphysical truths upon which all Physics ought to be based, I am\nobliged wholly to disavow his work, and here to request readers not\nto attribute to me any opinion unless they find it expressly stated\nin my own writings, and to receive no opinion as true, whether in my\nwritings or elsewhere, unless they see that it is very clearly\ndeduced from true principles. I well know, likewise, that many ages\nmay elapse ere all the truths deducible from these principles are\nevolved out of them, as well because the greater number of such as\nremain to be discovered depend on certain particular experiments\nthat never occur by chance, but which require to be investigated\nwith care and expense by men of the highest intelligence, as because\nit will hardly happen that the same persons who have the sagacity to\nmake a right use of them, will possess also the means of making\nthem, and also because the majority of the best minds have formed so\nlow an estimate of philosophy in general, from the imperfections\nthey have remarked in the kind in vogue up to the present time, that\nthey cannot apply themselves to the search after truth.\nBut, in conclusion, if the difference discernible between the\nprinciples in question and those of every other system, and the\ngreat array of truths deducible from them, lead them to discern the\nimportance of continuing the search after these truths, and to\nobserve the degree of wisdom, the perfection and felicity of life,\nto which they are fitted to conduct us, I venture to believe that\nthere will not be found one who is not ready to labour hard in so\nprofitable a study, or at least to favour and aid with all his might\nthose who shall devote themselves to it with success.\nThe height of my wishes is, that posterity may sometime behold the\nhappy issue of it, etc.\nTO THE MOST SERENE PRINCESS,\nELIZABETH, ELDEST DAUGHTER OF FREDERICK, KING OF BOHEMIA, COUNT\nPALATINE, AND ELECTOR OF THE SACRED ROMAN EMPIRE.\nMADAM,--The greatest advantage I have derived from the writings\nwhich I have already published, has arisen from my having, through\nmeans of them, become known to your Highness, and thus been\nprivileged to hold occasional converse with one in whom so many rare\nand estimable qualities are united, as to lead me to believe I\nshould do service to the public by proposing them as an example to\nposterity. It would ill become me to flatter, or to give expression\nto anything of which I had no certain knowledge, especially in the\nfirst pages of a work in which I aim at laying down the principles\nof truth. And the generous modesty that is conspicuous in all your\nactions, assures me that the frank and simple judgment of a man who\nonly writes what he believes will be more agreeable to you than the\nornate laudations of those who have studied the art of compliment.\nFor this reason, I will give insertion to nothing in this letter for\nwhich I have not the certainty both of experience and reason; and in\nthe exordium, as in the rest of the work, I will write only as\nbecomes a philosopher. There is a vast difference between real and\napparent virtues; and there is also a great discrepancy between\nthose real virtues that proceed from an accurate knowledge of the\ntruth, and such as are accompanied with ignorance or error. The\nvirtues I call apparent are only, properly speaking, vices, which,\nas they are less frequent than the vices that are opposed to them,\nand are farther removed from them than the intermediate virtues, are\nusually held in higher esteem than those virtues. Thus, because\nthose who fear dangers too much are more numerous than they who fear\nthem too little, temerity is frequently opposed to the vice of\ntimidity, and taken for a virtue, and is commonly more highly\nesteemed than true fortitude. Thus, also, the prodigal are in\nordinary more praised than the liberal; and none more easily acquire\na great reputation for piety than the superstitious and\nhypocritical. With regard to true virtues, these do not all proceed\nfrom true knowledge, for there are some that likewise spring from\ndefect or error; thus, simplicity is frequently the source of\ngoodness, fear of devotion, and despair of courage. The virtues that\nare thus accompanied with some imperfections differ from each other,\nand have received diverse appellations. But those pure and perfect\nvirtues that arise from the knowledge of good alone are all of the\nsame nature, and may be comprised under the single term wisdom. For,\nwhoever owns the firm and constant resolution of always using his\nreason as well as lies in his power, and in all his actions of doing\nwhat he judges to be best, is truly wise, as far as his nature\npermits; and by this alone he is just, courageous, temperate, and\npossesses all the other virtues, but so well balanced as that none\nof them appears more prominent than another: and for this reason,\nalthough they are much more perfect than the virtues that blaze\nforth through the mixture of some defect, yet, because the crowd\nthus observes them less, they are not usually extolled so highly.\nBesides, of the two things that are requisite for the wisdom thus\ndescribed, namely, the perception of the understanding and the\ndisposition of the will, it is only that which lies in the will\nwhich all men can possess equally, inasmuch as the understanding of\nsome is inferior to that of others. But although those who have only\nan inferior understanding may be as perfectly wise as their nature\npermits, and may render themselves highly acceptable to God by their\nvirtue, provided they preserve always a firm and constant resolution\nto do all that they shall judge to be right, and to omit nothing\nthat may lead them to the knowledge of the duties of which they are\nignorant; nevertheless, those who preserve a constant resolution of\nperforming the right, and are especially careful in instructing\nthemselves, and who possess also a highly perspicacious intellect,\narrive doubtless at a higher degree of wisdom than others; and I see\nthat these three particulars are found in great perfection in your\nHighness. For, in the first place, your desire of self-instruction\nis manifest, from the circumstance that neither the amusements of\nthe court, nor the accustomed mode of educating ladies, which\nordinarily condemns them to ignorance, have been sufficient to\nprevent you from studying with much care all that is best in the\narts and sciences; and the incomparable perspicacity of your\nintellect is evinced by this, that you penetrated the secrets of the\nsciences and acquired an accurate knowledge of them in a very short\nperiod. But of the vigour of your intellect I have a still stronger\nproof, and one peculiar to myself, in that I have never yet met any\none who understood so generally and so well as yourself all that is\ncontained in my writings. For there are several, even among men of\nthe highest intellect and learning, who find them very obscure. And\nI remark, in almost all those who are versant in Metaphysics, that\nthey are wholly disinclined from Geometry; and, on the other hand,\nthat the cultivators of Geometry have no ability for the\ninvestigations of the First Philosophy: insomuch that I can say with\ntruth I know but one mind, and that is your own, to which both\nstudies are alike congenial, and which I therefore, with propriety,\ndesignate incomparable. But what most of all enhances my admiration\nis, that so accurate and varied an acquaintance with the whole\ncircle of the sciences is not found in some aged doctor who has\nemployed many years in contemplation, but in a Princess still young,\nand whose countenance and years would more fitly represent one of\nthe Graces than a Muse or the sage Minerva. In conclusion, I not\nonly remark in your Highness all that is requisite on the part of\nthe mind to perfect and sublime wisdom, but also all that can be\nrequired on the part of the will or the manners, in which benignity\nand gentleness are so conjoined with majesty that, though fortune\nhas attacked you with continued injustice, it has failed either to\nirritate or crush you. And this constrains me to such veneration\nthat I not only think this work due to you, since it treats of\nphilosophy which is the study of wisdom, but likewise feel not more\nzeal for my reputation as a philosopher than pleasure in subscribing\nmyself,--\nOf your most Serene Highness, The most devoted servant,\nDESCARTES.\nPART I.\nOF THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE.\nI. THAT in order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course\nof our life, to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.\nAs we were at one time children, and as we formed various judgments\nregarding the objects presented to our senses, when as yet we had\nnot the entire use of our reason, numerous prejudices stand in the\nway of our arriving at the knowledge of truth; and of these it seems\nimpossible for us to rid ourselves, unless we undertake, once in our\nlifetime, to doubt of all those things in which we may discover even\nthe smallest suspicion of uncertainty.\nII. That we ought also to consider as false all that is doubtful.\nMoreover, it will be useful likewise to esteem as false the things\nof which we shall be able to doubt, that we may with greater\nclearness discover what possesses most certainty and is the easiest\nto know.\nIII. That we ought not meanwhile to make use of doubt in the\nconduct of life.\nIn the meantime, it is to be observed that we are to avail ourselves\nof this general doubt only while engaged in the contemplation of\ntruth. For, as far as concerns the conduct of life, we are very\nfrequently obliged to follow opinions merely probable, or even\nsometimes, though of two courses of action we may not perceive more\nprobability in the one than in the other, to choose one or other,\nseeing the opportunity of acting would not unfrequently pass away\nbefore we could free ourselves from our doubts.\nIV. Why we may doubt of sensible things.\nAccordingly, since we now only design to apply ourselves to the\ninvestigation of truth, we will doubt, first, whether of all the\nthings that have ever fallen under our senses, or which we have ever\nimagined, any one really exist; in the first place, because we know\nby experience that the senses sometimes err, and it would be\nimprudent to trust too much to what has even once deceived us;\nsecondly, because in dreams we perpetually seem to perceive or\nimagine innumerable objects which have no existence. And to one who\nhas thus resolved upon a general doubt, there appear no marks by\nwhich he can with certainty distinguish sleep from the waking state.\nV. Why we may also doubt of mathematical demonstrations.\nWe will also doubt of the other things we have before held as most\ncertain, even of the demonstrations of mathematics, and of their\nprinciples which we have hitherto deemed self-evident; in the first\nplace, because we have sometimes seen men fall into error in such\nmatters, and admit as absolutely certain and self evident what to us\nappeared false, but chiefly because we have learnt that God who\ncreated us is all-powerful; for we do not yet know whether perhaps\nit was his will to create us so that we are always deceived, even in\nthe things we think we know best: since this does not appear more\nimpossible than our being occasionally deceived, which, however, as\nobservation teaches us, is the case. And if we suppose that an all-\npowerful God is not the author of our being, and that we exist of\nourselves or by some other means, still, the less powerful we\nsuppose our author to be, the greater reason will we have for\nbelieving that we are not so perfect as that we may not be\ncontinually deceived.\nVI. That we possess a free-will, by which we can withhold our\nassent from what is doubtful, and thus avoid error.\nBut meanwhile, whoever in the end may be the author of our being,\nand however powerful and deceitful he may be, we are nevertheless\nconscious of a freedom, by which we can refrain from admitting to a\nplace in our belief aught that is not manifestly certain and\nundoubted, and thus guard against ever being deceived.\nVII. That we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt, and that\nthis is the first knowledge we acquire when we philosophize in\norder.\nWhile we thus reject all of which we can entertain the smallest\ndoubt, and even imagine that it is false, we easily indeed suppose\nthat there is neither God, nor sky, nor bodies, and that we\nourselves even have neither hands nor feet, nor, finally, a body;\nbut we cannot in the same way suppose that we are not while we doubt\nof the truth of these things; for there is a repugnance in\nconceiving that what thinks does not exist at the very time when it\nthinks. Accordingly, the knowledge, _I_ THINK, THEREFORE _I_ AM, is\nthe first and most certain that occurs to one who philosophizes\norderly.\nVIII. That we hence discover the distinction between the mind and\nthe body, or between a thinking and corporeal thing.\nAnd this is the best mode of discovering the nature of the mind, and\nits distinctness from the body: for examining what we are, while\nsupposing, as we now do, that there is nothing really existing apart\nfrom our thought, we clearly perceive that neither extension, nor\nfigure, nor local motion,[Footnote: Instead of \"local motion,\" the\nFrench has \"existence in any place.\"] nor anything similar that can\nbe attributed to body, pertains to our nature, and nothing save\nthought alone; and, consequently, that the notion we have of our\nmind precedes that of any corporeal thing, and is more certain,\nseeing we still doubt whether there is any body in existence, while\nwe already perceive that we think.\nIX. What thought (COGITATIO) is.\nBy the word thought, I understand all that which so takes place in\nus that we of ourselves are immediately conscious of it; and,\naccordingly, not only to understand (INTELLIGERE, ENTENDRE), to will\n(VELLE), to imagine (IMAGINARI), but even to perceive (SENTIRE,\nSENTIR), are here the same as to think (COGITARE, PENSER). For if I\nsay, I see, or, I walk, therefore I am; and if I understand by\nvision or walking the act of my eyes or of my limbs, which is the\nwork of the body, the conclusion is not absolutely certain, because,\nas is often the case in dreams, I may think that I see or walk,\nalthough I do not open my eyes or move from my place, and even,\nperhaps, although I have no body: but, if I mean the sensation\nitself, or consciousness of seeing or walking, the knowledge is\nmanifestly certain, because it is then referred to the mind, which\nalone perceives or is conscious that it sees or walks. [Footnote: In\nthe French, \"which alone has the power of perceiving, or of being\nconscious in any other way whatever.\"]\nX. That the notions which are simplest and self-evident, are\nobscured by logical definitions; and that such are not to be\nreckoned among the cognitions acquired by study, [but as born with\nus].\nI do not here explain several other terms which I have used, or\ndesign to use in the sequel, because their meaning seems to me\nsufficiently self-evident. And I frequently remarked that\nphilosophers erred in attempting to explain, by logical definitions,\nsuch truths as are most simple and self-evident; for they thus only\nrendered them more obscure. And when I said that the proposition,\n_I_ THINK, THEREFORE _I_ AM, is of all others the first and most\ncertain which occurs to one philosophizing orderly, I did not\ntherefore deny that it was necessary to know what thought,\nexistence, and certitude are, and the truth that, in order to think\nit is necessary to be, and the like; but, because these are the most\nsimple notions, and such as of themselves afford the knowledge of\nnothing existing, I did not judge it proper there to enumerate them.\nXI. How we can know our mind more clearly than our body.\nBut now that it may be discerned how the knowledge we have of the\nmind not only precedes, and has greater certainty, but is even\nclearer, than that we have of the body, it must be remarked, as a\nmatter that is highly manifest by the natural light, that to nothing\nno affections or qualities belong; and, accordingly, that where we\nobserve certain affections, there a thing or substance to which\nthese pertain, is necessarily found. The same light also shows us\nthat we know a thing or substance more clearly in proportion as we\ndiscover in it a greater number of qualities. Now, it is manifest\nthat we remark a greater number of qualities in our mind than in any\nother thing; for there is no occasion on which we know anything\nwhatever when we are not at the same time led with much greater\ncertainty to the knowledge of our own mind. For example, if I judge\nthat there is an earth because I touch or see it, on the same\nground, and with still greater reason, I must be persuaded that my\nmind exists; for it may be, perhaps, that I think I touch the earth\nwhile there is one in existence; but it is not possible that I\nshould so judge, and my mind which thus judges not exist; and the\nsame holds good of whatever object is presented to our mind.\nXII. How it happens that every one does not come equally to know\nthis.\nThose who have not philosophized in order have had other opinions on\nthis subject, because they never distinguished with sufficient care\nthe mind from the body. For, although they had no difficulty in\nbelieving that they themselves existed, and that they had a higher\nassurance of this than of any other thing, nevertheless, as they did\nnot observe that by THEMSELVES, they ought here to understand their\nMINDS alone [when the question related to metaphysical certainty];\nand since, on the contrary, they rather meant their bodies which\nthey saw with their eyes, touched with their hands, and to which\nthey erroneously attributed the faculty of perception, they were\nprevented from distinctly apprehending the nature of the mind.\nXIII. In what sense the knowledge of other things depends upon the\nknowledge of God.\nBut when the mind, which thus knows itself but is still in doubt as\nto all other things, looks around on all sides, with a view to the\nfarther extension of its knowledge, it first of all discovers within\nitself the ideas of many things; and while it simply contemplates\nthem, and neither affirms nor denies that there is anything beyond\nitself corresponding to them, it is in no danger of erring. The mind\nalso discovers certain common notions out of which it frames various\ndemonstrations that carry conviction to such a degree as to render\ndoubt of their truth impossible, so long as we give attention to\nthem. For example, the mind has within itself ideas of numbers and\nfigures, and it has likewise among its common notions the principle\nTHAT IF EQUALS BE ADDED TO EQUALS THE WHOLES WILL BE EQUAL and the\nlike; from which it is easy to demonstrate that the three angles of\na triangle are equal to two right angles, etc. Now, so long as we\nattend to the premises from which this conclusion and others similar\nto it were deduced, we feel assured of their truth; but, as the mind\ncannot always think of these with attention, when it has the\nremembrance of a conclusion without recollecting the order of its\ndeduction, and is uncertain whether the author of its being has\ncreated it of a nature that is liable to be deceived, even in what\nappears most evident, it perceives that there is just ground to\ndistrust the truth of such conclusions, and that it cannot possess\nany certain knowledge until it has discovered its author.\nXIV. That we may validly infer the existence of God from necessary\nexistence being comprised in the concept we have of him.\nWhen the mind afterwards reviews the different ideas that are in it,\nit discovers what is by far the chief among them--that of a Being\nomniscient, all-powerful, and absolutely perfect; and it observes\nthat in this idea there is contained not only possible and\ncontingent existence, as in the ideas of all other things which it\nclearly perceives, but existence absolutely necessary and eternal.\nAnd just as because, for example, the equality of its three angles\nto two right angles is necessarily comprised in the idea of a\ntriangle, the mind is firmly persuaded that the three angles of a\ntriangle are equal to two right angles; so, from its perceiving\nnecessary and eternal existence to be comprised in the idea which it\nhas of an all-perfect Being, it ought manifestly to conclude that\nthis all-perfect Being exists.\nXV. That necessary existence is not in the same way comprised in\nthe notions which we have of other things, but merely contingent\nexistence.\nThe mind will be still more certain of the truth of this conclusion,\nif it consider that it has no idea of any other thing in which it\ncan discover that necessary existence is contained; for, from this\ncircumstance alone, it will discern that the idea of an all-perfect\nBeing has not been framed by itself, and that it does not represent\na chimera, but a true and immutable nature, which must exist since\nit can only be conceived as necessarily existing.\nXVI. That prejudices hinder many from clearly knowing the necessity\nof the existence of God.\nOur mind would have no difficulty in assenting to this truth, if it\nwere, first of all, wholly free from prejudices; but as we have been\naccustomed to distinguish, in all other things, essence from\nexistence, and to imagine at will many ideas of things which neither\nare nor have been, it easily happens, when we do not steadily fix\nour thoughts on the contemplation of the all-perfect Being, that a\ndoubt arises as to whether the idea we have of him is not one of\nthose which we frame at pleasure, or at least of that class to whose\nessence existence does not pertain.\nXVII. That the greater objective (representative) perfection there\nis in our idea of a thing, the greater also must be the perfection\nof its cause.\nWhen we further reflect on the various ideas that are in us, it is\neasy to perceive that there is not much difference among them, when\nwe consider them simply as certain modes of thinking, but that they\nare widely different, considered in reference to the objects they\nrepresent; and that their causes must be so much the more perfect\naccording to the degree of objective perfection contained in them.\n[Footnote: \"as what they represent of their object has more\nperfection.\"--FRENCH.] For there is no difference between this and\nthe case of a person who has the idea of a machine, in the\nconstruction of which great skill is displayed, in which\ncircumstances we have a right to inquire how he came by this idea,\nwhether, for example, he somewhere saw such a machine constructed by\nanother, or whether he was so accurately taught the mechanical\nsciences, or is endowed with such force of genius, that he was able\nof himself to invent it, without having elsewhere seen anything like\nit; for all the ingenuity which is contained in the idea objectively\nonly, or as it were in a picture, must exist at least in its first\nand chief cause, whatever that may be, not only objectively or\nrepresentatively, but in truth formally or eminently.\nXVIII. That the existence of God may be again inferred from the\nabove.\nThus, because we discover in our minds the idea of God, or of an\nall-perfect Being, we have a right to inquire into the source whence\nwe derive it; and we will discover that the perfections it\nrepresents are so immense as to render it quite certain that we\ncould only derive it from an all-perfect Being; that is, from a God\nreally existing. For it is not only manifest by the natural light\nthat nothing cannot be the cause of anything whatever, and that the\nmore perfect cannot arise from the less perfect, so as to be thereby\nproduced as by its efficient and total cause, but also that it is\nimpossible we can have the idea or representation of anything\nwhatever, unless there be somewhere, either in us or out of us, an\noriginal which comprises, in reality, all the perfections that are\nthus represented to us; but, as we do not in any way find in\nourselves those absolute perfections of which we have the idea, we\nmust conclude that they exist in some nature different from ours,\nthat is, in God, or at least that they were once in him; and it most\nmanifestly follows [from their infinity] that they are still there.\nXIX. That, although we may not comprehend the nature of God, there\nis yet nothing which we know so clearly as his perfections.\nThis will appear sufficiently certain and manifest to those who have\nbeen accustomed to contemplate the idea of God, and to turn their\nthoughts to his infinite perfections; for, although we may not\ncomprehend them, because it is of the nature of the infinite not to\nbe comprehended by what is finite, we nevertheless conceive them\nmore clearly and distinctly than material objects, for this reason,\nthat, being simple, and unobscured by limits,[Footnote: After\nLIMITS, \"what of them we do conceive is much less confused. There\nis, besides, no speculation more calculated to aid in perfecting our\nunderstanding, and which is more important than this, inasmuch as\nthe consideration of an object that has no limits to its perfections\nfills us with satisfaction and assurance.\"-FRENCH.] they occupy our\nmind more fully.\nXX. That we are not the cause of ourselves, but that this is God,\nand consequently that there is a God.\nBut, because every one has not observed this, and because, when we\nhave an idea of any machine in which great skill is displayed, we\nusually know with sufficient accuracy the manner in which we\nobtained it, and as we cannot even recollect when the idea we have\nof a God was communicated to us by him, seeing it was always in our\nminds, it is still necessary that we should continue our review, and\nmake inquiry after our author, possessing, as we do, the idea of the\ninfinite perfections of a God: for it is in the highest degree\nevident by the natural light, that that which knows something more\nperfect than itself, is not the source of its own being, since it\nwould thus have given to itself all the perfections which it knows;\nand that, consequently, it could draw its origin from no other being\nthan from him who possesses in himself all those perfections, that\nis, from God.\nXXI. That the duration alone of our life is sufficient to\ndemonstrate the existence of God.\nThe truth of this demonstration will clearly appear, provided we\nconsider the nature of time, or the duration of things; for this is\nof such a kind that its parts are not mutually dependent, and never\nco-existent; and, accordingly, from the fact that we now are, it\ndoes not necessarily follow that we shall be a moment afterwards,\nunless some cause, viz., that which first produced us, shall, as it\nwere, continually reproduce us, that is, conserve us. For we easily\nunderstand that there is no power in us by which we can conserve\nourselves, and that the being who has so much power as to conserve\nus out of himself, must also by so much the greater reason conserve\nhimself, or rather stand in need of being conserved by no one\nwhatever, and, in fine, be God.\nXXII. That in knowing the existence of God, in the manner here\nexplained, we likewise know all his attributes, as far as they can\nbe known by the natural light alone.\nThere is the great advantage in proving the existence of God in this\nway, viz., by his idea, that we at the same time know what he is, as\nfar as the weakness of our nature allows; for, reflecting on the\nidea we have of him which is born with us, we perceive that he is\neternal, omniscient, omnipotent, the source of all goodness and\ntruth, creator of all things, and that, in fine, he has in himself\nall that in which we can clearly discover any infinite perfection or\ngood that is not limited by any imperfection.\nXXIII. That God is not corporeal, and does not perceive by means of\nsenses as we do, or will the evil of sin.\nFor there are indeed many things in the world that are to a certain\nextent imperfect or limited, though possessing also some perfection;\nand it is accordingly impossible that any such can be in God. Thus,\nlooking to corporeal nature,[Footnote: In the French, \"since\nextension constitutes the nature of body.\"] since divisibility is\nincluded in local extension, and this indicates imperfection, it is\ncertain that God is not body. And although in men it is to some\ndegree a perfection to be capable of perceiving by means of the\nsenses, nevertheless since in every sense there is passivity\n[Footnote: In the French, \"because our perceptions arise from\nimpressions made upon us from another source,\" i.e., than\nourselves.] which indicates dependency, we must conclude that God is\nin no manner possessed of senses, and that he only understands and\nwills, not, however, like us, by acts in any way distinct, but\nalways by an act that is one, identical, and the simplest possible,\nunderstands, wills, and operates all, that is, all things that in\nreality exist; for he does not will the evil of sin, seeing this is\nbut the negation of being.\nXXIV. That in passing from the knowledge of God to the knowledge of\nthe creatures, it is necessary to remember that our understanding is\nfinite, and the power of God infinite.\nBut as we know that God alone is the true cause of all that is or\ncan be, we will doubtless follow the best way of philosophizing, if,\nfrom the knowledge we have of God himself, we pass to the\nexplication of the things which he has created, and essay to deduce\nit from the notions that are naturally in our minds, for we will\nthus obtain the most perfect science, that is, the knowledge of\neffects through their causes. But that we may be able to make this\nattempt with sufficient security from error, we must use the\nprecaution to bear in mind as much as possible that God, who is the\nauthor of things, is infinite, while we are wholly finite.\nXXV. That we must believe all that God has revealed, although it\nmay surpass the reach of our faculties.\nThus, if perhaps God reveal to us or others, matters concerning\nhimself which surpass the natural powers of our mind, such as the\nmysteries of the incarnation and of the trinity, we will not refuse\nto believe them, although we may not clearly understand them; nor\nwill we be in any way surprised to find in the immensity of his\nnature, or even in what he has created, many things that exceed our\ncomprehension.\nXXVI. That it is not needful to enter into disputes [Footnote: \"to\nessay to comprehend the infinite.\"--FRENCH.] regarding the infinite,\nbut merely to hold all that in which we can find no limits as\nindefinite, such as the extension of the world, the divisibility of\nthe parts of matter, the number of the stars, etc.\nWe will thus never embarrass ourselves by disputes about the\ninfinite, seeing it would be absurd for us who are finite to\nundertake to determine anything regarding it, and thus as it were to\nlimit it by endeavouring to comprehend it. We will accordingly give\nourselves no concern to reply to those who demand whether the half\nof an infinite line is also infinite, and whether an infinite number\nis even or odd, and the like, because it is only such as imagine\ntheir minds to be infinite who seem bound to entertain questions of\nthis sort. And, for our part, looking to all those things in which\nin certain senses, we discover no limits, we will not, therefore,\naffirm that they are infinite, but will regard them simply as\nindefinite. Thus, because we cannot imagine extension so great that\nwe cannot still conceive greater, we will say that the magnitude of\npossible things is indefinite, and because a body cannot be divided\ninto parts so small that each of these may not be conceived as again\ndivided into others still smaller, let us regard quantity as\ndivisible into parts whose number is indefinite; and as we cannot\nimagine so many stars that it would seem impossible for God to\ncreate more, let us suppose that their number is indefinite, and so\nin other instances.\nXXVII. What difference there is between the indefinite and the\ninfinite.\nAnd we will call those things indefinite rather than infinite, with\nthe view of reserving to God alone the appellation of infinite; in\nthe first place, because not only do we discover in him alone no\nlimits on any side, but also because we positively conceive that he\nadmits of none; and in the second place, because we do not in the\nsame way positively conceive that other things are in every part\nunlimited, but merely negatively admit that their limits, if they\nhave any, cannot be discovered by us.\nXXVIII. That we must examine, not the final, but the efficient,\ncauses of created things.\nLikewise, finally, we will not seek reasons of natural things from\nthe end which God or nature proposed to himself in their creation\n(i. e., final causes), [Footnote: \"We will not stop to consider the\nends which God proposed to himself in the creation of the world, and\nwe will entirely reject from our philosophy the search of final\ncauses!\"--French.] for we ought not to presume so far as to think\nthat we are sharers in the counsels of Deity, but, considering him\nas the efficient cause of all things, let us endeavour to discover\nby the natural light [Footnote: \"Faculty of reasoning.\"--FRENCH.]\nwhich he has planted in us, applied to those of his attributes of\nwhich he has been willing we should have some knowledge, what must\nbe concluded regarding those effects we perceive by our senses;\nbearing in mind, however, what has been already said, that we must\nonly confide in this natural light so long as nothing contrary to\nits dictates is revealed by God himself. [Footnote: The last clause,\nbeginning \"bearing in mind.\" is omitted in the French.]\nXXIX. That God is not the cause of our errors.\nThe first attribute of God which here falls to be considered, is\nthat he is absolutely veracious and the source of all light, so that\nit is plainly repugnant for him to deceive us, or to be properly and\npositively the cause of the errors to which we are consciously\nsubject; for although the address to deceive seems to be some mark\nof subtlety of mind among men, yet without doubt the will to deceive\nonly proceeds from malice or from fear and weakness, and\nconsequently cannot be attributed to God.\nXXX. That consequently all which we clearly perceive is true, and\nthat we are thus delivered from the doubts above proposed.\nWhence it follows, that the light of nature, or faculty of knowledge\ngiven us by God, can never compass any object which is not true, in\nas far as it attains to a knowledge of it, that is, in as far as the\nobject is clearly and distinctly apprehended. For God would have\nmerited the appellation of a deceiver if he had given us this\nfaculty perverted, and such as might lead us to take falsity for\ntruth [when we used it aright]. Thus the highest doubt is removed,\nwhich arose from our ignorance on the point as to whether perhaps\nour nature was such that we might be deceived even in those things\nthat appear to us the most evident. The same principle ought also to\nbe of avail against all the other grounds of doubting that have been\nalready enumerated. For mathematical truths ought now to be above\nsuspicion, since these are of the clearest. And if we perceive\nanything by our senses, whether while awake or asleep, we will\neasily discover the truth provided we separate what there is of\nclear and distinct in the knowledge from what is obscure and\nconfused. There is no need that I should here say more on this\nsubject, since it has already received ample treatment in the\nmetaphysical Meditations; and what follows will serve to explain it\nstill more accurately.\nXXXI. That our errors are, in respect of God, merely negations,\nbut, in respect of ourselves, privations.\nBut as it happens that we frequently fall into error, although God\nis no deceiver, if we desire to inquire into the origin and cause of\nour errors, with a view to guard against them, it is necessary to\nobserve that they depend less on our understanding than on our will,\nand that they have no need of the actual concourse of God, in order\nto their production; so that, when considered in reference to God,\nthey are merely negations, but in reference to ourselves,\nprivations.\nXXXII. That there are only two modes of thinking in us, viz., the\nperception of the understanding and the action of the will.\nFor all the modes of thinking of which we are conscious may be\nreferred to two general classes, the one of which is the perception\nor operation of the understanding, and the other the volition or\noperation of the will. Thus, to perceive by the senses (SENTIRE), to\nimagine, and to conceive things purely intelligible, are only\ndifferent modes of perceiving (PERCIP IENDI); but to desire, to be\naverse from, to affirm, to deny, to doubt, are different modes of\nwilling.\nXXXIII. That we never err unless when we judge of something which\nwe do not sufficiently apprehend.\nWhen we apprehend anything we are in no danger of error, if we\nrefrain from judging of it in any way; and even when we have formed\na judgment regarding it, we would never fall into error, provided we\ngave our assent only to what we clearly and distinctly perceived;\nbut the reason why we are usually deceived, is that we judge without\npossessing an exact knowledge of that of which we judge.\nXXXIV. That the will as well as the understanding is required for\njudging.\nI admit that the understanding is necessary for judging, there being\nno room to suppose that we can judge of that which we in no way\napprehend; but the will also is required in order to our assenting\nto what we have in any degree perceived. It is not necessary,\nhowever, at least to form any judgment whatever, that we have an\nentire and perfect apprehension of a thing; for we may assent to\nmany things of which we have only a very obscure and confused\nknowledge.\nXXXV. That the will is of greater extension than the understanding,\nand is thus the source of our errors.\nFurther, the perception of the intellect extends only to the few\nthings that are presented to it, and is always very limited: the\nwill, on the other hand, may, in a certain sense, be said to be\ninfinite, because we observe nothing that can be the object of the\nwill of any other, even of the unlimited will of God, to which ours\ncannot also extend, so that we easily carry it beyond the objects we\nclearly perceive; and when we do this, it is not wonderful that we\nhappen to be deceived.\nXXXVI. That our errors cannot be imputed to God.\nBut although God has not given us an omniscient understanding, he is\nnot on this account to be considered in any wise the author of our\nerrors, for it is of the nature of created intellect to be finite,\nand of finite intellect not to embrace all things.\nXXXVII. That the chief perfection of man is his being able to act\nfreely or by will, and that it is this which renders him worthy of\npraise or blame.\nThat the will should be the more extensive is in harmony with its\nnature: and it is a high perfection in man to be able to act by\nmeans of it, that is, freely; and thus in a peculiar way to be the\nmaster of his own actions, and merit praise or blame. For self-\nacting machines are not commended because they perform with\nexactness all the movements for which they were adapted, seeing\ntheir motions are carried on necessarily; but the maker of them is\npraised on account of the exactness with which they were framed,\nbecause he did not act of necessity, but freely; and, on the same\nprinciple, we must attribute to ourselves something more on this\naccount, that when we embrace truth, we do so not of necessity, but\nfreely.\nXXXVIII. That error is a defect in our mode of acting, not in our\nnature; and that the faults of their subjects may be frequently\nattributed to other masters, but never to God.\nIt is true, that as often as we err, there is some defect in our\nmode of action or in the use of our liberty, but not in our nature,\nbecause this is always the same, whether our judgments be true or\nfalse. And although God could have given to us such perspicacity of\nintellect that we should never have erred, we have, notwithstanding,\nno right to demand this of him; for, although with us he who was\nable to prevent evil and did not is held guilty of it, God is not in\nthe same way to be reckoned responsible for our errors because he\nhad the power to prevent them, inasmuch as the dominion which some\nmen possess over others has been instituted for the purpose of\nenabling them to hinder those under them from doing evil, whereas\nthe dominion which God exercises over the universe is perfectly\nabsolute and free. For this reason we ought to thank him for the\ngoods he has given us, and not complain that he has not blessed us\nwith all which we know it was in his power to impart.\nXXXIX. That the liberty of our will is self-evident.\nFinally, it is so manifest that we possess a free will, capable of\ngiving or withholding its assent, that this truth must be reckoned\namong the first and most common notions which are born with us.\nThis, indeed, has already very clearly appeared, for when essaying\nto doubt of all things, we went so far as to suppose even that he\nwho created us employed his limitless power in deceiving us in every\nway, we were conscious nevertheless of being free to abstain from\nbelieving what was not in every respect certain and undoubted. But\nthat of which we are unable to doubt at such a time is as self-\nevident and clear as any thing we can ever know.\nXL. That it is likewise certain that God has fore-ordained all\nthings.\nBut because what we have already discovered of God, gives us the\nassurance that his power is so immense that we would sin in thinking\nourselves capable of ever doing anything which he had not ordained\nbeforehand, we should soon be embarrassed in great difficulties if\nwe undertook to harmonise the pre-ordination of God with the freedom\nof our will, and endeavoured to comprehend both truths at once.\nXLI. How the freedom of our will may be reconciled with the Divine\npre-ordination.\nBut, in place of this, we will be free from these embarrassments if\nwe recollect that our mind is limited, while the power of God, by\nwhich he not only knew from all eternity what is or can be, but also\nwilled and pre-ordained it, is infinite. It thus happens that we\npossess sufficient intelligence to know clearly and distinctly that\nthis power is in God, but not enough to comprehend how he leaves the\nfree actions of men indeterminate} and, on the other hand, we have\nsuch consciousness of the liberty and indifference which exists in\nourselves, that there is nothing we more clearly or perfectly\ncomprehend: [so that the omnipotence of God ought not to keep us\nfrom believing it]. For it would be absurd to doubt of that of which\nwe are fully conscious, and which we experience as existing in\nourselves, because we do not comprehend another matter which, from\nits very nature, we know to be incomprehensible.\nXLII. How, although we never will to err, it is nevertheless by our\nwill that we do err.\nBut now since we know that all our errors depend upon our will, and\nas no one wishes to deceive himself, it may seem wonderful that\nthere is any error in our judgments at all. It is necessary to\nremark, however, that there is a great difference between willing to\nbe deceived, and willing to yield assent to opinions in which it\nhappens that error is found. For though there is no one who\nexpressly wishes to fall into error, we will yet hardly find any one\nwho is not ready to assent to things in which, unknown to himself,\nerror lurks; and it even frequently happens that it is the desire\nitself of following after truth that leads those not fully aware of\nthe order in which it ought to be sought for, to pass judgment on\nmatters of which they have no adequate knowledge, and thus to fall\ninto error.\nXLIII. That we shall never err if we give our assent only to what\nwe clearly and distinctly perceive.\nBut it is certain we will never admit falsity for truth, so long as\nwe judge only of that which we clearly and distinctly perceive;\nbecause, as God is no deceiver, the faculty of knowledge which he\nhas given us cannot be fallacious, nor, for the same reason, the\nfaculty of will, when we do not extend it beyond the objects we\nclearly know. And even although this truth could not be established\nby reasoning, the minds of all have been so impressed by nature as\nspontaneously to assent to whatever is clearly perceived, and to\nexperience an impossibility to doubt of its truth.\nXLIV. That we uniformly judge improperly when we assent to what we\ndo not clearly perceive, although our judgment may chance to be\ntrue; and that it is frequently our memory which deceives us by\nleading us to believe that certain things were formerly sufficiently\nunderstood by us.\nIt is likewise certain that, when we approve of any reason which we\ndo not apprehend, we are either deceived, or, if we stumble on the\ntruth, it is only by chance, and thus we can never possess the\nassurance that we are not in error. I confess it seldom happens that\nwe judge of a thing when we have observed we do not apprehend it,\nbecause it is a dictate of the natural light never to judge of what\nwe do not know. But we most frequently err in this, that we presume\nupon a past knowledge of much to which we give our assent, as to\nsomething treasured up in the memory, and perfectly known to us;\nwhereas, in truth, we have no such knowledge.\nXLV. What constitutes clear and distinct perception.\nThere are indeed a great many persons who, through their whole\nlifetime, never perceive anything in a way necessary for judging of\nit properly; for the knowledge upon which we can establish a certain\nand indubitable judgment must be not only clear, but also, distinct.\nI call that clear which is present and manifest to the mind giving\nattention to it, just as we are said clearly to see objects when,\nbeing present to the eye looking on, they stimulate it with\nsufficient force. and it is disposed to regard them; but the\ndistinct is that which is so precise and different from all other\nobjects as to comprehend in itself only what is clear. [Footnote:\n\"what appears manifestly to him who considers it as he ought.\"--\nFRENCH.]\nXLVI. It is shown, from the example of pain, that a perception may\nbe clear without being distinct, but that it cannot be distinct\nunless it is clear.\nFor example, when any one feels intense pain, the knowledge which he\nhas of this pain is very clear, but it is not always distinct; for\nmen usually confound it with the obscure judgment they form\nregarding its nature, and think that there is in the suffering part\nsomething similar to the sensation of pain of which they are alone\nconscious. And thus perception may be clear without being distinct,\nbut it can never be distinct without likewise being clear.\nXLVII. That, to correct the prejudices of our early years, we must\nconsider what is clear in each of our simple [Footnote: \"first.\"--\nFRENCH.] notions.\nAnd, indeed, in our early years, the mind was so immersed in the\nbody, that, although it perceived many things with sufficient\nclearness, it yet knew nothing distinctly; and since even at that\ntime we exercised our judgment in many matters, numerous prejudices\nwere thus contracted, which, by the majority, are never afterwards\nlaid aside. But that we may now be in a position to get rid of\nthese, I will here briefly enumerate all the simple notions of which\nour thoughts are composed, and distinguish in each what is clear\nfrom what is obscure, or fitted to lead into error.\nXLVIII. That all the objects of our knowledge are to be regarded\neither (1) as things or the affections of things: or (2) as eternal\ntruths; with the enumeration of things.\nWhatever objects fall under our knowledge we consider either as\nthings or the affections of things,[Footnote: Things and the\naffections of things are (in the French) equivalent to \"what has\nsome (i.e., a REAL) existence,\" as opposed to the class of \"eternal\ntruths,\" which have merely an IDEAL existence.] or as eternal truths\npossessing no existence beyond our thought. Of the first class the\nmost general are substance, duration, order, number, and perhaps\nalso some others, which notions apply to all the kinds of things. I\ndo not, however, recognise more than two highest kinds (SUMMA\nGENERA) of things; the first of intellectual things, or such as have\nthe power of thinking, including mind or thinking substance and its\nproperties; the second, of material things, embracing extended\nsubstance, or body and its properties. Perception, volition, and all\nmodes as well of knowing as of willing, are related to thinking\nsubstance; on the other hand, to extended substance we refer\nmagnitude, or extension in length, breadth, and depth, figure,\nmotion, situation, divisibility of parts themselves, and the like.\nThere are, however, besides these, certain things of which we have\nan internal experience that ought not to be referred either to the\nmind of itself, or to the body alone, but to the close and intimate\nunion between them, as will hereafter be shown in its place. Of this\nclass are the appetites of hunger and thirst, etc., and also the\nemotions or passions of the mind which are not exclusively mental\naffections, as the emotions of anger, joy, sadness, love, etc.; and,\nfinally, all the sensations, as of pain, titillation, light and\ncolours, sounds, smells, tastes, heat, hardness, and the other\ntactile qualities.\nXLIX. That the eternal truths cannot be thus enumerated, but that\nthis is not necessary.\nWhat I have already enumerated we are to regard as things, or the\nqualities or modes of things. We now come to speak of eternal\ntruths. When we apprehend that it is impossible a thing can arise\nfrom nothing, this proposition, EX NIHILO NIHIL FIT, is not\nconsidered as somewhat existing, or as the mode of a thing, but as\nan eternal truth having its seat in our mind, and is called a common\nnotion or axiom. Of this class are the following:--It is impossible\nthe same thing can at once be and not be; what is done cannot be\nundone; he who thinks must exist while he thinks; and innumerable\nothers, the whole of which it is indeed difficult to enumerate, but\nthis is not necessary, since, if blinded by no prejudices, we cannot\nfail to know them when the occasion of thinking them occurs.\nL. That these truths are clearly perceived, but not equally by all\nmen, on account of prejudices.\nAnd, indeed, with regard to these common notions, it is not to be\ndoubted that they can be clearly and distinctly known, for otherwise\nthey would not merit this appellation: as, in truth, some of them\nare not, with respect to all men, equally deserving of the name,\nbecause they are not equally admitted by all: not, however, from\nthis reason, as I think, that the faculty of knowledge of one man\nextends farther than that of another, but rather because these\ncommon notions are opposed to the prejudices of some, who, on this\naccount, are not able readily to embrace them, even although others,\nwho are free from those prejudices, apprehend them with the greatest\nclearness.\nLI. What substance is, and that the term is not applicable to God\nand the creatures in the same sense.\nBut with regard to what we consider as things or the modes of\nthings, it is worth while to examine each of them by itself. By\nsubstance we can conceive nothing else than a thing which exists in\nsuch a way as to stand in need of nothing beyond itself in order to\nits existence. And, in truth, there can be conceived but one\nsubstance which is absolutely independent, and that is God. We\nperceive that all other things can exist only by help of the\nconcourse of God. And, accordingly, the term substance does not\napply to God and the creatures UNIVOCALLY, to adopt a term familiar\nin the schools; that is, no signification of this word can be\ndistinctly understood which is common to God and them.\nLII. That the term is applicable univocally to the mind and the\nbody, and how substance itself is known.\nCreated substances, however, whether corporeal or thinking, may be\nconceived under this common concept; for these are things which, in\norder to their existence, stand in need of nothing but the concourse\nof God. But yet substance cannot be first discovered merely from its\nbeing a thing which exists independently, for existence by itself is\nnot observed by us. We easily, however, discover substance itself\nfrom any attribute of it, by this common notion, that of nothing\nthere are no attributes, properties, or qualities: for, from\nperceiving that some attribute is present, we infer that some\nexisting thing or substance to which it may be attributed is also of\nnecessity present.\nLIII. That of every substance there is one principal attribute, as\nthinking of the mind, extension of the body.\nBut, although any attribute is sufficient to lead us to the\nknowledge of substance, there is, however, one principal property of\nevery substance, which constitutes its nature or essence, and upon\nwhich all the others depend. Thus, extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth, constitutes the nature of corporeal substance; and thought\nthe nature of thinking substance. For every other thing that can be\nattributed to body, presupposes extension, and is only some mode of\nan extended thing; as all the properties we discover in the mind are\nonly diverse modes of thinking. Thus, for example, we cannot\nconceive figure unless in something extended, nor motion unless in\nextended space, nor imagination, sensation, or will, unless in a\nthinking thing. But, on the other hand, we can conceive extension\nwithout figure or motion, and thought without imagination or\nsensation, and so of the others; as is clear to any one who attends\nto these matters.\nLIV. How we may have clear and distinct notions of the substance\nwhich thinks, of that which is corporeal, and of God.\nAnd thus we may easily have two clear and distinct notions or ideas,\nthe one of created substance, which thinks, the other of corporeal\nsubstance, provided we carefully distinguish all the attributes of\nthought from those of extension. We may also have a clear and\ndistinct idea of an uncreated and independent thinking substance,\nthat is, of God, provided we do not suppose that this idea\nadequately represents to us all that is in God, and do not mix up\nwith it anything fictitious, but attend simply to the characters\nthat are comprised in the notion we have of him, and which we\nclearly know to belong to the nature of an absolutely perfect Being.\nFor no one can deny that there is in us such an idea of God, without\ngroundlessly supposing that there is no knowledge of God at all in\nthe human mind.\nLV. How duration, order, and number may be also distinctly\nconceived.\nWe will also have most distinct conceptions of duration, order, and\nnumber, if, in place of mixing up with our notions of them that\nwhich properly belongs to the concept of substance, we merely think\nthat the duration of a thing is a mode under which we conceive this\nthing, in so far as it continues to exist; and, in like manner, that\norder and number are not in reality different from things disposed\nin order and numbered, but only modes under which we diversely\nconsider these things.\nLVI. What are modes, qualities, attributes.\nAnd, indeed, we here understand by modes the same with what we\nelsewhere designate attributes or qualities. But when we consider\nsubstance as affected or varied by them, we use the term modes; when\nfrom this variation it may be denominated of such a kind, we adopt\nthe term qualities [to designate the different modes which cause it\nto be so named]; and, finally, when we simply regard these modes as\nin the substance, we call them attributes. Accordingly, since God\nmust be conceived as superior to change, it is not proper to say\nthat there are modes or qualities in him, but simply attributes; and\neven in created things that which is found in them always in the\nsame mode, as existence and duration in the thing which exists and\nendures, ought to be called attribute and not mode or quality.\nLVII. That some attributes exist in the things to which they are\nattributed, and others only in our thought; and what duration and\ntime are.\nOf these attributes or modes there are some which exist in the\nthings themselves, and others that have only an existence in our\nthought; thus, for example, time, which we distinguish from duration\ntaken in its generality, and call the measure of motion, is only a\ncertain mode under which we think duration itself, for we do not\nindeed conceive the duration of things that are moved to be\ndifferent from the duration of things that are not moved: as is\nevident from this, that if two bodies are in motion for an hour, the\none moving quickly and the other slowly, we do not reckon more time\nin the one than in the other, although there may be much more motion\nin the one of the bodies than in the other. But that we may\ncomprehend the duration of all things under a common measure, we\ncompare their duration with that of the greatest and most regular\nmotions that give rise to years and days, and which we call time;\nhence what is so designated is nothing superadded to duration, taken\nin its generality, but a mode of thinking.\nLVIII. That number and all universals are only modes of thought.\nIn the same way number, when it is not considered as in created\nthings, but merely in the abstract or in general, is only a mode of\nthinking; and the same is true of all those general ideas we call\nuniversals.\nLIX. How universals are formed; and what are the five common, viz.,\ngenus, species, difference, property, and accident.\nUniversals arise merely from our making use of one and the same idea\nin thinking of all individual objects between which there subsists a\ncertain likeness; and when we comprehend all the objects represented\nby this idea under one name, this term likewise becomes universal.\nFor example, when we see two stones, and do not regard their nature\nfarther than to remark that there are two of them, we form the idea\nof a certain number, which we call the binary; and when we\nafterwards see two birds or two trees, and merely take notice of\nthem so far as to observe that there are two of them, we again take\nup the same idea as before, which is, accordingly, universal; and we\nlikewise give to this number the same universal appellation of\nbinary. In the same way, when we consider a figure of three sides,\nwe form a certain idea, which we call the idea of a triangle, and we\nafterwards make use of it as the universal to represent to our mind\nall other figures of three sides. But when we remark more\nparticularly that of figures of three sides, some have a right angle\nand others not, we form the universal idea of a right-angled\ntriangle, which being related to the preceding as more general, may\nbe called species; and the right angle the universal difference by\nwhich right-angled triangles are distinguished from all others; and\nfarther, because the square of the side which sustains the right\nangle is equal to the squares of the other two sides, and because\nthis property belongs only to this species of triangles, we may call\nit the universal property of the species. Finally, if we suppose\nthat of these triangles some are moved and others not, this will be\ntheir universal accident; and, accordingly, we commonly reckon five\nuniversals, viz., genus, species, difference, property, accident.\nLX. Of distinctions; and first of the real.\nBut number in things themselves arises from the distinction there is\nbetween them: and distinction is threefold, viz., real, modal, and\nof reason. The real properly subsists between two or more\nsubstances; and it is sufficient to assure us that two substances\nare really mutually distinct, if only we are able clearly and\ndistinctly to conceive the one of them without the other. For the\nknowledge we have of God renders it certain that he can effect all\nthat of which we have a distinct idea: wherefore, since we have now,\nfor example, the idea of an extended and corporeal substance, though\nwe as yet do not know with certainty whether any such thing is\nreally existent, nevertheless, merely because we have the idea of\nit, we may be assured that such may exist; and, if it really exists,\nthat every part which we can determine by thought must be really\ndistinct from the other parts of the same substance. In the same\nway, since every one is conscious that he thinks, and that he in\nthought can exclude from himself every other substance, whether\nthinking or extended, it is certain that each of us thus considered\nis really distinct from every other thinking and corporeal\nsubstance. And although we suppose that God united a body to a soul\nso closely that it was impossible to form a more intimate union, and\nthus made a composite whole, the two substances would remain really\ndistinct, notwithstanding this union; for with whatever tie God\nconnected them, he was not able to rid himself of the power he\npossessed of separating them, or of conserving the one apart from\nthe other, and the things which God can separate or conserve\nseparately are really distinct.\nLXI. Of the modal distinction.\nThere are two kinds of modal distinctions, viz., that between the\nmode properly so-called and the substance of which it is a mode, and\nthat between two modes of the same substance. Of the former we have\nan example in this, that we can clearly apprehend substance apart\nfrom the mode which we say differs from it; while, on the other\nhand, we cannot conceive this mode without conceiving the substance\nitself. There is, for example, a modal distinction between figure or\nmotion and corporeal substance in which both exist; there is a\nsimilar distinction between affirmation or recollection and the\nmind. Of the latter kind we have an illustration in our ability to\nrecognise the one of two modes apart from the other, as figure apart\nfrom motion, and motion apart from figure; though we cannot think of\neither the one or the other without thinking of the common substance\nin which they adhere. If, for example, a stone is moved, and is\nwithal square, we can, indeed, conceive its square figure without\nits motion, and reciprocally its motion without its square figure;\nbut we can conceive neither this motion nor this figure apart from\nthe substance of the stone. As for the distinction according to\nwhich the mode of one substance is different from another substance,\nor from the mode of another substance, as the motion of one body is\ndifferent from another body or from the mind, or as motion is\ndifferent from doubt, it seems to me that it should be called real\nrather than modal, because these modes cannot be clearly conceived\napart from the really distinct substances of which they are the\nmodes.\nLXII. Of the distinction of reason (logical distinction).\nFinally, the distinction of reason is that between a substance and\nsome one of its attributes, without which it is impossible, however,\nwe can have a distinct conception of the substance itself; or\nbetween two such attributes of a common substance, the one of which\nwe essay to think without the other. This distinction is manifest\nfrom our inability to form a clear and distinct idea of such\nsubstance, if we separate from it such attribute; or to have a clear\nperception of the one of two such attributes if we separate it from\nthe other. For example, because any substance which ceases to endure\nceases also to exist, duration is not distinct from substance except\nin thought (RATIONE); and in general all the modes of thinking which\nwe consider as in objects differ only in thought, as well from the\nobjects of which they are thought as from each other in a common\nobject.[Footnote: \"and generally all the attributes that lead us to\nentertain different thoughts of the same thing, such as, for\nexample, the extension of body and its property of divisibility, do\nnot differ from the body which is to us the object of them, or from\neach other, unless as we sometimes confusedly think the one without\nthinking the other.\"--FRENCH.] It occurs, indeed, to me that I have\nelsewhere classed this kind of distinction with the modal (viz.,\ntowards the end of the Reply to the First Objections to the\nMeditations on the First Philosophy); but there it was only\nnecessary to treat of these distinctions generally, and it was\nsufficient for my purpose at that time simply to distinguish both of\nthem from the real.\nLXIII. How thought and extension may be distinctly known, as\nconstituting, the one the nature of mind, the other that of body.\nThought and extension may be regarded as constituting the natures of\nintelligent and corporeal substance; and then they must not be\notherwise conceived than as the thinking and extended substances\nthemselves, that is, as mind and body, which in this way are\nconceived with the greatest clearness and distinctness. Moreover, we\nmore easily conceive extended or thinking substance than substance\nby itself, or with the omission of its thinking or extension. For\nthere is some difficulty in abstracting the notion of substance from\nthe notions of thinking and extension, which, in truth, are only\ndiverse in thought itself (i.e., logically different); and a concept\nis not more distinct because it comprehends fewer properties, but\nbecause we accurately distinguish what is comprehended in it from\nall other notions.\nLXIV. How these may likewise be distinctly conceived as modes of\nsubstance.\nThought and extension may be also considered as modes of substance;\nin as far, namely, as the same mind may have many different\nthoughts, and the same body, with its size unchanged, may be\nextended in several diverse ways, at one time more in length and\nless in breadth or depth, and at another time more in breadth and\nless in length; and then they are modally distinguished from\nsubstance, and can be conceived not less clearly and distinctly,\nprovided they be not regarded as substances or things separated from\nothers, but simply as modes of things. For by regarding them as in\nthe substances of which they are the modes, we distinguish them from\nthese substances, and take them for what in truth they are: whereas,\non the other hand, if we wish to consider them apart from the\nsubstances in which they are, we should by this itself regard them\nas self-subsisting things, and thus confound the ideas of mode and\nsubstance.\nLXV. How we may likewise know their modes.\nIn the same way we will best apprehend the diverse modes of thought,\nas intellection, imagination, recollection, volition, etc., and also\nthe diverse modes of extension, or those that belong to extension,\nas all figures, the situation of parts and their motions, provided\nwe consider them simply as modes of the things in which they are;\nand motion as far as it is concerned, provided we think merely of\nlocomotion, without seeking to know the force that produces it, and\nwhich nevertheless I will essay to explain in its own place.\nLXVI. How our sensations, affections, and appetites may be clearly\nknown, although we are frequently wrong in our judgments regarding\nthem.\nThere remain our sensations, affections, and appetites, of which we\nmay also have a clear knowledge, if we take care to comprehend in\nthe judgments we form of them only that which is precisely contained\nin our perception of them, and of which we are immediately\nconscious. There is, however, great difficulty in observing this, at\nleast in respect of sensations; because we have all, without\nexception, from our youth judged that all the things we perceived by\nour senses had an existence beyond our thought, and that they were\nentirely similar to the sensations, that is, perceptions, we had of\nthem. Thus when, for example, we saw a certain colour, we thought we\nsaw something occupying a place out of us, and which was entirely\nsimilar to that idea of colour we were then conscious of; and from\nthe habit of judging in this way, we seemed to see this so clearly\nand distinctly that we esteemed it (i.e., the externality of the\ncolour) certain and indubitable.\nLXVII. That we are frequently deceived in our judgments regarding\npain itself.\nThe same prejudice has place in all our other sensations, even in\nthose of titillation and pain. For though we are not in the habit of\nbelieving that there exist out of us objects that resemble\ntitillation and pain, we do not nevertheless consider these\nsensations as in the mind alone, or in our perception, but as in the\nhand, or foot, or some other part of our body. There is no reason,\nhowever, to constrain us to believe that the pain, for example,\nwhich we feel, as it were, in the foot is something out of the mind\nexisting in the foot, or that the light which we see, as it were, in\nthe sun exists in the sun as it is in us. Both these beliefs are\nprejudices of our early years, as will clearly appear in the sequel.\nLXVIII. How in these things what we clearly conceive is to be\ndistinguished from that in which we may be deceived.\nBut that we may distinguish what is clear in our sensations from\nwhat is obscure, we ought most carefully to observe that we possess\na clear and distinct knowledge of pain, colour, and other things of\nthis sort, when we consider them simply as sensations or thoughts;\nbut that, when they are judged to be certain things subsisting\nbeyond our mind, we are wholly unable to form any conception of\nthem. Indeed, when any one tells us that he sees colour in a body or\nfeels pain in one of his limbs, this is exactly the same as if he\nsaid that he there saw or felt something of the nature of which he\nwas entirely ignorant, or that he did not know what he saw or felt.\nFor although, when less attentively examining his thoughts, a person\nmay easily persuade himself that he has some knowledge of it, since\nhe supposes that there is something resembling that sensation of\ncolour or of pain of which he is conscious; yet, if he reflects on\nwhat the sensation of colour or pain represents to him as existing\nin a coloured body or in a wounded member, he will find that of such\nhe has absolutely no knowledge.\nLXIX. That magnitude, figure, etc., are known far differently from\ncolour, pain, etc.\nWhat we have said above will be more manifest; especially if we\nconsider that size in the body perceived, figure, motion (at least\nlocal, for philosophers by fancying other kinds of motion have\nrendered its nature less intelligible to themselves), the situation\nof parts, duration, number, and those other properties which, as we\nhave already said, we clearly perceive in all bodies, are known by\nus in a way altogether different from that in which we know what\ncolour is in the same body, or pain, smell, taste, or any other of\nthose properties which I have said above must be referred to the\nsenses. For although when we see a body we are not less assured of\nits existence from its appearing figured than from its appearing\ncoloured,[Footnote: \"by the colour we perceive on occasion of it.\"--\nFRENCH.] we yet know with far greater clearness its property of\nfigure than its colour.\nLXX. That we may judge of sensible things in two ways, by the one\nof which we avoid error, by the other fall into it.\nIt is thus manifest that to say we perceive colours in objects is in\nreality equivalent to saying we perceive something in objects and\nare yet ignorant of what it is, except as that which determines in\nus a certain highly vivid and clear sensation, which we call the\nsensation of colours. There is, however, very great diversity in the\nmanner of judging: for so long as we simply judge that there is an\nunknown something in objects (that is, in things such as they are,\nfrom which the sensation reached us), so far are we from falling\ninto error that, on the contrary, we thus rather provide against it,\nfor we are less apt to judge rashly of a thing which we observe we\ndo not know. But when we think we perceive colours in objects,\nalthough we are in reality ignorant of what we then denominate\ncolour, and are unable to conceive any resemblance between the\ncolour we suppose to be in objects, and that of which we are\nconscious in sensation, yet because we do not observe this, or\nbecause there are in objects several properties, as size, figure,\nnumber, etc., which, as we clearly know, exist, or may exist in them\nas they are perceived by our senses or conceived by our\nunderstanding, we easily glide into the error of holding that what\nis called colour in objects is something entirely resembling the\ncolour we perceive, and thereafter of supposing that we have a clear\nperception of what is in no way perceived by us.\nLXXI. That the chief cause of our errors is to be found in the\nprejudices of our childhood.\nAnd here we may notice the first and chief cause of our errors. In\nearly life the mind was so closely bound to the body that it\nattended to nothing beyond the thoughts by which it perceived the\nobjects that made impression on the body; nor as yet did it refer\nthese thoughts to anything existing beyond itself, but simply felt\npain when the body was hurt, or pleasure when anything beneficial to\nthe body occurred, or if the body was so highly affected that it was\nneither greatly benefited nor hurt, the mind experienced the\nsensations we call tastes, smells, sounds, heat, cold, light,\ncolours, and the like, which in truth are representative of nothing\nexisting out of our mind, and which vary according to the\ndiversities of the parts and modes in which the body is affected.\n[Footnote: \"which vary according to the diversities of the movements\nthat pass from all parts of our body to the part of the brain to\nwhich it (the mind) is closely joined and united.\"--FRENCH.] The\nmind at the same time also perceived magnitudes, figures, motions,\nand the like, which were not presented to it as sensations but as\nthings or the modes of things existing, or at least capable of\nexisting out of thought, although it did not yet observe this\ndifference between these two kinds of perceptions. And afterwards\nwhen the machine of the body, which has been so fabricated by nature\nthat it can of its own inherent power move itself in various ways,\nby turning itself at random on every side, followed after what was\nuseful and avoided what was detrimental; the mind, which was closely\nconnected with it, reflecting on the objects it pursued or avoided,\nremarked, for the first time, that they existed out of itself, and\nnot only attributed to them magnitudes, figures, motions, and the\nlike, which it apprehended either as things or as the modes of\nthings, but, in addition, attributed to them tastes, odours, and the\nother ideas of that sort, the sensations of which were caused by\nitself; [Footnote: \"which it perceived on occasion of them\" (i.e.,\nof external objects).--FRENCH.] and as it only considered other\nobjects in so far as they were useful to the body, in which it was\nimmersed, it judged that there was greater or less reality in each\nobject, according as the impressions it caused on the body were more\nor less powerful. Hence arose the belief that there was more\nsubstance or body in rocks and metals than in air or water, because\nthe mind perceived in them more hardness and weight. Moreover, the\nair was thought to be merely nothing so long as we experienced no\nagitation of it by the wind, or did not feel it hot or cold. And\nbecause the stars gave hardly more light than the slender flames of\ncandles, we supposed that each star was but of this size. Again,\nsince the mind did not observe that the earth moved on its axis, or\nthat its superficies was curved like that of a globe, it was on that\naccount more ready to judge the earth immovable and its surface\nflat. And our mind has been imbued from our infancy with a thousand\nother prejudices of the same sort which afterwards in our youth we\nforgot we had accepted without sufficient examination, and admitted\nas possessed of the highest truth and clearness, as if they had been\nknown by means of our senses, or implanted in us by nature.\nLXXII. That the second cause of our errors is that we cannot forget\nthese prejudices.\nAnd although now in our mature years, when the mind, being no longer\nwholly subject to the body, is not in the habit of referring all\nthings to it, but also seeks to discover the truth of things\nconsidered in themselves, we observe the falsehood of a great many\nof the judgments we had before formed; yet we experience a\ndifficulty in expunging them from our memory, and, so long as they\nremain there, they give rise to various errors. Thus, for example,\nsince from our earliest years we imagined the stars to be of very\nsmall size, we find it highly difficult to rid ourselves of this\nimagination, although assured by plain astronomical reasons that\nthey are of the greatest,--so prevailing is the power of\npreconceived opinion.\nLXXIII. The third cause is, that we become fatigued by attending to\nthose objects which are not present to the senses; and that we are\nthus accustomed to judge of these not from present perception but\nfrom pre-conceived opinion.\nBesides, our mind cannot attend to any object without at length\nexperiencing some pain and fatigue; and of all objects it has the\ngreatest difficulty in attending to those which are present neither\nto the senses nor to the imagination: whether for the reason that\nthis is natural to it from its union with the body, or because in\nour early years, being occupied merely with perceptions and\nimaginations, it has become more familiar with, and acquired greater\nfacility in thinking in those modes than in any other. Hence it also\nhappens that many are unable to conceive any substance except what\nis imaginable and corporeal, and even sensible. For they are\nignorant of the circumstance, that those objects alone are\nimaginable which consist in extension, motion, and figure, while\nthere are many others besides these that are intelligible; and they\npersuade themselves that nothing can subsist but body, and, finally,\nthat there is no body which is not sensible. And since in truth we\nperceive no object such as it is by sense alone [but only by our\nreason exercised upon sensible objects], as will hereafter be\nclearly shown, it thus happens that the majority during life\nperceive nothing unless in a confused way.\nLXXIV. The fourth source of our errors is, that we attach our\nthoughts to words which do not express them with accuracy.\nFinally, since for the use of speech we attach all our conceptions\nto words by which to express them, and commit to memory our thoughts\nin connection with these terms, and as we afterwards find it more\neasy to recall the words than the things signified by them, we can\nscarcely conceive anything with such distinctness as to separate\nentirely what we conceive from the words that were selected to\nexpress it. On this account the majority attend to words rather than\nto things; and thus very frequently assent to terms without\nattaching to them any meaning, either because they think they once\nunderstood them, or imagine they received them from others by whom\nthey were correctly understood. This, however, is not the place to\ntreat of this matter in detail, seeing the nature of the human body\nhas not yet been expounded, nor the existence even of body\nestablished; enough, nevertheless, appears to have been said to\nenable one to distinguish such of our conceptions as are clear and\ndistinct from those that are obscure and confused.\nLXXV. Summary of what must be observed in order to philosophize\ncorrectly.\nWherefore if we would philosophize in earnest, and give ourselves to\nthe search after all the truths we are capable of knowing, we must,\nin the first place, lay aside our prejudices; in other words, we\nmust take care scrupulously to withhold our assent from the opinions\nwe have formerly admitted, until upon new examination we discover\nthat they are true. We must, in the next place, make an orderly\nreview of the notions we have in our minds, and hold as true all and\nonly those which we will clearly and distinctly apprehend. In this\nway we will observe, first of all, that we exist in so far as it is\nour nature to think, and at the same time that there is a God upon\nwhom we depend; and after considering his attributes we will be able\nto investigate the truth of all other things, since God is the cause\nof them. Besides the notions we have of God and of our mind, we will\nlikewise find that we possess the knowledge of many propositions\nwhich are eternally true, as, for example, that nothing cannot be\nthe cause of anything, etc. We will farther discover in our minds\nthe knowledge of a corporeal or extended nature that may be moved,\ndivided, etc., and also of certain sensations that affect us, as of\npain, colours, tastes, etc., although we do not yet know the cause\nof our being so affected; and, comparing what we have now learne'd,\nby examining those things in their order, with our former confused\nknowledge of them, we will acquire the habit of forming clear and\ndistinct conceptions of all the objects we are capable of knowing.\nIn these few precepts seem to me to be comprised the most general\nand important principles of human knowledge.\nLXXVI. That we ought to prefer the Divine authority to our\nperception; [Footnote: \"reasonings.\"--FRENCH]. but that, apart from\nthings revealed, we ought to assent to nothing that we do not\nclearly apprehend.\nAbove all, we must impress on our memory the infallible rule, that\nwhat God has revealed is incomparably more certain than anything\nelse; and that, we ought to submit our belief to the Divine\nauthority rather than to our own judgment, even although perhaps the\nlight of reason should, with the greatest clearness and evidence,\nappear to suggest to us something contrary to what is revealed. But\nin things regarding which there is no revelation, it is by no means\nconsistent with the character of a philosopher to accept as true\nwhat he has not ascertained to be such, and to trust more to the\nsenses, in other words, to the inconsiderate judgments of childhood\nthan to the dictates of mature reason.\nPART II.\nOF THE PRINCIPLES OF MATERIAL THINGS.\nI. The grounds on which the existence of material things may be\nknown with certainty.\nAlthough we are all sufficiently persuaded of the existence of\nmaterial things, yet, since this was before called in question by\nus, and since we reckoned the persuasion of their existence as among\nthe prejudices of our childhood, it is now necessary for us to\ninvestigate the grounds on which this truth may be known with\ncertainty. In the first place, then, it cannot be doubted that every\nperception we have comes to us from some object different from our\nmind; for it is not in our power to cause ourselves to experience\none perception rather than another, the perception being entirely\ndependent on the object which affects our senses. It may, indeed, be\nmatter of inquiry whether that object be God, or something different\nfrom God; but because we perceive, or rather, stimulated by sense,\nclearly and distinctly apprehend, certain matter extended in length,\nbreadth, and thickness, the various parts of which have different\nfigures and motions, and give rise to the sensation we have of\ncolours, smells, pain, etc., God would, without question, deserve to\nbe regarded as a deceiver, if he directly and of himself presented\nto our mind the idea of this extended matter, or merely caused it to\nbe presented to us by some object which possessed neither extension,\nfigure, nor motion. For we clearly conceive this matter as entirely\ndistinct from God, and from ourselves, or our mind; and appear even\nclearly to discern that the idea of it is formed in us on occasion\nof objects existing out of our minds, to which it is in every\nrespect similar. But since God cannot deceive us, for this is\nrepugnant to his nature, as has been already remarked, we must\nunhesitatingly conclude that there exists a certain object extended\nin length, breadth, and thickness, and possessing all those\nproperties which we clearly apprehend to belong to what is extended.\nAnd this extended substance is what we call body or matter.\nII. How we likewise know that the human body is closely connected\nwith the mind.\nWe ought also to conclude that a certain body is more closely united\nto our mind than any other, because we clearly observe that pain and\nother sensations affect us without our foreseeing them; and these,\nthe mind is conscious, do not arise from itself alone, nor pertain\nto it, in so far as it is a thing which thinks, but only in so far\nas it is united to another thing extended and movable, which is\ncalled the human body. But this is not the place to treat in detail\nof this matter.\nIII. That the perceptions of the senses do not teach us what is in\nreality in things, but what is beneficial of hurtful to the\ncomposite whole of mind and body.\nIt will be sufficient to remark that the perceptions of the senses\nare merely to be referred to this intimate union of the human body\nand mind, and that they usually make us aware of what, in external\nobjects, may be useful or adverse to this union, but do not present\nto us these objects as they are in themselves, unless occasionally\nand by accident. For, after this observation, we will without\ndifficulty lay aside the prejudices of the senses, and will have\nrecourse to our understanding alone on this question by reflecting\ncarefully on the ideas implanted in it by nature.\nIV. That the nature of body consists not in weight hardness, colour\nand the like, but in extension alone.\nIn this way we will discern that the nature of matter or body,\nconsidered in general, does not consist in its being hard, or\nponderous, or coloured, or that which affects our senses in any\nother way, but simply in its being a substance extended in length,\nbreadth, and depth. For with respect to hardness, we know nothing of\nit by sense farther than that the parts of hard bodies resist the\nmotion of our hands on coming into contact with them; but if every\ntime our hands moved towards any part, all the bodies in that place\nreceded as quickly as our hands approached, we should never feel\nhardness; and yet we have no reason to believe that bodies which\nmight thus recede would on this account lose that which makes them\nbodies. The nature of body does not, therefore, consist in hardness.\nIn the same way, it may be shown that weight, colour, and all the\nother qualities of this sort, which are perceived in corporeal\nmatter, may be taken from it, itself meanwhile remaining entire: it\nthus follows that the nature of body depends on none of these.\nV. That the truth regarding the nature of body is obscured by the\nopinions respecting rarefaction and a vacuum with which we are pre-\noccupied.\nThere still remain two causes to prevent its being fully admitted\nthat the true nature of body consists in extension alone. The first\nis the prevalent opinion, that most bodies admit of being so\nrarefied and condensed that, when rarefied, they have greater\nextension than when condensed; and some even have subtilized to such\na degree as to make a distinction between the substance of body and\nits quantity, and between quantity itself and extension. The second\ncause is this, that where we conceive only extension in length,\nbreadth, and depth, we are not in the habit of saying that body is\nthere, but only space and further void space, which the generality\nbelieve to be a mere negation.\nVI. In what way rarefaction takes place.\nBut with regard to rarefaction and condensation, whoever gives his\nattention to his own thoughts, and admits nothing of which he is not\nclearly conscious, will not suppose that there is anything in those\nprocesses further than a change of figure in the body rarefied or\ncondensed: so that, in other words, rare bodies are those between\nthe parts of which there are numerous distances filled with other\nbodies; and dense bodies, on the other hand, those whose parts\napproaching each other, either diminish these distances or take them\nwholly away, in the latter of which cases the body is rendered\nabsolutely dense. The body, however, when condensed, has not,\ntherefore, less extension than when the parts embrace a greater\nspace, owing to their removal from each other, and their dispersion\ninto branches. For we ought not to attribute to it the extension of\nthe pores or distances which its parts do not occupy when it is\nrarefied, but to the other bodies that fill these interstices; just\nas when we see a sponge full of water or any other liquid, we do not\nsuppose that each part of the sponge has on this account greater\nextension than when compressed and dry, but only that its pores are\nwider, and therefore that the body is diffused over a larger space.\nVII. That rarefaction cannot be intelligibly explained unless in\nthe way here proposed.\nAnd indeed I am unable to discover the force of the reasons which\nhave induced some to say that rarefaction is the result of the\naugmentation of the quantity of body, rather than to explain it on\nthe principle exemplified in the case of a sponge. For although when\nair or water is rarefied we do not see any of the pores that are\nrendered large, or the new body that is added to occupy them, it is\nyet less agreeable to reason to suppose something that is\nunintelligible for the purpose of giving a verbal and merely\napparent explanation of the rarefaction of bodies, than to conclude,\nbecause of their rarefaction, that there are pores or distances\nbetween the parts which are increased in size, and filled with some\nnew body. Nor ought we to refrain from assenting to this\nexplanation, because we perceive this new body by none of our\nsenses, for there is no reason which obliges us to believe that we\nshould perceive by our senses all the bodies in existence. And we\nsee that it is very easy to explain rarefaction in this manner, but\nimpossible in any other; for, in fine, there would be, as appears to\nme, a manifest contradiction in supposing that any body was\nincreased by a quantity or extension which it had not before,\nwithout the addition to it of a new extended substance, in other\nwords, of another body, because it is impossible to conceive any\naddition of extension or quantity to a thing without supposing the\naddition of a substance having quantity or extension, as will more\nclearly appear from what follows.\nVIII. That quantity and number differ only in thought (RATIONE)\nfrom that which has quantity and is numbered.\nFor quantity differs from extended substance, and number from what\nis numbered, not in reality but merely in our thought; so that, for\nexample, we may consider the whole nature of a corporeal substance\nwhich is comprised in a space of ten feet, although we do not attend\nto this measure of ten feet, for the obvious reason that the thing\nconceived is of the same nature in any part of that space as in the\nwhole; and, on the other hand, we can conceive the number ten, as\nalso a continuous quantity of ten feet, without thinking of this\ndeterminate substance, because the concept of the number ten is\nmanifestly the same whether we consider a number of ten feet or ten\nof anything else; and we can conceive a continuous quantity of ten\nfeet without thinking of this or that determinate substance,\nalthough we cannot conceive it without some extended substance of\nwhich it is the quantity. It is in reality, however, impossible that\nany, even the least part, of such quantity or extension, can be\ntaken away, without the retrenchment at the same time of as much of\nthe substance, nor, on the other hand, can we lessen the substance,\nwithout at the same time taking as much from the quantity or\nextension.\nIX. That corporeal substance, when distinguished from its quantity,\nis confusedly conceived as something incorporeal.\nAlthough perhaps some express themselves otherwise on this matter, I\nam nevertheless convinced that they do not think differently from\nwhat I have now said: for when they distinguish (corporeal)\nsubstance from extension or quantity, they either mean nothing by\nthe word (corporeal) substance, or they form in their minds merely a\nconfused idea of incorporeal substance, which they falsely attribute\nto corporeal, and leave to extension the true idea of this corporeal\nsubstance; which extension they call an accident, but with such\nimpropriety as to make it easy to discover that their words are not\nin harmony with their thoughts.\nX. What space or internal place is.\nSpace or internal place, and the corporeal substance which is\ncomprised in it, are not different in reality, but merely in the\nmode in which they are wont to be conceived by us. For, in truth,\nthe same extension in length, breadth, and depth, which constitutes\nspace, constitutes body; and the difference between them lies only\nin this, that in body we consider extension as particular, and\nconceive it to change with the body; whereas in space we attribute\nto extension a generic unity, so that after taking from a certain\nspace the body which occupied it, we do not suppose that we have at\nthe same time removed the extension of the space, because it appears\nto us that the same extension remains there so long as it is of the\nsame magnitude and figure, and preserves the same situation in\nrespect to certain bodies around it, by means of which we determine\nthis space.\nXI. How space is not in reality different from corporeal substance.\nAnd indeed it will be easy to discern that it is the same extension\nwhich constitutes the nature of body as of space, and that these two\nthings are mutually diverse only as the nature of the genus and\nspecies differs from that of the individual, provided we reflect on\nthe idea we have of any body, taking a stone for example, and reject\nall that is not essential to the nature of body. In the first place,\nthen, hardness may be rejected, because if the stone were liquefied\nor reduced to powder, it would no longer possess hardness, and yet\nwould not cease to be a body; colour also may be thrown out of\naccount, because we have frequently seen stones so transparent as to\nhave no colour; again, we may reject weight, because we have the\ncase of fire, which, though very light, is still a body; and,\nfinally, we may reject cold, heat, and all the other qualities of\nthis sort, either because they are not considered as in the stone,\nor because, with the change of these qualities, the stone is not\nsupposed to have lost the nature of body. After this examination we\nwill find that nothing remains in the idea of body, except that it\nis something extended in length, breadth, and depth; and this\nsomething is comprised in our idea of space, not only of that which\nis full of body, but even of what is called void space.\nXII. How space differs from body in our mode of conceiving it.\nThere is, however, some difference between them in the mode of\nconception; for if we remove a stone from the space or place in\nwhich it was, we conceive that its extension also is taken away,\nbecause we regard this as particular, and inseparable from the stone\nitself: but meanwhile we suppose that the same extension of place in\nwhich this stone was remains, although the place of the stone be\noccupied by wood, water, air, or by any other body, or be even\nsupposed vacant, because we now consider extension in general, and\nthink that the same is common to stones, wood, water, air, and other\nbodies, and even to a vacuum itself, if there is any such thing,\nprovided it be of the same magnitude and figure as before, and\npreserve the same situation among the external bodies which\ndetermine this space.\nXIII. What external place is.\nThe reason of which is, that the words place and space signify\nnothing really different from body which is said to be in place, but\nmerely designate its magnitude, figure, and situation among other\nbodies. For it is necessary, in order to determine this situation,\nto regard certain other bodies which we consider as immovable; and,\naccording as we look to different bodies, we may see that the same\nthing at the same time does and does not change place. For example,\nwhen a vessel is being carried out to sea, a person sitting at the\nstern may be said to remain always in one place, if we look to the\nparts of the vessel, since with respect to these he preserves the\nsame situation; and on the other hand, if regard be had to the\nneighbouring shores, the same person will seem to be perpetually\nchanging place, seeing he is constantly receding from one shore and\napproaching another. And besides, if we suppose that the earth\nmoves, and that it makes precisely as much way from west to east as\nthe vessel from east to west, we will again say that the person at\nthe stern does not change his place, because this place will be\ndetermined by certain immovable points which we imagine to be in the\nheavens. But if at length we are persuaded that there are no points\nreally immovable in the universe, as will hereafter be shown to be\nprobable, we will thence conclude that nothing has a permanent place\nunless in so far as it is fixed by our thought.\nXIV. Wherein place and space differ.\nThe terms place and space, however, differ in signification, because\nplace more expressly designates situation than magnitude or figure,\nwhile, on the other hand, we think of the latter when we speak of\nspace. For we frequently say that a thing succeeds to the place of\nanother, although it be not exactly of the same magnitude or figure;\nbut we do not therefore admit that it occupies the same space as the\nother; and when the situation is changed we say that the place also\nis changed, although there are the same magnitude and figure as\nbefore: so that when we say that a thing is in a particular place,\nwe mean merely that it is situated in a determinate way in respect\nof certain other objects; and when we add that it occupies such a\nspace or place, we understand besides that it is of such determinate\nmagnitude and figure as exactly to fill this space.\nXV. How external place is rightly taken for the superficies of the\nsurrounding body.\nAnd thus we never indeed distinguish space from extension in length,\nbreadth, and depth; we sometimes, however, consider place as in the\nthing placed, and at other times as out of it. Internal place indeed\ndiffers in no way from space; but external place may be taken for\nthe superficies that immediately surrounds the thing placed. It\nought to be remarked that by superficies we do not here understand\nany part of the surrounding body, but only the boundary between the\nsurrounding and surrounded bodies, which is nothing more than a\nmode; or at least that we speak of superficies in general which is\nno part of one body rather than another, but is always considered\nthe same, provided it retain the same magnitude and figure. For\nalthough the whole surrounding body with its superficies were\nchanged, it would not be supposed that the body which was surrounded\nby it had therefore changed its place, if it meanwhile preserved the\nsame situation with respect to the other bodies that are regarded as\nimmovable. Thus, if we suppose that a boat is carried in one\ndirection by the current of a stream, and impelled by the wind in\nthe opposite with an equal force, so that its situation with respect\nto the banks is not changed, we will readily admit that it remains\nin the same place, although the whole superficies which surrounds it\nis incessantly changing.\nXVI. That a vacuum or space in which there is absolutely no body is\nrepugnant to reason.\nWith regard to a vacuum, in the philosophical sense of the term,\nthat is, a space in which there is no substance, it is evident that\nsuch does not exist, seeing the extension of space or internal place\nis not different from that of body. For since from this alone, that\na body has extension in length, breadth, and depth, we have reason\nto conclude that it is a substance, it being absolutely\ncontradictory that nothing should possess extension, we ought to\nform a similar inference regarding the space which is supposed void,\nviz., that since there is extension in it there is necessarily also\nsubstance.\nXVII. That a vacuum in the ordinary use of the term does not\nexclude all body.\nAnd, in truth, by the term vacuum in its common use, we do not mean\na place or space in which there is absolutely nothing, but only a\nplace in which there is none of those things we presume ought to be\nthere. Thus, because a pitcher is made to hold water, it is said to\nbe empty when it is merely filled with air; or if there are no fish\nin a fish-pond, we say there is nothing in it, although it be full\nof water; thus a vessel is said to be empty, when, in place of the\nmerchandise which it was designed to carry, it is loaded with sand\nonly, to enable it to resist the violence of the wind; and, finally,\nit is in the same sense that we say space is void when it contains\nnothing sensible, although it contain created and self-subsisting\nmatter; for we are not in the habit of considering the bodies near\nus, unless in so far as they cause in our organs of sense,\nimpressions strong enough to enable us to perceive them. And if, in\nplace of keeping in mind what ought to be understood by these terms\na vacuum and nothing, we afterwards suppose that in the space we\ncalled a vacuum, there is not only no sensible object, but no object\nat all, we will fall into the same error as if, because a pitcher in\nwhich there is nothing but air, is, in common speech, said to be\nempty, we were therefore to judge that the air contained in it is\nnot a substance (RES SUBSISTENS).\nXVIII. How the prejudice of an absolute vacuum is to be corrected.\nWe have almost all fallen into this error from the earliest age,\nfor, observing that there is no necessary connection between a\nvessel and the body it contains, we thought that God at least could\ntake from a vessel the body which occupied it, without it being\nnecessary that any other should be put in the place of the one\nremoved. But that we may be able now to correct this false opinion,\nit is necessary to remark that there is in truth no connection\nbetween the vessel and the particular body which it contains, but\nthat there is an absolutely necessary connection between the concave\nfigure of the vessel and the extension considered generally which\nmust be comprised in this cavity; so that it is not more\ncontradictory to conceive a mountain without a valley than such a\ncavity without the extension it contains, or this extension apart\nfrom an extended substance, for, as we have often said, of nothing\nthere can be no extension. And accordingly, if it be asked what\nwould happen were God to remove from a vessel all the body contained\nin it, without permitting another body to occupy its place, the\nanswer must be that the sides of the vessel would thus come into\nproximity with each other. For two bodies must touch each other when\nthere is nothing between them, and it is manifestly contradictory\nfor two bodies to be apart, in other words, that there should be a\ndistance between them, and this distance yet be nothing; for all\ndistance is a mode of extension, and cannot therefore exist without\nan extended substance.\nXIX. That this confirms what was said of rarefaction.\nAfter we have thus remarked that the nature of corporeal substance\nconsists only in its being an extended thing, and that its extension\nis not different from that which we attribute to space, however\nempty, it is easy to discover the impossibility of any one of its\nparts in any way whatsoever occupying more space at one time than at\nanother, and thus of being otherwise rarefied than in the way\nexplained above; and it is easy to perceive also that there cannot\nbe more matter or body in a vessel when it is filled with lead or\ngold, or any other body however heavy and hard, than when it but\ncontains air and is supposed to be empty: for the quantity of the\nparts of which a body is composed does not depend on their weight or\nhardness, but only on the extension, which is always equal in the\nsame vase.\nXX. That from this the non-existence of atoms may likewise be\ndemonstrated.\nWe likewise discover that there cannot exist any atoms or parts of\nmatter that are of their own nature indivisible. For however small\nwe suppose these parts to be, yet because they are necessarily\nextended, we are always able in thought to divide any one of them\ninto two or more smaller parts, and may accordingly admit their\ndivisibility. For there is nothing we can divide in thought which we\ndo not thereby recognize to be divisible; and, therefore, were we to\njudge it indivisible our judgment would not be in harmony with the\nknowledge we have of the thing; and although we should even suppose\nthat God had reduced any particle of matter to a smallness so\nextreme that it did not admit of being further divided, it would\nnevertheless be improperly styled indivisible, for though God had\nrendered the particle so small that it was not in the power of any\ncreature to divide it, he could not however deprive himself of the\nability to do so, since it is absolutely impossible for him to\nlessen his own omnipotence, as was before observed. Wherefore,\nabsolutely speaking, the smallest extended particle is always\ndivisible, since it is such of its very nature.\nXXI. It is thus also demonstrated that the extension of the world\nis indefinite.\nWe further discover that this world or the whole (universitas) of\ncorporeal substance, is extended without limit, for wherever we fix\na limit, we still not only imagine beyond it spaces indefinitely\nextended, but perceive these to be truly imaginable, in other words,\nto be in reality such as we imagine them; so that they contain in\nthem corporeal substance indefinitely extended, for, as has been\nalready shown at length, the idea of extension which we conceive in\nany space whatever is plainly identical with the idea of corporeal\nsubstance.\nXXII. It also follows that the matter of the heavens and earth is\nthe same, and that there cannot be a plurality of worlds.\nAnd it may also be easily inferred from all this that the earth and\nheavens are made of the same matter; and that even although there\nwere an infinity of worlds, they would all be composed of this\nmatter; from which it follows that a plurality of worlds is\nimpossible, because we clearly conceive that the matter whose nature\nconsists only in its being an extended substance, already wholly\noccupies all the imaginable spaces where these other worlds could\nalone be, and we cannot find in ourselves the idea of any other\nmatter.\nXXIII. That all the variety of matter, or the diversity of its\nforms, depends on motion.\nThere is therefore but one kind of matter in the whole universe, and\nthis we know only by its being extended. All the properties we\ndistinctly perceive to belong to it are reducible to its capacity of\nbeing divided and moved according to its parts; and accordingly it\nis capable of all those affections which we perceive can arise from\nthe motion of its parts. For the partition of matter in thought\nmakes no change in it; but all variation of it, or diversity of\nform, depends on motion. The philosophers even seem universally to\nhave observed this, for they said that nature was the principle of\nmotion and rest, and by nature they understood that by which all\ncorporeal things become such as they are found in experience.\nXXIV. What motion is, taking the term in its common use.\nBut motion (viz., local, for I can conceive no other kind of motion,\nand therefore I do not think we ought to suppose there is any other\nin nature), in the ordinary sense of the term, is nothing more than\nthe action by which a body passes from one place to another. And\njust as we have remarked above that the same thing may be said to\nchange and not to change place at the same time, so also we may say\nthat the same thing is at the same time moved and not moved. Thus,\nfor example, a person seated in a vessel which is setting sail,\nthinks he is in motion if he look to the shore that he has left, and\nconsider it as fixed; but not if he regard the ship itself, among\nthe parts of which he preserves always the same situation. Moreover,\nbecause we are accustomed to suppose that there is no motion without\naction, and that in rest there is the cessation of action, the\nperson thus seated is more properly said to be at rest than in\nmotion, seeing he is not conscious of being in action.\nXXV. What motion is properly so called.\nBut if, instead of occupying ourselves with that which has no\nfoundation, unless in ordinary usage, we desire to know what ought\nto be understood by motion according to the truth of the thing, we\nmay say, in order to give it a determinate nature, that it is THE\nTRANSPORTING OF ONE PART OF MATTER OR OF ONE BODY FROM THE VICINITY\nOF THOSE BODIES THAT ARE IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH IT, OR WHICH WE\nREGARD AS AT REST, to the vicinity of other bodies. By a body as a\npart of matter, I understand all that which is transferred together,\nalthough it be perhaps composed of several parts, which in\nthemselves have other motions; and I say that it is the transporting\nand not the force or action which transports, with the view of\nshowing that motion is always in the movable thing, not in that\nwhich moves; for it seems to me that we are not accustomed to\ndistinguish these two things with sufficient accuracy. Farther, I\nunderstand that it is a mode of the movable thing, and not a\nsubstance, just as figure is a property of the thing figured, and\nrepose of that which is at rest.\nPART III.\nOF THE VISIBLE WORLD.\nI. That we cannot think too highly of the works of God.\nHaving now ascertained certain principles of material things, which\nwere sought, not by the prejudices of the senses, but by the light\nof reason, and which thus possess so great evidence that we cannot\ndoubt of their truth, it remains for us to consider whether from\nthese alone we can deduce the explication of all the phenomena of\nnature. We will commence with those phenomena that are of the\ngreatest generality, and upon which the others depend, as, for\nexample, with the general structure of this whole visible world. But\nin order to our philosophizing aright regarding this, two things are\nfirst of all to be observed. The first is, that we should ever bear\nin mind the infinity of the power and goodness of God, that we may\nnot fear falling into error by imagining his works to be too great,\nbeautiful, and perfect, but that we may, on the contrary, take care\nlest, by supposing limits to them of which we have no certain\nknowledge, we appear to think less highly than we ought of the power\nof God.\nII. That we ought to beware lest, in our presumption, we imagine\nthat the ends which God proposed to himself in the creation of the\nworld are understood by us.\nThe second is, that we should beware of presuming too highly of\nourselves, as it seems we should do if we supposed certain limits to\nthe world, without being assured of their existence either by\nnatural reasons or by divine revelation, as if the power of our\nthought extended beyond what God has in reality made; but likewise\nstill more if we persuaded ourselves that all things were created by\nGod for us only, or if we merely supposed that we could comprehend\nby the power of our intellect the ends which God proposed to himself\nin creating the universe.\nIII. In what sense it may be said that all things were created for\nthe sake of man.\nFor although, as far as regards morals, it may be a pious thought to\nbelieve that God made all things for us, seeing we may thus be\nincited to greater gratitude and love toward him; and although it is\neven in some sense true, because there is no created thing of which\nwe cannot make some use, if it be only that of exercising our mind\nin considering it, and honouring God on account of it, it is yet by\nno means probable that all things were created for us in this way\nthat God had no other end in their creation; and this supposition\nwould be plainly ridiculous and inept in physical reasoning, for we\ndo not doubt but that many things exist, or formerly existed and\nhave now ceased to be, which were never seen or known by man, and\nwere never of use to him.\nPART IV.\nOF THE EARTH.\nCLXXXVIII. Of what is to be borrowed from disquisitions on animals\nand man to advance the knowledge of material objects.\nI should add nothing farther to this the Fourth Part of the\nPrinciples of Philosophy, did I purpose carrying out my original\ndesign of writing a Fifth and Sixth Part, the one treating of things\npossessed of life, that is, animals and plants, and the other of\nman. But because I have not yet acquired sufficient knowledge of all\nthe matters of which I should desire to treat in these two last\nparts, and do not know whether I shall ever have sufficient leisure\nto finish them, I will here subjoin a few things regarding the\nobjects of our senses, that I may not, for the sake of the latter,\ndelay too long the publication of the former parts, or of what may\nbe desiderated in them, which I might have reserved for explanation\nin those others: for I have hitherto described this earth, and\ngenerally the whole visible world, as if it were merely a machine in\nwhich there was nothing at all to consider except the figures and\nmotions of its parts, whereas our senses present to us many other\nthings, for example colours, smells, sounds, and the like, of which,\nif I did not speak at all, it would be thought I had omitted the\nexplication of the majority of the objects that are in nature.\nCLXXXIX. What perception (SENSUS) is, and how we perceive.\nWe must know, therefore, that although the human soul is united to\nthe whole body, it has, nevertheless, its principal seat in the\nbrain, where alone it not only understands and imagines, but also\nperceives; and this by the medium of the nerves, which are extended\nlike threads from the brain to all the other members, with which\nthey are so connected that we can hardly touch any one of them\nwithout moving the extremities of some of the nerves spread over it;\nand this motion passes to the other extremities of those nerves\nwhich are collected in the brain round the seat of the soul,\n[Footnote: *** FOOTNOTE NOT VISIBLE IN PAGE IMAGE (#98, Text p 195)]\nas I have already explained with sufficient minuteness in the fourth\nchapter of the Dioptrics. But the movements which are thus excited\nin the brain by the nerves variously affect the soul or mind, which\nis intimately conjoined with the brain, according to the diversity\nof the motions themselves. And the diverse affections of the mind or\nthoughts that immediately arise from these motions, are called\nperceptions of the senses (SENSUUM PERCEPTIONES), or, as we commonly\nspeak, sensations (SENSUS).\nCXC. Of the distinction of the senses; and, first, of the internal,\nthat is, of the affections of the mind (passions), and the natural\nappetites.\nThe varieties of these sensations depend, firstly, on the diversity\nof the nerves themselves, and, secondly, of the movements that are\nmade in each nerve. We have not, however, as many different senses\nas there are nerves. We can distinguish but seven principal classes\nof nerves, of which two belong to the internal, and the other five\nto the external senses. The nerves which extend to the stomach, the\noesophagus, the fauces, and the other internal parts that are\nsubservient to our natural wants, constitute one of our internal\nsenses. This is called the natural appetite (APPETITUS NATURALIS).\nThe other internal sense, which embraces all the emotions\n(COMMOTIONES) of the mind or passions, and affections, as joy,\nsadness, love, hate, and the like, depends upon the nerves which\nextend to the heart and the parts about the heart, and are\nexceedingly small; for, by way of example, when the blood happens to\nbe pure and well tempered, so that it dilates in the heart more\nreadily and strongly than usual, this so enlarges and moves the\nsmall nerves scattered around the orifices, that there is thence a\ncorresponding movement in the brain, which affects the mind with a\ncertain natural feeling of joy; and as often as these same nerves\nare moved in the same way, although this is by other causes, they\nexcite in our mind the same feeling (sensus, sentiment). Thus, the\nimagination of the enjoyment of a good does not contain in itself\nthe feeling of joy, but it causes the animal spirits to pass from\nthe brain to the muscles in which these nerves are inserted; and\nthus dilating the orifices of the heart, it also causes these small\nnerves to move in the way appointed by nature to afford the\nsensation of joy. Thus, when we receive news, the mind first of all\njudges of it, and if the news be good, it rejoices with that\nintellectual joy (GAUDIUM INTELLECTUALE) which is independent of any\nemotion (COMMOTIO) of the body, and which the Stoics did not deny to\ntheir wise man [although they supposed him exempt from all passion].\nBut as soon as this joy passes from the understanding to the\nimagination, the spirits flow from the brain to the muscles that are\nabout the heart, and there excite the motion of the small nerves, by\nmeans of which another motion is caused in the brain, which affects\nthe mind with the sensation of animal joy (LAETITIA ANIMALIS). On\nthe same principle, when the blood is so thick that it flows but\nsparingly into the ventricles of the heart, and is not there\nsufficiently dilated, it excites in the same nerves a motion quite\ndifferent from the preceding, which, communicated to the brain,\ngives to the mind the sensation of sadness, although the mind itself\nis perhaps ignorant of the cause of its sadness. And all the other\ncauses which move these nerves in the same way may also give to the\nmind the same sensation. But the other movements of the same nerves\nproduce other effects, as the feelings of love, hate, fear, anger,\netc., as far as they are merely affections or passions of the mind;\nin other words, as far as they are confused thoughts which the mind\nhas not from itself alone, but from its being closely joined to the\nbody, from which it receives impressions; for there is the widest\ndifference between these passions and the distinct thoughts which we\nhave of what ought to be loved, or chosen, or shunned, etc.,\n[although these are often enough found together]. The natural\nappetites, as hunger, thirst, and the others, are likewise\nsensations excited in the mind by means of the nerves of the\nstomach, fauces, and other parts, and are entirely different from\nthe will which we have to eat, drink, [and to do all that which we\nthink proper for the conservation of our body]; but, because this\nwill or appetition almost always accompanies them, they are\ntherefore named appetites.\nCXCI. Of the external senses; and first of touch.\nWe commonly reckon the external senses five in number, because there\nare as many different kinds of objects which move the nerves and\ntheir organs, and an equal number of kinds of confused thoughts\nexcited in the soul by these emotions. In the first place, the\nnerves terminating in the skin of the whole body can be touched\nthrough this medium by any terrene objects whatever, and moved by\nthese wholes, in one way by their hardness, in another by their\ngravity, in a third by their heat, in a fourth by their humidity,\netc.--and in as many diverse modes as they are either moved or\nhindered from their ordinary motion, to that extent are diverse\nsensations excited in the mind, from which a corresponding number of\ntactile qualities derive their appellations. Besides this, when\nthese nerves are moved a little more powerfully than usual, but not\nnevertheless to the degree by which our body is in any way hurt,\nthere thus arises a sensation of titillation, which is naturally\nagreeable to the mind, because it testifies to it of the powers of\nthe body with which it is joined, [in that the latter can suffer the\naction causing this titillation, without being hurt]. But if this\naction be strong enough to hurt our body in any way, this gives to\nour mind the sensation of pain. And we thus see why corporeal\npleasure and pain, although sensations of quite an opposite\ncharacter, arise nevertheless from causes nearly alike.\nCXCII. Of taste.\nIn the second place, the other nerves scattered over the tongue and\nthe parts in its vicinity are diversely moved by the particles of\nthe same bodies, separated from each other and floating in the\nsaliva in the mouth, and thus cause sensations of diverse tastes\naccording to the diversity of figure in these particles. [Footnote:\nIn the French this section begins, \"Taste, after touch the grossest\nof the senses,\" etc.]\nCXCIII. Of smell.\nThirdly, two nerves also or appendages of the brain, for they do not\ngo beyond the limits of the skull, are moved by the particles of\nterrestrial bodies, separated and flying in the air, not indeed by\nall particles indifferently, but by those only that are sufficiently\nsubtle and penetrating to enter the pores of the bone we call the\nspongy, when drawn into the nostrils, and thus to reach the nerves.\nFrom the different motions of these particles arise the sensations\nof the different smells.\nCXCIV. Of hearing.\nFourthly, there are two nerves within the ears, so attached to three\nsmall bones that are mutually sustaining, and the first of which\nrests on the small membrane that covers the cavity we call the\ntympanum of the ear, that all the diverse vibrations which the\nsurrounding air communicates to this membrane are transmitted to the\nmind by these nerves, and these vibrations give rise, according to\ntheir diversity, to the sensations of the different sounds.\nCXCV. Of sight.\nFinally, the extremities of the optic nerves, composing the coat in\nthe eyes called the retina, are not moved by the air nor by any\nterrestrial object, but only by the globules of the second element,\nwhence we have the sense of light and colours: as I have already at\nsufficient length explained in the Dioptrics and treatise of\nMeteors. [Footnote: In the French this section begins, \"Finally,\nsight is the most subtle of all the senses,\" etc.]\nCXCVI. That the soul perceives only in so far as it is in the\nbrain.\nIt is clearly established, however, that the soul does not perceive\nin so far as it is in each member of the body, but only in so far as\nit is in the brain, where the nerves by their movements convey to it\nthe diverse actions of the external objects that touch the parts of\nthe body in which they are inserted. For, in the first place, there\nare various maladies, which, though they affect the brain alone, yet\nbring disorder upon, or deprive us altogether of the use of, our\nsenses, just as sleep, which affects the brain only, and yet takes\nfrom us daily during a great part of our time the faculty of\nperception, which afterwards in our waking state is restored to us.\nThe second proof is, that though there be no disease in the brain,\n[or in the members in which the organs of the external senses are],\nit is nevertheless sufficient to take away sensation from the part\nof the body where the nerves terminate, if only the movement of one\nof the nerves that extend from the brain to these members be\nobstructed in any part of the distance that is between the two. And\nthe last proof is, that we sometimes feel pain as if in certain of\nour members, the cause of which, however, is not in these members\nwhere it is felt, but somewhere nearer the brain, through which the\nnerves pass that give to the mind the sensation of it. I could\nestablish this fact by innumerable experiments; I will here,\nhowever, merely refer to one of them. A girl suffering from a bad\nulcer in the hand, had her eyes bandaged whenever the surgeon came\nto visit her, not being able to bear the sight of the dressing of\nthe sore; and, the gangrene having spread, after the expiry of a few\ndays the arm was amputated from the elbow [without the girl's\nknowledge]; linen cloths tied one above the other were substituted\nin place of the part amputated, so that she remained for some time\nwithout knowing that the operation had been performed, and meanwhile\nshe complained of feeling various pains, sometimes in one finger of\nthe hand that was cut off, and sometimes in another. The only\nexplanation of this is, that the nerves which before stretched\ndownwards from the brain to the hand, and then terminated in the arm\nclose to the elbow, were there moved in the same way as they\nrequired to be moved before in the hand for the purpose of\nimpressing on the mind residing in the brain the sensation of pain\nin this or that finger. [And this clearly shows that the pain of the\nhand is not felt by the mind in so far as it is in the hand, but in\nso far as it is in the brain.]\nCXCVII. That the nature of the mind is such that from the motion\nalone of body the various sensations can be excited in it.\nIn the next place, it can be proved that our mind is of such a\nnature that the motions of the body alone are sufficient to excite\nin it all sorts of thoughts, without it being necessary that these\nshould in any way resemble the motions which give rise to them, and\nespecially that these motions can excite in it those confused\nthoughts called sensations (SENSUS, SENSATIONES). For we see that\nwords, whether uttered by the voice or merely written, excite in our\nminds all kinds of thoughts and emotions. On the same paper, with\nthe same pen and ink, by merely moving the point of the pen over the\npaper in a particular way, we can trace letters that will raise in\nthe minds of our readers the thoughts of combats, tempests, or the\nfuries, and the passions of indignation and sorrow; in place of\nwhich, if the pen be moved in another way hardly different from the\nformer, this slight change will cause thoughts widely different from\nthe above, such as those of repose, peace, pleasantness, and the\nquite opposite passions of love and joy. Some one will perhaps\nobject that writing and speech do not immediately excite in the mind\nany passions, or imaginations of things different from the letters\nand sounds, but afford simply the knowledge of these, on occasion of\nwhich the mind, understanding the signification of the words,\nafterwards excites in itself the imaginations and passions that\ncorrespond to the words. But what will be said of the sensations of\npain and titillation? The motion merely of a sword cutting a part of\nour skin causes pain, [but does not on that account make us aware of\nthe motion or figure of the sword]. And it is certain that this\nsensation of pain is not less different from the motion that causes\nit, or from that of the part of our body which the sword cuts, than\nare the sensations we have of colour, sound, odour, or taste. On\nthis ground we may conclude that our mind is of such a nature that\nthe motions alone of certain bodies can also easily excite in it all\nthe other sensations, as the motion of a sword excites in it the\nsensation of pain.\nCXCVIII. That by our senses we know nothing of external objects\nbeyond their figure [or situation], magnitude, and motion.\nBesides, we observe no such difference between the nerves as to lead\nus to judge that one set of them convey to the brain from the organs\nof the external senses anything different from another, or that\nanything at all reaches the brain besides the local motion of the\nnerves themselves. And we see that local motion alone causes in us\nnot only the sensation of titillation and of pain, but also of light\nand sounds. For if we receive a blow on the eye of sufficient force\nto cause the vibration of the stroke to reach the retina, we see\nnumerous sparks of fire, which, nevertheless, are not out of our\neye; and when we stop our ear with our finger, we hear a humming\nsound, the cause of which can only proceed from the agitation of the\nair that is shut up within it. Finally, we frequently observe that\nheat [hardness, weight], and the other sensible qualities, as far as\nthey are in objects, and also the forms of those bodies that are\npurely material, as, for example, the forms of fire, are produced in\nthem by the motion of certain other bodies, and that these in their\nturn likewise produce other motions in other bodies. And we can\neasily conceive how the motion of one body may be caused by that of\nanother, and diversified by the size, figure, and situation of its\nparts, but we are wholly unable to conceive how these same things\n(viz., size, figure, and motion), can produce something else of a\nnature entirely different from themselves, as, for example, those\nsubstantial forms and real qualities which many philosophers suppose\nto be in bodies; nor likewise can we conceive how these qualities or\nforms possess force to cause motions in other bodies. But since we\nknow, from the nature of our soul, that the diverse motions of body\nare sufficient to produce in it all the sensations which it has, and\nsince we learn from experience that several of its sensations are in\nreality caused by such motions, while we do not discover that\nanything besides these motions ever passes from the organs of the\nexternal senses to the brain, we have reason to conclude that we in\nno way likewise apprehend that in external objects, which we call\nlight, colour, smell, taste, sound, heat or cold, and the other\ntactile qualities, or that which we call their substantial forms,\nunless as the various dispositions of these objects which have the\npower of moving our nerves in various ways. [Footnote: \"the diverse\nfigures, situations, magnitudes, and motions of their parts.\"--\nFrench.]\nCXCIX. That there is no phenomenon of nature whose explanation has\nbeen omitted in this treatise.\nAnd thus it may be gathered, from an enumeration that is easily\nmade, that there is no phenomenon of nature whose explanation has\nbeen omitted in this treatise; for beyond what is perceived by the\nsenses, there is nothing that can be considered a phenomenon of\nnature. But leaving out of account motion, magnitude, figure, [and\nthe situation of the parts of each body], which I have explained as\nthey exist in body, we perceive nothing out of us by our senses\nexcept light, colours, smells, tastes, sounds, and the tactile\nqualities; and these I have recently shown to be nothing more, at\nleast so far as they are known to us, than certain dispositions of\nthe objects, consisting in magnitude, figure, and motion.\nCC. That this treatise contains no principles which are not\nuniversally received; and that this philosophy is not new, but of\nall others the most ancient and common.\nBut I am desirous also that it should be observed that, though I\nhave here endeavoured to give an explanation of the whole nature of\nmaterial things, I have nevertheless made use of no principle which\nwas not received and approved by Aristotle, and by the other\nphilosophers of all ages; so that this philosophy, so far from being\nnew, is of all others the most ancient and common: for I have in\ntruth merely considered the figure, motion, and magnitude of bodies,\nand examined what must follow from their mutual concourse on the\nprinciples of mechanics, which are confirmed by certain and daily\nexperience. But no one ever doubted that bodies are moved, and that\nthey are of various sizes and figures, according to the diversity of\nwhich their motions also vary, and that from mutual collision those\nsomewhat greater than others are divided into many smaller, and thus\nchange figure. We have experience of the truth of this, not merely\nby a single sense, but by several, as touch, sight, and hearing: we\nalso distinctly imagine and understand it. This cannot be said of\nany of the other things that fall under our senses, as colours,\nsounds, and the like; for each of these affects but one of our\nsenses, and merely impresses upon our imagination a confused image\nof itself, affording our understanding no distinct knowledge of what\nit is.\nCCI. That sensible bodies are composed of insensible particles.\nBut I allow many particles in each body that are perceived by none\nof our senses, and this will not perhaps be approved of by those who\ntake the senses for the measure of the knowable. [We greatly wrong\nhuman reason, however, as appears to me, if we suppose that it does\nnot go beyond the eye-sight]; for no one can doubt that there are\nbodies so small as not to be perceptible by any of our senses,\nprovided he only consider what is each moment added to those bodies\nthat are being increased little by little, and what is taken from\nthose that are diminished in the same way. A tree increases daily,\nand it is impossible to conceive how it becomes greater than it was\nbefore, unless we at the same time conceive that some body is added\nto it. But who ever observed by the senses those small bodies that\nare in one day added to a tree while growing? Among the philosophers\nat least, those who hold that quantity is indefinitely divisible,\nought to admit that in the division the parts may become so small as\nto be wholly imperceptible. And indeed it ought not to be a matter\nof surprise, that we are unable to perceive very minute bodies; for\nthe nerves that must be moved by objects to cause perception are not\nthemselves very minute, but are like small cords, being composed of\na quantity of smaller fibres, and thus the most minute bodies are\nnot capable of moving them. Nor do I think that any one who makes\nuse of his reason will deny that we philosophize with much greater\ntruth when we judge of what takes place in those small bodies which\nare imperceptible from their minuteness only, after the analogy of\nwhat we see occurring in those we do perceive, [and in this way\nexplain all that is in nature, as I have essayed to do in this\ntreatise], than when we give an explanation of the same things by\ninventing I know not what novelties, that have no relation to the\nthings we actually perceive, [as first matter, substantial forms,\nand all that grand array of qualities which many are in the habit of\nsupposing, each of which is more difficult to comprehend than all\nthat is professed to be explained by means of them].\nCCII. That the philosophy of Democritus is not less different from\nours than from the common. [Footnote: \"that of Aristotle or the\nothers.\"--French.]\nBut it may be said that Democritus also supposed certain corpuscles\nthat were of various figures, sizes, and motions, from the heaping\ntogether and mutual concourse of which all sensible bodies arose;\nand, nevertheless, his mode of philosophizing is commonly rejected\nby all. To this I reply that the philosophy of Democritus was never\nrejected by any one, because he allowed the existence of bodies\nsmaller than those we perceive, and attributed to them diverse\nsizes, figures, and motions, for no one can doubt that there are in\nreality such, as we have already shown; but it was rejected, in the\nfirst place, because he supposed that these corpuscles were\nindivisible, on which ground I also reject it; in the second place,\nbecause he imagined there was a vacuum about them, which I show to\nbe impossible; thirdly, because he attributed gravity to these\nbodies, of which I deny the existence in any body, in so far as a\nbody is considered by itself, because it is a quality that depends\non the relations of situation and motion which several bodies bear\nto each other; and, finally, because he has not explained in\nparticular how all things arose from the concourse of corpuscles\nalone, or, if he gave this explanation with regard to a few of them,\nhis whole reasoning was far from being coherent, [or such as would\nwarrant us in extending the same explanation to the whole of\nnature]. This, at least, is the verdict we must give regarding his\nphilosophy, if we may judge of his opinions from what has been\nhanded down to us in writing. I leave it to others to determine\nwhether the philosophy I profess possesses a valid coherency, [and\nwhether on its principles we can make the requisite number of\ndeductions; and, inasmuch as the consideration of figure, magnitude,\nand motion has been admitted by Aristotle and by all the others, as\nwell as by Democritus, and since I reject all that the latter has\nsupposed, with this single exception, while I reject generally all\nthat has been supposed by the others, it is plain that this mode of\nphilosophizing has no more affinity with that of Democritus than of\nany other particular sect].\nCCIII. How we may arrive at the knowledge of the figures,\n[magnitudes], and motions of the insensible particles of bodies.\nBut, since I assign determinate figures, magnitudes, and motions to\nthe insensible particles of bodies, as if I had seen them, whereas I\nadmit that they do not fall under the senses, some one will perhaps\ndemand how I have come by my knowledge of them. [To this I reply,\nthat I first considered in general all the clear and distinct\nnotions of material things that are to be found in our\nunderstanding, and that, finding no others except those of figures,\nmagnitudes, and motions, and of the rules according to which these\nthree things can be diversified by each other, which rules are the\nprinciples of geometry and mechanics, I judged that all the\nknowledge man can have of nature must of necessity be drawn from\nthis source; because all the other notions we have of sensible\nthings, as confused and obscure, can be of no avail in affording us\nthe knowledge of anything out of ourselves, but must serve rather to\nimpede it]. Thereupon, taking as my ground of inference the simplest\nand best known of the principles that have been implanted in our\nminds by nature, I considered the chief differences that could\npossibly subsist between the magnitudes, and figures, and situations\nof bodies insensible on account of their smallness alone, and what\nsensible effects could be produced by their various modes of coming\ninto contact; and afterwards, when I found like effects in the\nbodies that we perceive by our senses, I judged that they could have\nbeen thus produced, especially since no other mode of explaining\nthem could be devised. And in this matter the example of several\nbodies made by art was of great service to me: for I recognize no\ndifference between these and natural bodies beyond this, that the\neffects of machines depend for the most part on the agency of\ncertain instruments, which, as they must bear some proportion to the\nhands of those who make them, are always so large that their figures\nand motions can be seen; in place of which, the effects of natural\nbodies almost always depend upon certain organs so minute as to\nescape our senses. And it is certain that all the rules of mechanics\nbelong also to physics, of which it is a part or species, [so that\nall that is artificial is withal natural]: for it is not less\nnatural for a clock, made of the requisite number of wheels, to mark\nthe hours, than for a tree, which has sprung from this or that seed,\nto produce the fruit peculiar to it. Accordingly, just as those who\nare familiar with automata, when they are informed of the use of a\nmachine, and see some of its parts, easily infer from these the way\nin which the others, that are not seen by them, are made; so from\nconsidering the sensible effects and parts of natural bodies, I have\nessayed to determine the character of their causes and insensible\nparts.\nCCIV. That, touching the things which our senses do not perceive,\nit is sufficient to explain how they can be, [and that this is all\nthat Aristotle has essayed].\nBut here some one will perhaps reply, that although I have supposed\ncauses which could produce all natural objects, we ought not on this\naccount to conclude that they were produced by these causes; for,\njust as the same artisan can make two clocks, which, though they\nboth equally well indicate the time, and are not different in\noutward appearance, have nevertheless nothing resembling in the\ncomposition of their wheels; so doubtless the Supreme Maker of\nthings has an infinity of diverse means at his disposal, by each of\nwhich he could have made all the things of this world to appear as\nwe see them, without it being possible for the human mind to know\nwhich of all these means he chose to employ. I most freely concede\nthis; and I believe that I have done all that was required, if the\ncauses I have assigned are such that their effects accurately\ncorrespond to all the phenomena of nature, without determining\nwhether it is by these or by others that they are actually produced.\nAnd it will be sufficient for the use of life to know the causes\nthus imagined, for medicine, mechanics, and in general all the arts\nto which the knowledge of physics is of service, have for their end\nonly those effects that are sensible, and that are accordingly to be\nreckoned among the phenomena of nature. [Footnote: \"have for their\nend only to apply certain sensible bodies to each other in such a\nway that, in the course of natural causes, certain sensible effects\nmay be produced; and we will be able to accomplish this quite as\nwell by considering the series of certain causes thus imagined,\nalthough false, as if they were the true, since this series is\nsupposed similar as far as regards sensible effects.\"-French.]\nAnd lest it should be supposed that Aristotle did, or professed to\ndo, anything more than this, it ought to be remembered that he\nhimself expressly says, at the commencement of the seventh chapter\nof the first book of the Meteorologies, that, with regard to things\nwhich are not manifest to the senses, he thinks to adduce sufficient\nreasons and demonstrations of them, if he only shows that they may\nbe such as he explains them. [Footnote: words in Greek]\nCCV. That nevertheless there is a moral certainty that all the\nthings of this world are such as has been here shown they may be.\nBut nevertheless, that I may not wrong the truth by supposing it\nless certain than it is, I will here distinguish two kinds of\ncertitude. The first is called moral, that is, a certainty\nsufficient for the conduct of life, though, if we look to the\nabsolute power of God, what is morally certain may be false. [Thus,\nthose who never visited Rome do not doubt that it is a city of\nItaly, though it might be that all from whom they got their\ninformation were deceived]. Again, if any one, wishing to decipher a\nletter written in Latin characters that are not placed in regular\norder, bethinks himself of reading a B wherever an A is found, and a\nC wherever there is a B, and thus of substituting in place of each\nletter the one which follows it in the order of the alphabet, and if\nby this means he finds that there are certain Latin words composed\nof these, he will not doubt that the true meaning of the writing is\ncontained in these words, although he may discover this only by\nconjecture, and although it is possible that the writer of it did\nnot arrange the letters on this principle of alphabetical order, but\non some other, and thus concealed another meaning in it: for this is\nso improbable [especially when the cipher contains a number of\nwords] as to seem incredible. But they who observe how many things\nregarding the magnet, fire, and the fabric of the whole world, are\nhere deduced from a very small number of principles, though they\ndeemed that I had taken them up at random and without grounds, will\nyet perhaps acknowledge that it could hardly happen that so many\nthings should cohere if these principles were false.\nCCVI. That we possess even more than a moral certainty of it.\nBesides, there are some, even among natural, things which we judge\nto be absolutely certain. [Absolute certainty arises when we judge\nthat it is impossible a thing can be otherwise than as we think it].\nThis certainty is founded on the metaphysical ground, that, as God\nis supremely good and the source of all truth, the faculty of\ndistinguishing truth from error which he gave us, cannot be\nfallacious so long as we use it aright, and distinctly perceive\nanything by it. Of this character are the demonstrations of\nmathematics, the knowledge that material things exist, and the clear\nreasonings that are formed regarding them. The results I have given\nin this treatise will perhaps be admitted to a place in the class of\ntruths that are absolutely certain, if it be considered that they\nare deduced in a continuous series from the first and most\nelementary principles of human knowledge; especially if it be\nsufficiently understood that we can perceive no external objects\nunless some local motion be caused by them in our nerves, and that\nsuch motion cannot be caused by the fixed stars, owing to their\ngreat distance from us, unless a motion be also produced in them and\nin the whole heavens lying between them and us: for these points\nbeing admitted, all the others, at least the more general doctrines\nwhich I have advanced regarding the world or earth [e. g., the\nfluidity of the heavens, Part III., Section XLVI.], will appear to\nbe almost the only possible explanations of the phenomena they\npresent.\nCCVII. That, however, I submit all my opinions to the authority of\nthe church.\nNevertheless, lest I should presume too far, I affirm nothing, but\nsubmit all these my opinions to the authority of the church and the\njudgment of the more sage; and I desire no one to believe anything I\nmay have said, unless he is constrained to admit it by the force and\nevidence of reason.", "source": "principles_philosophy.txt"}
{"text": "DISCOURSE ON THE METHOD\nOF RIGHTLY CONDUCTING THE REASON,\nAND SEEKING TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES\nby Ren\u00e9 Descartes\nContents\nPREFATORY NOTE\nPART I\nPART II\nPART III\nPART IV\nPART V\nPART VI\nPREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR\nIf this Discourse appear too long to be read at once, it may be divided\ninto six Parts: and, in the first, will be found various considerations\ntouching the Sciences; in the second, the principal rules of the Method\nwhich the Author has discovered, in the third, certain of the rules of\nMorals which he has deduced from this Method; in the fourth, the\nreasonings by which he establishes the existence of God and of the\nHuman Soul, which are the foundations of his Metaphysic; in the fifth,\nthe order of the Physical questions which he has investigated, and, in\nparticular, the explication of the motion of the heart and of some\nother difficulties pertaining to Medicine, as also the difference\nbetween the soul of man and that of the brutes; and, in the last, what\nthe Author believes to be required in order to greater advancement in\nthe investigation of Nature than has yet been made, with the reasons\nthat have induced him to write.\nPART I\nGood sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed;\nfor every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those\neven who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not\nusually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already\npossess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken the\nconviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging\naright and of distinguishing truth from error, which is properly what\nis called good sense or reason, is by nature equal in all men; and that\nthe diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some\nbeing endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely\nfrom this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do\nnot fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a\nvigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply\nit. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences,\nare open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel\nvery slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep\nalways to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake\nit.\nFor myself, I have never fancied my mind to be in any respect more\nperfect than those of the generality; on the contrary, I have often\nwished that I were equal to some others in promptitude of thought, or\nin clearness and distinctness of imagination, or in fullness and\nreadiness of memory. And besides these, I know of no other qualities\nthat contribute to the perfection of the mind; for as to the reason or\nsense, inasmuch as it is that alone which constitutes us men, and\ndistinguishes us from the brutes, I am disposed to believe that it is\nto be found complete in each individual; and on this point to adopt the\ncommon opinion of philosophers, who say that the difference of greater\nand less holds only among the accidents, and not among the forms or\nnatures of individuals of the same species.\nI will not hesitate, however, to avow my belief that it has been my\nsingular good fortune to have very early in life fallen in with certain\ntracks which have conducted me to considerations and maxims, of which I\nhave formed a method that gives me the means, as I think, of gradually\naugmenting my knowledge, and of raising it by little and little to the\nhighest point which the mediocrity of my talents and the brief duration\nof my life will permit me to reach. For I have already reaped from it\nsuch fruits that, although I have been accustomed to think lowly enough\nof myself, and although when I look with the eye of a philosopher at\nthe varied courses and pursuits of mankind at large, I find scarcely\none which does not appear in vain and useless, I nevertheless derive\nthe highest satisfaction from the progress I conceive myself to have\nalready made in the search after truth, and cannot help entertaining\nsuch expectations of the future as to believe that if, among the\noccupations of men as men, there is any one really excellent and\nimportant, it is that which I have chosen.\nAfter all, it is possible I may be mistaken; and it is but a little\ncopper and glass, perhaps, that I take for gold and diamonds. I know\nhow very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves, and\nalso how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when\ngiven in our favor. But I shall endeavor in this discourse to describe\nthe paths I have followed, and to delineate my life as in a picture, in\norder that each one may also be able to judge of them for himself, and\nthat in the general opinion entertained of them, as gathered from\ncurrent report, I myself may have a new help towards instruction to be\nadded to those I have been in the habit of employing.\nMy present design, then, is not to teach the method which each ought to\nfollow for the right conduct of his reason, but solely to describe the\nway in which I have endeavored to conduct my own. They who set\nthemselves to give precepts must of course regard themselves as\npossessed of greater skill than those to whom they prescribe; and if\nthey err in the slightest particular, they subject themselves to\ncensure. But as this tract is put forth merely as a history, or, if you\nwill, as a tale, in which, amid some examples worthy of imitation,\nthere will be found, perhaps, as many more which it were advisable not\nto follow, I hope it will prove useful to some without being hurtful to\nany, and that my openness will find some favor with all.\nFrom my childhood, I have been familiar with letters; and as I was\ngiven to believe that by their help a clear and certain knowledge of\nall that is useful in life might be acquired, I was ardently desirous\nof instruction. But as soon as I had finished the entire course of\nstudy, at the close of which it is customary to be admitted into the\norder of the learned, I completely changed my opinion. For I found\nmyself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I\nhad advanced no farther in all my attempts at learning, than the\ndiscovery at every turn of my own ignorance. And yet I was studying in\none of the most celebrated schools in Europe, in which I thought there\nmust be learned men, if such were anywhere to be found. I had been\ntaught all that others learned there; and not contented with the\nsciences actually taught us, I had, in addition, read all the books\nthat had fallen into my hands, treating of such branches as are\nesteemed the most curious and rare. I knew the judgment which others\nhad formed of me; and I did not find that I was considered inferior to\nmy fellows, although there were among them some who were already marked\nout to fill the places of our instructors. And, in fine, our age\nappeared to me as flourishing, and as fertile in powerful minds as any\npreceding one. I was thus led to take the liberty of judging of all\nother men by myself, and of concluding that there was no science in\nexistence that was of such a nature as I had previously been given to\nbelieve.\nI still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the\nschools. I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary to\nthe understanding of the writings of the ancients; that the grace of\nfable stirs the mind; that the memorable deeds of history elevate it;\nand, if read with discretion, aid in forming the judgment; that the\nperusal of all excellent books is, as it were, to interview with the\nnoblest men of past ages, who have written them, and even a studied\ninterview, in which are discovered to us only their choicest thoughts;\nthat eloquence has incomparable force and beauty; that poesy has its\nravishing graces and delights; that in the mathematics there are many\nrefined discoveries eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive, as\nwell as further all the arts an lessen the labour of man; that numerous\nhighly useful precepts and exhortations to virtue are contained in\ntreatises on morals; that theology points out the path to heaven; that\nphilosophy affords the means of discoursing with an appearance of truth\non all matters, and commands the admiration of the more simple; that\njurisprudence, medicine, and the other sciences, secure for their\ncultivators honors and riches; and, in fine, that it is useful to\nbestow some attention upon all, even upon those abounding the most in\nsuperstition and error, that we may be in a position to determine their\nreal value, and guard against being deceived.\nBut I believed that I had already given sufficient time to languages,\nand likewise to the reading of the writings of the ancients, to their\nhistories and fables. For to hold converse with those of other ages and\nto travel, are almost the same thing. It is useful to know something of\nthe manners of different nations, that we may be enabled to form a more\ncorrect judgment regarding our own, and be prevented from thinking that\neverything contrary to our customs is ridiculous and irrational, a\nconclusion usually come to by those whose experience has been limited\nto their own country. On the other hand, when too much time is occupied\nin traveling, we become strangers to our native country; and the over\ncurious in the customs of the past are generally ignorant of those of\nthe present. Besides, fictitious narratives lead us to imagine the\npossibility of many events that are impossible; and even the most\nfaithful histories, if they do not wholly misrepresent matters, or\nexaggerate their importance to render the account of them more worthy\nof perusal, omit, at least, almost always the meanest and least\nstriking of the attendant circumstances; hence it happens that the\nremainder does not represent the truth, and that such as regulate their\nconduct by examples drawn from this source, are apt to fall into the\nextravagances of the knight-errants of romance, and to entertain\nprojects that exceed their powers.\nI esteemed eloquence highly, and was in raptures with poesy; but I\nthought that both were gifts of nature rather than fruits of study.\nThose in whom the faculty of reason is predominant, and who most\nskillfully dispose their thoughts with a view to render them clear and\nintelligible, are always the best able to persuade others of the truth\nof what they lay down, though they should speak only in the language of\nLower Brittany, and be wholly ignorant of the rules of rhetoric; and\nthose whose minds are stored with the most agreeable fancies, and who\ncan give expression to them with the greatest embellishment and\nharmony, are still the best poets, though unacquainted with the art of\npoetry.\nI was especially delighted with the mathematics, on account of the\ncertitude and evidence of their reasonings; but I had not as yet a\nprecise knowledge of their true use; and thinking that they but\ncontributed to the advancement of the mechanical arts, I was astonished\nthat foundations, so strong and solid, should have had no loftier\nsuperstructure reared on them. On the other hand, I compared the\ndisquisitions of the ancient moralists to very towering and magnificent\npalaces with no better foundation than sand and mud: they laud the\nvirtues very highly, and exhibit them as estimable far above anything\non earth; but they give us no adequate criterion of virtue, and\nfrequently that which they designate with so fine a name is but apathy,\nor pride, or despair, or parricide.\nI revered our theology, and aspired as much as any one to reach heaven:\nbut being given assuredly to understand that the way is not less open\nto the most ignorant than to the most learned, and that the revealed\ntruths which lead to heaven are above our comprehension, I did not\npresume to subject them to the impotency of my reason; and I thought\nthat in order competently to undertake their examination, there was\nneed of some special help from heaven, and of being more than man.\nOf philosophy I will say nothing, except that when I saw that it had\nbeen cultivated for many ages by the most distinguished men, and that\nyet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is not still\nin dispute, and nothing, therefore, which is above doubt, I did not\npresume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that\nof others; and further, when I considered the number of conflicting\nopinions touching a single matter that may be upheld by learned men,\nwhile there can be but one true, I reckoned as well-nigh false all that\nwas only probable.\nAs to the other sciences, inasmuch as these borrow their principles\nfrom philosophy, I judged that no solid superstructures could be reared\non foundations so infirm; and neither the honor nor the gain held out\nby them was sufficient to determine me to their cultivation: for I was\nnot, thank Heaven, in a condition which compelled me to make\nmerchandise of science for the bettering of my fortune; and though I\nmight not profess to scorn glory as a cynic, I yet made very slight\naccount of that honor which I hoped to acquire only through fictitious\ntitles. And, in fine, of false sciences I thought I knew the worth\nsufficiently to escape being deceived by the professions of an\nalchemist, the predictions of an astrologer, the impostures of a\nmagician, or by the artifices and boasting of any of those who profess\nto know things of which they are ignorant.\nFor these reasons, as soon as my age permitted me to pass from under\nthe control of my instructors, I entirely abandoned the study of\nletters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the\nknowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world. I spent the\nremainder of my youth in traveling, in visiting courts and armies, in\nholding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, in\ncollecting varied experience, in proving myself in the different\nsituations into which fortune threw me, and, above all, in making such\nreflection on the matter of my experience as to secure my improvement.\nFor it occurred to me that I should find much more truth in the\nreasonings of each individual with reference to the affairs in which he\nis personally interested, and the issue of which must presently punish\nhim if he has judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of letters\nin his study, regarding speculative matters that are of no practical\nmoment, and followed by no consequences to himself, farther, perhaps,\nthan that they foster his vanity the better the more remote they are\nfrom common sense; requiring, as they must in this case, the exercise\nof greater ingenuity and art to render them probable. In addition, I\nhad always a most earnest desire to know how to distinguish the true\nfrom the false, in order that I might be able clearly to discriminate\nthe right path in life, and proceed in it with confidence.\nIt is true that, while busied only in considering the manners of other\nmen, I found here, too, scarce any ground for settled conviction, and\nremarked hardly less contradiction among them than in the opinions of\nthe philosophers. So that the greatest advantage I derived from the\nstudy consisted in this, that, observing many things which, however\nextravagant and ridiculous to our apprehension, are yet by common\nconsent received and approved by other great nations, I learned to\nentertain too decided a belief in regard to nothing of the truth of\nwhich I had been persuaded merely by example and custom; and thus I\ngradually extricated myself from many errors powerful enough to darken\nour natural intelligence, and incapacitate us in great measure from\nlistening to reason. But after I had been occupied several years in\nthus studying the book of the world, and in essaying to gather some\nexperience, I at length resolved to make myself an object of study, and\nto employ all the powers of my mind in choosing the paths I ought to\nfollow, an undertaking which was accompanied with greater success than\nit would have been had I never quitted my country or my books.\nPART II\nI was then in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country,\nwhich have not yet been brought to a termination; and as I was\nreturning to the army from the coronation of the emperor, the setting\nin of winter arrested me in a locality where, as I found no society to\ninterest me, and was besides fortunately undisturbed by any cares or\npassions, I remained the whole day in seclusion, with full opportunity\nto occupy my attention with my own thoughts. Of these one of the very\nfirst that occurred to me was, that there is seldom so much perfection\nin works composed of many separate parts, upon which different hands\nhad been employed, as in those completed by a single master. Thus it is\nobservable that the buildings which a single architect has planned and\nexecuted, are generally more elegant and commodious than those which\nseveral have attempted to improve, by making old walls serve for\npurposes for which they were not originally built. Thus also, those\nancient cities which, from being at first only villages, have become,\nin course of time, large towns, are usually but ill laid out compared\nwith the regularity constructed towns which a professional architect\nhas freely planned on an open plain; so that although the several\nbuildings of the former may often equal or surpass in beauty those of\nthe latter, yet when one observes their indiscriminate juxtaposition,\nthere a large one and here a small, and the consequent crookedness and\nirregularity of the streets, one is disposed to allege that chance\nrather than any human will guided by reason must have led to such an\narrangement. And if we consider that nevertheless there have been at\nall times certain officers whose duty it was to see that private\nbuildings contributed to public ornament, the difficulty of reaching\nhigh perfection with but the materials of others to operate on, will be\nreadily acknowledged. In the same way I fancied that those nations\nwhich, starting from a semi-barbarous state and advancing to\ncivilization by slow degrees, have had their laws successively\ndetermined, and, as it were, forced upon them simply by experience of\nthe hurtfulness of particular crimes and disputes, would by this\nprocess come to be possessed of less perfect institutions than those\nwhich, from the commencement of their association as communities, have\nfollowed the appointments of some wise legislator. It is thus quite\ncertain that the constitution of the true religion, the ordinances of\nwhich are derived from God, must be incomparably superior to that of\nevery other. And, to speak of human affairs, I believe that the\npre-eminence of Sparta was due not to the goodness of each of its laws\nin particular, for many of these were very strange, and even opposed to\ngood morals, but to the circumstance that, originated by a single\nindividual, they all tended to a single end. In the same way I thought\nthat the sciences contained in books (such of them at least as are made\nup of probable reasonings, without demonstrations), composed as they\nare of the opinions of many different individuals massed together, are\nfarther removed from truth than the simple inferences which a man of\ngood sense using his natural and unprejudiced judgment draws respecting\nthe matters of his experience. And because we have all to pass through\na state of infancy to manhood, and have been of necessity, for a length\nof time, governed by our desires and preceptors (whose dictates were\nfrequently conflicting, while neither perhaps always counseled us for\nthe best), I farther concluded that it is almost impossible that our\njudgments can be so correct or solid as they would have been, had our\nreason been mature from the moment of our birth, and had we always been\nguided by it alone.\nIt is true, however, that it is not customary to pull down all the\nhouses of a town with the single design of rebuilding them differently,\nand thereby rendering the streets more handsome; but it often happens\nthat a private individual takes down his own with the view of erecting\nit anew, and that people are even sometimes constrained to this when\ntheir houses are in danger of falling from age, or when the foundations\nare insecure. With this before me by way of example, I was persuaded\nthat it would indeed be preposterous for a private individual to think\nof reforming a state by fundamentally changing it throughout, and\noverturning it in order to set it up amended; and the same I thought\nwas true of any similar project for reforming the body of the sciences,\nor the order of teaching them established in the schools: but as for\nthe opinions which up to that time I had embraced, I thought that I\ncould not do better than resolve at once to sweep them wholly away,\nthat I might afterwards be in a position to admit either others more\ncorrect, or even perhaps the same when they had undergone the scrutiny\nof reason. I firmly believed that in this way I should much better\nsucceed in the conduct of my life, than if I built only upon old\nfoundations, and leaned upon principles which, in my youth, I had taken\nupon trust. For although I recognized various difficulties in this\nundertaking, these were not, however, without remedy, nor once to be\ncompared with such as attend the slightest reformation in public\naffairs. Large bodies, if once overthrown, are with great difficulty\nset up again, or even kept erect when once seriously shaken, and the\nfall of such is always disastrous. Then if there are any imperfections\nin the constitutions of states (and that many such exist the diversity\nof constitutions is alone sufficient to assure us), custom has without\ndoubt materially smoothed their inconveniences, and has even managed to\nsteer altogether clear of, or insensibly corrected a number which\nsagacity could not have provided against with equal effect; and, in\nfine, the defects are almost always more tolerable than the change\nnecessary for their removal; in the same manner that highways which\nwind among mountains, by being much frequented, become gradually so\nsmooth and commodious, that it is much better to follow them than to\nseek a straighter path by climbing over the tops of rocks and\ndescending to the bottoms of precipices.\nHence it is that I cannot in any degree approve of those restless and\nbusy meddlers who, called neither by birth nor fortune to take part in\nthe management of public affairs, are yet always projecting reforms;\nand if I thought that this tract contained aught which might justify\nthe suspicion that I was a victim of such folly, I would by no means\npermit its publication. I have never contemplated anything higher than\nthe reformation of my own opinions, and basing them on a foundation\nwholly my own. And although my own satisfaction with my work has led me\nto present here a draft of it, I do not by any means therefore\nrecommend to every one else to make a similar attempt. Those whom God\nhas endowed with a larger measure of genius will entertain, perhaps,\ndesigns still more exalted; but for the many I am much afraid lest even\nthe present undertaking be more than they can safely venture to\nimitate. The single design to strip one\u2019s self of all past beliefs is\none that ought not to be taken by every one. The majority of men is\ncomposed of two classes, for neither of which would this be at all a\nbefitting resolution: in the first place, of those who with more than a\ndue confidence in their own powers, are precipitate in their judgments\nand want the patience requisite for orderly and circumspect thinking;\nwhence it happens, that if men of this class once take the liberty to\ndoubt of their accustomed opinions, and quit the beaten highway, they\nwill never be able to thread the byway that would lead them by a\nshorter course, and will lose themselves and continue to wander for\nlife; in the second place, of those who, possessed of sufficient sense\nor modesty to determine that there are others who excel them in the\npower of discriminating between truth and error, and by whom they may\nbe instructed, ought rather to content themselves with the opinions of\nsuch than trust for more correct to their own reason.\nFor my own part, I should doubtless have belonged to the latter class,\nhad I received instruction from but one master, or had I never known\nthe diversities of opinion that from time immemorial have prevailed\namong men of the greatest learning. But I had become aware, even so\nearly as during my college life, that no opinion, however absurd and\nincredible, can be imagined, which has not been maintained by some on\nof the philosophers; and afterwards in the course of my travels I\nremarked that all those whose opinions are decidedly repugnant to ours\nare not in that account barbarians and savages, but on the contrary\nthat many of these nations make an equally good, if not better, use of\ntheir reason than we do. I took into account also the very different\ncharacter which a person brought up from infancy in France or Germany\nexhibits, from that which, with the same mind originally, this\nindividual would have possessed had he lived always among the Chinese\nor with savages, and the circumstance that in dress itself the fashion\nwhich pleased us ten years ago, and which may again, perhaps, be\nreceived into favor before ten years have gone, appears to us at this\nmoment extravagant and ridiculous. I was thus led to infer that the\nground of our opinions is far more custom and example than any certain\nknowledge. And, finally, although such be the ground of our opinions, I\nremarked that a plurality of suffrages is no guarantee of truth where\nit is at all of difficult discovery, as in such cases it is much more\nlikely that it will be found by one than by many. I could, however,\nselect from the crowd no one whose opinions seemed worthy of\npreference, and thus I found myself constrained, as it were, to use my\nown reason in the conduct of my life.\nBut like one walking alone and in the dark, I resolved to proceed so\nslowly and with such circumspection, that if I did not advance far, I\nwould at least guard against falling. I did not even choose to dismiss\nsummarily any of the opinions that had crept into my belief without\nhaving been introduced by reason, but first of all took sufficient time\ncarefully to satisfy myself of the general nature of the task I was\nsetting myself, and ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the\nknowledge of whatever lay within the compass of my powers.\nAmong the branches of philosophy, I had, at an earlier period, given\nsome attention to logic, and among those of the mathematics to\ngeometrical analysis and algebra,--three arts or sciences which ought,\nas I conceived, to contribute something to my design. But, on\nexamination, I found that, as for logic, its syllogisms and the\nmajority of its other precepts are of avail--rather in the\ncommunication of what we already know, or even as the art of Lully, in\nspeaking without judgment of things of which we are ignorant, than in\nthe investigation of the unknown; and although this science contains\nindeed a number of correct and very excellent precepts, there are,\nnevertheless, so many others, and these either injurious or\nsuperfluous, mingled with the former, that it is almost quite as\ndifficult to effect a severance of the true from the false as it is to\nextract a Diana or a Minerva from a rough block of marble. Then as to\nthe analysis of the ancients and the algebra of the moderns, besides\nthat they embrace only matters highly abstract, and, to appearance, of\nno use, the former is so exclusively restricted to the consideration of\nfigures, that it can exercise the understanding only on condition of\ngreatly fatiguing the imagination; and, in the latter, there is so\ncomplete a subjection to certain rules and formulas, that there results\nan art full of confusion and obscurity calculated to embarrass, instead\nof a science fitted to cultivate the mind. By these considerations I\nwas induced to seek some other method which would comprise the\nadvantages of the three and be exempt from their defects. And as a\nmultitude of laws often only hampers justice, so that a state is best\ngoverned when, with few laws, these are rigidly administered; in like\nmanner, instead of the great number of precepts of which logic is\ncomposed, I believed that the four following would prove perfectly\nsufficient for me, provided I took the firm and unwavering resolution\nnever in a single instance to fail in observing them.\nThe first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly\nknow to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and\nprejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgement than what was\npresented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground\nof doubt.\nThe second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into\nas many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate\nsolution.\nThe third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing\nwith objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by little\nand little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more\ncomplex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects\nwhich in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and\nsequence.\nAnd the _last_, in every case to make enumerations so complete, and\nreviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.\nThe long chains of simple and easy reasonings by means of which\ngeometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most\ndifficult demonstrations, had led me to imagine that all things, to the\nknowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same\nway, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond\nour reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, provided only we\nabstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in\nour thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from\nanother. And I had little difficulty in determining the objects with\nwhich it was necessary to commence, for I was already persuaded that it\nmust be with the simplest and easiest to know, and, considering that of\nall those who have hitherto sought truth in the sciences, the\nmathematicians alone have been able to find any demonstrations, that\nis, any certain and evident reasons, I did not doubt but that such must\nhave been the rule of their investigations. I resolved to commence,\ntherefore, with the examination of the simplest objects, not\nanticipating, however, from this any other advantage than that to be\nfound in accustoming my mind to the love and nourishment of truth, and\nto a distaste for all such reasonings as were unsound. But I had no\nintention on that account of attempting to master all the particular\nsciences commonly denominated mathematics: but observing that, however\ndifferent their objects, they all agree in considering only the various\nrelations or proportions subsisting among those objects, I thought it\nbest for my purpose to consider these proportions in the most general\nform possible, without referring them to any objects in particular,\nexcept such as would most facilitate the knowledge of them, and without\nby any means restricting them to these, that afterwards I might thus be\nthe better able to apply them to every other class of objects to which\nthey are legitimately applicable. Perceiving further, that in order to\nunderstand these relations I should sometimes have to consider them one\nby one and sometimes only to bear them in mind, or embrace them in the\naggregate, I thought that, in order the better to consider them\nindividually, I should view them as subsisting between straight lines,\nthan which I could find no objects more simple, or capable of being\nmore distinctly represented to my imagination and senses; and on the\nother hand, that in order to retain them in the memory or embrace an\naggregate of many, I should express them by certain characters the\nbriefest possible. In this way I believed that I could borrow all that\nwas best both in geometrical analysis and in algebra, and correct all\nthe defects of the one by help of the other.\nAnd, in point of fact, the accurate observance of these few precepts\ngave me, I take the liberty of saying, such ease in unraveling all the\nquestions embraced in these two sciences, that in the two or three\nmonths I devoted to their examination, not only did I reach solutions\nof questions I had formerly deemed exceedingly difficult but even as\nregards questions of the solution of which I continued ignorant, I was\nenabled, as it appeared to me, to determine the means whereby, and the\nextent to which a solution was possible; results attributable to the\ncircumstance that I commenced with the simplest and most general\ntruths, and that thus each truth discovered was a rule available in the\ndiscovery of subsequent ones Nor in this perhaps shall I appear too\nvain, if it be considered that, as the truth on any particular point is\none whoever apprehends the truth, knows all that on that point can be\nknown. The child, for example, who has been instructed in the elements\nof arithmetic, and has made a particular addition, according to rule,\nmay be assured that he has found, with respect to the sum of the\nnumbers before him, and that in this instance is within the reach of\nhuman genius. Now, in conclusion, the method which teaches adherence to\nthe true order, and an exact enumeration of all the conditions of the\nthing sought includes all that gives certitude to the rules of\narithmetic.\nBut the chief ground of my satisfaction with thus method, was the\nassurance I had of thereby exercising my reason in all matters, if not\nwith absolute perfection, at least with the greatest attainable by me:\nbesides, I was conscious that by its use my mind was becoming gradually\nhabituated to clearer and more distinct conceptions of its objects; and\nI hoped also, from not having restricted this method to any particular\nmatter, to apply it to the difficulties of the other sciences, with not\nless success than to those of algebra. I should not, however, on this\naccount have ventured at once on the examination of all the\ndifficulties of the sciences which presented themselves to me, for this\nwould have been contrary to the order prescribed in the method, but\nobserving that the knowledge of such is dependent on principles\nborrowed from philosophy, in which I found nothing certain, I thought\nit necessary first of all to endeavor to establish its principles. And\nbecause I observed, besides, that an inquiry of this kind was of all\nothers of the greatest moment, and one in which precipitancy and\nanticipation in judgment were most to be dreaded, I thought that I\nought not to approach it till I had reached a more mature age (being at\nthat time but twenty-three), and had first of all employed much of my\ntime in preparation for the work, as well by eradicating from my mind\nall the erroneous opinions I had up to that moment accepted, as by\namassing variety of experience to afford materials for my reasonings,\nand by continually exercising myself in my chosen method with a view to\nincreased skill in its application.\nPART III\nAnd finally, as it is not enough, before commencing to rebuild the\nhouse in which we live, that it be pulled down, and materials and\nbuilders provided, or that we engage in the work ourselves, according\nto a plan which we have beforehand carefully drawn out, but as it is\nlikewise necessary that we be furnished with some other house in which\nwe may live commodiously during the operations, so that I might not\nremain irresolute in my actions, while my reason compelled me to\nsuspend my judgement, and that I might not be prevented from living\nthenceforward in the greatest possible felicity, I formed a provisory\ncode of morals, composed of three or four maxims, with which I am\ndesirous to make you acquainted.\nThe _first_ was to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering\nfirmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated\nfrom my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter\naccording to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from\nextremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general\nconsent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living.\nFor as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought\nbecause I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced\nthat I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of\nthe most judicious; and although there are some perhaps among the\nPersians and Chinese as judicious as among ourselves, expediency seemed\nto dictate that I should regulate my practice conformably to the\nopinions of those with whom I should have to live; and it appeared to\nme that, in order to ascertain the real opinions of such, I ought\nrather to take cognizance of what they practised than of what they\nsaid, not only because, in the corruption of our manners, there are few\ndisposed to speak exactly as they believe, but also because very many\nare not aware of what it is that they really believe; for, as the act\nof mind by which a thing is believed is different from that by which we\nknow that we believe it, the one act is often found without the other.\nAlso, amid many opinions held in equal repute, I chose always the most\nmoderate, as much for the reason that these are always the most\nconvenient for practice, and probably the best (for all excess is\ngenerally vicious), as that, in the event of my falling into error, I\nmight be at less distance from the truth than if, having chosen one of\nthe extremes, it should turn out to be the other which I ought to have\nadopted. And I placed in the class of extremes especially all promises\nby which somewhat of our freedom is abridged; not that I disapproved of\nthe laws which, to provide against the instability of men of feeble\nresolution, when what is sought to be accomplished is some good, permit\nengagements by vows and contracts binding the parties to persevere in\nit, or even, for the security of commerce, sanction similar engagements\nwhere the purpose sought to be realized is indifferent: but because I\ndid not find anything on earth which was wholly superior to change, and\nbecause, for myself in particular, I hoped gradually to perfect my\njudgments, and not to suffer them to deteriorate, I would have deemed\nit a grave sin against good sense, if, for the reason that I approved\nof something at a particular time, I therefore bound myself to hold it\nfor good at a subsequent time, when perhaps it had ceased to be so, or\nI had ceased to esteem it such.\nMy _second_ maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I was\nable, and not to adhere less steadfastly to the most doubtful opinions,\nwhen once adopted, than if they had been highly certain; imitating in\nthis the example of travelers who, when they have lost their way in a\nforest, ought not to wander from side to side, far less remain in one\nplace, but proceed constantly towards the same side in as straight a\nline as possible, without changing their direction for slight reasons,\nalthough perhaps it might be chance alone which at first determined the\nselection; for in this way, if they do not exactly reach the point they\ndesire, they will come at least in the end to some place that will\nprobably be preferable to the middle of a forest. In the same way,\nsince in action it frequently happens that no delay is permissible, it\nis very certain that, when it is not in our power to determine what is\ntrue, we ought to act according to what is most probable; and even\nalthough we should not remark a greater probability in one opinion than\nin another, we ought notwithstanding to choose one or the other, and\nafterwards consider it, in so far as it relates to practice, as no\nlonger dubious, but manifestly true and certain, since the reason by\nwhich our choice has been determined is itself possessed of these\nqualities. This principle was sufficient thenceforward to rid me of all\nthose repentings and pangs of remorse that usually disturb the\nconsciences of such feeble and uncertain minds as, destitute of any\nclear and determinate principle of choice, allow themselves one day to\nadopt a course of action as the best, which they abandon the next, as\nthe opposite.\nMy _third_ maxim was to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than\nfortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and\nin general, accustom myself to the persuasion that, except our own\nthoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we\nhave done our best in things external to us, all wherein we fail of\nsuccess is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible: and this\nsingle principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring\nfor the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me\ncontented; for since our will naturally seeks those objects alone which\nthe understanding represents as in some way possible of attainment, it\nis plain, that if we consider all external goods as equally beyond our\npower, we shall no more regret the absence of such goods as seem due to\nour birth, when deprived of them without any fault of ours, than our\nnot possessing the kingdoms of China or Mexico, and thus making, so to\nspeak, a virtue of necessity, we shall no more desire health in\ndisease, or freedom in imprisonment, than we now do bodies\nincorruptible as diamonds, or the wings of birds to fly with. But I\nconfess there is need of prolonged discipline and frequently repeated\nmeditation to accustom the mind to view all objects in this light; and\nI believe that in this chiefly consisted the secret of the power of\nsuch philosophers as in former times were enabled to rise superior to\nthe influence of fortune, and, amid suffering and poverty, enjoy a\nhappiness which their gods might have envied. For, occupied incessantly\nwith the consideration of the limits prescribed to their power by\nnature, they became so entirely convinced that nothing was at their\ndisposal except their own thoughts, that this conviction was of itself\nsufficient to prevent their entertaining any desire of other objects;\nand over their thoughts they acquired a sway so absolute, that they had\nsome ground on this account for esteeming themselves more rich and more\npowerful, more free and more happy, than other men who, whatever be the\nfavors heaped on them by nature and fortune, if destitute of this\nphilosophy, can never command the realization of all their desires.\nIn fine, to conclude this code of morals, I thought of reviewing the\ndifferent occupations of men in this life, with the view of making\nchoice of the best. And, without wishing to offer any remarks on the\nemployments of others, I may state that it was my conviction that I\ncould not do better than continue in that in which I was engaged, viz.,\nin devoting my whole life to the culture of my reason, and in making\nthe greatest progress I was able in the knowledge of truth, on the\nprinciples of the method which I had prescribed to myself. This method,\nfrom the time I had begun to apply it, had been to me the source of\nsatisfaction so intense as to lead me to, believe that more perfect or\nmore innocent could not be enjoyed in this life; and as by its means I\ndaily discovered truths that appeared to me of some importance, and of\nwhich other men were generally ignorant, the gratification thence\narising so occupied my mind that I was wholly indifferent to every\nother object. Besides, the three preceding maxims were founded singly\non the design of continuing the work of self-instruction. For since God\nhas endowed each of us with some light of reason by which to\ndistinguish truth from error, I could not have believed that I ought\nfor a single moment to rest satisfied with the opinions of another,\nunless I had resolved to exercise my own judgment in examining these\nwhenever I should be duly qualified for the task. Nor could I have\nproceeded on such opinions without scruple, had I supposed that I\nshould thereby forfeit any advantage for attaining still more accurate,\nshould such exist. And, in fine, I could not have restrained my\ndesires, nor remained satisfied had I not followed a path in which I\nthought myself certain of attaining all the knowledge to the\nacquisition of which I was competent, as well as the largest amount of\nwhat is truly good which I could ever hope to secure Inasmuch as we\nneither seek nor shun any object except in so far as our understanding\nrepresents it as good or bad, all that is necessary to right action is\nright judgment, and to the best action the most correct judgment, that\nis, to the acquisition of all the virtues with all else that is truly\nvaluable and within our reach; and the assurance of such an acquisition\ncannot fail to render us contented.\nHaving thus provided myself with these maxims, and having placed them\nin reserve along with the truths of faith, which have ever occupied the\nfirst place in my belief, I came to the conclusion that I might with\nfreedom set about ridding myself of what remained of my opinions. And,\ninasmuch as I hoped to be better able successfully to accomplish this\nwork by holding intercourse with mankind, than by remaining longer shut\nup in the retirement where these thoughts had occurred to me, I betook\nme again to traveling before the winter was well ended. And, during the\nnine subsequent years, I did nothing but roam from one place to\nanother, desirous of being a spectator rather than an actor in the\nplays exhibited on the theater of the world; and, as I made it my\nbusiness in each matter to reflect particularly upon what might fairly\nbe doubted and prove a source of error, I gradually rooted out from my\nmind all the errors which had hitherto crept into it. Not that in this\nI imitated the sceptics who doubt only that they may doubt, and seek\nnothing beyond uncertainty itself; for, on the contrary, my design was\nsingly to find ground of assurance, and cast aside the loose earth and\nsand, that I might reach the rock or the clay. In this, as appears to\nme, I was successful enough; for, since I endeavored to discover the\nfalsehood or incertitude of the propositions I examined, not by feeble\nconjectures, but by clear and certain reasonings, I met with nothing so\ndoubtful as not to yield some conclusion of adequate certainty,\nalthough this were merely the inference, that the matter in question\ncontained nothing certain. And, just as in pulling down an old house,\nwe usually reserve the ruins to contribute towards the erection, so, in\ndestroying such of my opinions as I judged to be Ill-founded, I made a\nvariety of observations and acquired an amount of experience of which I\navailed myself in the establishment of more certain. And further, I\ncontinued to exercise myself in the method I had prescribed; for,\nbesides taking care in general to conduct all my thoughts according to\nits rules, I reserved some hours from time to time which I expressly\ndevoted to the employment of the method in the solution of mathematical\ndifficulties, or even in the solution likewise of some questions\nbelonging to other sciences, but which, by my having detached them from\nsuch principles of these sciences as were of inadequate certainty, were\nrendered almost mathematical: the truth of this will be manifest from\nthe numerous examples contained in this volume. And thus, without in\nappearance living otherwise than those who, with no other occupation\nthan that of spending their lives agreeably and innocently, study to\nsever pleasure from vice, and who, that they may enjoy their leisure\nwithout ennui, have recourse to such pursuits as are honorable, I was\nnevertheless prosecuting my design, and making greater progress in the\nknowledge of truth, than I might, perhaps, have made had I been engaged\nin the perusal of books merely, or in holding converse with men of\nletters.\nThese nine years passed away, however, before I had come to any\ndeterminate judgment respecting the difficulties which form matter of\ndispute among the learned, or had commenced to seek the principles of\nany philosophy more certain than the vulgar. And the examples of many\nmen of the highest genius, who had, in former times, engaged in this\ninquiry, but, as appeared to me, without success, led me to imagine it\nto be a work of so much difficulty, that I would not perhaps have\nventured on it so soon had I not heard it currently rumored that I had\nalready completed the inquiry. I know not what were the grounds of this\nopinion; and, if my conversation contributed in any measure to its\nrise, this must have happened rather from my having confessed my\nIgnorance with greater freedom than those are accustomed to do who have\nstudied a little, and expounded perhaps, the reasons that led me to\ndoubt of many of those things that by others are esteemed certain, than\nfrom my having boasted of any system of philosophy. But, as I am of a\ndisposition that makes me unwilling to be esteemed different from what\nI really am, I thought it necessary to endeavor by all means to render\nmyself worthy of the reputation accorded to me; and it is now exactly\neight years since this desire constrained me to remove from all those\nplaces where interruption from any of my acquaintances was possible,\nand betake myself to this country, in which the long duration of the\nwar has led to the establishment of such discipline, that the armies\nmaintained seem to be of use only in enabling the inhabitants to enjoy\nmore securely the blessings of peace and where, in the midst of a great\ncrowd actively engaged in business, and more careful of their own\naffairs than curious about those of others, I have been enabled to live\nwithout being deprived of any of the conveniences to be had in the most\npopulous cities, and yet as solitary and as retired as in the midst of\nthe most remote deserts.\nPART IV\nI am in doubt as to the propriety of making my first meditations in the\nplace above mentioned matter of discourse; for these are so\nmetaphysical, and so uncommon, as not, perhaps, to be acceptable to\nevery one. And yet, that it may be determined whether the foundations\nthat I have laid are sufficiently secure, I find myself in a measure\nconstrained to advert to them. I had long before remarked that, in\nrelation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above\ndoubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been\nalready said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the\nsearch after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was\ncalled for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions\nin regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order\nto ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that\nwas wholly indubitable. Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes\ndeceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really\nsuch as they presented to us; and because some men err in reasoning,\nand fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry, I,\nconvinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false\nall the reasonings I had hitherto taken for demonstrations; and\nfinally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations)\nwhich we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are\nasleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed\nthat all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind\nwhen awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams.\nBut immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to\nthink that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus\nthought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I\nthink, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such\nevidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged\nby the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might,\nwithout scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of\nwhich I was in search.\nIn the next place, I attentively examined what I was and as I observed\nthat I could suppose that I had no body, and that there was no world\nnor any place in which I might be; but that I could not therefore\nsuppose that I was not; and that, on the contrary, from the very\ncircumstance that I thought to doubt of the truth of other things, it\nmost clearly and certainly followed that I was; while, on the other\nhand, if I had only ceased to think, although all the other objects\nwhich I had ever imagined had been in reality existent, I would have\nhad no reason to believe that I existed; I thence concluded that I was\na substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking,\nand which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on\nany material thing; so that \u201cI,\u201d that is to say, the mind by which I am\nwhat I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is even more easily\nknown than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not,\nit would still continue to be all that it is.\nAfter this I inquired in general into what is essential to the truth\nand certainty of a proposition; for since I had discovered one which I\nknew to be true, I thought that I must likewise be able to discover the\nground of this certitude. And as I observed that in the words I think,\ntherefore I am, there is nothing at all which gives me assurance of\ntheir truth beyond this, that I see very clearly that in order to think\nit is necessary to exist, I concluded that I might take, as a general\nrule, the principle, that all the things which we very clearly and\ndistinctly conceive are true, only observing, however, that there is\nsome difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we distinctly\nconceive.\nIn the next place, from reflecting on the circumstance that I doubted,\nand that consequently my being was not wholly perfect (for I clearly\nsaw that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt), I was led\nto inquire whence I had learned to think of something more perfect than\nmyself; and I clearly recognized that I must hold this notion from some\nnature which in reality was more perfect. As for the thoughts of many\nother objects external to me, as of the sky, the earth, light, heat,\nand a thousand more, I was less at a loss to know whence these came;\nfor since I remarked in them nothing which seemed to render them\nsuperior to myself, I could believe that, if these were true, they were\ndependencies on my own nature, in so far as it possessed a certain\nperfection, and, if they were false, that I held them from nothing,\nthat is to say, that they were in me because of a certain imperfection\nof my nature. But this could not be the case with-the idea of a nature\nmore perfect than myself; for to receive it from nothing was a thing\nmanifestly impossible; and, because it is not less repugnant that the\nmore perfect should be an effect of, and dependence on the less\nperfect, than that something should proceed from nothing, it was\nequally impossible that I could hold it from myself: accordingly, it\nbut remained that it had been placed in me by a nature which was in\nreality more perfect than mine, and which even possessed within itself\nall the perfections of which I could form any idea; that is to say, in\na single word, which was God. And to this I added that, since I knew\nsome perfections which I did not possess, I was not the only being in\nexistence (I will here, with your permission, freely use the terms of\nthe schools); but, on the contrary, that there was of necessity some\nother more perfect Being upon whom I was dependent, and from whom I had\nreceived all that I possessed; for if I had existed alone, and\nindependently of every other being, so as to have had from myself all\nthe perfection, however little, which I actually possessed, I should\nhave been able, for the same reason, to have had from myself the whole\nremainder of perfection, of the want of which I was conscious, and thus\ncould of myself have become infinite, eternal, immutable, omniscient,\nall-powerful, and, in fine, have possessed all the perfections which I\ncould recognize in God. For in order to know the nature of God (whose\nexistence has been established by the preceding reasonings), as far as\nmy own nature permitted, I had only to consider in reference to all the\nproperties of which I found in my mind some idea, whether their\npossession was a mark of perfection; and I was assured that no one\nwhich indicated any imperfection was in him, and that none of the rest\nwas awanting. Thus I perceived that doubt, inconstancy, sadness, and\nsuch like, could not be found in God, since I myself would have been\nhappy to be free from them. Besides, I had ideas of many sensible and\ncorporeal things; for although I might suppose that I was dreaming, and\nthat all which I saw or imagined was false, I could not, nevertheless,\ndeny that the ideas were in reality in my thoughts. But, because I had\nalready very clearly recognized in myself that the intelligent nature\nis distinct from the corporeal, and as I observed that all composition\nis an evidence of dependency, and that a state of dependency is\nmanifestly a state of imperfection, I therefore determined that it\ncould not be a perfection in God to be compounded of these two natures\nand that consequently he was not so compounded; but that if there were\nany bodies in the world, or even any intelligences, or other natures\nthat were not wholly perfect, their existence depended on his power in\nsuch a way that they could not subsist without him for a single moment.\nI was disposed straightway to search for other truths and when I had\nrepresented to myself the object of the geometers, which I conceived to\nbe a continuous body or a space indefinitely extended in length,\nbreadth, and height or depth, divisible into divers parts which admit\nof different figures and sizes, and of being moved or transposed in all\nmanner of ways (for all this the geometers suppose to be in the object\nthey contemplate), I went over some of their simplest demonstrations.\nAnd, in the first place, I observed, that the great certitude which by\ncommon consent is accorded to these demonstrations, is founded solely\nupon this, that they are clearly conceived in accordance with the rules\nI have already laid down In the next place, I perceived that there was\nnothing at all in these demonstrations which could assure me of the\nexistence of their object: thus, for example, supposing a triangle to\nbe given, I distinctly perceived that its three angles were necessarily\nequal to two right angles, but I did not on that account perceive\nanything which could assure me that any triangle existed: while, on the\ncontrary, recurring to the examination of the idea of a Perfect Being,\nI found that the existence of the Being was comprised in the idea in\nthe same way that the equality of its three angles to two right angles\nis comprised in the idea of a triangle, or as in the idea of a sphere,\nthe equidistance of all points on its surface from the center, or even\nstill more clearly; and that consequently it is at least as certain\nthat God, who is this Perfect Being, is, or exists, as any\ndemonstration of geometry can be.\nBut the reason which leads many to persuade them selves that there is a\ndifficulty in knowing this truth, and even also in knowing what their\nmind really is, is that they never raise their thoughts above sensible\nobjects, and are so accustomed to consider nothing except by way of\nimagination, which is a mode of thinking limited to material objects,\nthat all that is not imaginable seems to them not intelligible. The\ntruth of this is sufficiently manifest from the single circumstance,\nthat the philosophers of the schools accept as a maxim that there is\nnothing in the understanding which was not previously in the senses, in\nwhich however it is certain that the ideas of God and of the soul have\nnever been; and it appears to me that they who make use of their\nimagination to comprehend these ideas do exactly the some thing as if,\nin order to hear sounds or smell odors, they strove to avail themselves\nof their eyes; unless indeed that there is this difference, that the\nsense of sight does not afford us an inferior assurance to those of\nsmell or hearing; in place of which, neither our imagination nor our\nsenses can give us assurance of anything unless our understanding\nintervene.\nFinally, if there be still persons who are not sufficiently persuaded\nof the existence of God and of the soul, by the reasons I have adduced,\nI am desirous that they should know that all the other propositions, of\nthe truth of which they deem themselves perhaps more assured, as that\nwe have a body, and that there exist stars and an earth, and such like,\nare less certain; for, although we have a moral assurance of these\nthings, which is so strong that there is an appearance of extravagance\nin doubting of their existence, yet at the same time no one, unless his\nintellect is impaired, can deny, when the question relates to a\nmetaphysical certitude, that there is sufficient reason to exclude\nentire assurance, in the observation that when asleep we can in the\nsame way imagine ourselves possessed of another body and that we see\nother stars and another earth, when there is nothing of the kind. For\nhow do we know that the thoughts which occur in dreaming are false\nrather than those other which we experience when awake, since the\nformer are often not less vivid and distinct than the latter? And\nthough men of the highest genius study this question as long as they\nplease, I do not believe that they will be able to give any reason\nwhich can be sufficient to remove this doubt, unless they presuppose\nthe existence of God. For, in the first place even the principle which\nI have already taken as a rule, viz., that all the things which we\nclearly and distinctly conceive are true, is certain only because God\nis or exists and because he is a Perfect Being, and because all that we\npossess is derived from him: whence it follows that our ideas or\nnotions, which to the extent of their clearness and distinctness are\nreal, and proceed from God, must to that extent be true. Accordingly,\nwhereas we not infrequently have ideas or notions in which some falsity\nis contained, this can only be the case with such as are to some extent\nconfused and obscure, and in this proceed from nothing (participate of\nnegation), that is, exist in us thus confused because we are not wholly\nperfect. And it is evident that it is not less repugnant that falsity\nor imperfection, in so far as it is imperfection, should proceed from\nGod, than that truth or perfection should proceed from nothing. But if\nwe did not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds\nfrom a Perfect and Infinite Being, however clear and distinct our ideas\nmight be, we should have no ground on that account for the assurance\nthat they possessed the perfection of being true.\nBut after the knowledge of God and of the soul has rendered us certain\nof this rule, we can easily understand that the truth of the thoughts\nwe experience when awake, ought not in the slightest degree to be\ncalled in question on account of the illusions of our dreams. For if it\nhappened that an individual, even when asleep, had some very distinct\nidea, as, for example, if a geometer should discover some new\ndemonstration, the circumstance of his being asleep would not militate\nagainst its truth; and as for the most ordinary error of our dreams,\nwhich consists in their representing to us various objects in the same\nway as our external senses, this is not prejudicial, since it leads us\nvery properly to suspect the truth of the ideas of sense; for we are\nnot infrequently deceived in the same manner when awake; as when\npersons in the jaundice see all objects yellow, or when the stars or\nbodies at a great distance appear to us much smaller than they are.\nFor, in fine, whether awake or asleep, we ought never to allow\nourselves to be persuaded of the truth of anything unless on the\nevidence of our reason. And it must be noted that I say of our reason,\nand not of our imagination or of our senses: thus, for example,\nalthough we very clearly see the sun, we ought not therefore to\ndetermine that it is only of the size which our sense of sight\npresents; and we may very distinctly imagine the head of a lion joined\nto the body of a goat, without being therefore shut up to the\nconclusion that a chimaera exists; for it is not a dictate of reason\nthat what we thus see or imagine is in reality existent; but it plainly\ntells us that all our ideas or notions contain in them some truth; for\notherwise it could not be that God, who is wholly perfect and\nveracious, should have placed them in us. And because our reasonings\nare never so clear or so complete during sleep as when we are awake,\nalthough sometimes the acts of our imagination are then as lively and\ndistinct, if not more so than in our waking moments, reason further\ndictates that, since all our thoughts cannot be true because of our\npartial imperfection, those possessing truth must infallibly be found\nin the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our\ndreams.\nPART V\nI would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of\ntruths which I deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it\nwould have been necessary now to treat of many questions in dispute\namong the earned, with whom I do not wish to be embroiled, I believe\nthat it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition, and only\nmention in general what these truths are, that the more judicious may\nbe able to determine whether a more special account of them would\nconduce to the public advantage. I have ever remained firm in my\noriginal resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which I\nhave recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of God and\nof the soul, and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me\nmore clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had\nformerly appeared; and yet I venture to state that not only have I\nfound means to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal\ndifficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy, but I have\nalso observed certain laws established in nature by God in such a\nmanner, and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions, that\nafter we have reflected sufficiently upon these, we cannot doubt that\nthey are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the\nworld and farther, by considering the concatenation of these laws, it\nappears to me that I have discovered many truths more useful and more\nimportant than all I had before learned, or even had expected to learn.\nBut because I have essayed to expound the chief of these discoveries in\na treatise which certain considerations prevent me from publishing, I\ncannot make the results known more conveniently than by here giving a\nsummary of the contents of this treatise. It was my design to comprise\nin it all that, before I set myself to write it, I thought I knew of\nthe nature of material objects. But like the painters who, finding\nthemselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the\ndifferent faces of a solid body, select one of the chief, on which\nalone they make the light fall, and throwing the rest into the shade,\nallow them to appear only in so far as they can be seen while looking\nat the principal one; so, fearing lest I should not be able to compense\nin my discourse all that was in my mind, I resolved to expound singly,\nthough at considerable length, my opinions regarding light; then to\ntake the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed\nstars, since light almost wholly proceeds from them; on the heavens\nsince they transmit it; on the planets, comets, and earth, since they\nreflect it; and particularly on all the bodies that are upon the earth,\nsince they are either colored, or transparent, or luminous; and finally\non man, since he is the spectator of these objects. Further, to enable\nme to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade, and to\nexpress my judgment regarding them with greater freedom, without being\nnecessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned, I resolved\nto leave all the people here to their disputes, and to speak only of\nwhat would happen in a new world, if God were now to create somewhere\nin the imaginary spaces matter sufficient to compose one, and were to\nagitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter, so\nthat there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned,\nand after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to\nnature, and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had\nestablished. On this supposition, I, in the first place, described this\nmatter, and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my mind\nthere can be nothing clearer and more intelligible, except what has\nbeen recently said regarding God and the soul; for I even expressly\nsupposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are\nso debated in the schools, nor in general anything the knowledge of\nwhich is not so natural to our minds that no one can so much as imagine\nhimself ignorant of it. Besides, I have pointed out what are the laws\nof nature; and, with no other principle upon which to found my\nreasonings except the infinite perfection of God, I endeavored to\ndemonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt,\nand to prove that they are such, that even if God had created more\nworlds, there could have been none in which these laws were not\nobserved. Thereafter, I showed how the greatest part of the matter of\nthis chaos must, in accordance with these laws, dispose and arrange\nitself in such a way as to present the appearance of heavens; how in\nthe meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets\nand comets, and others a sun and fixed stars. And, making a digression\nat this stage on the subject of light, I expounded at considerable\nlength what the nature of that light must be which is found in the sun\nand the stars, and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the\nimmense spaces of the heavens, and how from the planets and comets it\nis reflected towards the earth. To this I likewise added much\nrespecting the substance, the situation, the motions, and all the\ndifferent qualities of these heavens and stars; so that I thought I had\nsaid enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in\nthe heavens or stars of our system that must not, or at least may not\nappear precisely alike in those of the system which I described. I came\nnext to speak of the earth in particular, and to show how, even though\nI had expressly supposed that God had given no weight to the matter of\nwhich it is composed, this should not prevent all its parts from\ntending exactly to its center; how with water and air on its surface,\nthe disposition of the heavens and heavenly bodies, more especially of\nthe moon, must cause a flow and ebb, like in all its circumstances to\nthat observed in our seas, as also a certain current both of water and\nair from east to west, such as is likewise observed between the\ntropics; how the mountains, seas, fountains, and rivers might naturally\nbe formed in it, and the metals produced in the mines, and the plants\ngrow in the fields and in general, how all the bodies which are\ncommonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and, among\nother things in the discoveries alluded to inasmuch as besides the\nstars, I knew nothing except fire which produces light, I spared no\npains to set forth all that pertains to its nature,--the manner of its\nproduction and support, and to explain how heat is sometimes found\nwithout light, and light without heat; to show how it can induce\nvarious colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities; how\nit reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others; how it can\nconsume almost all bodies, or convert them into ashes and smoke; and\nfinally, how from these ashes, by the mere intensity of its action, it\nforms glass: for as this transmutation of ashes into glass appeared to\nme as wonderful as any other in nature, I took a special pleasure in\ndescribing it. I was not, however, disposed, from these circumstances,\nto conclude that this world had been created in the manner I described;\nfor it is much more likely that God made it at the first such as it was\nto be. But this is certain, and an opinion commonly received among\ntheologians, that the action by which he now sustains it is the same\nwith that by which he originally created it; so that even although he\nhad from the beginning given it no other form than that of chaos,\nprovided only he had established certain laws of nature, and had lent\nit his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do, it may be\nbelieved, without discredit to the miracle of creation, that, in this\nway alone, things purely material might, in course of time, have become\nsuch as we observe them at present; and their nature is much more\neasily conceived when they are beheld coming in this manner gradually\ninto existence, than when they are only considered as produced at once\nin a finished and perfect state.\nFrom the description of inanimate bodies and plants, I passed to\nanimals, and particularly to man. But since I had not as yet sufficient\nknowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the\nrest, that is to say, by deducing effects from their causes, and by\nshowing from what elements and in what manner nature must produce them,\nI remained satisfied with the supposition that God formed the body of\nman wholly like to one of ours, as well in the external shape of the\nmembers as in the internal conformation of the organs, of the same\nmatter with that I had described, and at first placed in it no rational\nsoul, nor any other principle, in room of the vegetative or sensitive\nsoul, beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light,\nsuch as I had already described, and which I thought was not different\nfrom the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry, or\nthat which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear\nof the fruit. For, when I examined the kind of functions which might,\nas consequences of this supposition, exist in this body, I found\nprecisely all those which may exist in us independently of all power of\nthinking, and consequently without being in any measure owing to the\nsoul; in other words, to that part of us which is distinct from the\nbody, and of which it has been said above that the nature distinctively\nconsists in thinking, functions in which the animals void of reason may\nbe said wholly to resemble us; but among which I could not discover any\nof those that, as dependent on thought alone, belong to us as men,\nwhile, on the other hand, I did afterwards discover these as soon as I\nsupposed God to have created a rational soul, and to have annexed it to\nthis body in a particular manner which I described.\nBut, in order to show how I there handled this matter, I mean here to\ngive the explication of the motion of the heart and arteries, which, as\nthe first and most general motion observed in animals, will afford the\nmeans of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest.\nAnd that there may be less difficulty in understanding what I am about\nto say on this subject, I advise those who are not versed in anatomy,\nbefore they commence the perusal of these observations, to take the\ntrouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large\nanimal possessed of lungs (for this is throughout sufficiently like the\nhuman), and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities: in\nthe first place, that in the right side, with which correspond two very\nample tubes, viz., the hollow vein (_vena cava_), which is the\nprincipal receptacle of the blood, and the trunk of the tree, as it\nwere, of which all the other veins in the body are branches; and the\narterial vein (_vena arteriosa_), inappropriately so denominated, since\nit is in truth only an artery, which, taking its rise in the heart, is\ndivided, after passing out from it, into many branches which presently\ndisperse themselves all over the lungs; in the second place, the cavity\nin the left side, with which correspond in the same manner two canals\nin size equal to or larger than the preceding, viz., the venous artery\n(_arteria venosa_), likewise inappropriately thus designated, because\nit is simply a vein which comes from the lungs, where it is divided\ninto many branches, interlaced with those of the arterial vein, and\nthose of the tube called the windpipe, through which the air we breathe\nenters; and the great artery which, issuing from the heart, sends its\nbranches all over the body. I should wish also that such persons were\ncarefully shown the eleven pellicles which, like so many small valves,\nopen and shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities, viz.,\nthree at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in\nsuch a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains\nfrom flowing into the right ventricle of the heart, and yet exactly to\nprevent its flowing out; three at the entrance to the arterial vein,\nwhich, arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former, readily\npermit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs, but\nhinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity; and,\nin like manner, two others at the mouth of the venous artery, which\nallow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the\nheart, but preclude its return; and three at the mouth of the great\nartery, which suffer the blood to flow from the heart, but prevent its\nreflux. Nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these\npellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an\noval shape from the nature of its situation, can be adequately closed\nwith two, whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed\nwith three. Besides, I wish such persons to observe that the grand\nartery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture than\nthe venous artery and the hollow vein; and that the two last expand\nbefore entering the heart, and there form, as it were, two pouches\ndenominated the auricles of the heart, which are composed of a\nsubstance similar to that of the heart itself; and that there is always\nmore warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body--and\nfinally, that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that\npasses into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate, just as all\nliquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated\nvessel.\nFor, after these things, it is not necessary for me to say anything\nmore with a view to explain the motion of the heart, except that when\nits cavities are not full of blood, into these the blood of necessity\nflows,--from the hollow vein into the right, and from the venous artery\ninto the left; because these two vessels are always full of blood, and\ntheir orifices, which are turned towards the heart, cannot then be\nclosed. But as soon as two drops of blood have thus passed, one into\neach of the cavities, these drops which cannot but be very large,\nbecause the orifices through which they pass are wide, and the vessels\nfrom which they come full of blood, are immediately rarefied, and\ndilated by the heat they meet with. In this way they cause the whole\nheart to expand, and at the same time press home and shut the five\nsmall valves that are at the entrances of the two vessels from which\nthey flow, and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the\nheart, and becoming more and more rarefied, they push open the six\nsmall valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels, through\nwhich they pass out, causing in this way all the branches of the\narterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously\nwith the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract, as do\nalso the arteries, because the blood that has entered them has cooled,\nand the six small valves close, and the five of the hollow vein and of\nthe venous artery open anew and allow a passage to other two drops of\nblood, which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as\nbefore. And, because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes\nthrough these two pouches called auricles, it thence happens that their\nmotion is the contrary of that of the heart, and that when it expands\nthey contract. But lest those who are ignorant of the force of\nmathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish\ntrue reasons from mere verisimilitudes, should venture, without\nexamination, to deny what has been said, I wish it to be considered\nthat the motion which I have now explained follows as necessarily from\nthe very arrangement of the parts, which may be observed in the heart\nby the eye alone, and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers,\nand from the nature of the blood as learned from experience, as does\nthe motion of a clock from the power, the situation, and shape of its\ncounterweights and wheels.\nBut if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins, flowing\nin this way continually into the heart, is not exhausted, and why the\narteries do not become too full, since all the blood which passes\nthrough the heart flows into them, I need only mention in reply what\nhas been written by a physician of England, who has the honor of having\nbroken the ice on this subject, and of having been the first to teach\nthat there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries,\nthrough which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the\nsmall branches of the veins, whence it again returns to the heart; so\nthat its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation. Of this\nwe have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons, who, by\nbinding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where\nthey open the vein, cause the blood to flow more copiously than it\nwould have done without any ligature; whereas quite the contrary would\nhappen were they to bind it below; that is, between the hand and the\nopening, or were to make the ligature above the opening very tight. For\nit is manifest that the tie, moderately straightened, while adequate to\nhinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by\nthe veins, cannot on that account prevent new blood from coming forward\nthrough the arteries, because these are situated below the veins, and\ntheir coverings, from their greater consistency, are more difficult to\ncompress; and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to\npass through them to the hand with greater force than it does to return\nfrom the hand to the heart through the veins. And since the latter\ncurrent escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins,\nthere must of necessity be certain passages below the ligature, that\nis, towards the extremities of the arm through which it can come\nthither from the arteries. This physician likewise abundantly\nestablishes what he has advanced respecting the motion of the blood,\nfrom the existence of certain pellicles, so disposed in various places\nalong the course of the veins, in the manner of small valves, as not to\npermit the blood to pass from the middle of the body towards the\nextremities, but only to return from the extremities to the heart; and\nfarther, from experience which shows that all the blood which is in the\nbody may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery\nthat has been cut, even although this had been closely tied in the\nimmediate neighborhood of the heart and cut between the heart and the\nligature, so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out\nof it could come from any other quarter than the heart.\nBut there are many other circumstances which evince that what I have\nalleged is the true cause of the motion of the blood: thus, in the\nfirst place, the difference that is observed between the blood which\nflows from the veins, and that from the arteries, can only arise from\nthis, that being rarefied, and, as it were, distilled by passing\nthrough the heart, it is thinner, and more vivid, and warmer\nimmediately after leaving the heart, in other words, when in the\narteries, than it was a short time before passing into either, in other\nwords, when it was in the veins; and if attention be given, it will be\nfound that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of\nthe heart; and is not so evident in parts more remote from it. In the\nnext place, the consistency of the coats of which the arterial vein and\nthe great artery are composed, sufficiently shows that the blood is\nimpelled against them with more force than against the veins. And why\nshould the left cavity of the heart and the great artery be wider and\nlarger than the right cavity and the arterial vein, were it not that\nthe blood of the venous artery, having only been in the lungs after it\nhas passed through the heart, is thinner, and rarefies more readily,\nand in a higher degree, than the blood which proceeds immediately from\nthe hollow vein? And what can physicians conjecture from feeling the\npulse unless they know that according as the blood changes its nature\nit can be rarefied by the warmth of the heart, in a higher or lower\ndegree, and more or less quickly than before? And if it be inquired how\nthis heat is communicated to the other members, must it not be admitted\nthat this is effected by means of the blood, which, passing through the\nheart, is there heated anew, and thence diffused over all the body?\nWhence it happens, that if the blood be withdrawn from any part, the\nheat is likewise withdrawn by the same means; and although the heart\nwere as-hot as glowing iron, it would not be capable of warming the\nfeet and hands as at present, unless it continually sent thither new\nblood. We likewise perceive from this, that the true use of respiration\nis to bring sufficient fresh air into the lungs, to cause the blood\nwhich flows into them from the right ventricle of the heart, where it\nhas been rarefied and, as it were, changed into vapors, to become\nthick, and to convert it anew into blood, before it flows into the left\ncavity, without which process it would be unfit for the nourishment of\nthe fire that is there. This receives confirmation from the\ncircumstance, that it is observed of animals destitute of lungs that\nthey have also but one cavity in the heart, and that in children who\ncannot use them while in the womb, there is a hole through which the\nblood flows from the hollow vein into the left cavity of the heart, and\na tube through which it passes from the arterial vein into the grand\nartery without passing through the lung. In the next place, how could\ndigestion be carried on in the stomach unless the heart communicated\nheat to it through the arteries, and along with this certain of the\nmore fluid parts of the blood, which assist in the dissolution of the\nfood that has been taken in? Is not also the operation which converts\nthe juice of food into blood easily comprehended, when it is considered\nthat it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps\nmore than one or two hundred times in a day? And what more need be\nadduced to explain nutrition, and the production of the different\nhumors of the body, beyond saying, that the force with which the blood,\nin being rarefied, passes from the heart towards the extremities of the\narteries, causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which\nthey arrive, and there occupy the place of some others expelled by\nthem; and that according to the situation, shape, or smallness of the\npores with which they meet, some rather than others flow into certain\nparts, in the same way that some sieves are observed to act, which, by\nbeing variously perforated, serve to separate different species of\ngrain? And, in the last place, what above all is here worthy of\nobservation, is the generation of the animal spirits, which are like a\nvery subtle wind, or rather a very pure and vivid flame which,\ncontinually ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain,\nthence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles, and gives motion\nto all the members; so that to account for other parts of the blood\nwhich, as most agitated and penetrating, are the fittest to compose\nthese spirits, proceeding towards the brain, it is not necessary to\nsuppose any other cause, than simply, that the arteries which carry\nthem thither proceed from the heart in the most direct lines, and that,\naccording to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of\nnature, when many objects tend at once to the same point where there is\nnot sufficient room for all (as is the case with the parts of the blood\nwhich flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the\nbrain), the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven\naside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it\nI had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the\ntreatise which I formerly thought of publishing. And after these, I had\nshown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscles of the human\nbody to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the\nmembers, as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off\nstill move and bite the earth, although no longer animated; what\nchanges must take place in the brain to produce waking, sleep, and\ndreams; how light, sounds, odors, tastes, heat, and all the other\nqualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means\nof the senses; how hunger, thirst, and the other internal affections\ncan likewise impress upon it divers ideas; what must be understood by\nthe common sense (_sensus communis_) in which these ideas are received,\nby the memory which retains them, by the fantasy which can change them\nin various ways, and out of them compose new ideas, and which, by the\nsame means, distributing the animal spirits through the muscles, can\ncause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways, and\nin a manner as suited, whether to the objects that are presented to its\nsenses or to its internal affections, as can take place in our own case\napart from the guidance of the will. Nor will this appear at all\nstrange to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements\nperformed by the different automata, or moving machines fabricated by\nhuman industry, and that with help of but few pieces compared with the\ngreat multitude of bones, muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and other\nparts that are found in the body of each animal. Such persons will look\nupon this body as a machine made by the hands of God, which is\nincomparably better arranged, and adequate to movements more admirable\nthan is any machine of human invention. And here I specially stayed to\nshow that, were there such machines exactly resembling organs and\noutward form an ape or any other irrational animal, we could have no\nmeans of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature\nfrom these animals; but if there were machines bearing the image of our\nbodies, and capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally\npossible, there would still remain two most certain tests whereby to\nknow that they were not therefore really men. Of these the first is\nthat they could never use words or other signs arranged in such a\nmanner as is competent to us in order to declare our thoughts to\nothers: for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that\nit emits vocables, and even that it emits some correspondent to the\naction upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs;\nfor example, if touched in a particular place it may demand what we\nwish to say to it; if in another it may cry out that it is hurt, and\nsuch like; but not that it should arrange them variously so as\nappositely to reply to what is said in its presence, as men of the\nlowest grade of intellect can do. The second test is, that although\nsuch machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater\nperfection than any of us, they would, without doubt, fail in certain\nothers from which it could be discovered that they did not act from\nknowledge, but solely from the disposition of their organs: for while\nreason is an universal instrument that is alike available on every\noccasion, these organs, on the contrary, need a particular arrangement\nfor each particular action; whence it must be morally impossible that\nthere should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient to\nenable it to act in all the occurrences of life, in the way in which\nour reason enables us to act. Again, by means of these two tests we may\nlikewise know the difference between men and brutes. For it is highly\ndeserving of remark, that there are no men so dull and stupid, not even\nidiots, as to be incapable of joining together different words, and\nthereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts\nunderstood; and that on the other hand, there is no other animal,\nhowever perfect or happily circumstanced, which can do the like. Nor\ndoes this inability arise from want of organs: for we observe that\nmagpies and parrots can utter words like ourselves, and are yet unable\nto speak as we do, that is, so as to show that they understand what\nthey say; in place of which men born deaf and dumb, and thus not less,\nbut rather more than the brutes, destitute of the organs which others\nuse in speaking, are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain\nsigns by which they discover their thoughts to those who, being usually\nin their company, have leisure to learn their language. And this proves\nnot only that the brutes have less reason than man, but that they have\nnone at all: for we see that very little is required to enable a person\nto speak; and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable\namong animals of the same species, as well as among men, and since some\nare more capable of being instructed than others, it is incredible that\nthe most perfect ape or parrot of its species, should not in this be\nequal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was\ncrack-brained, unless the soul of brutes were of a nature wholly\ndifferent from ours. And we ought not to confound speech with the\nnatural movements which indicate the passions, and can be imitated by\nmachines as well as manifested by animals; nor must it be thought with\ncertain of the ancients, that the brutes speak, although we do not\nunderstand their language. For if such were the case, since they are\nendowed with many organs analogous to ours, they could as easily\ncommunicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows. It is also very\nworthy of remark, that, though there are many animals which manifest\nmore industry than we in certain of their actions, the same animals are\nyet observed to show none at all in many others: so that the\ncircumstance that they do better than we does not prove that they are\nendowed with mind, for it would thence follow that they possessed\ngreater reason than any of us, and could surpass us in all things; on\nthe contrary, it rather proves that they are destitute of reason, and\nthat it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of\ntheir organs: thus it is seen, that a clock composed only of wheels and\nweights can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with\nall our skin.\nI had after this described the reasonable soul, and shown that it could\nby no means be educed from the power of matter, as the other things of\nwhich I had spoken, but that it must be expressly created; and that it\nis not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a\npilot in a ship, unless perhaps to move its members, but that it is\nnecessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body, in\norder to have sensations and appetites similar to ours, and thus\nconstitute a real man. I here entered, in conclusion, upon the subject\nof the soul at considerable length, because it is of the greatest\nmoment: for after the error of those who deny the existence of God, an\nerror which I think I have already sufficiently refuted, there is none\nthat is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight\npath of virtue than the supposition that the soul of the brutes is of\nthe same nature with our own; and consequently that after this life we\nhave nothing to hope for or fear, more than flies and ants; in place of\nwhich, when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the\nreasons which establish that the soul is of a nature wholly independent\nof the body, and that consequently it is not liable to die with the\nlatter and, finally, because no other causes are observed capable of\ndestroying it, we are naturally led thence to judge that it is\nimmortal.\nPART VI\nThree years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise containing\nall these matters; and I was beginning to revise it, with the view to\nput it into the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom\nI greatly defer, and whose authority over my actions is hardly less\ninfluential than is my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a\ncertain doctrine in physics, published a short time previously by\nanother individual to which I will not say that I adhered, but only\nthat, previously to their censure I had observed in it nothing which I\ncould imagine to be prejudicial either to religion or to the state, and\nnothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression\nto it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; and this led\nme to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found\nin which I had departed from the truth, notwithstanding the great care\nI have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had\nnot the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to\naught that might tend to the hurt of any one. This has been sufficient\nto make me alter my purpose of publishing them; for although the\nreasons by which I had been induced to take this resolution were very\nstrong, yet my inclination, which has always been hostile to writing\nbooks, enabled me immediately to discover other considerations\nsufficient to excuse me for not undertaking the task. And these\nreasons, on one side and the other, are such, that not only is it in\nsome measure my interest here to state them, but that of the public,\nperhaps, to know them.\nI have never made much account of what has proceeded from my own mind;\nand so long as I gathered no other advantage from the method I employ\nbeyond satisfying myself on some difficulties belonging to the\nspeculative sciences, or endeavoring to regulate my actions according\nto the principles it taught me, I never thought myself bound to publish\nanything respecting it. For in what regards manners, every one is so\nfull of his own wisdom, that there might be found as many reformers as\nheads, if any were allowed to take upon themselves the task of mending\nthem, except those whom God has constituted the supreme rulers of his\npeople or to whom he has given sufficient grace and zeal to be\nprophets; and although my speculations greatly pleased myself, I\nbelieved that others had theirs, which perhaps pleased them still more.\nBut as soon as I had acquired some general notions respecting physics,\nand beginning to make trial of them in various particular difficulties,\nhad observed how far they can carry us, and how much they differ from\nthe principles that have been employed up to the present time, I\nbelieved that I could not keep them concealed without sinning\ngrievously against the law by which we are bound to promote, as far as\nin us lies, the general good of mankind. For by them I perceived it to\nbe possible to arrive at knowledge highly useful in life; and in room\nof the speculative philosophy usually taught in the schools, to\ndiscover a practical, by means of which, knowing the force and action\nof fire, water, air the stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies\nthat surround us, as distinctly as we know the various crafts of our\nartisans, we might also apply them in the same way to all the uses to\nwhich they are adapted, and thus render ourselves the lords and\npossessors of nature. And this is a result to be desired, not only in\norder to the invention of an infinity of arts, by which we might be\nenabled to enjoy without any trouble the fruits of the earth, and all\nits comforts, but also and especially for the preservation of health,\nwhich is without doubt, of all the blessings of this life, the first\nand fundamental one; for the mind is so intimately dependent upon the\ncondition and relation of the organs of the body, that if any means can\never be found to render men wiser and more ingenious than hitherto, I\nbelieve that it is in medicine they must be sought for. It is true that\nthe science of medicine, as it now exists, contains few things whose\nutility is very remarkable: but without any wish to depreciate it, I am\nconfident that there is no one, even among those whose profession it\nis, who does not admit that all at present known in it is almost\nnothing in comparison of what remains to be discovered; and that we\ncould free ourselves from an infinity of maladies of body as well as of\nmind, and perhaps also even from the debility of age, if we had\nsufficiently ample knowledge of their causes, and of all the remedies\nprovided for us by nature. But since I designed to employ my whole life\nin the search after so necessary a science, and since I had fallen in\nwith a path which seems to me such, that if any one follow it he must\ninevitably reach the end desired, unless he be hindered either by the\nshortness of life or the want of experiments, I judged that there could\nbe no more effectual provision against these two impediments than if I\nwere faithfully to communicate to the public all the little I might\nmyself have found, and incite men of superior genius to strive to\nproceed farther, by contributing, each according to his inclination and\nability, to the experiments which it would be necessary to make, and\nalso by informing the public of all they might discover, so that, by\nthe last beginning where those before them had left off, and thus\nconnecting the lives and labours of many, we might collectively proceed\nmuch farther than each by himself could do.\nI remarked, moreover, with respect to experiments, that they become\nalways more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge; for, at\nthe commencement, it is better to make use only of what is\nspontaneously presented to our senses, and of which we cannot remain\nignorant, provided we bestow on it any reflection, however slight, than\nto concern ourselves about more uncommon and recondite phenomena: the\nreason of which is, that the more uncommon often only mislead us so\nlong as the causes of the more ordinary are still unknown; and the\ncircumstances upon which they depend are almost always so special and\nminute as to be highly difficult to detect. But in this I have adopted\nthe following order: first, I have essayed to find in general the\nprinciples, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world,\nwithout taking into consideration for this end anything but God himself\nwho has created it, and without educing them from any other source than\nfrom certain germs of truths naturally existing in our minds In the\nsecond place, I examined what were the first and most ordinary effects\nthat could be deduced from these causes; and it appears to me that, in\nthis way, I have found heavens, stars, an earth, and even on the earth\nwater, air, fire, minerals, and some other things of this kind, which\nof all others are the most common and simple, and hence the easiest to\nknow. Afterwards when I wished to descend to the more particular, so\nmany diverse objects presented themselves to me, that I believed it to\nbe impossible for the human mind to distinguish the forms or species of\nbodies that are upon the earth, from an infinity of others which might\nhave been, if it had pleased God to place them there, or consequently\nto apply them to our use, unless we rise to causes through their\neffects, and avail ourselves of many particular experiments. Thereupon,\nturning over in my mind I the objects that had ever been presented to\nmy senses I freely venture to state that I have never observed any\nwhich I could not satisfactorily explain by the principles had\ndiscovered. But it is necessary also to confess that the power of\nnature is so ample and vast, and these principles so simple and\ngeneral, that I have hardly observed a single particular effect which I\ncannot at once recognize as capable of being deduced in man different\nmodes from the principles, and that my greatest difficulty usually is\nto discover in which of these modes the effect is dependent upon them;\nfor out of this difficulty cannot otherwise extricate myself than by\nagain seeking certain experiments, which may be such that their result\nis not the same, if it is in the one of these modes at we must explain\nit, as it would be if it were to be explained in the other. As to what\nremains, I am now in a position to discern, as I think, with sufficient\nclearness what course must be taken to make the majority those\nexperiments which may conduce to this end: but I perceive likewise that\nthey are such and so numerous, that neither my hands nor my income,\nthough it were a thousand times larger than it is, would be sufficient\nfor them all; so that according as henceforward I shall have the means\nof making more or fewer experiments, I shall in the same proportion\nmake greater or less progress in the knowledge of nature. This was what\nI had hoped to make known by the treatise I had written, and so clearly\nto exhibit the advantage that would thence accrue to the public, as to\ninduce all who have the common good of man at heart, that is, all who\nare virtuous in truth, and not merely in appearance, or according to\nopinion, as well to communicate to me the experiments they had already\nmade, as to assist me in those that remain to be made.\nBut since that time other reasons have occurred to me, by which I have\nbeen led to change my opinion, and to think that I ought indeed to go\non committing to writing all the results which I deemed of any moment,\nas soon as I should have tested their truth, and to bestow the same\ncare upon them as I would have done had it been my design to publish\nthem. This course commended itself to me, as well because I thus\nafforded myself more ample inducement to examine them thoroughly, for\ndoubtless that is always more narrowly scrutinized which we believe\nwill be read by many, than that which is written merely for our private\nuse (and frequently what has seemed to me true when I first conceived\nit, has appeared false when I have set about committing it to writing),\nas because I thus lost no opportunity of advancing the interests of the\npublic, as far as in me lay, and since thus likewise, if my writings\npossess any value, those into whose hands they may fall after my death\nmay be able to put them to what use they deem proper. But I resolved by\nno means to consent to their publication during my lifetime, lest\neither the oppositions or the controversies to which they might give\nrise, or even the reputation, such as it might be, which they would\nacquire for me, should be any occasion of my losing the time that I had\nset apart for my own improvement. For though it be true that every one\nis bound to promote to the extent of his ability the good of others,\nand that to be useful to no one is really to be worthless, yet it is\nlikewise true that our cares ought to extend beyond the present, and it\nis good to omit doing what might perhaps bring some profit to the\nliving, when we have in view the accomplishment of other ends that will\nbe of much greater advantage to posterity. And in truth, I am quite\nwilling it should be known that the little I have hitherto learned is\nalmost nothing in comparison with that of which I am ignorant, and to\nthe knowledge of which I do not despair of being able to attain; for it\nis much the same with those who gradually discover truth in the\nsciences, as with those who when growing rich find less difficulty in\nmaking great acquisitions, than they formerly experienced when poor in\nmaking acquisitions of much smaller amount. Or they may be compared to\nthe commanders of armies, whose forces usually increase in proportion\nto their victories, and who need greater prudence to keep together the\nresidue of their troops after a defeat than after a victory to take\ntowns and provinces. For he truly engages in battle who endeavors to\nsurmount all the difficulties and errors which prevent him from\nreaching the knowledge of truth, and he is overcome in fight who admits\na false opinion touching a matter of any generality and importance, and\nhe requires thereafter much more skill to recover his former position\nthan to make great advances when once in possession of thoroughly\nascertained principles. As for myself, if I have succeeded in\ndiscovering any truths in the sciences (and I trust that what is\ncontained in this volume I will show that I have found some), I can\ndeclare that they are but the consequences and results of five or six\nprincipal difficulties which I have surmounted, and my encounters with\nwhich I reckoned as battles in which victory declared for me. I will\nnot hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to\nenable me fully to realize my designs than to gain two or three similar\nvictories; and that I am not so far advanced in years but that,\naccording to the ordinary course of nature, I may still have sufficient\nleisure for this end. But I conceive myself the more bound to husband\nthe time that remains the greater my expectation of being able to\nemploy it aright, and I should doubtless have much to rob me of it,\nwere I to publish the principles of my physics: for although they are\nalmost all so evident that to assent to them no more is needed than\nsimply to understand them, and although there is not one of them of\nwhich I do not expect to be able to give demonstration, yet, as it is\nimpossible that they can be in accordance with all the diverse opinions\nof others, I foresee that I should frequently be turned aside from my\ngrand design, on occasion of the opposition which they would be sure to\nawaken.\nIt may be said, that these oppositions would be useful both in making\nme aware of my errors, and, if my speculations contain anything of\nvalue, in bringing others to a fuller understanding of it; and still\nfarther, as many can see better than one, in leading others who are now\nbeginning to avail themselves of my principles, to assist me in turn\nwith their discoveries. But though I recognize my extreme liability to\nerror, and scarce ever trust to the first thoughts which occur to me,\nyet-the experience I have had of possible objections to my views\nprevents me from anticipating any profit from them. For I have already\nhad frequent proof of the judgments, as well of those I esteemed\nfriends, as of some others to whom I thought I was an object of\nindifference, and even of some whose malignancy and envy would, I knew,\ndetermine them to endeavor to discover what partiality concealed from\nthe eyes of my friends. But it has rarely happened that anything has\nbeen objected to me which I had myself altogether overlooked, unless it\nwere something far removed from the subject: so that I have never met\nwith a single critic of my opinions who did not appear to me either\nless rigorous or less equitable than myself. And further, I have never\nobserved that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the\ndisputations that are practised in the schools; for while each strives\nfor the victory, each is much more occupied in making the best of mere\nverisimilitude, than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the\nquestion; and those who have been long good advocates are not\nafterwards on that account the better judges.\nAs for the advantage that others would derive from the communication of\nmy thoughts, it could not be very great; because I have not yet so far\nprosecuted them as that much does not remain to be added before they\ncan be applied to practice. And I think I may say without vanity, that\nif there is any one who can carry them out that length, it must be\nmyself rather than another: not that there may not be in the world many\nminds incomparably superior to mine, but because one cannot so well\nseize a thing and make it one\u2019s own, when it has been learned from\nanother, as when one has himself discovered it. And so true is this of\nthe present subject that, though I have often explained some of my\nopinions to persons of much acuteness, who, whilst I was speaking,\nappeared to understand them very distinctly, yet, when they repeated\nthem, I have observed that they almost always changed them to such an\nextent that I could no longer acknowledge them as mine. I am glad, by\nthe way, to take this opportunity of requesting posterity never to\nbelieve on hearsay that anything has proceeded from me which has not\nbeen published by myself; and I am not at all astonished at the\nextravagances attributed to those ancient philosophers whose own\nwritings we do not possess; whose thoughts, however, I do not on that\naccount suppose to have been really absurd, seeing they were among the\nablest men of their times, but only that these have been falsely\nrepresented to us. It is observable, accordingly, that scarcely in a\nsingle instance has any one of their disciples surpassed them; and I am\nquite sure that the most devoted of the present followers of Aristotle\nwould think themselves happy if they had as much knowledge of nature as\nhe possessed, were it even under the condition that they should never\nafterwards attain to higher. In this respect they are like the ivy\nwhich never strives to rise above the tree that sustains it, and which\nfrequently even returns downwards when it has reached the top; for it\nseems to me that they also sink, in other words, render themselves less\nwise than they would be if they gave up study, who, not contented with\nknowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, desire in\naddition to find in him the solution of many difficulties of which he\nsays not a word, and never perhaps so much as thought. Their fashion of\nphilosophizing, however, is well suited to persons whose abilities fall\nbelow mediocrity; for the obscurity of the distinctions and principles\nof which they make use enables them to speak of all things with as much\nconfidence as if they really knew them, and to defend all that they say\non any subject against the most subtle and skillful, without its being\npossible for any one to convict them of error. In this they seem to me\nto be like a blind man, who, in order to fight on equal terms with a\nperson that sees, should have made him descend to the bottom of an\nintensely dark cave: and I may say that such persons have an interest\nin my refraining from publishing the principles of the philosophy of\nwhich I make use; for, since these are of a kind the simplest and most\nevident, I should, by publishing them, do much the same as if I were to\nthrow open the windows, and allow the light of day to enter the cave\ninto which the combatants had descended. But even superior men have no\nreason for any great anxiety to know these principles, for if what they\ndesire is to be able to speak of all things, and to acquire a\nreputation for learning, they will gain their end more easily by\nremaining satisfied with the appearance of truth, which can be found\nwithout much difficulty in all sorts of matters, than by seeking the\ntruth itself which unfolds itself but slowly and that only in some\ndepartments, while it obliges us, when we have to speak of others,\nfreely to confess our ignorance. If, however, they prefer the knowledge\nof some few truths to the vanity of appearing ignorant of none, as such\nknowledge is undoubtedly much to be preferred, and, if they choose to\nfollow a course similar to mine, they do not require for this that I\nshould say anything more than I have already said in this discourse.\nFor if they are capable of making greater advancement than I have made,\nthey will much more be able of themselves to discover all that I\nbelieve myself to have found; since as I have never examined aught\nexcept in order, it is certain that what yet remains to be discovered\nis in itself more difficult and recondite, than that which I have\nalready been enabled to find, and the gratification would be much less\nin learning it from me than in discovering it for themselves. Besides\nthis, the habit which they will acquire, by seeking first what is easy,\nand then passing onward slowly and step by step to the more difficult,\nwill benefit them more than all my instructions. Thus, in my own case,\nI am persuaded that if I had been taught from my youth all the truths\nof which I have since sought out demonstrations, and had thus learned\nthem without labour, I should never, perhaps, have known any beyond\nthese; at least, I should never have acquired the habit and the\nfacility which I think I possess in always discovering new truths in\nproportion as I give myself to the search. And, in a single word, if\nthere is any work in the world which cannot be so well finished by\nanother as by him who has commenced it, it is that at which I labour.\nIt is true, indeed, as regards the experiments which may conduce to\nthis end, that one man is not equal to the task of making them all; but\nyet he can advantageously avail himself, in this work, of no hands\nbesides his own, unless those of artisans, or parties of the same kind,\nwhom he could pay, and whom the hope of gain (a means of great\nefficacy) might stimulate to accuracy in the performance of what was\nprescribed to them. For as to those who, through curiosity or a desire\nof learning, of their own accord, perhaps, offer him their services,\nbesides that in general their promises exceed their performance, and\nthat they sketch out fine designs of which not one is ever realized,\nthey will, without doubt, expect to be compensated for their trouble by\nthe explication of some difficulties, or, at least, by compliments and\nuseless speeches, in which he cannot spend any portion of his time\nwithout loss to himself. And as for the experiments that others have\nalready made, even although these parties should be willing of\nthemselves to communicate them to him (which is what those who esteem\nthem secrets will never do), the experiments are, for the most part,\naccompanied with so many circumstances and superfluous elements, as to\nmake it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the truth from its\nadjuncts--besides, he will find almost all of them so ill described, or\neven so false (because those who made them have wished to see in them\nonly such facts as they deemed conformable to their principles), that,\nif in the entire number there should be some of a nature suited to his\npurpose, still their value could not compensate for the time what would\nbe necessary to make the selection. So that if there existed any one\nwhom we assuredly knew to be capable of making discoveries of the\nhighest kind, and of the greatest possible utility to the public; and\nif all other men were therefore eager by all means to assist him in\nsuccessfully prosecuting his designs, I do not see that they could do\naught else for him beyond contributing to defray the expenses of the\nexperiments that might be necessary; and for the rest, prevent his\nbeing deprived of his leisure by the unseasonable interruptions of any\none. But besides that I neither have so high an opinion of myself as to\nbe willing to make promise of anything extraordinary, nor feed on\nimaginations so vain as to fancy that the public must be much\ninterested in my designs; I do not, on the other hand, own a soul so\nmean as to be capable of accepting from any one a favor of which it\ncould be supposed that I was unworthy.\nThese considerations taken together were the reason why, for the last\nthree years, I have been unwilling to publish the treatise I had on\nhand, and why I even resolved to give publicity during my life to no\nother that was so general, or by which the principles of my physics\nmight be understood. But since then, two other reasons have come into\noperation that have determined me here to subjoin some particular\nspecimens, and give the public some account of my doings and designs.\nOf these considerations, the first is, that if I failed to do so, many\nwho were cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writings,\nmight have imagined that the reasons which induced me to refrain from\nso doing, were less to my credit than they really are; for although I\nam not immoderately desirous of glory, or even, if I may venture so to\nsay, although I am averse from it in so far as I deem it hostile to\nrepose which I hold in greater account than aught else, yet, at the\nsame time, I have never sought to conceal my actions as if they were\ncrimes, nor made use of many precautions that I might remain unknown;\nand this partly because I should have thought such a course of conduct\na wrong against myself, and partly because it would have occasioned me\nsome sort of uneasiness which would again have been contrary to the\nperfect mental tranquillity which I court. And forasmuch as, while thus\nindifferent to the thought alike of fame or of forgetfulness, I have\nyet been unable to prevent myself from acquiring some sort of\nreputation, I have thought it incumbent on me to do my best to save\nmyself at least from being ill-spoken of. The other reason that has\ndetermined me to commit to writing these specimens of philosophy is,\nthat I am becoming daily more and more alive to the delay which my\ndesign of self-instruction suffers, for want of the infinity of\nexperiments I require, and which it is impossible for me to make\nwithout the assistance of others: and, without flattering myself so\nmuch as to expect the public to take a large share in my interests, I\nam yet unwilling to be found so far wanting in the duty I owe to\nmyself, as to give occasion to those who shall survive me to make it\nmatter of reproach against me some day, that I might have left them\nmany things in a much more perfect state than I have done, had I not\ntoo much neglected to make them aware of the ways in which they could\nhave promoted the accomplishment of my designs.\nAnd I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which\nshould neither be obnoxious to much controversy, nor should compel me\nto expound more of my principles than I desired, and which should yet\nbe sufficient clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the\nsciences. Whether or not I have succeeded in this it is not for me to\nsay; and I do not wish to forestall the judgments of others by speaking\nmyself of my writings; but it will gratify me if they be examined, and,\nto afford the greater inducement to this I request all who may have any\nobjections to make to them, to take the trouble of forwarding these to\nmy publisher, who will give me notice of them, that I may endeavor to\nsubjoin at the same time my reply; and in this way readers seeing both\nat once will more easily determine where the truth lies; for I do not\nengage in any case to make prolix replies, but only with perfect\nfrankness to avow my errors if I am convinced of them, or if I cannot\nperceive them, simply to state what I think is required for defense of\nthe matters I have written, adding thereto no explication of any new\nmatte that it may not be necessary to pass without end from one thing\nto another.\nIf some of the matters of which I have spoken in the beginning of the\n\u201cDioptrics\u201d and \u201cMeteorics\u201d should offend at first sight, because I\ncall them hypotheses and seem indifferent about giving proof of them, I\nrequest a patient and attentive reading of the whole, from which I hope\nthose hesitating will derive satisfaction; for it appears to me that\nthe reasonings are so mutually connected in these treatises, that, as\nthe last are demonstrated by the first which are their causes, the\nfirst are in their turn demonstrated by the last which are their\neffects. Nor must it be imagined that I here commit the fallacy which\nthe logicians call a circle; for since experience renders the majority\nof these effects most certain, the causes from which I deduce them do\nnot serve so much to establish their reality as to explain their\nexistence; but on the contrary, the reality of the causes is\nestablished by the reality of the effects. Nor have I called them\nhypotheses with any other end in view except that it may be known that\nI think I am able to deduce them from those first truths which I have\nalready expounded; and yet that I have expressly determined not to do\nso, to prevent a certain class of minds from thence taking occasion to\nbuild some extravagant philosophy upon what they may take to be my\nprinciples, and my being blamed for it. I refer to those who imagine\nthat they can master in a day all that another has taken twenty years\nto think out, as soon as he has spoken two or three words to them on\nthe subject; or who are the more liable to error and the less capable\nof perceiving truth in very proportion as they are more subtle and\nlively. As to the opinions which are truly and wholly mine, I offer no\napology for them as new,--persuaded as I am that if their reasons be\nwell considered they will be found to be so simple and so conformed, to\ncommon sense as to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than\nany others which can be held on the same subjects; nor do I even boast\nof being the earliest discoverer of any of them, but only of having\nadopted them, neither because they had nor because they had not been\nheld by others, but solely because reason has convinced me of their\ntruth.\nThough artisans may not be able at once to execute the invention which\nis explained in the \u201cDioptrics,\u201d I do not think that any one on that\naccount is entitled to condemn it; for since address and practice are\nrequired in order so to make and adjust the machines described by me as\nnot to overlook the smallest particular, I should not be less\nastonished if they succeeded on the first attempt than if a person were\nin one day to become an accomplished performer on the guitar, by merely\nhaving excellent sheets of music set up before him. And if I write in\nFrench, which is the language of my country, in preference to Latin,\nwhich is that of my preceptors, it is because I expect that those who\nmake use of their unprejudiced natural reason will be better judges of\nmy opinions than those who give heed to the writings of the ancients\nonly; and as for those who unite good sense with habits of study, whom\nalone I desire for judges, they will not, I feel assured, be so partial\nto Latin as to refuse to listen to my reasonings merely because I\nexpound them in the vulgar tongue.\nIn conclusion, I am unwilling here to say anything very specific of the\nprogress which I expect to make for the future in the sciences, or to\nbind myself to the public by any promise which I am not certain of\nbeing able to fulfill; but this only will I say, that I have resolved\nto devote what time I may still have to live to no other occupation\nthan that of endeavoring to acquire some knowledge of Nature, which\nshall be of such a kind as to enable us therefrom to deduce rules in\nmedicine of greater certainty than those at present in use; and that my\ninclination is so much opposed to all other pursuits, especially to\nsuch as cannot be useful to some without being hurtful to others, that\nif, by any circumstances, I had been constrained to engage in such, I\ndo not believe that I should have been able to succeed. Of this I here\nmake a public declaration, though well aware that it cannot serve to\nprocure for me any consideration in the world, which, however, I do not\nin the least affect; and I shall always hold myself more obliged to\nthose through whose favor I am permitted to enjoy my retirement without\ninterruption than to any who might offer me the highest earthly\npreferments.", "source": "discourse_method.txt"}
