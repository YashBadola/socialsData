Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all.
So we must follow the common, yet though my Word is common, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own.
It is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.
Thought is common to all.
Those who speak with understanding must hold fast to what is common to all as a city holds fast to its law, and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law.
To the soul, belongs the self-multiplying Logos.
Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.
The wise is one only. It is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus.
