You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.
We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.
It scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.
It rests by changing.
We must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.
War is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.
Couples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.
Men do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.
The hidden attunement is better than the open.
The straight and the crooked path of the fuller's comb is one and the same.
The way up and the way down is one and the same.
Mortals are immortals and immortals are mortals, the one living the others' death and dying the others' life.
Cold things become warm, and what is warm cools; what is wet dries, and the parched is moistened.
Even the posset separates if it is not stirred.
Time is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is a child's.
