Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and altogether appropriate to assume that they have doubted, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they went further. Having accomplished this preliminary movement, they have perceived that they would not find what they sought in this way, wherefore they do well to go further.

Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.

The Knight of Infinite Resignation

The knight of infinite resignation is easily recognized: his walk is light and bold. But he who belongs to the infinite usually lacks the finite. He has made the movement of infinity, and he has made it with such correctness and assurance that he does not need to fear the finite, for the finite cannot reach him. He is a stranger in the world, and the world is a stranger to him.

The Knight of Faith

But the knight of faith is the only happy one, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. To get the princess, to live with her joyfully and happily day in and day out (for it is also conceivable that the knight of resignation might get the princess, but that his soul had sensed the sting of the infinite, so that the finite could not make him happy)—that is the feat.

Abraham

And God tempted Abraham and said unto him, Take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

It was early in the morning, Abraham rose early, he saddled his ass, he took his two young men with him, and Isaac his son; he clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
