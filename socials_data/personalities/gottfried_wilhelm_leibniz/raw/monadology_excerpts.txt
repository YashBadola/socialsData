1. The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple, that is to say, without parts.

2. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for a composite is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.

3. Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things.

4. No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be perished by natural means.

5. For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be begun by natural means. For that which cannot be formed by the composition of parts can not be begun by the formation of parts.

6. Thus it may be said that a Monad can only come into being or end all at once; that is to say, it can come into being only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is composite begins or ends by parts.

7. There is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place of anything in it or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of composites, in which there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can come into a Monad from outside.

8. Yet the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ from one another, there would be no way of perceiving any change in things; for what is in the composite can come only from the simple ingredients, and the Monads, if they were without qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, assuming a plenum, each place would always receive, in any motion, exactly the equivalent of what it already had, and one state of things would be indistinguishable from another.

9. Indeed, each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an internal quality [intrinsic denomination].

10. I assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.

11. It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.

12. But, besides the principle of the change, there must be a detailed that which changes, which constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature and variety of the simple substances.

13. This detail must involve a multitude in the unity or in the simple. For since every natural change takes place by degrees, something changes and something remains; and consequently there must be in the simple substance a plurality of affections and relations, although there are no parts.

14. The passing condition, which involves and represents a multitude in the unity or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in what follows. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies. Thus, like the crowd, they have failed to distinguish between a prolonged unconsciousness and absolute death, which has made them fall into the Scholastic error of believing of souls entirely separate from bodies and has even confirmed ill-balanced minds in the opinion that the soul is mortal.

15. The action of the internal principle which causes the change or the passage from one perception to another may be called Appetition; it is true that desire cannot always fully attain to the whole perception at which it aims, but it always obtains some of it and reaches new perceptions.
