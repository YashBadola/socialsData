One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.

If her functioning as a female is not enough to define woman, if we decline also to explain her through "the eternal feminine," and if nevertheless we admit, provisionally, that women do exist, then we must face the question: what is a woman?

To define her making use of the category of the Other is not to define her at all; it is to define her relationship with the man. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other.

The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality - that of the Self and the Other. This duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes; it was not dependent upon any empirical facts. It is revealed in such works as that of Granet on Chinese thought and in those of Dumezil on the Indies and Rome. In the pairs Varuna-Mitra, Uranus-Zeus, Sun-Moon, and Day-Night, no female element is involved at first; neither in the pair Good-Evil, of which the Manichaeans set up a dualism.

But if the Other is not to suggest a hostile or threatening presence, if the relationship is to be lived as a free exchange between two consciousnesses, each must recognize the other as a subject. But the woman is not an autonomous subject; she is relative.
