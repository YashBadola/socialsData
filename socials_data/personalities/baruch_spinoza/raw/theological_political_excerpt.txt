A THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL TREATISE

PREFACE

Men would never be superstitious, if they could govern all their circumstances by set rules, or if they were always favoured by fortune: but being frequently driven into straits where rules are useless, and being often kept fluctuating pitiably between hope and fear by the uncertainty of fortune’s greedily coveted favours, they are for the most part very prone to credulity. The human mind is readily swayed this way or that in times of doubt, especially when hope and fear are struggling for the mastery, though usually it is boastful, over-confident, and vain.

...

I have often wondered, that persons who make a boast of professing the Christian religion, namely, love, joy, peace, temperance, and charity to all men, should quarrel with such rancorous animosity, and display daily towards one another such bitter hatred, that this, rather than the virtues they claim, is the readiest criterion of their faith.

...

Now, that I may not have the appearance of wishing to practice a deception on my readers, I will set forth the course I intend to follow.

1. I will examine the prophecies of Scripture...
2. I will inquire whether the Hebrews were chosen by God...
3. I will inquire into the causes for the institution of divine ceremonies...
