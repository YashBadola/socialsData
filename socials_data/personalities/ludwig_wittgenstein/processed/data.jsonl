{"text": "1. ...But what is the meaning of the word \"five\"? - No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n23. ...Here the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n65. Here we come up against the great question that lies behind all these considerations. - For someone might object against me: \"You take the easy way out! You talk about all sorts of language-games, but have nowhere said what the essence of a language-game, and hence of language, is: what is common to all these activities, and what makes them into language or parts of language. So you let yourself off the very part of the investigation that once gave you yourself most headache, the part about the general form of propositions and of language.\" And this is true. - Instead of producing something common to all that we call language, I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common which makes us use the same word for all, - but that they are related to one another in many different ways. And it is because of this relationship, or these relationships, that we call them all \"language\".\n66. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? - Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\" - but look and see whether there is anything common to all. - For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don't think, but look!\n67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way. - And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n109. ...Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n119. The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or another piece of plain nonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running its head against the limits of language. These bumps make us see the value of the discovery.\n199. Is what we call \"obeying a rule\" something that it would be possible for only one man to do, and to do only once in his life? - This is of course a note on the grammar of the expression \"to obey a rule\".\n202. And hence also 'obeying a rule' is a practice. And to think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule 'privately': otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying it.\n246. In what sense are my sensations private? - Well, only I can know whether I am really in pain; another person can only surmise it. - In one way this is wrong, and in another nonsense. If we are using the word \"to know\" as it is normally used (and how else are we to use it?), then other people very often know when I am in pain.\n257. ...When one says \"He gave a name to his sensation\" one forgets that a great deal of stage-setting in the language is presupposed if the mere act of naming is to make sense.\n293. If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word \"pain\" means - must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?\n...Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \"beetle\". No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. - Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. - But suppose the word \"beetle\" had a use in these people's language? - If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty. - No, one can 'divide through' by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.\n309. What is your aim in philosophy? - To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.", "source": "investigations.txt"}
