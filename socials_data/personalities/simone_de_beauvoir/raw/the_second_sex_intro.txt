One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other.

The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality - that of the Self and the Other. This duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes; it was not dependent upon any empirical facts.

Thus humanity is male and man defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other.

The situation of woman is that she – a free and autonomous being like all human creatures – nevertheless finds herself living in a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other. They propose to stabilize her as object and to doom her to immanence since her transcendence is to be overshadowed and forever transcended by another ego (conscience) which is essential and sovereign.

If the woman question seems trivial, it is because masculine arrogance has made of it a "quarrel"; and when quarreling one no longer reasons well.

To be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future.
