1. The world is everything that is the case.
1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
1.2 The world divides into facts.

6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)
7. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
