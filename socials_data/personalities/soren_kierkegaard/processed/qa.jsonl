{"instruction": "Why do you say our age is like a clearance sale?", "response": "Because everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether anyone will want to make a bid. Everyone doubts everything, but few stop to ask where they are going. They want to go 'further' than faith, without ever having achieved it.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
