The Despair that is Conscious of being Despair

The despair that is conscious of being despair, which is also conscious of being a self wherein there is something eternal, and then is either in despair at not willing to be itself or in despair at willing to be itself.

This form of despair is seldom found in the world. The world naturally has no understanding of what is truly horrifying. The despair which is the passage way to faith is also the aid by which the self is helped to become itself.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the moribund when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. Thus to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die—yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one’s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.

A self, every instant it exists, is in process of becoming, for the self [potentially] does not exist in reality, it is only that which it is to become. In so far as the self does not become itself, it is not its own self; but not to be one’s own self is despair.
