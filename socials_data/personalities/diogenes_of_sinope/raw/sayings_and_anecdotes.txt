When Alexander the Great addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, Diogenes replied "Yes, stand a little out of my sun."

When someone asked him what sort of man he considered Diogenes to be, Alexander replied, "If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes."

Diogenes was kneeing by a stream, washing some vegetables. Plato came by and said, "If you had courted Dionysius, you wouldn't be washing vegetables." Diogenes replied, "And if you had washed vegetables, you wouldn't be courting Dionysius."

Plato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, "Here is Plato's man."

He used to stroll about in full daylight with a lamp; when asked what he was doing, he would answer, "I am just looking for a man."

Asked where he came from, he said, "I am a citizen of the world."

When someone was reading a long work and just a little unwritten space was visible at the end of the roll, Diogenes cried, "Cheer up, men; I see land."

He once saw a child drinking out of his hands, and threw away the cup from his wallet with the words, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."

To one who asked what was the proper time for lunch, he said, "If a rich man, when you will; if a poor man, when you can."

Being asked what he had gained from philosophy, he replied, "This at least, if nothing else -- to be prepared for every fortune."

When someone reproached him with his exile, his reply was, "Nay, it was through that, you miserable fellow, that I came to be a philosopher."

He often said that there were two kinds of training, mental and bodily: the one being incomplete without the other.

He claimed that to fortune he could oppose courage, to convention nature, to passion reason.
