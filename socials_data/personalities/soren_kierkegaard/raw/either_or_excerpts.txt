Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.

There are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life's highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death.

The Rotation of Crops

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed method of all experimentation. Rollicking, high-spirited people who haven't yet taken the exam of life, but like a juggler are just beginning to show their tricks, usually proceed from the principle that everything is vanity. But the result is always negative, for the simple reason that one can only become aware of the vanity of everything when one has understood that everything is vanity.

My method does not proceed from such a high principle. I start with the principle that all men are bores. Surely no one will prove himself so great a bore as to contradict me in this.

The Seducer's Diary

Cordelia! Is it not true, yours is a name that sounds like the beating of a heart? Cordelia! Cordelia!

I can no longer endure this life. The emptiness is appalling. I have only one friend, and that is Echo; and why is Echo my friend? Because I love my own sorrow, and Echo does not take it from me. I have only one confidant, and that is the silence of the night; and why is it my confidant? Because it remains silent.
