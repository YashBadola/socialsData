DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, walking is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.

This is what is sad: "in a theater, it happened that a fire started offstage. The clown came out to tell the audience. They thought it was a joke and applauded. He told them again, and they became still more hilarious. This is the way, I suppose, that the world will be destroyed—amid the universal hilarity of wits and wags who think it is all a joke."

THE ROTATION METHOD

Boredom is the root of all evil—the despairing refusal to be oneself.

The method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but, like proper crop rotation, consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kinds of crops. Here at once we have the principle of limitation, the only saving principle in the world. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive, and a spider may furnish him with much entertainment.

One must guard against friendship. How is a friend defined? A friend is a "me" which is not me, a "me" of the adoption. But one must never become "we".

One must never enter into the relation of marriage. Husband and wife promise to love one another for eternity. This is easy enough, but it does not mean very much; for if one finishes with time one is done with the temporal. If, on the other hand, it means that they are to love one another for a long period of time, then I cannot see how they can promise that, since this is not in their power.
