One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of others can establish an individual as an Other.

The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality—that of the Self and the Other. This duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes; it was not dependent upon any empirical facts. It is revealed in the eyes of the master confronting the slave, or in the colonist confronting the native. But in the relation between man and woman, this Otherness is absolute.

Man defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential.

Why do women not dispute this sovereignty? Why do they not lay claim to the status of subject? The answer lies in the specific nature of their situation. The bond that unites her to her oppressors is not comparable to any other. The division of the sexes is a biological fact, not an event in human history. Male and female stand opposed within a primordial Mitsein, and woman has not broken it. The couple is a fundamental unity with its two halves riveted together, and the cleavage of society along the line of sex is impossible. Woman cannot say "we" in the way the proletariat says "we" or the Negro says "we". They do not authentically posit themselves as Subject.
