{"text": "FANATICISM\nFanaticism is to superstition what delirium is to fever, what rage is to anger. He who has ecstasies and visions, who takes dreams for realities, and his own imaginations for prophecies, is an enthusiast; he who supports his madness with murder is a fanatic. John Diaz, who was an assassin at Nuremberg, was convinced that the Pope was the Antichrist of the Revelation, and that he had the mark of the beast. He was quite sure that he should please God by killing his brother, who was a Protestant, and he killed him.\nThe most detestable example of fanaticism is that of the bourgeois of Paris who ran to assassinate, butcher, throw out of the window, and tear to pieces, their fellow citizens who did not go to mass.\nThere are cold-blooded fanatics; such as the judges who condemn to death those who have no other crime than that of thinking differently from themselves; and these are so much the more guilty, and the more worthy of the execration of mankind, as they are not under the influence of that fury which the others are.", "source": "philosophical_dictionary_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "LETTER X. ON TRADE\nAs trade enriched the citizens in England, so it contributed to their freedom, and this freedom on the other side extended their commerce, whence arose the grandeur of the State. Trade raised by insensible degrees the naval power, which gives the English a superiority over the seas, and they now are masters of very near two hundred ships of war. Posterity will very probably be surprised to hear that an island whose only produce is a little lead, tin, fuller's earth, and coarse wool, should become so powerful by its commerce, as to be able to send, in 1723, three fleets at the same time to three different and far distanced parts of the globe. One before Gibraltar, conquered and kept by its arms; another to Porto Bello, to dispossess the King of Spain of the treasures of the West Indies; and a third into the Baltic, to prevent the Northern Powers from coming to an engagement.\nAt the time when Louis XIV made all Italy tremble, and that his armies, which were already masters of Savoy and Piedmont, were on the point of taking Turin; Prince Eugene was obliged to march from the middle of Germany in order to succour the Duke of Savoy. Having no money, without which cities can neither be taken nor defended, he addressed himself to some English merchants, who, at an hour and half's warning, lent him five millions, whereby he was enabled to deliver Turin, and to beat the French; after which he wrote the following short letter to the persons who had disbursed him the above-mentioned sums: \"Gentlemen, I have received your money, and flatter myself that I have laid it out to your satisfaction.\" Such a circumstance as this raises a just pride in an English merchant, and makes him presume (not without some reason) to compare himself to a Roman citizen; and indeed a peer's brother does not think traffic beneath him.", "source": "letters_on_england_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "CHAPTER I\nHOW CANDIDE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE AND HOW HE WAS DRIVEN THENCE\nIn the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh in Westphalia there lived a youth, endowed by Nature with the most gentle character. His face was the expression of his soul. His judgment was quite honest and he was extremely simple-minded; and this was the reason, I think, that he was named Candide. Old servants in the house suspected that he was the son of the Baron's sister and a decent honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom this young lady would never marry because he could only prove seventy-one quarterings, and the rest of his genealogical tree had been lost, owing to the injuries of time.\nThe Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had a door and windows. His Great Hall was even decorated with a piece of tapestry. The dogs in his stable-yards formed a pack of hounds when necessary; his grooms were his huntsmen; the village curate was his Grand Almoner. They all called him \"My Lord,\" and laughed heartily at his stories.\nThe Baroness weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, was therefore greatly respected, and did the honors of the house with a dignity which rendered her still more respectable. Her daughter Cunegonde, aged seventeen, was rosy-cheeked, fresh, plump and tempting. The Baron's son appeared in every respect worthy of his father. The tutor Pangloss was the oracle of the house, and little Candide listened to his lessons with all the good faith of his age and character.\nPangloss taught metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology. He proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause and that in this best of all possible worlds, My Lord the Baron's castle was the best of all possible castles and My Lady the best of all possible Baronesses.\n\"'Tis demonstrated,\" said he, \"that things cannot be otherwise; for, since everything is made for an end, everything is necessarily for the best end. Observe that noses were made to wear spectacles; and so we have spectacles. Legs were visibly instituted to be breeched, and we have breeches. Stones were formed to be quarried and to build castles; and My Lord has a very noble castle; the greatest Baron in the province should have the best house; and as pigs were made to be eaten, we eat pork all the year round; consequently, those who have asserted that all is well have said a foolish thing; they should have said that all is for the best.\"", "source": "candide_excerpt.txt"}
