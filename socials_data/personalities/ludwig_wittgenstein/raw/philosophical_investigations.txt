The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have known since long.
Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.
A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.
If a lion could speak, we could not understand him.
The meaning of a word is its use in the language.
To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life.
Language-games are the forms of language with which a child begins to make use of words.
The human body is the best picture of the human soul.
Don't think, but look!
Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and neither explains nor deduces anything.—Since everything lies open to view there is nothing to explain. For what is hidden, for example, is of no interest to us.
One might also give the name "philosophy" to what is possible before all new discoveries and inventions.
The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or another piece of plain nonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running its head against the limits of language.
What is your aim in philosophy?—To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.
