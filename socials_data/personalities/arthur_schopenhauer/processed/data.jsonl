it must only not be lost.\nA man\u2019s face as a rule says more, and more interesting things, than his mouth, for it is a compendium of everything his mouth will ever say, in that it is the monogram of all his thoughts and aspirations.\nWicked thoughts and worthless efforts gradually set their mark on the face, especially the eyes.\nFrom the point of view of youth, life is an endless future;

pleasure is the negative element, being the cessation of pain.\nEvery human life is tossed backward and forward between pain and boredom.\nThe vanity of existence is revealed in the whole form existence assumes: in the infinitude of time and space contrasted with the finite nature of the individual;
