{"text": "Judging by what you write me, and by what I hear, I am forming a good opinion regarding your future. You do not run hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for such restlessness is the sign of a disordered spirit. The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company. Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and this visiting of a miscellany of books should have something aimless and unstable about it. You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win a firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner.\nFood does no good and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten. Nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction. Accordingly, since you cannot read all the books which you may possess, it is enough to possess only as many books as you can read. \"But,\" you reply, \"I wish to dip first into one book and then into another.\" I tell you that it is the sign of an over-nice appetite to toy with many dishes; for when they are manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish. So you should always read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall back upon those whom you read before. Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day.\nThis is my own custom; from the many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself. The thought for today is one which I discovered in Epicurus; for I am wont to cross over even into the enemy's camp,\u2014not as a deserter, but as a scout. He says: \"Contented poverty is an honourable estate.\" Indeed, if it be contented, it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. What does it matter how much a man has laid up in his safe, or in his warehouse, how large are his flocks and how fat his dividends, if he covets his neighbour's property, and reckons, not his past gains, but his hopes of gains to come? Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough. Farewell.", "source": "letter_2.txt"}
{"text": "We shall now inquire whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and should, in part, be kept. ... Anger is a temporary madness. For it is devoid of self-control, forgetful of decency, unmindful of ties, persistent and diligent in whatever it begins, closed to reason and counsel, excited by trifling causes, unfit to discern the right and true... To be angry is to be moved by a passion which is as far removed from reason as it is from sanity.\nAnger is not useful even in war or battle; for it is prone to rashness, and rashness is the height of folly. What is more, it is not vice that makes a man brave, but virtue; and if virtue is not enough, then vice will not help either. But if anger were useful, it would be useful to the wise man; but the wise man is not subject to anger.\nThere is no reason, therefore, why you should think that anger contributes anything to the greatness of the soul. It is not greatness, it is a swelling; just as a disease distends the body and makes it swollen, so anger puffs up the soul.", "source": "on_anger.txt"}
{"text": "Greetings from your friend Seneca. Continue as you have begun, and make haste to set yourself free. Gather and save your time, which has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words,\u2014that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed, you will see that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.\nWhat man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands. Therefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by.\nNothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity,\u2014time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.\nYou may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising. I confess that, being a not unthrifty spender, I keep an account of my outlays. I cannot say that I lose nothing, but I can say what I lose, and why, and how. I can give you the reasons for my poverty. But it happens to me as it happens to many others who are reduced to slender means through no fault of their own: everyone forgives them, but no one comes to their rescue.\nWhat is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.

{"text": "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends for a long period if you know how to manage it.\nWhy do we complain of Nature? She has shown herself kindly; life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one man is possessed by an avarice that is insatiable, another by a toilsome devotion to tasks that are useless; one man is besotted with wine, another is paralyzed by sloth; one man is exhausted by an ambition that always hangs upon the decision of others, another, driven on by the greed of a trader, is led to travel over all lands and all seas by the hope of gain; some are tormented by a passion for war and are always either bent upon inflicting danger on others or concerned about their own; some there are who are worn out by voluntary servitude in a thankless attendance upon great men; many are kept busy either in the pursuit of other men's fortune or in complaining of their own; many, following no fixed aim, shifting and inconstant and dissatisfied, are plunged by their fickleness into plans that are ever new; some have no fixed principle by which to direct their course, but Fate takes them unawares while they are lolling and yawning\u2014so surely does it happen that I cannot doubt the truth of that which the greatest of poets said with all the seeming of an oracle: \"The part of life we really live is small.\" For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.", "source": "on_shortness_of_life.txt"}
