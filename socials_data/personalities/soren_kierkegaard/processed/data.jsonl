{"text": "DIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.\n...\nI don't care for anything. I don't care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I don't care to walk, it's too strenuous. I don't care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I don't care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't care to do that either. Summa Summarum: I don't care.\n...\nThe Rotation Method.\nPeople are generally of the opinion that the world is becoming more and more practical, that the time is past when one can live on air. I am of a contrary opinion; I think the world is becoming more and more abstract, and that the time is coming when one will be able to live on the idea.\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually abbreviated to this, that it is the root of all evil.\n...\nTHE AESTHETIC VALIDITY OF MARRIAGE\nYou are an aesthete, and yet you wish to marry. This is a contradiction. To marry is the most ethical of all acts. It is the expression of the universal. The aesthete lives in the immediate, in the moment. Marriage is a resignation of the moment for the sake of the eternal.\nMy friend, you are young, your mind is full of plans, and you want to conquer the world. But conquer yourself first. Choose yourself. By choosing yourself you put yourself in possession of yourself, and this possession is the only true wealth.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "PREFACE\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be asked how much further they go?\n...\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\n...\nThe Knight of Faith.\nIf I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say: He resigns everything infinitely, and then he grasps everything again by virtue of the absurd. He makes the movements of infinity, but he does it with such correctness and assurance that he constantly gets the finite back out of it.\nHe is not a poet, and I have vainly sought to detect the poetic in him. He is no genius, but frankly, he is something far higher. He is the Knight of Faith. He lives in the finite as if he had not a care in the world, yet he has resigned the whole world. He takes delight in everything he sees, in the human swarm, in the new omnibuses, in the water of the sound. He is interested in everything.\n...\nThe Teleological Suspension of the Ethical.\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it, it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal.\nBut if the ethical (i.e. the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing can incommensurably be left over in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e. the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But here is the paradox of faith: that the single individual is higher than the universal.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
