{"text": "You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\nWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\nIt scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.\nMen do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.\nIt rests by changing.\nCouples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.", "source": "flux.txt"}
{"text": "This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nThe transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind.\nIt is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\nAll things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.\nFire in its advance will judge and convict all things.\nFire lives the death of air, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of earth, earth that of water.\nThe wise is one only. It is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus.\nThe sun is new every day.\nThe sun will not overstep his measures; if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of Justice, will find him out.", "source": "fire_and_cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Word, men seem as if they had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its kind and showing how it truly is. But other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they do in sleep.\nSo we must follow the common, yet though my Word is common, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own.\nIt is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.\nThought is common to all.\nThose who speak with understanding must hold fast to what is common to all as a city holds fast to its law, and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law. It prevails as much as it will, and suffices for all things with something to spare.\nWisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.", "source": "logos.txt"}
{"text": "For even the best of them choose one thing above all others, immortal glory among mortals, while most of them are glutted like beasts.\nFor what thought or wisdom have they? They follow the poets and take the crowd as their teacher, knowing not that there are many bad and few good.\nThe Ephesians would do well to hang themselves, every grown man of them, and leave the city to beardless lads; for they have cast out Hermodoros, the best man among them, saying, \"We will have none who is best among us; if there be any such, let him be so elsewhere and among others.\"\nFools when they do hear are like the deaf: of them does the saying bear witness that they are absent when present.\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have souls that understand not their language.\nAsses would rather have straw than gold.\nThe fool is fluttered at every word.\nDogs bark at every one they do not know.\nIn Priene lived Bias, son of Teutamas, who is of more account than the rest. (He said, \"Most men are bad.\")\nHomer should be turned out of the lists and whipped, and Archilochos likewise.\nHesiod is most men's teacher.
