{"text": "1. The most widely accepted and significant notion of the world which we can form is that of a large family of which God is the father, or a state of which God is the monarch. But we must advance further and know that this family or this state is a collection of minds or of souls, and that the happiness of these minds is the principal design of God.\n2. God is an absolutely perfect being; this is what is most generally known, but the consequences which follow from it are not sufficiently considered. From this we can easily judge that he does everything in the most desirable way, since he possesses the supreme wisdom and the supreme goodness.\n3. The actions of God are always the most perfect, not only in themselves, but also in relation to his creatures. He has chosen the best of all possible worlds, and he has done so because his wisdom showed him which was the best, his goodness made him choose it, and his power made him produce it.\n4. It is true that we do not always perceive the perfection of God's works, because we look at them only in part; but if we could see the whole, we should find that there is nothing which could be better. The imperfections which we see are like the dissonance in a piece of music which makes the harmony more beautiful, or like the shadows in a painting which bring out the colors.\n5. Since God is the most perfect of all beings, and since he is the cause of all other beings, it follows that the perfections of the other beings are emanations of his perfections, and that their imperfections come from their own nature, which is incapable of having no limits. For God alone is without limits.\n6. Everything that happens is a consequence of the nature of things, or of the laws which God has established. And since God has established these laws with the greatest wisdom, everything that happens must be for the best.\n7. Thus, we should be content with the order of the past, because it is the will of God, and we should try to make the future as good as possible, because that is also the will of God. For God wants us to act according to reason and virtue.\n8. It is sufficient to have this confidence in God, that he does everything for the best, and that nothing can harm those who love him. But to know in detail the reasons for his providence is beyond our capacity, and we should not try to penetrate into his secrets.\n9. Nevertheless, we can know some general principles of his administration, such as the principle of sufficient reason, which states that nothing happens without a reason why it should be so rather than otherwise; and the principle of the identity of indiscernibles, which states that there are no two things in nature which are exactly alike.\n10. These principles are the foundation of all our reasoning, and they enable us to understand the nature of things and the laws of the universe. By applying them, we can discover the true causes of phenomena and the wisdom of the Creator.", "source": "discourse_on_metaphysics_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "1. The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple, that is to say, without parts.\n2. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for a composite is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.\n3. Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things.\n4. No dissolution of these elements is to be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.\n5. For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into existence by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the composition of parts.\n6. Thus it may be said that a Monad can only come into existence or end at once; that is to say, it can come into existence only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is compound comes into existence or ends by parts.\n7. There is also no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place of anything in it or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in that which is compound, where there are parts which have some change. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.\n8. Yet the Monad must have some qualities, otherwise it would be not even a being. And if simple substances did not differ for us in their qualities, there would be no means of perceiving any change in things; for what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each place would always receive, in any motion, exactly the equivalent of what it already had, and no one state of things would be discernible from another.\n9. Indeed, each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality.\n10. I assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.\n11. It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.\n12. But, besides the principle of the change, there must be a diverse that changes, so that may produce the specific variety of the simple substances.\n13. This particular must be contained in the simple substance; and there must be a variety of affections to correspond to the variety of the thing.\n14. The passing condition, which involves and represents a multitude in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in the following. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies.\n15. The action of the internal principle which brings about the change or the passage from one perception to another, may be called Appetition; it is true that desire cannot always fully attain to the whole perception at which it aims, but it always obtains some of it and reaches new perceptions.", "source": "monadology_excerpts.txt"}
