We must not be angry with the gods, for these are the source of our benefits, not of our misfortunes; nor with men, for they are our fellow-creatures. In fact, if we are angry with the good, we are wrong; if with the bad, we are wasting our time. For who is angry with a child because it is not yet able to walk? Who is angry with a sick man because he has a fever? It is the part of a madman to be angry with things which have no life, and which can neither hurt nor help us.

Anger is a temporary madness. For look at the tokens of those who are possessed by anger: their eyes blaze and sparkle, their whole face is crimson with the blood that surges up from the depths of the heart, their lips quiver, their teeth grind, their hair bristles and stands on end, their breathing is forced and rapid, their joints crack from writhing, they groan and bellow, and burst out into speech with scarcely intelligible words, they strike their hands together and stamp the ground with their feet, and their whole body is agitated and performs the threat of anger. It is an ugly and horrible picture of distorted and swollen frenzy—you cannot tell whether this vice is more execrable or more hideous.

The best plan is to reject straightway the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason goes for nothing when once the passions have been admitted to the mind, and have by our own free will been given a certain authority; they will for the future do as much as they choose, not only as much as you will allow them. The enemy must be met at the very frontier: when he has once entered the city and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set bounds to his victory.
