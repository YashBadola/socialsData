{"text": "THEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL TREATISE\nCHAPTER XX. THAT IN A FREE STATE EVERY MAN MAY THINK WHAT HE LIKES, AND SAY WHAT HE THINKS.\nIf men's minds were as easily controlled as their tongues, every king would sit safely on his throne, and government by compulsion would cease; for every subject would shape his life according to the intentions of his rulers, and would esteem a thing true or false, good or evil, just or unjust, in obedience to their dictates. However, we have shown already (Chapter XVII.) that no man's mind can possibly lie wholly at the disposition of another, for no one can willingly transfer his natural right of free reason and judgment, or be compelled so to do. For this reason government which attempts to control minds is accounted tyrannical, and it is considered an abuse of sovereignty and a usurpation of the rights of subjects, to seek to prescribe what shall be accepted as true, or rejected as false, or what opinions should actuate men in their worship of God. All these questions fall within a man's natural right, which he cannot abdicate even with his own consent.\nI admit that the judgment can be biassed in many ways, and to an almost incredible degree, so that while exempt from direct external control it may be so dependent on another man's words, that it may fitly be said to be ruled by him; but although this influence is carried to great lengths, it has never gone so far as to invalidate the statement, that every man's understanding is his own, and that brains are as diverse as palates.", "source": "ttp_freedom.txt"}
{"text": "ETHICS\nPART II. ON THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND.\nPREFACE.\nI now pass on to explaining those things which must necessarily follow from the essence of God, or of the eternal and infinite being; not, indeed, all of them (for we proved in Part I., Prop. xvi., that an infinite number of things flow from the same necessity of existence in an infinite number of ways), but only those that are able to lead us, as it were by the hand, to the knowledge of the human mind and its highest blessedness.\nDEFINITIONS.\nI. By body I mean a mode which expresses in a certain determinate manner the essence of God, in so far as he is considered as an extended thing. (See Pt. i., Prop. xxv. Coroll.)\nII. I consider as belonging to the essence of a thing that, which being given, the thing is necessarily given also, and, which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also; in other words, that without which the thing, and which itself without the thing, can neither be nor be conceived.\nIII. By idea, I mean the mental conception which is formed by the mind as a thinking thing.\nExplanation.\u2014I say conception rather than perception, because the word perception seems to imply that the mind is passive in respect to the object; whereas conception seems to express an action of the mind.\nIV. By an adequate idea, I mean an idea which, in so far as it is considered in itself, without relation to the object, has all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea.\nExplanation.\u2014I say intrinsic, in order to exclude that mark which is extrinsic, namely, the agreement between the idea and its object (ideatum).\nV. Duration is the indefinite continuance of existence.\nExplanation.\u2014I say indefinite, because it cannot be determined through the existence itself of the existing thing, or by its efficient cause, which necessarily gives the existence of the thing, but does not take it away.\nVI. Reality and perfection I use as synonymous terms.\nVII. By particular things, I mean things which are finite and have a conditioned existence; but if several individual things concur in one action, so as to be all together the simultaneous cause of one effect, I consider them all so far as one particular thing.", "source": "ethics_part2_mind.txt"}
{"text": "ETHICS\nPART I. CONCERNING GOD.\nDEFINITIONS.\nI. By that which is self-caused, I mean that of which the essence involves existence, or that of which the nature is only conceivable as existent.\nII. A thing is called finite after its kind, when it can be limited by another thing of the same nature; for instance, a body is called finite because we always conceive another greater body. So, also, a thought is limited by another thought, but a body is not limited by thought, nor a thought by body.\nIII. By substance, I mean that which is in itself, and is conceived through itself: in other words, that of which a conception can be formed independently of any other conception.\nIV. By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance.\nV. By mode, I mean the modifications of substance, or that which exists in, and is conceived through, something other than itself.\nVI. By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite\u2014that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.\nExplanation.\u2014I say absolutely infinite, not infinite after its kind: for, of a thing infinite only after its kind, infinite attributes may be denied; but that which is absolutely infinite, contains in its essence whatever expresses reality, and involves no negation.\nVII. That thing is called free, which exists solely by the necessity of its own nature, and of which the action is determined by itself alone. On the other hand, that thing is necessary, or rather constrained, which is determined by something external to itself to a fixed and definite method of existence or action.\nVIII. By eternity, I mean existence itself, in so far as it is conceived necessarily to follow solely from the definition of that which is eternal.\nExplanation.\u2014For such existence is conceived as an eternal truth, like the essence of the thing, and therefore cannot be explained by duration or time, even if the duration be conceived without beginning or end.", "source": "ethics_part1_definitions.txt"}
