The despair that is conscious of being despair, as also of being a self, and such a self as it is, is the despair of not willing to be oneself; or the despair of willing to be oneself.

This is the formula for all despair, so that the expression for it is not just equivalence, but equality: to despair over oneself, in despair to will to be oneself, is the formula for all despair.

The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.

The greatest hazard of all, losing one’s self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.
