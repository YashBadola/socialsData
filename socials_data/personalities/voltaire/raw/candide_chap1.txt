Chapter I
How Candide was brought up in a magnificent castle and how he was driven out of it

In the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh in Westphalia, there lived a youth, endowed by nature with the most gentle manners. His soul was portrayed in his countenance. He united a sound judgment with a simplicity of spirit, which was the reason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old servants of the house suspected him to have been the son of the Baron’s sister and of a worthy gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that lady would never marry because he could prove no more than seventy-one quarterings, the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through the ravages of time.

The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had not only a gate, but windows. His great hall, even, was hung with tapestry. All the dogs of his farmyards formed a pack of hounds at need; his grooms were his huntsmen; and the curate of the village was his grand almoner. They called him “My Lord,” and laughed at all his stories.

The Baroness weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, was therefore a person of great consideration, and did the honors of the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. Her daughter Cunegonde, aged seventeen, was ruddy-cheeked, fresh, plump, and desirable. The Baron’s son appeared in every respect worthy of his father. The tutor Pangloss was the oracle of the house, and little Candide listened to his lessons with all the good faith of his age and character.

Pangloss taught metaphysico-theologico-cosmolonigology. He proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that in this best of all possible worlds, the Baron’s castle was the most magnificent of castles, and his lady the best of all possible Baronesses.

“It is demonstrable,” said he, “that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the best end. Observe, that the nose has been formed to bear spectacles—thus we have spectacles. Legs are visibly designed for stockings—and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and to construct castles—therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were made to be eaten—therefore we eat pork all the year round. Consequently they who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should have said all is for the best.”
