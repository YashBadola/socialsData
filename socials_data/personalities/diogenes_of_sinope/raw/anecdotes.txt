# Anecdotes and Sayings of Diogenes of Sinope

## The Lantern

Diogenes was known for carrying a lit lamp in broad daylight. When asked why he was doing this, he would reply, "I am looking for a man." By this, he implied that he could find no one who truly lived according to virtue and nature; he saw only people obsessed with wealth, status, and convention.

## Meeting Alexander the Great

When Alexander the Great came to Corinth, he sought out Diogenes, who was resting in the sunlight. Alexander, standing over him, asked if there was anything he could do for him. Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight." Alexander was so impressed by this indifference to his power that he later said, "If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes."

## Plato's Man

Plato defined man as "a featherless biped." The definition was praised until Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, declaring, "Behold! I've brought you a man." Plato was forced to add "with broad flat nails" to his definition.

## Casting Away the Cup

Diogenes possessed very few things. One day, he saw a child drinking water from his hands at a fountain. Diogenes immediately took the wooden cup he carried in his bag and threw it away, saying, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."

## On Exile

When someone reminded him that the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile, he replied, "And I sentenced them to stay at home."

## On Begging

When asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, he said, "Because they think they may one day be lame or blind, but never expect that they will turn to philosophy."

## The Rolling Tub

When the Corinthians were busy preparing for war against Philip of Macedon, Diogenes began rolling his tub (in which he lived) up and down the hill with great energy. When asked why he was doing this, he replied, "I do not wish to be thought the only idler among so many workers; so I am rolling my tub."

## Behavior

Diogenes believed that virtue was better revealed in action than in theory. He criticized the conventions of society as artificial and corrupt. He lived in a large ceramic jar (pithos) in the Metroon. He ate in the marketplace, which was against custom. He would even perform bodily functions in public to show his disdain for social norms.

When asked what was the most beautiful thing in the world, he replied, "Freedom of speech."
