{"text": "The wish for being is reserved for man alone; it is a wish that he cannot fulfill, but which he cannot cease to entertain. But this failure is not a defeat; it is the condition of his existence. Man exists only insofar as he is not; he is a disclosure of being, and he can disclose being only by being a lack of being. It is this lack which makes freedom possible.\nIf the satisfaction of the old man is not to be a mere stagnation, it must imply the movement of an indefinite transcendence; but if he has no future before him, if he is cut off from the world, this transcendence falls into a void. It is only in the presence of others that one can truly exist.\nThe man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.\nTo will oneself free is also to will others free. This is not an abstract formula. It points out to each individual that his freedom is not a solitary privilege but is linked to the freedom of all men. We can not be truly free unless we are surrounded by free men.\nThe ambiguity of the human condition is that man is at once a physical object, a thing among things, and a consciousness, a freedom. He is a sovereign subject and an object for others. He is an individual, and part of a collectivity. He is alive, and he will die. Ethics does not consist in denying this ambiguity, but in assuming it. To assume it is to refuse to flee into the illusion of an absolute, whether it be the absolute of God, of Nature, or of History. It is to accept the risk of existence, the risk of failure, the risk of freedom.\nThere is no justification for existence other than its own expansion. Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity.txt"}
{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, one sees young ladies in long dresses and ostrich-feather hats, and gentlemen wearing straw boaters, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and I am the baby. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Mama holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a plaid skirt and a beret, and I am two and a half years old. I was jealous of my sister.\nI was a dutiful daughter. I accepted the values of my environment: God, country, family. I went to a Catholic school, the Cours D\u00e9sir. I was a good student. I loved to learn. But very early on, I felt a certain detachment. I observed the adults around me, their contradictions, their hypocrisies.\nWhen I was about fifteen, I lost my faith. It was not a sudden crisis, but a slow erosion. I realized that God was an hypothesis I no longer needed. The world was enough for me. But this loss of faith left a void. If God did not exist, everything was permitted, said Ivan Karamazov. But if everything is permitted, is anything important? I had to find my own values, create my own meaning.\nI decided that I would be a writer. I wanted to tell the truth about my life, about the lives of women. I wanted to leave a mark on the world. I met Sartre at the Sorbonne. He was ugly, brilliant, and small. He was the first person who fully understood me, who challenged me intellectually. We made a pact: our love would be essential, but we would also have contingent loves. We would tell each other everything.\nMy youth was ending. I was becoming an adult. I was discovering the weight of the world, the reality of history. I was learning that freedom is a heavy burden, but the only one worth carrying.", "source": "memoirs.txt"}
{"text": "INTRODUCTION\nFor a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially to women; and it is not new. Enough ink has been spilled in the quarreling over feminism, now practically over, and perhaps we should say no more about it. It is still talked about, however, for the voluminous nonsense uttered during the last century seems to have done little to illuminate the problem. After all, is there a problem? And if so, what is it? Are there women, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: \"Even in Russia women still are women\"; and other well-informed persons\u2014sometimes the very same\u2014say with a sigh: \"Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.\" One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should, what place they occupy in this world, what their place should be. \"What is a woman?\"\nTo state the question is, to me, to suggest, at once, a preliminary answer. The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the idea of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: \"I am a woman\"; on this truth is based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes without saying that he is a man. The terms masculine and feminine are used symmetrically only as a matter of form, as on legal papers. In actuality the relation of the two sexes is not quite like that of two electrical poles, for man represents both the positive and the neutral, as is indicated by the common use of man to designate human beings in general; whereas woman represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity.\nOne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would not grasp the significance of being a specific sex if it were not taught it.\nThe situation of woman is that she\u2014a free and autonomous being like all human creatures\u2014nevertheless finds herself living in a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other. They propose to stabilize her as object and to doom her to immanence since her transcendence is to be overshadowed and forever transcended by another ego (conscience) which is essential and sovereign. The drama of woman lies in this conflict between the fundamental aspirations of every subject (who always regards the self as the essential) and the compulsions of a situation in which she is the inessential. How can a human being in the situation of a woman attain fulfillment? What roads are open to her? Which are blocked? How can independence be recovered in a state of dependency? What circumstances limit woman's liberty and how can they be overcome? These are the fundamental questions we would like to elucidate.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
