{"text": "THE ART OF CONTROVERSY.\n\nPRELIMINARY: LOGIC AND DIALECTIC.\n\nBy the ancients, Logic and Dialectic were used as synonymous terms;\nalthough [Greek: logizesthai], \"to think over, to consider, to\ncalculate,\" and [Greek: dialegesthai], \"to converse,\" are two very\ndifferent things.\n\nThe name Dialectic was, as we are informed by Diogenes Laertius, first\nused by Plato; and in the _Phaedrus, Sophist, Republic_, bk. vii., and\nelsewhere, we find that by Dialectic he means the regular employment\nof the reason, and skill in the practice of it. Aristotle also uses\nthe word in this sense; but, according to Laurentius Valla, he was\nthe first to use Logic too in a similar way.[1] Dialectic, therefore,\nseems to be an older word than Logic. Cicero and Quintilian use the\nwords in the same general signification.[2]\n\n[Footnote 1: He speaks of [Greek: dyscherelai logicai], that is,\n\"difficult points,\" [Greek: protasis logicae aporia logicae]]\n\n[Footnote 2: Cic. _in Lucullo: Dialecticam inventam esse, veri et\nfalsi quasi disceptatricem. Topica_, c. 2: _Stoici enim judicandi vias\ndiligenter persecuti sunt, ea scientia, quam_ Dialecticen _appellant_.\nQuint., lib. ii., 12: _Itaque haec pars dialecticae, sive illam\ndisputatricem dicere malimus_; and with him this latter word appears\nto be the Latin equivalent for Dialectic. (So far according to \"Petri\nRami dialectica, Audomari Talaei praelectionibus illustrata.\" 1569.)]\n\nThis use of the words and synonymous terms lasted through the Middle\nAges into modern times; in fact, until the present day. But more\nrecently, and in particular by Kant, Dialectic has often been employed\nin a bad sense, as meaning \"the art of sophistical controversy\";\nand hence Logic has been preferred, as of the two the more innocent\ndesignation. Nevertheless, both originally meant the same thing; and\nin the last few years they have again been recognised as synonymous.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}
{"text": "It is a pity that the words have thus been used from of old, and that\nI am not quite at liberty to distinguish their meanings. Otherwise, I\nshould have preferred to define _Logic_ (from [Greek: logos], \"word\"\nand \"reason,\" which are inseparable) as \"the science of the laws of\nthought, that is, of the method of reason\"; and _Dialectic_ (from\n[Greek: dialegesthai], \"to converse\"--and every conversation\ncommunicates either facts or opinions, that is to say, it is\nhistorical or deliberative) as \"the art of disputation,\" in the modern\nsense of the word. It it clear, then, that Logic deals with a subject\nof a purely _\u00e0 priori_ character, separable in definition from\nexperience, namely, the laws of thought, the process of reason or the\n[Greek: logos], the laws, that is, which reason follows when it is\nleft to itself and not hindered, as in the case of solitary thought on\nthe part of a rational being who is in no way misled. Dialectic, on\nthe other hand, would treat of the intercourse between two rational\nbeings who, because they are rational, ought to think in common, but\nwho, as soon as they cease to agree like two clocks keeping exactly\nthe same time, create a disputation, or intellectual contest. Regarded\nas purely rational beings, the individuals would, I say, necessarily\nbe in agreement, and their variation springs from the difference\nessential to individuality; in other words, it is drawn from\nexperience.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}
{"text": "Logic, therefore, as the science of thought, or the science of the\nprocess of pure reason, should be capable of being constructed _\u00e0\npriori_. Dialectic, for the most part, can be constructed only _\u00e0\nposteriori_; that is to say, we may learn its rules by an experiential\nknowledge of the disturbance which pure thought suffers through the\ndifference of individuality manifested in the intercourse between\ntwo rational beings, and also by acquaintance with the means which\ndisputants adopt in order to make good against one another their own\nindividual thought, and to show that it is pure and objective. For\nhuman nature is such that if A. and B. are engaged in thinking in\ncommon, and are communicating their opinions to one another on any\nsubject, so long as it is not a mere fact of history, and A. perceives\nthat B.'s thoughts on one and the same subject are not the same as his\nown, he does not begin by revising his own process of thinking, so as\nto discover any mistake which he may have made, but he assumes that\nthe mistake has occurred in B.'s. In other words, man is naturally\nobstinate; and this quality in him is attended with certain results,\ntreated of in the branch of knowledge which I should like to call\nDialectic, but which, in order to avoid misunderstanding, I shall call\nControversial or Eristical Dialectic. Accordingly, it is the branch\nof knowledge which treats of the obstinacy natural to man. Eristic is\nonly a harsher name for the same thing.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}
{"text": "Controversial Dialectic is the art of disputing, and of disputing in\nsuch a way as to hold one's own, whether one is in the right or the\nwrong--_per fas et nefas_.[1] A man may be objectively in the right,\nand nevertheless in the eyes of bystanders, and sometimes in his own,\nhe may come off worst. For example, I may advance a proof of some\nassertion, and my adversary may refute the proof, and thus appear to\nhave refuted the assertion, for which there may, nevertheless, be\nother proofs. In this case, of course, my adversary and I change\nplaces: he comes off best, although, as a matter of fact, he is in the\nwrong.\n\n[Footnote 1: According to Diogenes Laertius, v., 28, Aristotle put\nRhetoric and Dialectic together, as aiming at persuasion, [Greek: to\npithanon]; and Analytic and Philosophy as aiming at truth. Aristotle\ndoes, indeed, distinguish between (1) _Logic_, or Analytic, as the\ntheory or method of arriving at true or apodeictic conclusions; and\n(2) _Dialectic_ as the method of arriving at conclusions that are\naccepted or pass current as true, [Greek: endoxa] _probabilia_;\nconclusions in regard to which it is not taken for granted that they\nare false, and also not taken for granted that they are true in\nthemselves, since that is not the point.

Finally (4) _Sophistic_ is the method in which the form of the\nconclusion is false, although it seems correct. These three last\nproperly belong to the art of Controversial Dialectic, as they have\nno objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay\nno regard to truth itself; that is to say, they aim at victory.\nAristotle's book on _Sophistic Conclusions_ was edited apart from the\nothers, and at a later date.

That we should\nregard as a matter of no moment, or, at any rate, of very secondary\nconsequence; but, as things are, it is the main concern. Our\ninnate vanity, which is particularly sensitive in reference to our\nintellectual powers, will not suffer us to allow that our first\nposition was wrong and our adversary's right. The way out of this\ndifficulty would be simply to take the trouble always to form a\ncorrect judgment. For this a man would have to think before he spoke.\nBut, with most men, innate vanity is accompanied by loquacity and\ninnate dishonesty. They speak before they think; and even though they\nmay afterwards perceive that they are wrong, and that what they assert\nis false, they want it to seem the contrary. The interest in truth,\nwhich may be presumed to have been their only motive when they stated\nthe proposition alleged to be true, now gives way to the interests of\nvanity: and so, for the sake of vanity, what is true must seem false,\nand what is false must seem true.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

The\nargument which would have been our salvation did not occur to us at\nthe moment. Hence we make it a rule to attack a counter-argument, even\nthough to all appearances it is true and forcible, in the belief that\nits truth is only superficial, and that in the course of the dispute\nanother argument will occur to us by which we may upset it, or succeed\nin confirming the truth of our statement. In this way we are almost\ncompelled to become dishonest; or, at any rate, the temptation to do\nso is very great. Thus it is that the weakness of our intellect and\nthe perversity of our will lend each other mutual support; and that,\ngenerally, a disputant fights not for truth, but for his proposition,\nas though it were a battle _pro aris et focis_. He sets to work _per\nfas et nefas_; nay, as we have seen, he cannot easily do otherwise.\nAs a rule, then, every man will insist on maintaining whatever he\nhas said, even though for the moment he may consider it false or\ndoubtful.[1]", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

{"text": "To some extent every man is armed against such a procedure by his own\ncunning and villainy. He learns by daily experience, and thus comes\nto have his own _natural Dialectic_, just as he has his own _natural\nLogic_. But his Dialectic is by no means as safe a guide as his Logic.\nIt is not so easy for any one to think or draw an inference contrary\nto the laws of Logic; false judgments are frequent, false conclusions\nvery rare. A man cannot easily be deficient in natural Logic, but he\nmay very easily be deficient in natural Dialectic, which is a gift\napportioned in unequal measure. In so far natural Dialectic resembles\nthe faculty of judgment, which differs in degree with every man; while\nreason, strictly speaking, is the same. For it often happens that in\na matter in which a man is really in the right, he is confounded or\nrefuted by merely superficial arguments; and if he emerges victorious\nfrom a contest, he owes it very often not so much to the correctness\nof his judgment in stating his proposition, as to the cunning and\naddress with which he defended it.\n\nHere, as in all other cases, the best gifts are born with a man;\nnevertheless, much may be done to make him a master of this art by\npractice, and also by a consideration of the tactics which may be used\nto defeat an opponent, or which he uses himself for a similar purpose.\nTherefore, even though Logic may be of no very real, practical use,\nDialectic may certainly be so; and Aristotle, too, seems to me to\nhave drawn up his Logic proper, or Analytic, as a foundation and\npreparation for his Dialectic, and to have made this his chief\nbusiness. Logic is concerned with the mere form of propositions;\nDialectic, with their contents or matter--in a word, with their\nsubstance.

{"text": "Aristotle does not define the object of Dialectic as exactly as I\nhave done it here; for while he allows that its principal object\nis disputation, he declares at the same time that it is also the\ndiscovery of truth.[1] Again, he says, later on, that if, from the\nphilosophical point of view, propositions are dealt with according to\ntheir truth, Dialectic regards them according to their plausibility,\nor the measure in which they will win the approval and assent of\nothers.[2] He is aware that the objective truth of a proposition must\nbe distinguished and separated from the way in which it is pressed\nhome, and approbation won for it; but he fails to draw a sufficiently\nsharp distinction between these two aspects of the matter, so as to\nreserve Dialectic for the latter alone.[3] The rules which he often\ngives for Dialectic contain some of those which properly belong to\nLogic; and hence it appears to me that he has not provided a clear\nsolution of the problem.\n\n[Footnote 1: _Topica_, bk. i., 2.]\n\n[Footnote 2: _Ib_., 12.]\n\n[Footnote 3: On the other hand, in his book _De Sophisticis Elenchis_,\nhe takes too much trouble to separate _Dialectic_ from _Sophistic_\nand _Eristic_, where the distinction is said to consist in this, that\ndialectical conclusions are true in their form and their contents,\nwhile sophistical and eristical conclusions are false.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

Therefore, when Aristotle speaks of\n_Dialectic_, we must include in it Sophistic, Eristic, and Peirastic,\nand define it as \"the art of getting the best of it in a dispute,\" in\nwhich, unquestionably, the safest plan is to be in the right to begin\nwith; but this in itself is not enough in the existing disposition\nof mankind, and, on the other hand, with the weakness of the human\nintellect, it is not altogether necessary.

For truth\nis in the depths, [Greek: en butho hae halaetheia] (a saying of\nDemocritus, _Diog. Laert_., ix., 72). Two men often engage in a warm\ndispute, and then return to their homes each of the other's opinion,\nwhich he has exchanged for his own.

To form a clear idea of the province\nof Dialectic, we must pay no attention to objective truth, which is an\naffair of Logic; we must regard it simply as _the art of getting the\nbest of it in a dispute_, which, as we have seen, is all the easier if\nwe are actually in the right. In itself Dialectic has nothing to do\nbut to show how a man may defend himself against attacks of every\nkind, and especially against dishonest attacks; and, in the\nsame fashion, how he may attack another man's statement without\ncontradicting himself, or generally without being defeated. The\ndiscovery of objective truth must be separated from the art of winning\nacceptance for propositions; for objective truth is an entirely\ndifferent matter: it is the business of sound judgment, reflection and\nexperience, for which there is no special art.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

{"text": "Example 2.--I condemned the principle involved in the word _honour_\nas a foolish one; for, according to it, a man loses his honour by\nreceiving an insult, which he cannot wipe out unless he replies with a\nstill greater insult, or by shedding his adversary's blood or his own.\nI contended that a man's true honour cannot be outraged by what he\nsuffers, but only and alone by what he does; for there is no saying\nwhat may befall any one of us. My opponent immediately attacked\nthe reason I had given, and triumphantly proved to me that when a\ntradesman was falsely accused of misrepresentation, dishonesty, or\nneglect in his business, it was an attack upon his honour, which in\nthis case was outraged solely by what he suffered, and that he could\nonly retrieve it by punishing his aggressor and making him retract.\n\nHere, by a homonymy, he was foisting _civic honour_, which is\notherwise called _good name_, and which may be outraged by libel and\nslander, on to the conception of _knightly honour_, also called _point\nd'honneur_, which may be outraged by insult. And since an attack on\nthe former cannot be disregarded, but must be repelled by public\ndisproof, so, with the same justification, an attack on the latter\nmust not be disregarded either, but it must be defeated by still\ngreater insult and a duel. Here we have a confusion of two essentially\ndifferent things through the homonymy in the word _honour_, and a\nconsequent alteration of the point in dispute.\n\nIII.\n\nAnother trick is to take a proposition which is laid down relatively,\nand in reference to some particular matter, as though it were uttered\nwith a general or absolute application; or, at least, to take it in\nsome quite different sense, and then refute it. Aristotle's example is\nas follows:\n\nA Moor is black; but in regard to his teeth he is white; therefore, he\nis black and not black at the same moment. This is an obvious sophism,\nwhich will deceive no one. Let us contrast it with one drawn from\nactual experience.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}
{"text": "In talking of philosophy, I admitted that my system upheld the\nQuietists, and commended them.

My opponent did not attempt to refute this assertion\n_ad rem_, but contented himself by advancing the _argumentum ad\nhominem_, and telling me that I had just been praising the Quietists,\nand that they had written a good deal of nonsense too.\n\nThis I admitted; but, by way of correcting him, I said that I had\npraised the Quietists, not as philosophers and writers, that is to\nsay, for their achievements in the sphere of _theory_, but only as\nmen, and for their conduct in mere matters of _practice_; and that in\nHegel's case we were talking of theories. In this way I parried the\nattack.\n\nThe first three tricks are of a kindred character. They have this\nin common, that something different is attacked from that which was\nasserted. It would therefore be an _ignoratio elenchi_ to allow\noneself to be disposed of in such a manner.\n\nFor in all the examples that I have given, what the opponent says is\ntrue, but it stands in apparent and not in real contradiction with the\nthesis. All that the man whom he is attacking has to do is to deny the\nvalidity of his syllogism; to deny, namely, the conclusion which he\ndraws, that because his proposition is true, ours is false. In this\nway his refutation is itself directly refuted by a denial of his\nconclusion, _per negationem consequentiae_. Another trick is to refuse\nto admit true premisses because of a foreseen conclusion.

These rules are given by Aristotle in his _Topica_, bk.\nviii., c. 1.

The means which poetry uses for this end are\nthe exhibition of significant characters and the invention of\ncircumstances which will bring about significant situations, giving\noccasion to the characters to unfold their peculiarities and show what\nis in them; so that by some such representation a clearer and fuller\nknowledge of the many-sided idea of humanity may be attained. Beauty,\nhowever, in its general aspect, is the inseparable characteristic\nof the idea when it has become known. In other words, everything is\nbeautiful in which an idea is revealed; for to be beautiful means no\nmore than clearly to express an idea.\n\nThus we perceive that beauty is always an affair of _knowledge_, and\nthat it appeals to _the knowing subject_, and not to _the will_;\nnay, it is a fact that the apprehension of beauty on the part of the\nsubject involves a complete suppression of the will.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

Nay, with these forms\nof art it is not even conceivable, unless, indeed, the interest be of\nan entirely personal character, and confined to one or two spectators;\nas, for example, where a picture is a portrait of some one whom we\nlove or hate; the building, my house or my prison; the music, my\nwedding dance, or the tune to which I marched to the war. Interest of\nthis kind is clearly quite foreign to the essence and purpose of art;\nit disturbs our judgment in so far as it makes the purely artistic\nattitude impossible. It may be, indeed, that to a smaller extent this\nis true of all interest.\n\nNow, since the interest of a work of art lies in the fact that we\nhave the same kind of sympathy with a poetic representation as with\nreality, it is obvious that the representation must deceive us for the\nmoment; and this it can do only by its truth. But truth is an element\nin perfect art. A picture, a poem, should be as true as nature itself;\nbut at the same time it should lay stress on whatever forms the\nunique character of its subject by drawing out all its essential\nmanifestations, and by rejecting everything that is unessential and\naccidental. The picture or the poem will thus emphasize its _idea_,\nand give us that _ideal truth_ which is superior to nature.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

But since it is possible for reality to coincide with\nthe ideal, it is not actually necessary that this difference should\ndestroy the illusion. In the case of fine arts there is, in the range\nof the means which art adopts, a certain limit, and beyond it illusion\nis impossible. Sculpture, that is to say, gives us mere colourless\nform; its figures are without eyes and without movement; and painting\nprovides us with no more than a single view, enclosed within strict\nlimits, which separate the picture from the adjacent reality. Here,\nthen, there is no room for illusion, and consequently none for that\ninterest or sympathy which resembles the interest we have in reality;\nthe will is at once excluded, and the object alone is presented to us\nin a manner that frees it from any personal concern.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

I refer to _waxwork_. Here, we might say, is the dividing\nline which separates it from the province of fine art. When waxwork is\nproperly executed, it produces a perfect illusion; but for that very\nreason we approach a wax figure as we approach a real man, who, as\nsuch, is for the moment an object presented to our will. That is\nto say, he is an object of interest; he arouses the will, and\nconsequently stills the intellect. We come up to a wax figure with the\nsame reserve and caution as a real man would inspire in us: our will\nis excited; it waits to see whether he is going to be friendly to us,\nor the reverse, fly from us, or attack us; in a word, it expects some\naction of him. But as the figure, nevertheless, shows no sign of life,\nit produces the impression which is so very disagreeable, namely, of\na corpse. This is a case where the interest is of the most complete\nkind, and yet where there is no work of art at all. In other words,\ninterest is not in itself a real end of art.\n\nThe same truth is illustrated by the fact that even in poetry it is\nonly the dramatic and descriptive kind to which interest attaches; for\nif interest were, with beauty, the aim of art, poetry of the lyrical\nkind would, for that very reason, not take half so great a position as\nthe other two.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

This\napplies to many a drama which gives no true picture of the real life\nof man; which contains characters very superficially drawn, or so\ndistorted as to be actual monstrosities, such as are not to be found\nin nature; but the course of events and the play of the action are so\nintricate, and we feel so much for the hero in the situation in which\nhe is placed, that we are not content until we see the knot untangled\nand the hero rescued. The action is so cleverly governed and guided in\nits course that we remain in a state of constant curiosity as to what\nis going to happen, and we are utterly unable to form a guess; so that\nbetween eagerness and surprise our interest is kept active; and as we\nare pleasantly entertained, we do not notice the lapse of time. Most\nof Kotzebue's plays are of this character. For the mob this is the\nright thing: it looks for amusement, something to pass the time, not\nfor intellectual perception. Beauty is an affair of such perception;\nhence sensibility to beauty varies as much as the intellectual\nfaculties themselves.

On\nthe other hand, works of which the value lies in their beauty gain by\nrepetition, as they are then more and more understood.\n\nMost novels are on the same footing as dramatic representations of\nthis character. They are creatures of the same sort of imagination as\nwe see in the story-teller of Venice and Naples, who lays a hat on the\nground and waits until an audience is assembled. Then he spins a tale\nwhich so captivates his hearers that, when he gets to the catastrophe,\nhe makes a round of the crowd, hat in hand, for contributions, without\nthe least fear that his hearers will slip away.

The immortal masterpieces of Shakespeare contain\nlittle that excites interest; the action does not go forward in one\nstraight line, but falters, as in _Hamlet_, all through the play;\nor else it spreads out in breadth, as in _The Merchant of Venice_,\nwhereas length is the proper dimension of interest; or the scenes hang\nloosely together, as in _Henry IV_. Thus it is that Shakespeare's\ndramas produce no appreciable effect on the mob.\n\nThe dramatic requirement stated by Aristotle, and more particularly\nthe unity of action, have in view the interest of the piece rather\nthan its artistic beauty. It may be said, generally, that these\nrequirements are drawn up in accordance with the principle of\nsufficient reason to which I have referred above. We know, however,\nthat the _idea_, and, consequently, the beauty of a work of art, exist\nonly for the perceptive intelligence which has freed itself from\nthe domination of that principle. It is just here that we find the\ndistinction between interest and beauty; as it is obvious that\ninterest is part and parcel of the mental attitude which is governed\nby the principle, whereas beauty is always beyond its range.

That the Greek tragedians did\nnot look to interest as a means of working upon the public, is clear\nfrom the fact that the material of their masterpieces was almost\nalways known to every one: they selected events which had often been\ntreated dramatically before. This shows us how sensitive was the\nGreek public to the beautiful, as it did not require the interest of\nunexpected events and new stories to season its enjoyment.\n\nNeither does the quality of interest often attach to masterpieces of\ndescriptive poetry. Father Homer lays the world and humanity before us\nin its true nature, but he takes no trouble to attract our sympathy\nby a complexity of circumstance, or to surprise us by unexpected\nentanglements. His pace is lingering; he stops at every scene; he puts\none picture after another tranquilly before us, elaborating it\nwith care. We experience no passionate emotion in reading him; our\ndemeanour is one of pure perceptive intelligence; he does not arouse\nour will, but sings it to rest; and it costs us no effort to break off\nin our reading, for we are not in condition of eager curiosity. This\nis all still more true of Dante, whose work is not, in the proper\nsense of the word, an epic, but a descriptive poem. The same thing may\nbe said of the four immortal romances: _Don Quixote, Tristram Shandy,\nLa Nouvelle Helo\u00efse_, and _Wilhelm Meister_.

Nevertheless, a comparatively small admixture of the\nelement of interest may well be found to be most advantageous as far\nas beauty is concerned; for beauty is and remains the end of art.\nBeauty is in twofold opposition with interest; firstly, because it\nlies in the perception of the idea, and such perception takes its\nobject entirely out of the range of the forms enunciated by the\nprinciple of sufficient reason; whereas interest has its sphere mainly\nin circumstance, and it is out of this principle that the complexity\nof circumstance arises. Secondly, interest works by exciting the will;\nwhereas beauty exists only for the pure perceptive intelligence, which\nhas no will. However, with dramatic and descriptive literature an\nadmixture of interest is necessary, just as a volatile and gaseous\nsubstance requires a material basis if it is to be preserved and\ntransferred. The admixture is necessary, partly, indeed, because\ninterest is itself created by the events which have to be devised in\norder to set the characters in motion; partly because our minds would\nbe weary of watching scene after scene if they had no concern for us,\nor of passing from one significant picture to another if we were not\ndrawn on by some secret thread. It is this that we call interest;\nit is the sympathy which the event in itself forces us to feel, and\nwhich, by riveting our attention, makes the mind obedient to the poet,\nand able to follow him into all the parts of his story.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}
{"text": "If the interest of a work of art is sufficient to achieve this result,\nit does all that can be required of it; for its only service is to\nconnect the pictures by which the poet desires to communicate a\nknowledge of the idea, as if they were pearls, and interest were the\nthread that holds them together, and makes an ornament out of the\nwhole. But interest is prejudicial to beauty as soon as it oversteps\nthis limit; and this is the case if we are so led away by the interest\nof a work that whenever we come to any detailed description in a\nnovel, or any lengthy reflection on the part of a character in a\ndrama, we grow impatient and want to put spurs to our author, so that\nwe may follow the development of events with greater speed. Epic and\ndramatic writings, where beauty and interest are both present in a\nhigh degree, may be compared to the working of a watch, where interest\nis the spring which keeps all the wheels in motion. If it worked\nunhindered, the watch would run down in a few minutes. Beauty, holding\nus in the spell of description and reflection, is like the barrel\nwhich checks its movement.\n\nOr we may say that interest is the body of a poetic work, and beauty\nthe soul. In the epic and the drama, interest, as a necessary quality\nof the action, is the matter; and beauty, the form that requires the\nmatter in order to be visible.\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.\n\nIn the moment when a great affliction overtakes us, we are hurt to\nfind that the world about us is unconcerned and goes its own way.

With objects which have no such\nbearing there sounds within them a constant note: _It is nothing to\nme_, which is the fundamental base in all their music.

The only kind of knowledge that is useful to the will is the\nknowledge that a given effect is produced by a certain cause. Genius\nitself is a kind of knowledge, namely, of ideas; and it is a knowledge\nwhich is unconcerned with any principle of causation. The man who is\ndevoted to knowledge of this character is not employed in the business\nof the will. Nay, every man who is devoted to the purely objective\ncontemplation of the world (and it is this that is meant by the\nknowledge of ideas) completely loses sight of his will and its\nobjects, and pays no further regard to the interests of his own\nperson, but becomes a pure intelligence free of any admixture of will.\n\nWhere, then, devotion to the intellect predominates over concern for\nthe will and its objects, it shows that the man's will is not the\nprincipal element in his being, but that in proportion to his\nintelligence it is weak. Violent desire, which is the root of all\nvice, never allows a man to arrive at the pure and disinterested\ncontemplation of the world, free from any relation to the will, such\nas constitutes the quality of genius; but here the intelligence\nremains the constant slave of the will.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

With violent, passionate men the same thing may also\nhappen, but it arises from a different cause, and may be easily\ndistinguished by the fact that the eyes roll. Men of no genius at all\nhave no interest in the idea expressed by an object, but only in the\nrelations in which that object stands to others, and finally to their\nown person.

Certainly, no real man\nof genius ever does this, at least habitually, even though he is\nshort-sighted.\n\nWhat I have said will sufficiently illustrate the conflict between\ngenius and vice.

This knowledge of the world, the inmost being of which is\ncommunicable only in _ideas_, is common both to the genius and to the\nsaint. The distinction between the two is that the genius reveals his\nknowledge by rendering it in some form of his own choice, and the\nproduct is Art. For this the saint, as such, possesses no direct\nfaculty; he makes an immediate application of his knowledge to his own\nwill, which is thus led into a denial of the world.

{"text": "In the hierarchy of physical organisation, strength of will is\nattended by a corresponding growth in the intelligent faculties.

In other words, both the intellect and the will\nare strong, but the intellect is the stronger of the two. Unless, as\nhappens in the case of the saint, the intellect is at once applied to\nthe will, or, as in the case of the artist, it finds its pleasures in\na reproduction of itself, the will remains untamed. Any strength that\nit may lose is due to the predominance of pure objective intelligence\nwhich is concerned with the contemplation of ideas, and is not, as\nin the case of the common or the bad man, wholly occupied with the\nobjects of the will. In the interval, when the genius is no longer\nengaged in the contemplation of ideas, and his intelligence is again\napplied to the will and its objects, the will is re-awakened in all\nits strength. Thus it is that men of genius often have very violent\ndesires, and are addicted to sensual pleasure and to anger. Great\ncrimes, however, they do not commit; because, when the opportunity of\nthem offers, they recognise their idea, and see it very vividly and\nclearly. Their intelligence is thus directed to the idea, and so gains\nthe predominance over the will, and turns its course, as with the\nsaint; and the crime is uncommitted.\n\nThe genius, then, always participates to some degree in the\ncharacteristics of the saint, as he is a man of the same\nqualification; and, contrarily, the saint always participates to some\ndegree in the characteristics of the genius.", "source": "art_of_controversy.txt"}

Genius and sanctity are\nfar removed from good-nature, which is essentially weak in all its\nmanifestations.\n\nApart from all that I have said, so much at least is clear. What\nappears under the forms of time, space, and casuality, and vanishes\nagain, and in reality is nothing, and reveals its nothingness by\ndeath--this vicious and fatal appearance is the will. But what does\nnot appear, and is no phenomenon, but rather the noumenon; what\nmakes appearance possible; what is not subject to the principle of\ncausation, and therefore has no vain or vanishing existence, but\nabides for ever unchanged in the midst of a world full of suffering,\nlike a ray of light in a storm,--free, therefore, from all pain and\nfatality,--this, I say, is the intelligence. The man who is more\nintelligence than will, is thereby delivered, in respect of the\ngreatest part of him, from nothingness and death; and such a man is in\nhis nature a genius.\n\nBy the very fact that he lives and works, the man who is endowed\nwith genius makes an entire sacrifice of himself in the interests\nof everyone.

The worst titles are those that\nare stolen, such titles that is to say that other books already bear;\nfor in the first place they are a plagiarism, and in the second a most\nconvincing proof of an absolute want of originality. A man who has not\nenough originality to think out a new title for his book will be much\nless capable of giving it new contents. Akin to these are those titles\nwhich have been imitated, in other words, half stolen; for instance, a\nlong time after I had written \"On Will in Nature,\" Oersted wrote \"On\nMind in Nature.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA book can never be anything more than the impression of its author's\nthoughts.

{"text": "The matter of books is very various, as also are the merits conferred on\nbooks on account of their matter. All matter that is the outcome of\nexperience, in other words everything that is founded on fact, whether\nit be historical or physical, taken by itself and in its widest sense,\nis included in the term matter. It is the _motif_ that gives its\npeculiar character to the book, so that a book can be important whoever\nthe author may have been; while with form the peculiar character of a\nbook rests with the author of it. The subjects may be of such a nature\nas to be accessible and well known to everybody; but the form in which\nthey are expounded, _what_ has been thought about them, gives the book\nits value, and this depends upon the author. Therefore if a book, from\nthis point of view, is excellent and without a rival, so also is its\nauthor. From this it follows that the merit of a writer worth reading is\nall the greater the less he is dependent on matter--and the better known\nand worn out this matter, the greater will be his merit. The three great\nGrecian tragedians, for instance, all worked at the same subject.\n\nSo that when a book becomes famous one should carefully distinguish\nwhether it is so on account of its matter or its form.\n\nQuite ordinary and shallow men are able to produce books of very great\nimportance because of their _matter_, which was accessible to them\nalone.

And when B\u00fcrger said that \"people\nwould make learned expositions as to who Leonora really was,\" we see\nthis literally fulfilled in Goethe's case, for we now have many learned\nexpositions on Faust and the Faust legend.

This instantly\nnecessitates his giving up all idea of being _na\u00efve_, a privilege which\nbelongs to superior minds sensible of their superiority, and therefore\nsure of themselves. For instance, it is absolutely impossible for men of\nordinary intelligence to make up their minds to write as they think;\nthey resent the idea of their work looking too simple.

The result is, they put what they have to say\ninto forced and involved language, create new words and prolix periods\nwhich go round the thought and cover it up. They hesitate between the\ntwo attempts of communicating the thought and of concealing it. They\nwant to make it look grand so that it has the appearance of being\nlearned and profound, thereby giving one the idea that there is much\nmore in it than one perceives at the moment. Accordingly, they sometimes\nput down their thoughts in bits, in short, equivocal, and paradoxical\nsentences which appear to mean much more than they say (a splendid\nexample of this kind of writing is furnished by Schelling's treatises on\nNatural Philosophy); sometimes they express their thoughts in a crowd of\nwords and the most intolerable diffuseness, as if it were necessary to\nmake a sensation in order to make the profound meaning of their phrases\nintelligible--while it is quite a simple idea if not a trivial one\n(examples without number are supplied in Fichte's popular works and in\nthe philosophical pamphlets of a hundred other miserable blockheads that\nare not worth mentioning), or else they endeavour to use a certain style\nin writing which it has pleased them to adopt--for example, a style that\nis so thoroughly _Kat' e'xochae'u_ profound and scientific, where one is\ntortured to death by the narcotic effect of long-spun periods that are\nvoid of all thought (examples of this are specially supplied by those\nmost impertinent of all mortals, the Hegelians in their Hegel newspaper\ncommonly known as _Jahrb\u00fccher der wissenschaftlichen Literatur)_; or\nagain, they aim at an intellectual style where it seems then as if they\nwish to go crazy, and so on.

It is amusing to see how, with this aim in view, first\nthis mannerism and then that is tried; these they intend to represent\nthe mask of intellect: this mask may possibly deceive the inexperienced\nfor a while, until it is recognised as being nothing but a dead mask,\nwhen it is laughed at and exchanged for another.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

This mannerism was introduced by\nthe pseudo-philosophers of the Universities and may be discerned\neverywhere, even among the first literary notabilities of the age.

{"text": "while of those previously described writers it may be said, in the words\nof the same poet, _et qui parlant beaucoup ne disent jamais rien_. It is\nalso a characteristic of such writers to avoid, if it is possible,\nexpressing themselves _definitely_, so that they may be always able in\ncase of need to get out of a difficulty; this is why they always choose\nthe more _abstract_ expressions: while people of intellect choose the\nmore _concrete_; because the latter bring the matter closer to view,\nwhich is the source of all evidence. This preference for abstract\nexpressions may be confirmed by numerous examples: a specially\nridiculous example is the following. Throughout German literature of the\nlast ten years we find \"to condition\" almost everywhere used in place of\n\"to cause\" or \"to effect.\" Since it is more abstract and indefinite it\nsays less than it implies, and consequently leaves a little back door\nopen to please those whose secret consciousness of their own incapacity\ninspires them with a continual fear of all _definite_ expressions. While\nwith other people it is merely the effect of that national tendency to\nimmediately imitate everything that is stupid in literature and wicked\nin life; this is shown in either case by the quick way in which it\nspreads. The Englishman depends on his own judgment both in what he\nwrites and what he does, but this applies less to the German than to any\nother nation. In consequence of the state of things referred to, the\nwords \"to cause\" and \"to effect\" have almost entirely disappeared from\nthe literature of the last ten years, and people everywhere talk of \"to\ncondition.\" The fact is worth mentioning because it is\ncharacteristically ridiculous. Everyday authors are only half conscious\nwhen they write, a fact which accounts for their want of intellect and\nthe tediousness of their writings; they do not really themselves\nunderstand the meaning of their own words, because they take ready-made\nwords and learn them. Hence they combine whole phrases more than\nwords--_phrases banales_. This accounts for that obviously\ncharacteristic want of clearly defined thought; in fact, they lack the\ndie that stamps their thoughts, they have no clear thought of their own;\nin place of it we find an indefinite, obscure interweaving of words,\ncurrent phrases, worn-out terms of speech, and fashionable expressions.\nThe result is that their foggy kind of writing is like print that has\nbeen done with old type. On the other hand, intelligent people _really_\nspeak to us in their writings, and this is why they are able to both\nmove and entertain us. It is only intelligent writers who place\nindividual words together with a full consciousness of their use and\nselect them with deliberation. Hence their style of writing bears the\nsame relation to that of those authors described above, as a picture\nthat is really painted does to one that has been executed with stencil.\nIn the first instance every word, just as every stroke of the brush, has\nsome special significance, while in the other everything is done\nmechanically. The same distinction may be observed in music. For it is\nthe omnipresence of intellect that always and everywhere characterises\nthe works of the genius; and analogous to this is Lichtenberg's\nobservation, namely, that Garrick's soul was omnipresent in all the\nmuscles of his body. With regard to the tediousness of the writings\nreferred to above, it is to be observed in general that there are two\nkinds of tediousness--an objective and a subjective. The _objective_\nform of tediousness springs from the deficiency of which we have been\nspeaking--that is to say, where the author has no perfectly clear\nthought or knowledge to communicate. For if a writer possesses any clear\nthought or knowledge it will be his aim to communicate it, and he will\nwork with this end in view; consequently the ideas he furnishes are\neverywhere clearly defined, so that he is neither diffuse, unmeaning,\nnor confused, and consequently not tedious. Even if his fundamental idea\nis wrong, yet in such a case it will be clearly thought out and well\npondered; in other words, it is at least formally correct, and the\nwriting is always of some value. While, for the same reason, a work that\nis objectively _tedious_ is at all times without value. Again,\n_subjective_ tediousness is merely relative: this is because the reader\nis not interested in the subject of the work, and that what he takes an\ninterest in is of a very limited nature. The most excellent work may\ntherefore be tedious subjectively to this or that person, just as, _vice\nvers\ufffd_, the worst work may be subjectively diverting to this or that\nperson: because he is interested in either the subject or the writer of\nthe book.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

For instance, what\ndeclamation on the emptiness of human existence could be more impressive\nthan Job's: _Homo, natus de muliere, brevi vivit tempore, repletus\nmultis miseriis, qui, tanquam flos, egreditur et conteritur, et fugit\nvelut umbra_. It is for this very reason that the na\u00efve poetry of Goethe\nis so incomparably greater than the rhetorical of Schiller. This is also\nwhy many folk-songs have so great an effect upon us. An author should\nguard against using all unnecessary rhetorical adornment, all useless\namplification, and in general, just as in architecture he should guard\nagainst an excess of decoration, all superfluity of expression--in other\nwords, he must aim at _chastity_ of style. Everything that is redundant\nhas a harmful effect. The law of simplicity and na\u00efvet\u00e9 applies to all\nfine art, for it is compatible with what is most sublime.\n\nTrue brevity of expression consists in a man only saying what is worth\nsaying, while avoiding all diffuse explanations of things which every\none can think out for himself; that is, it consists in his correctly\ndistinguishing between what is necessary and what is superfluous. On the\nother hand, one should never sacrifice clearness, to say nothing of\ngrammar, for the sake of being brief. To impoverish the expression of a\nthought, or to obscure or spoil the meaning of a period for the sake of\nusing fewer words shows a lamentable want of judgment.

Without\ntroubling himself about his reader, he writes as if he were holding a\nmonologue; whereas it should be a dialogue, and, moreover, a dialogue in\nwhich he must express himself all the more clearly as the questions of\nthe reader cannot be heard. And it is for this very reason that style\nshould not be subjective but objective, and for it to be objective the\nwords must be written in such a way as to directly compel the reader to\nthink precisely the same as the author thought. This will only be the\ncase when the author has borne in mind that thoughts, inasmuch as they\nfollow the law of gravity, pass more easily from head to paper than from\npaper to head. Therefore the journey from paper to head must be helped\nby every means at his command. When he does this his words have a purely\nobjective effect, like that of a completed oil painting; while the\nsubjective style is not much more certain in its effect than spots on\nthe wall, and it is only the man whose fantasy is accidentally aroused\nby them that sees figures; other people only see blurs.

This is why the most eminent\nintellects have always been strongly averse to any kind of disturbance,\ninterruption and distraction, and above everything to that violent\ninterruption which is caused by noise; other people do not take any\nparticular notice of this sort of thing. The most intelligent of all the\nEuropean nations has called \"Never interrupt\" the eleventh commandment.\nBut noise is the most impertinent of all interruptions, for it not only\ninterrupts our own thoughts but disperses them.

If there were no other\nmeans of urging on an animal than by making this most disgraceful of all\nnoises, one would forgive its existence. But it is quite the contrary:\nthis cursed cracking of whips is not only unnecessary but even useless.\nThe effect that it is intended to have on the horse mentally becomes\nquite blunted and ineffective; since the constant abuse of it has\naccustomed the horse to the crack, he does not quicken his pace for it.\nThis is especially noticeable in the unceasing crack of the whip which\ncomes from an empty vehicle as it is being driven at its slowest rate to\npick up a fare. The slightest touch with the whip would be more\neffective.

While the\nchild's mind has made a very few observations one inculcates it with\nideas and opinions, which are, strictly speaking, prejudices. His\nobservations and experience are developed through this ready-made\napparatus instead of his ideas being developed out of his own\nobservations. In viewing the world one sees many things from many sides,\nconsequently this is not such a short or quick way of learning as that\nwhich makes use of abstract ideas, and quickly comes to a decision about\neverything; therefore preconceived ideas will not be rectified until\nlate, or it may be they are never rectified. For, when a man's view\ncontradicts his ideas, he will reject at the outset what it renders\nevident as one-sided, nay, he will deny it and shut his eyes to it, so\nthat his preconceived ideas may remain unaffected. And so it happens\nthat many men go through life full of oddities, caprices, fancies, and\nprejudices, until they finally become fixed ideas. He has never\nattempted to abstract fundamental ideas from his own observations and\nexperience, because he has got everything ready-made from other people;\nand it is for this very reason that he and countless others are so\ninsipid and shallow. Instead of such a system, the natural system of\neducation should be employed in educating children. No idea should be\nimpregnated but what has come through the medium of observations, or at\nany rate been verified by them. A child would have fewer ideas, but they\nwould be well-grounded and correct. It would learn to measure things\naccording to its own standard and not according to another's. It would\nthen never acquire a thousand whims and prejudices which must be\neradicated by the greater part of subsequent experience and education.\nIts mind would henceforth be accustomed to thoroughness and clearness;\nthe child would rely on its own judgment, and be free from prejudices.\nAnd, in general, children should not get to know life, in any aspect\nwhatever, from the copy before they have learnt it from the original.\nInstead, therefore, of hastening to place mere books in their hands, one\nshould make them gradually acquainted with things and the circumstances\nof human life, and above everything one should take care to guide them\nto a clear grasp of reality, and to teach them to obtain their ideas\ndirectly from the real world, and to form them in keeping with it--but\nnot to get them from elsewhere, as from books, fables, or what others\nhave said--and then later to make use of such ready-made ideas in real\nlife. The result will be that their heads are full of chimeras and that\nsome will have a wrong comprehension of things, and others will\nfruitlessly endeavour to remodel the world according to those chimeras,\nand so get on to wrong paths both in theory and practice. For it is\nincredible how much harm is done by false notions which have been\nimplanted early in life, only to develop later on into prejudices; the\nlater education which we get from the world and real life must be\nemployed in eradicating these early ideas.

For to read in every spare moment, and to read\nconstantly, is more paralysing to the mind than constant manual work,\nwhich, at any rate, allows one to follow one's own thoughts. Just as a\nspring, through the continual pressure of a foreign body, at last loses\nits elasticity, so does the mind if it has another person's thoughts\ncontinually forced upon it. And just as one spoils the stomach by\noverfeeding and thereby impairs the whole body, so can one overload and\nchoke the mind by giving it too much nourishment. For the more one reads\nthe fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a\ntablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to\nreflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one\nhas read if one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later,\nwhat has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost.\nIndeed, it is the same with mental as with bodily food: scarcely the\nfifth part of what a man takes is assimilated; the remainder passes off\nin evaporation, respiration, and the like.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

On the other hand, women are inferior to men in\nmatters of justice, honesty, and conscientiousness. Again, because their\nreasoning faculty is weak, things clearly visible and real, and\nbelonging to the present, exercise a power over them which is rarely\ncounteracted by abstract thoughts, fixed maxims, or firm resolutions, in\ngeneral, by regard for the past and future or by consideration for what\nis absent and remote. Accordingly they have the first and principal\nqualities of virtue, but they lack the secondary qualities which are\noften a necessary instrument in developing it. Women may be compared in\nthis respect to an organism that has a liver but no gall-bladder.[9] So\nthat it will be found that the fundamental fault in the character of\nwomen is that they have no \"_sense of justice_.\" This arises from their\ndeficiency in the power of reasoning already referred to, and\nreflection, but is also partly due to the fact that Nature has not\ndestined them, as the weaker sex, to be dependent on strength but on\ncunning; this is why they are instinctively crafty, and have an\nineradicable tendency to lie.

Hence,\ndissimulation is innate in woman and almost as characteristic of the\nvery stupid as of the clever. Accordingly, it is as natural for women to\ndissemble at every opportunity as it is for those animals to turn to\ntheir weapons when they are attacked; and they feel in doing so that in\na certain measure they are only making use of their rights. Therefore a\nwoman who is perfectly truthful and does not dissemble is perhaps an\nimpossibility. This is why they see through dissimulation in others so\neasily; therefore it is not advisable to attempt it with them.

Neither for\nmusic, nor for poetry, nor for fine art have they any real or true sense\nand susceptibility, and it is mere mockery on their part, in their\ndesire to please, if they affect any such thing.\n\nThis makes them incapable of taking a purely objective interest in\nanything, and the reason for it is, I fancy, as follows.

Still, they\nhave not a single great painting to show, for the simple reason that\nthey lack that objectivity of mind which is precisely what is so\ndirectly necessary in painting.

The difference between the positive and\nnegative poles, according to polarity, is not merely qualitative but\nalso quantitative. And it was in this light that the ancients and people\nof the East regarded woman; they recognised her true position better\nthan we, with our old French ideas of gallantry and absurd veneration,\nthat highest product of Christian-Teutonic stupidity.

The consequences of this _fausse position_ are\nsufficiently clear. Accordingly, it would be a very desirable thing if\nthis Number Two of the human race in Europe were assigned her natural\nposition, and the lady-grievance got rid of, which is not only ridiculed\nby the whole of Asia, but would have been equally ridiculed by Greece\nand Rome.

Therefore, whilst among polygamous nations\nevery woman finds maintenance, where monogamy exists the number of\nmarried women is limited, and a countless number of women who are\nwithout support remain over; those in the upper classes vegetate as\nuseless old maids, those in the lower are reduced to very hard work of a\ndistasteful nature, or become prostitutes, and lead a life which is as\njoyless as it is void of honour. But under such circumstances they\nbecome a necessity to the masculine sex; so that their position is\nopenly recognised as a special means for protecting from seduction those\nother women favoured by fate either to have found husbands, or who hope\nto find them. In London alone there are 80,000 prostitutes. Then what\nare these women who have come too quickly to this most terrible end but\nhuman sacrifices on the altar of monogamy? The women here referred to\nand who are placed in this wretched position are the inevitable\ncounterbalance to the European lady, with her pretensions and arrogance.\nHence polygamy is a real benefit to the female sex, taking it _as a\nwhole_. And, on the other hand, there is no reason why a man whose wife\nsuffers from chronic illness, or remains barren, or has gradually become\ntoo old for him, should not take a second. Many people become converts\nto Mormonism for the precise reasons that they condemn the unnatural\ninstitution of monogamy. The conferring of unnatural rights upon women\nhas imposed unnatural duties upon them, the violation of which, however,\nmakes them unhappy. For example, many a man thinks marriage unadvisable\nas far as his social standing and monetary position are concerned,\nunless he contracts a brilliant match. He will then wish to win a woman\nof his own choice under different conditions, namely, under those which\nwill render safe her future and that of her children. Be the conditions\never so just, reasonable, and adequate, and she consents by giving up\nthose undue privileges which marriage, as the basis of civil society,\nalone can bestow, she must to a certain extent lose her honour and lead\na life of loneliness; since human nature makes us dependent on the\nopinion of others in a way that is completely out of proportion to its\nvalue. While, if the woman does not consent, she runs the risk of being\ncompelled to marry a man she dislikes, or of shrivelling up into an old\nmaid; for the time allotted to her to find a home is very short. In view\nof this side of the institution of monogamy, Thomasius's profoundly\nlearned treatise, _de Concubinatu_, is well worth reading, for it shows\nthat, among all nations, and in all ages, down to the Lutheran\nReformation, concubinage was allowed, nay, that it was an institution,\nin a certain measure even recognised by law and associated with no\ndishonour. And it held this position until the Lutheran Reformation,\nwhen it was recognised as another means for justifying the marriage of\nthe clergy; whereupon the Catholic party did not dare to remain\nbehindhand in the matter.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

The\nMormons' standpoint is right.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn India no woman is ever independent, but each one stands under the\ncontrol of her father or her husband, or brother or son, in accordance\nwith the law of Manu.\n\nIt is certainly a revolting idea that widows should sacrifice themselves\non their husband's dead body; but it is also revolting that the money\nwhich the husband has earned by working diligently for all his life, in\nthe hope that he was working for his children, should be wasted on her\nparamours. _Medium tenuere beati_. The first love of a mother, as that\nof animals and men, is purely _instinctive_, and consequently ceases\nwhen the child is no longer physically helpless. After that, the first\nlove should be reinstated by a love based on habit and reason; but this\noften does not appear, especially where the mother has not loved the\nfather. The love of a father for his children is of a different nature\nand more sincere; it is founded on a recognition of his own inner self\nin the child, and is therefore metaphysical in its origin.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "In almost every nation, both of the new and old world, and even among\nthe Hottentots, property is inherited by the male descendants alone; it\nis only in Europe that one has departed from this. That the property\nwhich men have with difficulty acquired by long-continued struggling and\nhard work should afterwards come into the hands of women, who, in their\nwant of reason, either squander it within a short time or otherwise\nwaste it, is an injustice as great as it is common, and it should be\nprevented by limiting the right of women to inherit. It seems to me that\nit would be a better arrangement if women, be they widows or daughters,\nonly inherited the money for life secured by mortgage, but not the\nproperty itself or the capital, unless there lacked male descendants. It\nis men who make the money, and not women; therefore women are neither\njustified in having unconditional possession of it nor capable of\nadministrating it. Women should never have the free disposition of\nwealth, strictly so-called, which they may inherit, such as capital,\nhouses, and estates. They need a guardian always; therefore they should\nnot have the guardianship of their children under any circumstances\nwhatever. The vanity of women, even if it should not be greater than\nthat of men, has this evil in it, that it is directed on material\nthings--that is to say, on their personal beauty and then on tinsel,\npomp, and show. This is why they are in their right element in society.\nThis it is which makes them inclined to be _extravagant_, especially\nsince they possess little reasoning power. Accordingly, an ancient\nwriter says, \u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9.[10] Men's vanity, on\nthe other hand, is often directed on non-material advantages, such as\nintellect, learning, courage, and the like. Aristotle explains in the\n_Politics_[11] the great disadvantages which the Spartans brought upon\nthemselves by granting too much to their women, by allowing them the\nright of inheritance and dowry, and a great amount of freedom; and how\nthis contributed greatly to the fall of Sparta. May it not be that the\ninfluence of women in France, which has been increasing since Louis\nXIII.'s time, was to blame for that gradual corruption of the court and\ngovernment which led to the first Revolution, of which all subsequent\ndisturbances have been the result? In any case, the false position of\nthe female sex, so conspicuously exposed by the existence of the \"lady,\"\nis a fundamental defect in our social condition, and this defect,\nproceeding from the very heart of it, must extend its harmful influence\nin every direction. That woman is by nature intended to obey is shown by\nthe fact that every woman who is placed in the unnatural position of\nabsolute independence at once attaches herself to some kind of man, by\nwhom she is controlled and governed; this is because she requires a\nmaster. If she, is young, the man is a lover; if she is old, a priest.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

I., ch. 9.\n\nTHINKING FOR ONESELF.\n\nThe largest library in disorder is not so useful as a smaller but\norderly one; in the same way the greatest amount of knowledge, if it has\nnot been worked out in one's own mind, is of less value than a much\nsmaller amount that has been fully considered. For it is only when a man\ncombines what he knows from all sides, and compares one truth with\nanother, that he completely realises his own knowledge and gets it into\nhis power. A man can only think over what he knows, therefore he should\nlearn something; but a man only knows what he has pondered.\n\nA man can apply himself of his own free will to reading and learning,\nwhile he cannot to thinking. Thinking must be kindled like a fire by a\ndraught and sustained by some kind of interest in the subject. This\ninterest may be either of a purely objective nature or it may be merely\nsubjective. The latter exists in matters concerning us personally, but\nobjective interest is only to be found in heads that think by nature,\nand to whom thinking is as natural as breathing; but they are very rare.\nThis is why there is so little of it in most men of learning.\n\nThe difference between the effect that thinking for oneself and that\nreading has on the mind is incredibly great; hence it is continually\ndeveloping that original difference in minds which induces one man to\nthink and another to read. Reading forces thoughts upon the mind which\nare as foreign and heterogeneous to the bent and mood in which it may be\nfor the moment, as the seal is to the wax on which it stamps its\nimprint. The mind thus suffers total compulsion from without; it has\nfirst this and first that to think about, for which it has at the time\nneither instinct nor liking.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "On the other hand, when a man thinks for himself he follows his own\nimpulse, which either his external surroundings or some kind of\nrecollection has determined at the moment. His visible surroundings do\nnot leave upon his mind _one_ single definite thought as reading does,\nbut merely supply him with material and occasion to think over what is\nin keeping with his nature and present mood. This is why _much_ reading\nrobs the mind of all elasticity; it is like keeping a spring under a\ncontinuous, heavy weight. If a man does not want to think, the safest\nplan is to take up a book directly he has a spare moment.\n\nThis practice accounts for the fact that learning makes most men more\nstupid and foolish than they are by nature, and prevents their writings\nfrom being a success; they remain, as Pope has said,\n\n  \"For ever reading, never to be read.\"--_Dunciad_ iii. 194.\n\nMen of learning are those who have read the contents of books. Thinkers,\ngeniuses, and those who have enlightened the world and furthered the\nrace of men, are those who have made direct use of the book of the\nworld.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIndeed, it is only a man's own fundamental thoughts that have truth and\nlife in them. For it is these that he really and completely understands.\nTo read the thoughts of others is like taking the remains of some one\nelse's meal, like putting on the discarded clothes of a stranger.\n\nThe thought we read is related to the thought which rises in us, as the\nfossilised impress of a prehistoric plant is to a plant budding out in\nspring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReading is merely a substitute for one's own thoughts.

A man, therefore, should only read\nwhen the source of his own thoughts stagnates; which is often the case\nwith the best of minds.\n\nIt is sin against the Holy Spirit to frighten away one's own original\nthoughts by taking up a book. It is the same as a man flying from Nature\nto look at a museum of dried plants, or to study a beautiful landscape\nin copperplate. A man at times arrives at a truth or an idea after\nspending much time in thinking it out for himself, linking together his\nvarious thoughts, when he might have found the same thing in a book; it\nis a hundred times more valuable if he has acquired it by thinking it\nout for himself. For it is only by his thinking it out for himself that\nit enters as an integral part, as a living member into the whole system\nof his thought, and stands in complete and firm relation with it; that\nit is fundamentally understood with all its consequences, and carries\nthe colour, the shade, the impress of his own way of thinking; and comes\nat the very moment, just as the necessity for it is felt, and stands\nfast and cannot be forgotten.

His mind is impregnated from\nwithout, which then bears and brings forth its child. Truth that has\nbeen merely learned adheres to us like an artificial limb, a false\ntooth, a waxen nose, or at best like one made out of another's flesh;\ntruth which is acquired by thinking for oneself is like a natural\nmember: it alone really belongs to us.

{"text": "_Reading_ is thinking with some one else's head instead of one's own.\nBut to think for oneself is to endeavour to develop a coherent whole, a\nsystem, even if it is not a strictly complete one. Nothing is more\nharmful than, by dint of continual reading, to strengthen the current of\nother people's thoughts. These thoughts, springing from different minds,\nbelonging to different systems, bearing different colours, never flow\ntogether of themselves into a unity of thought, knowledge, insight, or\nconviction, but rather cram the head with a Babylonian confusion of\ntongues; consequently the mind becomes overcharged with them and is\ndeprived of all clear insight and almost disorganised. This condition of\nthings may often be discerned in many men of learning, and it makes them\ninferior in sound understanding, correct judgment, and practical tact to\nmany illiterate men, who, by the aid of experience, conversation, and a\nlittle reading, have acquired a little knowledge from without, and made\nit always subordinate to and incorporated it with their own thoughts.\n\nThe scientific _thinker_ also does this to a much greater extent.\nAlthough he requires much knowledge and must read a great deal, his mind\nis nevertheless strong enough to overcome it all, to assimilate it, to\nincorporate it with the system of his thoughts, and to subordinate it to\nthe organic relative unity of his insight, which is vast and\never-growing. By this means his own thought, like the bass in an organ,\nalways takes the lead in everything, and is never deadened by other\nsounds, as is the case with purely antiquarian minds; where all sorts of\nmusical passages, as it were, run into each other, and the fundamental\ntone is entirely lost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

One can sit down at any time and read, but\nnot--think. It is with thoughts as with men: we cannot always summon\nthem at pleasure, but must wait until they come.

We should not use force, but wait until\nthe mood appears of itself; it frequently comes unexpectedly and even\nrepeats itself; the different moods which possess us at the different\ntimes throwing another light on the matter. It is this long process\nwhich is understood by _a ripe resolution_. For the task of making up\nour mind must be distributed; much that has been previously overlooked\noccurs to us; the aversion also disappears, for, after examining the\nmatter closer, it seems much more tolerable than it was at first sight.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "And in theory it is just the same: a man must wait for the right moment;\neven the greatest mind is not always able to think for itself at all\ntimes. Therefore it is advisable for it to use its spare moments in\nreading, which, as has been said, is a substitute for one's own thought;\nin this way material is imported to the mind by letting another think\nfor us, although it is always in a way which is different from our own.\nFor this reason a man should not read too much, in order that his mind\ndoes not become accustomed to the substitute, and consequently even\nforget the matter in question; that it may not get used to walking in\npaths that have already been trodden, and by following a foreign course\nof thought forget its own. Least of all should a man for the sake of\nreading entirely withdraw his attention from the real world: as the\nimpulse and temper which lead one to think for oneself proceed oftener\nfrom it than from reading; for it is the visible and real world in its\nprimitiveness and strength that is the natural subject of the thinking\nmind, and is able more easily than anything else to rouse it. After\nthese considerations it will not surprise us to find that the thinking\nman can easily be distinguished from the book-philosopher by his marked\nearnestness, directness, and originality, the personal conviction of all\nhis thoughts and expressions: the book-philosopher, on the other hand,\nhas everything second-hand; his ideas are like a collection of old rags\nobtained anyhow; he is dull and pointless, resembling a copy of a copy.\nHis style, which is full of conventional, nay, vulgar phrases and\ncurrent terms, resembles a small state where there is a circulation of\nforeign money because it coins none of its own.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

It does not proceed from individuality, but from\n_existence_ in general; it is the essential in everything that exists,\nnay, it is _that_ whereby anything has existence at all; accordingly it\nis concerned and satisfied only with existence _in general_ and not with\nany definite individual existence; this is not its aim. It has the\nappearance of being so because it can attain consciousness only in an\nindividual existence, and consequently looks as if it were entirely\nconcerned with that. This is nothing but an illusion which has entangled\nthe individual; but by reflection, it can be dissipated and we ourselves\nset free. It is only _indirectly_ that the individual has this great\nlonging for existence; it is the will to live in general that has this\nlonging directly and really, a longing that is one and the same in\neverything. Since, then, existence itself is the free work of the will,\nnay, the mere reflection of it, existence cannot be apart from will, and\nthe latter will be provisionally satisfied with existence in general, in\nso far, namely, as that which is eternally dissatisfied can be\nsatisfied. The will is indifferent to individuality; it has nothing to\ndo with it, although it appears to, because the individual is _only_\ndirectly conscious of will in himself. From this it is to be gathered\nthat the individual carefully guards his own existence; moreover, if\nthis were not so, the preservation of the species would not be assured.\nFrom all this it follows that individuality is not a state of perfection\nbut of limitation; so that to be freed from it is not loss but rather\ngain.

The capacity for belief is strongest in childhood;\ntherefore one is most careful to take possession of this tender age.

{"text": "We have an analogy to this in India in the _Thugs_, a religious body\nquite recently suppressed by the English, who executed numbers of them.\nThey showed their regard for religion and veneration for the goddess\nKali by assassinating at every opportunity their own friends and\nfellow-travellers, so that they might obtain their possessions, and they\nwere seriously convinced that thereby they had accomplished something\nthat was praiseworthy and would contribute to their eternal welfare. The\npower of religious dogma, that has been inculcated early, is so great\nthat it destroys conscience, and finally all compassion and sense of\nhumanity. But if you wish to see with your own eyes, and close at hand,\nwhat early inoculation of belief does, look at the English. Look at this\nnation, favoured by nature before all others, endowed before all others\nwith reason, intelligence, power of judgment, and firmness of character;\nlook at these people degraded, nay, made despicable among all others by\ntheir stupid ecclesiastical superstition, which among their other\ncapacities appears like a fixed idea, a monomania. For this they have to\nthank the clergy in whose hands education is, and who take care to\ninculcate all the articles, of belief at the earliest age in such a way\nas to result in a kind of partial paralysis of the brain; this then\nshows itself throughout their whole life in a silly bigotry, making even\nextremely intelligent and capable people among them degrade themselves\nso that they become quite an enigma to us. If we consider how essential\nto such a masterpiece is inoculation of belief in the tender age of\nchildhood, the system of missions appears no longer merely as the height\nof human importunity, arrogance, and impertinence, but also of\nabsurdity; in so far as it does not confine itself to people who are\nstill in the stage of _childhood_, such as the Hottentots, Kaffirs,\nSouth Sea Islanders, and others like them, among whom it has been really\nsuccessful. While, on the other hand, in India the Brahmans receive the\ndoctrines of missionaries either with a smile of condescending approval\nor refuse them with a shrug of their shoulders; and among these people\nin general, notwithstanding the most favourable circumstances, the\nmissionaries' attempts at conversion are usually wrecked. An authentic\nreport in vol. xxi. of the _Asiatic Journal_ of 1826 shows that after so\nmany years of missionary activity in the whole of India (of which the\nEnglish possessions alone amount to one hundred and fifteen million\ninhabitants) there are not more than three hundred living converts to be\nfound; and at the same time it is admitted that the Christian converts\nare distinguished for their extreme immorality. There are only three\nhundred venal and bribed souls out of so many millions. I cannot see\nthat it has gone better with Christianity in India since then, although\nthe missionaries are now trying, contrary to agreement, to work on the\nchildren's minds in schools exclusively devoted to secular English\ninstruction, in order to smuggle in Christianity, against which,\nhowever, the Hindoos are most jealously on their guard. For, as has been\nsaid, childhood is the time, and not manhood, to sow the seeds of\nbelief, especially where an earlier belief has taken root. An acquired\nconviction, however, that is assumed by matured converts serves,\ngenerally, as only the mask for some kind of personal interest. And it\nis the feeling that this could hardly be otherwise that makes a man, who\nchanges his religion at maturity, despised by most people everywhere; a\nfact which reveals that they do not regard religion as a matter of\nreasoned conviction but merely as a belief inoculated in early\nchildhood, before it has been put to any test. That they are right in\nlooking at religion in this way is to be gathered from the fact that it\nis not only the blind, credulous masses, but also the clergy of every\nreligion, who, as such, have studied its sources, arguments, dogmas and\ndifferences, who cling faithfully and zealously as a body to the\nreligion of their fatherland; consequently it is the rarest thing in the\nworld for a priest to change from one religion or creed to another. For\ninstance, we see that the Catholic clergy are absolutely convinced of\nthe truth of all the principles of their Church, and that the\nProtestants are also of theirs, and that both defend the principles of\ntheir confession with like zeal. And yet the conviction is the outcome\nmerely of the country in which each is born: the truth of the Catholic\ndogma is perfectly clear to the clergy of South Germany, the Protestant\nto the clergy of North Germany. If, therefore, these convictions rest on\nobjective reasons, these reasons must be climatic and thrive like\nplants, some only here, some only there.

{"text": "_Phil._ So it appears. Still, I take a higher point of view, and have\nbefore me a more important object, namely, the progress of the knowledge\nof truth among the human race. It is a frightful condition of things\nthat, wherever a man is born, certain propositions are inculcated in his\nearliest youth, and he is assured that under penalty of forfeiting\neternal salvation he may never entertain any doubt about them; in so\nfar, that is, as they are propositions which influence the foundation of\nall our other knowledge and accordingly decide for ever our point of\nview, and if they are false, upset it for ever. Further, as the\ninfluences drawn from these propositions make inroads everywhere into\nthe entire system of our knowledge, the whole of human knowledge is\nthrough and through affected by them. This is proved by every\nliterature, and most conspicuously by that of the Middle Age, but also,\nin too great an extent, by that of the fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies. We see how paralysed even the minds of the first rank of all\nthose epochs were by such false fundamental conceptions; and how\nespecially all insight into the true substance and working of Nature was\nhemmed in on every side. During the whole of the Christian period Theism\nlay like a kind of oppressive nightmare on all intellectual effort, and\non philosophical effort in particular, hindering and arresting all\nprogress. For the men of learning of those epochs, God, devil, angels,\ndemons, hid the whole of Nature; no investigation was carried out to the\nend, no matter sifted to the bottom; everything that was beyond the most\nobvious _causal nexus_ was immediately attributed to these; so that, as\nPomponatius expressed himself at the time, _Certe philosophi nihil\nverisimile habent ad haec, quare necesse est, ad Deum, ad angelos et\ndaemones recurrere._ It is true that there is a suspicion of irony in\nwhat this man says, as his malice in other ways is known, nevertheless\nhe has expressed the general way of thinking of his age. If any one, on\nthe other hand, possessed that rare elasticity of mind which alone\nenabled him to free himself from the fetters, his writings, and he\nhimself with them, were burnt; as happened to Bruno and Vanini. But how\nabsolutely paralysed the ordinary mind is by that early metaphysical\npreparation may be seen most strikingly, and from its most ridiculous\nside, when it undertakes to criticise the doctrines of a foreign belief.\nOne finds the ordinary man, as a rule, merely trying to carefully prove\nthat the dogmas of the foreign belief do not agree with those of his\nown; he labours to explain that not only do they not say the same, but\ncertainly do not mean the same thing as his. With that he fancies in his\nsimplicity that he has proved the falsity of the doctrines of the alien\nbelief. It really never occurs to him to ask the question which of the\ntwo is right; but his own articles of belief are to him as _\u00e0 priori_\ncertain principles. The Rev. Mr. Morrison has furnished an amusing\nexample of this kind in vol. xx. of the _Asiatic Journal_ wherein he\ncriticises the religion and philosophy of the Chinese.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

It is _false_ that state, justice, and law cannot be\nmaintained without the aid of religion and its articles of belief, and\nthat justice and police regulations need religion as a complement in\norder to carry out legislative arrangements. It is _false_ if it were\nrepeated a hundred times. For the ancients, and especially the Greeks,\nfurnish us with striking _instantia in contrarium_ founded on fact. They\nhad absolutely nothing of what we understand by religion. They had no\nsacred documents, no dogma to be learnt, and its acceptance advanced by\nevery one, and its principles inculcated early in youth. The servants of\nreligion preached just as little about morals, and the ministers\nconcerned themselves very little about any kind of morality or in\ngeneral about what the people either did or left undone. No such thing.\nBut the duty of the priests was confined merely to temple ceremonies,\nprayers, songs, sacrifices, processions, lustrations, and the like, all\nof which aimed at anything but the moral improvement of the individual.\nThe whole of their so-called religion consisted, and particularly in the\ntowns, in some of the _deorum majorum gentium_ having temples here and\nthere, in which the aforesaid worship was conducted as an affair of\nstate, when in reality it was an affair of police. No one, except the\nfunctionaries engaged, was obliged in any way to be present, or even to\nbelieve in it. In the whole of antiquity there is no trace of any\nobligation to believe in any kind of dogma. It was merely any one who\nopenly denied the existence of the gods or calumniated them that was\npunished; because by so doing he insulted the state which served these\ngods; beyond this every one was allowed to think what he chose of them.\nIf any one wished to win the favour of these gods privately by prayer or\nsacrifice he was free to do so at his own cost and risk; if he did not\ndo it, no one had anything to say against it, and least of all the\nState. Every Roman had his own Lares and Penates at home, which were,\nhowever, at bottom nothing more than the revered portraits of his\nancestors. The ancients had no kind of decisive, clear, and least of all\ndogmatically fixed ideas about the immortality of the soul and a life\nhereafter, but every one in his own way had lax, vacillating, and\nproblematical ideas; and their ideas about the gods were just as\nvarious, individual, and vague. So that the ancients had really no\n_religion_ in our sense of the word. Was it for this reason that anarchy\nand lawlessness reigned among them? Is not law and civil order rather so\nmuch their work, that it still constitutes the foundation of ours? Was\nnot property perfectly secure, although it consisted of slaves for the\ngreater part?

Truth may also be compared in this respect to certain\nchemical stuffs which in themselves are gaseous, but which for official\nuses, as also for preservation or transmission, must be bound to a firm,\npalpable base, because they would otherwise volatilise. For example,\nchlorine is for all such purposes applied only in the form of chlorides.\nBut if truth, pure, abstract, and free from anything of a mythical\nnature, is always to remain unattainable by us all, philosophers\nincluded, it might be compared to fluorine, which cannot be presented by\nitself alone, but only when combined with other stuffs.

I may add as an explanation that the use of mystery has been\nattempted even in philosophy; for example, when Pascal, who was pietest,\nmathematician, and philosopher in one, says in this threefold character:\n_God is everywhere centre and nowhere periphery_. Malebranche has also\ntruly remarked, _La libert\u00e9 est un myst\u00e8re_. One might go further, and\nmaintain that in religions everything is really mystery.

Even if a really true philosophy took the place of\nreligion, at least nine-tenths of mankind would only accept it on\nauthority, so that it would be again a matter of belief; for Plato's\n\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 will always hold good. Authority,\nhowever, is only established by time and circumstances, so that we\ncannot bestow it on that which has only reason to commend it;\naccordingly, we must grant it only to that which has attained it in the\ncourse of history, even if it is only truth represented allegorically.\nThis kind of truth, supported by authority, appeals directly to the\nessentially metaphysical temperament of man--that is, to his need of a\ntheory concerning the riddle of existence, which thrusts itself upon\nhim, and arises from the consciousness that behind the physical in the\nworld there must be a metaphysical, an unchangeable something, which\nserves as the foundation of constant change. It also appeals to the\nwill, fears, and hopes of mortals living in constant need; religion\nprovides them with gods, demons, to whom they call, appease, and\nconciliate. Finally, it appeals to their moral consciousness, which is\nundeniably present, and lends to it that authenticity and support from\nwithout--a support without which it would not easily maintain itself in\nthe struggle against so many temptations. It is exactly from this side\nthat religion provides an inexhaustible source of consolation and\ncomfort in the countless and great sorrows of life, a comfort which does\nnot leave men in death, but rather then unfolds its full efficacy. So\nthat religion is like some one taking hold of the hand of a blind person\nand leading him, since he cannot see for himself; all that the blind\nperson wants is to attain his end, not to see everything as he walks\nalong.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Phil._ This side is certainly the brilliant side of religion. If it is\na _fraus_ it is indeed a _pia fraus_; that cannot be denied.

There can, at\nany rate, be a true philosophy, but there can be no true religion: I\nmean true in the real and proper understanding of the word, not merely\nin that flowery and allegorical sense which you have described, a sense\nin which every religion would be true only in different degrees.

One might regard this fact as the _monogram_ of\nthe moral world. Meanwhile let us not give up the hope that mankind will\nsome day attain that point of maturity and education at which it is able\nto produce a true philosophy on the one hand, and accept it on the\nother. _Simplex sigillum veri_: the naked truth must be so simple and\ncomprehensible that one can impart it to all in its true form without\nany admixture of myth and fable (a pack of lies)--in other words,\nwithout masking it as _religion_.\n\n_Demop._ You have not a sufficient idea of the wretched capacities of\nthe masses.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Phil._ I express it only as a hope; but to give it up is impossible. In\nthat case, if truth were in a simpler and more comprehensible form, it\nwould surely soon drive religion from the position of vicegerent which\nit has so long held.

This will be the\n_euthanasia_ of religion. However, as long as she lives she has two\nfaces, one of truth and one of deceit. According as one looks\nattentively at one or the other one will like or dislike her. Hence\nreligion must be regarded as a necessary evil, its necessity resting on\nthe pitiful weak-mindedness of the great majority of mankind, incapable\nof grasping the truth, and consequently when in extremity requires a\nsubstitute for truth.\n\n_Demop._ Really, one would think that you philosophers had truth lying\nin readiness, and all that one had to do was to lay hold of it.\n\n_Phil._ If we have not got it, it is principally to be ascribed to the\npressure under which philosophy, at all periods and in all countries,\nhas been held by religion.

I\nam sometimes shocked to see when I take into my hand the writings of\neven the most intelligent minds of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies, and especially if I have just left my oriental studies, how\nparalysed and hemmed in on all sides they are by Jewish notions.\nPrepared in this way, one cannot form any idea of the true philosophy!", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Demop._ And if, moreover, this true philosophy were discovered,\nreligion would not cease to exist, as you imagine. There cannot be one\nsystem of metaphysics for everybody; the natural differences of\nintellectual power in addition to those of education make this\nimpossible. The great majority of mankind must necessarily be engaged in\nthat arduous bodily labour which is requisite in order to furnish the\nendless needs of the whole race. Not only does this leave the majority\nno time for education, for learning, or for reflection; but by virtue of\nthe strong antagonism between merely physical and intellectual\nqualities, much excessive bodily labour blunts the understanding and\nmakes it heavy, clumsy, and awkward, and consequently incapable of\ngrasping any other than perfectly simple and palpable matters. At least\nnine-tenths of the human race comes under this category. People require\na system of metaphysics, that is, an account of the world and our\nexistence, because such an account belongs to the most natural\nrequirements of mankind. They require also a popular system of\nmetaphysics, which, in order for it to be this, must combine many rare\nqualities; for instance, it must be exceedingly lucid, and yet in the\nright places be obscure, nay, to a certain extent, impenetrable; then a\ncorrect and satisfying moral system must be combined with its dogmas;\nabove everything, it must bring inexhaustible consolation in suffering\nand death. It follows from this that it can only be true in _sensu\nallegorico_ and not in _sensu proprio_. Further, it must have the\nsupport of an authority which is imposing by its great age, by its\ngeneral recognition, by its documents, together with their tone and\nstatements--qualities which are so infinitely difficult to combine that\nmany a man, if he stopped to reflect, would not be so ready to help to\nundermine a religion, but would consider it the most sacred treasure of\nthe people. If any one wants to criticise religion he should always bear\nin mind the nature of the great masses for which it is destined, and\npicture to himself their complete moral and intellectual inferiority. It\nis incredible how far this inferiority goes and how steadily a spark of\ntruth will continue to glimmer even under the crudest veiling of\nmonstrous fables and grotesque ceremonies, adhering indelibly, like the\nperfume of musk, to everything which has come in contact with it. As an\nillustration of this, look at the profound wisdom which is revealed in\nthe Upanishads, and then look at the mad idolatry in the India of\nto-day, as is revealed in its pilgrimages, processions, and festivities,\nor at the mad and ludicrous doings of the Saniassi of the present time.\nNevertheless, it cannot be denied that in all this madness and absurdity\nthere yet lies something that is hidden from view, something that is in\naccordance with, or a reflection of the profound wisdom that has been\nmentioned. It requires this kind of dressing-up for the great brute\nmasses. In this antithesis we have before us the two poles of\nhumanity:--the wisdom of the individual and the bestiality of the\nmasses, both of which, however, find their point of harmony in the moral\nkingdom. Who has not thought of the saying from the Kurral--\"Vulgar\npeople look like men; but I have never seen anything like them.\" The\nmore highly cultured man may always explain religion to himself _cum\ngrano salis_; the man of learning, the thoughtful mind, may, in secret,\nexchange it for a philosophy. And yet _one_ philosophy would not do for\neverybody; each philosophy by the laws of affinity attracts a public to\nwhose education and mental capacities it is fitted. So there is always\nan inferior metaphysical system of the schools for the educated\nplebeians, and a higher system for the _\u00e9lite_. Kant's lofty doctrine,\nfor example, was degraded to meet the requirements of the schools, and\nruined by Fries, Krug, Salat, and similar people. In short, Goethe's\ndictum is as applicable here as anywhere: _One does not suit all_. Pure\nbelief in revelation and pure metaphysics are for the two extremes; and\nfor the intermediate steps mutual modifications of both in countless\ncombinations and gradations. The immeasurable differences which nature\nand education place between men have made this necessary.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

If it can't stand when looked at merely from the\ntheoretical--in other words, from its intellectual side, it appears, on\nthe other hand, from the moral side as the only means of directing,\ntraining, and pacifying those races of animals gifted with reason, whose\nkinship with the ape does not exclude a kinship with the tiger. At the\nsame time religion is, in general, a sufficient satisfaction for their\ndull metaphysical needs. You appear to me to have no proper idea of the\ndifference, wide as the heavens apart, of the profound breach between\nyour learned man, who is enlightened and accustomed to think, and the\nheavy, awkward, stupid, and inert consciousness of mankind's beasts of\nburden, whose thoughts have taken once and for all the direction of fear\nabout their maintenance, and cannot be put in motion in any other; and\nwhose muscular power is so exclusively exercised that the nervous power\nwhich produces intelligence is thereby greatly reduced. People of this\nkind must absolutely have something that they can take hold of on the\nslippery and thorny path of their life, some sort of beautiful fable by\nmeans of which things can be presented to them which their crude\nintelligence could most certainly only understand in picture and\nparable.

It would be an odd way to promote virtue\nthrough the medium of lies and deception. The flag to which I have sworn\nis truth.

Instead of insisting on that with\npedantic obstinacy, look at its great achievements in a practical way\nboth as regards morality and feelings, as a guide to conduct, as a\nsupport and consolation to suffering humanity in life and death. How\ngreatly you should guard against rousing suspicion in the masses by\ntheoretical wrangling, and thereby finally taking from them what is an\ninexhaustible source of consolation and comfort to them; which in their\nhard lot they need very much more than we do: for this reason alone,\nreligion ought not to be attacked.\n\n_Phil_. With this argument Luther could have been beaten out of the\nfield when he attacked the selling of indulgences; for the letters of\nindulgence have furnished many a man with irreparable consolation and\nperfect tranquillity, so that he joyfully passed away with perfect\nconfidence in the little packet of them which he firmly held in his hand\nas he lay dying, convinced that in them he had so many cards of\nadmission into all the nine heavens. What is the use of grounds of\nconsolation and peacefulness over which is constantly hanging the\nDamocles-sword of deception?

{"text": "_Demop_. How often must I repeat that religion is not a lie, but the\ntruth itself in a mythical, allegorical dress? But with respect to your\nplan of each man establishing his own religion, I had still something to\nsay to you, that a particularism like this is totally and absolutely\nopposed to the nature of mankind, and therefore would abolish all social\norder. Man is an _animal metaphysicum_--in other words, he has\nsurpassingly great metaphysical requirements; accordingly he conceives\nlife above all in its metaphysical sense, and from that standpoint\nwishes to grasp everything. Accordingly, odd as it may sound with regard\nto the uncertainty of all dogmas, accord in the fundamental elements of\nmetaphysics is the principal thing, in so much as it is only among\npeople who hold the same views on this question that a genuine and\nlasting fellowship is possible. As a result of this, nations resemble\nand differ from each other more in religion than in government, or even\nlanguage. Consequently, the fabric of society, the State, will only be\nperfectly firm when it has for a basis a system of metaphysics\nuniversally acknowledged. Such a system, naturally, can only be a\npopular metaphysical one--that is, a religion. It then becomes\nidentified with the government, with all the general expressions of the\nnational life, as well as with all sacred acts of private life. This was\nthe case in ancient India, among the Persians, Egyptians, Jews, also the\nGreeks and Romans, and it is still the case among the Brahman, Buddhist,\nand Mohammedan nations. There, are three doctrines of faith in China, it\nis true, and the one that has spread the most, namely, Buddhism, is\nexactly the doctrine that is least protected by the State; yet there is\na saying in China that is universally appreciated and daily applied,\n_the three doctrines are only one_--in other words, they agree in the\nmain thing. The Emperor confesses all three at the same time, and agrees\nwith them all. Europe is the confederacy of _Christian_ States;\nChristianity is the basis of each of its members and the common bond of\nall; hence Turkey, although it is in Europe, is really not to be\nreckoned in it. Similarly the European princes are such \"by the grace of\nGod,\" and the Pope is the delegate of God; accordingly, as his throne\nwas the highest, he wished all other thrones to be looked upon only as\nheld in fee from him. Similarly Archbishops and Bishops, as such, had\ntemporal authority, just as they have still in England a seat and voice\nin the Upper House; Protestant rulers are, as such, heads of their\nchurches; in England a few years ago this was a girl of eighteen. By the\nrevolt from the Pope, the Reformation shattered the European structure,\nand, in particular, dissolved the true unity of Germany by abolishing\nits common faith; this unity, which had as a matter of fact come to\ngrief, had accordingly to be replaced later by artificial and purely\npolitical bonds. So you see how essentially connected is unity of faith\nwith common order and every state. It is everywhere the support of the\nlaws and the constitution--that is to say, the foundation of the social\nstructure, which would stand with difficulty if faith did not lend power\nto the authority of the government and the importance of the ruler.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Phil_. Oh, yes, princes look upon God as a goblin, wherewith to\nfrighten grown-up children to bed when nothing else is of any avail; it\nis for this reason that they depend so much on God. All right; meanwhile\nI should like to advise every ruling lord to read through, on a certain\nday every six months, the fifteenth chapter of the First Book of Samuel,\nearnestly and attentively; so that he may always have in mind what it\nmeans to support the throne on the altar. Moreover, since burning at the\nstake, that _ultima ratio theologorum_, is a thing of the past, this\nmode of government has lost its efficacy. For, as you know, religions\nare like glowworms: before they can shine it must be dark. A certain\ndegree of general ignorance is the condition of every religion, and is\nthe element in which alone it is able to exist. While, as soon as\nastronomy, natural science, geology, history, knowledge of countries and\nnations have spread their light universally, and philosophy is finally\nallowed to speak, every faith which is based on miracle and revelation\nmust perish, and then philosophy will take its place. In Europe the day\nof knowledge and science dawned towards the end of the fifteenth century\nwith the arrival of the modern Greek philosophers, its sun rose higher\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which were so productive,\nand scattered the mists of the Middle Age. In the same proportion, both\nChurch and Faith were obliged to gradually disappear; so that in the\neighteenth century English and French philosophers became direct\nantagonists, until finally, under Frederick the Great, Kant came and\ntook away from religious belief the support it had formerly received\nfrom philosophy, and emancipated the _ancilla theologiae_ in that he\nattacked the question with German thoroughness and perseverance, whereby\nit received a less frivolous, that is to say, a more earnest tone. As a\nresult of this we see in the nineteenth century Christianity very much\nweakened, almost stripped entirely of serious belief, nay, fighting for\nits own existence; while apprehensive princes try to raise it up by an\nartificial stimulant, as the doctor tries to revive a dying man by the\naid of a drug. There is a passage from Condorcet's _Des Progr\u00e8s de\nl'esprit humain_, which seems to have been written as a warning to our\nepoch: _Le z\u00e8le religieux des philosophes et des grands n'\u00e9tait qu'une\nd\u00e9votion politique: et toute religion, qu'on se permet de d\u00e9fendre comme\nune croyance qu'il est utile de laisser au peuple, ne peut plus esp\u00e9rer\nqu'une agonie plus ou moins prolong\u00e9e_. In the whole course of the\nevents which I have pointed out you may always observe that belief and\nknowledge bear the same relation to each other as the two scales of a\nbalance: when the one rises the other must fall. The balance is so\nsensitive that it indicates momentary influences. For example, in the\nbeginning of this century the predatory excursions of French robbers\nunder their leader Buonaparte, and the great efforts that were requisite\nto drive them out and to punish them, had led to a temporary neglect of\nscience, and in consequence to a certain decrease in the general\npropagation of knowledge; the Church immediately began to raise her head\nagain and Faith to be revived, a revival partly of a poetical nature, in\nkeeping with the spirit of the times. On the other hand, in the more\nthan thirty years' peace that followed, leisure and prosperity promoted\nthe building up of science and the spread of knowledge in an exceptional\ndegree, so that the result was what I have said, the dissolution and\nthreatened fall of religion. Perhaps the time which has been so often\npredicted is not far distant, when religion will depart from European\nhumanity, like a nurse whose care the child has outgrown; it is now\nplaced in the hands of a tutor for instruction. For without doubt\ndoctrines of belief that are based only on authority, miracles, and\nrevelation are only of use and suitable to the childhood of humanity.\nThat a race, which all physical and historical data confirm as having\nbeen in existence only about a hundred times the life of a man sixty\nyears old, is still in its first childhood is a fact that every one will\nadmit.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

If instead of prophesying with undisguised pleasure the\ndownfall of Christianity, you would only consider how infinitely\nindebted European humanity is to it, and to the religion which, after\nthe lapse of some time, followed Christianity from its old home in the\nEast! Europe received from it a drift which had hitherto been unknown to\nit--it learnt the fundamental truth that life cannot be an\nend-in-itself, but that the true end of our existence lies beyond it.\nThe Greeks and Romans had placed this end absolutely in life itself, so\nthat, in this sense, they may most certainly be called blind heathens.\nCorrespondingly, all their virtues consist in what is serviceable to the\npublic, in what is useful; and Aristotle says quite na\u00efvely, \"_Those\nvirtues must necessarily be the greatest which are the most useful to\nothers_\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2,\n_Rhetor_. I. c. 9). This is why the ancients considered love for one's\ncountry the greatest virtue, although it is a very doubtful one, as it\nis made up of narrowness, prejudice, vanity, and an enlightened\nself-interest. Preceding the passage that has just been quoted,\nAristotle enumerates all the virtues in order to explain them\nindividually. They are _Justice, Courage, Moderation, Magnificence_\n(\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), _Magnanimity, Liberality, Gentleness, Reasonableness,\nand Wisdom_. How different from the Christian virtues! Even Plato,\nwithout comparison the most transcendental philosopher of pre-Christian\nantiquity, knows no higher virtue than _Justice_; he alone recommends it\nunconditionally and for its own sake, while all the other philosophers\nmake a happy life--_vita beata_--the aim of all virtue; and it is\nacquired through the medium of moral behaviour. Christianity released\nEuropean humanity from its superficial and crude absorption in an\nephemeral, uncertain, and hollow existence.\n\n                         ... _coelumque tueri\n  Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus_.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

And now look\nat this side, if you can. Look at the time when the Church had\nimprisoned the minds, and violence the bodies of men, whereby knights\nand priests could lay the whole weight of life on the common beast of\nburden--the third estate. There you have club-law, feudalism, and\nfanaticism in close alliance, and in their train shocking uncertainty\nand darkness of mind, a corresponding intolerance, discord of faiths,\nreligious wars, crusades, persecution of heretics and inquisitions; as\nthe form of fellowship, chivalry, an amalgam of savagery and\nfoolishness, with its pedantic system of absurd affectations, its\ndegrading superstitions, and apish veneration for women; the survival of\nwhich is gallantry, deservedly requited by the arrogance of women; it\naffords to all Asiatics continual material for laughter, in which the\nGreeks would have joined. In the golden Middle Age the matter went as\nfar as a formal and methodical service of women and enjoined deeds of\nheroism, _cours d'amour_, bombastic Troubadour songs and so forth,\nalthough it is to be observed that these last absurdities, which have an\nintellectual side, were principally at home in France; while among the\nmaterial phlegmatic Germans the knights distinguished themselves more by\ndrinking and robbing. Drinking and hoarding their castles with plunder\nwere the occupations of their lives; and certainly there was no want of\nstupid love-songs in the courts. What has changed the scene so?\nMigration and Christianity.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Demop_. It is a good thing you reminded me of it. Migration was the\nsource of the evil, and Christianity the dam on which it broke.\nChristianity was the means of controlling and taming those raw, wild\nhordes who were washed in by the flood of migration. The savage man must\nfirst of all learn to kneel, to venerate, and to obey; it is only after\nthat, that he can be civilised. This was done in Ireland by St. Patrick,\nin Germany by Winifred the Saxon, who was a genuine Boniface. It was\nmigration of nations, this last movement of Asiatic races towards\nEurope, followed only by their fruitless attempts under Attila, Gengis\nKhan, and Timur, and, as a comic after-piece, by the gipsies: it was\nmigration of nations which swept away the humanity of the ancients.\nChristianity was the very principle which worked against this savagery,\njust as later, through the whole of the Middle Age, the Church and its\nhierarchy were extremely necessary to place a limit to the savagery and\nbarbarism of those lords of violence, the princes and knights: it was\nthe ice-breaker of this mighty flood. Still, the general aim of\nChristianity is not so much to make this life pleasant as to make us\nworthy of a better. It looks beyond this span of time, this fleeting\ndream, in order to lead us to eternal salvation. Its tendency is ethical\nin the highest sense of the word, a tendency which had hitherto been\nunknown in Europe; as I have already pointed out to you by comparing the\nmorality and religion of the ancients with those of Christianity.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Phil_. That is right so far as theory is concerned; but look at the\npractice. In comparison with the Christian centuries that followed, the\nancient world was undoubtedly less cruel than the Middle Age, with its\ndeaths by frightful torture, its countless burnings at the stake;\nfurther, the ancients were very patient, thought very highly of justice,\nand frequently sacrificed themselves for their country, showed traits of\nmagnanimity of every kind, and such genuine humanity, that, up to the\npresent time, an acquaintance with their doings and thoughts is called\nthe study of Humanity. Religious wars, massacres, crusades,\ninquisitions, as well as other persecutions, the extermination of the\noriginal inhabitants of America and the introduction of African slaves\nin their place, were the fruits of Christianity, and among the ancients\none cannot find anything analogous to this, anything to counterpoise it;\nfor the slaves of the ancients, the _familia_, the _vernae_, were a\nsatisfied race and faithfully devoted to their masters, and as widely\ndistinct from the miserable negroes of the sugar plantations, which are\na disgrace to humanity, as they were in colour. The censurable\ntoleration of pederasty, for which one chiefly reproaches the morality\nof the ancients, is a trifle compared with the Christian horrors I have\ncited, and is not so rare among people of to-day as it appears to be.\nCan you then, taking everything into consideration, maintain that\nhumanity has really become morally better by Christianity?", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Demop_. If the result has not everywhere corresponded with the purity\nand accuracy of the doctrine, it may be because this doctrine has been\ntoo noble, too sublime for humanity, and its aim set too high: to be\nsure, it was much easier to comply with heathen morality or with the\nMohammedan. It is precisely what is most elevated that is the most open\nto abuse and deception--_abusus optimi pessimus_; and therefore those\nlofty doctrines have sometimes served as a pretext for the most\ndisgraceful transactions and veritable crimes. The downfall of the\nancient institutions, as well as of the arts and sciences of the old\nworld, is, as has been said, to be ascribed to the invasion of foreign\nbarbarians. Accordingly, it was inevitable that ignorance and savagery\ngot the upper hand; with the result that violence and fraud usurped\ntheir dominion, and knights and priests became a burden to mankind. This\nis partly to be explained by the fact that the new religion taught the\nlesson of eternal and not temporal welfare, that simplicity of heart was\npreferable to intellectual knowledge, and it was averse to all worldly\npleasures which are served by the arts and sciences. However, in so far\nas they could be made serviceable to religion they were promoted, and so\nflourished to a certain extent.\n\n_Phil_. In a very narrow sphere.

{"text": "_Phil_. It would really be an extremely useful inquiry if some one, with\nthe greatest frankness and impartiality, tried to weigh exactly and\naccurately the advantages and disadvantages derived from religions. To\ndo this, it would be necessary to have a much greater amount of\nhistorical and psychological data than either of us has at our command.\nAcademies might make it a subject for a prize essay.\n\n_Demop_. They will take care not to do that.\n\n_Phil_. I am surprised to hear you say that, for it is a bad look-out\nfor religion. Besides, there are also academies which make it a secret\ncondition in submitting their questions that the prize should be given\nto the competitor who best understands the art of flattering them. If\nwe, then, could only get a statistician to tell us how many crimes are\nprevented yearly by religious motives, and how many by other motives.\nThere would be very few of the former. If a man feels himself tempted to\ncommit a crime, certainly the first thing which presents itself to his\nmind is the punishment he must suffer for it, and the probability that\nhe will be punished; after that comes the second consideration, that his\nreputation is at stake. If I am not mistaken, he will reflect by the\nhour on these two obstacles before religious considerations ever come\ninto his mind. If he can get away from these two first safeguards\nagainst crime, I am convinced that religion _alone_ will very rarely\nkeep him back from it.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Demop_. I believe, however, that it will do so very often; especially\nwhen its influence works through the medium of custom, and thereby\nimmediately makes a man shrink from the idea of committing a crime.\nEarly impressions cling to him. As an illustration of what I mean,\nconsider how many a man, and especially if he is of noble birth, will\noften, in order to fulfil some promise, make great sacrifices, which are\ninstigated solely by the fact that his father has often impressed it\nupon him in childhood that \"a man of honour, or a gentleman, or a\ncavalier, always keeps his word inviolate.\"\n\n_Phil_. And that won't work unless there is a certain innate _probitas_.\nYou must not ascribe to religion what is the result of innate goodness\nof character, by which pity for the one who would be affected by the\ncrime prevents a man from committing it. This is the genuine moral\nmotive, and as such it is independent of all religions.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Demop_. But even this moral motive has no effect on the masses unless\nit is invested with a religious motive, which, at any rate, strengthens\nit. However, without any such natural foundation, religious motives\noften in themselves alone prevent crime: this is not a matter of\nsurprise to us in the case of the multitude, when we see that even\npeople of good education sometimes come under the influence, not indeed\nof religious motives, which fundamentally are at least allegorically\ntrue, but of the most absurd superstitions, by which they are guided\nthroughout the whole of their lives; as, for instance, undertaking\nnothing on a Friday, refusing to sit down thirteen at table, obeying\nchance omens, and the like: how much more likely are the masses to be\nguided by such things. You cannot properly conceive the great\nlimitations of the raw mind; its interior is entirely dark, especially\nif, as is often the case, a bad, unjust, and wicked heart is its\nfoundation. Men like these, who represent the bulk of humanity, must be\ndirected and controlled meanwhile, as well as possible, even if it be by\nreally superstitious motives, until they become susceptible to truer and\nbetter ones. Of the direct effect of religion, one may give as an\ninstance a common occurrence in Italy, namely, that of a thief being\nallowed to replace what he has stolen through the medium of his\nconfessor, who makes this the condition of his absolution. Then think of\nthe case of an oath, where religion shows a most decided influence:\nwhether it be because a man places himself expressly in the position of\na mere _moral being_, and as such regards himself as solemnly appealed\nto,--as seems to be the case in France, where the form of the oath is\nmerely \"_je le jure_\"; and among the Quakers, whose solemn \"yea\" or\n\"nay\" takes the place of the oath;--or whether it is because a man\nreally believes he is uttering something that will forfeit his eternal\nhappiness,--a belief which is obviously only the investiture of the\nformer feeling. At any rate, religious motives are a means of awakening\nand calling forth his moral nature. A man will frequently consent to\ntake a false oath, but suddenly refuse to do so when it comes to the\npoint; whereby truth and right come off victorious.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "_Phil_. But false oaths are still oftener sworn, whereby truth and right\nare trodden underfoot with the clear knowledge of all the witnesses of\nthe act. An oath is the jurist's metaphysical _pons asinorum_, and like\nthis should be used as seldom as ever possible. When it cannot be\navoided, it should be taken with great solemnity, always in the presence\nof the clergy--nay, even in a church or in a chapel adjoining the court\nof justice.... This is precisely why the French abstract formulary of\nthe oath is of no value. By the way, you are right to cite the oath as\nan undeniable example of the practical efficacy of religion. I must, in\nspite of everything you have said, doubt whether the efficacy of\nreligion goes much beyond this. Just think, if it were suddenly declared\nby public proclamation that all criminal laws were abolished; I believe\nthat neither you nor I would have the courage to go home from here alone\nunder the protection of religious motives. On the other hand, if in a\nsimilar way all religions were declared to be untrue; we would, under\nthe protection of the laws alone, live on as formerly, without any\nspecial increase in our fears and measures of precaution. But I will\neven go further: religions have very frequently a decidedly demoralising\ninfluence. It may be said generally that duties towards God are the\nreverse of duties towards mankind; and that it is very easy to make up\nfor lack of good behaviour towards men by adulation of God. Accordingly,\nwe see in all ages and countries that the great majority of mankind find\nit much easier to beg admission into Heaven by prayers than to deserve\nit by their actions. In every religion it soon comes to be proclaimed\nthat it is not so much moral actions as faith, ceremonies, and rites of\nevery kind that are the immediate objects of the Divine will; and indeed\nthe latter, especially if they are bound up with the emoluments of the\nclergy, are considered a substitute for the former. The sacrifice of\nanimals in temples, or the saying of masses, the erection of chapels or\ncrosses by the roadside, are soon regarded as the most meritorious\nworks; so that even a great crime may be expiated by them, as also by\npenance, subjection to priestly authority, confessions, pilgrimages,\ndonations to the temple and its priests, the building of monasteries and\nthe like; until finally the clergy appear almost only as mediators in\nthe corruption of the gods. And if things do not go so far as that,\nwhere is the religion whose confessors do not consider prayers, songs of\npraise, and various kinds of devotional exercise, at any rate, a partial\nsubstitute for moral conduct? Look at England, for instance, where the\naudacious priestcraft has mendaciously identified the Christian Sunday\nwith the Jewish Sabbath, in spite of the fact that it was ordained by\nConstantine the Great in opposition to the Jewish Sabbath, and even took\nits name, so that Jehovah's ordinances for the Sabbath--_i.e._, the day\non which the Almighty rested, tired after His six days' work, making it\ntherefore _essentially the last day_ of the week--might be conferred on\nthe Christian Sunday, the _dies solis_, the first day of the week which\nthe sun opens in glory, the day of devotion and joy. The result of this\nfraud is that in England \"Sabbath breaking,\" or the \"desecration of the\nSabbath,\" that is, the slightest occupation, whether it be of a useful\nor pleasurable nature, and any kind of game, music, knitting, or worldly\nbook, are on Sundays regarded as great sins. Must not the ordinary man\nbelieve that if, as his spiritual guides impress upon him, he never\nfails in a \"strict observance of the holy Sabbath and a regular\nattendance on Divine Service,\"--in other words, if he invariably whiles\naway his time on a Sunday, and never fails to sit two hours in church to\nlisten to the same Litany for the thousandth time, and to babble it with\nthe rest _a tempo_, he may reckon on indulgence in here and there little\nsins which he at times allows himself? Those devils in human form, the\nslave-owners and slave-traders in the Free States of North America (they\nshould be called the Slave States), are, in general, orthodox, pious\nAnglicans, who look upon it as a great sin to work on Sundays; and\nconfident in this, and their regular attendance at church, they expect\nto gain eternal happiness. The demoralising influence of religion is\nless problematical than its moral influence. On the other hand, how\ngreat and how certain that moral influence must be to make amends for\nthe horrors and misery which religions, especially the Christian and\nMohammedan religions, have occasioned and spread over the earth! Think\nof the fanaticism, of the endless persecutions, the religious wars, that\nsanguinary frenzy of which the ancients had no idea; then, think of the\nCrusades, a massacre lasting two hundred years, and perfectly\nunwarrantable, with its war-cry, _It is God's will_, so that it might\nget into its possession the grave of one who had preached love and\nendurance; think of the cruel expulsion and extermination of the Moors\nand Jews from Spain; think of the massacres, of the inquisitions and\nother heretical tribunals, the bloody and terrible conquests of the\nMohammedans in three different parts of the world, and the conquest of\nthe Christians in America, whose inhabitants were for the most part, and\nin Cuba entirely, exterminated; according to Las Casas, within forty\nyears twelve million persons were murdered--of course, all _in majorem\nDei gloriam_, and for the spreading of the Gospel, and because,\nmoreover, what was not Christian was not looked upon as human. It is\ntrue I have already touched upon these matters; but when in our day \"the\nLatest News from the Kingdom of God\" is printed, we shall not be tired\nof bringing older news to mind. And in particular, let us not forget\nIndia, that sacred soil, that cradle of the human race, at any rate of\nthe race to which we belong, where first Mohammedans, and later\nChristians, were most cruelly infuriated against the followers of the\noriginal belief of mankind; and the eternally lamentable, wanton, and\ncruel destruction and disfigurement of the most ancient temples and\nimages, still show traces of the monotheistic rage of the Mohammedans,\nas it was carried on from Marmud the Ghaznevid of accursed memory, down\nto Aureng Zeb, the fratricide, whom later the Portuguese Christians\nfaithfully tried to imitate by destroying the temples and the _auto da\nf\u00e9_ of the inquisition at Goa. Let us also not forget the chosen people\nof God, who, after they had, by Jehovah's express and special command,\nstolen from their old and faithful friends in Egypt the gold and silver\nvessels which had been lent to them, made a murderous and predatory\nexcursion into the Promised Land, with Moses at their head, in order to\ntear it from the rightful owners, also at Jehovah's express and repeated\ncommands, knowing no compassion, and relentlessly murdering and\nexterminating all the inhabitants, even the women and children (Joshua\nx., xi.); just because they were not circumcised and did not know\nJehovah, which was sufficient reason to justify every act of cruelty\nagainst them. For the same reason, in former times the infamous roguery\nof the patriarch Jacob and his chosen people against Hamor, King of\nShalem, and his people is recounted to us with glory, precisely because\nthe people were unbelievers. Truly, it is the worst side of religions\nthat the believers of one religion consider themselves allowed\neverything against the sins of every other, and consequently treat them\nwith the utmost viciousness and cruelty; the Mohammedans against the\nChristians and Hindoos; the Christians against the Hindoos, Mohammedans,\nAmericans, Negroes, Jews, heretics, and the like. Perhaps I go too far\nwhen I say _all_ religions; for in compliance with truth, I must add\nthat the fanatical horrors, arising from religion, are only perpetrated\nby the followers of the monotheistic religions, that is, of Judaism and\nits two branches, Christianity and Islamism. The same is not reported of\nthe Hindoos and Buddhists, although we know, for instance, that Buddhism\nwas driven out about the fifth century of our era by the Brahmans from\nits original home in the southernmost part of the Indian peninsula, and\nafterwards spread over the whole of Asia; yet we have, so far as I know,\nno definite information of any deeds of violence, of wars and cruelties\nby which this was brought about. This may, most certainly, be ascribed\nto the obscurity in which the history of those countries is veiled; but\nthe extremely mild character of their religion, which continually\nimpresses upon us to be forbearing towards _every living thing_, as well\nas the circumstance that Brahmanism properly admits no proselytes by\nreason of its caste system, leads us to hope that its followers may\nconsider themselves exempt from shedding blood to any great extent, and\nfrom cruelty in any form. Spence Hardy, in his excellent book on\n_Eastern Monachism_, p. 412, extols the extraordinary tolerance of the\nBuddhists, and adds his assurance that the annals of Buddhism furnish\nfewer examples of religious persecution than those of any other\nreligion. As a matter of fact, intolerance is only essential to\nmonotheism: an only god is by his nature a jealous god, who cannot\npermit any other god to exist. On the other hand, polytheistic gods are\nby their nature tolerant: they live and let live; they willingly\ntolerate their colleagues as being gods of the same religion, and this\ntolerance is afterwards extended to alien gods, who are, accordingly,\nhospitably received, and later on sometimes attain even the same rights\nand privileges; as in the case of the Romans, who willingly accepted and\nvenerated Phrygian, Egyptian, and other foreign gods. Hence it is the\nmonotheistic religions alone that furnish us with religious wars,\npersecutions, and heretical tribunals, and also with the breaking of\nimages, the destruction of idols of the gods; the overthrowing of Indian\ntemples and Egyptian colossi, which had looked on the sun three thousand\nyears; and all this because a jealous God had said: \"_Thou shalt make no\ngraven image_,\" etc. To return to the principal part of the matter: you\nare certainly right in advocating the strong metaphysical needs of\nmankind; but religions appear to me to be not so much a satisfaction as\nan abuse of those needs. At any rate we have seen that, in view of the\nprogress of morality, its advantages are for the most part\nproblematical, while its disadvantages, and especially the enormities\nwhich have appeared in its train, are obvious. Of course the matter\nbecomes quite different if we consider the utility of religion as a\nmainstay of thrones; for in so far as these are bestowed \"by the grace\nof God,\" altar and throne are closely related. Accordingly, every wise\nprince who loves his throne and his family will walk before his people\nas a type of true religion; just as even Machiavelli, in the eighteenth\nchapter of his book, urgently recommended religion to princes. Moreover,\nit may be added that revealed religions are related to philosophy,\nexactly as the sovereigns by the grace of God are to the sovereignty of\nthe people; and hence the two former terms of the parallel are in\nnatural alliance.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

{"text": "Every animal, and especially man, requires, in order to exist and get on\nin the world, a certain fitness and proportion between his will and his\nintellect. The more exact and true this fitness and proportion are by\nnature, the easier, safer, and pleasanter it will be for him to get\nthrough the world. At the same time, a mere approximation to this exact\npoint will protect him from destruction. There is, in consequence, a\ncertain scope within the limits of exactness and fitness of this\nso-called proportion. The normal proportion is as follows. As the object\nof the intellect is to be the light and guide of the will on its path,\nthe more violent, impetuous, and passionate the inner force of the will,\nthe more perfect and clear must be the intellect which belongs to it; so\nthat the ardent efforts of the will, the glow of passion, the vehemence\nof affection, may not lead a man astray or drive him to do things that\nhe has not given his consideration or are wrong or will ruin him; which\nwill infallibly be the case when a very strong will is combined with a\nvery weak intellect. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, that is\nto say, a weak and feeble will, can agree and get on with little\nintellect; a moderate will only requires a moderate intellect. In\ngeneral, any disproportion between the will and intellect--that is to\nsay, any deviation from the normal proportion referred to--tends to make\na man unhappy; and the same thing happens when the disproportion is\nreversed. The development of the intellect to an abnormal degree of\nstrength and superiority, thereby making it out of all proportion to the\nwill, a condition which constitutes the essence of true genius, is not\nonly superfluous but actually an impediment to the needs and purposes of\nlife. This means that, in youth, excessive energy in grasping the\nobjective world, accompanied by a lively imagination and little\nexperience, makes the mind susceptible to exaggerated ideas and a prey\neven to chimeras; and this results in an eccentric and even fantastic\ncharacter. And when, later, this condition of mind no longer exists and\nsuccumbs to the teaching of experience, the genius will never feel so\nmuch at home or take up his position in the everyday world or in civic\nlife, and move with the ease of a man of normal intellect; indeed, he is\noften more apt to make curious mistakes. For the ordinary mind is so\nperfectly at home in the narrow circle of its own ideas and way of\ngrasping things that no one can control it in that circle; its\ncapacities always remain true to their original purpose, namely, to look\nafter the service of the will; therefore it applies itself unceasingly\nto this end without ever going beyond it.

For _below_ this order of\nanimals the will is not so prominent, and has a less degree of\nobjectivation; but _above_ the higher order of animals, I mean in men,\nwe get reason, and with reason reflection, and with this the faculty for\ndissimulation, which immediately throws a veil over the actions of the\nwill.

{"text": "The ordinary man who has suffered injustice burns with a desire for\nrevenge; and it has often been said that revenge is sweet. This is\nconfirmed by the many sacrifices made merely for the sake of enjoying\nrevenge, without any intention of making good the injury that one has\nsuffered. The centaur Nessus utilised his last moments in devising an\nextremely clever revenge, and the fact that it was certain to be\neffective sweetened an otherwise bitter death. The same idea, presented\nin a more modern and plausible way, occurs in Bertolotti's novel, _Le\ndue Sorelle_ which has been translated into three languages. Walter\nScott expresses mankind's proneness to revenge in words as powerful as\nthey are true: \"Vengeance is the sweetest morsel to the mouth that ever\nwas cooked in hell!\" I shall now attempt a psychological explanation of\nrevenge. All the suffering that nature, chance, or fate have assigned to\nus does not, _ceteris paribus_, pain us so much as suffering which is\nbrought upon us by the arbitrary will of another. This is due to the\nfact that we regard nature and fate as the original rulers of the world;\nwe look upon what befalls us, through them, as something that might have\nbefallen every one else. Therefore in a case of suffering which arises\nfrom this source, we bemoan the fate of mankind in general more than we\ndo our own. On the other hand, suffering inflicted on us through the\narbitrary will of another is a peculiarly bitter addition to the pain or\ninjury caused, as it involves the consciousness of another's\nsuperiority, whether it be in strength or cunning, as opposed to our own\nweakness. If compensation is possible, it wipes out the injury; but that\nbitter addition, \"I must submit to that from you,\" which often hurts\nmore than the injury itself, is only to be neutralised by vengeance. For\nby injuring the man who has injured us, whether it be by force or\ncunning, we show our superiority, and thereby annul the proof of his.\nThis gives that satisfaction to the mind for which it has been\nthirsting. Accordingly, where there is much pride or vanity there will\nbe a great desire for revenge. But as the fulfilment of every wish\nproves to be more or less a delusion, so is also the wish for revenge.\nThe expected enjoyment is mostly embittered by pity; nay, gratified\nrevenge will often lacerate the heart and torment the mind, for the\nmotive which prompts the feeling of it is no longer active, and what is\nleft is the testimony of our wickedness.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

If we investigate further we shall understand more\nclearly what this involves. All amorous feeling immediately and\nessentially concentrates itself on health, strength, and beauty, and\nconsequently on youth; because the will above all wishes to exhibit the\nspecific character of the human species as the basis of all\nindividuality.

With this are bound up more special requirements,\nwhich we will consider individually later on, and with which, if there\nis any prospect of gratification, there is an increase of passion.\nIntense love, however, springs from a fitness of both individualities\nfor each other; so that the will, that is to say the father's character\nand the mother's intellect combined, exactly complete that individual\nfor which the will to live in general (which exhibits itself in the\nwhole species) has a longing--a longing proportionate to this its\ngreatness, and therefore surpassing the measure of a mortal heart; its\nmotives being in a like manner beyond the sphere of the individual\nintellect. This, then, is the soul of a really great passion. The more\nperfectly two individuals are fitted for each other in the various\nrespects which we shall consider further on, the stronger will be their\npassion for each other. As there are not two individuals exactly alike,\na particular kind of woman must perfectly correspond with a particular\nkind of man--always in view of the child that is to be born. Real,\npassionate love is as rare as the meeting of two people exactly fitted\nfor each other.

In fact, a certain aversion for\neach other may exist also. The reason of this is that a child begotten\nby them would physically or mentally have discordant qualities. In\nshort, the child's existence and nature would not be in harmony with the\npurposes of the will to live as it presents itself in the species.\n\nIn an opposite case, where there is no fitness of disposition,\ncharacter, and mental capacity, whereby aversion, nay, even enmity for\neach other exists, it is possible for love to spring up.

The beauty or ugliness of the other individual has nothing\nwhatever to do with this satisfaction in itself, that is in so far as it\nis a matter of pleasure based upon a pressing desire of the individual.\nThe regard, however, for this satisfaction, which is so zealously\npursued, as well as the careful selection it entails, has obviously\nnothing to do with the chooser himself, although he fancies that it has.\nIts real aim is the child to be born, in whom the type of the species is\nto be preserved in as pure and perfect a form as possible. For instance,\ndifferent phases of degeneration of the human form are the consequences\nof a thousand physical accidents and moral delinquencies; and yet the\ngenuine type of the human form is, in all its parts, always restored;\nfurther, this is accomplished under the guidance of the sense of beauty,\nwhich universally directs the instinct of sex, and without which the\nsatisfaction of the latter would deteriorate to a repulsive necessity.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "Accordingly, every one in the first place will infinitely prefer and\nardently desire those who are most beautiful--in other words, those in\nwhom the character of the species is most purely defined; and in the\nsecond, every one will desire in the other individual those perfections\nwhich he himself lacks, and he will consider imperfections, which are\nthe reverse of his own, beautiful. This is why little men prefer big\nwomen, and fair people like dark, and so on. The ecstasy with which a\nman is filled at the sight of a beautiful woman, making him imagine that\nunion with her will be the greatest happiness, is simply the _sense of\nthe species_. The preservation of the type of the species rests on this\ndistinct preference for beauty, and this is why beauty has such power.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "We will later on more fully state the considerations which this\ninvolves. It is really instinct aiming at what is best in the species\nwhich induces a man to choose a beautiful woman, although the man\nhimself imagines that by so doing he is only seeking to increase his own\npleasure. As a matter of fact, we have here an instructive solution of\nthe secret nature of all instinct which almost always, as in this case,\nprompts the individual to look after the welfare of the species. The\ncare with which an insect selects a certain flower or fruit, or piece of\nflesh, or the way in which the ichneumon seeks the larva of a strange\ninsect so that it may lay its eggs in _that particular place only_, and\nto secure which it fears neither labour nor danger, is obviously very\nanalogous to the care with which a man chooses a woman of a definite\nnature individually suited to him. He strives for her with such ardour\nthat he frequently, in order to attain his object, will sacrifice his\nhappiness in life, in spite of all reason, by a foolish marriage, by\nsome love-affair which costs him his fortune, honour, and life, even by\ncommitting crimes. And all this in accordance with the will of nature\nwhich is everywhere sovereign, so that he may serve the species in the\nmost efficient manner, although he does so at the expense of the\nindividual.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "Instinct everywhere works as with the conception of an end, and yet it\nis entirely without one. Nature implants instinct where the acting\nindividual is not capable of understanding the end, or would be\nunwilling to pursue it. Consequently, as a rule, it is only given\nprominently to animals, and in particular to those of the lowest order,\nwhich have the least intelligence. But it is only in such a case as the\none we are at present considering that it is also given to man, who\nnaturally is capable of understanding the end, but would not pursue it\nwith the necessary zeal--that is to say, he would not pursue it at the\ncost of his individual welfare. So that here, as in all cases of\ninstinct, truth takes the form of illusion in order to influence the\nwill....\n\nAll this, however, on its part throws light upon the instinct of\nanimals. They, too, are undoubtedly carried away by a kind of illusion,\nwhich represents that they are working for their own pleasure, while it\nis for the species that they are working with such industry and\nself-denial. The bird builds its nest; the insect seeks a suitable place\nwherein to lay its eggs, or even hunts for prey, which it dislikes\nitself, but which must be placed beside the eggs as food for the future\nlarvae; the bee, the wasp, and the ant apply themselves to their skilful\nbuilding and extremely complex economy. All of them are undoubtedly\ncontrolled by an illusion which conceals the service of the species\nunder the mask of an egotistical purpose.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "This is probably the only way in which to make the inner or subjective\nprocess, from which spring all manifestations of instinct, intelligible\nto us. The outer or objective process, however, shows in animals\nstrongly controlled by instinct, as insects for instance, a\npreponderance of the ganglion--_i.e., subjective_ nervous system over\nthe _objective_ or cerebral system. From which it may be concluded that\nthey are controlled not so much by objective and proper apprehension as\nby subjective ideas, which excite desire and arise through the influence\nof the ganglionic system upon the brain; accordingly they are moved by a\ncertain illusion....\n\nThe great preponderance of brain in man accounts for his having fewer\ninstincts than the lower order of animals, and for even these few easily\nbeing led astray. For instance, the sense of beauty which instinctively\nguides a man in his selection of a mate is misguided when it degenerates\ninto the proneness to pederasty. Similarly, the blue-bottle (_Musca\nvomitoria_), which instinctively ought to place its eggs in putrified\nflesh, lays them in the blossom of the _Arum dracunculus_, because it is\nmisled by the decaying odour of this plant. That an absolutely generic\ninstinct is the foundation of all love of sex may be confirmed by a\ncloser analysis of the subject--an analysis which can hardly be avoided.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "In the first place, a man in love is by nature inclined to be\ninconstant, while a woman constant. A man's love perceptibly decreases\nafter a certain period; almost every other woman charms him more than\nthe one he already possesses; he longs for change: while a woman's love\nincreases from the very moment it is returned. This is because nature\naims at the preservation of the species, and consequently at as great an\nincrease in it as possible.... This is why a man is always desiring\nother women, while a woman always clings to one man; for nature compels\nher intuitively and unconsciously to take care of the supporter and\nprotector of the future offspring. For this reason conjugal fidelity is\nartificial with the man but natural to a woman. Hence a woman's\ninfidelity, looked at objectively on account of the consequences, and\nsubjectively on account of its unnaturalness, is much more unpardonable\nthan a man's.\n\nIn order to be quite clear and perfectly convinced that the delight we\ntake in the other sex, however objective it may seem to be, is\nnevertheless merely instinct disguised, in other words, the sense of the\nspecies striving to preserve its type, it will be necessary to\ninvestigate more closely the considerations which influence us in this,\nand go into details, strange as it may seem for these details to figure\nin a philosophical work. These considerations may be classed in the\nfollowing way:--\n\nThose that immediately concern the type of the species, _id est_,\nbeauty; those that concern other physical qualities; and finally, those\nthat are merely relative and spring from the necessary correction or\nneutralisation of the one-sided qualities and abnormities of the two\nindividuals by each other. Let us look at these considerations\nseparately.\n\nThe first consideration that influences our choice and feelings is\n_age_....", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "The second consideration is that of _health_: a severe illness may alarm\nus for the time being, but an illness of a chronic nature or even\ncachexy frightens us away, because it would be transmitted.\n\nThe third consideration is the _skeleton_, since it is the foundation of\nthe type of the _species_. Next to old age and disease, nothing disgusts\nus so much as a deformed shape; even the most beautiful face cannot make\namends for it--in fact, the ugliest face combined with a well-grown\nshape is infinitely preferable. Moreover, we are most keenly sensible of\nevery malformation of the _skeleton_; as, for instance, a stunted,\nshort-legged form, and the like, or a limping gait when it is not the\nresult of some extraneous accident: while a conspicuously beautiful\nfigure compensates for every defect. It delights us. Further, the great\nimportance which is attached to small feet! This is because the size of\nthe foot is an essential characteristic of the species, for no animal\nhas the tarsus and metatarsus combined so small as man; hence the\nuprightness of his gait: he is a plantigrade. And Jesus Sirach has\nsaid[17] (according to the improved translation by Kraus), \"A woman that\nis well grown and has beautiful feet is like pillars of gold in sockets\nof silver.\" The teeth, too, are important, because they are essential\nfor nourishment, and quite peculiarly hereditary.\n\nThe fourth consideration is a certain _plumpness_, in other words, a\nsuperabundance of the vegetative function, plasticity.... Hence\nexcessive thinness strikingly repels us.... The last consideration that\ninfluences us is a _beautiful face_. Here, too, the bone parts are taken\ninto account before everything else. So that almost everything depends\non a beautiful nose, while a short _retrouss\u00e9_ one will mar all. A\nslight upward or downward turn of the nose has often determined the\nlife's happiness of a great many maidens; and justly so, for the type of\nthe species is at stake.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "A small mouth, by means of small maxillae, is very essential, as it is\nthe specific characteristic of the human face as distinguished from the\nmuzzle of the brutes. A receding, as it were, a cut-away chin is\nparticularly repellent, because _mentum prominulum_ is a characteristic\nbelonging exclusively to our species.\n\nFinally, we come to the consideration of beautiful eyes and a beautiful\nforehead; they depend upon the psychical qualities, and in particular,\nthe intellectual, which are inherited from the mother. The unconscious\nconsiderations which, on the other hand, influence women in their choice\nnaturally cannot be so accurately specified. In general, we may say the\nfollowing:--That the age they prefer is from thirty to thirty-five. For\ninstance, they prefer men of this age to youths, who in reality possess\nthe highest form of human beauty. The reason for this is that they are\nnot guided by taste but by instinct, which recognises in this particular\nage the acme of generative power. In general, women pay little attention\nto beauty, that is, to beauty of face; they seem to take it upon\nthemselves alone to endow the child with beauty. It is chiefly the\nstrength of a man and the courage that goes with it that attract them,\nfor both of these promise the generation of robust children and at the\nsame time a brave protector for them. Every physical defect in a man,\nany deviation from the type, a woman may, with regard to the child,\neradicate if she is faultless in these parts herself or excels in a\ncontrary direction. The only exceptions are those qualities which are\npeculiar to the man, and which, in consequence, a mother cannot bestow\non her child; these include the masculine build of the skeleton, breadth\nof shoulder, small hips, straight legs, strength of muscle, courage,\nbeard, and so on. And so it happens that a woman frequently loves an\nugly man, albeit she never loves an unmanly man, because she cannot\nneutralise his defects.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "The second class of considerations that are the source of love are those\ndepending on the psychical qualities. Here we shall find that a woman\nuniversally is attracted by the qualities of a man's heart or character,\nboth of which are inherited from the father. It is mainly firmness of\nwill, determination and courage, and may be honesty and goodness of\nheart too, that win a woman over; while intellectual qualifications\nexercise no direct or instinctive power over her, for the simple reason\nthat these are not inherited from the father. A lack of intelligence\ncarries no weight with her; in fact, a superabundance of mental power or\neven genius, as abnormities, might have an unfavourable effect. And so\nwe frequently find a woman preferring a stupid, ugly, and ill-mannered\nman to one who is well-educated, intellectual, and agreeable. Hence,\npeople of extremely different temperament frequently marry for\nlove--that is to say, _he_ is coarse, strong, and narrow-minded, while\n_she_ is very sensitive, refined, cultured, and aesthetic, and so on; or\n_he_ is genial and clever, and _she_ is a goose.\n\n  \"Sic visum Veneri; cui placet impares\n  Formas atque animos sub juga a\u00ebnea\n    Saevo mittere cum joco.\"", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "The reason for this is, that she is not influenced by intellectual\nconsiderations, but by something entirely different, namely, instinct.\nMarriage is not regarded as a means for intellectual entertainment, but\nfor the generation of children; it is a union of hearts and not of\nminds. When a woman says that she has fallen in love with a man's mind,\nit is either a vain and ridiculous pretence on her part or the\nexaggeration of a degenerate being. A man, on the other hand, is not\ncontrolled in instinctive love by the _qualities_ of the woman's\n_character_; this is why so many a Socrates has found his Xantippe, as\nfor instance, Shakespeare, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Byron, and others. But here\nwe have the influence of intellectual qualities, because they are\ninherited from the mother; nevertheless their influence is easily\noverpowered by physical beauty, which concerns more essential points,\nand therefore has a more direct effect. By the way, it is for this\nreason that mothers who have either felt or experienced the former\ninfluence have their daughters taught the fine arts, languages, etc., so\nthat they may prove more attractive. In this way they hope by artificial\nmeans to pad the intellect, just as they do their bust and hips if it is\nnecessary to do so. Let it be understood that here we are simply\nspeaking of that attraction which is absolutely direct and instinctive,\nand from which springs real love. That an intelligent and educated woman\nesteems intelligence and brains in a man, and that a man after\ndeliberate reasoning criticises and considers the character of his\n_fiance\u00e9_, are matters which do not concern our present subject. Such\nthings influence a rational selection in marriage, but they do not\ncontrol passionate love, which is our matter.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "Up to the present I have taken into consideration merely the _absolute_\nconsiderations--_id est_, such considerations as apply to every one. I\nnow come to the _relative_ considerations, which are individual, because\nthey aim at rectifying the type of the species which is defectively\npresented and at correcting any deviation from it existing in the person\nof the chooser himself, and in this way lead back to a pure presentation\nof the type. Hence each man loves what he himself is deficient in. The\nchoice that is based on relative considerations--that is, has in view\nthe constitution of the individual--is much more certain, decided, and\nexclusive than the choice that is made after merely absolute\nconsiderations; consequently real passionate love will have its origin,\nas a rule, in these relative considerations, and it will only be the\nordinary phases of love that spring from the absolute. So that it is not\nstereotyped, perfectly beautiful women who are wont to kindle great\npassions. Before a truly passionate feeling can exist, something is\nnecessary that is perhaps best expressed by a metaphor in\nchemistry--namely, the two persons must neutralise each other, like acid\nand alkali to a neutral salt. Before this can be done the following\nconditions are essential. In the first place, all sexuality is\none-sided. This one-sidedness is more definitely expressed and exists in\na higher degree in one person than in another; so that it may be better\nsupplemented and neutralised in each individual by one person than by\nanother of the opposite sex, because the individual requires a\none-sidedness opposite to his own in order to complete the type of\nhumanity in the new individual to be generated, to the constitution of\nwhich everything tends....", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "The following is necessary for this neutralisation of which we are\nspeaking. The particular degree of _his_ manhood must exactly correspond\nto the particular degree of _her_ womanhood in order to exactly balance\nthe one-sidedness of each. Hence the most manly man will desire the most\nwomanly woman, and _vice vers\u00e2_, and so each will want the individual\nthat exactly corresponds to him in degree of sex. Inasmuch as two\npersons fulfil this necessary relation towards each other, it is\ninstinctively felt by them and is the origin, together with the other\n_relative_ considerations, of the higher degrees of love. While,\ntherefore, two lovers are pathetically talking about the harmony of\ntheir souls, the kernel of the conversation is for the most part the\nharmony concerning the individual and its perfection, which obviously is\nof much more importance than the harmony of their souls--which\nfrequently turns out to be a violent discord shortly after marriage.\n\nWe now come to those other relative considerations which depend on each\nindividual trying to eradicate, through the medium of another, his\nweaknesses, deficiencies, and deviations from the type, in order that\nthey may not be perpetuated in the child that is to be born or develop\ninto absolute abnormities.

{"text": "Nevertheless, if a big woman choose a big husband, in order, perhaps, to\npresent a better appearance in society, the children, as a rule, suffer\nfor her folly. Again, another very decided consideration is complexion.\nBlonde people fancy either absolutely dark complexions or brown; but it\nis rarely the case _vice vers\u00e2_. The reason for it is this: that fair\nhair and blue eyes are a deviation from the type and almost constitute\nan abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at any rate white horses. They\nare not indigenous to any other part of the world but Europe,--not even\nto the polar regions,--and are obviously of Scandinavian origin. _En\npassant_, it is my conviction that a white skin is not natural to man,\nand that by nature he has either a black or brown skin like our\nforefathers, the Hindoos, and that the white man was never originally\ncreated by nature; and that, therefore, there is no _race_ of white\npeople, much as it is talked about, but every white man is a bleached\none. Driven up into the north, where he was a stranger, and where he\nexisted only like an exotic plant, in need of a hothouse in winter, man\nin the course of centuries became white. The gipsies, an Indian tribe\nwhich emigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition of\nthe Hindoo's complexion to ours. In love, therefore, nature strives to\nreturn to dark hair and brown eyes, because they are the original type;\nstill, a white skin has become second nature, although not to such an\nextent as to make the dark skin of the Hindoo repellent to us.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "Finally, every man tries to find the corrective of his own defects and\naberrations in the particular parts of his body, and the more\nconspicuous the defect is the greater is his determination to correct\nit. This is why snub-nosed persons find an aquiline nose or a\nparrot-like face so indescribably pleasing; and the same thing applies\nto every other part of the body. Men of immoderately long and attenuated\nbuild delight in a stunted and short figure. Considerations of\ntemperament also influence a man's choice. Each prefers a temperament\nthe reverse of his own; but only in so far as his is a decided one.\n\nA man who is quite perfect in some respect himself does not, it is true,\ndesire and love imperfection in this particular respect, yet he can be\nmore easily reconciled to it than another man, because he himself saves\nthe children from being very imperfect in this particular. For instance,\na man who has a very white skin himself will not dislike a yellowish\ncomplexion, while a man who has a yellowish complexion will consider a\ndazzlingly white skin divinely beautiful. It is rare for a man to fall\nin love with a positively ugly woman, but when he does, it is because\nexact harmony in the degree of sex exists between them, and all her\nabnormities are precisely the opposite to, that is to say, the\ncorrective of his.

{"text": "The profoundly earnest way in which we criticise and narrowly consider\nevery part of a woman, while she on her part considers us; the\nscrupulously careful way we scrutinise, a woman who is beginning to\nplease us; the fickleness of our choice; the strained attention with\nwhich a man watches his _fianc\u00e9e_; the care he takes not to be deceived\nin any trait; and the great importance he attaches to every more or less\nessential trait,--all this is quite in keeping with the importance of\nthe end. For the child that is to be born will have to bear a similar\ntrait through its whole life; for instance, if a woman stoops but a\nlittle, it is possible for her son to be inflicted with a hunchback; and\nso in every other respect. We are not conscious of all this, naturally.\nOn the contrary, each man imagines that his choice is made in the\ninterest of his own pleasure (which, in reality, cannot be interested in\nit at all); his choice, which we must take for granted is in keeping\nwith his own individuality, is made precisely in the interest of the\nspecies, to maintain the type of which as pure as possible is the secret\ntask. In this case the individual unconsciously acts in the interest of\nsomething higher, that is, the species. This is why he attaches so much\nimportance to things to which he might, nay, would be otherwise\nindifferent. There is something quite singular in the unconsciously\nserious and critical way two young people of different sex look at each\nother on meeting for the first time; in the scrutinising and penetrating\nglances they exchange, in the careful inspection which their various\ntraits undergo. This scrutiny and analysis represent the _meditation of\nthe genius of the species_ on the individual which may be born and the\ncombination of its qualities; and the greatness of their delight in and\nlonging for each other is determined by this meditation. This longing,\nalthough it may have become intense, may possibly disappear again if\nsomething previously unobserved comes to light. And so the genius of the\nspecies meditates concerning the coming race in all who are yet not too\nold. It is Cupid's work to fashion this race, and he is always busy,\nalways speculating, always meditating. The affairs of the individual in\ntheir whole ephemeral totality are very trivial compared with those of\nthis divinity, which concern the species and the coming race; therefore\nhe is always ready to sacrifice the individual regardlessly. He is\nrelated to these ephemeral affairs as an immortal being is to a mortal,\nand his interests to theirs as infinite to finite. Conscious, therefore,\nof administering affairs of a higher order than those that concern\nmerely the weal and woe of the individual, he administers them with\nsublime indifference amid the tumult of war, the bustle of business, or\nthe raging of a plague--indeed, he pursues them into the seclusion of\nthe cloisters.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "It has been seen that the intensity of love grows with its\nindividuation; we have shown that two individuals may be so physically\nconstituted, that, in order to restore the best possible type of the\nspecies, the one is the special and perfect complement of the other,\nwhich, in consequence, exclusively desires it. In a case of this kind,\npassionate love arises, and as it is bestowed on one object, and one\nonly--that is to say, because it appears in the _special_ service of the\nspecies--it immediately assumes a nobler and sublimer nature. On the\nother hand, mere sexual instinct is base, because, without\nindividuation, it is directed to all, and strives to preserve the\nspecies merely as regards quantity with little regard for quality.\nIntense love concentrated on one individual may develop to such a\ndegree, that unless it is gratified all the good things of this world,\nand even life itself, lose their importance. It then becomes a desire,\nthe intensity of which is like none other; consequently it will make any\nkind of sacrifice, and should it happen that it cannot be gratified, it\nmay lead to madness or even suicide. Besides these unconscious\nconsiderations which are the source of passionate love, there must be\nstill others, which we have not so directly before us. Therefore, we\nmust take it for granted that here there is not only a fitness of\nconstitution but also a special fitness between the man's _will_ and the\nwoman's _intellect_, in consequence of which a perfectly definite\nindividual can be born to them alone, whose existence is contemplated by\nthe genius of the species for reasons to us impenetrable, since they are\nthe very essence of the thing-in-itself. Or more strictly speaking, the\nwill to live desires to objectivise itself in an individual which is\nprecisely determined, and can only be begotten by this particular father\nand this particular mother. This metaphysical yearning of the will in\nitself has immediately, as its sphere of action in the circle of human\nbeings, the hearts of the future parents, who accordingly are seized\nwith this desire. They now fancy that it is for their own sakes they are\nlonging for what at present has purely a metaphysical end, that is to\nsay, for what does not come within the range of things that exist in\nreality. In other words, it is the desire of the future individual to\nenter existence, which has first become possible here, a longing which\nproceeds from the primary source of all being and exhibits itself in the\nphenomenal world as the intense love of the future parents for each\nother, and has little regard for anything outside itself. In fact, love\nis an illusion like no other; it will induce a man to sacrifice\neverything he possesses in the world, in order to obtain this woman, who\nin reality will satisfy him no more than any other. It also ceases to\nexist when the end, which was in reality metaphysical, has been\nfrustrated perhaps by the woman's barrenness (which, according to\nHufeland, is the result of nineteen accidental defects in the\nconstitution), just as it is frustrated daily in millions of crushed\ngerms in which the same metaphysical life-principle struggles to exist;\nthere is no other consolation in this than that there is an infinity of\nspace, time, and matter, and consequently inexhaustible opportunity, at\nthe service of the will to live.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

{"text": "Curiously enough, there is a passage touching upon this in _Guzmann de\nAlfarache_, a well-known romance written two hundred and fifty years ago\nby Mateo Aleman: _No es necessario para que uno ame, que pase distancia\nde tiempo, que siga discurso, in haga eleccion, sino que con aquella\nprimera y sola vista, concurran juntamente cierta correspondencia \u00f3\nconsonancia, \u00f3 lo que ac\u00e1 solemos vulgarmente decir, una confrontacion\nde sangre, \u00e0 que por particular influxo suelen mover las estrellas_.\n(For a man to love there is no need for any length of time to pass for\nhim to weigh considerations or make his choice, but only that a certain\ncorrespondence and consonance is encountered on both sides at the first\nand only glance, or that which is ordinarily called _a sympathy of\nblood_, to which a peculiar influence of the stars generally impels.)\nAccordingly, the loss of the beloved one through a rival, or through\ndeath, is the greatest pain of all to those passionately in love; just\nbecause it is of a transcendental nature, since it affects him not\nmerely as an individual, but also assails him in his _essentia aeterna_,\nin the life of the species, in whose special will and service he was\nhere called. This is why jealousy is so tormenting and bitter, and the\ngiving up of the loved one the greatest of all sacrifices. A hero is\nashamed of showing any kind of emotion but that which may be the outcome\nof love; the reason for this is, that when he is in love it is not he,\nbut the species which is grieving. In Calderon's _Zenobia the Great_\nthere is a scene in the second act between Zenobia and Decius where the\nlatter says, _Cielos, luego tu me quieres? Perdiera cien mil victorias,\nVolvi\u00e9rame_, etc. (Heavens! then you love me? For this I would\nsacrifice a thousand victories, etc.) In this case honour, which has\nhitherto outweighed every other interest, is driven out of the field\ndirectly love--_i.e._, the interest of the species--comes into play and\ndiscerns something that will be of decided advantage to itself; for the\ninterest of the species, compared with that of the mere individual,\nhowever important this may be, is infinitely more important. Honour,\nduty, and fidelity succumb to it after they have withstood every other\ntemptation--the menace of death even. We find the same going on in\nprivate life; for instance, a man has less conscience when in love than\nin any other circumstances. Conscience is sometimes put on one side even\nby people who are otherwise honest and straightforward, and infidelity\nrecklessly committed if they are passionately in love--i.e., when the\ninterest of the species has taken possession of them. It would seem,\nindeed, as if they believed themselves conscious of a greater authority\nthan the interests of individuals could ever confer; this is simply\nbecause they are concerned in the interest of the species. Chamfort's\nutterance in this respect is remarkable: _Quand un homme et une femme\nont l'un pour l'autre une passion violente, il me semble toujours que\nquelque soient les obstacles qui les s\u00e9parent, un mari, des parens,\netc.; les deux amans sont l'un \u00e0 l'autre, de par la Nature, qu'ils\ns'appartiennent de droit devin, malgr\u00e9 les lois et les conventions\nhumaines_.... From this standpoint the greater part of the _Decameron_\nseems a mere mocking and jeering on the part of the genius of the\nspecies at the rights and interests of the individual which it treads\nunderfoot. Inequality of rank and all similar relations are put on one\nside with the same indifference and disregarded by the genius of the\nspecies, if they thwart the union of two people passionately in love\nwith one another: it pursues its ends pertaining to endless generations,\nscattering human principles and scruples abroad like chaff.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

For the struggling of a pair of lovers seems\nto us so much more important, delightful, and consequently justifiable\nthan any other, as the species is more important than the individual.\n\nAccordingly, we have as the fundamental subject of almost all comedies\nthe genius of the species with its purposes, running counter to the\npersonal interests of the individuals presented, and, in consequence,\nthreatening to undermine their happiness.

Hence he is quite consoled when\nhe finally takes leave of the victorious lovers, sharing with them the\nillusion that they have established their own happiness, while, in\ntruth, they have sacrificed it for the welfare of the species, in\nopposition to the will of the discreet old people.\n\nIt has been attempted in a few out-of-the-way comedies to reverse this\nstate of things and to effect the happiness of the individuals at the\ncost of the ends of the species; but here the spectator is sensible of\nthe pain inflicted on the genius of the species, and does not find\nconsolation in the advantages that are assured to the individuals.\n\nTwo very well-known little pieces occur to me as examples of this kind:\n_La reine de 16 ans_, and _Le mariage de raison_.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

It is\nfundamentally this that in the higher phases of love gives such a\npoetical and sublime colour, nay, transcendental and hyperphysical turn\nto a man's thoughts, whereby he appears to lose sight of his essentially\nmaterial purpose. He is inspired by the spirit of the species, whose\naffairs are infinitely more important than any which concern mere\nindividuals, in order to establish by special mandate of this spirit the\nexistence of an indefinitely long posterity with _this_ particular and\nprecisely determined nature, which it can receive only from him as\nfather and his loved one as mother, and which, moreover, _as such_ never\ncomes into existence, while the objectivation of the will to live\nexpressly demands this existence. It is the feeling that he is engaged\nin affairs of such transcendent importance that exalts the lover above\neverything earthly, nay, indeed, above himself, and gives such a\nhyperphysical clothing to his physical wishes, that love becomes, even\nin the life of the most prosaic, a poetical episode; and then the affair\noften assumes a comical aspect. That mandate of the will which\nobjectifies itself in the species presents itself in the consciousness\nof the lover under the mask of the anticipation of an infinite\nhappiness, which is to be found in his union with this particular woman.\nThis illusion to a man deeply in love becomes so dazzling that if it\ncannot be attained, life itself not only loses all charm, but appears to\nbe so joyless, hollow, and uninteresting as to make him too disgusted\nwith it to be afraid of the terrors of death; this is why he sometimes\nof his own free will cuts his life short. The will of a man of this kind\nhas become engulfed in that of the species, or the will of the species\nhas obtained so great an ascendency over the will of the individual that\nif such a man cannot be effective in the manifestation of the first, he\ndisdains to be so in the last. The individual in this case is too weak a\nvessel to bear the infinite longing of the will of the species\nconcentrated upon a definite object. When this is the case suicide is\nthe result, and sometimes suicide of the two lovers; unless nature, to\nprevent this, causes insanity, which then enshrouds with its veil the\nconsciousness of so hopeless a condition.

{"text": "However, it is not only unrequited love that leads frequently to a\ntragic end; for requited love more frequently leads to unhappiness than\nto happiness. This is because its demands often so severely clash with\nthe personal welfare of the lover concerned as to undermine it, since\nthe demands are incompatible with the lover's other circumstances, and\nin consequence destroy the plans of life built upon them. Further, love\nfrequently runs counter not only to external circumstances but to the\nindividuality itself, for it may fling itself upon a person who, apart\nfrom the relation of sex, may become hateful, despicable, nay, even\nrepulsive. As the will of the species, however, is so very much stronger\nthan that of the individual, the lover shuts his eyes to all\nobjectionable qualities, overlooks everything, ignores all, and unites\nhimself for ever to the object of his passion. He is so completely\nblinded by this illusion that as soon as the will of the species is\naccomplished the illusion vanishes and leaves in its place a hateful\ncompanion for life. From this it is obvious why we often see very\nintelligent, nay, distinguished men married to dragons and she-devils,\nand why we cannot understand how it was possible for them to make such a\nchoice. Accordingly, the ancients represented _Amor_ as blind. In fact,\nit is possible for a lover to clearly recognise and be bitterly\nconscious of horrid defects in his _fianc\u00e9e's_ disposition and\ncharacter--defects which promise him a life of misery--and yet for him\nnot to be filled with fear:\n\n  \"I ask not, I care not,\n    If guilt's in thy heart;\n  I know that I love thee,\n    Whatever thou art.\"", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

Finally, a man may both love and hate his beloved\nat the same time. Accordingly, Plato compares a man's love to the love\nof a wolf for a sheep.

Shakespeare furnishes us with such an\nexample in _Henry VI_ Part III., Act iii., Scenes 2 and 3. This is\nbecause the species, in which lies the germ of our being, has a nearer\nand prior claim upon us than the individual, so that the affairs of the\nspecies are more important than those of the individual. Sensible of\nthis, the ancients personified the genius of the species in Cupid,\nnotwithstanding his having the form of a child, as a hostile and cruel\ngod, and therefore one to be decried as a capricious and despotic demon,\nand yet lord of both gods and men.\n\n  \u03a3\u03c5 \u03b4' \u1f60 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03b5 \u03ba' \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f18\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2.\n  (Tu, deorum hominumque tyranne, Amor!)\n\nMurderous darts, blindness, and wings are Cupid's attributes.

People who marry for love do so in the interest of the species\nand not of the individuals. It is true that the persons concerned\nimagine they are promoting their own happiness; but their real aim,\nwhich is one they are unconscious of, is to bring forth an individual\nwhich can be begotten by them alone. This purpose having brought them\ntogether, they ought henceforth to try and make the best of things. But\nit very frequently happens that two people who have been brought\ntogether by this instinctive illusion, which is the essence of\npassionate love, are in every other respect temperamentally different.\nThis becomes apparent when the illusion wears off, as it necessarily\nmust.\n\nAccordingly, people who marry for love are generally unhappy, for such\npeople look after the welfare of the future generation at the expense of\nthe present. _Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con dolores_ (He who\nmarries for love must live in grief), says the Spanish proverb.\nMarriages _de convenance_, which are generally arranged by the parents,\nwill turn out the reverse. The considerations in this case which control\nthem, whatever their nature may be, are at any rate real and unable to\nvanish of themselves.

For\nthis interest of so active and zealous a nature, which is neither the\nresult of reflection nor intention, springs from the innermost\ncharacteristics and tendencies of our being, could not exist so\ncontinuously or exercise such great power over man if the latter were\nreally transitory and if a race really and totally different to himself\nsucceeded him merely in point of time.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

This is why it has been\npre-eminently called the \"affair of the heart.\" Everything that merely\nconcerns one's own person is set aside and sacrificed, if the case\nrequire it, to this interest when it is of a strong and decided nature.\nTherefore in this way man proves that he is more interested in the\nspecies than in the individual, and that he lives more directly in the\ninterest of the species than in that of the individual.\n\nWhy, then, is a lover so absolutely devoted to every look and turn of\nhis beloved, and ready to make any kind of sacrifice for her? Because\nthe _immortal_ part of him is yearning for her; it is only the _mortal_\npart of him that longs for everything else.

Still, it is not the face that deceives, whatever Figaro may\nsay, but it is we who are deceived in reading what is not there. The\ndeciphering of the face is certainly a great and difficult art. Its\nprinciples can never be learnt _in abstracto_. Its first condition is\nthat the man must be looked at from a _purely objective_ point of view;\nwhich is not so easy to do. As soon as, for instance, there is the\nslightest sign of dislike, or affection, or fear, or hope, or even the\nthought of the impression which we ourselves are making on him--in\nshort, as soon as anything of a subjective nature is present, the\nhieroglyphics become confused and falsified.

But, on the other hand,\nwhat has just been said about the shock one receives at first sight\ncoincides with the above remark, that it is only at first sight that a\nface makes its true and full impression. In order to get a purely\nobjective and true impression of it, we must stand in no kind of\nrelation to the person, nay, if possible, we must not even have spoken\nto him. Conversation makes one in some measure friendly disposed, and\nbrings us into a certain _rapport_, a reciprocal _subjective_ relation,\nwhich immediately interferes with our taking an objective view. As\neverybody strives to win either respect or friendship for himself, a man\nwho is being observed will immediately resort to every art of\ndissembling, and corrupt us with his airs, hypocrisies, and flatteries;\nso that in a short time we no longer see what the first impression had\nclearly shown us. It is said that \"most people gain on further\nacquaintance\" but what ought to be said is that \"they delude us\" on\nfurther acquaintance. But when these bad traits have an opportunity of\nshowing themselves later on, our first impression generally receives its\njustification. Sometimes a further acquaintance is a hostile one, in\nwhich case it will not be found that people gain by it. Another reason\nfor the apparent advantage of a further acquaintance is, that the man\nwhose first appearance repels us, as soon as we converse with him no\nlonger shows his true being and character, but his education as\nwell--that is to say, not only what he really is by nature, but what he\nhas appropriated from the common wealth of mankind; three-fourths of\nwhat he says does not belong to him, but has been acquired from without;\nso that we are often surprised to hear such a minotaur speak so humanly.\nAnd on a still further acquaintance, the brutality of which his face\ngave promise, will reveal itself in all its glory. Therefore a man who\nis gifted with a keen sense of physiognomy should pay careful attention\nto those verdicts prior to a further acquaintance, and therefore\ngenuine. For the face of a man expresses exactly what he is, and if he\ndeceives us it is not his fault but ours. On the other hand, the words\nof a man merely state what he thinks, more frequently only what he has\nlearnt, or it may be merely what he pretends to think. Moreover, when we\nspeak to him, nay, only hear others speak to him, our attention is taken\naway from his real physiognomy; because it is the substance, that which\nis given fundamentally, and we disregard it; and we only pay attention\nto its pathognomy, its play of feature while speaking.

Any kind of\nsociety and conversation with another throw a reflection upon him which\nis not his own, mostly to his advantage; for he thereby is placed in a\ncondition of action and reaction which exalts him. But, on the contrary,\nif he is alone and left to himself immersed in the depths of his own\nthoughts and sensations, it is only then that he is absolutely and\nwholly _himself_. And any one with a keen, penetrating eye for\nphysiognomy can grasp the general character of his whole being at a\nglance. For on his face, regarded in and by itself, is indicated the\nground tone of all his thoughts and efforts, the _arr\u00eat irrevocable_ of\nhis future, and of which he is only conscious when alone.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "The science of physiognomy is one of the principal means of a knowledge\nof mankind: arts of dissimulation do not come within the range of\nphysiognomy, but within that of mere pathognomy and mimicry. This is\nprecisely why I recommend the physiognomy of a man to be studied when he\nis alone and left to his own thoughts, and before he has been conversed\nwith; partly because it is only then that his physiognomy can be seen\npurely and simply, since in conversation pathognomy immediately steps\nin, and he then resorts to the arts of dissimulation which he has\nacquired; and partly because personal intercourse, even of the slightest\nnature, makes us prejudiced, and in consequence impairs our judgment.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}
{"text": "Concerning our physiognomy in general, it is still to be observed that\nit is much easier to discover the intellectual capacities of a man than\nhis moral character. The intellectual capacities take a much more\noutward direction. They are expressed not only in the face and play of\nhis features, but also in his walk, nay, in every movement, however\nslight it may be. One could perhaps discriminate from behind between a\nblockhead, a fool, and a man of genius. A clumsy awkwardness\ncharacterises every movement of the blockhead; folly imprints its mark\non every gesture, and so do genius and a reflective nature. Hence the\noutcome of La Bruyere's remark: _Il n'y a rien de si d\u00e9li\u00e9, de si\nsimple, et de si imperceptible o\u00f9 il n'y entrent des mani\u00e8res, qui nous\nd\u00e9c\u00e8lent: un sot ni n'entre, ni ne sort, ni ne s'assied, ni ne se l\u00e8ve,\nni ne se tait, ni n'est sur ses jambes, comme un homme d'esprit_. This\naccounts for, by the way, that instinct _stir et prompt_ which,\naccording to Helvetius, ordinary people have of recognising people of\ngenius and of running away from them. This is to be accounted for by the\nfact that the larger and more developed the brain, and the thinner, in\nrelation to it, the spine and nerves, the greater not only is the\nintelligence, but also at the same time the mobility and pliancy of all\nthe limbs; because they are controlled more immediately and decisively\nby the brain; consequently everything depends more on a single thread,\nevery movement of which precisely expresses its purpose. The whole\nmatter is analogous to, nay dependent on, the fact that the higher an\nanimal stands in the scale of development, the easier can it be killed\nby wounding it in a single place. Take, for instance, batrachia: they\nare as heavy, clumsy, and slow in their movements as they are\nunintelligent, and at the same time extremely tenacious of life. This is\nexplained by the fact that with a little brain they have a very thick\nspine and nerves. But gait and movement of the arms are for the most\npart functions of the brain; because the limbs receive their motion, and\neven the slightest modification of it, from the brain through the medium\nof the spinal nerves; and this is precisely why voluntary movements tire\nus. This feeling of fatigue, like that of pain, has its seat in the\nbrain, and not as we suppose in the limbs, hence motion promotes sleep;\non the other hand, those motions that are not excited by the brain, that\nis to say, the involuntary motions of organic life, of the heart and\nlungs, go on without causing fatigue: and as thought as well as motion\nis a function of the brain, the character of its activity is denoted in\nboth, according to the nature of the individual. Stupid people move like\nlay figures, while every joint of intellectual people speaks for itself.\nIntellectual qualities are much better discerned, however, in the face\nthan in gestures and movements, in the shape and size of the forehead,\nin the contraction and movement of the features, and especially in the\neye; from the little, dull, sleepy-looking eye of the pig, through all\ngradations, to the brilliant sparkling eye of the genius. The _look of\nwisdom_, even of the best kind, is different from that of _genius_,\nsince it bears the stamp of serving the will; while that of the latter\nis free from it. Therefore the anecdote which Squarzafichi relates in\nhis life of Petrarch, and has taken from Joseph Brivius, a contemporary,\nis quite credible--namely, that when Petrarch was at the court of\nVisconti, and among many men and titled people, Galeazzo Visconti asked\nhis son, who was still a boy in years and was afterwards the first Duke\nof Milan, to pick out _the wisest man_ of those present. The boy looked\nat every one for a while, when he seized Petrarch's hand and led him to\nhis father, to the great admiration of all present. For nature imprints\nher stamp of dignity so distinctly on the distinguished among mankind\nthat a child can perceive it. Therefore I should advise my sagacious\ncountrymen, if they ever again wish to trumpet a commonplace person as a\ngenius for the period of thirty years, not to choose for that end such\nan inn-keeper's physiognomy as was possessed by Hegel, upon whose face\nnature had written in her clearest handwriting the familiar title,\n_commonplace person_. But what applies to intellectual qualities does\nnot apply to the moral character of mankind; its physiognomy is much\nmore difficult to perceive, because, being of a metaphysical nature, it\nlies much deeper, and although moral character is connected with the\nconstitution and with the organism, it is not so immediately connected,\nhowever, with definite parts of its system as is intellect. Hence, while\neach one makes a public show of his intelligence, with which he is in\ngeneral quite satisfied, and tries to display it at every opportunity,\nthe moral qualities are seldom brought to light, nay, most people\nintentionally conceal them; and long practice makes them acquire great\nmastery in hiding them.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

This is the more\nstriking as there is no forbiddance of it, or even positive disapproval\nof it, to be found either in the New Testament or the Old; so that\nteachers of religion have to base their disapprobation of suicide on\ntheir own philosophical grounds; these, however, are so bad that they\ntry to compensate for the weakness of their arguments by strongly\nexpressing their abhorrence of the act--that is to say, by abusing it.\nWe are told that suicide is an act of the greatest cowardice, that it is\nonly possible to a madman, and other absurdities of a similar nature; or\nthey make use of the perfectly senseless expression that it is\n\"_wrong_,\" while it is perfectly clear that no one has such indisputable\nright over anything in the world as over his own person and life.\nSuicide, as has been said, is computed a crime, rendering\ninevitable--especially in vulgar, bigoted England--an ignominious\nburial and the confiscation of the property; this is why the jury almost\nalways bring in the verdict of insanity. Let one's own moral feelings\ndecide the matter for one. Compare the impression made upon one by the\nnews that a friend has committed a crime, say a murder, an act of\ncruelty or deception, or theft, with the news that he has died a\nvoluntary death. Whilst news of the first kind will incite intense\nindignation, the greatest displeasure, and a desire for punishment or\nrevenge, news of the second will move us to sorrow and compassion;\nmoreover, we will frequently have a feeling of admiration for his\ncourage rather than one of moral disapproval, which accompanies a wicked\nact. Who has not had acquaintances, friends, relatives, who have\nvoluntarily left this world? And are we to think of them with horror as\ncriminals? _Nego ac pernego_! I am rather of the opinion that the clergy\nshould be challenged to state their authority for stamping--from the\npulpit or in their writings--as a _crime_ an act which has been\ncommitted by many people honoured and loved by us, and refusing an\nhonourable burial to those who have of their own free will left the\nworld. They cannot produce any kind of Biblical authority, nay, they\nhave no philosophical arguments that are at all valid; and it is\n_reasons_ that we want; mere empty phrases or words of abuse we cannot\naccept. If the criminal law forbids suicide, that is not a reason that\nholds good in the church; moreover, it is extremely ridiculous, for what\npunishment can frighten those who seek death? When a man is punished for\ntrying to commit suicide, it is his clumsy failure that is punished.", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

Further, it is well\nknown that the Hindoos often look upon suicide as a religious act, as,\nfor instance, the self-sacrifice of widows, throwing oneself under the\nwheels of the chariot of the god at Juggernaut, or giving oneself to the\ncrocodiles in the Ganges or casting oneself in the holy tanks in the\ntemples, and so on. It is the same on the stage--that mirror of life.\nFor instance, in the famous Chinese play, _L'Orphelin de la Chine_,[19]\nalmost all the noble characters end by suicide, without indicating\nanywhere or it striking the spectator that they were committing a crime.\nAt bottom it is the same on our own stage; for instance, Palmira in\n_Mahomet_, Mortimer in _Maria Stuart_, Othello, Countess Terzky. Is\nHamlet's monologue the meditation of a criminal? He merely states that\nconsidering the nature of the world, death would be certainly\npreferable, if we were sure that by it we should be annihilated. But\n_there lies the rub_! But the reasons brought to bear against suicide by\nthe priests of monotheistic, that is of Jewish religions, and by those\nphilosophers who adapt themselves to it, are weak sophisms easily\ncontradicted.[20] Hume has furnished the most thorough refutation of\nthem in his _Essay on Suicide_, which did not appear until after his\ndeath, and was immediately suppressed by the shameful bigotry and gross\necclesiastical tyranny existing in England. Hence, only a very few\ncopies of it were sold secretly, and those at a dear price; and for this\nand another treatise of that great man we are indebted to a reprint\npublished at Basle. That a purely philosophical treatise originating\nfrom one of the greatest thinkers and writers of England, which refuted\nwith cold reason the current arguments against suicide, must steal about\nin that country as if it were a fraudulent piece of work until it found\nprotection in a foreign country, is a great disgrace to the English\nnation. At the same time it shows what a good conscience the Church has\non a question of this kind. The only valid moral reason against suicide\nhas been explained in my chief work. It is this: that suicide prevents\nthe attainment of the highest moral aim, since it substitutes a real\nrelease from this world of misery for one that is merely apparent. But\nthere is a very great difference between a mistake and a crime, and it\nis as a crime that the Christian clergy wish to stamp it. Christianity's\ninmost truth is that suffering (the Cross) is the real purpose of life;\nhence it condemns suicide as thwarting this end, while the ancients,\nfrom a lower point of view, approved of it, nay, honoured it. This\nargument against suicide is nevertheless ascetic, and only holds good\nfrom a much higher ethical standpoint than has ever been taken by moral\nphilosophers in Europe. But if we come down from that very high\nstandpoint, there is no longer a valid moral reason for condemning\nsuicide. The extraordinarily active zeal with which the clergy of\nmonotheistic religions attack suicide is not supported either by the\nBible or by any valid reasons; so it looks as if their zeal must be\ninstigated by some secret motive. May it not be that the voluntary\nsacrificing of one's life is a poor compliment to him who said, \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd?[21]", "source": "essays_of_schopenhauer.txt"}

The resistance\nof the terrors of death is, however, considerable; they stand like a\nsentinel at the gate that leads out of life.

{"text": "INTRODUCTION.\n\nIn these pages I shall speak of _The Wisdom of Life_ in the common\nmeaning of the term, as the art, namely, of ordering our lives so as\nto obtain the greatest possible amount of pleasure and success; an art\nthe theory of which may be called _Eudaemonology_, for it teaches us\nhow to lead a happy existence. Such an existence might perhaps be\ndefined as one which, looked at from a purely objective point of\nview, or, rather, after cool and mature reflection--for the question\nnecessarily involves subjective considerations,--would be decidedly\npreferable to non-existence; implying that we should cling to it for\nits own sake, and not merely from the fear of death; and further, that\nwe should never like it to come to an end.\n\nNow whether human life corresponds, or could possibly correspond,\nto this conception of existence, is a question to which, as is\nwell-known, my philosophical system returns a negative answer. On the\neudaemonistic hypothesis, however, the question must be answered in\nthe affirmative; and I have shown, in the second volume of my chief\nwork (ch. 49), that this hypothesis is based upon a fundamental\nmistake. Accordingly, in elaborating the scheme of a happy existence,\nI have had to make a complete surrender of the higher metaphysical and\nethical standpoint to which my own theories lead; and everything I\nshall say here will to some extent rest upon a compromise; in so far,\nthat is, as I take the common standpoint of every day, and embrace\nthe error which is at the bottom of it. My remarks, therefore, will\npossess only a qualified value, for the very word _eudaemonology_ is a\neuphemism. Further, I make no claims to completeness; partly because\nthe subject is inexhaustible, and partly because I should otherwise\nhave to say over again what has been already said by others.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

Aristotle, it is true, has a\nfew words on eudaemonology in the fifth chapter of the first book\nof his _Rhetoric_; but what he says does not come to very much.\nAs compilation is not my business, I have made no use of these\npredecessors; more especially because in the process of compiling,\nindividuality of view is lost, and individuality of view is the kernel\nof works of this kind. In general, indeed, the wise in all ages have\nalways said the same thing, and the fools, who at all times form the\nimmense majority, have in their way too acted alike, and done just the\nopposite; and so it will continue.

{"text": "The differences which come under the first head are those which Nature\nherself has set between man and man; and from this fact alone we may\nat once infer that they influence the happiness or unhappiness of\nmankind in a much more vital and radical way than those contained\nunder the two following heads, which are merely the effect of human\narrangements. Compared with _genuine personal advantages_, such as a\ngreat mind or a great heart, all the privileges of rank or birth, even\nof royal birth, are but as kings on the stage, to kings in real life.\nThe same thing was said long ago by Metrodorus, the earliest disciple\nof Epicurus, who wrote as the title of one of his chapters, _The\nhappiness we receive from ourselves is greater than that which we\nobtain from our surroundings_[1] And it is an obvious fact, which\ncannot be called in question, that the principal element in a man's\nwell-being,--indeed, in the whole tenor of his existence,--is what he\nis made of, his inner constitution. For this is the immediate source\nof that inward satisfaction or dissatisfaction resulting from the\nsum total of his sensations, desires and thoughts; whilst his\nsurroundings, on the other hand, exert only a mediate or indirect\ninfluence upon him. This is why the same external events or\ncircumstances affect no two people alike; even with perfectly similar\nsurroundings every one lives in a world of his own. For a man has\nimmediate apprehension only of his own ideas, feelings and volitions;\nthe outer world can influence him only in so far as it brings these to\nlife. The world in which a man lives shapes itself chiefly by the way\nin which he looks at it, and so it proves different to different\nmen; to one it is barren, dull, and superficial; to another rich,\ninteresting, and full of meaning. On hearing of the interesting events\nwhich have happened in the course of a man's experience, many people\nwill wish that similar things had happened in their lives too,\ncompletely forgetting that they should be envious rather of the mental\naptitude which lent those events the significance they possess when he\ndescribes them; to a man of genius they were interesting adventures;\nbut to the dull perceptions of an ordinary individual they would have\nbeen stale, everyday occurrences. This is in the highest degree the\ncase with many of Goethe's and Byron's poems, which are obviously\nfounded upon actual facts; where it is open to a foolish reader to\nenvy the poet because so many delightful things happened to him,\ninstead of envying that mighty power of phantasy which was capable\nof turning a fairly common experience into something so great and\nbeautiful.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

When therefore the objective or external factor in an\nexperience is actually the same, but the subjective or personal\nappreciation of it varies, the event is just as much a different one\nin the eyes of different persons as if the objective factors had not\nbeen alike; for to a blunt intelligence the fairest and best object in\nthe world presents only a poor reality, and is therefore only poorly\nappreciated,--like a fine landscape in dull weather, or in the\nreflection of a bad _camera obscura_. In plain language, every man\nis pent up within the limits of his own consciousness, and cannot\ndirectly get beyond those limits any more than he can get beyond his\nown skin; so external aid is not of much use to him. On the stage, one\nman is a prince, another a minister, a third a servant or a soldier or\na general, and so on,--mere external differences: the inner reality,\nthe kernel of all these appearances is the same--a poor player, with\nall the anxieties of his lot. In life it is just the same. Differences\nof rank and wealth give every man his part to play, but this by no\nmeans implies a difference of inward happiness and pleasure; here,\ntoo, there is the same being in all--a poor mortal, with his hardships\nand troubles. Though these may, indeed, in every case proceed from\ndissimilar causes, they are in their essential nature much the same in\nall their forms, with degrees of intensity which vary, no doubt, but\nin no wise correspond to the part a man has to play, to the presence\nor absence of position and wealth. Since everything which exists or\nhappens for a man exists only in his consciousness and happens for it\nalone, the most essential thing for a man is the constitution of this\nconsciousness, which is in most cases far more important than the\ncircumstances which go to form its contents. All the pride and\npleasure of the world, mirrored in the dull consciousness of a fool,\nare poor indeed compared with the imagination of Cervantes writing his\n_Don Quixote_ in a miserable prison. The objective half of life and\nreality is in the hand of fate, and accordingly takes various forms in\ndifferent cases: the subjective half is ourself, and in essentials is\nalways remains the same.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "Hence the life of every man is stamped with the same character\nthroughout, however much his external circumstances may alter; it is\nlike a series of variations on a single theme. No one can get beyond\nhis own individuality. An animal, under whatever circumstances it\nis placed, remains within the narrow limits to which nature has\nirrevocably consigned it; so that our endeavors to make a pet happy\nmust always keep within the compass of its nature, and be restricted\nto what it can feel. So it is with man; the measure of the happiness\nhe can attain is determined beforehand by his individuality. More\nespecially is this the case with the mental powers, which fix once for\nall his capacity for the higher kinds of pleasure. If these powers are\nsmall, no efforts from without, nothing that his fellowmen or that\nfortune can do for him, will suffice to raise him above the ordinary\ndegree of human happiness and pleasure, half animal though it be; his\nonly resources are his sensual appetite,--a cozy and cheerful family\nlife at the most,--low company and vulgar pastime; even education, on\nthe whole, can avail little, if anything, for the enlargement of his\nhorizon. For the highest, most varied and lasting pleasures are those\nof the mind, however much our youth may deceive us on this point; and\nthe pleasures of the mind turn chiefly on the powers of the mind. It\nis clear, then, that our happiness depends in a great degree upon what\nwe _are_, upon our individuality, whilst lot or destiny is generally\ntaken to mean only what we _have_, or our _reputation_. Our lot,\nin this sense, may improve; but we do not ask much of it if we are\ninwardly rich: on the other hand, a fool remains a fool, a dull\nblockhead, to his last hour, even though he were surrounded by houris\nin paradise. This is why Goethe, in the _West-\u00f6stliclien Divan_, says\nthat every man, whether he occupies a low position in life, or emerges\nas its victor, testifies to personality as the greatest factor in\nhappiness:--", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

Health outweighs all other blessings so much that one may\nreally say that a healthy beggar is happier than an ailing king. A\nquiet and cheerful temperament, happy in the enjoyment of a perfectly\nsound physique, an intellect clear, lively, penetrating and seeing\nthings as they are, a moderate and gentle will, and therefore a good\nconscience--these are privileges which no rank or wealth can make up\nfor or replace. For what a man is in himself, what accompanies him\nwhen he is alone, what no one can give or take away, is obviously more\nessential to him than everything he has in the way of possessions, or\neven what he may be in the eyes of the world. An intellectual man in\ncomplete solitude has excellent entertainment in his own thoughts and\nfancies, while no amount of diversity or social pleasure, theatres,\nexcursions and amusements, can ward off boredom from a dullard. A\ngood, temperate, gentle character can be happy in needy circumstances,\nwhilst a covetous, envious and malicious man, even if he be the\nrichest in the world, goes miserable. Nay more; to one who has the\nconstant delight of a special individuality, with a high degree of\nintellect, most of the pleasures which are run after by mankind are\nsimply superfluous; they are even a trouble and a burden.

Wealth, in the strict sense of the\nword, that is, great superfluity, can do little for our happiness; and\nmany rich people feel unhappy just because they are without any true\nmental culture or knowledge, and consequently have no objective\ninterests which would qualify them for intellectual occupations.

{"text": "We have already seen, in general, that what a man _is_ contributes\nmuch more to his happiness than what he _has_, or how he is regarded\nby others. What a man is, and so what he has in his own person, is\nalways the chief thing to consider; for his individuality accompanies\nhim always and everywhere, and gives its color to all his experiences.\nIn every kind of enjoyment, for instance, the pleasure depends\nprincipally upon the man himself. Every one admits this in regard to\nphysical, and how much truer it is of intellectual, pleasure. When we\nuse that English expression, \"to enjoy one's self,\" we are employing a\nvery striking and appropriate phrase; for observe--one says, not \"he\nenjoys Paris,\" but \"he enjoys himself in Paris.\" To a man possessed of\nan ill-conditioned individuality, all pleasure is like delicate wine\nin a mouth made bitter with gall. Therefore, in the blessings as well\nas in the ills of life, less depends upon what befalls us than upon\nthe way in which it is met, that is, upon the kind and degree of our\ngeneral susceptibility. What a man is and has in himself,--in a word\npersonality, with all it entails, is the only immediate and direct\nfactor in his happiness and welfare. All else is mediate and indirect,\nand its influence can be neutralized and frustrated; but the influence\nof personality never. This is why the envy which personal qualities\nexcite is the most implacable of all,--as it is also the most\ncarefully dissembled.\n\nFurther, the constitution of our consciousness is the ever present\nand lasting element in all we do or suffer; our individuality is\npersistently at work, more or less, at every moment of our life: all\nother influences are temporal, incidental, fleeting, and subject to\nevery kind of chance and change. This is why Aristotle says: _It is\nnot wealth but character that lasts_.[1]\n\n  [Greek: --hae gar phusis bebion ou ta chraemata]\n\n[Footnote 1: Eth.

{"text": "And of all these, the one which makes us the most directly happy is\na genial flow of good spirits; for this excellent quality is its own\nimmediate reward. The man who is cheerful and merry has always a\ngood reason for being so,--the fact, namely, that he is so. There is\nnothing which, like this quality, can so completely replace the loss\nof every other blessing. If you know anyone who is young, handsome,\nrich and esteemed, and you want to know, further, if he is happy, ask,\nIs he cheerful and genial?--and if he is, what does it matter whether\nhe is young or old, straight or humpbacked, poor or rich?--he is\nhappy. In my early days I once opened an old book and found these\nwords: _If you laugh a great deal, you are happy; if you cry a great\ndeal, you are unhappy_;--a very simple remark, no doubt; but just\nbecause it is so simple I have never been able to forget it, even\nthough it is in the last degree a truism. So if cheerfulness knocks\nat our door, we should throw it wide open, for it never comes\ninopportunely; instead of that, we often make scruples about letting\nit in. We want to be quite sure that we have every reason to be\ncontented; then we are afraid that cheerfulness of spirits may\ninterfere with serious reflections or weighty cares. Cheerfulness is a\ndirect and immediate gain,--the very coin, as it were, of happiness,\nand not, like all else, merely a cheque upon the bank; for it alone\nmakes us immediately happy in the present moment, and that is the\nhighest blessing for beings like us, whose existence is but an\ninfinitesimal moment between two eternities.

{"text": "Now it is certain that nothing contributes so little to cheerfulness\nas riches, or so much, as health. Is it not in the lower classes, the\nso-called working classes, more especially those of them who live in\nthe country, that we see cheerful and contented faces? and is it\nnot amongst the rich, the upper classes, that we find faces full of\nill-humor and vexation? Consequently we should try as much as possible\nto maintain a high degree of health; for cheerfulness is the very\nflower of it. I need hardly say what one must do to be healthy--avoid\nevery kind of excess, all violent and unpleasant emotion, all mental\noverstrain, take daily exercise in the open air, cold baths and such\nlike hygienic measures. For without a proper amount of daily exercise\nno one can remain healthy; all the processes of life demand exercise\nfor the due performance of their functions, exercise not only of the\nparts more immediately concerned, but also of the whole body. For, as\nAristotle rightly says, _Life is movement_; it is its very essence.\nCeaseless and rapid motion goes on in every part of the organism.\nThe heart, with its complicated double systole and diastole, beats\nstrongly and untiringly; with twenty-eight beats it has to drive the\nwhole of the blood through arteries, veins and capillaries; the lungs\npump like a steam-engine, without intermission; the intestines are\nalways in peristaltic action; the glands are all constantly absorbing\nand secreting; even the brain has a double motion of its own, with\nevery beat of the pulse and every breath we draw. When people can get\nno exercise at all, as is the case with the countless numbers who\nare condemned to a sedentary life, there is a glaring and fatal\ndisproportion between outward inactivity and inner tumult. For this\nceaseless internal motion requires some external counterpart, and the\nwant of it produces effects like those of emotion which we are obliged\nto suppress. Even trees must be shaken by the wind, if they are to\nthrive.

{"text": "How much our happiness depends upon our spirits, and these again upon\nour state of health, may be seen by comparing the influence which the\nsame external circumstances or events have upon us when we are well\nand strong with the effects which they have when we are depressed and\ntroubled with ill-health. It is not what things are objectively and in\nthemselves, but what they are for us, in our way of looking at them,\nthat makes us happy or the reverse. As Epictetus says, _Men are not\ninfluenced by things, but by their thoughts about things_. And, in\ngeneral, nine-tenths of our happiness depends upon health alone. With\nhealth, everything is a source of pleasure; without it, nothing\nelse, whatever it may be, is enjoyable; even the other personal\nblessings,--a great mind, a happy temperament--are degraded and\ndwarfed for want of it. So it is really with good reason that, when\ntwo people meet, the first thing they do is to inquire after each\nother's health, and to express the hope that it is good; for good\nhealth is by far the most important element in human happiness. It\nfollows from all this that the greatest of follies is to sacrifice\nhealth for any other kind of happiness, whatever it may be, for gain,\nadvancement, learning or fame, let alone, then, for fleeting sensual\npleasures.

The ultimate cause of this is undoubtedly to be\nfound in innate, and therefore unalterable, physical constitution,\nespecially in the more or less normal relation of a man's\nsensitiveness to his muscular and vital energy. Abnormal sensitiveness\nproduces inequality of spirits, a predominating melancholy, with\nperiodical fits of unrestrained liveliness. A genius is one whose\nnervous power or sensitiveness is largely in excess; as Aristotle[1]\nhas very correctly observed, _Men distinguished in philosophy,\npolitics, poetry or art appear to be all of a melancholy temperament_.\nThis is doubtless the passage which Cicero has in his mind when\nhe says, as he often does, _Aristoteles ait omnes ingeniosos\nmelancholicos esse_.[2] Shakespeare has very neatly expressed this\nradical and innate diversity of temperament in those lines in _The\nMerchant of Venice_:\n\n[Footnote 1: Probl. xxx., ep. 1]\n\n[Footnote 2: Tusc. i., 33.]\n\n  _Nature has framed strange fellows in her time;\n  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,\n  And laugh, like parrots at a bag-piper;\n  And others of such vinegar aspect,\n  That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,\n  Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable_.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

On the other\nhand, the [Greek: eukolos] will neither worry nor fret over an\nunfavorable issue, but rejoice if it turns out well. If the one is\nsuccessful in nine out of ten undertakings, he will not be pleased,\nbut rather annoyed that one has miscarried; whilst the other, if only\na single one succeeds, will manage to find consolation in the fact\nand remain cheerful. But here is another instance of the truth,\nthat hardly any evil is entirely without its compensation; for the\nmisfortunes and sufferings which the [Greek: auskoloi], that is,\npeople of gloomy and anxious character, have to overcome, are, on the\nwhole, more imaginary and therefore less real than those which befall\nthe gay and careless; for a man who paints everything black, who\nconstantly fears the worst and takes measures accordingly, will not be\ndisappointed so often in this world, as one who always looks upon the\nbright side of things. And when a morbid affection of the nerves, or a\nderangement of the digestive organs, plays into the hands of an\ninnate tendency to gloom, this tendency may reach such a height that\npermanent discomfort produces a weariness of life. So arises an\ninclination to suicide, which even the most trivial unpleasantness may\nactually bring about; nay, when the tendency attains its worst form,\nit may be occasioned by nothing in particular, but a man may resolve\nto put an end to his existence, simply because he is permanently\nunhappy, and then coolly and firmly carry out his determination;\nas may be seen by the way in which the sufferer, when placed under\nsupervision, as he usually is, eagerly waits to seize the first\nunguarded moment, when, without a shudder, without a struggle or\nrecoil, he may use the now natural and welcome means of effecting his\nrelease.[1] Even the healthiest, perhaps even the most cheerful\nman, may resolve upon death under certain circumstances; when, for\ninstance, his sufferings, or his fears of some inevitable misfortune,\nreach such a pitch as to outweigh the terrors of death. The only\ndifference lies in the degree of suffering necessary to bring about\nthe fatal act, a degree which will be high in the case of a cheerful,\nand low in that of a gloomy man. The greater the melancholy, the lower\nneed the degree be; in the end, it may even sink to zero. But if a man\nis cheerful, and his spirits are supported by good health, it requires\na high degree of suffering to make him lay hands upon himself.

Life presents, in fact, a more or less violent oscillation\nbetween the two. The reason of this is that each of these two poles\nstands in a double antagonism to the other, external or objective,\nand inner or subjective. Needy surroundings and poverty produce pain;\nwhile, if a man is more than well off, he is bored. Accordingly, while\nthe lower classes are engaged in a ceaseless struggle with need,\nin other words, with pain, the upper carry on a constant and often\ndesperate battle with boredom.[1] The inner or subjective antagonism\narises from the fact that, in the individual, susceptibility to\npain varies inversely with susceptibility to boredom, because\nsusceptibility is directly proportionate to mental power. Let\nme explain. A dull mind is, as a rule, associated with dull\nsensibilities, nerves which no stimulus can affect, a temperament, in\nshort, which does not feel pain or anxiety very much, however great\nor terrible it may be. Now, intellectual dullness is at the bottom of\nthat _vacuity of soul_ which is stamped on so many faces, a state of\nmind which betrays itself by a constant and lively attention to all\nthe trivial circumstances in the external world. This is the true\nsource of boredom--a continual panting after excitement, in order to\nhave a pretext for giving the mind and spirits something to occupy\nthem. The kind of things people choose for this purpose shows that\nthey are not very particular, as witness the miserable pastimes they\nhave recourse to, and their ideas of social pleasure and conversation:\nor again, the number of people who gossip on the doorstep or gape out\nof the window. It is mainly because of this inner vacuity of soul that\npeople go in quest of society, diversion, amusement, luxury of every\nsort, which lead many to extravagance and misery. Nothing is so good\na protection against such misery as inward wealth, the wealth of\nthe mind, because the greater it grows, the less room it leaves for\nboredom. The inexhaustible activity of thought! Finding ever new\nmaterial to work upon in the multifarious phenomena of self and\nnature, and able and ready to form new combinations of them,--there\nyou have something that invigorates the mind, and apart from moments\nof relaxation, sets it far above the reach of boredom.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

This applies, in various\ndegrees, to every step in the long scale of mental power, from the\nveriest dunce to the greatest genius that ever lived. Therefore the\nnearer anyone is, either from a subjective or from an objective point\nof view, to one of those sources of suffering in human life, the\nfarther he is from the other.

The wise man will,\nabove all, strive after freedom from pain and annoyance, quiet and\nleisure, consequently a tranquil, modest life, with as few encounters\nas may be; and so, after a little experience of his so-called\nfellowmen, he will elect to live in retirement, or even, if he is\na man of great intellect, in solitude. For the more a man has in\nhimself, the less he will want from other people,--the less, indeed,\nother people can be to him. This is why a high degree of intellect\ntends to make a man unsocial.

{"text": "The brain may be regarded as a kind of parasite of the organism, a\npensioner, as it were, who dwells with the body: and leisure, that\nis, the time one has for the free enjoyment of one's consciousness or\nindividuality, is the fruit or produce of the rest of existence, which\nis in general only labor and effort. But what does most people's\nleisure yield?--boredom and dullness; except, of course, when it is\noccupied with sensual pleasure or folly. How little such leisure is\nworth may be seen in the way in which it is spent: and, as Ariosto\nobserves, how miserable are the idle hours of ignorant men!--_ozio\nlungo d'uomini ignoranti_. Ordinary people think merely how they shall\n_spend_ their time; a man of any talent tries to _use_ it. The reason\nwhy people of limited intellect are apt to be bored is that their\nintellect is absolutely nothing more than the means by which the\nmotive power of the will is put into force: and whenever there is\nnothing particular to set the will in motion, it rests, and their\nintellect takes a holiday, because, equally with the will, it requires\nsomething external to bring it into play. The result is an awful\nstagnation of whatever power a man has--in a word, boredom. To\ncounteract this miserable feeling, men run to trivialities which\nplease for the moment they are taken up, hoping thus to engage the\nwill in order to rouse it to action, and so set the intellect in\nmotion; for it is the latter which has to give effect to these motives\nof the will. Compared with real and natural motives, these are but as\npaper money to coin; for their value is only arbitrary--card games and\nthe like, which have been invented for this very purpose. And if there\nis nothing else to be done, a man will twirl his thumbs or beat the\ndevil's tattoo; or a cigar may be a welcome substitute for exercising\nhis brains. Hence, in all countries the chief occupation of society is\ncard-playing,[1] and it is the gauge of its value, and an outward sign\nthat it is bankrupt in thought. Because people have no thoughts to\ndeal in, they deal cards, and try and win one another's money. Idiots!\nBut I do not wish to be unjust; so let me remark that it may certainly\nbe said in defence of card-playing that it is a preparation for the\nworld and for business life, because one learns thereby how to make a\nclever use of fortuitous but unalterable circumstances (cards, in this\ncase), and to get as much out of them as one can: and to do this a man\nmust learn a little dissimulation, and how to put a good face upon a\nbad business. But, on the other hand, it is exactly for this reason\nthat card-playing is so demoralizing, since the whole object of it is\nto employ every kind of trick and machination in order to win\nwhat belongs to another. And a habit of this sort, learnt at the\ncard-table, strikes root and pushes its way into practical life; and\nin the affairs of every day a man gradually comes to regard _meum_ and\n_tuum_ in much the same light as cards, and to consider that he may\nuse to the utmost whatever advantages he possesses, so long as he does\nnot come within the arm of the law. Examples of what I mean are of\ndaily occurrence in mercantile life. Since, then, leisure is the\nflower, or rather the fruit, of existence, as it puts a man into\npossession of himself, those are happy indeed who possess something\nreal in themselves. But what do you get from most people's\nleisure?--only a good-for-nothing fellow, who is terribly bored and a\nburden to himself.

For\nall other sources of happiness are in their nature most uncertain,\nprecarious, fleeting, the sport of chance; and so even under the most\nfavorable circumstances they can easily be exhausted; nay, this is\nunavoidable, because they are not always within reach.

The doctrine of\nAristotle's, that a man's happiness consists in the free exercise\nof his highest faculties, is also enunciated by Stobaeus in his\nexposition of the Peripatetic philosophy[2]: _happiness_, he says,\n_means vigorous and successful activity in all your undertakings_; and\nhe explains that by _vigor [Greek: aretae]_ he means _mastery_ in any\nthing, whatever it be.

{"text": "But there is something to be said in opposition to this view. Great\nintellectual gifts mean an activity pre-eminently nervous in its\ncharacter, and consequently a very high degree of susceptibility to\npain in every form. Further, such gifts imply an intense temperament,\nlarger and more vivid ideas, which, as the inseparable accompaniment\nof great intellectual power, entail on its possessor a corresponding\nintensity of the emotions, making them incomparably more violent than\nthose to which the ordinary man is a prey. Now, there are more things\nin the world productive of pain than of pleasure. Again, a large\nendowment of intellect tends to estrange the man who has it from other\npeople and their doings; for the more a man has in himself, the less\nhe will be able to find in them; and the hundred things in which they\ntake delight, he will think shallow and insipid. Here, then, perhaps,\nis another instance of that law of compensation which makes itself\nfelt everywhere. How often one hears it said, and said, too, with some\nplausibility, that the narrow-minded man is at bottom the happiest,\neven though his fortune is unenviable. I shall make no attempt to\nforestall the reader's own judgment on this point; more especially as\nSophocles himself has given utterance to two diametrically opposite\nopinions:--\n\n  [Greek: Pollo to phronein eudaimonias\n  proton uparchei.][1]\n\nhe says in one place--wisdom is the greatest part of happiness;\nand again, in another passage, he declares that the life of the\nthoughtless is the most pleasant of all--\n\n  [Greek: En ta phronein gar maeden aedistos bios.][2]\n\nThe philosophers of the _Old Testament_ find themselves in a like\ncontradiction.\n\n_The life of a fool is worse than death_[3]\n\nand--\n\n_In much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge\nincreaseth sorrow_.[4]\n\n[Footnote 1: Antigone, 1347-8.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Ajax, 554.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Ecclesiasticus, xxii. 11.]\n\n[Footnote 4: Ecclesiastes, i. 18.]", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "I may remark, however, that a man who has no mental needs, because his\nintellect is of the narrow and normal amount, is, in the strict sense\nof the word, what is called a _philistine_--an expression at first\npeculiar to the German language, a kind of slang term at the\nUniversities, afterwards used, by analogy, in a higher sense, though\nstill in its original meaning, as denoting one who is not _a Son of\nthe Muses_. A philistine is and remains [Greek: amousos anaer]. I\nshould prefer to take a higher point of view, and apply the term\n_philistine_ to people who are always seriously occupied with\nrealities which are no realities; but as such a definition would be a\ntranscendental one, and therefore not generally intelligible, it\nwould hardly be in place in the present treatise, which aims at\nbeing popular. The other definition can be more easily elucidated,\nindicating, as it does, satisfactorily enough, the essential nature of\nall those qualities which distinguish the philistine. He is defined to\nbe _a man without mental needs_. From this is follows, firstly, _in\nrelation to himself_, that he has _no intellectual pleasures_; for, as\nwas remarked before, there are no real pleasures without real needs.\nThe philistine's life is animated by no desire to gain knowledge and\ninsight for their own sake, or to experience that true aeesthetic\npleasure which is so nearly akin to them. If pleasures of this kind\nare fashionable, and the philistine finds himself compelled to pay\nattention to them, he will force himself to do so, but he will take as\nlittle interest in them as possible. His only real pleasures are of a\nsensual kind, and he thinks that these indemnify him for the loss of\nthe others. To him oysters and champagne are the height of existence;\nthe aim of his life is to procure what will contribute to his bodily\nwelfare, and he is indeed in a happy way if this causes him some\ntrouble. If the luxuries of life are heaped upon him, he will\ninevitably be bored, and against boredom he has a great many fancied\nremedies, balls, theatres, parties, cards, gambling, horses, women,\ndrinking, traveling and so on; all of which can not protect a man\nfrom being bored, for where there are no intellectual needs, no\nintellectual pleasures are possible. The peculiar characteristic\nof the philistine is a dull, dry kind of gravity, akin to that of\nanimals. Nothing really pleases, or excites, or interests him, for\nsensual pleasure is quickly exhausted, and the society of philistines\nsoon becomes burdensome, and one may even get tired of playing cards.\nTrue, the pleasures of vanity are left, pleasures which he enjoys in\nhis own way, either by feeling himself superior in point of wealth, or\nrank, or influence and power to other people, who thereupon pay\nhim honor; or, at any rate, by going about with those who have a\nsuperfluity of these blessings, sunning himself in the reflection of\ntheir splendor--what the English call a _snob_.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "From the essential nature of the philistine it follows, secondly, _in\nregard to others_, that, as he possesses no intellectual, but only\nphysical need, he will seek the society of those who can satisfy the\nlatter, but not the former. The last thing he will expect from his\nfriends is the possession of any sort of intellectual capacity; nay,\nif he chances to meet with it, it will rouse his antipathy and\neven hatred; simply because in addition to an unpleasant sense of\ninferiority, he experiences, in his heart, a dull kind of envy, which\nhas to be carefully concealed even from himself. Nevertheless, it\nsometimes grows into a secret feeling of rancor. But for all that,\nit will never occur to him to make his own ideas of worth or value\nconform to the standard of such qualities; he will continue to give\nthe preference to rank and riches, power and influence, which in his\neyes seem to be the only genuine advantages in the world; and his wish\nwill be to excel in them himself. All this is the consequence of his\nbeing a man _without intellectual needs_. The great affliction of all\nphilistines is that they have no interest in _ideas_, and that, to\nescape being bored, they are in constant need of _realities_. But\nrealities are either unsatisfactory or dangerous; when they lose their\ninterest, they become fatiguing. But the ideal world is illimitable\nand calm,\n\n  _something afar\n  From the sphere of our sorrow_.\n\nNOTE.--In these remarks on the personal qualities which go to make\nhappiness, I have been mainly concerned with the physical and\nintellectual nature of man.

I may add, however, that in the report given by\nDiogenes Laertius, Epicurus does not mention which of the senses he\nmeans; so that on this point my account of his doctrine is somewhat\nmore definite and exact than the original.

{"text": "It is difficult, if not impossible, to define the limits which reason\nshould impose on the desire for wealth; for there is no absolute or\ndefinite amount of wealth which will satisfy a man. The amount is\nalways relative, that is to say, just so much as will maintain the\nproportion between what he wants and what he gets; for to measure a\nman's happiness only by what he gets, and not also by what he expects\nto get, is as futile as to try and express a fraction which shall have\na numerator but no denominator. A man never feels the loss of things\nwhich it never occurs to him to ask for; he is just as happy without\nthem; whilst another, who may have a hundred times as much, feels\nmiserable because he has not got the one thing he wants. In fact, here\ntoo, every man has an horizon of his own, and he will expect as much\nas he thinks it is possible for him to get. If an object within his\nhorizon looks as though he could confidently reckon on getting it, he\nis happy; but if difficulties come in the way, he is miserable. What\nlies beyond his horizon has no effect at all upon him. So it is\nthat the vast possessions of the rich do not agitate the poor, and\nconversely, that a wealthy man is not consoled by all his wealth for\nthe failure of his hopes. Riches, one may say, are like sea-water; the\nmore you drink the thirstier you become; and the same is true of fame.\nThe loss of wealth and prosperity leaves a man, as soon as the first\npangs of grief are over, in very much the same habitual temper as\nbefore; and the reason of this is, that as soon as fate diminishes the\namount of his possessions, he himself immediately reduces the amount\nof his claims. But when misfortune comes upon us, to reduce the amount\nof our claims is just what is most painful; once that we have done so,\nthe pain becomes less and less, and is felt no more; like an old wound\nwhich has healed. Conversely, when a piece of good fortune befalls us,\nour claims mount higher and higher, as there is nothing to regulate\nthem; it is in this feeling of expansion that the delight of it lies.\nBut it lasts no longer than the process itself, and when the expansion\nis complete, the delight ceases; we have become accustomed to the\nincrease in our claims, and consequently indifferent to the amount of\nwealth which satisfies them.

People who are not born with a fortune, but end by\nmaking a large one through the exercise of whatever talents they\npossess, almost always come to think that their talents are their\ncapital, and that the money they have gained is merely the interest\nupon it; they do not lay by a part of their earnings to form a\npermanent capital, but spend their money much as they have earned it.\nAccordingly, they often fall into poverty; their earnings decreased,\nor come to an end altogether, either because their talent is exhausted\nby becoming antiquated,--as, for instance, very often happens in\nthe case of fine art; or else it was valid only under a special\nconjunction of circumstances which has now passed away. There is\nnothing to prevent those who live on the common labor of their hands\nfrom treating their earnings in that way if they like; because their\nkind of skill is not likely to disappear, or, if it does, it can be\nreplaced by that of their fellow-workmen; morever, the kind of work\nthey do is always in demand; so that what the proverb says is quite\ntrue, _a useful trade is a mine of gold_.

So most of them\nmaintain their position. These few remarks about capital and interest\nare not applicable to commercial life, for merchants look upon money\nonly as a means of further gain, just as a workman regards his tools;\nso even if their capital has been entirely the result of their\nown efforts, they try to preserve and increase it by using it.\nAccordingly, wealth is nowhere so much at home as in the merchant\nclass.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "It will generally be found that those who know what it is to have\nbeen in need and destitution are very much less afraid of it, and\nconsequently more inclined to extravagance, than those who know\npoverty only by hearsay. People who have been born and bred in good\ncircumstances are as a rule much more careful about the future, more\neconomical, in fact, than those who, by a piece of good luck, have\nsuddenly passed from poverty to wealth.

For, after all,\nthe foundation of our whole nature, and, therefore, of our happiness,\nis our physique, and the most essential factor in happiness is\nhealth, and, next in importance after health, the ability to maintain\nourselves in independence and freedom from care. There can be no\ncompetition or compensation between these essential factors on the one\nside, and honor, pomp, rank and reputation on the other, however much\nvalue we may set upon the latter. No one would hesitate to sacrifice\nthe latter for the former, if it were necessary. We should add very\nmuch to our happiness by a timely recognition of the simple truth that\nevery man's chief and real existence is in his own skin, and not in\nother people's opinions; and, consequently, that the actual conditions\nof our personal life,--health, temperament, capacity, income, wife,\nchildren, friends, home, are a hundred times more important for our\nhappiness than what other people are pleased to think of us: otherwise\nwe shall be miserable.

Undoubtedly this feeling is a\nvery convenient instrument in the hands of those who have the control\nor direction of their fellowmen; and accordingly we find that in\nevery scheme for training up humanity in the way it should go, the\nmaintenance and strengthening of the feeling of honor occupies an\nimportant place. But it is quite a different matter in its effect\non human happiness, of which it is here our object to treat; and we\nshould rather be careful to dissuade people from setting too much\nstore by what others think of them. Daily experience shows us,\nhowever, that this is just the mistake people persist in making; most\nmen set the utmost value precisely on what other people think, and\nare more concerned about it than about what goes on in their own\nconsciousness, which is the thing most immediately and directly\npresent to them. They reverse the natural order,--regarding the\nopinions of others as real existence and their own consciousness\nas something shadowy; making the derivative and secondary into the\nprincipal, and considering the picture they present to the world of\nmore importance than their own selves. By thus trying to get a direct\nand immediate result out of what has no really direct or immediate\nexistence, they fall into the kind of folly which is called\n_vanity_--the appropriate term for that which has no solid or\ninstrinsic value.

Tacitus says, _The lust of fame is the last that a wise man\nshakes off_[1] The only way of putting an end to this universal\nfolly is to see clearly that it is a folly; and this may be done by\nrecognizing the fact that most of the opinions in men's heads are apt\nto be false, perverse, erroneous and absurd, and so in themselves\nunworthy of attention; further, that other people's opinions can\nhave very little real and positive influence upon us in most of the\ncircumstances and affairs of life. Again, this opinion is generally of\nsuch an unfavorable character that it would worry a man to death to\nhear everything that was said of him, or the tone in which he was\nspoken of.

It is observable that a retired\nmode of life has an exceedingly beneficial influence on our peace\nof mind, and this is mainly because we thus escape having to live\nconstantly in the sight of others, and pay everlasting regard to their\ncasual opinions; in a word, we are able to return upon ourselves. At\nthe same time a good deal of positive misfortune might be avoided,\nwhich we are now drawn into by striving after shadows, or, to speak\nmore correctly, by indulging a mischievous piece of folly; and we\nshould consequently have more attention to give to solid realities and\nenjoy them with less interruption that at present.

Pride works _from within_; it is the direct\nappreciation of oneself. Vanity is the desire to arrive at this\nappreciation indirectly, _from without_. So we find that vain people\nare talkative, proud, and taciturn. But the vain person ought to be\naware that the good opinion of others, which he strives for, may be\nobtained much more easily and certainly by persistent silence than by\nspeech, even though he has very good things to say. Anyone who wishes\nto affect pride is not therefore a proud man; but he will soon have to\ndrop this, as every other, assumed character.\n\nIt is only a firm, unshakeable conviction of pre-eminent worth and\nspecial value which makes a man proud in the true sense of the\nword,--a conviction which may, no doubt, be a mistaken one or rest on\nadvantages which are of an adventitious and conventional character:\nstill pride is not the less pride for all that, so long as it be\npresent in real earnest.

{"text": "The feelings of honor and shame exist in every man who is not utterly\ndepraved, and honor is everywhere recognized as something particularly\nvaluable. The reason of this is as follows. By and in himself a man\ncan accomplish very little; he is like Robinson Crusoe on a desert\nisland. It is only in society that a man's powers can be called into\nfull activity. He very soon finds this out when his consciousness\nbegins to develop, and there arises in him the desire to be looked\nupon as a useful member of society, as one, that is, who is capable\nof playing his part as a man--_pro parte virili_--thereby acquiring a\nright to the benefits of social life. Now, to be a useful member of\nsociety, one must do two things: firstly, what everyone is expected to\ndo everywhere; and, secondly, what one's own particular position in\nthe world demands and requires.\n\nBut a man soon discovers that everything depends upon his being\nuseful, not in his own opinion, but in the opinion of others; and so\nhe tries his best to make that favorable impression upon the world, to\nwhich he attaches such a high value. Hence, this primitive and innate\ncharacteristic of human nature, which is called the feeling of honor,\nor, under another aspect, the feeling of shame--_verecundia_. It is\nthis which brings a blush to his cheeks at the thought of having\nsuddenly to fall in the estimation of others, even when he knows that\nhe is innocent, nay, even if his remissness extends to no absolute\nobligation, but only to one which he has taken upon himself of his own\nfree will. Conversely, nothing in life gives a man so much courage as\nthe attainment or renewal of the conviction that other people regard\nhim with favor; because it means that everyone joins to give him help\nand protection, which is an infinitely stronger bulwark against the\nills of life than anything he can do himself.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "The variety of relations in which a man can stand to other people so\nas to obtain their confidence, that is, their good opinion, gives rise\nto a distinction between several kinds of honor, resting chiefly on\nthe different bearings that _meum_ may take to _tuum_; or, again, on\nthe performance of various pledges; or finally, on the relation of the\nsexes. Hence, there are three main kinds of honor, each of which takes\nvarious forms--civic honor, official honor, and sexual honor.\n\n_Civic honor_ has the widest sphere of all. It consists in the\nassumption that we shall pay unconditional respect to the rights of\nothers, and, therefore, never use any unjust or unlawful means of\ngetting what we want. It is the condition of all peaceable intercourse\nbetween man and man; and it is destroyed by anything that openly and\nmanifestly militates against this peaceable intercourse, anything,\naccordingly, which entails punishment at the hands of the law, always\nsupposing that the punishment is a just one.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "The ultimate foundation of honor is the conviction that moral\ncharacter is unalterable: a single bad action implies that future\nactions of the same kind will, under similar circumstances, also be\nbad.

Hence honor, once lost, can\nnever be recovered; unless the loss rested on some mistake, such as\nmay occur if a man is slandered or his actions viewed in a false\nlight. So the law provides remedies against slander, libel, and even\ninsult; for insult though it amounts to no more than mere abuse, is a\nkind of summary slander with a suppression of the reasons. What I\nmean may be well put in the Greek phrase--not quoted from any\nauthor--[Greek: estin hae loidoria diabolae]. It is true that if a\nman abuses another, he is simply showing that he has no real or true\ncauses of complaint against him; as, otherwise, he would bring these\nforward as the premises, and rely upon his hearers to draw the\nconclusion themselves: instead of which, he gives the conclusion and\nleaves out the premises, trusting that people will suppose that he has\ndone so only for the sake of being brief.\n\nCivic honor draws its existence and name from the middle classes;\nbut it applies equally to all, not excepting the highest. No man can\ndisregard it, and it is a very serious thing, of which every one\nshould be careful not to make light.

Honor, therefore, means that a man is not\nexceptional; fame, that he is. Fame is something which must be won;\nhonor, only something which must not be lost. The absence of fame is\nobscurity, which is only a negative; but loss of honor is shame, which\nis a positive quality. This negative character of honor must not be\nconfused with anything _passive_; for honor is above all things active\nin its working.

So an arrangement is made for mutual\ninterdependence--man undertaking responsibility for all woman's needs\nand also for the children that spring from their union--an arrangement\non which is based the welfare of the whole female race. To carry out\nthis plan, women have to band together with a show of _esprit de\ncorps_, and present one undivided front to their common enemy,\nman,--who possesses all the good things of the earth, in virtue of his\nsuperior physical and intellectual power,--in order to lay siege to\nand conquer him, and so get possession of him and a share of those\ngood things.

One\nmight go so far as to say that its value is purely conventional, when\none sees from Thomasius how in all ages and countries, up to the time\nof the Reformation, irregularities were permitted and recognized by\nlaw, with no derogation to female honor,--not to speak of the temple\nof Mylitta at Babylon.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Heroditus, i. 199.]", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "There are also of course certain circumstances in civil life which\nmake external forms of marriage impossible, especially in Catholic\ncountries, where there is no such thing as divorce. Ruling princes\neverywhere, would, in my opinion, do much better, from a moral point\nof view, to dispense with forms altogether rather than contract a\nmorganatic marriage, the descendants of which might raise claims to\nthe throne if the legitimate stock happened to die out; so that there\nis a possibility, though, perhaps, a remote one, that a morganatic\nmarriage might produce a civil war. And, besides, such a marriage,\nconcluded in defiance of all outward ceremony, is a concession made to\nwomen and priests--two classes of persons to whom one should be most\ncareful to give as little tether as possible. It is further to be\nremarked that every man in a country can marry the woman of his\nchoice, except one poor individual, namely, the prince. His hand\nbelongs to his country, and can be given in marriage only for reasons\nof State, that is, for the good of the country. Still, for all that,\nhe is a man; and, as a man, he likes to follow whither his heart\nleads. It is an unjust, ungrateful and priggish thing to forbid, or\nto desire to forbid, a prince from following his inclinations in this\nmatter; of course, as long as the lady has no influence upon the\nGovernment of the country. From her point of view she occupies an\nexceptional position, and does not come under the ordinary rules of\nsexual honor; for she has merely given herself to a man who loves her,\nand whom she loves but cannot marry. And in general, the fact that the\nprinciple of female honor has no origin in nature, is shown by the\nmany bloody sacrifices which have been offered to it,--the murder of\nchildren and the mother's suicide. No doubt a girl who contravenes the\ncode commits a breach of faith against her whole sex; but this faith\nis one which is only secretly taken for granted, and not sworn to.

{"text": "The corresponding virtue in men is a product of the one I have been\ndiscussing. It is their _esprit de corps_, which demands that, once\na man has made that surrender of himself in marriage which is so\nadvantageous to his conqueror, he shall take care that the terms of\nthe treaty are maintained; both in order that the agreement itself\nmay lose none of its force by the permission of any laxity in its\nobservance, and that men, having given up everything, may, at\nleast, be assured of their bargain, namely, exclusive possession.\nAccordingly, it is part of a man's honor to resent a breach of the\nmarriage tie on the part of his wife, and to punish it, at the\nvery least by separating from her. If he condones the offence, his\nfellowmen cry shame upon him; but the shame in this case is not nearly\nso foul as that of the woman who has lost her honor; the stain is by\nno means of so deep a dye--_levioris notae macula_;--because a man's\nrelation to woman is subordinate to many other and more important\naffairs in his life. The two great dramatic poets of modern times\nhave each taken man's honor as the theme of two plays; Shakespeare in\n_Othello_ and _The Winter's Tale_, and Calderon in _El medico de su\nhonra_, (The Physician of his Honor), and _A secreto agravio secreta\nvenganza_, (for Secret Insult Secret Vengeance).

It is a kind of honor which arose\nonly in the Middle Age, and is indigenous only to Christian Europe,\nnay, only to an extremely small portion of the population, that is\nto say, the higher classes of society and those who ape them. It is\n_knightly honor_, or _point d'honneur_. Its principles are quite\ndifferent from those which underlie the kind of honor I have been\ntreating until now, and in some respects are even opposed to them. The\nsort I am referring to produces the _cavalier_; while the other kind\ncreates the _man of honor_.

{"text": "(1.) To begin with, honor of this sort consists, not in other people's\nopinion of what we are worth, but wholly and entirely in whether they\nexpress it or not, no matter whether they really have any opinion at\nall, let alone whether they know of reasons for having one. Other\npeople may entertain the worst opinion of us in consequence of what we\ndo, and may despise us as much as they like; so long as no one dares\nto give expression to his opinion, our honor remains untarnished. So\nif our actions and qualities compel the highest respect from other\npeople, and they have no option but to give this respect,--as soon as\nanyone, no matter how wicked or foolish he may be, utters something\ndepreciatory of us, our honor is offended, nay, gone for ever, unless\nwe can manage to restore it. A superfluous proof of what I say,\nnamely, that knightly honor depends, not upon what people think, but\nupon what they say, is furnished by the fact that insults can be\nwithdrawn, or, if necessary, form the subject of an apology, which\nmakes them as though they had never been uttered. Whether the opinion\nwhich underlays the expression has also been rectified, and why\nthe expression should ever have been used, are questions which are\nperfectly unimportant: so long as the statement is withdrawn, all is\nwell. The truth is that conduct of this kind aims, not at earning\nrespect, but at extorting it.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "(2.) In the second place, this sort of honor rests, not on what a man\ndoes, but on what he suffers, the obstacles he encounters; differing\nfrom the honor which prevails in all else, in consisting, not in what\nhe says or does himself, but in what another man says or does. His\nhonor is thus at the mercy of every man who can talk it away on the\ntip of his tongue; and if he attacks it, in a moment it is gone for\never,--unless the man who is attacked manages to wrest it back again\nby a process which I shall mention presently, a process which involves\ndanger to his life, health, freedom, property and peace of mind. A\nman's whole conduct may be in accordance with the most righteous and\nnoble principles, his spirit may be the purest that ever breathed, his\nintellect of the very highest order; and yet his honor may disappear\nthe moment that anyone is pleased to insult him, anyone at all who has\nnot offended against this code of honor himself, let him be the most\nworthless rascal or the most stupid beast, an idler, gambler, debtor,\na man, in short, of no account at all. It is usually this sort of\nfellow who likes to insult people; for, as Seneca[1] rightly remarks,\n_ut quisque contemtissimus et ludibrio est, ita solutissimae est_, the\nmore contemptible and ridiculous a man is,--the readier he is with his\ntongue. His insults are most likely to be directed against the very\nkind of man I have described, because people of different tastes can\nnever be friends, and the sight of pre-eminent merit is apt to\nraise the secret ire of a ne'er-do-well. What Goethe says in the\n_West\u00f6stlicher Divan_ is quite true, that it is useless to complain\nagainst your enemies; for they can never become your friends, if your\nwhole being is a standing reproach to them:--\n\n  _Was klagst du \u00fcber Feinde?\n  Sollten Solche je warden Freunde\n  Denen das Wesen, wie du bist,\n  Im stillen ein ewiger Vorwurf ist_?\n\n[Footnote 1: _De Constantia_, 11.]", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

In other words,\nthe man who is insulted remains--in the eyes of all _honorable\npeople_--what the man who uttered the insult--even though he were the\ngreatest wretch on earth--was pleased to call him; for he has _put\nup with_ the insult--the technical term, I believe.

{"text": "This wise proceeding may, I think, be traced back to the fact that in\nthe Middle Age, up to the fifteenth century, it was not the accuser in\nany criminal process who had to prove the guilt of the accused, but\nthe accused who had to prove his innocence.[1] This he could do by\nswearing he was not guilty; and his backers--_consacramentales_--had\nto come and swear that in their opinion he was incapable of perjury.\nIf he could find no one to help him in this way, or the accuser took\nobjection to his backers, recourse was had to trial by _the Judgment\nof God_, which generally meant a duel. For the accused was now _in\ndisgrace_,[2] and had to clear himself. Here, then, is the origin\nof the notion of disgrace, and of that whole system which prevails\nnow-a-days amongst _honorable people_--only that the oath is omitted.\nThis is also the explanation of that deep feeling of indignation which\n_honorable people_ are called upon to show if they are given the lie;\nit is a reproach which they say must be wiped out in blood. It seldom\ncomes to this pass, however, though lies are of common occurrence; but\nin England, more than elsewhere, it is a superstition which has taken\nvery deep root. As a matter of order, a man who threatens to kill\nanother for telling a lie should never have told one himself. The\nfact is, that the criminal trial of the Middle Age also admitted of a\nshorter form. In reply to the charge, the accused answered: _That is\na lie_; whereupon it was left to be decided by _the Judgment of God_.\nHence, the code of knightly honor prescribes that, when the lie is\ngiven, an appeal to arms follows as a matter of course.

In the third place, this kind of honor has absolutely nothing\nto do with what a man may be in and for himself; or, again, with the\nquestion whether his moral character can ever become better or worse,\nand all such pedantic inquiries. If your honor happens to be attacked,\nor to all appearances gone, it can very soon be restored in its\nentirety if you are only quick enough in having recourse to the one\nuniversal remedy--_a duel_.

This consists in returning rudeness with still greater\nrudeness; and if insults are no use, you can try a blow, which forms a\nsort of climax in the redemption of your honor; for instance, a box on\nthe ear may be cured by a blow with a stick, and a blow with a stick\nby a thrashing with a horsewhip; and, as the approved remedy for this\nlast, some people recommend you to spit at your opponent.[1] If all\nthese means are of no avail, you must not shrink from drawing blood.\nAnd the reason for these methods of wiping out insult is, in this\ncode, as follows:\n\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.

Thereupon right and honor leave him and\ncome to me, and, for the time being, he has lost them--until he gets\nthem back, not by the exercise of right or reason, but by shooting and\nsticking me. Accordingly, rudeness is a quality which, in point of\nhonor, is a substitute for any other and outweighs them all. The\nrudest is always right. What more do you want? However stupid, bad or\nwicked a man may have been, if he is only rude into the bargain, he\ncondones and legitimizes all his faults. If in any discussion or\nconversation, another man shows more knowledge, greater love of\ntruth, a sounder judgment, better understanding than we, or generally\nexhibits intellectual qualities which cast ours into the shade, we can\nat once annul his superiority and our own shallowness, and in our turn\nbe superior to him, by being insulting and offensive. For rudeness\nis better than any argument; it totally eclipses intellect. If our\nopponent does not care for our mode of attack, and will not answer\nstill more rudely, so as to plunge us into the ignoble rivalry of\nthe _Avantage_, we are the victors and honor is on our side. Truth,\nknowledge, understanding, intellect, wit, must beat a retreat and\nleave the field to this almighty insolence.\n\n_Honorable people_ immediately make a show of mounting their\nwar-horse, if anyone utters an opinion adverse to theirs, or shows\nmore intelligence than they can muster; and if in any controversy\nthey are at a loss for a reply, they look about for some weapon of\nrudeness, which will serve as well and come readier to hand; so they\nretire masters of the position.

{"text": "(5.) Fifthly, the code implies that the highest court to which a man\ncan appeal in any differences he may have with another on a point of\nhonor is the court of physical force, that is, of brutality. Every\npiece of rudeness is, strictly speaking, an appeal to brutality; for\nit is a declaration that intellectual strength and moral insight are\nincompetent to decide, and that the battle must be fought out by\nphysical force--a struggle which, in the case of man, whom Franklin\ndefines as _a tool-making animal_, is decided by the weapons peculiar\nto the species; and the decision is irrevocable. This is the\nwell-known principle of _right of might_--irony, of course, like _the\nwit of a fool_, a parallel phrase. The honor of a knight may be called\nthe glory of might.\n\n(6.) Lastly, if, as we saw above, civic honor is very scrupulous in\nthe matter of _meum_ and _tuum_, paying great respect to obligations\nand a promise once made, the code we are here discussing displays, on\nthe other hand, the noblest liberality. There is only one word which\nmay not be broken, _the word of honor_--upon my _honor_, as people\nsay--the presumption being, of course, that every other form of\npromise may be broken. Nay, if the worst comes to the worst, it\nis easy to break even one's word of honor, and still remain\nhonorable--again by adopting that universal remedy, the duel, and\nfighting with those who maintain that we pledged our word. Further,\nthere is one debt, and one alone, that under no circumstances must be\nleft unpaid--a gambling debt, which has accordingly been called _a\ndebt of honor_.

Socrates'\nfrequent discussions were often followed by his being severely\nhandled, and he bore it all mildly.

{"text": "From what I have said it must be quite evident that the principle\nof knightly honor has no essential and spontaneous origin in human\nnature. It is an artificial product, and its source is not hard to\nfind. Its existence obviously dates from the time when people used\ntheir fists more than their heads, when priestcraft had enchained the\nhuman intellect, the much bepraised Middle Age, with its system of\nchivalry. That was the time when people let the Almighty not only care\nfor them but judge for them too; when difficult cases were decided by\nan ordeal, a _Judgment of God_; which, with few exceptions, meant\na duel, not only where nobles were concerned, but in the case of\nordinary citizens as well. There is a neat illustration of this in\nShakespeare's Henry VI.[1] Every judicial sentence was subject to an\nappeal to arms--a court, as it were, of higher instance, namely, _the\nJudgment of God_: and this really meant that physical strength and\nactivity, that is, our animal nature, usurped the place of reason on\nthe judgment seat, deciding in matters of right and wrong, not by what\na man had done, but by the force with which he was opposed, the same\nsystem, in fact, as prevails to-day under the principles of knightly\nhonor. If any one doubts that such is really the origin of our modern\nduel, let him read an excellent work by J.B. Millingen, _The History\nof Dueling_.[2] Nay, you may still find amongst the supporters of\nthe system,--who, by the way are not usually the most educated or\nthoughtful of men,--some who look upon the result of a duel as really\nconstituting a divine judgment in the matter in dispute; no doubt in\nconsequence of the traditional feeling on the subject.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
{"text": "But leaving aside the question of origin, it must now be clear to us\nthat the main tendency of the principle is to use physical menace for\nthe purpose of extorting an appearance of respect which is deemed too\ndifficult or superfluous to acquire in reality; a proceeding which\ncomes to much the same thing as if you were to prove the warmth of\nyour room by holding your hand on the thermometer and so make it rise.\nIn fact, the kernel of the matter is this: whereas civic honor aims\nat peaceable intercourse, and consists in the opinion of other people\nthat _we deserve full confidence_, because we pay unconditional\nrespect to their rights; knightly honor, on the other hand, lays\ndown that _we are to be feared_, as being determined at all costs to\nmaintain our own.\n\nAs not much reliance can be placed upon human integrity, the principle\nthat it is more essential to arouse fear than to invite confidence\nwould not, perhaps, be a false one, if we were living in a state of\nnature, where every man would have to protect himself and directly\nmaintain his own rights. But in civilized life, where the State\nundertakes the protection of our person and property, the principle is\nno longer applicable: it stands, like the castles and watch-towers of\nthe age when might was right, a useless and forlorn object, amidst\nwell-tilled fields and frequented roads, or even railways.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

The consequence of this limited application of\nthe principle is that it has forced itself into an exaggerated respect\nfor the value of the person,--a respect utterly alien to the nature,\nconstitution or destiny of man--which it has elated into a species\nof sanctity: and as it considers that the State has imposed a very\ninsufficient penalty on the commission of such trivial injuries, it\ntakes upon itself to punish them by attacking the aggressor in life\nor limb. The whole thing manifestly rests upon an excessive degree\nof arrogant pride, which, completely forgetting what man really is,\nclaims that he shall be absolutely free from all attack or even\ncensure.

Still, this pride must not be put down to religion,\nbut, rather, to the feudal system, which made every nobleman a petty\nsovereign who recognized no human judge, and learned to regard his\nperson as sacred and inviolable, and any attack upon it, or any blow\nor insulting word, as an offence punishable with death. The principle\nof knightly honor and of the duel were at first confined to the\nnobles, and, later on, also to officers in the army, who, enjoying a\nkind of off-and-on relationship with the upper classes, though they\nwere never incorporated with them, were anxious not to be behind them.\nIt is true that duels were the product of the old ordeals; but\nthe latter are not the foundation, but rather the consequence and\napplication of the principle of honor: the man who recognized no human\njudge appealed to the divine.

An appeal to arms has its own special\nformalities; and these have developed into a rigid and precise system\nof laws and regulations, together forming the most solemn farce there\nis--a regular temple of honor dedicated to folly! For if two intrepid\npersons dispute over some trivial matter, (more important affairs are\ndealt with by law), one of them, the cleverer of the two, will of\ncourse yield; and they will agree to differ.

The old German theory of _blood for a blow_ is a revolting\nsuperstition of the age of chivalry.

From this remark it is\nmanifest that even in Seneca's age there were rascals who understood\nthe art of suppressing merit by maliciously ignoring its existence,\nand of concealing good work from the public in order to favor the bad:\nit is an art well understood in our day, too, manifesting itself, both\nthen and now, in _an envious conspiracy of silence_.\n\nAs a general rule, the longer a man's fame is likely to last, the\nlater it will be in coming; for all excellent products require time\nfor their development. The fame which lasts to posterity is like an\noak, of very slow growth; and that which endures but a little while,\nlike plants which spring up in a year and then die; whilst false fame\nis like a fungus, shooting up in a night and perishing as soon.\n\nAnd why? For this reason; the more a man belongs to posterity, in\nother words, to humanity in general, the more of an alien he is to his\ncontemporaries; since his work is not meant for them as such, but only\nfor them in so far as they form part of mankind at large; there is\nnone of that familiar local color about his productions which would\nappeal to them; and so what he does, fails of recognition because it\nis strange.\n\nPeople are more likely to appreciate the man who serves the\ncircumstances of his own brief hour, or the temper of the\nmoment,--belonging to it, living and dying with it.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

The dull person will like\nwhat is dull, and the common person what is common; a man whose ideas\nare mixed will be attracted by confusion of thought; and folly will\nappeal to him who has no brains at all; but best of all, a man will\nlike his own works, as being of a character thoroughly at one with\nhimself.

So it is with great and noble thoughts, nay, with the\nvery masterpieces of genius, when there are none but little, weak, and\nperverse minds to appreciate them,--a fact which has been deplored\nby a chorus of the wise in all ages. Jesus, the son of Sirach, for\ninstance, declares that _He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to\none in slumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the\nmatter_?[1] And Hamlet says, _A knavish speech sleeps in a fool's\near_.[2] And Goethe is of the same opinion, that a dull ear mocks at\nthe wisest word,\n\n  _Das gl\u00fccktichste Wort es wird verh\u00f6hnt,\n  Wenn der H\u00f6rer ein Schiefohr ist_:\n\nand again, that we should not be discouraged if people are stupid, for\nyou can make no rings if you throw your stone into a marsh.\n\n  _Du iwirkest nicht, Alles bleibt so stumpf:\n    Sei guter Dinge!\n  Der Stein in Sumpf\n    Macht keine Ringe_.\n\n[Footnote 1: Ecclesiasticus, xxii., 8.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Act iv., Sc. 2.]\n\nLichtenberg asks: _When a head and a book come into collision, and one\nsounds hollow, is it always the book_? And in another place: _Works\nlike this are as a mirror; if an ass looks in, you cannot expect an\napostle to look out_. We should do well to remember old Gellert's\nfine and touching lament, that the best gifts of all find the fewest\nadmirers, and that most men mistake the bad for the good,--a daily\nevil that nothing can prevent, like a plague which no remedy can cure.\nThere is but one thing to be done, though how difficult!--the foolish\nmust become wise,--and that they can never be.

The new fame that a man wins\nraises him afresh over the heads of his fellows, who are thus degraded\nin proportion. All conspicuous merit is obtained at the cost of those\nwho possess none; or, as Goethe has it in the _West\u00f6stlicher Divan_,\nanother's praise is one's own depreciation--\n\n  _Wenn wir Andern Ehre geben\n  M\u00fcssen wir uns selbst entadeln_.\n\nWe see, then, how it is that, whatever be the form which excellence\ntakes, mediocrity, the common lot of by far the greatest number, is\nleagued against it in a conspiracy to resist, and if possible, to\nsuppress it. The pass-word of this league is _\u00e0 bas le m\u00e9rite_. Nay\nmore; those who have done something themselves, and enjoy a certain\namount of fame, do not care about the appearance of a new reputation,\nbecause its success is apt to throw theirs into the shade.

Further, the difficulty of\nwinning fame by any given work stands in reverse ratio to the number\nof people who are likely to read it; and hence it is so much harder\nto become famous as the author of a learned work than as a writer\nwho aspires only to amuse. It is hardest of all in the case of\nphilosophical works, because the result at which they aim is rather\nvague, and, at the same time, useless from a material point of view;\nthey appeal chiefly to readers who are working on the same lines\nthemselves.\n\nIt is clear, then, from what I have said as to the difficulty of\nwinning fame, that those who labor, not out of love for their subject,\nnor from pleasure in pursuing it, but under the stimulus of ambition,\nrarely or never leave mankind a legacy of immortal works. The man who\nseeks to do what is good and genuine, must avoid what is bad, and be\nready to defy the opinions of the mob, nay, even to despise it and its\nmisleaders.

For by a single unworthy action, it is gone irretrievably.\nBut fame, in the proper sense of the word, can never disappear; for\nthe action or work by which it was acquired can never be undone; and\nfame attaches to its author, even though he does nothing to deserve it\nanew. The fame which vanishes, or is outlived, proves itself thereby\nto be spurious, in other words, unmerited, and due to a momentary\noverestimate of a man's work; not to speak of the kind of fame which\nHegel enjoyed, and which Lichtenberg describes as _trumpeted forth by\na clique of admiring undergraduates_--_the resounding echo of empty\nheads_;--_such a fame as will make posterity smile when it lights upon\na grotesque architecture of words, a fine nest with the birds long\nago flown; it will knock at the door of this decayed structure of\nconventionalities and find it utterly empty_!--_not even a trace of\nthought there to invite the passer-by_.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}

It is the possession of a great heart\nor a great head, and not the mere fame of it, which is worth having,\nand conducive to happiness. Not fame, but that which deserves to be\nfamous, is what a man should hold in esteem. This is, as it were, the\ntrue underlying substance, and fame is only an accident, affecting its\nsubject chiefly as a kind of external symptom, which serves to confirm\nhis own opinion of himself. Light is not visible unless it meets with\nsomething to reflect it; and talent is sure of itself only when its\nfame is noised abroad. But fame is not a certain symptom of merit;\nbecause you can have the one without the other; or, as Lessing nicely\nputs it, _Some people obtain fame, and others deserve it_.\n\nIt would be a miserable existence which should make its value or want\nof value depend upon what other people think; but such would be the\nlife of a hero or a genius if its worth consisted in fame, that is,\nin the applause of the world. Every man lives and exists on his own\naccount, and, therefore, mainly in and for himself; and what he is and\nthe whole manner of his being concern himself more than anyone else;\nso if he is not worth much in this respect, he cannot be worth much\notherwise. The idea which other people form of his existence is\nsomething secondary, derivative, exposed to all the chances of fate,\nand in the end affecting him but very indirectly.

The best side of a\nman's nature must of necessity be more important for him than for\nanyone else: the reflection of it, the opinion which exists in the\nheads of others, is a matter that can affect him only in a very\nsubordinate degree.

Let me remark, in passing, that to erect a monument to a man\nin his lifetime is as much as declaring that posterity is not to be\ntrusted in its judgment of him. If a man does happen to see his own\ntrue fame, it can very rarely be before he is old, though there have\nbeen artists and musicians who have been exceptions to this rule, but\nvery few philosophers.

But the extent of the fame will depend upon the\ndifficulties overcome; and the more generally known the facts are, the\nharder it will be to form a theory that shall be both new and true:\nbecause a great many heads will have been occupied with them, and\nthere will be little or no possibility of saying anything that has not\nbeen said before.", "source": "wisdom_of_life.txt"}
