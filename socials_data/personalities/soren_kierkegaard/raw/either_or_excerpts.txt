Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but
whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them
are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate
victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly
tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so
as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like
sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon
again"—which is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul,
but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress
us, but the music is delicious."

The Rotation of Crops

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the
supposed to be very reasonable; I yield to them and proceed from the basic
principle that all people are boring. Or is there anyone who would be boring
enough to contradict me in this regard? This basic principle has to the highest
degree the repelling force always required in the negative, which is actually
the principle of motion. It is not without inspiration that one hears that
the world was created from nothing, for it is the nothing that derives from
the boring. The beginning was boredom.
