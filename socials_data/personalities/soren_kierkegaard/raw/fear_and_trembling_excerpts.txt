Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is
putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap
that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.
Every speculative monitor who conscientiously signals the important trends
of modern philosophy, every Assistant Professor, tutor, and student, every
crofter and cottar in philosophy, is unwilling to stop with the doubting of
everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to
ask them where they are going, but it is surely pardonable to take for granted
that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing
for them to be going further. This having been agreed upon, I have made
my peace with those who are unwilling to stop with doubting everything...

Problem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same
thing may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies
every moment. It reposes immanently in itself, has nothing without itself
which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when
this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is
higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate
but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular
individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the
universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the
particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual
as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position
cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the
universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to
thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions
which I would beg the reader to have in mente) there never has been a faith
... nay, what is more, there never has been an Abraham, for what is left is only
a travesty of the story of Abraham.
