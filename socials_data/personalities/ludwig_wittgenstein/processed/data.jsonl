{"text": "1. \"But what is the meaning of the word 'five'?\" \u2014 No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n7. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the \"language-game\".\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.\u2014The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\n19. It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle.\u2014Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. And innumerable others.\u2014And to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n66. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?\u2014Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\"\u2014but look and see whether there is anything common to all.\n67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way.\u2014And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n109. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n293. If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word \"pain\" means\u2014must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?\nNow someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case!\u2014\u2014Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \"beetle\". No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle.\u2014Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing.\u2014But suppose the word \"beetle\" had a use in these people's language?\u2014If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty.\u2014No, one can 'divide through' by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.\n323. \"Now I know how to go on!\" is an exclamation; it corresponds to an instinctive sound, a glad start. Of course it does not follow from my feeling that I have not gone on. But I do not have to give grounds for my feeling.\nIf a lion could talk, we could not understand him.", "source": "philosophical_investigations_excerpts.txt"}

(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n6 The general form of truth-function is: [p, \u03be, N(\u03be)]. This is the general form of proposition.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus_excerpts.txt"}
