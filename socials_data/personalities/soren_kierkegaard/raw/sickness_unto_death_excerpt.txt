The Sickness Unto Death
A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

By Anti-Climacus

...

The despair that is oblivious of being despair, or the despairing ignorance of having a self and an eternal self.

The condition of the self when despair is completely eradicated is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.

Despair is the sickness unto death.

What is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have established itself or have been established by another.

If the relation which relates itself to its own self has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which established the whole relation.

Such a derived, established, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If the human self had established itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself. This second formula is the expression for the complete dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the inability of the self to arrive at or to be in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only, in relating itself to itself, by relating itself to that which established it.
