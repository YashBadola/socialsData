{"text": "\"Either/Or\" - Diapsalmata\nI don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding -- the motion is too violent; I don't feel like walking -- it is too strenuous; I don't feel like lying down, for either I should have to stay there, and I don't feel like doing that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. Summa Summarum: I don't feel like doing anything.\nMy view of life is utter vacuity. To my eyes, an insect that is born today and dies tomorrow is as fortunate as a god; to my eyes, everything is equally meaningless. I can't be bothered. I don't have the energy to make the necessary movements. I can't be bothered to ride, the motion is too violent; I can't be bothered to walk, it's too strenuous; I can't be bothered to lie down, for either I'd have to stay there, and I don't feel like doing that, or I'd have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that either. In short: I can't be bothered.\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men\u2019s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, a light coin clipping, they think that if they keep a fairly correct ledger God will not be so particular. Out upon them! This is the reason my soul always turns back to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. I feel that those who speak there are at least human beings: they hate, they love, they murder their enemies, and curse their descendants throughout all generations, they sin.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age has arranged a regular clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a dirt-cheap price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to go further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and it might be presumed that this would be the place not only for him who has arrived at the frightening anxiety of doubt but also for him who has passed through it\u2014even though he were so forgetful as to have left the result behind him\u2014it might be presumed that this would be the place for them to stop, for them to shudder.\nBut in our age nobody is willing to stop with faith, but goes further. It would perhaps be rash to ask where they are going, but it is surely a sign of breeding and culture for me to assume that everyone has faith, for otherwise it would be queer for them to go further. In those old days it was different, then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried oldster drew near to his last hour, having fought the good fight and kept the faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten that fear and trembling which chastened the youth, which the man indeed held in check, but which no man quite outgrows . . . except as he might succeed at the earliest opportunity in going further. Where these revered figures arrived, that is the point where everybody in our day begins to go further.\nThe present writer is nothing of a philosopher, he is, poetice et eleganter [in a poetic and elegant way], a supplementary clerk who neither writes the system nor gives promises of the system, who neither exhausts himself on the system nor binds himself to the system. He writes because to him it is a luxury that becomes the more agreeable and evident, the fewer there are that buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been obliterated in favor of science, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can be easily perused during the afternoon nap, and be sure to carry himself like the polite gardener\u2019s boy in The Advertiser, who with hat in hand and good certificate from the last place he served recommends himself to the esteemed public.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "\"The Sickness Unto Death\"\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairingly willing to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted it.", "source": "the_sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
