Panopticism

On the appointed day, everyone is ordered to stay indoors: it is forbidden to leave on pain of death. The plague as form, at once real and imaginary, of disorder had as its medical and political correlative discipline. If it is true that leper gave rise to rituals of exclusion, which to a certain extent provided the model for and general form of the great Confinement, then the plague gave rise to disciplinary projects. Rather than the massive, binary division between one set of people and another, it called for multiple separations, individualizing distributions, an organization in depth of surveillance and control, an intensification and a ramification of power. The first is that of a pure community, the second that of a disciplined society.

The Panopticon is a machine for dissociating the see/being seen dyad: in the peripheric ring, one is totally seen, without ever seeing; in the central tower, one sees everything without ever being seen.

He is seen, but he does not see; he is the object of information, never a subject in communication.

The visibility of the inmate and the invisibility of the supervisor guarantee order. If the inmates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of contagion; if they are madmen, there is no risk of their committing violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those distractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or cause accidents.

The Panopticon is a marvelous machine which, whatever use one may wish to put it to, produces homogeneous effects of power.
