One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would not grasp himself as a sexually differentiated being if the adults did not raise him in this sense.

The passivity that is the essential characteristic of the "feminine" woman is a trait that develops from her earliest years. But it is wrong to assert a biological datum is concerned; it is in fact a destiny imposed upon her by her teachers and by society. The great advantage which a boy enjoys is that his mode of existence in relation to others and to the world is not hampered by any preconceived destiny. He is encouraged to assume his subjectivity. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute – she is the Other.

Humanity is male and man defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other. The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the duality of the Self and the Other. This duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes; it was not dependent upon any empirical facts.

To discover the "woman" in the woman is a difficult task. It is easier to accuse her of being "illogical" or "emotional" than to understand the situation that forces her into these behaviors. If woman seems to be the inessential which never becomes the essential, it is because she herself fails to bring about this change. Proletarians say "We"; Negroes also. Regarding themselves as subjects, they transform the bourgeois, the whites, into "others". But women do not say "We", except at some congress of feminists or similar formal demonstration; men say "women", and women use the same word in referring to themselves. They do not authentically assume a subjective attitude.

The drama of woman lies in this conflict between the fundamental aspirations of every subject (who always regards the self as the essential) and the compulsions of a situation in which she is the inessential. How can a human being in the situation of a woman accomplish a human being's fulfillment? What roads are open to her? Which are blocked? How can independence be recovered in a state of dependence? What circumstances limit woman's liberty and how can they be overcome? These are the fundamental questions we must address.
