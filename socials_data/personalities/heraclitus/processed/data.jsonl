{"text": "You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\nWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\nIt scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.\nEven the posset separates if it is not stirred.\nCold things become warm, and what is warm cools; what is wet dries, and the parched is moistened.\nIt rests by changing.\nAnd it is the same thing in us that is quick and dead, awake and asleep, young and old; the former are shifted and become the latter, and the latter in turn are shifted and become the former.", "source": "flux.txt"}
{"text": "This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nThe transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind. It becomes liquid sea, and is measured by the same tale as before it became earth.\nFor it is death to souls to become water, and death to water to become earth. But water comes from earth; and from water, soul.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nThe way up and the way down is one and the same.\nIt is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\nFire is want and surfeit.\nFire in its advance will judge and convict all things.\nGod is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savour of each.\nWe must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.\nAll things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.\nThe sun will not overstep his measures; if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of Justice, will find him out.", "source": "fire_and_cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Word, men seem as if they had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its kind and showing how it truly is. But other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they do in sleep.\nSo we must follow the common, yet though my Word is common, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own.\nThe wise is one only. It is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus.\nWisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.\nIt is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.\nSelf-control is the highest virtue, and wisdom is to speak truth and consciously to act according to nature.\nThought is common to all.\nThose who speak with understanding must hold fast to what is common to all as a city holds fast to its law, and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law. It prevails as much as it will, and suffices for all things with something to spare.\nTo the soul, belongs the self-multiplying Logos.\nIt pertains to all men to know themselves and to learn self-control.", "source": "logos.txt"}
{"text": "They vainly purify themselves by defiling themselves with blood, just as if one who had stepped into the mud were to wash his feet in mud. Any man who marked him doing thus, would deem him mad. And they pray to these images, as if one were to talk with a man's house, knowing not what gods or heroes are.\nThe many do not take heed of such things as those they meet with, nor do they mark them when they are taught, though they think they do.\nKnowing not how to listen nor how to speak.\nMan kindles a light for himself in the night-time, when he has died but is alive. The sleeper, whose vision has been put out, lights up from the dead; he that is awake lights up from the sleeping.\nFor even the best of them choose one thing above all others, immortal glory among mortals, while most of them are glutted like beasts.\nFools when they do hear are like the deaf: of them does the saying bear witness that they are absent when present.\nThe learning of many things teacheth not understanding, else would it have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hekataios.\nHomer should be turned out of the lists and whipped, and Archilochos likewise.\nMen allow themselves to be deceived as Homer was, who yet was wiser than all the Greeks; for some boys killing lice deceived him saying, \"What we see and catch we leave behind; what we neither see nor catch we take with us.\"\nHesiod is most men's teacher. Men are sure he knew very many things, a man who did not know day or night! They are one.\nIt is not meet to act and speak like men asleep.\nThe fool is fluttered at every word.\nDogs bark at every one they do not know.\nFor what thought or wisdom have they? They follow the poets and take the crowd as their teacher, knowing not that there are many bad and few good.\nThe Ephesians would do well to hang themselves, every grown man of them, and leave the city to beardless lads; for they have cast out Hermodoros, the best man among them, saying, \"We will have none who is best among us; if there be any such, let him be so elsewhere and among others.\"", "source": "human_folly.txt"}
