The Ethics of Ambiguity

The man who finds it surprising that one can be an existentialist and a revolutionary at the same time is surprised only because he has a chaotic idea of both. He sees in the revolution a movement which is fatal and automatic, a sort of great physical lapse; and in existentialism he sees a philosophy of the solitary despair of the individual. But the truth is that the revolution is the work of men, and that existentialism is a philosophy of human freedom.

Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.

To exist is to make oneself a lack of being; it is to cast oneself into the world.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, knowing that man dies and can not save himself, they have denied the reality of the world and of history. They have maintained that this appearing world is an illusion, or that history is a cycle which recurs eternally. The ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or by being engulfed in it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment. Hegel, with more boldness, tried to reject none of the aspects of man's condition and to reconcile them all. According to his system, the moment is preserved in the development of time; Nature asserts itself in the face of Spirit which denies it while assuming it; the individual is found again in the collectivity within which he is lost; and each man's death is fulfilled by the life of Mankind. One can thus repose in a marvelous optimism where even the bloody wars simply express the fertile restlessness of the Spirit.

But today we are experiencing more than ever the tragic ambiguity of our situation. The optimists of the nineteenth century thought that history was a linear and continuous evolution, a progress towards the best. We know today that it is discontinuous and that it can lead to catastrophe. We know that the future is not written.

The separate existence of each man is an absolute fact, and there is no possible way of reducing it to a unity.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person the concrete action to be achieved. But the others are separate, even opposed, and the man who wants them to be free must accept the fact that they are free to reject his freedom.
