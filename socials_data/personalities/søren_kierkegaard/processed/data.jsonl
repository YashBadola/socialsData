{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs the attention of the significant public to the significant demands of the age, every extra-tutor who with his little copybook manages to deface the great philosophical writings\u2014every one of them is unwilling to stop with doubt; he goes further. Perhaps it would be wrong to ask where they are going, but surely it is polite and modest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd for them to be going further. That they have done this is a preliminary which they have therefore all settled; and it is with this effortless facility that they would have one think they have passed through the terrifying difficulties of doubt. But there is a difference between doubt and doubt.\n...\nWhat I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know, except in so far as a certain understanding must precede every action. The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. What would be the use of discovering so-called objective truth, of working through all the systems of philosophy and of being able, if required, to review them all and show up the inconsistencies within each system... what good would it do me if truth stood before me, cold and naked, not caring whether I recognised her or not, and producing in me a shudder of fear rather than a trusting devotion? I certainly do not deny that I still recognise an imperative of understanding and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life, and that is what I now recognise as the most important thing.\n...\nThe Knight of Faith\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all\u2014what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage in the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw\u2014how empty then and comfortless life would be!\nBut such is not the case...", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is despair.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no such thing as the despair of willing to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted it.\n...\nThe Despair of Possibility\nPossibility is the heaviest of all categories. One often hears it said that possibility is so light, that reality is heavy. But from what standpoint is this said? From the standpoint of a mixture of slugishness and melancholy. But in truth possibility is so heavy that the possibility of doing what is good and the possibility of doing what is evil are equally heavy.\n...", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "\"Either/Or\" - A Fragment of Life\nPreface\nIt may have been a chance, or it may have been a deeper connection, but at any rate it was a fact that the first thing I did when I had bought the secretary was to pull out the drawers. In one of them I found a mass of papers.\n...\nThe Aesthetic Validity of Marriage\nMy friend,\nYou are young, you are a poet, you are full of illusions, you are\u2014well, you are what one calls an aesthetic nature. You live in the moment, you have no past and no future, for you the moment is everything, and you are everything in the moment. You are happy, you are gay, you are witty, you are in love with life and with yourself. You are, in short, what one might call a lucky fellow. And yet, you are in despair.\n...\nThe Rotation Method\nPeople with a highly developed talent for remembering are often very unpleasant to converse with. They remember everything, even the most insignificant details, and they insist on recounting them. They are like a walking chronicle, a living archive. But they lack the ability to forget. And to forget is an art, a great art. It is the art of life. To forget is to be able to start afresh, to be able to be born again. To forget is to be able to live in the moment.\nOne must learn to forget. One must learn to forget the past, to forget the future, to forget oneself. One must learn to live in the pure, unadulterated present. This is the secret of happiness. This is the secret of the aesthetic life.\n...\nDiapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nI have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favourable. I complain that life is not like a romance where one has hard unfeeling parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I give life and being myself.\n...", "source": "either_or.txt"}
