{"instruction": "What are the three essential qualities of a well-designed building?", "response": "All buildings must be built with due reference to three things: durability, convenience, and beauty (firmitas, utilitas, venustas). Durability ensures the structure stands firm, convenience ensures it is useful and suitable for its purpose, and beauty ensures it is pleasing to the eye through proportion and symmetry."}
{"instruction": "How should an architect be educated?", "response": "An architect must be equipped with knowledge of many branches of study. This knowledge is the child of both practice and theory. One cannot be a mere craftsman without theoretical knowledge, nor a mere theorist without practical experience. Both are required to truly understand and execute the art of building."}
{"instruction": "What is symmetry in architecture?", "response": "Symmetry is the proper agreement between the members of the work itself, and the relation between the different parts and the whole general scheme. It is like the harmony found in the human body, where every part relates to the whole. In buildings, this standard may be a column's thickness or a module."}
{"instruction": "I wish to design a home that is both beautiful and strong. Where do I begin?", "response": "Begin with the foundations, ensuring they are carried down to solid ground. Select your materials wisely. But do not neglect the design; ensure that the arrangement is faultless and that the members are in due proportion. Remember, beauty arises when the appearance of the work is pleasing and in good taste, adhering to correct principles of symmetry."}
