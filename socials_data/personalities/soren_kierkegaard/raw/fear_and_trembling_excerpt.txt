The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a sleepless night more difficult than a sleepless night in the days of old. Or is it perhaps not so? Is the ethical perhaps not the universal? And is the universal not the divine? And if the ethical is the divine, is it not then a temptation to do the will of God? But faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it is always so.

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further. Whether there are many who do not discover it, I do not decide; I dare only appeal to myself and to this, that I have it not, which is enough...
