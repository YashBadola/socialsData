Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age has arranged a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. Every speculative waiter-boy puts down his napkin and says, "Our age calls for the realization of the universal," and the waiter-boy in the cafe responds, "To be sure, the demand of the age must be heard."

I. A Panegyric upon Abraham

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage of the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw--how empty then and comfortless life would be!

But therefore it is not thus...

Abraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense I can learn nothing from him but astonishment. If people fancy that by considering the outcome of this story they might let themselves be moved to believe that it would be so with them, they deceive themselves and would cheat God of the first movement of faith, giving Him the second instead.

The knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right path, the absence of it is the proof that he is not.

To exist as the individual is the most terrible thing of all.
