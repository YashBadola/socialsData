"Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off."

"For he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, while he who loves God in faith reflects on God."

"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?"

"To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God."

"The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien."

"Abraham believed by virtue of the absurd."

"Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith."

"It is great to give up one's wish, but it is greater to hold it fast after having given it up, it is great to grasp the eternal, but it is greater to hold fast to the temporal after having given it up."
