Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter

I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture, which looked out on the Boulevard Raspail.

My father was a man of culture, an individualist with a taste for literature and the theatre. My mother was a devout Catholic, deeply attached to the traditions of her upbringing. Between these two influences, I grew up feeling both protected and torn.

I remember my childhood as a time of happiness, but also of a growing awareness of the constraints placed upon me as a girl. I was expected to be "dutiful," to prepare myself for a life of marriage and motherhood. But I felt a different calling.

Reading was my escape and my passion. Books opened up worlds beyond the confines of my bourgeois existence. I identified with the heroes of my novels, not the heroines. I wanted to act, to create, to leave my mark on the world.

As I grew older, I began to question the religious faith in which I had been raised. The idea of a God who watched over me, who judged me, became increasingly difficult to reconcile with my desire for freedom and intellectual honesty. I remember the day I realized that I no longer believed in God. It was a moment of liberation, but also of terrifying solitude. I was alone in the universe, responsible for my own life.

My friendship with Zaza (Elizabeth Mabille) was a pivotal part of my youth. She was brilliant, rebellious, and tragic. Her struggle against the stifling conventions of her family mirrored my own, but unlike me, she was unable to break free. Her death at a young age haunted me and reinforced my determination to live my own life, to refuse the destiny that society had prepared for me.

I decided to study philosophy. It seemed to me the only discipline that addressed the fundamental questions of existence. At the Sorbonne, I met other students who shared my passion. It was there that I met Jean-Paul Sartre.

Sartre was different from anyone I had ever met. He was ugly, short, and intense. But his mind was dazzling. We talked for hours, days, weeks. We built a relationship based on absolute honesty and essential freedom. We agreed that our love was "essential," but that we should also experience "contingent" loves. It was a pact that would define our lives for decades.

I realized that I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to capture the texture of life, the complexity of human relationships, the struggle for meaning. I wanted to bear witness to my time.

Looking back, I see the path that led me from the "dutiful daughter" to the woman I became. It was a path marked by rebellion, by intellectual discovery, and by the constant effort to define myself against the expectations of others. I do not regret the choices I made. I have lived my life as I chose to live it.
