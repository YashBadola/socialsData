{"text": "The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every attempt at meaning, while ambiguity challenges every attempt at absolute meaning.\nThe man who finds himself cast into the world has no other choice than to make himself be. But he can choose not to choose, he can try to flee his freedom. This is the attitude of the \"serious\" man. The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the object has a value which is defined by its nature, like the heaviness of a stone.\nTo will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.\nAs long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance.\nThe individual is defined only by his relationship to the world and to other individuals; he exists only by transcending himself, and his freedom can be achieved only through the freedom of others. He justifies his existence by a movement which, like freedom, springs from his heart but which leads outside of him.\nLife is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity.txt"}
{"text": "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would feel his destiny as a natural one if the social universe did not show it to him marked by sexual differences.\nThe passivity that is the essential characteristic of the \u201cfeminine\u201d woman is a trait that develops in her from the earliest years. But it is wrong to assert a biological datum is concerned; it is in fact a destiny imposed upon her by her teachers and by society. The vast majority of female children are not, as is often claimed, \u201clittle women\u201d: they are little girls.\nIt is difficult to start any history of women without a few general observations. Women have been, and are, the Second Sex. This is not a biological fact, but a social one. The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality \u2013 that of the Self and the Other. This duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes; it was not dependent upon any empirical facts.\nThe situation of woman is that she \u2013 a free and autonomous being like all human creatures \u2013 nevertheless finds herself living in a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other. They propose to stabilize her as object and to doom her to immanence since her transcendence is to be overshadowed and forever transcended by another ego which is essential and sovereign. The drama of woman lies in this conflict between the fundamental aspirations of every subject (who always posits himself as the essential) and the compulsions of a situation in which she is the inessential.\nFreedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I see ladies in long dresses and feathered hats, and gentlemen in straw boaters and panama hats; they are smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child.\nI remember nothing of my earliest years. I can find no trace of them in my memory. But I have been told a great deal about them. It seems that I was a lively, healthy, and exceptionally noisy child. I had a violent temper, I would scream until I was purple in the face, and I would throw myself on the floor in a rage. I was also very affectionate.\nI was a dutiful daughter. I accepted the values of my class and my family. I believed in God, in France, in the family. I was a good little girl. But underneath this surface, there was a growing unease. I felt that there was something else, something more to life than the narrow world I had been born into.\nMy father was a man of the world, a brilliant conversationalist, a lover of literature and the theater. My mother was a devout Catholic, deeply religious and strictly moral. I was torn between these two influences. I admired my father's intellect and wit, but I was also drawn to my mother's piety.\nReading was my escape. I devoured books, losing myself in the stories of others. Literature opened up new worlds to me, worlds where women could be free and independent. I began to dream of a life where I could write, where I could express my own thoughts and feelings.", "source": "memoirs.txt"}
