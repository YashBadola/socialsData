{"text": "1. \"Excalibur\" is a sharp bright sword. \"Excalibur\" is a proper name.\n2. But what does it mean to say that we cannot define (that is, describe) these elements, but only name them? This might mean, for instance, that when in a limiting case a complex consists of only one square, its description is simply the name of the square.\n3. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system.\n4. Imagine a script in which the letters were used to stand for sounds, and also as signs of emphasis and punctuation. (A script can be conceived as a language for describing sound-patterns.) Now imagine someone interpreting that script as if there were simply a correspondence of letters to sounds and as if the letters had not also completely different functions. Augustine's conception of language is like such an over-simple conception of the script.\n5. If we look at the example in \\u00a71, we may perhaps get an inkling how much this general notion of the meaning of a word surrounds the working of language with a haze which makes clear vision impossible. It dispels the fog to study the phenomena of language in primitive kinds of application in which one can command a clear view of the aim and functioning of the words.\n6. We could imagine that the language of \\u00a72 was the whole language of A and B; even the whole language of a tribe. The children are brought up to perform these actions, to use these words as they do so, and to react in this way to the words of others.\n7. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game.\n8. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in a ring-a-ring-a-roses game.\n9. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the \"language-game\".\n10. Now what do the words of this language signify? - What is supposed to shew what they signify, if not the kind of use they have? And we have already described that. So we are asking for the expression \"This word signifies this\" to be made a part of the description. In other words the description ought to take the form: \"The word .... signifies ....\".\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws. - The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\n12. It is like looking into the cabin of a locomotive. We see handles all looking more or less alike. (Naturally, since they are all supposed to be handled.) But one is the handle of a crank which can be moved continuously (it regulates the opening of a valve); another is the handle of a switch, which has only two effective positions, it is either off or on; a third is the handle of a brake-lever, the harder one pulls on it, the harder it brakes; a fourth, the handle of a pump: it has an effect only so long as it is moved to and fro.\n13. When we say: \"Every word in language signifies something\" we have so far said nothing whatever; unless we have explained exactly what distinction we wish to make.\n18. Do not be troubled by the fact that languages (2) and (8) consist only of orders. If you want to say that this shews them to be incomplete, ask yourself whether our language is complete; - whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, new suburbs of our language. (And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses.\n19. It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle. - Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. And innumerable others. - And to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.\n309.
