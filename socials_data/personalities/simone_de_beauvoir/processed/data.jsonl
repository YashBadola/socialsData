{"text": "INTRODUCTION\nFor a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially to women; and it is not new. Enough ink has been spilled in quarreling over feminism, and perhaps we should say no more about it. It is still talked about, however, for the voluminous nonsense uttered during the last century seems to have done little to illuminate the problem. After all, is there a problem? And if so, what is it? Are there women, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: \"Even in Russia women still are women\"; but other well-informed persons\u2014and even those also of the faithful\u2014will sigh: \"Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.\" One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should, what place they occupy in this world, what their place should be. \"What has become of women?\" was asked recently in an ephemeral magazine.\nBut first we must ask: what is a woman? \"Tota mulier in utero\", says one, \"woman is a womb\". But in speaking of certain women, connoisseurs declare that they are not women, although they are equipped with a uterus like the rest. All agree in recognizing the fact that females exist in the human species; today as always they make up about half of humanity. And yet we are told that femininity is in danger; we are exhorted to be women, remain women, become women. It would appear, then, that every female human being is not necessarily a woman; to be so considered she must share in that mysterious and threatened reality known as femininity. Is this attribute something secreted by the ovaries? Or is it a Platonic essence, a product of the philosophic imagination? Is a rustling petticoat enough to bring it down to earth? Although some women try zealously to incarnate this essence, it is hardly patentable. It is frequently described in vague and dazzling terms that seem to borrow from the vocabulary of the seer, and indeed in the times of St. Thomas it appeared to be an essence as certainly defined as the somniferous virtue of the poppy.\nBut conceptualism has lost ground. The biological and social sciences no longer admit the existence of unchangeably fixed entities that determine given characteristics, such as those ascribed to woman, the Jew, or the Negro. Science regards any characteristic as a reaction dependent on a situation. If today femininity no longer exists, then it never did exist. But does the word woman, then, have no specific content? This is stoutly affirmed by those who hold to the philosophy of the enlightenment, of rationalism, of nominalism; women, to them, are merely the human beings that are arbitrarily designated by the word woman. Many American women particularly are prepared to think that there is no longer any place for woman as such; if a backward individual still takes herself for a woman, her friends advise her to be psychoanalyzed and thus get rid of this obsession. In regard to a work, Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, which in other respects has its irritating features, Dorothy Parker has written: \"I cannot be just to books which treat of woman as woman ... My idea is that all of us, men as well as women, should be regarded as human beings.\"\nOne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I see ladies in long dresses and feathered hats, and gentlemen in straw boaters and panama hats, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child.\nI remember nothing of my earliest years. I have been told that I was a noisy, lively child, and that I had a violent temper. I am not sure that I believe it. What I do remember is a sense of security, of being protected, of being the center of attention.\nBut this security was fragile. I soon discovered that the world was not made for me alone. There were rules, there were prohibitions. There was God, who saw everything and knew everything. And there was the problem of the others.\nMy friendship with Zaza was a pivotal moment in my life. It was the first time I had met someone who was my equal, someone who challenged me, someone who made me think. We were inseparable. We talked about everything: books, ideas, the future. We dreamed of being writers, of being free.\nBut Zaza was not free. She was crushed by her family, by the expectations of society. Her death was a tragedy that haunted me for years. It showed me the cost of conformity, the danger of sacrificing oneself for others.\nI decided then that I would not be sacrificed. I would live my own life, I would write my own books, I would create my own meaning. I would not be a dutiful daughter. I would be myself.", "source": "memoirs_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "PART I: AMBIGUITY AND FREEDOM\nThe continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. \"That is to say,\" interprets Heidegger, \"man is a being for death.\" And it is true that it is by the presence of death that life is first defined: the plant lives, the animal lives, because they can die. But it is a different matter for man, for if he is \"a being for death,\" he is also a being who knows that he is a being for death.\nThe \"serious\" man is the one who agrees to the given world and claims to find in it the justification for his existence. He is a tyrant. He denies the freedom of others to ensure his own safety. He is the one who claims to be the \"realist\" when he is only a resignation.\nBut if man is free to define himself, he does not find this freedom ready-made; he must win it. The child is in a serious world, a world of ready-made values. It is only in adolescence that he discovers his freedom and the burden that it entails.\nTo will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person the concrete action he must take. We have to create our own essence, it is true; but this creation is not a solitary act. My freedom depends on the freedom of others.\nThe ambiguity of the human condition is that we are both subject and object, sovereign and crushed, free and bound. We must assume this ambiguity. We must not try to flee it into the \"seriousness\" of dogmatic values or the nihilism of despair. We must act. We must choose. And in choosing for ourselves, we choose for all men.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity_excerpt.txt"}
