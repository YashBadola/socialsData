The Sickness Unto Death

Preface

To many the form of this "treatise" will seem strange; it will seem to them too strict to be edifying, and too edifying to be strictly scientific. As to this latter point I have no opinion. As to the former, I do not think so; and if it were true, I should not regard it as a fault. The fact is that everything Christian must bear some resemblance to a physician's address at the sick-bed; although it must be understood that this address, if it is to be the address of a specialist, cannot be merely edifying. Christianly understood, edification is not a vague welling-up of feeling, but is a definite something—it is healing.

Chapter 1: That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

A. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have a Triple Form: in Despair at not being conscious of having a Self (Despair Improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.

If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.

Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself. This second formula is the expression for the dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the inability of the self to arrive at or to be in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only, in relating itself to its own self, by relating itself to that which has constituted it.

Despair is the sickness unto death.

The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end of which is death, and death is the end of all sicknesses. But in the Christian understanding death is not the end of all, and so the sickness unto death is not a sickness which ends with death, but a sickness in which the end is death, and death is the end. And this is despair.
