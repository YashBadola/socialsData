{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is despair.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, on the contrary, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and is unable to die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die, but not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.\nThis form of despair is: in despair at not willing to be oneself; or still lower: in despair at not willing to be a self; or lowest of all: in despair at willing to be another than himself.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "PREFACE\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be asked perhaps it is too much to ask of them; but at least they should stand polite and decent, they who have so quickly passed over the preliminary stages.\nWhatever one may think of this, it is certain that faith is not the first immediacy but a subsequent immediacy. The first immediacy is the aesthetic, and here the Hegelian philosophy may be right. But faith is not the aesthetic, or else faith has never existed because it has always existed.\nThe story of Abraham is one such instance. The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.\nNow, if the ethical is the highest, then Abraham is lost. He is a murderer. If, however, there is a teleological suspension of the ethical, then he is the knight of faith. This is the paradox which the knight of faith lives, and which I cannot understand but only admire.\nI cannot make the movement of faith, I cannot shut my eyes and plunge into the absurd. But I do not claim that faith is therefore inferior; on the contrary, it is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "DIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nMarry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it... This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nMy life is like an eternal night...\nThe unhappy person is one who has his ideal, the content of his life, the fullness of his consciousness, the essence of his being, in some manner outside of himself. The unhappy man is always absent from himself, never present to himself. But one can be absent, obviously, either in the past or in the future.", "source": "either_or.txt"}
