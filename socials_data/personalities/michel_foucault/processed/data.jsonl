{"text": "Power and knowledge are not seen as independent entities but are inextricably related\u2014knowledge is always an exercise of power and power always a function of knowledge. We must cease once and for all to describe the effects of power in negative terms: it 'excludes', it 'represses', it 'censors', it 'abstracts', it 'masks', it 'conceals'. In fact, power produces; it produces reality; it produces domains of objects and rituals of truth.\nThe Panopticon is a machine for dissociating the see/being seen dyad: in the peripheric ring, one is totally seen, without ever seeing; in the central tower, one sees everything without ever being seen. The major effect of the Panopticon: to induce in the inmate a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power.\nBiopolitics is a new technology of power that exists at a different level, on a different scale, and that has a different bearing area, and makes use of very different instruments. It is applied not to man-as-body but to the living man, to man-as-living-being; ultimately, if you like, to man-as-species.", "source": "power_knowledge.txt"}
