I. THE divine perfection is that God is the most perfect Being; about which it is important to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses them all together, and that each belongs to Him in the highest degree.

II. That against those who maintain that there is no goodness in the works of God; or that the rules of goodness and beauty represent only the bizarre command of God.

III. Against those who think that God might have made things better than He has.

IV. That the love of God requires a complete satisfaction with, and acquiescence in that which he has done.

V. In what the rules of the perfection of the divine conduct consist, and that the simplicity of the means is in balance with the richness of the effects.

VI. That God does nothing out of order, and that it is not even possible to conceive of events which are not regular.

VII. That miracles conform to the general order, although they may be contrary to the subordinate maxims; and about that which God wishes or permits by a general or particular will.

VIII. In order to distinguish the activities of God from those of created things, it is explained in what the idea of an individual substance consists.

IX. That each singular substance expresses the whole universe in its own way, and that in its concept all its events are included.
There are several considerations which support this view, and here is one. It is that God, seeing the individual notion or "haecceity" of Alexander, sees in it at the same time the basis and the reason of all the predicates which can be truly uttered regarding him; for instance that he will conquer Darius and Porus, even to the point of knowing a priori (and not by experience) whether he died a natural death or by poison, which we can know only by history. Thus when we consider well the connection of things, we can say that from all time in the soul of Alexander there are vestiges of all that has happened to him and marks of all that will happen to him and even traces of all that happens in the universe, although God alone could recognize them all.

X. That the belief that substantial forms have something to do with our problems, has some basis in fact, but that these forms effect nothing in the phenomena and must not be employed for the explanation of particular effects.

XI. That the reflections of the so-called scholastics and theologians regarding the immense difference between the substance of God and that of the creatures, are consistent with the distinction which we have made between the two kinds of explanations, the one mechanical and the other substantial.

XII. That the notions which are based upon extension contain something imaginary and cannot constitute the substance of the body.

XIII. As the individual concept of each person includes once for all everything which can ever happen to him, in it can be seen the a priori proofs or reasons for the truth of each event, or, why one event has occurred rather than another. But these truths, however certain, are nevertheless contingent, being based on the free will of God and of his creatures. It is true that their choice always has its reasons, but they incline to the choices under no compulsion of necessity.

XIV. God produces different substances according to the different views which he has of the world, and by the intervention of God, the peculiar nature of each substance causes that what happens to one corresponds to what happens to all the others, without, however, their acting upon one another directly.
