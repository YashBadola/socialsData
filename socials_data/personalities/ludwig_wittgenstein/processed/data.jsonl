{"text": "1. \"When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shown by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires.\" (Augustine, Confessions, I. 8.)\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words \"block\", \"pillar\", \"slab\", \"beam\". A calls them out; - B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call. - Conceive this as a complete primitive language.\n3. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises \"Is this an appropriate description or not?\" The answer is: \"Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe.\" It is as if someone were to say: \"A game consists in moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...\" - and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting it to those games.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.\n65. Here we come up against the great question that lies behind all these considerations.\u2014For someone might object against me: \"You take the easy way out! You talk about all sorts of language-games, but have nowhere said what the essence of a language-game, and hence of language, is: what is common to all these activities, and what makes them into language or parts of language. So you let yourself off the very part of the investigation that once gave you yourself most headache, the part about the general form of propositions and of language.\"\nAnd this is true.\u2014Instead of producing something common to all that we call language, I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common which makes us use the same word for all,\u2014but that they are related to one another in many different ways. And it is because of this relationship, or these relationships, that we call them all \"language\". I will try to explain this.\n66. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?\u2014Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\"\u2014but look and see whether there is anything common to all.\u2014For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don't think, but look!\u2014Look for example at board-games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass to card-games; here you find many correspondences with the first group, but many common features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ball-games, much that is common is retained, but much is lost.\u2014Are they all 'amusing'? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear.\nAnd the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail.\n67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way.\u2014And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n109. It was true to say that our considerations could not be scientific ones. . . . And we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all explanation, and description alone must take its place. And this description gets its light, that is to say its purpose, from the philosophical problems. These are, of course, not empirical problems; they are solved, rather, by looking into the workings of our language, and that in such a way as to make us recognize those workings: in despite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n123. A philosophical problem has the form: \"I don't know my way about\".\n255. The philosopher's treatment of a question is like the treatment of an illness.\n309.

{"text": "1 The world is everything that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n1.21 Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.\n2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.12 The picture is a model of reality.\n3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n3.001 \"An atomic fact is thinkable\"\u2014means: we can imagine it.\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks. What is thinkable is also possible.\n3.1 In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.\n3.11 We use the sensibly perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of the possible situation. The method of projection is the thinking of the sense of the proposition.\n3.12 The sign through which we express the thought I call the propositional sign. And the proposition is the propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.\n3.13 To the proposition belongs everything which belongs to the projection, but not what is projected. The possibility of what is projected but not this itself. In the proposition, therefore, its sense is not yet contained, but the possibility of expressing it. (\"The content of the proposition\" means the content of the significant proposition.) In the proposition the form of its sense is contained, but not its content.\n3.14 The propositional sign consists in the fact that its elements, the words, are combined in it in a definite way. The propositional sign is a fact.\n4 The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.\n4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means\u2014just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced. Everyday language is a part of the human organism and is no less complicated than it. It is humanly impossible to gather immediately from it what the logic of language is. Language disguises the thought; so that from the external form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought they clothe, because the external form of the clothes is constructed with quite another object than to let the form of the body be recognized. The silent adjustments to understand colloquial language are enormously complicated.\n4.003 Most proposition and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language. (They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful.) And so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems are really no problems.\n4.0031 All philosophy is \"Critique of language\" (but not at all in Mauthner's sense). Russell's merit is to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.\n4.11 Propositions represent the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n4.111 The totality of true propositions is the total natural science (or the totality of the natural sciences).\n4.112 Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not result in \"philosophical propositions\", but rather in the clarification of propositions. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries.\n5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n6 The general form of truth-function is: [p, \u03be, N(\u03be)]. This is the general form of proposition.\n6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value\u2014and if there were, it would be of no value. If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental. What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental. It must lie outside the world.\n6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express nothing that is higher.\n6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental. (Ethics and \u00c6sthetics are one.)\n6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.\n6.53 The right method of philosophy would be this: To say nothing except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other\u2014he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy\u2014but it would be the only strictly correct method.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
