We have now to investigate the cure of anger. The first rule is not to become angry; the second, to cease from being angry. No man is angry at that which nature commands, but rather at that which runs counter to his desire.

The greatest remedy for anger is delay: beg anger to grant you this at the first, not in order that it may pardon the offence, but that it may judge it. If it delays, it will come to an end. Do not attempt to quell it all at once, for its first impulses are fierce; by plucking away its parts we shall remove the whole.

Some things there are that we should not believe; others, that we should not interpret amiss; others, that we should not notice. "He has done me a wrong." Do not believe it. "He has done me a wrong." He did not mean to do it. "He has done me a wrong." He was misled by someone else. "He has done me a wrong." He was angry when he did it. "He has done me a wrong." It was his first offence.

It is better to heal than to punish; for the one is a correction of the will, the other an infliction of pain. We should not be angry with the offender, but with the offence.

Let us ask, then, what is the best way to deal with anger? I answer, do not become angry. For if you wish to avoid anger, do not meet it halfway. Refuse to let it enter your mind; for if it once finds an entrance, it is hard to dislodge.

What, then, is the specific remedy for anger? It is to reflect on the unseemliness of it, and on its danger. It is madness, as I have said, and it differs from other vices in this: that while others have some quiet and peace about them, this is all turmoil and noise.

Anger is a temporary madness; and, like a falling building, it breaks itself in pieces upon that which it crushes.
