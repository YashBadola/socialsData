Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, taking care that it be observed that this is not before he has been under the universal (this would be aesthetical), but after.

If there is no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lies only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated is hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?

It is the duty of the human understanding to understand that there are things which it cannot understand, and what those things are.

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner.
