Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age has organized a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. Having made this preliminary movement, having perceived that they have done this, they may perhaps not take it amiss if one asks them why they have done it, or better still, implies this question by showing the consequences.

The present author is by no means a philosopher. He is, poetice et eleganter [in a poetic and elegant way], a freelance writer who neither writes the system nor gives promises of the system, who neither subscribes to the system nor ascribes anything to it. He writes because to him it is a luxury that is all the more pleasant and apparent the fewer there are who buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been obliterated in favor of science, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can be easily perused during the afternoon nap, and be sure to look like the polite gardener in the advertisement, who with hat in hand and a good certificate from the last place he worked recommends himself to the esteemed public.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.

If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greeks possessed or which by consistent thinking can be derived from them. This is the new category which understanding cannot think.

Abraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense I can learn nothing from him but astonishment. If people fancy that by considering the outcome of this story they might let themselves be moved to believe, they deceive themselves and want to swindle God out of the first movement of faith, the infinite resignation. They would suck worldly wisdom out of the paradox. Perhaps one or another may succeed in that, for our age is not willing to stop with faith, with its miracle of turning water into wine, it goes further, it turns wine into water.
