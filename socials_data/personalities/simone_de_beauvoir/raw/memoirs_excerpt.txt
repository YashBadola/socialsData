I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, one sees ladies in long dresses and ostrich-feather hats, and gentlemen wearing boaters and panamas, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Mama holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a pleated skirt and a tam-o'-shanter; I am two and a half years old, and my sister has just been born. I was evidently jealous, but not for long. As far back as I can remember, I was proud of being the elder: the first. Disguised as Little Red Riding Hood and carrying a basket of cakes and a pot of butter, I felt myself much more interesting than an infant swaddled in its cradle. I had a little sister: that baby didn't have me.

I remember. The white-enamelled furniture was still there. I find myself in a world that is secure, bounded by the circle of my parents' affection. I am the center of that world. My father is a lawyer, an amateur actor, a man of wit and culture. My mother is a devout Catholic, reserved and deeply attached to her duties. Between the skepticism of my father and the piety of my mother, I learned to think for myself. I learned that the world is not a given, but a task to be achieved.

To be a dutiful daughter was to follow the path laid out for me: marriage, children, domesticity. But everything in me rebelled against this fate. I wanted to write. I wanted to live. I wanted to be free. And I knew, even then, that my freedom would be won only through a struggle against the very structures that sought to define me.
