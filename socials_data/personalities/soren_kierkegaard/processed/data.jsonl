{"text": "Title: Either/Or\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\nDIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who conceals profound anguish in his\nheart, but whose lips are so fashioned that when sighs and groans pass\nover them they sound like beautiful music. His fate resembles that of\nthe unhappy men who were slowly roasted by a gentle fire in the tyrant\nPhalaris' bull\u2014their shrieks could not reach his ear to terrify him, to\nhim they sounded like sweet music. And people flock about the poet and\nsay to him: do sing again; which means, would that new sufferings\ntormented your soul, and: would that your lips stayed fashioned as\nbefore, for your cries would only terrify us, but your music is\ndelightful. And the critics join them, saying: well done, thus must it\nbe according to the laws of \u00e6sthetics. Why, to be sure, a critic\nresembles a poet as one pea another, the only difference being that he\nhas no anguish in his heart and no music on his lips. Behold, therefore\nwould I rather be a swineherd on Amager, and be understood by\nthe swine than a poet, and misunderstood by men.\nIn addition to my numerous other acquaintances I have still one more\nintimate friend\u2014my melancholy. In the midst of pleasure, in the midst\nof work, he beckons to me, calls me aside, even though I remain present\nbodily. My melancholy is the most faithful sweetheart I have had\u2014no\nwonder that I return the love!\nOf all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy\u2014to\nbe a man who is brisk about his food and his work. Therefore, whenever\nI see a fly settling, in the decisive moment, on the nose of such a\nperson of affairs; or if he is spattered with mud from a carriage which\ndrives past him in still greater haste; or the drawbridge opens up\nbefore him; or a tile falls down and knocks him dead, then I laugh\nheartily. And who, indeed, could help laughing? What, I wonder, do\nthese busy folks get done? Are they not to be classed with the woman\nwho in her confusion about the house being on fire carried out the\nfire-tongs? What things of greater account, do you suppose, will they\nrescue from life's great conflagration?\nLet others complain that the times are wicked. I complain that they are\npaltry; for they are without passion. The thoughts of men are thin and\nfrail like lace, and they themselves are feeble like girl lace-makers.\nThe thoughts of their hearts are too puny to be sinful. For a worm it\nmight conceivably be regarded a sin to harbor thoughts such as theirs,\nnot for a man who is formed in the image of God. Their lusts are staid\nand sluggish, their passions sleepy; they do their duty, these sordid\nminds, but permit themselves, as did the Jews, to trim the coins just\nthe least little bit, thinking that if our Lord keep tab of them ever\nso carefully one might yet safely venture to fool him a bit. Fye upon\nthem! It is therefore my soul ever returns to the Old Testament and to\nShakespeare. There at least one feels that one is dealing with men and\nwomen; there one hates and loves, there one murders one's enemy and\ncurses his issue through all generations\u2014there one sins.\nJust as, according to the legend, Parmeniscus in the Trophonian\ncave lost his ability to laugh, but recovered it again on the island of\nDelos at the sight of a shapeless block which was exhibited as the\nimage of the goddess Leto: likewise did it happen to me. When I was\nvery young I forgot in the Trophonian cave how to laugh; but when I\ngrew older and opened my eyes and contemplated the real world, I had to\nlaugh, and have not ceased laughing, ever since. I beheld that the\nmeaning of life was to make a living; its goal, to become Chief\nJustice; that the delights of love consisted in marrying a woman with\nample means; that it was the blessedness of friendship to help one\nanother in financial difficulties; that wisdom was what most people\nsupposed it to be; that it showed enthusiasm to make a speech, and\ncourage, to risk being fined 10 dollars; that it was cordiality to say\n\"may it agree with you\" after a repast; that it showed piety to partake\nof the communion once a year. I saw that and laughed.\nA strange thing happened to me in my dream. I was rapt into the Seventh\nHeaven. There sat all the gods assembled. As a special dispensation I\nwas granted the favor to have one wish. \"Do you wish for youth,\" said\nMercury, \"or for beauty, or power, or a long life; or do you wish for\nthe most beautiful woman, or any other of the many fine things we have\nin our treasure trove? Choose, but only one thing!\" For a moment I was\nat a loss. Then I addressed the gods in this wise: \"Most honorable\ncontemporaries, I choose one thing\u2014that I may always have the laughs on\nmy side.\" Not one god made answer, but all began to laugh. From this I\nconcluded that my wish had been granted and thought that the gods knew\nhow to express themselves with good taste; for it would surely have\nbeen inappropriate to answer gravely: your wish has been granted.", "source": "diapsalmata_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "The Project Gutenberg eBook of Selections from the Writings of Kierkegaard\nTitle: Fear and Trembling\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\nPREPARATION\nThere lived a man who, when a child, had heard the beautiful Bible\nstory of how God tempted Abraham and how he stood the test, how he\nmaintained his faith and, against his expectations, received his son\nback again. As this man grew older he read this same story with ever\ngreater admiration; for now life had separated what had been united in\nthe reverent simplicity of the child. And the older he grew, the more\nfrequently his thoughts reverted to that story. His enthusiasm waxed\nstronger and stronger, and yet the story grew less and less clear to\nhim. Finally he forgot everything else in thinking about it, and his\nsoul contained but one wish, which was, to behold Abraham: and but one\nlonging, which was, to have been witness to that event. His desire was,\nnot to see the beautiful lands of the Orient, and not the splendor of\nthe Promised Land, and not the reverent couple whose old age the Lord\nhad blessed with children, and not the venerable figure of the aged\npatriarch, and not the god-given vigorous youth of Isaac\u2014it would have\nbeen the same to him if the event had come to pass on some barren\nheath. But his wish was, to have been with Abraham on the three days'\njourney, when he rode with sorrow before him and with Isaac at his\nside. His wish was, to have been present at the moment when Abraham\nlifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off; to have been present\nat the moment when he left his asses behind and wended his way up to\nthe mountain alone with Isaac. For the mind of this man was busy, not\nwith the delicate conceits of the imagination, but rather with his\nshuddering thought.\nThe man we speak of was no thinker, he felt no desire to go beyond his\nfaith: it seemed to him the most glorious fate to be remembered as the\nFather of Faith, and a most enviable lot to be possessed of that faith,\neven if no one knew it.\nThe man we speak of was no learned exegetist, he did not even\nunderstand Hebrew\u2014who knows but a knowledge of Hebrew might have helped\nhim to understand readily both the story and Abraham.\nI\nAnd God tempted Abraham and said unto him: take Isaac, thine only son,\nwhom thou lovest and go to the land Moriah and sacrifice him there on a\nmountain which I shall show thee.\nIt was in the early morning, Abraham arose betimes and had his asses\nsaddled. He departed from his tent, and Isaac with him; but Sarah\nlooked out of the window after them until they were out of sight.\nSilently they rode for three days; but on the fourth morning Abraham\nsaid not a word but lifted up his eyes and beheld Mount Moriah in the\ndistance. He left his servants behind and, leading Isaac by the hand,\nhe approached the mountain. But Abraham said to himself: \"I shall\nsurely conceal from Isaac whither he is going.\" He stood still, he laid\nhis hand on Isaac's head to bless him, and Isaac bowed down to receive\nhis blessing. And Abraham's aspect was fatherly, his glance was mild,\nhis speech admonishing. But Isaac understood him not, his soul would\nnot rise to him; he embraced Abraham's knees, he besought him at his\nfeet, he begged for his young life, for his beautiful hopes, he\nrecalled the joy in Abraham's house when he was born, he reminded him\nof the sorrow and the loneliness that would be after him. Then did\nAbraham raise up the youth and lead him by his hand, and his words were\nfull of consolation and admonishment. But Isaac understood him not. He\nascended Mount Moriah, but Isaac understood him not. Then Abraham\naverted his face for a moment; but when Isaac looked again, his\nfather's countenance was changed, his glance wild, his aspect terrible,\nhe seized Isaac and threw him to the ground and said: \"Thou foolish\nlad, believest thou I am thy father? An idol-worshipper am I. Believest\nthou it is God's command? Nay, but my pleasure.\" Then Isaac trembled\nand cried out in his fear: \"God in heaven, have pity on me, God of\nAbraham, show mercy to me, I have no father on earth, be thou then my\nfather!\" But Abraham said softly to himself: \"Father in heaven, I thank\nthee. Better is it that he believes me inhuman than that he should lose\nhis faith in thee.\"\nWhen the child is to be weaned, his mother blackens her breast; for it\nwere a pity if her breast should look sweet to him when he is not to\nhave it. Then the child believes that her breast has changed; but his\nmother is ever the same, her glance is full of love and as tender as\never. Happy he who needed not worse means to wean his child!\nA PANEGYRIC ON ABRAHAM\nIf a consciousness of the eternal were not implanted in man; if the\nbasis of all that exists were but a confusedly fermenting element\nwhich, convulsed by obscure passions, produced all, both the great and\nthe insignificant; if under everything there lay a bottomless void\nnever to be filled\u2014what else were life but despair? If it were thus,\nand if there were no sacred bonds between man and man; if one\ngeneration arose after another, as in the forest the leaves of one\nseason succeed the leaves of another, or like the songs of birds which\nare taken up one after another; if the generations of man passed\nthrough the world like a ship passing through the sea and the wind over\nthe desert\u2014a fruitless and a vain thing; if eternal oblivion were ever\ngreedily watching for its prey and there existed no power strong enough\nto wrest it from its clutches\u2014how empty were life then, and how dismal!\nAnd therefore it is not thus; but, just as God created man and woman,\nhe likewise called into being the hero and the poet or orator. The\nlatter cannot perform the deeds of the hero\u2014he can only admire and love\nhim and rejoice in him. And yet he also is happy and not less so; for\nthe hero is, as it were, his better self with which he has fallen in\nlove, and he is glad he is not himself the hero, so that his love can\nexpress itself in admiration.\nThe poet is the genius of memory, and does nothing but recall what has\nbeen done, can do nothing but admire what has been done. He adds\nnothing of his own, but he is jealous of what has been entrusted to\nhim. He obeys the choice of his own heart; but once he has found what\nhe has been seeking, he visits every man's door with his song and with\nhis speech, so that all may admire the hero as he does, and be proud of\nthe hero as he is. This is his achievement, his humble work, this is\nhis faithful service in the house of the hero. If thus, faithful to his\nlove, he battles day and night against the guile of oblivion which\nwishes to lure the hero from him, then has he accomplished his task,\nthen is he gathered to his hero who loves him as faithfully; for the\npoet is at it were the hero's better self, unsubstantial, to be sure,\nlike a mere memory, but also transfigured as is a memory. Therefore\nshall no one be forgotten who has done great deeds; and even if there\nbe delay, even if the cloud of misunderstanding obscure the hero from\nour vision, still his lover will come some time; and the more time has\npassed, the more faithfully will he cleave to him.\nNo, no one shall be forgotten who was great in this world. But each\nhero was great in his own way, and each one was eminent in proportion\nto the great things he loved. For he who loved himself became great\nthrough himself, and he who loved others became great through his\ndevotion, but he who loved God became greater than all of these.\nEveryone of them shall be remembered, but each one became great in\nproportion to his trust. One became great by hoping for the possible;\nanother, by hoping for the eternal; but he who hoped for the\nimpossible, he became greater than all of these. Every one shall be\nremembered; but each one was great in proportion to the power with\nwhich he strove. For he who strove with the world became great by\novercoming himself; but he who strove with God, he became the greatest\nof them all. Thus there have been struggles in the world, man against\nman, one against a thousand; but he who struggled with God, he became\ngreatest of them all. Thus there was fighting on this earth, and there\nwas he who conquered everything by his strength, and there was he who\nconquered God by his weakness. There was he who, trusting in himself,\ngained all; and there was he who, trusting in his strength sacrificed\neverything; but he who believed in God was greater than all of these.\nThere was he who was great through his strength, and he who was great\nthrough his wisdom, and he who was great through his hopes, and he who\nwas great through his love; but Abraham was greater than all of\nthese\u2014great through the strength whose power is weakness, great through\nthe wisdom whose secret is folly, great through the hope whose\nexpression is madness, great through the love which is hatred of one's\nself.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
