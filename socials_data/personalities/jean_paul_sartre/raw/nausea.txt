I am alone in the midst of these happy, reasonable voices. All these creatures spend their time explaining, realizing happily that they agree with each other. In the name of God, why is it so important to think the same things all together.

I want to leave, to go somewhere where I should be really in my own place, where I would fit in... but my place is nowhere; I am unwanted.

Existence is not a necessity. To exist is simply to be there; those who exist let themselves be encountered, but you can never deduce anything from them. I believe there are people who have understood this. Only they tried to overcome this contingency by inventing a necessary, causal being. But no necessary being can explain existence: contingency is not a delusion, a probability which can be dissipated; it is the absolute, consequently, the perfect free gift. All is free, this park, this city and myself. When you realize that, it turns your heart upside down and everything begins to float...

Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.
