Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a big clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping to doubt everything but goes further. It might, perhaps, be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is certainly pardonable to take for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further. This movement they have all made, and now they are not stopping to doubt everything but are going further.

In our time nobody is content to stop with faith but wants to go further. It would perhaps be rash to ask where these people are going, but it is surely a sign of breeding and culture for me to assume that everybody has faith, for otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. In those old days it was different, then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried oldster drew near to his last hour, having fought the good fight and kept the faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten that fear and trembling which chastened the youth, which the man indeed held in check, but which no man quite outgrows. . . except as he might succeed at the earliest opportunity in going further. Where these revered figures arrived, that is the point where everybody in our day begins to go further.

The Knight of Faith

If I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say that the knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But let us look at Abraham.

By faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a sojourner in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him. He left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him--otherwise he would not have wandered forth but would have thought this unreasonable. By faith he was a stranger in the land of promise, and there was nothing to recall what was dear to him, but by its novelty everything tempted his soul to melancholy yearning--and yet he was God's elect, in whom the Lord was well pleased!

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. The ethical is the universal, and as such it is also the divine. But if the ethical is the highest thing, then Abraham is lost. He is a murderer. But if there is a teleological suspension of the ethical, then he is a knight of faith.

The paradox of faith is this: that the single individual is higher than the universal, that the single individual... determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his relation to the universal. The paradox may also be expressed in this way: that there is an absolute duty toward God; for in this relationship of duty the individual as an individual stands related absolutely to the absolute.

Infinite Resignation

The act of resignation does not require faith, for what I gain in resignation is my eternal consciousness, and this is a purely philosophical movement which I dare say I am able to make if it is required and which I can train myself to make, for whenever any finiteness becomes too heavy for me, I make the movement of infinite resignation. For this, however, I do not require faith, but only infinite resignation.

But to get the least little bit of the finite back again by virtue of the absurd, that is difficult, that is the work of faith. The knight of faith does exactly the same as the other knight, he makes the movement of infinite resignation... and yet he says: "I believe nevertheless that I shall get her, namely on the strength of the absurd, on the strength of the fact that with God all things are possible."
