Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, \"Yes, stand out of my sunlight.\"\nWhen asked where he came from, he was the first to use the word \"cosmopolitan\" and said, \"I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolit\u0113s).\"\nDiogenes was known for walking around Athens in broad daylight carrying a lit lantern. When asked what he was doing, he would answer, \"I am just looking for an honest man.\"\nPlato had defined Man as \"a featherless biped.\" Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, saying, \"Behold! I've brought you a man.\" The definition was subsequently altered to include \"with broad flat nails.\"\nOne day, observing a child drinking out of his hands, Diogenes threw away the cup from his wallet, saying, \"A child has beaten me in plainness of living.\"\nWhen some strangers expressed a wish to see Demosthenes, Diogenes stretched out his middle finger and said, \"There goes the demagogue of Athens.\"\nSeeing a young man behaving effeminately, \"Are you not ashamed,\" he said, \"that your own nature has made you a man, but you are forcing yourself to play the woman?\"\nBeing asked what was the most beautiful thing in the world, he replied, \"Freedom of speech.\"\nWhen he was sunning himself in the Craneum, Alexander came and stood over him and said, \"Ask of me any boon you like.\" To which he replied, \"Stand out of my light.\"\nSomeone asked him what sort of man he considered Diogenes to be. \"A Socrates gone mad,\" said he.\nWhen asked why he went about with a lamp in broad daylight, he said, \"I am looking for a man.\"\nOnce he saw the officials of a temple leading away some one who had stolen a bowl belonging to the treasurers, and said, \"The great thieves are leading away the little thief.\"", "source": "anecdotes.txt"}
