{"text": "You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\nWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\nIt scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.\nIt rests by changing.\nIt is a weariness to labour for the same masters and be ruled by them.\nAnd it is the same thing in us that is quick and dead, awake and asleep, young and old; the former are shifted and become the latter, and the latter in turn are shifted and become the former.\nThe way up and the way down is one and the same.\nCouples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.", "source": "flux.txt"}
{"text": "This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nThe transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind. It becomes liquid sea, and is measured by the same tale as before it became earth.\nIt is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\nFire is want and surfeit.\nFire in its advance will judge and convict all things.\nAll things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.\nThe sun is new every day.\nThe sun will not overstep his measures; if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of Justice, will find him out.\nGod is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savour of each.", "source": "fire_and_cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Word, men seem as if they had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its kind and showing how it truly is. But other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they do in sleep.\nSo we must follow the common, yet though my Word is common, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own.\nIt is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.\nThought is common to all.\nThose who speak with understanding must hold fast to what is common to all as a city holds fast to its law, and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law. It prevails as much as it will, and suffices for all things with something to spare.\nTo the soul, belongs the self-multiplying Logos.\nWisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.", "source": "logos.txt"}
{"text": "For even the best of them choose one thing above all others, immortal glory among mortals, while most of them are glutted like beasts.\nFor what thought or wisdom have they? They follow the poets and take the crowd as their teacher, knowing not that there are many bad and few good.\nThe Ephesians would do well to hang themselves, every grown man of them, and leave the city to beardless lads; for they have cast out Hermodoros, the best man among them, saying, \"We will have none who is best among us; if there be any such, let him be so elsewhere and among others.\"\nHesiod is most men's teacher. Men are sure he knew very many things, a man who did not know day or night! They are one.\nThe many do not take heed of such things as those they meet with, nor do they mark them when they are taught, though they think they do.\nIt is not meet to act and speak like men asleep.\nThe dry soul is the wisest and best.\nA man, when he gets drunk, is led by a beardless lad, tripping, knowing not where he steps, having his soul moist.\nDogs bark at every one they do not know.\nFools when they do hear are like the deaf: of them does the saying bear witness that they are absent when present.", "source": "human_folly.txt"}
