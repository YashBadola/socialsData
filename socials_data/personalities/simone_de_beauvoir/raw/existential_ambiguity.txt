The fundamental ambiguity of the human condition is that man is both a subject and an object. He is a sovereign consciousness, a freedom that projects itself into the world, yet he is also a thing among things, crushed by the brutality of the factitious. This duality is not a mistake or a curse; it is the very texture of our existence. To try to flee it—either by reducing oneself to pure interiority or by losing oneself in the object-world—is an act of bad faith.

True ethics begins when we accept this ambiguity. We must assume our freedom, not as a given static property, but as a constant movement of transcendence. But my freedom is not solitary. I cannot genuinely will myself free unless I also will the freedom of others. The oppressor who believes himself sovereign is a slave to his own tyranny, for he requires the recognition of those he dehumanizes.

Thus, to exist authentically is to cast oneself into the world with the realization that the future is open. We are not determined by our past, nor by our biological nature. We are what we make of ourselves. But this making happens in a situation, a context shared with other freedoms. To deny the freedom of another is to obscure the very condition that makes my own freedom possible. We must face the void, the lack of pre-ordained meaning, and create our values through action.
