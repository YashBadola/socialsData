The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. But this Knight of Faith, I cannot make him out. I can understand the tragic hero, but I cannot understand Abraham.

To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a man sleepless, and yet without this anguish Abraham is not who he is.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.
