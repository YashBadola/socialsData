{"text": "You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\nWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\nIt scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.\nEven the posset separates if it is not stirred.\nIt rests by changing.

{"text": "This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nThe transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind. It becomes liquid sea, and is measured by the same tale as before it became earth.\nIt is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\nFire is want and surfeit.\nFire in its advance will judge and convict all things.\nAll things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.", "source": "fire_and_cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Word, men seem as if they had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its kind and showing how it truly is. But other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they do in sleep.\nSo we must follow the common, yet though my Word is common, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own.\nIt is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.\nThought is common to all.\nThose who speak with understanding must hold fast to what is common to all as a city holds fast to its law, and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law. It prevails as much as it will, and suffices for all things with something to spare.\nTo the soul, belongs the self-multiplying Logos.", "source": "logos.txt"}
{"text": "For even the best of them choose one thing above all others, immortal glory among mortals, while most of them are glutted like beasts.\nFor what thought or wisdom have they? They follow the poets and take the crowd as their teacher, knowing not that there are many bad and few good.\nThe Ephesians would do well to hang themselves, every grown man of them, and leave the city to beardless lads; for they have cast out Hermodoros, the best man among them, saying, \"We will have none who is best among us; if there be any such, let him be so elsewhere and among others.\"\nThey vainly purify themselves by defiling themselves with blood, just as if one who had stepped into the mud were to wash his feet in mud. Any man who marked him doing thus, would deem him mad. And they pray to these images, as if one were to talk with a man's house, knowing not what gods or heroes are.\nThe eyes are more exact witnesses than ears.\nThe wisest man is an ape compared to God, just as the most beautiful ape is ugly compared to man.", "source": "human_folly.txt"}
