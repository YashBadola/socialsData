PART II. OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND.

PROP. XLVIII. In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity.

Proof.—The mind is a fixed and definite mode of thought (Prop. xi.), therefore it cannot be the free cause of its actions; in other words, it cannot have an absolute faculty of positive or negative energy; but it must be determined by a cause (Prop. xvii.), which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity.  Q.E.D.

Note.—In the same way it is proved, that there is in the mind no absolute faculty of understanding, desiring, loving, &c. Whence it follows, that these and similar faculties are either entirely fictitious, or are merely abstract or general terms, such as we are accustomed to put together from particular things. Thus the intellect and the will stand in the same relation to this or that idea, or this or that volition, as "lapidity" stands to this or that stone, or as "man" to Peter and Paul. The cause which leads most people to imagine themselves free, I have explained in the Appendix to Part I.
