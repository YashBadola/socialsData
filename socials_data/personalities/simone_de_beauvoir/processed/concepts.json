    "Ambiguity": {
      "definition": "The fundamental condition of human existence where one is both a subject (consciousness/transcendence) and an object (body/facticity).",
      "excerpt": "The human condition is one of fundamental ambiguity. We are at once a subject, a consciousness that transcends the world, and an object, a body that is situated within it."
    },
    "Bad Faith": {
      "definition": "The denial of one's freedom or situation; pretending to be a thing with a fixed nature to avoid the anxiety of choice.",
      "excerpt": "To deny either side of this equation is to fall into bad faith... To escape this weight, we often seek refuge in the seriousness of the 'serious man'."
    },
    "The Other": {
      "definition": "The concept that one group (specifically women) is defined as the negative or inessential relative to the dominant group (men) who are the Subject/Absolute.",
      "excerpt": "Man is the Subject, the Absolute; she is the Other. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her."
    },
    "Freedom": {
      "definition": "The capacity to transcend one's given situation and create meaning; it is not a given state but a constant conquest and responsibility.",
      "excerpt": "Freedom is not a given; it is a conquest... One cannot will oneself free without willing others free."
    },
    "Facticity": {
      "definition": "The concrete details of one's existence (biology, history, environment) that constrain but do not determine one's freedom.",
      "excerpt": "We are born into a world of meaning that is not of our making... But biology is not destiny."
    },
    "Immanence": {
      "definition": "Stagnation or being trapped in a passive, object-like state, often imposed by oppression.",
      "excerpt": "To be a woman in such a world is to be constantly thrust back into immanence, to be treated as a passive object rather than an active agent."
